I've been inundated with emails and notes from various Alzheimer's charities and groups about their promotions leading up to World Alzheimer's Day on September 21. We're right around the 2 year anniversary of when my dad was violently taken from the house after trying to kill my mom, and thus he started on the horrible spiral that led to his death 2 months later. I can't bear to read it again, maybe I never will, but if you are interested it starts here. I can't imagine when I will ever be able to look back at the months of September, October and November 2007 without pain. Some days I can't even bear to think about my father. It's usually when I am alone, driving, when it hits me--a song on the radio, passing a store or restaurant he liked, or even a random chain of thoughts that leads me to think my dad was stolen from me and no matter what drugs they come up with now, I can never ever get him back. Then I drive the long way home, until I finish crying. Which is my excuse, I guess, for neglecting this blog. I think about writing, but it stirs everything up, and then I end up in front of my computer crying into my cat's fur. Here are some of the campaigns that have been brought to my attention lately. If I missed yours, let me know!
