I really enjoyed listening to David Martosko! It was nice to feel like we actually had someone who was in our corner. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0bbuuSGcdI      I just returned from the Western United Dairymen convention in Modesto. (I will blog about that later)

Upon returning as I was going through my many emails my son had sent this to me. It was created by the AG communication students at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo where my son is in his 4th year studying dairy science.

This video exemplifies the quality of students, facility and staff.  This video reward our sacrifice of putting you children through college, knowing that they are surrounded by the quality of the hands on experience. “Learn by Doing”.

To all of you THANK YOU! This is awesome. You make us proud and give us hopes of a bright future.


He put it all out there on the table to explain what we are up against. (I have provided the links below)  Martosko says the Humane Society of the United States masquerades as a protector of pets while plotting the demise of the dairy industry. He said the society is attacking milk producers as part of its effort to turn Americans into vegans. “They are not promoting kinder treatment of farm animals,” said Martosko, director of research for the Center for Consumer Freedom in Washington , D.C. “They are promoting the abolition of farm animals.” Martosko said many people believe that the society mainly funds dog and cat shelters when in fact it spends most of its hefty income on lobbying, salaries and political donations. He told the dairy farmers that Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive officer of the Humane Society of the United States , is “the biggest enemy you have.”

www.consumerfreedom.comwhen it finally warms up enough to BE out there...to listen, smell, savor the arrival of spring with all it brings. Ducks shuttle by unseen, but clearly heard, and geese are back on the river. No woodcock though.

No peent.

No wingy whistle turning the empty night into a whirl of wonderful music.

Then yesterday morning, just as I stepped onto the back porch in the still dark, not morning yet except by government time change standards , I heard him.....close too. I wonder if he moved his peenting grounds or if it was just so quiet that he sounded closer than other years.

He usually starts his sky dance up by the horse pasture pond. This year it sounds as if he is right down under the apple trees by the garden. He showed up on the 15th last year and the 27th in 08
March 29th in 07 but not until April in 06

Another waited for event had taken place as well. When I got to the barn in reindeer bathrobe, barn coat. and high rubber boots, Armada had finally had her first calf, another amazing red surprise, but, alas a bull. She was feeling sorry for herself and wouldn't even try to stand up so I came back to the house to get the boss to give her a bottle of calcium, which perked her right up. I CAN give bottles if I have to, but she was lying half under another heifer and I thought that someone bigger, stronger and with longer arms was called for. Both baby and mama are fine btw...

I am so grateful she finally got around to having him. She was due the 13th. We started doing barn checks a couple times a night about a week before she was due to calve....which adds up to a lot of 0-dark-thirty walks to the barn...in the mud...which is actually drying up just a tad.

Although E. E. Cummings found mud to to be a source of inspiration and delight, I personally find it to require me to sweep the kitchen floor about fifteen times a day in a cycle of endless futility, unquenched by ceaseless boot scraping..the outdoors just wants to come indoors during mud season.

**The photos above are an update of things at the pond in Lykers...still pretty frosty and not much around but a few chickadees. Just a few weeks and that will change.
