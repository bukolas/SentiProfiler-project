Women don't want a man that constantly says "you decide", "I don't know" and "whatever, you choose", they reek of being a little boy who can't make up his mind rather than a real man and giving her a response like this will really turn her off. If she asks something such as "where shall we go for dinner", simply pick an option that you would like to do. If she opposes and wants to go somewhere else she will tell you. She asked you the question so it's up to you to make the decision, telling her "you choose" will only frustrate her greatly.
