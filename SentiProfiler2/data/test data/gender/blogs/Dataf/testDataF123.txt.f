I call this colleciton "Polar Bear in a Snowstorm", LOL I've been picking up canvases ForEVER, so I sat and sealed them all with gesso. There's big ones that are a project for my living room, down to teeny tiny ones with little easels. Can't wait to work on them!

If unlike me, you NEED supplies, check out the Esty Supply Street Team (team esst) We have a total of over 25k great supplies, so whatever you need, we are sure to have it! I am having a special in my supply shop, INeedThat...Free shipping with purchases over $25! Its supposed to end at Midnight Sunday, but if you see something, go ahead and place the order, and just put in the comments that you saw the deal on my blog, and I will extend it for you!

Well, what else? I really need to get things out of the studio, so I have listed several things on ebay. You can see the link on the right side here, under "where you can find me", so take a peek there, and see if there's anything you need listed. Bids welcome!

Back to work...have that cutting board and the star boxes sitting here waiting for their final touches!
