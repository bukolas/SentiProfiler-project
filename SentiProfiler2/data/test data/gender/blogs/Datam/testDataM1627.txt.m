A couple of weeks ago, I was waiting at a traffic light, when a frantic woman came to my window saying she and her family had broken down on the highway; Could I help? She needed money.

I dipped into my pocket and found a $20 bill and handed it to her and moved on, leaving her behind.

Did she break down? I don't know. Am I a wuss for giving her the cash? Probably. 
But, something has happened to me over the past few years. I've learned from my failures that my successes are not that important, that it's important to stay in the mindset of failure, to be empathetic of those who are not as fortunate and to remember that success is often lucky.

So, as I looked at this, I wasn't going to judge. I was going to help.
