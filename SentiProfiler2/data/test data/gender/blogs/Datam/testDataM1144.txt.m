2. The lines between software, content and media are blurring. This has profound implications on system architecture and revenue models. There will be a prevalence of loosely connected services and MashUps versus tightly integrated software. Your system architecture and design has to accommodate that. We are seeing this today in the growing prevalence of SOA and S+S models (wikipedia these terms!).

3. The above fact fundamentally shifts the revenue model for applications. If your app is made up of disjointed heterogeneous services and content sourced (on-demand) from various entities, there is no longer a basis for a pre-determined cost for the service. The pricing and in turn, the revenue model will now rely on a lot of other factors such as usage, relevance and the all important "Advertising", especially if it will reduce the cost of the service to the consumer.

4. Like it or not, advertising is going to be the major revenue source for the new breed of internet based applications - it is a win win for both the parties (consumers and advertisers): The advertisers now see much better returns on their investments since they are reaching their ideal target demographic due to the self-selecting nature of the application and audience. The consumers are happy because a. their costs for use of the application or resource is subsidized or often completely free and b. they are served relevant advertisements for products and services that they may ACTUALLY be interested in given the context.
