I'm partial to March lion weather. The downpour has been nonstop, the winds are blustery and my toes are darn near frozen together but you can feel the seasons are changing nonetheless. Wore my scratchiest wool sweater today (knit it myself cause I can never find them scratchy enough) while I hunkered down in the shop and watched rain splash down the storefont for hours. Of course Saipua is a delicious slice of spring right now. Lilac, rex begonia, muscari, sweet pea, hellebores, snap dragons, hyacinth, parrot tulips, cherry blossoms. Even a rare canine cutest maximus complete with ivy garland. Appropriate only for a Red Hook rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream , staring Nea. For those not in possession of feet that can easily walk to the Met on the first spring like day of the year, allow me to personally escort you via dreamland for the next 5 minutes. Playing with Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage really hit me hard. Grace suggested I go and I was completely entranced. I was that girl who devours every inch of written word on the walls and lingers too long with her nose pressed to each and every piece. Behavior which I tend to find s anctimonious in others but don't generally hesitate in doling out myself when the time is right. The show focused on a trend of the mid 19th century- aristocratic women painting vignettes and the pasting photographs of the disembodied heads of their friends and family into the scene. The resulting albums are wildly clever and now my conception of victorian stuffiness is totally skewed. Not to mention these rich ladies were charming painters, in and of themselves. Just another reason why I should have been to born to Victorian aristocracy. Instead, I got yoga doing hippie parents in 1984. Not complaining..... Only a little. Checking my mail always makes me a little anxious. I know that 96% of the time there's going to be nothing good, or even worse, nothing at all. I've been getting a lot of letters addressed to my ex-boyfriend and I that advertise buying joint funeral plots. Depressing on so many levels. And yet I watch my mailbox like a hawk. Every Sunday as I automatically reach for my mail key, my heart sinks a little bit when I realize there's not even the tiniest of hope that something wonderful will be waiting inside. Until something wonderful does turn up. Last week I got a mini surprise sent to Saipua from Christine , a darling kindred spirit who reads An Apple a Day. The envelope had 8 vintage stamps used as postage- in the accompanying letter she explained that each of the stamps was inspired by a post on the blog. Seriously. Some people are so thoughtful, sweet and kind. I'm left in shock, wondering how I've turned into such a self consumed maniac. The inside she stuffed full with beautiful old photos, an old pullman car ticket and more of the same beautiful unused stamps. I have an idea of who I'd like to send them off to, but I think I've lost my nerve. Best to bide my time till I can figure out a good home for them. Old stamps feel like little time capsules, almost too precious to use. Maybe I'm still in the puppy love stage, but I'm not ready to part with them. Especially the fox one, that one's all mine. I've been going as far as to call it my preciousssss , which is the highest compliment I can give to anything, living or otherwise. I am fully aware of the futility of saying things like "Sorry I've been an absent blogger lately" and "I swear I'll be better". Most of the time when I read things that that on other blogs, I'm not even aware that they've been posting any less than usual. As much as it pains me to say, a lack of posting generally means I'm happy and busy with, you know, things not involving a computer . My interest and commitment to internet has been waning. Real life can be so.... enticing? Distracting? Exhausting? Also, a few weeks back I found of that there is a certain subset of grown men who are obsessed with amputee girls (no matter how small the um.. loss ?). The swarming hive found me and it's sort of turned me off blogging for a bit. All's rectified, the point of entry had been taken down, but it still makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Talking about it makes it more bemusing/bizarre and less terrifying. Sorry Dad. Just needed to get that off my chest. We're on to blizzard number 2 in Brooklyn and I've been making soup like it's my job. I finally bought a shovel to dig out my car and I'd probably still be spinning my tires if I hadn't gotten a 20 minute coaching session from a older Russian man who, through my rolled down window, gave me his philosophy on driving in the snow. When a man with a beard and a Russian accent tells you about snow, you listen. My neighborhood is charming. Full of characters- hipsters and grandparents and tony soprano types. We all share one thing in common and one thing only. Vinyl siding. Sometime in the 1960s, everyone got together and decided to cover every house on every block with it. My house is 100 years old and it has it. So does everyone else's. But the snow makes even vinyl siding look delicious. It turns a neighborhood with a face only a mother could love into a John Hughes movie set, but with more cultural diversity and higher rents. Girls with snowflakes and pinks cheeks are helped out by boys wielding shovels. Snow gets pushed into mountains and I get an excuse to sit in bed on a Saturday night. Cynics will be cynics, but I refuse to stop loving the snow. About a month ago, my big sister and I drove 2 hours to Doylestown, Pa. to go to the Mercer Museum for the first time. We got stupidly lost after stopping at Terrain and pulled up 10 minutes after it closed. There may or may not have been tears, foot stamping and devastation all around. On my day off last week (shock! joy! I had a day off!) I made it back to the Mercer and finally got to poke around. It's a history museum devoted tools and products used in early American crafts, trades and occupations. Basketry, meat preservation, coopering, cheese making, leather working, spinning, lumbering, medicine, solar salt harvesting, glass blowing and 45 other unbelievable exhibits- each in its own small alcove. I was really overwhelmed. I've never been to a place like it and was basically floating on air for 2 hours. The museum isn't heated and we could see our breath while inside, otherwise I could have stayed weeks. Months. Years. All of eternity. Bury me inside the hearse and coffin exhibit on the 3rd floor, please. Valentines Day has been all consuming this year. Funny, my first year without a real valentine in, gag, 9 years and I've been up to my neck in beautiful flowers and chocolate and paper hearts made from 1870s wallpaper. Working in the love business will do that. It's actually been very sweet to help boys all over the city give flowers to the girls they love. Luckily I'm not the bitter type, so I've been thoroughly enjoying my small peaks into other's relationships, while secretly feeling relieved to be alone these days. That being said, I did receive my first ever box of beautiful chocolates from a nice boy to whom I'm not related. A chocolate cameo. I blushed. I'm always blushing a little bit, I think. The flowers at the shop this weekend were some of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. For all of my satisfaction with my situation, oh gosh... I did slip off into dreams of receiving some of the arrangements we sent out the door. Sweetest and simplest of all were the antique medicine bottles with a single stem and a rex begonia leaf, tied with a silk ribbon. Hoping your day was as full of beauty and love as mine- borrowed or otherwise. Here is undeniable proof from the 3rd grade, that, indeed, I've always been like this. It's poster sized. I think the hand drawn USA stamp is a nice touch. Dear Laura, I understand you have been very busy for the past 18 years since I first wrote. I was really sad I never heard back from you, but I've gotten over it. Just wanted to let you know what a big impact your books had on me as a child. I remember lying in bed and just reveling in the knowledge that a salted ham wouldn't rot. I also hoarded half and half's from 7-11, shaking them all the way to school and wondering why they never turned to butter. Thanks for that. Love, Amy Little known fact- when it comes to computer stuff, I work exclusively from bed. I have a big old 700 sq foot apartment all to myself, with an eat-in kitchen, living room, office and bedroom but I can't kick the bed habit. Decadent, yes? A week or two ago I got this pillow in the mail from Liane at enhabiten . It's made from an antique crazy quilt and its revolutionized my office . Even as I type this, I'm cozied up to that quilt and that pillow. This is where this (gestures frantically to your open internet browser) happens. You know, the magic and all that.
