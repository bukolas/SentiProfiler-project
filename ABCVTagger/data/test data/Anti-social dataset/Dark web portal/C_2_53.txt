Quote: 2 bombings kill at least 7 in Baghdad By HAMID AHMED, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD - A double bombing killed at least seven people and wounded 25 Monday outside the Baghdad office of a government agency that cares for Sunni mosques and shrines, witnesses and a hospital official said. A police officer, however, put the death toll as high as 14. In the first attack, a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to the Sunni Endowment office in Baghdad's northern Azamiyah district, witnesses and an army official said. As people rushed away, a second explosion — believed to have been caused by a roadside bomb — occurred just yards away. The dead included Riyadh al-Samarrai, head of a local U.S.-backed armed group, said one witness, an employee of the Sunni Endowment. His account was corroborated by a member of the armed group, who gave his name only as Abu Omar, and by an Iraqi army official. Another witness, one of al-Samarrai's guards, said the suicide bomber walked up to al-Samarrai — a former police colonel — and embraced him before detonating his explosives. Most witnesses and officials spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals or because they were not officially authorized to speak to media. The differing death tolls could not immediately be reconciled. Associated Press The operation was claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq: Quote: Islamic State of Iraq/Martyrdom Operation Kills the leader of Awakenings in al-Aadhamiya, Baghdad Province In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. All praise and thanks are due to Allah. And may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and his companions in entirety. A brave soldier from 'Abu Omar el Kordi Battalion', 'Assidik Corps' and a knight of the Islamic State may Allah glorify it, from those who want to reap the apostates' souls and bodies to clean the earth from their and their leaders dirt. He went forward on Monday 07/01/08 and plunged with his full of explosive belt within a gathering of the awakening leaders of al-Aadhamiya and among them was their leader General Riyadh Assamira-i who was with his tails and followers in the region among Baghdad province. Our brave brother said Allahu Akbar and with a stone-hearted courage he detonated his explosive belt and, thus, gave his soul with ease to the Only god ALLAH, his Hassib. Allah enabled our brother to kill that rat who used to occupy the post of a responsible for the protection of Ahmed Abd el Ghafour Waqf. His son and companions were killed with him. Also, Dhiya-a el Hadithi was killed who's a well known leader, the husband of the parliament member Asmaa Adnan Edlimi, who's a member of Assamira-i Waqf. Ten other soldiers were killed and many were wounded when a bomb was detonated on them in the region after the martyrdom operation which killed at least 63 activists and wounded tens others. May Allah accept our brother in martyrs and make high his house in Illiyin Heaven. These operations were part of al-Karama (The Dignity) Plan "incursion of Hadi Ashuhada'a _Abu Omar al-Kurdi- (mercy of Allah be upon him)", which was declared by Ameer Al-Mu’meneen Sheikh Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (may Allah protect him), leader of the Islamic State of Iraq . O, Revealer of The Book, Mover of the clouds, Destroyer of the co-coalition (the enemies), destroy the co-coalition. Destroy the spiteful rafidities, the Zionist Crusaders and whosoever aids them. O Allah, make them and their weaponry a booty for the believers. O Allah defeat them, destroy them O the All-Strong, the All-Mighty Allahu Akbar "Honor, Power and Glory belong to Allah, His Messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites know not" The Islamic State of Iraq / Ministry of Information
