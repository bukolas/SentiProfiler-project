I have known Delbert for a solid 10 or 12 years now. We met at F.A.B. Church (Then Niverville M.B.) in Sr. high youth group. Delbert stands a full 6'5" tall (and as such is one of the only people I know who is as tall or taller than I am at 6'4.5"). He is 26, has dark hair which already has a fair amount of grey (likely from all of the crazy stunts he's pulled), a missing tooth on his upper jaw with a denture that he enjoys weirding kids out with, and enough experience doing so many different things that you'd think he had lived twice as long. He's currently engaged to be married to an awesome girl named Christina in June of this year, and has made the mistake of inviting me to be his "best" man.
Delbert is best known for his hunting/fishing/camping expeditions, his adventures in Paraguay, his stint as a drummer in a fizzled rock band, and his ability to smoothly transition from a full-bore cowboy get-up to a pea-coat and dress shirt in the same day.
As one of the only people that my son Rhys has listed as a friend, Delbert has most certainly found himself on the VIP list with both of my kids. They can always count on Uncle Delbert and Aunty Christina for awesome gifts at Christmas time. Two of my favourites have been my son's Carhart sweater, and my daughter's pink cowboy boots and hat. Truly stellar gifts from both a parent's perspective, and the kid's.
Del does the same thing that I do for a living: carpenter/cabinet installer. He's pretty well respected by both the company he contracts for (Kitchen Craft), and his clients. If there's one thing I've noticed, it's that he is a hard worker, and a really great guy to know if you ever need back-up.
When I bought my house in October, 2 years ago, I did some major renovating before we moved-in. Delbert just showed-up on the first night with a case of beer and a tool belt. He pretty-much was there for the full rest of the three weeks, working almost as much as I did, no need for me to ask. He's done a lot of things like that for a lot of people. I don't know any other guys who would do that, and that's maybe as much as I need to say.
Here's to Delbert (I am drinking a beer right now, and lifting it in a toast).
