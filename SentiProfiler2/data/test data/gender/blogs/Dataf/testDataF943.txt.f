I'm so far behind with my blog writing that there is no use trying to make up for it. I do want to document some of the fun things that I've done recently though.

A couple weeks ago a bunch of us got together for a "friend family" dinner. Amanda and Ryan, Audra, Laila, and me. Something we haven't done since the summer! We went out to dinner and then back to the Ashby house where we helped Audra put together the wedding gift she should've made a couple months ago. All the while we were listening to Johnny Cash music. Good times!

Last weekend I met up with Angel and we acted like 14 year olds. Seriously. I'm 26 years old and I lived through the boyband craze in the 90/early 00's without being one of those omg-i-will-cry-because-I'm-so-excited type girls. I never stood in long lines or camped out overnight to get tickets to something. To be in the middle of a crowd like that was really entertaining. We stood in line at a movie theatre for an hour so we could get good seats to see The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Really, it's kind of embarrassing to admit that, but we did it. And at least we weren't the oldest people in line. :P Drooled over Taylor "Jailbait" Lautner for 2 hours. I liked the movie, because it was true to the book. At the same time, the book was my least favorite of the series. For me, seeing this one was just a requirement to start waiting for Eclipse next summer. I know I'll love that movie, for sure, and it will probably make me cry. What? I have a soft spot for Jacob, and his pain.
