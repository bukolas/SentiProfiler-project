Just a quick reminder that tomorrow night Steph and I will be getting together with a lovely bunch of creatives at the Brisbane ABCD meetup ! Don't forget to RSVP if you haven't done so already! The goodie bags are already looking promising with these exclusive preview passes to the new film MICMACS by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie) ~ there is one double-pass for each goodie bag, kindly donated by Hopscotch Films ! Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of cinema’s most inventive and inspired talents and the creator of Amelie, Delicatessen and A Very Long Engagement. In his new film MICMACS, a man and his friends come up with an intricate and original plan to destroy two big weapons manufacturers, and in the process find answers to such questions as: Are zebras white with black stripes or black with white stripes? Can you get drunk from eating waffles? What's the human cannonball world record? Can a woman fit inside a refrigerator? Is it better to live with a bullet lodged in your brain, or have it removed? :: Read more about the ABCD meetups here :: I have been having such a great time playing along with Kirsty's Creative Space on Thursday over at Kootoyoo , that I thought I'd join in with another fun play-along hosted by the lovely Sophie from Her Library Adventures . Sundays are dedicated to Flea Market Finds... I've started experimenting with Christmas ornaments (sneak peek shown in my previous post here ) ~ and I wanted to find some new lace doilies that would suit the Christmas feeling, to give these ornaments their own unique patterns rather than repeating some of my existing range. I was hoping to find some patterns that looked like stars/snowflakes, and I could not have been more excited to find a few excellent doilies at my local St Vinnies! Below are some that made the cut in the end ~ not all doilies are suitable for pressing into the clay, but I'm very pleased with these ones I found! The one above would have to be my favourite ~ it is exactly what I was hoping to find! I think it is perfect for the baubles and snowflakes. I'll have to take good care of this one as it is very delicate... This one has a perfect star-like pattern for the ornaments. This one is not very suitable for clay-impressions, it doesn't leave a nice clean pattern ~ but I still loved it and thought it would make a nice display for markets. The one underneath is a cotton fabric with crocheted edge, also purchased for display purposes. Ch eck out Sophie's blog if you'd like to play along or see some other fabulous finds ! Playing around with new shapes and patterns this week... I've been wanting to create some butterflies for a while now, somehow the delicate lace impressions in the clay combined with the shape of this precious winged creature seem like such a good match. A little early perhaps but having missed the opportunity to create any Christmas ornaments altogether last Christmas I figured I better get myself sorted this year... Experimenting with baubles and snowflakes, working out which lace patterns are best suited to their shapes and the Christmas season... I've also put in an order for some new snowflake cutters in rather special shapes. Can't wait to receive them and see how they will look! I've also been finalising some prints on the lovely recycled paper I ordered to complement the kraft gift boxes for my ceramic pieces. I like to include a short artist profile with each customer order, with just a little background information on how my pieces are made. I wanted it to have something special to it so I asked my mum (who loves origami) if she had any ideas for some simple letter-folds. This was one of the patterns she sent me, I love how the paper just folds into itself to create a nice little envelope, no further packaging needed! It also fits in nicely into the gift box. Thanks mum! For more creative spaces head over to Kootoyoo!

Please excuse this late post but I'm sure you'll love getting to know her a little better as much as I have! Please tell us a little bit about yourself: "My name is Sophie Isobel, I’m a little bit 50’s housewife and a touch Alice in Wonderland and when I’m not teaching English and Literature you will find me in my studio, dreaming and creating. Inspired by the days of yesteryear, Victorian literature and the art of accessorising, I create brooches, accessories and artwork using my vintage typewriter and lovely scraps of fabric and ephemera that celebrate all my favourite things." Image © Sophie Appleby What is your creative background and how long have you been creating your art? "I’ve always loved making things, as a child I would create dresses from old tablecloths and curtains and raid my grandmother’s card collection for pretty pictures to cut out. Since then I have been collecting, journaling and chasing beauty and in the last two years my ideas have leapt off the page. I have a Bachelor of Creative Arts which is more focused on writing and literary theory. Playing with scissors, glue and fabric has always been an escape for me and I'm delighted that I can now blend these two worlds in my work." Where, what or who do you draw your inspiration from? "My world is a constantly inspiring adventure. I try to keep a really open mind and find inspiration in the little details. From the beautiful old architecture in my neighbourhood and classic children's books to antique shops and reading fabulous blogs, for me inspiration is everywhere." Image © Sophie Appleby What can you tell us about your work? "I am fascinated by the art of accessorising and always loved to sit at my grandmother's dressing table and look at all her beautiful pieces of jewellery. I love the idea of wearing something that gives people a little hint about your personality, something truly unique, so when I began thinking about accessories I wanted to create this was always in the back of my mind. My signature 'I heart' brooches are all unique, no two are exactly the same and I love that in wearing one you can celebrate what you love in the world." Where do you create your art and what is your workspace like? "I work from home in my little cottage studio, I love to surround myself with beautiful and unusual bits and pieces and am always on the lookout for lovely old boxes to store things in. My studio is constantly changing and I'm always working on an inspiration board or two, full of beautiful images. My favourite items in my studio are my grandmother's sewing machine and my library catalogue drawers. I always have fresh flowers from the garden in vases and tea pots and if the rapping of typewriter can be heard, you know I'm busy creating." What is your day job or are you a fulltime artist? "I'm also a high school English and Literature teacher, I love both my jobs and although there is never quite enough hours in my day one very often inspires the other. At lunch time you will sometimes find me sewing brooch backs whilst facilitating a creative writing workshop." Image © Sophie Appleby What are your goals/aspirations for the future? "I often say, when I grew up I want to be.. and the list goes on for pages. I have days I would love to go back to university and study costume design and others I'd really love to become a Librarian, so I can spend my days surrounded by books. I also love writing and would like to finish the novel I'm currently working on in the next few years. I am always doing at least five things at once and dreaming up new ideas, so my goal is to enjoy every moment and dabble in all the delights the world has to offer, whatever they may be." :: Click here to view all Sophie's work on Udessi :: The Finders Keepers have announced their market dates for 2010 and we're very excited they'll be coming back to Brisbane this year ~ as well as of course continuing their events at the stunning contemporary art centre CarriageWorks in Sydney’s Inner West.
