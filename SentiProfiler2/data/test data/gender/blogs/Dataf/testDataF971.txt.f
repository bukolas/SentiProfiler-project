Yesterday I finally got the result of Toefl ibt. It was really good: 109. I was so nervous before I pressed the button to reach out the score and there were thousands of butterflies in my stomach. But eventually that was it. In an instant I broke down because of the joy actually.

Now I am on the way to my dream. I have finished the first step of preparation of going abroad, which is to take part in English exams and make the best of myself out of it.In some sense, I believe God is blessing me or I should say my grandpa, who passed away all of a sudden five years ago.He is in the heaven and is watching on me all the time.
It perhaps sounds familiar to most of my friends because it was ever classic line in a Korean TV series. I didn't get the opportunity to see the series until recently in my leisure time have access to it on the school net. I was so intensely touched and deeply moved that I couldn't help crying out from time to time.

Then I draw the conclusion from it that one, who is full of love inside his or her heart, is not pathetic at all even if they live lonely in the world without any companions. True love will leave a long-lasting impression to those who engaged in even with the limited and transient time to share with one another.

I am sorry I can' t stay with you in this world, but please remember I love you forever wherever I go.
