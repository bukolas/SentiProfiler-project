Our frienship is a long road with millions of miles to lead.The Sky is our destination n im proud to have travelled 17 beautiful yrs in it. To be frank our friendship s the oldest of all and its always endless. The best thing about Edal is she has a lot of willpower n the courage to fight till she succeeds.She is so feeble at heart n gt the best helping tendency.The gal with whom i shall share my entire self n she s the one who knows n soothe me at real pain. The worst path of Edal....Lol I have to say it..Thou she knws the reality she doesnt stick to it.she wants to reveal the golden treasures where at cases it wud have really died n still she keeps longing for it.Poor gal pain is the reward she gets.My lovable idiotic friend at times maintains senseless silence n will raise me to a high blood pressure..OOOOOOOOOOOh i wud kill u monkey
