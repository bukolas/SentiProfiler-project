Custom computer cases that look like spiders aren't generally the sort of thing that are available to public, but Lian Li's new PC-T1R case is one big exception to the rule, and it's now edged a bit closer to a release. Previously only seen in a teaser video, a nearly final version of the case has now landed in the hands of the folks at techPowerUp, who have provided us with our first hands-on look at it. What's more, the site also says that the case should sell for "around â‚¬150" (or just over $200) when it's released, and that it will be available in black in addition to red. Of course, there will be some assembly required -- hit up the link below to see what's in store.
