I understand that while the first few days might be typical for a class, it shortly becomes their hardest and most grueling block with the pure mass of data they require you to learn.  This weeds out anyone that can't handle the workload right off, and anyone who is  not serious about animation.  It also gives student a good strong base to start with the 2nd block, which I understand to be mostly animation and mocap.  I think 3rd block covers the more advanced features, like visual effects and green screen.  And finally, 4th block is one big long class project.  Students have very limited creativity in the class assignments.  While they are encouraged to come in before or after class, and on weekends, to work on their own projects, so they can build their demo reel up and their skills, the class itself acts more like an actual animation studio, where the directors call the shots, and the animators have to make it happen.  Therefore, we have to act like animators to make their vision come true.  Students will have some limited creativity within each shot, but the majority of it is just to make the scene work the way it should.
