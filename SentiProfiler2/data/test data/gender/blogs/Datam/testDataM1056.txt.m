Now, you'd think the sight of someone in this condition, slumped over on a chair being held up by two people, among others in a waiting room who had only seemingly incurred superficial injuries would be enough to merit immediate medical attention. However, this was not the case. The triage nurse refused to allow her to skip anyone in line. After a half hour in the waiting room it was clear that my mom was getting worse. My dad is terrible in these situations. He saw that I was worried and like a good dad was trying to quell my concerns with lighthearted conversation but I was less interested in that and more interested with what status my mom might be in in another half hour. With that, I stood up and walked directly through the big swinging doors with large signs saying "No Entrance", "Hospital Staff Only", and other such signs. I found a Doctor and informed her that there is a lady, my mother, in triage who has not been seen and (in so many words) whose condition resembles symptoms of a heart attack. The Doctor came back with me immediately to see her. She (the Dr.) told the triage nurse to let her register right away, and when that was said the other people in the waiting room...this was after an hour of apathy...verbalized that my mom, who at this point could no longer move of her own volition, could go in front of them. With no beds left in the hospital, this only helped things marginally. In the triage nurses office there was a bed that my mom was able to lie down on. As the triage nurse took her vitals, she smirked an "I told you so smirk" and said "Her vitals all seem normal." As if to say "FUCK YOU" to this triage nurse my mom immediately began to vomit a bright green fluid. We had to turn her on her side because she wasn't able to move and we worried that she might choke. Seconds later, another nurse came rushing in to take control and my dad and I were kicked out of the room. The vomiting continued for about 30 more minutes. We were called in once more about an hour later to help move her onto a bed that had become available and we wheeled her into one of the curtained off areas where the admitted patients wait to be diagnosed. Sometime between then and when the nurse in charge came she shat her pants.

At this point, I was holding my moms hand beside the bed. I could feel it shaking in my hands but slowly the shaking subsided and my mom drifted off to sleep for about another hour (this was after nurses cleaned off the accidental defecation). If we got to the hospital at 6 pm, it was now 11 pm.
