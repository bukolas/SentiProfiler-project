First, we like say sorry to our English speaking fans. We strayed from what you like us for, so we want to make up. The request lines are open again. Is there a song you like us to perform? Let us know in the comments below. We will pick the top ten songs and let you choose in a poll what you think we should perform, and we will do our best, maybe in similar dormitory setting as background. We miss that. Update (1 Jan 09): We will close this request post 10 January, pick the top 10 songs, then let you vote on it to days later. You can make repeat requests if you like. Thanks for your input!
