Every month I complete of my project, I'm going to write a reflective follow-up on what happened (please pardon me that we are already one week into February): January Stats: 18 school lunches eaten included: (4 - pizza lunches) (2 - hot dog lunches) (2 - chicken patties) (2 - cheese sandwiches) (2 - pasta dishes) (1 - PB&J that I will never forget...) (...other meals you will have to check out for yourself...) What I learned about school lunch: 1) More people than I ever expected are interested in improving school lunch and reading about my misadventures. 2) School lunches normally consist of a main dish with some some meat product (often combined with a grain), a fruit product, a vegetable product, milk, and an additional grain if the meal needs it to comply with federal regulations. 3) The meals contain a lot of processed food items. 4) The food is bland and usually tasteless. 5) There is a lot of salt in the meals and they are low in fiber for the most part What I learned about myself: 1) I finally figured out that I'm lactose-intolerant (I wasn't drinking a lot of milk before so I never knew) 2) I'm proud of myself 3) I'm enjoying the project more than I expected
