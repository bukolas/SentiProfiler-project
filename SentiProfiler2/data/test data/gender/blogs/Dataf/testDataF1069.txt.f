This is a small little story about an outlandish girl named Victoria and a cheerleader named Kimiko. Even though they are different, they love each other. Read on about this little exert from their lives.

Victoria stops her car at the top of the mountain on the ledge with the wooden fence at the end. She steps out of her old, beaten up, black Mustang and sits on the hood. Victoria stretches out her legs and lays back against the windshield.


Kimiko very gracefully steps out of the passenger seat and sits on the edge of the hood of the car. “There’s a party at Jimmy’s place later. Maybe we can stop by?”


“Why, Kimi? So all your Hollister addicted friends can ridicule me when we show up?”


“You know, they don’t really hate you like you think they do.”


“I don’t care.”


Kimiko sighs. “I know.” Victoria reaches into the pocket of her black skinny jeans and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. She takes one of the white sticks and rests it in her mouth. She lights the tip and breaths in. “I wish you wouldn’t smoke. I hate that habit.”


“What the hell are you saying? Aren’t you aware that basically all your friends at the party you want to go to smoke weed.”


“Oh,” she adjusts her bra strap through her long-sleeved, pink, Abercrombie shirt and runs her fingers through her long, golden hair, “I never thought of that.”


“Oh, what a surprise.” Kimiko looks down at the ground and kicks a rock. Victoria notices the change in mood. “I-I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.” She throws the cigarette on the dirt next to the car. “Come on, sit next to me,” Victoria pats the metal hood to the left of her.


Kimiko smiles and sits next to Victoria. “You like my skirt?” she straightens out her light blue mini-skirt.


“Surprisingly, yes. On anyone else, it would look horrible. You just make everything look good.” She straightens out her Johnny The Homicidal Maniac t-shirt.


“You look good, too.”


“You’re just saying that.” She scratches her head.


“I’m not. You don’t really like compliments, so I would only say it if I really meant it.”


“Heh. Thanks.” She puts her arm around Kimiko and they stare into the sky. “I love this spot. What about you, Kimi?”


“It’s good.”


“Good? Just good? This spots amazing, especially at night. Where the sky is bright with the stars and moon and we get to look down on the lights of the pathetic little city below.”


“I’ve never viewed it that way.”


“Yeah. No one’s seen it that way, especially your friends.”


“Why do you hate them so much?”


“They’ve treated me horrible since I’ve known them.”


“I apologize for them.”


“I wish that meant something.”


Kimiko leans over and kisses Victoria on the lips. “I love you.”


“I love you, too.”


“Why do you love me? You hate my friends, my cloths, the fact that I’m a cheerleader, and just basically everything I represent. So, why do you love me?”


“I don’t know. When I found out there was another lesbian in this town, I had to meet her. At first I really hated you just because of what you described. But, I kept talking to you and realized you were better than I thought and I really liked you. I’m really happy you aren’t like everyone else. On that note, why do you like me?”


“You’re really cute and you’re really nice. Like, you don’t look like you’d be nice. But, you’re amazingly sweet. It was really surprising. No offense.”


“Heh. None taken.” Victoria hugs Kimiko and holds her in her arms. “I really love you, Kimi.”


“I love you, too.”


A couple minutes of silence later, Victoria pats Kimiko on the back. “Come on, lets go.” She hops off the hood of the car.


“What?” She follows.


“It’s getting late. We should get going.”


“Where are we going? To your place?”


“Nah. You wanted to go to that party right? We’ll just go there. You’d be happy to see your friends.” She sits in the drivers seat.


“But, you’d be miserable.” She opens the car door and gets in.


“But, you’d be happy. And, that means more to me.” She turns the key and starts the car.


“I’d rather go to your house. I’d have more fun there.” She fastens her seatbelt.


“Alright. Let’s go there.”


They drive back
