Disneyland for little D is a mixed bag. He loves the rides but some of it can be a bit overwhelming. From the 6 hour drive to his problems adapting to his new bed, it is a mixed bag for my little one. Overall he had loads of fun though, and we came through another good experience together as a family. If you do decide to try doing this. Here are some tips I think you will find useful (I guess these probably work for any multi-day amusement park outing): * Before you go, think about how your kid is going to sleep. Something that has worked for us is to bring his bedroom fan and the bedding from his bed (his own pillowcase, etc). * Bring his diagnosis with you and stop by Guest Services to get a special needs pass, particularly if your little one has trouble with large crowds of people or standing in lines for a long time. This is a must and boon for the whole family - it makes the park a completely different experience for everyone, and it can help family interactions since it instantly makes him very popular amongst siblings (since he has the pass and can skip lines with his party). * Think about the sensory conditions of the place vis-a-vis your kid. If sensitivity to sound is a problem, lights, proprioceptive input etcetera, and try to match his/her temperament with the conditions of the ride. If your kid has never gone into any rides before, you may want to take him on something that is outdoors and low-key first (this type of ride can also help to relax him afterwards). For example, a favorite “relaxing” ride of my son is Heimlich's Chew Chew train on California Adventure, which is the Bugs Life character made into a train and goes outdoors inside a giant collection of food - the odors of the different foods (watermelon, animal crackers) permeate the air as the train goes. * Keep close guard on him if he's a runner. A crowded mega-park is not the place you want to lose track of your kid, particularly if he's nonverbal. Consider using tags or something else with your cell phone on it. If you don't have anything, even black marker on his or her belly (“If lost call (999) 999-9999”) is better than nothing. * Consider your kids' limited diet. You can bring food into Disneyland. * Find quiet areas of the park as you walk and pick those places to take a break. Take out the food at those times. Also keep track of the nearest bathroom. * Something I noticed and I wished I had done was have lunch in the Tiki Room. Little D loved the room, it relaxes him to watch the birds and hear the music and once even fell asleep inside. You are allowed to eat in there as long as you pick up after yourself, which is great to keep fidgetiness to a minimum. Because there really is no bad seat you can stay outside away from the crowd until the appropriate time comes (you may want to let the attendant know how many are in your party and that you will be doing this) and then just show up. Or if your kid will allow it, enjoy the mini-show in the courtyard. * Take some video, but not too much that you don't interact with your kid. Your kid smiling and his eye contact will be priceless to remember.
