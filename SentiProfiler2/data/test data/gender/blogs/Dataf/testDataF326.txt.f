I married my best friend on Aug. 15 and I've truly never been happier. He is a beautiful person and I'm blessed to have found him. He does have one minor, itsy bitsy, flaw though -- he's a diehard Yankees fan. Ah well, no one's perfect. I've chosen to overlook this because he just makes me so damn happy. I know what your next question will be. I can hear you think it. "What if the Yankees play the Dodgers in the World Series?" you ask. I have no freaking clue. I may have to move back in with my parents for a while. Just writing that last sentence made me giggle. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. Please accept my apologies for not updating my blog in a while. Between my wedding, honeymoon and being in preproduction for "Romantically Challenged", I have had my hands full of excitement. Oh wait, did I tell you that "Romantically Challenged", was picked up for midseason? It was! This has been an overwhelming year. I am blessed. If you are going to be in the Chicago area on September 11th, please come see me here: FansEdge Store (at The Shops at Northbridge) 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. CT 55 E. Grand Avenue Now a question for all of you Dodger fans: What are your thoughts on getting Padilla, Sherrill, Belliard, Thome and Garland? Please leave your thoughts for me. For me, I think Ned Colletti has done a solid job of adding the depth. My concern (and if you remember, I've voiced this concern since the offseason) is that we won't get very far in the postseason without an ace to set the tone. Peace, Love, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa
