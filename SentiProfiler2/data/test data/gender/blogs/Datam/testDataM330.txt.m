With the release of a trove of candid and even cringe-worthy emails and documents, Viacom on Thursday claimed that YouTube knew full well that much of its content violated copyright but instead turned the other way, seeking to boost traffic on its site and the value of its company.

But in defending itself in Viacom's $1 billion federal copyright infringement suit, YouTube countered that Viacom sought to benefit from the user-upload site's promotional value, posting its own clips on the site even as it complained of pirated material.

And in some cases, YouTube says, Viacom's marketers secretly deployed third parties to post videos from Paramount and other subsidiaries in an effort to make it look as if its content was gaining grassroots popularity. Moreover, YouTube points to documents that showed that Viacom wanted to buy YouTube or to enter into a content partnership, only to file suit when no agreement was struck. Google bought the company for almost $1.8 billion in 2006.

Undoubtedly, both sides would have preferred to keep some of this material private. However, when both sides filed for summary judgment, U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ordered that the documents had to be released, as they would be cited in the filings.

Viacom's suit, filed in 2007 in a New York federal court, highlights the extent to which, just a few years ago, old media grappled with how to embrace new media and at the same time ensure that its content could be protected.

The heat on YouTube, however, has diminished in recent years as the site has deployed more sophisticated technology to identify copyright abuses.

In seeking damages from YouTube, Viacom is attempting to show how its founders, almost from it start in 2005, recognized the potential liability for posting pirated content yet largely disregarded those concerns, knowing that the site depended on premium videos -- as opposed to the homegrown content featuring favorite pets or curious stunts -- for traffic.

In a March 5 motion for partial summary judgment, Viacom said the YouTube founders saw that its success hinged on building a business "based on piracy," and that they "cast a blind eye to and did not block the huge number of unauthorized copyrighted works posted on the site."

Moreover, they say Google was aware of the perils of featuring pirated content on its own video site before it bought YouTube, but "abandoned its scruples in order to continue growing the YouTube user base until well into 2008." It also said YouTube had its own fingerprinting and filtering technologies to block pirated works, but "engaged in a form of high tech extortion" by refusing to apply the technology to protect Viacom content unless Viacom first agreed to license its clips to the site. "If you were not willing to give them your content for nothing, they were going to keep stealing," Michael Fricklas, Viacom's executive vice president and general counsel, told Daily Variety on Thursday.

Viacom points to a wealth of emails it says shows that YouTube's founders were aware of the "knowledge of and intent to benefit from massive copyright infringement on YouTube."

In a July 29, 2005, email about competing video websites, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote to co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, "steal it!" Hurley responded: "hmm, steal the movies?" Chen replied: "we have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic. how much traffic will we get from personal videos? remember, the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type. . . .viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos."
