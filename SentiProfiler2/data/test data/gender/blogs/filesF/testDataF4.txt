My favourite olympians are speed skaters Catriona Lemay Doan and Susan Auch. Actually I love our whole women's speed skating team to pieces! These women inspired me so much at the Nagano olympics that I started speed skating soon after. Susan Auch also has asthma. Oh yes, and all of Canada is pretty enamoured with mogul skier Alexandre Bilodeau at the moment. He and his brother, who has CP, seem to totally feed off each other for inspiration, I love it! I have more, and frankly they're all fantastic but Catriona and Susan are my top! PS Kyra and Amy, a couple of my fave American bloggers have expressed their total bewilderment at the sport of curling. Yes, it's totally a weird sport but in Canada it's one of those weird-but-normal things. I had no idea it was such a thing. How's Miss Sidekick's project coming?
It's been a busy time -- we just returned from Florida, and I'm headed to Atlanta for a few days and then off to DC to the Political Action Summit the Alzheimer's Association is having. I'm doing it pretty much alone (traveling alone) but since my wonderful son in Washington DC I know he will look out for me. I need to remember to pace myself though as I get so tired so quickly. I'm anxious to get to DC to see many of my Alzheimer's friends -- I "talk" to them a lot over email but it will be nice to see everyone and see how they are doing. And, the staff is so great and accommodating that it will be nice to see them as well. Our state delegation will be heading to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to see our legislators and to ask for more money for research. There is so much more to be done. I'll try to post while I'm away.
I feel so ignorant about nutrition. My formal education about nutrition began and ended studying the food pyramid in 8th grade. I guess it's just assumed that after minimal instruction, school children know everything about food, what to eat and how to make it. My informal education began much earlier: being bombarded with commercials from food companies and fast food vendors side-by-side with diet fads and obesity in the popular media. My readers (you!) really ask some terrific questions that I don't have the answers to (thankfully lots of other commenters do). But it bothers me that I can't answer these basic questions about nutrition (and school lunches) so I'm taking a crash course: I checked out a bunch of interesting books at the library. Here's what I'm going to attempt to read over the next couple months (in my spare time):
You are a special breed of mom. You were hand-selected to parent a most fascinating and positively wonderful child. Your child may be trying at times, but they are remarkable in spite of it. Your child may require extra attention, extra study, extra love, but you have all of that to give and more. You are a special breed of mom because you were chosen to parent a special child, an ADHD child. You are a supermom because you are right here reading this, spending time looking for answers for your ADHD child and sharing a bit of yourself to help others. I applaud you. Keep your chin up and know that you were meant for this extraordinary job and you absolutely have the strength to give your unique child what they need -- love. Lots of love. This, my friends, is a standing ovation in your honor.
I haven't been keeping up with the blog very well. I've been spending much less time on the computer than I used to but thought I could update real quick. Adrian's IEP meeting is this coming Friday. I'm always nervous for these and generally have a very “emotional” week during his IEP meeting weeks. We'll see, last year it went very smoothly. School is going great, his teacher is amazing. I really wasn't sure at the beginning of the year but he's made more progress these last few months than he has ever made. He's chugging right along, he can read some simple sentences, he can say anything that we ask him to say but spontaneous conversation isn't there yet, he can write his name. His stimming is still wildly out of control and he can't sit still. His teacher had me fill out a paper for the Conner's scale to see about possible ADHD. We've always thought he may have ADHD as well and we have talked to a developmental pediatrician about that and he had told us they don't like to diagnose ADHD until at least first grade. It seems like the teacher is really hoping we can talk to his doctor about this possibility and see if there is anything we need to do to help him in this area. We're going to talk about this more at the IEP and we'll probably be scheduling a visit to the doctor and possibly the Iowa State University hospital to look into this more if we need to. The girls are good. I took Nevaeh to the art center the other day and she loved it. Her favorite thing by far was painting. She also made a necklace and played in shaving cream. There was a lady sitting in there playing a keyboard for the kids and she was holding a cute fuzzball of a dog. Nevaeh loved that. Usually Nevaeh is scared of dogs but this one was so tiny and quiet so Nevaeh was actually petting it which surprised me. Sanura got her report card. She's doing very very well. Her teacher made a note that Sanura was doing better socially but needed to “use her time wisely” Sanura wasn't sure what she meant by that so we talked it over and hopefully she understands that she needs to be staying on task. The only part I saw that was concerning was Sanura's subtraction facts…I guess she's having trouble with that so we'll be practicing that at home. Sanura always gets very good marks in music. She loves to sing and she's good at it too. I'm trying to come up with a way to help her expand on that and practice that more since it's something she seems to enjoy so much and something that she's good at. Mister Lincoln got another hair cut today. He was so good, barely moved throughout the whole thing. He's talking more and more. He's even saying a few sentences now, the other day he actually told me “Open the door!” I was kind of surprised by that one!
I enjoy reading everyone's comments so much. You educate me about school lunches because many of you know much more than I do. You share personal experiences that inspire me to continue. You encourage me. Thank you! It seems like there needs to be an outlet for you to share your thoughts with the small "community" of blog readers. I'm going to open a thread for you to share something with the readers. If you have a question for me, please continue to email me directly, but if you have a question for the readers, put it here. I moderate comments older than 3-4 days and I am proud to say I have only had to delete one (it was spam). I'm not afraid of negative commentary, but please don't be hateful. Great discussions include opinions from all. If the open thread is popular, in the future I'll give you a specific topic to discuss. But for the first open thread, you can decide what to chat about. Happy weekend!
We had our meeting at school on Friday to discuss some ideas that I could use at home to encourage communication. I did get some good ideas. One of them is having a picture of each person in the family and showing Adrian the pictures and telling him for example, “Go say ‘Hi’ to Nevaeh” and Adrian is supposed to go over to Nevaeh and say “Hi Nevaeh”….he’s doing this at school. It’s harder to accomplish at home, I think I need to bribe him with Skittles like his teacher does at school! LOL We WILL get the hang of this! He’s doing it great at school so I know he’s capable.
Call me crazy, but I'm not worried about my health. The other meals I eat during the average day are healthy. I have the money to make good meals for my family that are from fresh and frozen ingredients, many organic. So I actually think it's funny that people are concerned about me. Thank you, I'm doing fine (and it's only day 10). Also I really don't have lofty goals for my cash-strapped district's limited resources. I simply want school administration to be more reflective about what they are serving the children they don't want to fall "behind" (NCLB inside joke). I mean, would it hurt the district's meal planners to offer the occasional yogurt to the kids? I want less pre-fab food and higher quality options. Less crap, you know?
My husband enjoys watching old government films for laughs. He's the kinda guy that trolls the Prelinger Archives for old gems (like "How to keep a job" -1949). Most of the films are pretty campy. Anyway, he told me about a government film about school lunch made in 1966 entitled "It happens every noon." There are so many things wrong about this film (too many to list) so please do not think I endorse anything related to this movie in terms of subject matter. That aside it did gave me some insight into the beginnings of National School Lunch program and what students ate in the 1960's. Sadly it looks like school lunches have gone downhill in the past 40 years.
Sometimes real life has a way of interfering with life on the internet. There's been a lot of that going around lately. And sometimes it seems as if there is nothing much to say. And there's been a lot of that lately too. I'm hoping that, on the other side of all this stuff going on, that maybe I'll have a whole slew of posts about how, yes, His grip on me really was way, way stronger and more sure than my grip on Him. And maybe I'll even be able to share a little bit of what that looked like.
Speaking of diagnosing autism: it seems not just every state, but every country, city, town, hamlet or nation has their own criteria for diagnosing autism. The definition is so blown out of porportion autism label is becoming a total sham. Well, not total. There are really people with autism from severe to higher functioning, but one thing is for sure: there is an epidemic of overdiagnosing people with autism. I just saw a video on YOU TUBE titled: autism spectrum seems out of control. Watch it: it makes you think also go to you tube and type in autism self injury if your child is suffering from this type of behavior…also, make sure your child is tested for things like Fragile X, Celiac Disease and other things before your doctor slaps the autism label on your child! Lastly, do NOT let your school diagnose your child, they aren't qualified. Nor is the average pediatrician or even neurologist half the time. Then again, some people are so over enthusiatic to diagnose autism, even the people that should know better are screwing up. You can't diagnose a kid after a 20 minute office rooom observation. A good doctor rules out other conditions that could be causing regression or autistic like features and tendencies. Unfortunately, that's not being done these days. Kids are being diagnosed with aspergers and autism after 15 minute doctor visits. Docs aren't even asking historical background or running genetic tests or blood tests , allergy tests, urine tests, cat scans, etc…to check out if something else is going on….
 Today's lunch: Spaghetti with meat sauce, green beans, a breadstick, chocolate milk, and a blue-raspberry icee thing. As far as school lunches go, this one is pretty good. The meat sauce over penne was passable and the green beans were ok too. I ate all of main stuff, but I only took one bite of the breadstick, which was too chewy yet semi-hard, and the blue raspberry thingy....I took one suck and knew it was not for me. Of course I drank all the chocolate milk. School lunch at my school/workplace always comes in these strange little packages. I have to say that it is very hard to open them. I have to stab them with the spork multiple times. The only reason I mention that is that if you have fine motor issues, it would take you awhile to get everything open. The kids get 20 minutes to eat including getting through line and clean up. The school feeds many hundreds of students. There are multiple lunch periods. The lunch ladies are friendly and hard-working. It's a very busy cafeteria.
In our culture, we often get criticized for making assumptions based on people's appearances. To some extent, it can be wrong, judgmental, and prejudicial. But, in other cases, we do it all the time. One of my sons, for example, is a very hard worker. It is obvious to almost everyone who meets him. His body is that of a man well experienced with good, old-fashioned, masculine labor. No one with a lick of sense could look at him and wrongly assume him to be some sort of typical teenager huddled in his room playing video games all day. In fact, people who meet him often ask me, "What kind of work does he do?" and then they nod, with an "Of course!" when they hear my answer. I teach martial arts. When people walk into the dojo, I'm usually not surprised to discover, once they join our class, how well they can or can't handle the physical effort required, or how willing they are to work hard. Hard work and exercise has an entirely different impact on our bodies --- and their appearance --- than does a soft, easy lifestyle involving minimal effort. As one of my students asked me early on, "If I was already working hard, do you think I would look like this?" One of the things I like about what I do is that I get to see formerly self-described lazy people "get off their duff" and leave their sedentary ways behind. Although I don't stress nutrition as much as I probably should, it's always rewarding to see my students realize that, if they are going to work hard, they need to start giving their bodies healthier "fuel".
Whenever the topic of weight loss or gluttony or obesity or related issues comes up, it seems that there is always someone, or several someones, in the group who try to derail the conversation from being about healthy living, the benefits of exercise, the obesity health crisis, the sin of gluttony, or whatever, and turn it into an excuse as to why we should not be concerned with any of those matters. Here are some typical misinformed statements that I've grown weary of hearing trotted out again and again. I've worded them a bit more dramatically and amusingly than they usually are, just to keep the boredom at bay. 1. People are getting thinner and thinner and it's unhealthy! People have no idea what a real woman or real man is supposed to look like! Sorry, but no. Read this. It turns out the exact opposite is true. Yes, Americans are getting taller, but their weight gain is way out of proportion. Quite alarming. 2. Marilyn Monroe, that epitome of female beauty and all that is feminine and wonderful, that woman who should be every woman's role model, would be considered fat by today's ridiculous standards. Why, she wore a dress size 16! We know she was 5' 5 1/2" tall and that her weight ranged from 118 - 140. Hardly fat by today's standards. In 2002, the average American woman was 5' 4" and weighed 164.3 pounds, which makes Marilyn Monroe quite slender, if not downright skinny, in comparison. As for the dress size myth, read this. 3. It only takes a few more calories over the course of a person's lifetime to make him obese. Why, all he needs to do is eat two bites of a sandwich more than some skinny guy. That's hardly gluttony. Usually there is some goofy math involved here, like the one guy whose arithmetic assumed a man was born at his full adult weight and then gained only 50 pounds over his 50 years of life. Yeah, right. The sad truth is that gluttons often have no idea how much they really eat, or how horribly much more food that is than normal, healthy people eat, or how horribly much more food it is than they really need. I know...from sad personal experience. 4. Just because I don't want to control my eating and don't want to exercise and don't want to do anything to improve my health doesn't mean I'm lazy! You have no idea how busy I am! To that, I have three replies, in the form of anecdotes...
My husband and I went to excellent elementary and secondary schools and then we graduated from college. Although we both have had no formal education or training in nutrition, we have a basic grasp of healthy food and how to nourish our bodies and those of our littlest family member too. We would be considered "middle class" by most Americans, but if you compare us to the rest of the world, we are in the top 3-5% of income worldwide and our standard of living is high (we have all basic necessities met as well as lots of fun extras). Consider that half of the world's population subsists on less than $1 per day and you get really happy about your life if you live in America. Through my "middle class" eyes, some of the meals offered to the children at my school make me wonder, but then again I have no training in nutrition (just an interest). All I can say is that I wouldn't want my toddler eating the school lunches. Lucky for us because of our socio-economic status we can make sure that our little one gets the best possible food either at the best possible school or through meals we pack for him at home. Some have asked what the kids think of the meals. Well, they always try to say something positive about the food. I hear "good" or "great." I'm thinking that if they didn't like it, they just don't answer. Overall, none of the kids want to sit around and discuss their lunches. I don't pry because I know that for some, the school lunch is their best (or only) meal of the day. What do they know about food? Can they have an opinion if they can't compare the meal to anything? For example, at different times over this past weekend I prepared catfish, edamame, swiss chard, rice, rolls, avocado, eggs, sausage, and bacon for my family for various meals. Socio-economic status makes it hard for these kids to experience food in the way that "rich" people like us get to. So when these students are given food, they just say "thank you."
A couple weeks ago Jason Croft of Sidetrack contacted me and requested an interview. I decided to do it. You can find the podcast of my interview with him here: http://will.illinois.edu/sidetrack February 2010 Before you click: * The interview starts around minute 5:00 and lasts about 10 minutes. * I was very nervous and so I stumble a lot! I am not a professional speaker and the project had only just begun. * When we chatted, I said my least favorite meal was pizza or hot dogs... But by that early point in the project I had yet to eat the PB&J, which is unequivocally the worst so far. * You can hear my toddler very, very faintly in the background off and on after minute 12:20. I was so focused on chatting that I didn't realize it.
I worry about memories -- I know they are going to become more distant to me. I was thinking about this over the weekend -- we were telling Alan and Jennifer what we used to do before they were born -- i.e. make pizza dough from scratch, not use shortcuts while preparing dinner, etc. But, today, I was cleaning out some things from Alan's bedroom and I ran across something Alan did in the 6th grade -- it is his "autobiography". You can just imagine if he did it in the sixth grade how interesting it is!!! I had to take time out of cleaning and sit down and read it. I laughed....I cried.....I realized how much I didn't remember......I understood how important some little things we used to do were to Alan.....and I actually saw a glimpse of the man he is today. I'll keep this forever -- what a treat to find.
Today's menu: Hamburger, wheat buns, tator tots, fruit jello, chocolate milk. I ate everything. The patty was how do you say nothing like any hamburger I have ever eaten. Mystery meat in every sense. I also really wanted more than just six tator tots. The fruit cup was NOT FROZEN, so I ate it. I also drank the chocolate milk, which was ok. I normally don't drink milk at lunch. So now that I've added a lunchtime milk, I've noticed some interesting changes. I'm getting a little lactose-intolerant in my old age. This lunch was better than other lunches in that there was more protein and I wasn't as desperately hungry after school like I have been in the past. But overall it still isn't enough for the kids who eat this one meal at school and that's it for the whole day. There is significant poverty at my school and some of the kids are very thin (and others are very, very chunky). No matter what size you are you should be able to eat healthy at school.
I am a mother of a daughter with SID my husband also has suffered with severe ADD his entire life. Many people have told me my daughter probably has ADD as well. Its not that we dont want to have a doctor diagnose our daughter with ADD we just dont want the medications that go with it, in many cases parents are forced to give there children. But, since my daughter has been working with an OT she has truly showed quite the improvement. Her attention span has increased, her speach, her activity leavel is much closer the average child than before, and even her memory and interaction with people has improved. Even my husband has tried some strategies suggested by the OT and has felt better in his own body since doing so. He to has seriouse sensory issues though he is not diagnosed with SID he exibits many of the same sensory quarks my daughter does. As a mother and a wife I have seen great strides in both my daughter and husband with simple OT and no medication. I can first handedly see the link between ADD and SID.
Hi there, I'm 18 years old and when I was 15 I finally had surgery on my problem. Like you I had been through various procedures, none of which aleviated the pain. It made eating such an issue for me, especially as I suffered from it through most of my childhood. Although suffering with it at any age is horrible. I had keyhole surgery, after suggesting it could be Achalasia and the surgery has saved my life literally. I had lost so much weight, and I had had balloon dilation, endoscopys and other unpleasant procedures. I can't stress enough how important it is to suggest this to your doctors. I can now eat and drink with no problems, a fact that I am eternally grateful for. Good Luck.
Even though, in most cases, obesity can be prevented or reversed by healthy eating and by exercise or physical work, I think it is wrong to assume, just by looking at an obese person, that he is a lazy glutton, given to excess eating and inactivity. If we don't know this person, we will most likely be entirely right about what made him obese in the first place, but we shouldn't assume that he has not already repented from this lifestyle. For example, take the picture that started the obesity discussion on the Bayly Blog. It's impossible to ignore that the man on the right is quite obese and seems pleased, even proud of the fact. He seems delighted to point out his resemblance to a pregnant woman. His condition --- which would be alarming if we had not already become so used to seeing obese men in our culture --- has gone way beyond a "few extra pounds" or a "little flab around the middle" that we might be able to blame on stress or joyous feasting with family over the holidays. His situation, like that of way too many others, is far more grave and serious than that. However, it is wrong, if we don't know this man and his history, to assume that he is currently still overeating and not exercising and/or working enough. When we see people in his condition, we don't always know what they were like some months back. For instance, I recently met a woman who is obese but who is also, at least for the past six months or so, one of the hardest working, most sensible eaters I've ever met. No one would guess it to look at her --- unless they had seen what she looked like six months ago.
It was suggested by a close friend that I add Google AdSense to the blog and then donate the proceeds to a Farm to School initiative or another group. I'm getting enough traffic here that I could raise a couple hundred dollars per month just based upon people landing on the site (clicking not required). Although I like the idea of donating to a worthy cause, I don't feel comfortable adding ads to the blog. To me having ads undermines the whole point of what I'm doing as an individual to raise awareness. On the other hand, giving money to something that does agree with the tenets of the blog is appealing. But then who would I choose and should I rotate on a monthly basis to various agencies.... I'd like to have a "show of hands" of my readership so I'm going to add a poll to the right-hand side of the blog. You are welcome to comment as well.
Today is the 5th anniversary of my brother Sam's death. This blog entry was slightly modified from something I wrote soon after losing him. What do you say about someone you could never have imagined living without? Sam was always there, since my earliest memories. He was more than a big brother; he was one of the biggest influences in my life. Sam was my teacher. He helped teach me to read, taught me to play with Legos, taught me to fish, to ride a bike, to climb trees, to cook creatively and adventurously, to do all sorts of fun and wonderful things. But he taught me so much more---to enjoy reading, and to have a bizarre sense of humor, and to be who I am today. Sam was my protector. and defender. He fought off bullies and, when they got to me before he could stop them, Sam was quick to execute justice on my behalf. I always felt safe with Sam. He wasn't just my bodyguard; he protected me emotionally as well. He was all a big brother should be. Sam was my hero. As a little sister, I thought he was simply amazing---brilliant and capable and strong and brave. I still think that, especially after watching him fight his own personal “Battle of Helm's Deep”---his courageous struggle to conquer his insidious cancer. Sam was my friend. Not just a friend, not just a good friend---for many years, he was my best friend, the one who knew all my childish secrets, the one I could depend on without fail. As children, we were so inseparable and so bonded that we even invented our own language. As adults, we shared an apartment and enjoyed each other's company so much that people sometimes thought we were a married couple. Sam brought a tremendous amount of joy to my life. He could make me laugh like no one else could. I could talk for days---no, for the rest of my life---about all the fun adventures we had over the years. In our adult life, Sam and his wonderful wife Joan gave me the great joy of being an aunt to three of the most terrific, beautiful children in the world: Brendan, Emily, and Quentin. Sam also, to be honest, broke my heart. The first time was when I was three years old, and he refused my proposal of marriage. Everyone who knows Sam knows he wasn't perfect. I don't think Sam ever intended to hurt me in any way, but when you really love someone, heartbreak is unavoidable. And now...while my heart is still seemingly broken beyond repair at losing my wonderful older brother five years ago, I know that in the end, God will wipe away every tear from our eyes, and we will be together forever in a glorious place where there is no more sorrow, no more cancer, no more goodbyes, no more grief, and no more death. See you forever, Sam. Thank you for being such a wonderful big brother. I'll never forget.
I spoke last night to a really nice group of women at the local Pilot Club. The work with a program called Project Lifesaver International. Project Lifesaver International helps provide rapid response to save lives and reduce potential for serious injury for adults and children who wander due to Alzheimer's, Autism, Down Syndrome, dementia and other related disorders. For more information you can go to www.projectlifesaver.org. This program is provided nationwide. I'd like to thank the ladies there for welcoming me to their meeting last night. In a few weeks I'll be going to Washington DC for the Alzheimer's Action Summit Advocacy Forum. If any of you that read this blog are going, please let me know as I would love to meet you. The conference is designed for advocates across the nation to meet with their national legislators. For more information you can go to www.alz.org/summit/forum_about.asp
Yesterday, May 6, 2009, I went to bed elated by the news that the Dodgers made history. Just 10 hours later, I woke up disheartened by the news that Manny Ramirez was suspended for 50 games due to testing positive for an MLB banned substance. I then proceeded to comfort eat. I ate two muffins with a side of frosted flakes. I now feel puffy. ESPN is reporting that they have received information from two sources that the banned substance Manny tested positive for is human chorionic gonadotropin. HCG is a fertility drug typically used by steroid users coming off the juice that aids in replenishing testosterone levels in the testicles. As we've all learned by now, testosterone is depleted by steroid use, and low testosterone can cause erectile dysfunction. (Insert inappropriate Mannywood joke here). But it should be noted that HCG can also be used in lieu of steroids because of its testosterone boosting effect which can boost performance. Still bad. In his statement, Ramirez said: "I want to apologize to Mr. McCourt, Mrs. McCourt, Mr. Torre, my teammates, the Dodger organization, and to the Dodger fans. LA is a special place to me, and I know everybody is disappointed. So am I. I'm sorry about this whole situation." And if it isn't bad enough for baseball, Tom Verducci from SI.com closed his article with this staggering fact: "Ramirez ranks 17th on the all-time home-run list with 533. Eight of those top 17 home run hitters played in what is commonly referred to as the Steroid Era. And six of those eight modern-day sluggers have been associated with performance-enhancing drugs: Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Rodriguez and Ramirez. The only modern sluggers to have escaped such a connection are Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas and Jim Thome." Am I enraged? No. Cheating in baseball has been around for as long as the sport has been around. This latest form of cheating is a direct result of where we are socially. I've said it many times before but it is worth repeating here and now. We're all looking for a quick fix to be stronger, to look younger, to perform better and to cure what ails us. Performance enhancing drugs are, unfortunately, the evolution of cheating that mirrors the evolution of the pharmaceutical society that we've become. So, no, I am not enraged. I'm just sad and disappointed. Below is an excerpt from my book Safe at Home: Confessions of a Baseball Fanatic. This excerpt appears in the chapter entitled, "Cheating Through The Ages," and I thought it was appropriate to post today. Please leave your comments. I always enjoy reading them. "Okay, I'm just gonna lay this out here: Cheating in baseball has been around for a long time. Pretty much since the game began there have been stolen signs, spitballs, corked bats, greenies, and any number of other methods to get ahead. It was only after all that when the current era of swollen necks and bulging home run totals was ushered in. So much for baseball's innocence. The difference between the past and the present is that today's cheating is happening off the field. It's happening in locker rooms and bathroom stalls instead of on the basepaths and the pitcher's mound. Personally, I can't figure out how anyone can say that one form of cheating is "better" than another. Can't we just say that they're all bad rather than trying to find ways to show that the past was full of decency and the present is full of deception? I'm a big believer in individual responsibility. Baseball cheaters should be punished. Punished, yes, but not destroyed. It was true when Shoeless Joe Jackson and the rest of the Black Sox disappointed a nation, and it's true now, for the guys looking for an edge by using the needle. The real problem with steroids is that the baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, and the Major League Baseball Players Association didn't nip it in the bud (no pun intended) early on. For years both sides opposed testing with little sense of the toll that this position would take on the game. Their negligence turned a problem into an epidemic, leaving an entire era of stats in question. Home runs, hits, and attendance were up, and that meant more money for teams and the league, which meant more money for players, which meant more money for the union. Take all those financial incentives together, and suddenly no one is in a hurry to regulate anything. Yet even though there are a lot of people responsible for the steroid era there are very few who've actually stepped up and admitted their part in it. And that's what I have a problem with. Barry Bonds is undoubtedly one of the greatest players ever. You know what? I didn't have as much of a problem with the idea of him cheating as I did with the possibility that he lied about it. In contrast, there are guys like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte, who simply came clean (inasmuch as Giambi could without violating the terms of his contract). And I totally respect their honesty. Yes, Giambi may have made some bad choices throughout his career, but I must admit, as a purist fan of baseball, I had a newfound respect for the man after he told the truth. I have compassion for anyone trying to do the right thing, anyone who may have had a slip of judgment and then recognized his or her mistakes. Maybe my biggest frustration with this issue is that Major League Baseball and the players union have yet to own up to their role in all this. A grand jury, a congressional committee, a tell-all book, and they have yet to apologize for their complacency. Before MLB can solve this issue it needs to recognize the problem and apologize for it. If any employee of any major entertainment corporation were to act inappropriately and offend or alienate his or her audience, the CEO would apologize on behalf of the company. Why is it so hard for Bud Selig to say, "I apologize for the steroid era. We made a mistake with our complacency, and we are taking the appropriate measures to make sure the future game of baseball is played with dignity and integrity." The fans, the players, the coaches -- everyone needs to close the book on this latest chapter, in the game's cheating history. As the latest in a long history of cheating episodes, it's our obligation to give it the attention it deserves and then move on. We owe it to ourselves and... we owe it to the game." Peace, Love, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa
I have a child who is thirteen who has sensory intergration disorder and nnon verbal learnign disorder one of the most difficulty I am having istelling when she is sick. For example recently she got a double ear infection. I did not know until she had a 101 fever and was vomitting. she also does not relize when she is hurt. I have had to home school her because she is considered difficult to teach. Some teachers ask if I have had her tested for adhd and if so why have I not giving her medication. I provide documents on her condition and it does not seem to help.
I married my best friend on Aug. 15 and I've truly never been happier. He is a beautiful person and I'm blessed to have found him. He does have one minor, itsy bitsy, flaw though -- he's a diehard Yankees fan. Ah well, no one's perfect. I've chosen to overlook this because he just makes me so damn happy. I know what your next question will be. I can hear you think it. "What if the Yankees play the Dodgers in the World Series?" you ask. I have no freaking clue. I may have to move back in with my parents for a while. Just writing that last sentence made me giggle. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. Please accept my apologies for not updating my blog in a while. Between my wedding, honeymoon and being in preproduction for "Romantically Challenged", I have had my hands full of excitement. Oh wait, did I tell you that "Romantically Challenged", was picked up for midseason? It was! This has been an overwhelming year. I am blessed. If you are going to be in the Chicago area on September 11th, please come see me here: FansEdge Store (at The Shops at Northbridge) 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. CT 55 E. Grand Avenue Now a question for all of you Dodger fans: What are your thoughts on getting Padilla, Sherrill, Belliard, Thome and Garland? Please leave your thoughts for me. For me, I think Ned Colletti has done a solid job of adding the depth. My concern (and if you remember, I've voiced this concern since the offseason) is that we won't get very far in the postseason without an ace to set the tone. Peace, Love, AND BASEBALL, Alyssa
What did I learn during my time in "recovery"? * I like to thoroughly examine both sides of a story before making my own judgement. I know what Ana Bella is going through, why she thinks the way she does. I know what Mia Jessica's distorted reflection looks like in her eyes. Those connections make us kin in a way no other relationship can connect people. * For all their years and years of research and development, doctors, nurses, and therapists will NEVER understand the disordered mind if they have never lived it themselves. It appalls me to hear them say, "I understand what you're telling me..." Nothing infuriates me faster. No amount of study and research will qualify you to "understand" until you've lived through it. * I have a new respect for the self-control of my tongue, as well as self-control of my weight. I can retrain my mind and body to learn to play any game for a little while, tell you what you think you want to hear, show you what you think you want to see, if it gets me to my end. I can make you believe you have "healed" me. And I can be set free. I am free now. I believe I am ready to fly again.
A study published in the December issue of the Annals of Rheumatic Disease describe what many people with who have had RA may already know; that new drugs and more aggressive treatment with these drugs has improved the health status of people with RA over the last 15 years. The Norwegian study surveyed almost 1,000 people with RA four times over a period of 10 years (1994-2004) and found that the health status of these patients consistently improved over that time, in terms of physical health, global health and pain. The believe that the improvement is the result of more aggressive early treatment and better access overall to drugs for patients, as well as closer management of the treatment regime by physicians. Another recent study from Spain also found that the best results come from more effective management of drug treatment, rather than access to new therapies. The team of researchers followed almost 800 patients in Spain from 2000-2004. The study, published online in Arthritis Research and Therapy concluded that while the clinical development of drugs has made great advances, it is the physician's management of the available drugs, old and new, that makes the most difference. The researchers in Spain found that clinical trial results tend to show levels of remission and halts in disease progression that are not enjoyed by patients in real life. The authors stated that this difference could be due to patients included in clinical trials being younger on average, having fewer comorbidities and being selected for trial because they have a higher level of disease activity than real-life patients. The authors found that real-life RA patients (with both severe and mild disease) improved in terms of disease activity, disability and radiological progression independently of the availability of new therapies. The study seemed to conclude that better management by doctors in the future, meaning better selection of patients for early biologic treatment, will improve patients' therapeutic response to treatment, their functional outcomes, and will improve cost-effectiveness of these drugs avoiding unnecessary prescriptions.
Last October, my husband came down with a bad sinus infection that he just couldn't seem to shake. Doctors prescribed antibiotics in increasing strength. We tried to figure out what was going on in my husband's body that had compromised his immune system to such a degree, and that was rendering him weaker and weaker by the days. He was gripped with extreme fatigue and only his willpower, determination, and incredible work ethic enabled him to drag himself to work. Evenings, he would come home and collapse on the couch or in bed. We tried this treatment and that. Sought an assortment of specialists in and out of mainstream medicine. To make a long story short, we now have a diagnosis: panhypopituitarism due to a pituitary adenoma. What this means is that a rather large benign tumor has squished my husband's pituitary gland to the point that it is pretty much failing to function...which means the endocrine system is following suit. On April 9, a skilled neurosurgeon will remove the tumor. We'd like to hope that pituitary function will return, but he has told us that this is not likely. Through this trial, I have grown to respect and admire my husband all the more. We have actually managed, despite his exhaustion and health problems, to enjoy each other's company. In many ways, we are closer than ever. We have even found lots of things to laugh about. Our family has faced another trial as well. As a friend of mine used to say dramtically, "we have been passing through deep waters". We have not quite yet reached the shore. It may take a long, long while. God is faithful. Amazingly so. In extremely tangible and practical ways, as well as in secret ways that only one's heart can know. All that stuff about Jesus never leaving us nor forsaking us, about His being made strong through our weakness, about those who wait upon the Lord renewing their strength? It's all true. More than I could have ever hoped.
I probably could not have taken on this project if I didn't have a nice long summer break in the middle of the year. I'm looking forward to eating lunches I prepare myself. However... I'm thinking about doing some kind of extension of the project over the summer. I am definitely going to do some kind of "cleanse" in June. Nothing crazy, but more of a "30 days of whole foods." It would be fun to travel to a country where school is in session and see what they are eating. That would be hard to swing, but it would be so interesting. Or I could try to make a healthy lunch every day for the cost of a school lunch $2.92 (per the School Nutrition Association). The average school lunch program gets reimbursed at $2.68, leaving a shortfall. I think I could make a healthy lunch for $1.00 per day. Have any ideas for what I should do over the summer? You guys are so creative.
I've been playing around with Twitter quite a bit of late. While it's been fun and all, I have to admit that I was beginning to wonder what the fuss was all about. Then... I discovered that Twitter can be a quick, almost instant, way to track breaking news stories -- both from professional news sources and from eyewitnesses. It's a way to track stories that our US media tends to ignore, such as the alarming persecution against Christians in India, North Korea, Saudia Arabia, and elsewhere. And it's a way to discover what the latest buzz is, whether it's angry Prop 8 protests or some new video game. The local feature makes things interesting. I can read "tweets" from my particular area. I like the idea that the Twitter platform doesn't allow longwindedness but, if you need more than 140 characters to say something, you can link to your blog. That also provides a great way to notify others, and be notified, of blog posts that are hot off the press. Let me know about your Twitter experiences. How do you use it?
According to the calendar, winter is officially upon us. It began last week and will be with us for the next three months – Ugh! The arrival of Ole Man Winter is a bitter/sweet for me; more bitter than sweet. While I appreciate the beauty of a fresh, crisp snowfall, I do not welcome the cold. As I sit here by the fire, typing this blog, the snow is falling outside of my windows. It began a short while ago. The large flakes have already created a white blanket completely covering the ground and the trees are outlined with snow on every branch. It is absolutely gorgeous! It is picture perfect scenery that I will enjoy for about two weeks. Then I want it to be warm again. The winter season confines me and limits my activities more than any other time of the year. It is the season that reminds me of the things I cannot do rather than the things I can do. Arthritis alone limits mobility, making every task a challenge. But when joint replacements, fusions and reconstructed limbs are factored in, the challenges increase. Having limited range of motion, decreased strength and the need for adaptive equipment makes the equation even more complicated. Then add icy, slippery conditions, and the combination becomes high risk.
(TMI alert -- I revealed this in an upcoming interview so that's why I'm posting it a little ahead of time) I haven't told you another thing: Two years ago a gastroenterologist diagnosed me with IBS (he ran lots of tests so no need to suggest additional ones). It certainly wasn't a shock; something was up and my whole family has digestive issues. I control it with my normal diet just fine (avoiding caffeine, excessive fiber, eating fresh food, etc). And then... ....I started this project. I think the processed foods have caused a small increase in digestive issues. Nothing major, but every weekend I eat a plain diet to give my body a break. Keep in mind there is an emotional component of IBS. I'm a little stressed out so that upsets my system sometimes too. That's why it's so hard for me to pinpoint what exactly causes problems. I got a referral to a new gastro and I'm hoping to get some additional answers. I'll keep you guys updated. I'm really doing fine, but I just want to get another opinion.
Welcome to my first blog! Allow me to introduce myself a bit and give you a little information about my background. In the mid-90s, I had just entered MTSU to study English with a minor in secondary education. In one of my first classes, we were required to give little speeches about an educational topic. I chose censorship. Someone else in my class chose ADD/ADHD. I wasn't really listening to her speech. At the time, I thought ADD/ADHD was just some disorder that allowed bad parents to medicate their children into submission. Then the student handed out a list of "ADHD traits." As I started reading them, I was surprised at how many of them fit me. In fact, it was as if someone had handed me a list describing ME! I immediately ran to the bookstore and picked up a copy of Driven to Distraction. At the time, it was one of the few books on Adult ADD/ADHD, even if it was located in the children's reference section. The more I read, the more I was convinced that I might have ADHD and I decided to get a diagnosis. I went to a specialist in Nashville, TN, and got my suspicions confirmed. Since that time, I have spent a good portion educating myself and others about ADHD. After graduating with my Bachelor's Degree, I taught high school English for a year before going back and getting my Master's Degree in Special Education. Most of my research was done on ADD/ADHD. I knew that I was on my way to becoming an expert when one of my special education teachers contacted me to help another student dealing with ADHD. As a special education teacher, I have always found it helpful to share my own insights with my students and parents about being ADHD. I understand it on a different level than most other teachers because I experience it on a day-to-day basis. I also strongly feel that ADHD is a gift. Like any gift, it comes with advantages and disadvantages. ADHD is a part of me and I refuse to accept that any part of me is "bad." Sure, I am not perfect and there are things I could improve, but that doesn't mean I'm planning to change who I am. I have also worked as an ADHD coach and as an advocate for others with ADHD.
Hi. Yes, it's me, the sporadic blogger. I just felt like posting a little update today, partly to get things off my chest I suppose. Things have been, well, y'know, the same. Or worse. I'm not sure. Better actually, because I have been avoiding life like never before. Less anxiety because I haven't been shopping or done any cooking or cleaning or... anything. The cupboards are empty. Mr Man is starving. We've just been living off take-aways. But the counsellor said it's ok to avoid things that cause me anxiety, so that's ok. (?) Well, it did help with my anxiety for a while, but now I realise we have things to pay and I have wasted all our money, so long term it's kind of made things worse. Now I have to go back to managing the anxiety of shopping and cooking with the added anxiety of worrying about money. Some readers suggested ordering shopping online and having it delivered, which was a very good suggestion and I did try, but I had to register and fill in an online form which kind of brought on a panic attack and I haven't tried again since. I feel like a failure. All I can do is apologise to Mr Man over and over again, but it doesn't seem to mean anything. "I'm sorry" doesn't cover it. It doesn't do my feelings justice.
I know I haven't posted in awhile -- hope everyone made it through the holidays o.k. Wanted to bring your attention to a few Alzheimer's related things coming up -- On Tuesday, January 12th the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric will air a 6 minute segment on Alzheimer's entitled "Where American Stands on Alzheimer's". A three generation family will be interviewed with two the generations diagnosed with the disease. I hope you will tune in to watch and let CBS know how much we appreciate them airing it! February 8th is Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Capitol in Atlanta. We need everyone there -- here is a link to the Georgia Chapter's site for more information. Please make plans now to attend.
I logged in to blog just now and it told me my last blog entry was Feb. 11. Terrible. Unacceptable. Gearing up for tour and recording the album, for me, doesn't involve a lot of gearing up at all, really. Brian flies to LA or New York, writes some songs, sends them to us and we write our parts. Lately it's rare that I see the whole band in the same room. When I do see band, we're in Bill's basement and usually there are only a few of us there at a time. I'm starting to feel...normal. I'm 24 living in Chicago, working at an English Pub downtown, just like so many other people. My fiance is on tour with a children's theatre in New York and I've found great homes with friends for my bunnies, so I have our place to myself. I wake up, work out (or teach spinning which I do 2 times a week), shower, put on my blacks, take the train to work, list the soup and sandwich of the day to uncaring diners, take the train home, put on a sweatshirt, eat dinner while I watch Battlestar Galactica (which has become my current obsession...a problem really) and go to bed. That is a typical day for me. Meanwhile, I get text messages from Bill that say we're on scrolling on the top of the homepage of MTVmusic.com (wrong picture too....sucks to be Packy and Chad) or emails from our manager, J.J., about crazy stuff that I'm not at liberty to speak of. It is all completely surreal. I read all of this usually while I'm at work, put my phone back in my apron (DON'T TELL MY MANAGER PLEASE) and then run a fish and chips and club sandwich to table 32. They ask for mayo. I get them their mayo. WHAT?! WHAT IS MY LIFE?! Despite all of the monotony of waking up, going to work, and then coming home, I really hold on to the exciting stuff that's brewing. I've called Brian (who in currently in LA writing) twice now needing to hear updates on things, just to remind myself that I Fight Dragons actually exists and I'm not crazy. I feel crazy. Often. This feeling, I expect, will stick around for quite some time. It will change slightly, but I bet money that in 2 months when we're on tour you'll read a blog from me that will say "There are thousands of people watching our show every night....WHAT IS MY LIFE?!" I'm soaking it up. Loving it? Ehhhh not so much, but I am very aware that I will look back on all of this fish and chips MTV nonsense fondly. Tomorrow I get to see (some) band!! Mike Mentzer, who was our original Green Lantern, is playing a free show at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue tomorrow night (Friday) and a few of us are going. THEN Tally Hall and Jukebox the Ghost at Lincoln Hall with Mr. William Prokopow, and THEN hanging out with our new tour manager/awesome guy Charlie. Really looking forward to that. Well, I'm off to return to my life of normalcy. Tonight's agenda: dinner with my best friend and then I'm going to catch The Gentlemen's Club at the Darkroom on Chicago. I miss band. Laura
It's very challenging to teach students when they are eating school lunches that don't give them the nutrition they need and deserve. Oftentimes what is served barely passes muster as something edible. And after a meal high in sugar and fat and low in fiber, they then must pay attention in a classroom. I'm going to attempt to eat school lunch everyday in 2010. As a teacher it's available to me as well for a few dollars. Most of the students at my school get free lunch or reduced. I'm going to take pictures of the school lunch and post them. Normally I shop for organic fruits and veggies. I avoid processed foods and food high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup, but I normally eat food brought from hom including leftovers, sandwich, or a "healthy" microwave meal for lunch with yogurt and a piece of fruit. The reason I'm eating school lunch every day is to raise awareness about school lunch food in America.
Socialization and Independence. Those are the two main goals that are emphasized by the trainers for START, the grant funded, training series on educating youth with ASD that I'm attending. During a training session I learned about two concepts that can be used to help students assimilate into a classroom--especially a general education one rather than a self contained special education room. The two concepts are Accommodations and Modifications. It might seem that the two terms are interchangeable, but they are not. They are two distinct approaches to educating students with special needs. According to the manual I received, accommodations "are the supports and services that help students validly demonstrate student learning." Modifications "are individualized changes made to the content and performance expectations for students." So accommodating a students means doing something like giving a student a P-touch or a y-shaped pen to help with handwriting (as discussed in this post). It might be giving a student more time to complete a test or giving a student sound blocking headphones for times when classrooms get noisy or when fire drill/tornado drills are expected. There are quite a few different ways to accommodate a student with ASD. Here is a short list of possible accomodations: Adapting the way instruction is delivered (by pre-teaching and re-teaching, for example), Increasing the level of support for the student with ASD (via class tutors, peer to peer support or by placing the student in groups of students who can appropriately interpret the curriculum expectations, Giving preferential seating, Addressing sensory system needs, Organizing the desk/are where the student words, Providing visual strategies such as visual schedules. Modification basically means making the work more doable for the student with special needs with the intent that she or he does not become overwhelmed. For example, if a student can complete a multiple choice test, but has difficulty with too many choices, the number of choices can be reduced by blacking out two or three answers on the test for the child with ASD. Or with general classroom work, it might mean having the student complete selected sections of an assignment as opposed to having them complete all the work. Note: I hope that I explained everything clearly enough, but if you are confused, it is likely you are not alone. We trainees spent a great deal of time learning about these two concepts during our two-day training session. This included completing some exercises so that we could better differentiate between accommodations and modifications. Feel free to ask a question via the comment section and I'll do my best to answer it by consulting my manual or by asking someone else.
Autistic Rights are Disability Rights are Human Rights. That was the topic of the primer I wrote when this blog started back in January. While autism makes us different, autistic rights is really about those things we all need, autistic or not, disabled or not, minority or not: food and shelter, respect and love, and empowerment to live our own lives in freedom, happiness, and health. This is the point I've hoped to make with each post, the perspective I've wished to share. The change I've wanted to initiate. It is deeply satisfying then that this blog itself will be changing to better reflect the AR = DR = HR equation, as autism-specific blogging merges into broader Disability Rights blogging at change.org in the future. This is As It Should Be. As far as my own future, I'll be doing some public blogging still (though with much, much, MUCH less frequency and after a short break) on ASAN's change.org blog (and who knows where else). I'll also be starting a new appointment with the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder (remember that?)--my first real experience with public service and something that would have been literally unimaginable to myself not so long ago. I'll be continuing my advocacy work with ASAN and SAAL. And primarily I'll be working on community based research with AASPIRE, which, believe it or not, has been my "day job" all along. Somewhere in all this, here's hoping I'll facilitate some change in the overall direction of better civil rights and quality of life. Thanks everyone for your time, your comments, and your insights. Keep pushing--keep making the world a better place for us all.
I've been trying to get Joey to start eating more solid foods and boy, is it getting frustrating!! He's been doing so well with stage 3 gerber foods that I figured it was time to try new foods. He absolutely HATES those meltable puffs, the minute he sees them, he clamps his lips shut. Same with teething biscuits, except with them, he also starts crying. I had made myself Kraft Mac & Cheese for lunch yesterday (healthy huh?) and Joey was watching me with such curiosity that I figured, "what the heck, lets give it a try". So I took some and cut them up into small pieces and gave it a whirl. He has the idea down of chewing, but doesn't do it enough or strong enough to mash up his food. This morning I tried scrambled eggs but he decided he didn't like them. I even put ketsup on them hoping that would help. There has been other foods I've tried with him but he just isn't wanting anything but his canned baby food. Also, some new foods he just gags on. It's like he forgets to chew, he just wants to swallow his food the minute it hits his lips! His OT had me go out and buy those mesh things you can put food in for the baby to chomp on but he once again, throws a fit when I try to give it to him. Tonight I'm going to make something for dinner that I can put into the food processor and chop up for him to see if that works. I guess I'm just frustrated but I know I need to keep working with him and he'll eventually take to other foods. I just needed to vent to my fellow moms :)
Sometimes it's easy to be transparent...up to a point. It's not that hard to 'fess up to things that others already know about us. But the hidden stuff we don't want to admit even to ourselves? Not so easy. Everything inside balks at real confession. We are too afraid, too stubborn, too prideful, too selfish, too full of deceit to want to agree with God over the depth of our sinfulness. To do so would break us. Utterly and completely. We fear that shattering, find it unnecessary, and prefer to minimize and rationalize our sin. But we have the assurance that our God will not despise a broken and contrite heart. It is only through seemingly irrepairable brokenness and grief, and the lowliest humility that accompanies such despair, that we can ever become truly whole. Only when we reach the utter end of ourselves will we be able to truly rejoice in the amazing scandal of grace.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about what changes would make school lunch better for students. Here's what I've got so far (I might be shooting for the moon here): 1) Commit to offering pizza only once per month and removing hot dogs from the menu. 2) Offer a piece of fruit at every meal in place of a fruit cup, fruit juice or icee. The fruit part of the meal should be actual fruit and it should be sliced so that kids can grab it and eat it. 3) Allow parents, educators, and students access to nutritional information for each meal. It can be online. 4) Offer greens (spinach, salad, etc) in a salad bar to students every day and educate them on how to make a salad. 5) Remove pre-packaged items (bagel dogs, peanut butter sandwiches, cheese sandwiches, etc) from the menu and replace with casseroles, soups, wraps, or fresh-made PB&Js (all of which are cost-efficient and can be made in very large batches). 6) Commit to a 50% to 75% reduction of plastic/paper containers and remove all styrofoam from the cafeteria. Install dishwashers in all schools (like it used to be). 7) Offer more options geared towards students with allergies and intolerances (lactose, wheat, nut, etc). Might as well educate students on what "lactose intolerant" means and what "allergy" means so they can be on the look-out. 8) Every school has a fully operational kitchen with dishwasher and cooking staff. If it means hiring more workers, let's think of it as a "stimulus plan." It's worth it not to truck in all of this stuff. 9) Every school incorporates new nutrition-based cooking curriculum to students of all ages and requires the students to enter the kitchen and learn basic snack and meal prep. Even pre-schoolers can spread peanut butter or soy-nut butter on celery and put little raisins on top. 10) Teach students where their food comes from by taking a trip to a farm or planting a school garden so that they can be invested in food and have an experience in DIRT! "Dirty" is not a bad word. 11) Actively incorporate recycling into the school program and instruct students on how to recycle and what can be recycled and why it's important. What do you want for students' lunches? I'm going to write a School Lunch Bill of Rights based on my thoughts and your feedback/ideas.
You should know that my job is on the chopping block just like so many educators. So even if I don't lose my job for the blog, I still could be shown the door because they don't have money to pay me. Right now all over the country school administrators and principals are making some very difficult decisions. Cost cutting measures include: laying off all administration and ancillary staff including secretaries, assistant principals, reading specialists, curriculum coordinators, nurses, classroom aides, etc; closing pre-school programs, gifted programs, art, music, computer class, and extra-curriculars because they are not required by law; making kindergarten half-day thereby consolidating classrooms; offering early retirement to older, expensive teachers; letting go new teachers and closing their classrooms; and increasing class sizes to 40. Have you ever seen a classroom with 40 students? I have... on multiple occasions. It's chaos. How does even the most talented teacher manage the behavior of 40 (small) people? I couldn't imagine leaving my child with 40 kids and one person. And that person would be in charge of educating my kid? Yeah, right. It's called bad babysitting. Read: Reduce Class Size Now and Class Size Matters Research has found that for kids K-3 they need a teacher:student ratio of 1:20 (or less) to learn effectively. Many wealthy districts already provide classrooms that size. The classrooms at my school are already in the 1:30 range. Have you ever met a kid walk into kindergarten without any preschool experience and no prep or support at home? Yeah, I have... these kids haven't been read to, don't come from a print-rich environment, and don't know rules and structure. Early childhood programs make a huge difference for children, especially those from disadvantaged homes. Read: Why investments in early childhood work. I have gotten a couple questions from readers asking why I'm tackling school lunches when teaching positions are being closed because there is no money. I'd like to respond by saying: it's not "either/or." We need make the long-term investment in children. We need to fund education. We need the best teachers. We need to feed students the best food we can find so that they can reach their potential as leaders. We are the USA after all! We act like we are the best, but look at how we fund education and school lunches. Do we really value children? ...Oh yeah, and let's add recess back because the last time I checked running around was free.
When I was a little girl, I ate school lunch occasionally. My mom would sit down with the menu provided by the school and we would choose which days I would eat "hot lunch" and which days she would pack my lunch. I remember eating my own packed lunch more often than choosing to eat school lunch. My mom would put dried fruit in my lunch wrapped in little squares of saran wrap. The other kids would be so grossed out by the prunes, but I enjoyed them! My family moved around a lot and we lived in multiple states. My only memories of school lunch revolve not around the food but trying to find a place to sit where people would talk to me. I remember carrying a tray through large cafeterias wracked with anxiety about where I would sit and with whom. Scanning the room with my eyes, I never wanted to eat alone, but I did sometimes. Being new was very hard. I remember my mother putting notes in my lunch bag telling me how much she loved me. I cherished seeing her handwriting on small pieces of paper. It helped me get through some hard days.
Numbers are Still Jumping All Over the Place The title says it all. I am not getting consistent numbers on my blood glucose tests at all. Many nights it comes back in range, only to have the next morning be high. Often I can't think of a thing I've eaten that would make the numbers go too high, but they do anyway. The most glaring example lately was while we were traveling, and I had a grilled pork chop and 2 scrambled eggs. That's all. No toast or grits or any carb at all, and had one of the highest readings I've had so far. So, I've made an appointment with my Diabetes doctor for next week. I wasn't scheduled to see him until November, and I just couldn't wait that long. I did have my last Physical Therapy session yesterday. I've got a pretty good exercise routine now, if I can just make myself do it. I've been so down about the testing numbers that I've not been exercising as much as I should. I'll have to do better, for sure. I had a strange morning this morning ... up to my old ways ... been up since 3:30AM. Don't know what happened, but I woke up wide awake and couldn't get back to sleep. That's all I have for today ... just discouraged right now.
Holy Crap, I'm alive! Yes, its true. I am still breathing. I cant believe I havent posted here since Christmas. I am not even going to try to catch everyone up on December - July so I'll just go with whats going on today. Meds: Lamictal 200mg, Cymbalta 30mg, Geodon 120mg, Klonopin .5 mg/ twice a day. I think thats it. When I last posted I was taking Abilify, so I'll give you a short run down on how that ceased. Basically, I started having tremors...hands, mouth, tongue. So that had to go. Then came Risperdal, that made me lactate. Ummm...yeah, if youve never had that happen, let me just promise you it is weird. Sooo...back to Geodon, which I have taken in the past. Its been a while, possibly 6 months or so that I have been on it, and all is well. I wanna thank you guys for continuing to read even though I am a slacker. I will try to do better. I am just really trying not to dwell on the illness. I do like the fact that this blog seems to help some people, so Im hanging on to it. I appreciate all the comments.
I have so many interesting ideas for the blog, but I really have so little time. I have family commitments and I work full time. Every night immediately after the little one goes to bed, I run straight to my laptop to work on the daily post, look over the comments, and then check out twitter. Lastly I check my email, which in amount can vary widely. This entire process takes at least an hour and if I want to do more than one blog post, I'm on the computer for close to two hours. There are many nights that I turn off my computer, head directly into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and go straight to bed. But I bring home work that I have to do two to three nights per week. It's either a very late night for me or I skimp on the post. Normally I choose to stay up late! The state of our house? Wrecked! I leave everything until the weekend. My husband is picking up the slack (and doing stuff for the blog on the side to help me out), but it's quite taxing on the household. Most nights the dishes do not get done. The reason I'm sharing this is that I want you to know that I really want to interact with you, my readers, more. I want to comment on your comments, but I just don't have the time. I want to respond to all of your emails, but I get the chance. Please forgive me. Time is my enemy.
As a Massage Therapist and avid gardener it is easy to acquire such injuries and I have had extreme pain. There is a wonderful book called something like "No more Carpal Tunnel pain". Which I have used and provided relief to all my problems.I don't remember the author, but, she has a number of helpful exercises that help to release the lactic acid that accumulates in the muscles causing the inflammation and traction that occurs in the ligaments in the medial nerve area. These exercises Include realignment of the radius and ulna at the elbow to release the medial nerve from entrapment. If anyone is interested in more information I can get the book information for you or try looking it up on line. It has been very helpful for my clients as well.
I hope everyone is surviving this cold blast. In Washington, it is unseasonably warm but (as expected) very wet. This week we had a check up with the rehab med doc to see how Darsie's Botox injections were performing. The muscles are all loose (yay!) but because of their memory, they are still pulling her foot inwards. So, he wants our PT to proceed with serial casting. We had good luck with the serial casting during the last round of Botox, but we still have to decide if we want to do it again. It definitely complicates life for all of us. However, I do want to take 100% advantage of the Botox. Bert turned two months! Isn't it amazing how fast time flies? He is such a BOY, too. I look at photos of other babies the same age and he just seems older. I was reading a blog post about a family that got stuck at someone's house due to a snow storm and they had to put her in a size 3 diaper (same age as Bert by a few days) and I just laughed. Bert is officially in size 3 diapers. I don't know if it is because he is a big boy (appointment next week) or just because he is a big-time blower-out of diapers. Jeff turned 33! We spread his birthday celebration from morning 'til night and I have a special adventure planned on Saturday. As well, we have a birthday dinner with his family on Sunday. Nothing like a week long celebration, right? I think we all deserve it. And last, Bert has now started rolling from tummy to back! My baby really is growing up! All remains well with Elise and me, too. Just nothing new to report!
Today's menu: rib-b-que ("all beef patty" with bbq sauce), whole wheat bun, peach fruit cup, beans, milk I have eaten more beef over the past two months than I ate the whole year of 2009. In fact, I never purchase beef at the grocery store. It does not appeal to me. The only times I eat beef are when I order it when we're at a restaurant (very rarely -- maybe in a Chinese stir fry dish) or if it is served at a friend's house. My husband basically refuses to eat beef. We eat a lot of chicken, turkey, and fish that I prepare at home. I wasn't raised eating a lot of red meat. I have enjoyed a bison burger occasionally over the past couple years. Bison burgers are similar to beef in taste, but are far more lean (in both fat and calories -- I looked it up). Actually, I believe bison is better tasting. The best thing about consuming bison is that you are helping support the prosperity of buffalo as a native animal here in the US. Is a pipe dream to think that bison meat could be served at schools? (vegetarian and vegan readers - sorry!) I think somebody is trying to be creative with the "rib-b-que" meat (the illusion of variety), but the kids aren't fooled. I asked one of my students "What did you have for lunch today?" and he replied, "A hamburger."
When I posted about the lack of recess at my school over the weekend, I didn't fully comprehend how big of a deal it really is. That's because the culture of my school has completely normalized not having recess. It's just not done! I chatted very briefly with another teacher about recess last week and that teacher told me that all the kids used to have recess many years ago. At some point it was cut out of the day. At the time I bet the teachers were upset about it, but those teachers have long since retired or moved on. Over the past five years alone there have been [redacted: double digit] new teachers at my school (some brand-new and others with prior teaching experience). So when you start working at a school where there is no recess, you don't make waves since you are untenured. Let's review what my students have on their plate (pun intended): 1) The school lunch that you have seen me eat for two months 2) The only opportunity to run around: a once-a-week gym class 3) No recess The lack of recess is not just a concern where I work, but all over the country. And we're surprised that kids are getting fat, having trouble focusing, and not achieving at the levels seen in other countries? Certainly we can't control what happens at home. I'm just trying to make schools reflect about their role in the increase in childhood obesity. Are schools contributing to the problem?
My first summer outing with this office came to mind.  I was a fresh employee back then, only more than a month working for this organization. I was still feeling my way in at that time and was getting to know my officemates and regular volunteers better.
Aside from health care being a right not a privilege we need to get a CAP put on prescription drug prices. I recently lost a job and almost had to start paying for my injections out of pocket ($498 per injection) one per week. That is $1500 per month for only one of my prescriptions. When I took into consideration all 5 of them it would cost me almost $3000 per month ! What would be the alternative if my husband was not able to get his insurance to pick me up? Suffer and die? No wonder you see so many elderly people giving up and going into crime. WAKE UP BUSCH !!!
Women may have a lower tolerance for exercise. Women have smaller lung capacity than men, which can make women feel as though they are working harder than men even if the women are working at the same level. This can also make exercise feel harder in the heat or high humidity. This doesn't mean it's impossible for women to lose weight and, when you think about, excellent reasons are behind a woman's tendency to store fat. After all, creating and nurturing a new life is nothing to sneeze at. It's always best to avoid comparing yourself to others, whether male or female, when it comes to weight loss. Everyone loses weight differently, and genes, along with hormones, play a large role in how quickly some people lose weight.
Formally known as Sahuayo de Morelos the town is situated in the state of Michoacan, near the southern shore of Lake Chapala. It has a population of almost 60,000 and is known for its traditional sandals (huraches) and hats (sombreros). The name Sahuayo is from the Náhuatl language, and has been interpreted as several different things; however, the favoured definition as translated by Dr. Don Antonio Peñafiel, is that is composed of two elements: tzacual and ayoti. Tzacual is an earthenware vessel shaped by half of a coconut and ayoti means turtle. Thus 'Sahuayo is 'a pot that looks like a turtle'. The turtle is the symbol of Sahuayo.
I woke up one early June morning feeling restless. It was my last day in LA and I had to be in San Francisco before the day is over to catch my flight back to the Philippines. This was probably one of those moments when I wanted to do something outrageous and mind-boggling.Trying to budget my cash-on-hand and wanting to see California minus its glamour and neon lights, I decided to take the Amtrak train from LA to San Francisco, all by myself. The trip I was to take was nine hours and was divided into three legs – a thruway bus from LA Union Station to Bakersfield, a train ride to Emeryville, and another thruway bus to downtown San Francisco.
Some of you saw it as a bump in the road. But it feels more like a shift in the grieving process. Early on it was a heaviness that could not be shaken. Pressure in the heart that wouldn't allow me to breath. Now, it's being alone. And alone isn't fun. It's not the kind of alone that can be filled by calling a friend or going shopping or watching a movie. This "aloneness" comes from missing Leroy. Plain and simple. I'm in the missing part of this process. He left a crater behind where he once stood. That's the way my friend described it, and she's right.
Explorer Benedict Allen opened up with a rousing and harrowing tale of his 300 mile trek through the Amazon…with practically nothing. I could feel the crowd’s breath collectively catch as he talked about how his then-perceived Samaritans robbed him blind and left him to die in the jungle. National Geographic nature photographer Frans Lanting followed up with some breathtaking photographs that showed the relationship between various elements of nature; from the mundane to the awe-inspiring. We were also treated to a sleek preview of his multimedia orchestral performance of Frans Lanting’s LIFE: A Journey Through Time.Foreign correspondent Fergal Keane took us on a moving journey from his childhood to the midst of darkness and despair around the world and back out of it in a poignant talk. From witnessing Rwanda and South Africa to other war-torn regions, I found it surprising at first, then totally heartwarming when he said he’ll never go back to war-torn countries again. That he was done covering after
It's true that often the busier and more unavailable you are, the more time she'll want to spend with you. If you're constantly available, always ringing her and hanging around her like a bad smell she will get sick of you very quickly. On the flip side, at least at the beginning of dating you will need to be the one to call her, as women will never call a guy within the first month or two of dating unless she's very desperate. Calling her on average twice a week and meeting up once a week is usually best and gives her a chance to miss you without forgetting about you completely.
Haciendas were the landed estates of Mexico given to conquistadors in excange for military and social services to the Spanish crown. The Hacienda de Guaracha was mostly aquired through illegal means and by taking over land owned by the The symbol of Sahuayo native people, also forcing them to work on the Hacienda. In 1643 Pedro de Salada was able to legalise the Hacienda. Around this disease was decimating the native population and black slaves were brought in to continue working the land.
At this point I was sure that I would never see my Swiss army knife ever again. I was tempted to plan a rescue mission, going to Rapa Nui myself to get the knife, but no matter how much I loved my knife or how bad I wanted to visit Rapa Nui again, I couldn't rationalize the thousands of dollars it would cost for the mission to get a knife that would cost me only $25 to replace. Besides, my family loved Rapa Nui as well - I might have to take all of them with me!
Hi guys, Sarimah Ibrahim here. I am the host of the inaugural Asia-edition of US reality-competition series, The Biggest Loser Asia! Watch The Biggest Loser Asia Every Tuesday @ 9pm Asia/ 8pm TH/WIB only on Hallmark Channel. I have been asking questions about health on Yahoo! Answers Malaysia in the last few weeks. This is my fourth question. Please let me know what are your opinions.
We pulled into Agra on November 8th around 8:00 PM. It was dark, but not dark enough. Some places should never be seen in daylight, Agra is one of them. It was crowded, it was dirty, it was seedy, it was... We had heard it was rip-off city, we could see why. Then we arrived at our hotel. Thinking back, I'd say it was the worst of our accommodations. They handed us a pad lock key. You unlocked the pad lock and then, once in the room, you put the pad lock on the inside to lock others out, or to lock yourselves in. It was for just one night I told myself but I knew I wouldn't get much sleep with one eye open.
If we don't socialize medicine, we need to make it so that working families can afford health coverage. I am a single, working mother of 2, I have insurance through my job but it is expensive (13% of my gross wages). Last year my Gross income was $19,000. I have one child who qualifies for medicaid (Secondary) and one who does not. I don't know how that works since they both have the same parents.
Coming from a warm country, the slight chilly San Francisco air was already freezing me. Good thing I have a comfortable room with a soft bed and plenty of pillows that warmed me during the night.
When I arrived at my hotel, I immediately called some local contacts, including a college friend who lived in the next city. As soon as I finished with all the preparations, my friend met up with me and brought me to the local mall, LimKetKai. While walking and chatting at the mall, we bumped into another college acquaintance and she was surprised to see us at CDO since my friend and I were not from that place.
Looking forward to the Travellers’ Tales Festival in London this week; an excellent opportunity to network with fellow travel writers and photographers. The 3-day agenda seems quite mouthwatering. Friday’s lineup includes photography and writing programmes, creative tutorials, panel discussions with editors from the UK National press as well as networking opportunities. Saturday and Sunday will bring a variety of lectures and more goodies. Will keep my nose to the ground for stories worth telling and will be on the lookout for those photographic moments. Finding unique angles and takes on one of the most photographed cities and sights in the world will be my challenge for this weekend.
My 33 year old daughter is mentally ill. She also has Lupus. She was a school teacher when she developed Schizoid Affective Disorder. She collects social security disability, mental health services from the state, but she has no health insurance. Her benefits are not enough to cover the premiums. It will be another year before she is able to be on medicare. She needs medical services now! There needs to be something to fill the gap.
Some people fear their first time, but instead they should truthfully embrace it, because it only happens once and is a truly unique experience, because after the first time, it’s no longer something you haven’t done before and will become something you can understand and expect. The moral of the story here is to throw yourself into your first time travels (road trips or otherwise), not to be apprehensive about them, as you will only have one chance at a first time and it’s something to be cherished and enjoyed, not hampered by “what ifs” and other numerous worries. After all, travel is supposed to be rewarding and relaxing, isn’t it?
As night enveloped the sky, we spent our sumptuous dinner gazing at the glowing lights of urban towns and the port in Batangas. Since we had the island almost to ourselves, we set up a bonfire at the sand bar, chatting, drinking, and playing games with the twinkling stars above us.
It was a good thing that I studied downtown San Francisco very intently before I embarked on this trip or I could have been lost under its dark, starry night. But what also made it easier for me was that Hilton was located about two blocks from the metro station.
The next day, we embarked on a trip to another small island close to Bonito. The waves were rough despite the short distance. The island we were visiting was uninhabited save for the light house that stood at the middle of it. The underwater life there was livelier than the corals at Bonito but the current was stronger.
By 1905 the process of lowering the levels of Lake Chapala had begun, creating more fertile land for farming. However in 1912 a levee along the lake ruptured causing a severe water shortage for the people of Sahuayo and the surrounding area. This internal problem prevented the local people from fully participating in the Mexican Revolution which came about when Francisco I. Madero led an uprising against the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. The Revolution ended with the creation of the Mexican Constituation in 1917.
The first inhabitants of the area were of Aztec origin. Later the region was conquered by the P'urepecha (known as the Tarasco by the Spanish). Led by Tzitispandacuare the Tarascans defended their territories against the Aztecs. The Tarascans flourished in Mexico from 1100CE to 1530CE and although their exact origins are unknown linguistic similarities to the Quechua language of South America suggest they came from further south. The Tarascans and Aztecs were enemies and were frequently at war with each other. The Spanish empire saw the end View of the church in the evening of both empires. Knowing the Spaniards were on their way to the Aztec capital of Tenochitlan the Aztecs sent emissaries to the Tarascans to ask for assistence in fighting the Spaniards. Instead, the Tarascans sacrificed the Aztec messengers. Tenochitland fell in 1520 after a bloody seige and a scant two years later the Tarascan Empire was conquered too.
I'd like to see drug companies have less influence over consumers. Since they've been allowed to advertise their latest thing on television, patients are telling their doctors what to prescribe. Generic drugs may work just as well, but we are a brand loving society. Rather than sticking with the tested (and inexpensive) generics, we push our doctors to prescribe the new drug we saw on tv last night. Not only does this encourage people to spend more money on drugs unnecessarily, it encourages the drug companies to continue developing new versions of similar drugs. I read that we haven't developed a totally new antibiotic in decades. Rather than develop a drug that will be used once, drug companies focus on new variations of drugs for long term use, because they can make money off of it. And boy, can they make money! I know that the true cost includes both the development AND production of the drug, but it seems like the companies are making a heck of a profit. If they can sell the same drug for a fraction of the cost in other countries, why can't they sell it for a reasonable price here?
Others might have thought I’ve gone bonkers but it was something I had already set my mind on. Of course, there was some anxiety on my part as I would be traveling alone but I braved through it and trusted my guardian angel to be by my side during the entire trip. Traveling alone on unfamiliar surroundings seemed a dreary thought but I shook my apprehensions away and readied my belongings.My friend who generously took me in her LA apartment for five days volunteered to bring me to the Union Station. We dragged my heavy luggage as we took the subway at downtown LA.
The chattering of kids grew louder. Feet stomping quickly through the tunnel. Wheels from luggage being dragged. Noises bouncing off the walls, making the narrow half mile tunnel seem like it was slowly getting narrower. I had to get out. To get some air. Normally not claustrophobic, very little sleep in three days was throwing off my internal radar.Quickly darting out of the next exit I saw, one of many sprinkled alongside the tunnel, I popped up beside the Natural History Museum, eerily illuminated against murky dark skies.
The chefs on Top Chef don't know it, but they've lost one of their biggest fans. We would watch and marvel at how these contestants would whip up some beautiful food on a plate with just a few mushrooms, something reduced in a pot, and something else the chefs would call "protein." Of course, we simply know it as fish, meat, or poultry. And when I'm scanning the movie channels and stumble across Gladiator, Blood Diamond or heaven help me, the one millionth showing of Dirty Dancing, I just reach for the power button on the clicker.
In 1926 the parish church of Sahuayo was the second place attacked by Federal soldiers. After the end of the religious conflict and during Lazaro Cardenas governorship of Michoacan the lands of the Hacienda de Guaracho were shared between the farmers of Sahuayo. On 28th November 1952, due to its economic development Sahuayo was granted city status and then in 1957 the city once again changed its name to Sahuayo de Jose Maria Morellos in honour of one of the revolutionary leaders in the War of Independance.
I’ve fallen asleep in most of the trip. I would often wake up to watch the scenery. It was a peaceful and delightful journey. Apart from mountains, we also passed by vineyards, orchards, strawberry farms, wheat and corn fields, ranches, cattle farms, rivers, junkyards, windmills, neighborhoods, and mostly depots. Yes, in the 410-mile stretch I’ve traveled, depots were everywhere. It was apparent that industrial parks and agricultural industries have been designated outside of large metropolis such as LA and San Francisco.
I was the first one to arrive at the station. I sat at the bench as I waited for my bus. One by one, other passengers arrived. A lady sat beside me. She introduced herself as Marylou. I think she was in her 50s or 60s. Despite our wide age difference, we instantly hit it off and became fast friends. She animatedly shared stories with me. She came from Visalla (that I’m not sure of) and was in LA to visit a friend. Grateful for this encounter and for having found a nice company in this journey, I asked her if we could sit together in the bus, to which she readily agreed. But when I found out that there were several empty seats on the bus, I decided to take the seats on the opposite row so we could have more room during the ride. The bus was indeed large with overhead compartments where we could store additional baggage and, more importantly, a restroom at the back.
Yes they have a faster metabolism and there biological make up is different from an women's. Women's bodies has to know how to retain fat because they have to carry babies and give them nutrients. Men on the other hand are suppose to be the provider, thats the way god meant for it to be, so they have to be leaner and stronger. Men where meant to fight the elements and "bring home the bacon". We are also suppose to be soft for them because we are there cherished ladies and they are suppose to be able to protect us from harm.
What I liked about CDO were the unique and interesting eateries in the city. Every time I go to this city, I would always eat in a fascinating restaurant. Another time, I had dinner in an Italian-inspired jaunt. One of my favorite coffee shop was Gazebo Café, because apart from the mouthwatering desserts and snacks, I also liked the ambiance and the home products they were selling at their cute tiny store, adjoining the café.
As a pre 9/11 traveler, I travelled for years with my Swiss army knife in my carry on backpack; I never went anywhere without it. It was used for everything and I couldn't imagine being on the road and not having it at my disposal. So in June, 2008, before leaving for our year around the world, I consciously took my Swiss army knife and placed it in my toiletry bag which travelled in my checked luggage. Each time I arrived to a new destination and unpacked, I took the knife out of my toiletry bag and placed it in the daypack that was used for our daily outings. So began the ritual...Packing for a flight, put the knife in my toiletry bag; settling into a new location, unpack the knife and put in in the daypack. It was a flawless practice for 9 months, 18 travel days and 32 locations.
But what was even wonderful in this island is the rich marine life. I fed several fishes, including a rainbow-colored fish, which the locals called pico de loro. Our guide brought us around the coral reef and found numerous colorful species of corals that came in different designs and sizes.
The resort was also affordable with about less than a thousand pesos per cottage a night (that’s about $20). I think they also rent out diving equipment for divers and boats for those who want to go to Apo Island.
We hardly knew him. He joined our community on December 16th. It was his birthday weekend and the beast had found him. Randy had an openness about him. I think he was shocked to find himself in this place, so he got down to the business of cancer right away. He wanted the road map through this world and this group was ready to lead him.
i want to make my own fried rice but im not sure what kind of rice to use i tried jasmin rice but it was too mushy i tried uncle ben rice but it didnt taste good what kind do the resturants use also if there is a certain brand let me know there is asian store were i live but im not sure which to choose
As soon as our feet landed on the sand, we immediately claimed our welcome drinks at the dining hall to cool us off from the hot sunny trip. Since it was high noon, we proceeded with lunch and spent our siesta eating green mangoes. The dining hall, as well as some of the facilities, was built with wood and local materials and had an open space that provided a wonderful view of the swimming pool, the sand bar, and the neighboring islands. The hall was situated at the tip of the heart-shaped island. Coconut trees dotted the beach front.
We've outsourced everything else, why not have video teleconferencing with doctors from other countries? That way-hospitals can refer non-paying non-urgent patients to lower paid doctors to diagnose remotely. This may also solve some of the personal tort issues-if you agree to be seen by a doctor who is not in the country when he diagnoses-you can't sue.
After eating our meal and taking photos of every nook and cranny of the restaurant, we proceeded to the art gallery found across the parking lot. Other services, like massage and spa, were also available at Kusina Salud. The sun was beckoning us. It was time to leave Kusina Salud and continue with our food trip through the Viaje del Sol.
On 10th December, 1831, Sahuayo was finally recognised as a legl entity. Throughout the reform age it was a refuge for conservative forces until 1861. At this time the owner of the Hacienda de Guaracha, Dona Anotonia Moreno, sold half the land to over 50 rich buyers. Shortly afterwards the Second French Empire began their invasion of Mexico led by Napolean III in an attempt to force the Mexicans to settle their debts to France, Spain and Britain who, until 1861, had been receiving interest Sahuayo payments from Mexico.Sahuayo and the neighbouring towns faced raids from both sides. On 13th April 1891 Sahuayo changed its name to Sahuayo de Porfirio Diaz after the then president of Mexico and the town was elevated to the status of villa.
Remember what the experts tell those of us who are hurting from our time in cancer world. Get plenty of rest, eat well, and exercise. And if you have a "Carol" in your life, you'll find that winter is what you make it.
Brown hills and mountains filled the landscape. There were small communities visible from the highway, one of which was found at the foot of Mt. Frazier. Less than an hour later, we entered Bakersfield. It’s a small town. Yet, progress seemed to be catching up with a Marriott Hotel beside the station as well as international fast food chains like KFC and A&W scattered around the area.
Most of the groups were filled up and no one signed up for American food. Probably, because most of the participants were American, they wanted other kinds of cuisine. It was only me and my roommate who signed up for that group. Since we had a host with us, we didn’t want to impose on them if there were just two of us. Luckily, we met other conference participants and we encouraged them to join us.
Sometimes a relationship starts to feel like nothing but a power struggle. If you're involved with a dominating personality, and you've had a lifetime of conditioning to please your partner, it can be difficult to hang onto your own identity AND have a relationship. But it doesn't have to come down to a choice between staying in the relationship and losing your identity, or ending the relationship and rediscovering who you are. Here's how to discover and assert your own demands within the paradigms of your existing relationship.
I like thinking back to where I was a year ago. Not only is it an opportunity to relive a dream, it's an opportunity to think of someplace warm. I don't like the cold and having had a year of mild temperatures enables me to always think warm when reminiscing.
It's unrealistic to think that we could easily change to a national health care plan in this country. It would involve wiping out all insurance companies, and creating one enormous new government entity. Instead, we need to work within the system we have to reduce costs and increase coverage. So my suggestion? Start controlling the insurance and drug companies, and stop letting them control us. Or more specifically, stop letting them control you, our government.
