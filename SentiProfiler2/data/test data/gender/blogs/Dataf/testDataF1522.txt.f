There are many things in life that make me happy. Little things, things that just make me smile. One of my favorites is Post Secret Sundays. Post Secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named Frank. Frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. Write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the address already written on the card. It grew into quite a phenomena. Now, Frank gets postcards from all over the world. He's compiled them and published more than one book. And every Sunday, Frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. Even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed.

Every Sunday, I log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. It's a simple pleasure that I truly enjoy. The secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful.

Everyone has secrets. Little secrets, like you really don't like your friend's new haircut. Unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). And big, important secrets, ones you don't even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it.
