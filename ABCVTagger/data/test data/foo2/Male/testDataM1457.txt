I was going over what I was writing about the bullpen when compared with last season, and unfortunately I don't think I can make a comparison until Opening Day. I have no idea, outside of the mainstays (K-Rod, Feliciano, Parnell), who will be on the roster. The short summary is that I was pumped for the 8-9 combo of Putz and K-Rod last season, bullpens are notoriously unpredictable year to year, and Ambiorix Burgos may have killed someone with his car. As of now, I'm not even all that certain who the fifth starter will be. The team seems intent on having that be either Niese or Nieve, but neither is pitching like they want the job (at least not when compared to Misch and Figueroa). So, my bullpen summary will be postponed until next month, when I have a clue as to the composition. That being said, there are some position battles that the organization are ignoring because they arose out of injury. Shortstop: Jose Reyes and his overactive thyroid has opened an every day job for Alex Cora. Cora is a known commodity, which is one of my favorite backhanded compliments. I'm no expert with major league playing time and minor league options, but I'd like to see Tejada man the spot. He's hitting well enough right now, and I'm not sure how much that counts in Spring, but its better than not hitting at all. I'm not sure the Mets want to do that, but I think it's time we start looking at developing this kid, especially when I hear his defense and speed are major-league ready. Centerfield: Poor Gary Matthews, Jr. What am I saying? Rich Gary Matthews, Jr. Whatever you call him, he's the odd man out in the CF battle. The job looks like it will go to Pagan, who, if he realizes his upside, could be a known commodity. I know everyone will have terror flashbacks when they think of Fernando Martinez's cup of coffee last season, but he's tearing the cover off the ball now. Again, this is Spring Training, so it may not be worth much, but maybe he carries that over into the start of the season. I think Manuel should take a good look at F-Mart to start the season. I know these are temporary position battles, but I think that's all the more reason to go with youth. Let's get some young energy out there. Who knows when Beltran returns, and what the condition of his knee is? And with Reyes, I'm certainly no endocrinologist. Here’s my problem with John Maine. I think we’re all getting sick of his tired act. It’s becoming the ‘same ole story’ with this guy. After following Johan Santana's 4-inning gem with a disaster, this is what he had to say: "My mechanics felt fine...I just wasn't kind of that into it. It wasn't good. It's just I wasn't all that prepared. The feeling that it's not my game is the hardest thing. It's a waste of a day." What the fuck is this guy doing on the mound if he's just not that into it? And claiming to be unprepared when you know exactly when you are going to pitch? I don’t get it, is it not your game because Johan Santana started it, it's Spring Training? Suck it up guy and pitch. Stop being a little bitch, that's what you get paid to do. Enough of the sappy follow ups, we don't give a shit, just get it done. Granted, there’s a lot of Spring Training left, and that’s great for John. He better use the time wisely to straighten himself out because I have news for John. If he comes out of the gate stumbling and struggling, his tired nice guy act is not going to fly for too long. He is now two years removed from his stellar 15-10 season, his only full season in the majors. So this season becomes very important for John to prove his worth. Our patience is thin to begin with and there are other guys chomping at the bit that have the ' cojones ' to take his place. Here are possible suitors ready to pounce on Maine's job. You have Hisanori Takahashi who is a veteran student of the game, can start and has been lights out. Jonathon Niese is in line for the 5 th starters' spot, if he doesn ’t win that job, he can steal Maine's. Nelson Figueroa, who no one is talking about, hasn ’t given up an earned run yet. Then there's Fernando Nieve and Jenrry Mejia. I don't think Nieve is the answer, and hopefully Mejia will start the year in the pen. But you catch my drift here, there are options if Maine sucks again. If not any of the above, Mets have stated that financially, they can take on more salary via a trade or what not. John Maine Just Isn't That Into You [NBC] Only the Mets…unbelievable! Mets say Jose Reyes has an overactive thyroid. Jose Reyes is saying: "Los especialistas que me atendieron en Nueva York me dijeron que estaba bien y que no tengo problemas de la tiroide" "Me dijeron que solamente tenía la garganta inflamada y no necesitaba medicinas para la tiroide u otra cosa" "La única recomendación de los especialistas fue que no comiera mariscos por la cantidad de yodo que contienen y que debía chequearme cada tres semanas para ver como sigue todo" Translation: “The specialists that attended me in New York told me that I’m fine and that I don’t have thyroid problems. They told me that I just had throat inflammation and that I don’t need medication for thyroid or anything else. The only recommendation the specialists gave me is to not eat fish due to high iodine it contains and to get checked out every three weeks to see how things are going.” Anyone see Jay Horowitz? Jay Horowitz anyone? Jay, are you there? What does this man get paid to do? Besides that good for nothing PR moron, you have to just scratch your head and say, “What the fuck? Who’s smoking crack here?” It’s got to be one of the following. Either Reyes is lying, or he didn’t understand the doctors. Or are the Mets being overly stupidly cautious to lie due to them being scared shit that god forbid something happens to Reyes if he starts playing and this problem pops up again? See past. This is just getting stupid now. Maybe fathead Jay Horowitz will make an appearance. Diagnóstico diferente de Reyes y Mets [ESPN Deportes] Welcome to "In Memoriam." A segment where we take a moment to celebrate, castigate, and otherwise reminisce on former Mets both good and evil. This edition: The Kid, Gary Carter, and his outrageous new Twitter feed! It wasn’t too long ago when Gary Carter went a little looney on us. Early in 2008, with Willie Randolph on the chopping block, Carter sounded off with a 'pick me I'm available' public pitch to manage the Mets. "I just want them to know of my availability. I'm only a phone call away because my contract allows me to leave the ballclub. I could be in New York tomorrow, if necessary, because if there's anything at the major league level I can leave this job." Carter, being the manager of the Orange County Flyers of the Independent Golden League in California at the time, of course recanted after the firestorm he created. "I want to clear this up especially...I never wanted to try to undermine or do anything to bring this to a situation where I'm trying to campaign for something...I would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. I would love that opportunity. [But] I wish Willie well." Interestingly enough, he also did this in 2004 when Art Howe was taking up space in the dugout. But hold on to your shorts, the Kid is back and rawer than ever on his new Twitter feed - Gary Carter Raw . We've heard about athletes, celebrities, and even the president taking to Twitter. Here comes Gary Carter, spewing outrageous thoughts on everything from fucking single moms, Dykstra and the bathroom blow jobs, to Kevin Mitchell being a snitch, and everything in between. Here's a taste: "Dave Magaden was lactose intolerant. But that didn't stop him from fucking Long Island cows on the daily" On centerfielder-turned-Bernie-Madoff-accompice Lenny Dystra: "When clubs got boring, we'd tell bouncers a homo kid with a mullet was offering BJ's in the mens room. They'd grab Dykstra, he'd fight back" On current Angels manager Mike Sciocia: "Little known fact...the retard in the movie "leaving las Vegas" that rapes Elizabeth Shue in the ass was Mike Scioscia, and he was not acting" Dropping a dime on former teammates: "Sid Fernandez and I coached a little league team in crown heights just to fuck single moms" "Its no surprise Kevin Mitchell left the team... he was a fucking snitch" "I caught Matt Williams jerking off while listening to Sinbads comedy tape on his walkman. Weird thing was I caught him in Will Clark's trunk" "Steve Sax seat on the bench was warmer than Robin Yount's wife's beard!" "I did a short stint as a "Coyote" south of the border...I still technically own Rafael Santana and his family" Need we say more? This is truly a must-follow for Mets fans on Twitter (twitter.com/GaryCarterRaw). Gary, you are a fucking genius, please continue to entertain us. Carter apologizes for comments saying he wanted Mets' job [MLB] Lizzie Grubman and her Power Girls would have never let this happen. In fact, had they done the job, there would not be any complaints about the abstructed view seats at Citi Field. They would have the skill to convince fans that obstructed seats are the new wave and that you aren't anyone unless you had an obstructed seat. So in Citi Field's inagural season, the Mets, instead of letting fans know that the seats they were buying were somewhat obstructed, they hit the airwaves with a retarded statement. I'm still trying to decipher what this means. In a truly bizarre appearance on WFAN, team executive David Howard told fans that they didn't understand the nature of obstructed views because these seats merely had blind spots that meant you weren't able to see the entire field. Huh? It was just one more example of a team battling poor PR with even worse PR. Just as they refused to admit any mistakes with the medical staff or front office employees challenging minor leaguers to fights, they refused to admit that they made a mistake by not telling customers the whole story. Now there will be a warning for fans buying obstructed view seats. Are we seeing a change in PR policy? I doubt it as long as the current PR staff is in place. Warning reads: View: Limited portions of the playing field may not be visible from this seat location. Mets Stop Being Obstructionist About Stadium Obstructions [NBC] As I indicated last week, there is a reasonable expectation that the pitching will improve this season when compared to 2009. However, there are several reasons to expect that improvement to be marginal (though I expect it to be significant). The offense, on the hand, is another matter... Following is the projected lineup comparison (once Beltran returns from knee surgery). 2009 Opening Day Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Daniel Murphy - LF 3. Carlos Delgado - 1B 4. Carlos Beltran - CF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Ryan Church - RF 7. Brian Schneider - C 8. Luis Castillo - 2B 2010 Projected Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Luis Castillo - 2B 3. Carlos Beltran - CF 4. Jason Bay - LF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Jeff Francoeur - RF 7. Daniel Murphy - 1B 8. Rod Barajas - C Let's go by order in the lineup and see what improvements we can expect from this year's team. 1. Obviously, we need more than the 36 games we got last year from Reyes. Oddly, he may start the season in the three slot (this is more apparent after yesterday's Spring Training game), which has arguable merit. The leadoff spot was manned best in Reyes' absence by Angel Pagan until he got hurt. Pagan is my odds-on favorite to win the CF job and get the leadoff slot should Manuel decide to bat Reyes third until Beltran returns. Assuming one month of Pagan and the rest of the season with Reyes, this slot can't help but be a significant improvement over last year. 2. Murph was overhyped coming out of Spring last season. Also, the sky is blue, the President is Black, and Elmer Fudd has problems with the letter "R". On the opposite end, I don't know that we could have expected any less from Castillo. I'd take a repeat of last year from Castillo as the perfect no. 2 slot season (and word is, he's lost more weight and is in better shape this year). 3. Carlos Delgado just had hip surgery - no, not that surgery, this is a new one. I'm sad for him, in part because I thought we could take a late flyer on him with an incentive-laden deal and he could wrestle the job from Murph. Before he got hurt, he was the only guy hitting moon shots to right at Citi Cavern. I think we've seen the last of Delgado, in any uniform. Odds are we'll see Reyes for a month in this slot and then Beltran for the balance of the season. Again, nowhere to go but up. 4. Bay jumps into a slot that was best manned last year by... wait for it... Gary Sheffield. Yes, that Gary Sheffield, who if he lands a job this Spring will have played in four different decades. Bay has his issues, and maybe the back end of this contract will be ugly, but for now he replaces what we thought we'd get from Delgado last year, but from the right side. He will certainly be an improvement over Murph in left and is a .380 OBP guy who slugs over .500 and plays every day. 5. Which David Wright will we get this year? The guy who had his worst season as a pro, or the all-star we had for the previous four seasons. I remember arguments about who you'd take first to start a team - Wright or Pujols (now that argument is Mauer or Pujols). Wright's anemic power may have been the result of little protection, adjustments to a new ballpark, girlfriend troubles, who knows... But, if you're so inclined, take a look at his numbers last year. Ignoring the low homerun total, it wasn't all that bad a year. In fact, it was a pretty good year (144 games, 80+ runs, 70+ rbis and a .390 OBP). Expect his slugging to improve some, Pujols to be caught on the juice and the argument to be Mauer vs. Wright. 6. This is the most underrated position upgrade on the team. Church was a AAAA player. Francoeur may not live up to the promise he showed in his early years as a Brave, but he has good pop, plays great defense in right (he has a sick cannon) and is a takes his lunchpail kind of guy. I wish he'd learn to take a walk, but if you look at his numbers as a Met last year (.311 BA, 10 HR, 40 R, 41 RBI in 75 games), there's proof the change of scenery worked. 7. I'm not a fan of Murph. Keith Hernandez is working with him on his defense. Thoughts are he'll platoon with Tatis. Maybe Jacobs will win the job. This is a hole, but on Opening Day last year we had Schneider. I'm hoping for midseason upgrade here - maybe Dunn, or even Keith if he wants to put the uniform back on. 8. Barajas plays defense, hits homeruns and doesn't get on base much. He can throw folks out, which will be fun. Also, it's looking like Blanco will be Santana's caddy, and I think that can help. Ok, so the seventh and eighth slots are problems. Still, we have reason to expect way more out of this offense than last year, even if there are some injuries. That leaves us with the bullpen... You have to look way back to find Mets team that had great team chemistry. Not that it’s been bad with the recent Mets, but it definitely has not been great. A key component to a winning team, you can’t buy chemistry. As a GM, putting a team together based on skills, stats, and baseball attributes is tough enough. When you add in the layer of evaluating players’ personalities in a quest to create a team that will get along besides playing great baseball, there’s no clear formula to success. GM’s will target players that will help their club, and besides the few troubled players that some teams will stay away from for the fear of bringing in a ‘cancer’ to the locker room a la Milton Bradley, chemistry seems to fall under the radar most often than not when making these major investments. When the Mets picked up ‘Frenchie’ Jeff Francoeur, the last thing that factored into the decision was his personality. As long as he didn’t kill any teammates or coaches in the past, the Mets were bringing him to Queens so they can rid themselves of Church. The Mets never thought anything to the effect of, “this guys great in the clubhouse, lets find a way to get him”. Well what do you know, Frenchie has brought some life to this team. Lets hope it translates to chemistry, which will at least give Mets fans some quality baseball to watch again. The last time I can truly say I saw a Mets tea
 with great team chemistry, you have to look back to the days of Ron Darling, Tim Teufel and co., causing havoc in some honky tonk Texas bar. That was team chemistry at its finest, you just sensed it. Everyone hated them, outside of NY that is, but they had fun, played great together, and had each others backs no matter what. It was also the last time the New York Mets won the championship. Now we haven’t seen any hotfoots out of Frenchie, but he’s becoming a social leader on the team. Along with newcomer, Jason Bay, they set up a viewing party for the U.S. v Canada gold medal hockey game Sunday. According to Frenchie, Mets can expect more social gatherings this year. Our first trip this year is to Colorado, and we have a Monday night off. Guys can go out all day. But we should go out together at night. Let's go have a ball. As a player, these types of things make the clubhouse a more comfortable place to be in and a place they want to play in. Lets give credit where credit is due, Mets received a huge intangible with Frenchie at a low cost. Gold-Medal Chemistry Builder for Mets [MLB] As Spring approaches, I always get optimistic. Now that it looks like, save for the possible addition of a left-handed reliever, the roster is set, I can start to analyze what it is we have at each position. First, lets take a look at what all of sports radio, and every fan I talk to, says needed to be addressed this offseason - starting pitching. Let's look at the projected rotation vs. last year's Spring projection. 2009 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Tim Redding / Livan Herandez 2010 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Jon Niese / Fernando Nieve / Nelson Figueroa et al. What a difference a year makes? One through four are the same, and last year's depth is now this year's unaddressed problem. The common theory goes: "you know you get with Johan (even though he's coming off elbow surgery), but 2, 3 and 4 are all head cases." Pelfrey regressed in an alarming manner, and you have to hope he'll bounce back in some way. In flashes during the 2008 season, he looked like a legitimate no. 2 starter. Ollie P is a head case, but also has been a big game pitcher for the Mets in the past (and still has electric stuff when focused). Perhaps I would have rather signed Randy Wolf to a one-year deal, and no way was Ollie worth three years a $12 million per, but we was coming off two pretty good seasons with the Mets, especially 2007. There was no reason to expect such a miserable 2009, and while many feel he was shut down due to a phony injury, people don't have surgery on phony injuries. John Maine was obviously still hurt, and maybe we don't know what we'll get from him. While that is a lot of uncertainty, short of signing Lackey or dealing for Halladay (neither of which was realistic for the Mets), there isn't much the Mets could do this offseason to fix it. Armes like Marquis and Pineiro don't move me much. Where I might have taken a chance are high-risk, high-reward guys like Sheets, Wang and Bedard. However, Sheets price himself out, and Wang and Bedard may not pitch until deep into the season (without the help of the Mets' crack medical staff). What we hope for here is a few less injuries. Simply getting something close to 180 innings out of each of these guys will be a dramatic improvement over last season, especially because can't help but improve. Tomorrow I'll discuss the projected lineup and the various improvements over last year.
