OK March 1st and now a new mind set.  At least I am trying to focus on the positive:):):)
It has been a fun past few days , I have been blog browsing.  Blog browsing can be quite fun, but sometimes I would get a little kick in the gut when you see all of the family blogs.  Really, everyone is so in love with their kids?!?!  I mean I unconditionally love my children and do everything I can for them but really people.  Maybe because most of them only have about 1 to 2 kids, but is everyone being so real on their blogs.... " I am married to the best guy...... I have three wonderful kids......blog, blog, blog and so on."  Get my picture?
Really I do have a great husband and three wonderful kids.  I ask myself all the time how did I become so blessed .  I am working on finding myself again because being a wife and mom can cause a woman to lose themselve, so I will not be boasting about my wonderful family.  Sorry, at least not right now!
Sometimes it seems so surreal that I am  somebodies mother, it is like when did this happen?!?!

Then as I navigate the new world of blogging I am amazed at the layouts and wonder who the hell has all this time on their hands?!?!?  I am lucky to be able to have the time to blog when I can and it is not very often.  Do any of you work?!?!  I guess there are lots of creative people in this world !  Ok that does not sound like a good mindset does it.
