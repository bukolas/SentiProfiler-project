My 33 year old daughter is mentally ill. She also has Lupus. She was a school teacher when she developed Schizoid Affective Disorder. She collects social security disability, mental health services from the state, but she has no health insurance. Her benefits are not enough to cover the premiums. It will be another year before she is able to be on medicare. She needs medical services now! There needs to be something to fill the gap.
