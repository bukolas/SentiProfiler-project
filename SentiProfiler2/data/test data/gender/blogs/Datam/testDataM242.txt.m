We may not know much more about "lasers" than Austin Powers's nemesis, Dr. Evil, but we can tell you that Logitech has put the technology to outstanding use in its MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse. It's not as huge a shift as it was going from rollerballs to optical sensors, but the MX1000 does usher in a new age in computer mice.

Logitech claims that its new MX Laser Engine is 20 times more sensitive than a standard LED. While it may be able to read a finer image, the MX1000 still uses a relatively common 800-dots-per-inch (dpi) optical sensor--the same as in Logitech's MX510 Performance Mouse. But because the laser tracks movement more accurately than a standard LED, the MX1000 takes a more precise read of the surface, resulting in more exact cursor movement onscreen.

The cursor never jumped or paused in the three months we used it, and in addition to the $80 MX1000's laser precision, it is comfortable to use--for right-handers, anyway. The deeply carved left side provides a snug perch for your thumb, and the rubberized plastic on either side makes for exceedingly comfortable mousing. You'll find three programmable keys above your thumb and three more, including the scrollwheel itself, are on the top.

The wireless mouse ships with an RF base station, which doubles as a battery charger. Battery life is phenomenal; you can go days without recharging. We particularly like the battery-power meter along the top of the mouse. You may forget to recharge the MX1000 at the end of the day because the battery lasts so long on a single charge, so the three green LEDs are a good reminder: when it gets down to one light, it's time to recharge.
