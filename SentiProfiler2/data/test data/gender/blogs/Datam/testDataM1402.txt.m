I am afraid I dont agree with you! with your suggestions it will become congress 2! why do we want another congress pretender? Office holders and tickets should be only given to people who succeed on an internal competition irrespective of caste or religion what you have proposed is internal reservations to christians musllims OBC's and dalits! a shadow cabinet is a good idea! The important change we need is NO wishywashy principles they should nail their colours to the mast and campaign for uniform civil code, abolition of sec 370, abolition of caste politics, abolition of minority appeasement abolition of reservations and sops, and treat ALL indians equal!
