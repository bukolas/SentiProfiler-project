Every piece of advice a father can impart on his son can make all the difference in the world. 

    Sometimes it doesn’t even involve words…

    My father came from a family where the word “love” was scarcely shared. My dad was never the one for words. He always worked long hours or terrible shifts as a coal miner in West Virginia when I was young. When the coal mines shutdown, we moved to Florida where the cost of living was higher and the wages lower. My dad worked…that’s what he did.
