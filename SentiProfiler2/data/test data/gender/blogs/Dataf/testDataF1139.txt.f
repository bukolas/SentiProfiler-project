How would you describe time? Does it fly by too fast or stand still? Do you know “where the time went?” It's hard to believe we're already a decade into the 21st century! Ten years ago, we had concerns about Y2K and how it would wreak havoc on the world. Now we're dropping the double zero's as we head into the year, “twenty-ten.” Like it or not, the clock continues to tick, ringing in a new year every 365 days. Do any of you have January birthdays? I do. In addition to celebrating a new year, in the coming days, I'll be adding another year to my life. That's a good thing, I guess. It's a whole lot better than the alternative! With the passage of another year, many of us reflect on the years gone by and the milestones of our lives. We often revisit the days of our past and wonder how we made it this far. Or, we relive an occasion that brought joy to our hearts, causing us to smile once again.
