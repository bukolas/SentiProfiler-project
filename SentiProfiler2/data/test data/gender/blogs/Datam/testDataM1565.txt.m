Guinness is another beer with a pseudo cult following.  There are people that love the stuff so much they buy hats and shirts to let you know they like Guinness.  Guinness represent something of a different take on beer than most people are use to. It is dark and looks different. I guess people respond to that sort of anti-yellow beer sort of thing. I remember in my younger light beer drinking days I pretty much thought Guinness was a horrible joke. Why would anyone drink something that dark and heavy?
