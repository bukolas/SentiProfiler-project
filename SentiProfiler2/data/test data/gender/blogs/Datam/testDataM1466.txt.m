Who ever thought up daylight savings time should be punished in cruel and unusual ways. This just helps prove that I am not and never will be a ‘morning person’ Tanks to Endless Supra for the great photo. Finally I am starting a new project that I have been waiting to do for a long time. I am calling it the "4-5" table because I was lucky enough to obtain two planks of solid Elm that were the 4th and 5th sequential cuts (of 15) from a large local fallen Elm tree. The 3x3 post pictured are maple. The grain it amazing and I plan to work in the natural exposed edge to the design. I am really excited about this one. Pheasant Hunting in Brown city this Morning. Cold wet and muddy. Perfect. But: Thanks to Christoph Niemann for the artwork. I just recieved a really dumb email. It's so many kinds of wrong I feel like I should take the sender aside and spend the time to explain why. The problem with email is it allows people to spread stupid at the speed of the Internet. Sometimes I feel like I am fighting a blizzard of dumb with a plastic spoon of common sense. Aka a glimpse at how my mind works: (to myself) What is today? 3/11? I like 3/11’s music I really need to sort out my music library. I never did by a 2nd drive to back up my back up drive. I think my ‘membership’ for ecost expired. Expired? I never did put the registration stickers on the plane. I have to get out to the hanger soon. The weather is nice finally, but is supposed to rain. I hope it does not rain went I go hunting this weekend. Am I going to be able to hunt with my thumb bandaged up? Better call Ron and talk to him. Where did I put those Filson pants? Shit I have to cut the wood for the shelves the Girl wanted before I go. I really want to start on that shop project. I have to call Mike about the welding stuff. What time is it? Craptastic… I’m running late. Things I am so not interested in: Anything that is on TV right now. The Kitty's fleeting inerest in sitting in my lap. Anything with teen vampires. More cold weather. Going to work tomorow.
