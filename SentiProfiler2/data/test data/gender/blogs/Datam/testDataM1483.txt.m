It was a great experience and I have to thank Andreas Mitisek and the Long Beach Opera for allowing me to photograph behind the scenes of one of their recent rehearsals. Now, that being said, the person I owe the biggest thanks to is my favorite flautist, Teri Christian (aka FlutePrayer, who writes the blog, FlutePrayer ). I met Teri and her husband, Bob, through blogging and I've gotten to enjoy a couple of the performances (Opera and Municipal Band) they've been involved with down in Long Beach (Yay, Long Beach). I've been trying to work it out to to shoot one of the Long Beach Opera performances for quite a while. Teri has been the one working on getting me the okay to come in and snap away. I really hope I wasn't too much of a distraction. That was my biggest concern while shooting (well, that and also that I might suck at being a still photographer). No worries. Things seemed to work out fine. The orchestra and the all the performers had their game faces on and I did my best to ninja my way through the rehearsal. (Whoooo-WHA-KAI! Click, Click, Click! KI-YAAA!) God bless the Christians. (Heh-heh, doesn't that sound kind of redundant?) Our story was all about the coming boom in 3D entertainment technology.&nbsp; I was working with Dave Malkoff (who should really consider spelling his name M-a-l-k-o-v because that would be totally retro mad scientist sci-fi). &nbsp; We started in Burbank, shot an interview and b-roll for the piece, then drove over to the Burbank entertainment center to look for a good liveshot spot. We couldn't find a spot. Well, actually we found plenty of spots.&nbsp; Just none that would give us anything visually related to the story we were working.&nbsp; So, since we weren't going to be on TV until the later shows, we figured we should have plenty of time to dash over to LA Live. A good plan in theory. After battling crazy Friday evening traffic, we finally made it to a good spot for a liveshot.&nbsp; We set up just to the North side of the Regal Theaters. Right next to the psychic's office.&nbsp; Office?&nbsp; Hmm, what would you call it? Anyway, we managed to cut a piece that touted the coming wave of home 3D entertainment.&nbsp; No liveshot after all.&nbsp; We needed to be back to the station before the end of my shift and I needed to do that without hitting the station with a meal penalty. So, it wasn't the most action packed exciting night at work for me.&nbsp; Still, there's this one thing that I wanted to mention.&nbsp; I wanted to say just how cool it is to see parts of LA that most people don't even know about. Take Mr. Sippee for example. You might never have the opportunity (or logical reason) to try fried chicken sold at a gas station.&nbsp; Heck, right minds would tend to avoid something like that. Not me.&nbsp; But, then again, I did qualify that (yeah, right minds). Quick history: I first found Mr. Sippee during the 1984 Olympics (held in Los Angeles, if you remember).&nbsp; I was just out of school and working for ABC Sports.&nbsp; I don't remember why I stopped here, but ever since then, every few years, I manage to grab some chicken and their broasted potatoes. It's not exactly good, but it does take me back to a simpler time in my younger days. I can remember when I used eat junk like that and enjoy it.&nbsp; I'm glad I've grown up a little since then.&nbsp; I'm older and smarter and. . . (sigh) Okay, let me have one leg and thigh combo with potatoes, to go. Blogged with the Flock Browser It's not an excuse for not posting (Come on, Blogging is never having to say, I'm sorry!), but truthfully, it's been a difficult couple of weeks for me. You know, sometimes the postings are slow because I don't have much to say.&nbsp; Sometimes they're slow because nothing much interesting is happening. Sometimes they're slow because I'm dealing with things that don't leave me a lot of space to compose my thoughts in any form fit to share. That being said, today I'm trying to catch up on some the assignments I've had the last couple of weeks. Last Monday night, I found myself in a SAT truck covering a candlelight&nbsp; vigil for Amber Dubois. There were thousands of people crowded into the courtyard of Escondido High School.&nbsp; The vigil had started about 6:30pm.&nbsp; I was about twenty minutes too late to catch the beginning by the time I arrived. It's a long drive from North Hollywood during the afternoon rush hour, but I had a pretty good idea of the route.&nbsp; I'd passed through Escondido a week prior when I'd been assigned to cover the search for Chelsea King. Lots of time travelling there and back to think about things. Anyway, it was another couple of hours before things slowed enough for me to pull my DSLR out to snap a few still shots. By then vigil was over and most of the people had gone.&nbsp; So, right then it wasn't exactly me alone with my thoughts, but it was far fewer than had been there just an hour or so earlier. There was a sadness that hung over the area. I believe we are the sum total of the things we experience.&nbsp; Doing what I do as a news photographer I get to witness more grief than most people. Sometimes it's easier than others to keep that sadness from becoming my own.&nbsp; It's a struggle.&nbsp; Sometimes I win. Sometimes I don't. Blogged with the Flock Browser I wish this wasn't a part of my day. I'm running SNG for the Orange County bureau at the Amber Dubois memorial. Monsters do exist in our world. Stories like this happen and I know it's true. Posted via email from beFrank's posterous I'm not working the Oscars this weekend, so maybe I'll take some time to actually go to the movies.&nbsp; Either I haven't been motivated to see much this year or there really hasn't been much I've wanted to see. I kind of think it was that second thing.&nbsp; Also, I've been pretty busy with work (don't get me started on the family stuff). Way back last Monday, I got sent down to San Diego to follow the night search activities in the Chelsea King disappearance.&nbsp; She was still missing at the time.&nbsp; An initial arrest had been made, but her body hadn't been found yet. It was pretty grim.&nbsp; Sure, all the news people talked and socialized a bit in the area where we were all parked.&nbsp; Still, it just seemed like a dark and depressive evening. We were pretty close to the same area where David Westerfield and the parents of Danielle Van Dam lived.&nbsp; Danielle Van Dam was a nine year old girl that Westerfield was convicted of abducting and murdering. Reporter Greg Mills and I had a simple story to put together for the ten and eleven o'clock newscasts.&nbsp; There wasn't much to see from the media area that had been set up.&nbsp; There also weren't a lot of people around to question. Most of the people we had access to were friends and family of the missing girl and for the most part they weren't willing to be interviewed on camera. That makes our job a lot more difficult. One friend of the family told us off-camera that they were still holding out hope that Chelsea would be found alive. I learned the next day that Chelsea's body had been recovered from a shallow grave near the area of the search. That was my Monday. It's been a week of ups and downs. I'm still standing, but very happy that today is Friday.&nbsp; I see an ice cold beer in my future. Blogged with the Flock Browser Just a quick update. I'm in Hollywood hoping for a celebrity or two. Covering arrivals at a "green" carpet event. Posted via email from beFrank's posterous While passing through Temecula on the way to a story that will not likely end well, we saw this at a gas station. It made me smile. I'm thankful for that. I'm guessing there won't be many more of those tonight. -- Sent from my BlackBerry Posted via email from beFrank's posterous It's been a busy week.&nbsp; I&nbsp; could be posting a bit more, but most of the things I'd be inclined to write about aren't really news or photography related. Just so you know where I've been and what I've been working on, I'll try to post a few pictures and do some small bit of writing to put things in context. These shots were taken out at Huntington Beach because the city decided to remove a bunch of the fire pits that line the beach. I was working with Suzie Suh that night and I'll be honest.&nbsp; I didn't think we were going to find anybody out using the fire pits.&nbsp; The weather forecast was calling for rain, plus it's winter.&nbsp; Who in their right mind heads down to the beach in the rain in the cold of winter? No people?&nbsp; That would have made the story a bit more difficult to cover. As you can see from the previous pictures, there were people out making fires. The rain didn't hit as hard as I thought it might, but I did get caught by a light sprinkle. The rain chased away most of the bon fire bugs.&nbsp; We were left with drunken young people who might not have been old enough to be out drinking. At least they stayed close to their fire and pretty much ignored us. I'm kind of glad we were out doing this story now and that it wasn't a warm summer night.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we would have gotten more attention if that were the case. It was too cold and wet to screw with the media. Blogged with the Flock Browser
