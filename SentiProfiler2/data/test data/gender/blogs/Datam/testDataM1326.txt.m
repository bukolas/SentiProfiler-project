I spent the next eight years reading everything I could about tribal people who lived in the deserts, mountains and jungles of the world. In 2005, after living in Argentina for five months, I was finally granted the opportunity to realise my dream by visiting a remote tribe in the Javari Basin of the Amazon Rainforest on the border between Peru in Brazil. After that I was hooked. In 2006 I visited nomads living in the remotest part of the Moroccan Atlas mountains. In 2007 I spent a month traveling independently in West Papua on the island of New Guinea then a week on Siberut, one of Indonesia's Mentawai Islands. My aim has been, wherever possible, to learn some lingua franca before I visit tribal groups so that I can visit them without a guide and can communicate directly with them myself. My style of travel on all of these trips could best be described as neither sight-seeing, backpacking or exploring but more just trying to understand different ways of thinking and viewing life and the world.
