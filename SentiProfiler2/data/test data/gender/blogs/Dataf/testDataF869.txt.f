Well, first up, HELLO WORLD! haha!
I never thought i would be one of those people to "blog", but here I am and it will mostly be about the goings-on in my television career here in the United States.
I will be posting links, videos, photos and try to reach as many people as possibly, for I am a woman on a mission: To host the brand new X Factor that will be airing on Fox in the fall of 2011. Simon Cowell is leaving American Idol this year, and will be bringing the new generation talent-show juggernaut that is X Factor, to the US!
I know it is over a year away, but that gives me more time to create and spread as MUCH hype as possibly, because isn't that what this little world wide web is for?!
Make sure to check out my myspace and you can see some of the awesome TV work I have been lucky enough to be involved in, as well as a few videos: www.myspace.com/ashakwork

Ciao for now my lovelies! I don't know who you are, but thank you for visiting my page. Spread the love!
