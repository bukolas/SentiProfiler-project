14 x 5" About five years back, when I was just starting to paint, I emailed a well-known artist and asked him to take a look at my work and tell me what I was missing. He offered one comment that stuck with me - to pay as much attention to the edges as the content. I was too tight - too illustrative. And it's not what I wanted to achieve - I wanted to find the balance of details needed and leave the rest to impression. With each and every painting, I have to pay great attention to that fine line - not to say there are days when I desire to tighten up and other times I desire to really lay on the painterly strokes. I don't have a favorite feature in this new piece - I love all of it. That final dab of light blue on the bathing suit mattered, although I don't know what made me do it other than intuition. The edges are just as I want - allowing some to be rough and some soft.

There's plenty of room to not only get up close, but to back up a good 30 - 40 feet and take it all in. When I was a teenager, I would sit on the floor in front of this masterpiece and draw dozens of versions of parts of this urban scene - not knowing I'd paint it dozens of times thirty years later. My favorite feature of this new piece is the man on the far right, on his way out. I have wanted to add more movement in figures - a slight blur or even a ghost of a shape - just knowing when it's right is the tough part. And knowing how to get the idea across, without looking like my hand smudged the paint unintentionally is even harder. It's something I'm working on more and more, mostly behind the scenes.

The two figures were wonderful to paint, especially the woman who has that great S-shaped posture. Included front and center is Georgia O'Keeffe's 'Black Cross, New Mexico', one of my all-time personal favorites in the Art Institute of Chicago.

And remember, brighter days are ahead. Not soon enough - but it's coming. My first thought about this new painting is it can best be appreciated in person. The vibrancy of the skin tones, the yellow towel and especially the turquoise water and multi-blues sky - the texture and warmth in the sand, which I used a palette knife for most of that - yes, I wish I could hold up the real thing right in front of you. As with most paintings. In the process of painting this, I did the figure first, the water next, the people walking about and in the ocean way in the distance - and then wiped the whole thing off. Those moments are funny - here I just spent hours on what I thought was nearly complete and it's as if my hand just took over and grabbed a rag and, in seconds, trashed it. So I sit there stunned for a minute, hearing that little voice that assures me it wasn't right and get over it. Just as quick as it disappeared, I start it all over again - lessons learned - which usually makes the second attempt much more successful.

It's been an obsession since I was a kid - watching the human figure and studying how we move, stand, balance, sit ...... all of it. And when I start a painting, there's always something that stands out right away - a feature that is essentially why I'm interested in the photograph in the first place. In this case, I saw this gentleman and his clothes as one united, interesting form - I felt the weight of the fabric, the heavy load of the backpack and especially the zigzags created by the folds of the pants. I just love that feature. I also saw the warmth of the overall tones - the golds, reds, greys - and chose to paint a rich, paprika-like color on top of the black surface I usually start with and hoped it would peek through in parts as long as I didn't go too far and cover it all up. The challenge being to let the edges do what they do, without nit picking. Like here in the legs ..... I was so happy with the some of the red showing through the creamy wall and the looseness of the shadows around the Picasso - again allowing edges to overlap and disappear into each other. That's what I get when I stay away from small brushes - I'm forced to take more control of the strokes but I can't over-paint it. This young man was studying Picasso's 'Mother and Child', which hangs in the Modern Wing in the Art Institute of Chicago. Please click here for a larger view and purchase information. Booster Seat I and II each is 8 x 10" Whew ! All of the new paintings are officially in the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery , currently being hung for the three-artists-show opening Friday, the 26th and I feel I can relax a little bit. And I'm very happy to start showing you each and every painting - and if you don't mind - I want to add to that some of my favorite details or 'sweet spots' that make them special. Let me start with the paintings you see above - two women taking a rest on a bench in the Art Institute of Chicago. It's where thousands of visitors take a load off and hopefully get a boost of energy to get back to exploring. Now, you may recognize the woman on the right, I had painted her a few years back - but with this new piece, actually both paintings - I applied the oils with a palette knife, nice and thick, then carved into it with a brush, adding more detail and control. I can attest to this being more difficult and frustrating - but the challenge lies in moving the paint around, almost sculpting it in parts. Some areas have slabs of color on top of color, like in the pants and the back wall and the swirling of thick paint to move with the folds of the clothes. You may also notice, even though I'm one of three artists in this show, I titled my work "The Tute and a Tan". Let me explain how my brain works, with respect to getting the job done. I can move forward, fairly quick, if I have a specific direction. In this case, I chose to paint scenes from two of my favorite people-watching spots - the Art Institute of Chicago aka the 'Tute' - and the beach. Once I can visualize a grouping that marries well with each other, I start working. There isn't an artist that doesn't get stuck not knowing what to paint next - and this way of thinking and preparing helps me motivate. All of my paintings in the show can be viewed here - and thank you for looking. A short video can be viewed here as well. Hope you enjoy. 'Cruise Control' sold This might be a workshop meant for you - my second Field Expedition this year taking place November 1st - 5th at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I've seen the studio space, it's fabulous - and like the New York City workshop, we'll be painting in the early part of the day and photographing in the afternoons. I picked this location because it has provided me with loads of imagery for paintings - the beach, the low-country landscapes and Savannah and Charleston are near enough for a short road trip for more. Also, the fine people at the Morris &amp; Whiteside Gallery will be hosting an evening get-together at their gallery for our group and you may also be interested in scooting over to Charleston after the workshop is over, for their Palette and Palate Stroll during the weekend. Should be great fun. More information can be found here and you can call Vince Fazio at the Sedona Arts Center for further details and registration. 6 x 6" oil on masonite sold I am sure there's many of you out there that aren't embracing the snow right now. But remember, I live in the deep south, and this is not only a rare occurrence, it's an unusual opportunity for me to paint something different, and I love that. It is staggering to see my world blanketed in white - almost no hint of color anywhere - the muted, silver sky - the amazing quiet. If it wasn't for my slipping on the ice and dropping my camera right smack in the snow, I would say that day was a perfect day. I also get to play with thick, blended, warm and cool white paints - laid on thick and as heavy as the snow itself. So much fun. And I promise - the 18 new paintings you'll see in a few weeks will warm you up and remind you that brighter days are ahead.
