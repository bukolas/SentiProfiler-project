First off I was finally convinced to no longer us IE and now I am using chrome and everything is weird and off and the fonts are all screwing with me. Yes, I am late to the party on this .. one of those, I don't like change and I like fire fox even less. So here we are. Not that I ever claimed to know anything about computers, technology or fonts. All I know is that everyone seems to hate comic sans, I now get made fun of for talking pictures with an actual camera and not an i-phone and I am still freaked out by using skype.


Secondly I am finally getting around to reading Julie and Julia. I love her (Julie), I and I am terribly sad I didn't read it before I saw the movie. But whats done is done. The thing is that it does not make me want to blog more but it makes me what to get rid of this entirely. Which leads me to thirdly.

Thirdly I am really started to get irritated with my addiction..errr, facebook. So maybe I should come over here and say all the status I want to have because I am no longer comfortable over there. Mostly because at how angry some people make me. Defriending is not an option. Well, its always an option but I don't need more drama in this area then is already there. And now "hide" isn't working for one person in particular. They creep into my day, UN WELCOMED, and make me all pissy and unhappy and negative. And I am sick of being that person.

Fourth, fourthly? ..... look, I am sorry for those people in Haiti, really sorry, I have donated what I can to the Red Cross, I have sat in horror of seeing those images on the tv. But people comparing the generosity of us giving to charities over this to the health care debacle in congress is a stretch at the very least. The two are in no way comparable. Moving on, I just wanted to get my feelings out on that.

Fifth, the weather is beautiful here. I refuse to fight my child to get him outside. Perhaps we'd all be better with some sun in our faces. I for one am ready for sitting out on the patio with a beer, with something cooking on the grill. But, I am not yet ready for this nice weather. I would appreciate if it went away till the end of February ... there was something comforting about the cold and being stuck inside during this particular time for our household. I am sure that only makes sense to me.
