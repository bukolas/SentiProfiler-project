to rndssis: I have early onset PD, was diagnosed in 98, and am progressing very slowly. The reason for that, I believe, is that I primarily treat my PD with anti oxidants, including CoQ10, and Cranberry Extract. Also, I delayed taking Sinemet as long as possible, and if I were you, I'd get off it right away! It makes the symptoms better but helps the disease progress because it metabolizes into a chemical that actually kills off the mitochondria in brain cells with oxidative stress! If I were you, I'd try Comtan (slows down the breakdown of dopamine) and one of the dopamine agonists (I take Mirapex, tried Requip but it made me sick). Even though your neurolgist won't like this (If he won't do it, get him to prescribe Sinemet too, and just don't take it), beleive me, you will progress a lot more slowly!
