..This morning I feel like someone ran over me with a Semi while I was looking somewhere else.  I didn't do anything yesterday to deserve all of this misery and the Sun is shining so my mood should be good.  Even the hair on my head feels like someone is trying to break it in half.  I did not have a good nights sleep but I could not figure out why I kept waking up about every hour and a half.  Even the coffee this morning does not clear my head.  I hope this clears up soon as we are heading down to Chicago tomorrow morning to visit with the middle daughter and introduce the Brown dog to where she is going to spend the month of April while we head out to Arizona for the muddy season.  I was looking forward to our upcoming trip but I sure don't want to start it feeling like this.  Even typing is painful as the hands feel more like hot burning lead and do not get better with usage.  I think I will go dip them in hot coffee.  Later
