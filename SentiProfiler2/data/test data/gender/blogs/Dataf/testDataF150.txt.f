My mind feels like a bowl of noodles these days! So many thoughts entwined, none really leading to anywhere! And it’s difficult to pick up and talk about one...they just keep breaking! 

There’s work, where my honeymoon period is over...and now there’s real stuff to deal with. The settling down bit which I don’t think I’ve ever done before. 

There’s life as I knew it – travelling, blogging, photography and so much more...part of which I want again.

There’s life as I’ve never known before, all thanks to somebody new. It’s a trance like state; I seem to have lost touch with everything else! And I am definitely not complaining!!!

There are surprises every day, and so many stories to tell, which I hope I soon will :)

For now I have decided to pick up the chopsticks and enjoy this bowl of sweet confusion!!!
