Shaun White is 23 years-old now but only 11 in that clip, same age as my daughter. And – AND! – he was born with a heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries before he turned one. Despite that inauspicious beginning, he started snowboarding when he was six, won his second gold medal in these Vancouver Games, and is the acknowledged master of the sport. Ever watch him compete? With the other snowboarders, both his own American teammates and the riders from other countries, there is sometimes a stiffness in their routines, a nervous quality that comes across even on television. Incredible athletes all, and snowboarding tricks in general demand an uncommon kind of bravery and audacity of movement, but Shaun White's fluidity almost makes them look wooden in comparison. When he goes on, he appears to be just playing. His performance is all, “Hey guys, gonna have a little fun here now, k?” as he bounces around the halfpipe and, in the tradition of all athletes at the top of their game, makes it look easy.
