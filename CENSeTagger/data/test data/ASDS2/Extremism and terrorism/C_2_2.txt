Wa alaykum assalaam, The sheikh (r.a.) was a shaheed, insha'Allah. It was his son who used the martydom belt, the sheikh was shot to death. I have posted a video in the new related video section of his burial. May God accept Sheikh Abu Noor from amongst the Shuhada and grant him Jannat al-Firdaws. Insha'Allah there will be Jihad until Shariah or Shahadah.
