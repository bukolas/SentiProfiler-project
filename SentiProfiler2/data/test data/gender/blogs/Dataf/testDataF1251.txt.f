So many times in life mom had come across groups of individuals who would come and advise her on how to do things. Then another will say whatever she had been doing would be wrong and that she has to start over. At different points in time in life. Now there are people that tell me that I should not be on this blogging/tweeting scene and that there should be more exclusivity. And that a musician needs to maintain the distance. Sometimes I feel that they are right. Considering some comments I get, I wonder why people are so obsessed with obscenities and the related but why should I be subject to all this is their question. Yes it does make sense several times. But if and when I don't blog, it would perhaps be because I have tired of this medium of expression and there would be a proper goodbye. I don't see it happening for now but the thing is, no matter what you do, there will be tons of free advice. And in Oscar Wilde's words "I alwayspass on good advice. It's the only thing to do with it. It is never any use to oneself."Â
