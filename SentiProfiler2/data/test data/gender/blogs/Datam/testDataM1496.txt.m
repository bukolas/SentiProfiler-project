(Click for Closeup) To launch the online magazine Ekleksographia Wave Two: William Blake and the Mad Tea Party (edited by Philip Davenport), the artist Sarah Sanders performed an online writing event "for 24 hours from sunrise on Monday 15th March through to the following sunrise on Tuesday 16th March 2010." On her website, she wrote that "This is a one off event and no documentation will be made." Actually, that's not quite true. I left the live video stream going for about an hour while I caught up on some online reading tonight, and I snapped a few screenshots of her writing in action. For the most part, nothing happened. Sanders was nearing the end of a twenty-four hour marathon, and she must of been tired, so all I could see was a slight moundlike bit of paper, maybe a loose sheet, maybe bound into a book. I could tell that pencil marks had been made on it in lines, but little else. The wall behind it looked like the sky, so the still picture I saw seemed a landscape, of words. Occasionally, though, Sanders would appear on screen and begin some frantic scribbling onto that sheet of paper with a nub of a pencil. She was (and actually is) writing a sentences or sentences. Syntax is flowing through her words, and I've enjoyed watching her write, watching the physical act of writing. And I'm happy to document this in this quite modest way, to remember a day of writing. Just now, just before midnight (Eastern Daylight Savings Time), I watched her closely enough to read a short string of words. This is difficult to do because the camera is frozen in a closeup of the page when she writes, and she moves the paper violently back and force when she does. But I saw her write this string of words: "long till sunrise." She wonders, it seems, how long it is till sunrise, and she longs for it, because at sunrise she can sleep. She has about an hour and a half to go by my figuring. Sleep well, Sarah. ecr. l'inf. See a seen. A shape inviolate of wonder often has possi bilities unthought.

I had almost forgotten that today was Pi Day, so I had almost forgotten to write my piem. If I had, I would have been asleep before midnight tonight, because I am just back from a trip to Purchase, New York, where Nancy and I saw our son Tim and a play he’s been working on. The trip down there was complicated by hundreds of downed trees. It took us an extra hour to find a way to make it the last four minutes to campus. We were impressed by the destruction: huge trees pushed onto their sides by high winds, power lines over us slouching downward under the weight of trees leaning into them, and leaning trees pulling themselves out of the earth. A day after the storm, many roads remained unpassable. So I would not have minded not having a poem to work on once we made it home late tonight. But I had a poem to write, so I did. ecr. l’inf.

The new issue of Ekleksographia online magazine ‘William Blake and the Naked Teaparty’ guest edited by Philip Davenport features textworks that emphasise the touch - handwrit and haptic – particularly pieces that consider emotional engagements, human space - that weird trace and corporate/military erasure of the handmade, the human touch, the not-digital. These qualities link into the alternative tradition of poetics - and to 'outsider' artists who are owed a debt by the experimenters (an IOU all the way back to Will Blake, he and the Mrs sitting on the lawn in London afternoons, naked, drinking tea).

My copy of the book was born on the 18th of January of this year in Charleston, South Carolina, and I find it somehow soothing that I know exactly when it was born and that I've read it this year. The book is Elizabeth Bryant's (nevertheless enjoyment , which is an opening that is eventually closed. But during the course of it—which, if anything, is too short—the book works its way through the bittersweet music of living a life, without devolving into something maudlin or untrue. The book is of a piece, a set of short prose poems that think through what a live might be or is. I know Elizabeth, so I have to note that I may have some bias in her favor. After a poetry reading last night, Nancy and I went out to dinner at the only Mexican restaurant in Tivoli, New York, with Elizabeth and Anne Gorrick, Lynn Behrendt, and Reb Livingston. But my response to her poetry is not so much about her as about her words. Even last night, speaking on a different subject, I noted that my interest wasn't in poets per se (except as purveyors of words), but in poems. (nevertheless enjoyment is a book of tiny prose poems that almost resemble the story of a woman's life, except that they represent, instead, merely brief moments and considerations in such a life. They hold together because of the tone of the language, their focus on the personal aspects of life (over the professional or even the poetic), and the feel of them. These are not necessarily sad poems, but they are restrained in their emotion. These are flashing fragments of stories that are occasionally somber yet always tinged with a sense or reality, something strangely missing from most poems I read these days. It seems to me that the best review I can ever provide is to list the lines and phrases that I find startling in a poem, but that is actually inadequate. It eviscerates the poems in any book, but it's particularly problematic with this one. Elizabeth builds her poems through the accumulation of phrases. She doesn't write so much in sentences as in phrases, in wholes that might seem to be fragments of a thought. But this is the source of her poems' rhetorical power. These concatenated phrases sometimes propel the putative narrative forward and sometimes send it off course, set it askew, ask the reader to understand the inevitable surprise of life. For these are living poems about living life. Geof Huth Reads Selections from Elizabeth Bryant's (nevertheless enjoyment To understand these poems, and to hear them, I actually taped a few of them, trying to learn to speak in their serious and languid manner. As I did, I sometimes heard the failing of my inner ear to hear the rhythm and syntax of these poems, but also to hear their delicate beauty. For these are not showy poems at all. The language is simple, the syntax is straightforward, and it is the rhetoric of the poems that propels them forward. The poems make arguments about relationships, perception, living, and it is that sense of needing to speak out a life (though done almost totally drained of emotion) is what moves these poems forward. And one of the rhetorical tricks of these poems is to stop a poem in its tracks, to insert a phrase that makes us rethink the entire enterprise. I can't adequately express the beauty of these poems, not even by speaking them aloud to you, so let me add two more notes about these poems. First, each has a title that ends with a closing parenthesis even though it does not begin with and opening one. What this simple act of titling tells us is that the opening of the title of each poem is actually the title of the book itself, so the short poem "of a head smacked in afterthought)" is actually the end of a title that begins "(nevertheless enjoyment." This tells us a story, one possibly about loss, one about imperfection, about life. We are told that things might go wrong, but that still there is enjoyment in life, that our lives our guided by our ability to see that enjoyment. Second, this is a visual book in one almost subtle way. This is actually a flipbook. Because, as we read through the book, each subsequent poem is a step lower than the others on the page. The poem is a movement downwards, in terms of feeling. But in terms of poetry, this is a work of restrained beauty and depth. Just the book we need. _____ Bryant, Elizabeth. (nevertheless enjoyment . Quale Press: np, 2010. ecr. l'inf At work this week, a single line in a single document four of us were working on transformed into a minor controversy that raged for a couple of days and pushed the completion of that tiny project off for just as long. Afterwards, the person who had asked the question that set off this asked me how something so small could have such a great effect. My answer, as it always is, is that the smallest things matter most. For that reason, I'm glad that endwar has a new chapbook out from Naissance at chapbookpublisher.com . endwar is a hyperminimalist poet, someone interested in the hugeness of the tiniest effects, someone interested in purity and the way in which language can be completely turned on its head by the movement of a single letter. These are poems for the hyperliterate as well, poems for people with a deep interest in the word and the word especially as a field of action for thought. (I do need to admit that I've "published" a few of these poems before both on this blog and via my tiny little micropress, dbqp, so my interest in this book and these poems is, in some way personal. And the personal continues, because a number of these poems closely resemble or are exactly identical to poems I've written, including a few poems in my recent book ntst . But these are only a few poems, because endwar's imagination is a bit different from mine, and it is in those poems, the ones I never could have imagined into existence myself, that I see his best work.) One of the best poems in this book, one reproduced on the publisher's website, and one uncharacteristically romantic is ( my hand remembers the shape of your hand ) Working with the visual pun of the parenthesis as a hand, because he always works with the pun, endwar writes what seems to me one of the greatest love poems (if such a thing is possible) I've ever read, something delicate, human, and quietly beautiful, and something restrained, not a cry of joy or melancholy, merely a statement, bolstered by emotion that is hidden yet still real. Many of these poems are great little pwoermds, instances of insight that come and go but that continue to resonate: everyhere eare rhthmh Very few pwoermdists have this level of control, such surprising control of the DNA of written language, this ability to produce meaning by the addition, subtraction, or repetition of a single language, but this is the way that endwar words, and carefully. He doesn't produce huge quantities of these tiny poems of his, but those he does are almost all surprisingly fresh and satisfying. A few of his poems are only a few words long a[tom b]bomb some are based on naming the punctuation marks the thorn , and none are more than a dozen words long, because endwar is not a narrator, not a storyteller. He is a creator of instants designed to awaken our minds and to make us see the world of words before us. Without poets like endwar to show us the surprises of language that sit constantly before us, that language would be invisible to us, something that exists, that we might even use well, but something we would never see for itself. endwar deconstructs our entire system of written communication, and he does it by moving language around carefully, as a scientist might use a pipette to move the tiniest bit of animal matter to another spot on the same petri dish in order to see what changes would result. _____ endwar. Open your I . Naissance: np, 2009. US$10. ecr. l'inf. I watched twenty-two movies tonight, though (admittedly) at least one of them was under a minute long, and Stan Brakhage is certainly a poet with film, or was, and a couple of his films are clearly filmpoems. There is a reason that his brand of filmmaking was occasionally called the poetic cinema. His films are beautiful, personal, revelatory, and sometimes the smallest of them—certainly Moth Light , even the almost instantaneous Eye Myth —can shake you awake. Tonight was a night that left little time for poetry, but what there was I took. I sat down on my couch with Volume I of The Collected Poems of Larry Eigner , and I read a few dozen more pages into it. I’m going slowly, but I’m enjoying the instants of pleasure in his early work, where he’s trying to hone his craft, and sometimes only succeeding in writing a startling phrase, a perfect instant. It is always the instants that matter, the smallest bits of perceptible experience that matter. So I might wonder why I don’t worry much about margins. Beneath my posting last night about Larry Eigner’s Collected Poems , John Bloomberg-Rissman asked me, Did you see Steven Fama's post about this set? He's got serious problems with the way the edition’s laid out; he thinks it puts the lie to the editors' claims of fidelity. I believe 23 comments follow, some from Curtis F, one of the editors. I wonder what you think of all this, from the visual poet's point of view? Originally, I had begun to comment back to John, but my comment became too long to be a comment, so I’ve worked it into this: I read that posting, but not until today. I was a couple of entries behind on Steven Fama’s blog, which I have to say is always interesting, passionate, and full of good information. In the blog entry in question , Steven argues that the editors of Eigner’s collected (Curtis Faville and Robert Grenier) ruined Eigner’s poems by printing them flush left instead of a few inches to the right of the margin, as Eigner often did in his typescripts. He argued that Eigner meant for the poems to be floating in white space and to do something else, as they had, ruined the integrity of the poems. I have to say Steven is certainly correct, to a degree. I think most of the poems would look bett
r floating in white space. And we could argue that that was Eigner's intention. Most of the time. But I’d say Steven has exaggerated the issue. I had already scanned through the book by the time I'd read this, so I'd determined that no other good solution was possible. In Eigner's later poems, especially, he tended to use more and more of the page, making the affordance of a three-inch left margin impossible if you wanted to maintain the textual interrelations of text within the poems themselves. For examples, see “starry figures,” IV:1598; “was will be,” IV:1612, and, most obviously, “there’s a season,” IV:1684-1685. With a three-inch margin on the left, these poems would be off the page or reformatted out of existence. These examples are not numerous, but they show that Eigner had to drastically narrow the left-hand margin in some cases just to accommodate the poems, which argues that the wide left margin was not an essential characteristic of the poems but a convenience considering the general narrowness of his poems. (For instance, I tend to center individual poems of my own on a page, but if I lay them out into a book, I move them to some left-hand margin I define.) To me the left margin has no particular essence to it, because the essence is within the atomized cloud of words. The page is just the holder. Most of Eigner’s poems are not what I’d call visual poems, but they nearly are. They are what I call visualized poems, poems with a significant and important visual presence, but ones still focused on words over text. One solution to allow for three-inch-or-better margins would be to reduce the type size, but the type is already small enough. And their size replicates the size of Eigner’s own type, allowing for a sense of how he put his word clouds together. (My argument, stretching this metaphor a bit, is that a beautiful cloud is itself, separably beautiful. It is not beautiful necessarily because of its placement in the sky.) Another solution would be to start poems at different distances from the left-hand margin, which would be unsightly, a typographical mess. I’ve done this myself before, and it leads to visual chaos that doesn’t seem useful to me. So the only other solution I can think of would be to go to a landscape oriented page, which had nothing to do with how Larry operated and which would require cutting individual poems across two pages, thus ruining the intentional mise en page of his usually one page or shorter poems. The decisions Curtis Faville and Bob Grenier made in this book seem to me to be the right ones. The decision about where to begin the poems is, simply, the only one. So, sure, the poems go pretty deep into the crevice of the left-hand margin, but this problem is obviated to some degree by the fact of the almost-constantly available white space on the facing verso page, which still gives the illusion of the poems floating in space. Not as much, not as well, but as well as could be expected. What's most important in an Eigner poem, typographically, is not the left-hand margin; it is the interrelations of the words in the typographic gridspace, and this is what these volumes maintain, going so far as to preserve every instance of double spaces between two words, though I remain unsure that these are always intentional and meaningful typographic instants. Also, as the book itself demonstrates through reproductions of typescripts, Eigner often squeezed multiple poems onto a page in a reasonably messy way. (See the cover of volume IV.) Is this, then, meant to be an instruction to future editors to crowd those poems onto the page? I think not. And Faville and Grenier, in this instance, have pushed the fourth poem, reasonably, I'd say, onto the next page. If you look at Eigner’s typescripts, you can see that most are messes of one kind or another, to one degree or another. They are workspaces. They are the workshop in which he created his poems, though not the poems themselves. The poems do not require the scribbled notations of Eigner’s, the stuffing of extra poems onto the page, or even the common but not constant wide left-hand margins. Even though I love those myself. I find it interesting that Fama presents a reproduction of the final page of the book From the Sustaining Air as an example of how to do things. I'd say it is not. First, the poem really has no title besides its first line. That heavy title hanging over the poem (and essentially segregated from the poem because it is flush left while the poem is center-right), is awkward, unnecessary, and improperly capitalized. And the adherence to the extra-wide margin merely throws the poem awkwardly off-center on this narrower-than-letter-size page. This is all wrong, and this is early in Eigner's career, before his visual effects became more fluid, and more essential. This is a pre-visualized poem, one of those that preceded Eigner's real greatness (though this is a stunningly great poem and one of my favorites—maybe the title of my blog posting from last night gives that away. I wonder if the final versions of the poems developed by Grenier and Eigner together (their names, I'll note again, are almost anagrammatic, as if they were almost the same person) actually complied constantly to this three-inch-or-fatter margin. I doubt so, since it's just not possible for all the poems. But Grenier could tell us. And Grenier lived with Eigner for quite a few years, so it’s likely he understood Eigner better than those of us who know him only as words on a page. I've just started reading this book. It is four large volumes long, and I have much more to read, and I'm reading the entirety of the book in sequential order, so I'll pause occasionally through this experiment to record a few thoughts here, about the poems, about their development, about their visual effects, and about Eigner as a visual or nearly-visual poet, of the first order. ecr. l’inf. Every book, it now seems to me, is completely inconceivable to us until it lay in our hands. I have tried to use pictures to understand what the monstrous publishing project The Collected Poems of Larry Eigner really is, but they led me astray. The picture available anywhere shows the front cover, but only of the first volume of four—and each volume is illustrated with a different image, except that each image is of the same typescript of a single poem of Eigner's. For the covers are the frames of a movie that moves in slow motion, as slowly as our eyes cross over the covers, as slowly as they recognize the repetition. The first frame is illustrated by two exploded words, two lines of text, "calligraphy/typewriters." If we know Eigner, we know of his severe palsy, how he typed his poems for decades with one finger and one thumb with a typewriter, and we know that the typewriter is his way of writing. If we know Eigner, we know that he worked his poems, slowly, methodically, across the field of the page, and we know that his poems were all about the mise en page, so we might guess how his determined typing was the only calligraphy he could have, that the machine itself and the invisible gridspace it worked upon were the fingers of his calligrapher's hand. The second frame pulls back—each frame pulls back a bit more from the last—to reveal what seems to be the opening of a poem, one of these telegraphic diagonals via which Eigner learned to communicate. We begin with writing ("calligraphy/typewriters"), then move into an image of his hat (I pause here to announce, as I always do, that "Huth" means "hat"), which is followed quickly by a "bureau" encased in parentheses. His hat, maybe, is within his bureau. And that is where, and in his writing ("calligraphy/typewriters") is where, and in his head (thus under his hat) is where "the world/inside/spins." When we pull back far enough to see the third frame, we see that this poem that we may have imagined continuing beyond "spins" has come to a stop, that that was the entire poem, something about writing and imagination, something about the life of the mind, maybe particularly the life of an agile man inside a crippled body, something possibly hopeful, even if a little disorienting. But we also see clearly now a little bit more. We see Eigner's calligraphy. We see his crooked hand scrawling its way into and then out of a circle. We see that this is poem number 1117 and that it's from "Jan 3 [19]79," that the poem would be published in Orogrande , that Eigner thought, in three lines of type, that the "First 2 lines might be / a good title for a Col / lected Poems." By the time we arrive at the fourth frame, we see the entire page with the poem, and we see that the poem we have been looking at is in the middle of the page, and that it is only one of four poems on that sheet. Eigner's handwriting, which seems now relatively neat, heads every poem, providing the metadata we need to understand the poem: the poet's name, the date of composition, the sequential number, and the dotted lines that separate one poem deliberately from another. So I saw the covers and began reading this book of four books. It opens with the expected introductory matter, which shows Robert Grenier as someone attuned to both the look and the sound of Eigner's poetry and a person writing only for himself, a purified poet writing introductions in a sometimes schematic way, in bursts of prose, set off by dashes and commas and parentheses, which, in the end, at least for me, communicates his excitement with the work. And the work begins early in Eigner's career, with his juvenilia, starting when he was nine. The earliest poems show skill better than a nine-year-old should have but we have to read for years until Eigner slowly begins to turn into himself. It's a beautiful process, like an unfolding, to watch how rectangles of text open up, poem by poem, year by year, until their words are freed to roam the page and make their sense as they will. I'm only on page 57 right now, but I'll continue to write about this book, from time to time, all the way through to co-editor Curtis Faville's essay at the end of the book, all the way to the index by Amy Grenier. This is a large reading project, but an essential one for me. Early on, when I was barely a teenager, if that, Eigner was important to me, the poet I couldn't escape. Now, so many years in the future, I cannot even remember where or how I found Eigner, or what of his I read, but I was already a visual poet, so already interested as words as physical objects on a page, so Eigner was my poet, but he was also a poet, as these poems so clearly show. For many years, I didn't think of Eigner, and I don't know how this happened, how I let him slip away, how I found in my library of thousands of books not a single book of Eigner's, until a couple of years ago. But I'm returning home. We always do it, if only in our minds, because we cannot escape our origins. I'm not quite there, but in thirty pages I'll be to one of his famous poems, one that titled a book of his, "from the sustaining air," which is not that visual, but which has a beautiful sense of movement through the sense and sensing of the poem, and which ends with a line that really does seem to echo James Wright, but which reverberates with its own throaty call: "I am, finally, an incompetent, after all" And thus we understand our hapless flailings in this world, and something of the beauty of them, the beauty of merely trying. _____ Eigner, Larry.

I wrote quite a few thousand words tonight, but all via email and to friends, so I'm left with the idea of not writing a full posting tonight. I also spent part of the night putting a recent tiny publication of mine into small envelopes that I'd be sending out to 30 of my closest friends (many of whom I've never met). So I have decided to combine these two parts of my night into one, and announce the release of my leaflet "nfoldings" from pdqb (one of my many nanopresses). "nfoldings" is a small leaflet five pages in length, and it presents five of my visual poems, the first five poems of my "Waxwords" sequence. I find it a reasonably successful publication. Well enough designed and with a reasonably eclectic collection of five similarly created asemic poems. It is possible that my favorite of my own poems are those that are entirely wordless. ecr. l'inf.
