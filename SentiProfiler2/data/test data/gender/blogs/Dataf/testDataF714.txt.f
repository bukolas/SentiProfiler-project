Oy, what a weekend! We headed up to the general Seattle area on Friday for the Seattle Kennel Club dog show. Kim was super nice and let us stay at her house again. Once we got the dogs and ourselves settled in, we had a few glasses of wine and chatted for a bit. I had been forewarned that this show tends to be a bit of a zoo. There's a fair amount of promotion done for the show to encourage spectators (I have a strong suspicion it has to do with the fact that they charge admission for this show) and that creates a few issues for the exhibitors that I was about to witness first hand the next day. But first, I have to explain our lovely sleepless night.
