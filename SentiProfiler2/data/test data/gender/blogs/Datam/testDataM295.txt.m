Although Kazakh, he addresses us in Russian, confirming our worst fears. Despite attempts to infiltrate this country's Soviet-era bureaucratic system, we never registered our passports. Ironically, it's only now we're leaving that this archaic system acquires a statuesque importance, and it's a "big problem". Our entreaties in feeble Russian for leniency fall on deaf ears. "I speak to immigration police," comes the unyielding reply.

"Surely there's a way we can resolve this now?" Central Asian border posts are notoriously corrupt; here's an occasion when this could actually favour us. "Is there a fine we can pay?"

The angular features vacate their utilitarian casing. "Wait here!" We're left in the narrow passageway where foot traffic lurches between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, entrusted to a young, scrawny soldier who's eager to practise his English.

The three of us stand and wait, jostled amid the constant flow of leathery old women carting frail-looking wooden wheelbarrows of watermelons and jute. In the chaotic sea of cross-border traffic, we've become the flotsam of no-man's land.

As the minutes, then hours, pass, we appeal to our chaperone's humane side, sharing cigarettes before tossing them into the open gulley running alongside us. We tell him where we're from, where we're going, how much we've loved Kazakhstan.

"I think it's better for everyone if we resolve this problem here, no?" I offer tentatively.

Yellow teeth grin. "Yes."

"Perhaps your boss can help us?"

"Maybe. In Kazakhstan it's very difficult." He's eager, but noncommittal.

Eventually, the saturnine boss summons me into an office, warily looking over his shoulder. He calls in our protector, but insists my girlfriend stays outside. This is "man stuff".

Preliminary small-talk accompanies threats to deport us. I nod, indicating my appreciation of this grave situation, and try my luck again. "But surely we can resolve this here?"

Nervously glancing at the door, the boss shuffles his heavy frame in his inadequate chair. "We can register your passports now. But you must pay big fine."

Bingo. "How much?"

He indicates that I should accompany his acolyte to a more secretive room. Evidently, while it's OK for the chief to profit from a healthy bribe, it's not the done thing for him to participate in the negotiations. I follow my new friend into an even dustier office, littered with computer cadavers and paperwork from glasnost days.

"What currency?" I whisper conspiratorially once we're alone, but I'm not quiet enough: "Dollars!" bellows the boss – he's listening through the door.

My friend opens the bidding at $100, I offer $20. We soon agree on $50. Fortune is kind and I have the right note in my wallet – getting change would be inconceivable.

"Vam spa-seeba!" Stony features betray a Machiavellian grin as I deposit the bill into his top drawer. Minutes later, we're through.
