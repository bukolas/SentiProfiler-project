I've been working on some new material. " When you're blind aren't your other senses supposed to kick in? like Humor? Hey! I can't fully commit to a relationship- where's my parking spot? I don't know what I'm going off about- Bitter? just a bit. I've been driving through blizzards to perform for twenty years and I'm headlining at Bunker's sports bar Saturday. Yah- I see the obvious Hitler chunk- Bunker! He'll forever be connected to bunker's. Maybe if he'd hid in the Attic with the Franks he would have lived a little longer!
   What am I on about? I don't know. I just ate some porridge and am trying to drag myself to the gym. Good for me! It's Lent I'm not really Catholic I was raised Catholic but every-time one of my Alter boy buddies hung them selves I became a little less spiritual. I'm giving up junk food for lent. It doesn't seem right- Jesus gave up his life for us and I'm giving up Nibs and Junior Caramels. My Cross to bear.
   Well I'm watching the Olympics. We spend Millions on a cross country skier so they can finish 42. Alright- I'm not math guy but if GOLD is a hundred percent return on our investment where does 42 put our investment? Silver is 50% return Bronze 25- fourth 15 See where I'm going? You finish 42 that's the same as some schmuck calling up grandma and saying "hey I'm your long lost nephew! can you front me seven mill so I can travel the world for four years and party me ass off and then finish 42 in front of the family! If you're finishing 42 that's freakin idenity theft!
  Investing seven million so a cross country Biathlete can finish 42? listen that gun you have hanging around your neck- you can't hit a target twenty feet away! idea- spin the gun around and pull the trigger! Don't worry- you'll miss!
I'm OUT!
