Yea its all about the muscle guys have alot bigger muscle index than chicks and are naturally more bigger or taller than chicks. They take a higher calorie intake which means sometimes girls might eat the same as a guy but when you look at it the girl will eat more calories than they should and the guy will be at the calorie level he needs because guys have higher calorie intakes than girls. well thats how I see it ;) But yeah muscle helps burn calories faster making you lose weight and gain lean mass.
