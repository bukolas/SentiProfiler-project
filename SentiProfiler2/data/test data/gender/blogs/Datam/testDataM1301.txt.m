“Greetings from the President of the United States.” That's what it said when my draft notice came in the mail, a couple of wars ago. But instead of thinking about how hard it would be to leave my family and friends for months, or years, I had another thought that ping-ponged around inside my head. What to do with my beloved and pampered 1965 Mustang? It was just too dear to my heart to part with, and I didn't dare leave it for my parents to drive—or worse yet, my little brother. It would just have to be pickled, and put up on blocks for the duration. That was a long time ago, and I wish I had done a better job of preserving that car, so I could drive it today. Yes, I miss that Mustang. There are lots of men and women serving in our armed forces around the globe. And I receive plenty of mail from them asking me how they should store their cars while they are overseas. The rules of vehicular cold storage are the same no matter why the car is left behind. But storage isn't always kind to vehicles. Corrosion and decay take their toll on engines, bodies and interiors. Time itself can ruin tires, and even a car stored inside a garage can attract some unwanted furry house guests. Here's how to protect and store your car, truck or motorcycle—the right way. Store or Sell? Unless there's something very special about a particular car, I don't suggest placing a car in storage for more than a year. Special-interest and collector cars, like that 1966 Vette or antique Hispano-Suiza, might tug on your heartstrings (and purse strings) enough to keep them in the family, but anything that qualifies as practical daily transportation, no matter how nice it is, should be sold. You can replace it with another car when you're in need of a vehicle again. The loss in value of a car that accrues in another year from its manufacture, even if the odometer doesn't see any more miles, is too high. One option for shorter-term situations is to simply keep the car on the road. Find some responsible adult who will drive the car every two or three weeks for an hour or more. This will keep the drivetrain lubricated and the battery charged. An engine that doesn't run regularly collects moisture and internal rust, especially on the portions of the cylinder walls not covered by the pistons, valves, camshafts and valve springs. Ditto for the brake discs, which are made from easy-to-rust cast iron. A car that's driven far enough to get completely warm and remain that way for an hour or more will drive off the moisture, coat any lubricated surfaces with oil again, and sweep the rust off the discs before they start to pit. And keep your insurance active: In some states, dropping your car insurance, even if you're not going to be driving, will make it nearly impossible or very expensive to get insurance again when you're ready. Check with your insurance agent; he may be able to reduce your coverage or transfer it to some less expensive option. At the very least, you'll want theft and vandalism coverage—just in case.
