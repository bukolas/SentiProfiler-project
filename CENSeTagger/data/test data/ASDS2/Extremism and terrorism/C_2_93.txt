100% correct!!! Osama Bin Laden's Statement to the "Infidel" Nations (10-07-01) ]Source: Guardian Unlimited] The nations of infidels have all united against Muslims. You American people - can you ask yourselves why [there is] all this hate against America and Israel? The answer is clear and very simple, that America has committed so many crimes against the nations of Muslims. America is the head of criminals by creating Israel - this continuous crime for 50 years. The government which is besieging the people of Iraq and killing them. Why [is] your government...supporting the rotten governments of our countries? What happened in the United States is a natural reaction to the ignorant policy of the United States. If it continues with this policy, the sons of Islam will not stop their struggle. The American people have to know that what is happening to them now is the result of their support of this policy. The war against Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden is a war on Islam. This is a new battle, a great battle, similar to the great battles of Islam, like the conquest of Jerusalem. I believe that there is only one God and there is no prophet but Mohammed. America was hit by God in one of its softest spots. America is full of fear from its north to its south, from its west to its east. Thank God for that. This is something, very little, of what we have tasted for decades. Since nearly 80 years we have been tasting this humility. They [Americans] support the murder against the victims so God has given back to them what they deserve. I say that the matter is very clear. That every Muslim after this and after what the officials in America stated, with the head of the infidels, Bush, they come out with their men and equipment and they even encourage countries calling themselves Muslims against us. They come out to fight Islam in the name of fighting terrorism. These events have split the whole world into two camps: the camps of belief and the camps of disbelief. Every Muslim should support his religion and now the wind of change has blown up to the Arabian peninsula. I say by God the great, America will never dream, not those who live in America will never taste security and safety unless we feel security and safety in our lands and in Palestine.
