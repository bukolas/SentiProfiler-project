Our family of 4 really enjoyed our cruise on Disney Cruise Line's Wonder ship.  Even though we went off-season and it rained almost every day, it was a vacation we'll never forget.  The food was amazing and we felt like royalty every time we dined.  The shows were awesome, especially for our kids who had never seen a live theatre production before.  They also have very secure child care facilities that the kids just loved!  They thought we were dropping them off to have some parent-free fun, not the other way around!
