This is the prime ingredient of all moisturizers. Moisturizers are generally an oil-in-water solution. When you apply moisturizers, some of the water evaporates while some gets absorbed into the skin. The outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum soaks water efficiently; however, it is not able to bind it very well. That's why it needs an oily substance that helps lock in the water within the skin, and this is how moisturizers work. The water contents get absorbed within the skin and the oil content helps keep it there.
