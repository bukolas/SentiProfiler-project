I don't remember the last time I had visited a grave on the Mt. of Olives. Yes, I'd been to Ibrahim's home, but he lives in the neighborhood of the living.&nbsp; I guess I don't know that many holy people.&nbsp; The Mt. of Olives is the world's oldest and holiest Jewish cemetery dating from biblical times.&nbsp; Many holy rabbis over the centuries have been buried there.&nbsp; Even Madonna visited one of the Kabbalah rabbis, when she was here with the Kabbalah center.&nbsp; This past Friday, however, was the anniversary of my friend's son's death&nbsp;5 years ago.&nbsp; He had a rare genetic thing, which left him, since birth, severely handicapped.&nbsp; He never walked or spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he died at the age of 14,&nbsp;he was buried in the Mt. of Olives in a special plot for holy children - those who never spoke bad about anyone.&nbsp; It is a special merit to be buried there because space is limited and is usually reserved for renowned rabbis these days.&nbsp; Legend has it that when the resurrection happens, people buried there will be resurrected first. It was tough on my friend to visit his grave.&nbsp; She lost a son.&nbsp; It is always tough for the living.&nbsp; She knows he is fine, not trapped in a very handicapped body.&nbsp; When she dreams about him, he even&nbsp;speaks to her - something he never did when he was alive.&nbsp; I looked around at the gravestones.&nbsp; Some were so tiny - the babies must have been a few days, weeks or months when they died.&nbsp; Someone pointed out that right behind my friend's son's grave were the graves of the two Holzberg children - the children of the Chassidic couple that was killed&nbsp;during the Mumbai massacre a couple of years ago by Islamic&nbsp;extremists.&nbsp; They had died of illness&nbsp;before the tragedy with their parents&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp; Now they have no parents visiting their graves - only a 4 year old brother and grandparents.&nbsp; After we read the psalms and the quorum of 10 men left, the mother and a few of her friends stayed on to sit and keep this young soul of her son some company.&nbsp; We listened to the mother grieve for her son, for her loneliness and some shared what they felt too. grieving for a loved one &nbsp;I felt serene and there was an atmosphere of contentment sitting around the little souls. tiny grave &nbsp;There were red poppies&nbsp;growing wild by unmarked graves.&nbsp; I looked at the Holzberg graves and told my friend&nbsp;that her son and this&nbsp;boy were now friends and learning chassidut together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cellphones are expensive, but so necessary.&nbsp; I wonder how we managed years ago when we had to depend on pay phones to tell someone we'll be late, or make impulsive, last minute&nbsp;arrangements with friends and relatives.&nbsp; How inconvenient it all was, trying to find that quarter or whatever the cost was then.&nbsp; But my cellphone bill has been expensive of late and so I called up the competitor of my current cell provider.&nbsp; There are three major cellphone companies in Israel, Cellcom, Pelephone and Orange.&nbsp; I got a much better offer from the competitor, after complaining about my current cellphone provider&nbsp;so after a week or so, I got on the phone with my current provider and told them about the offer. Can they match it?&nbsp; Closely.&nbsp; They connected me with a special department called Customer Retention or something like that.&nbsp; I would get a new phone at 50% of the cost.&nbsp; I complained that their competitor offered me a free one.&nbsp; OK - then they'll give me a free one too.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; It sounded so easy! I went to their service store and waited nearly an hour to be seated with one of their reps.&nbsp; They wrote my number down on a piece of paper. I was number 218.&nbsp; Number 211 flashed on the screen but there was no customer.&nbsp; They probably got impatient and left.&nbsp; I could have been crafty and written the number 211 on the other side of the paper to be promptly seated - but I'm too American.&nbsp; Or Canadian.&nbsp; I'll wait my turn, the way civilized people are apt to do.&nbsp; I finally got my turn.&nbsp; The sales rep gets my phone number and asks me questions. "How much did they offer you?" I asked - "Isn't it on the computer?" "Yes, but you're a special case from the retention department.&nbsp; What exactly did they promise you?"&nbsp; I told him. "Yes, you're right" he says - obviously regaining his eyesight, as what they promised was probably on the computer screen all along.&nbsp; I couldn't figure out why they were playing this game. About 5 minutes into this, a woman comes over to me&nbsp;with a typed up survey in her hand - asking me how the service is and how is the sales rep I'm talking to? "Isn't it odd that you're asking me how is he when I'm&nbsp;right in front of him?| "Give me a 10" said the sales rep to me. "Ok, I'll give you a 10, but if I find that you're saying 'ok' to whatever was agreed on the phone and I get a totally different, more expensive,&nbsp;bill, I'm coming back to rate you a 1." "Don't worry.&nbsp; The new rate will show up on your bill." The new rate didn't show up on what I signed, and after I questioned him, he said it was standard.&nbsp; I'll get the new rate on my next bill because I was a "special" case. "So in case you're lying to me, how long am I contracted to you? "18 months" Fine.&nbsp;That's better than the&nbsp;more common&nbsp;3 year contract. &nbsp;If they're a bunch of liars, I'll use my phone minimally and pay the minimum charge and after 18 months switch to another provider.&nbsp; For years, ever since we made aliyah, I was considered by my kids to be so uncool.&nbsp; After all, I&nbsp;am an immigrant, speak Hebrew with an embarrassing accent, plus my grammar is often wrong.&nbsp; I&nbsp;like Western music, Arabs, Arabic music, health food,&nbsp;go to a trippy synagogue in Jerusalem, invite non-Jews for Shabbat dinner, eat in different restaurants all the time,&nbsp;see foreign films and often&nbsp;go alone.&nbsp; My oldest&nbsp;daughter even bought me a birthday gift&nbsp;-&nbsp;a 10-movie package - at&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem's landmark&nbsp; Smadar theater.&nbsp; I love the Smadar.&nbsp; They didn't destroy the Ottomon-era terracotta stone floors and opened up a restaurant attached to the theater.&nbsp; Unlike the cinemateque, you can bring in your beer and cappucino or hot cider - even wine - into the theater.&nbsp; There are others like me who sit alone in the theater.&nbsp; Lately, I saw the movies Push and A Serious Man there.&nbsp; Next week I'm seeing a Korean film with a friend (!).&nbsp; But now, all of a sudden, I'm cool.&nbsp; My complainer daughter hardly complains anymore.&nbsp; She hugs and kisses me daily.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; She has a new boyfriend.&nbsp; This guy comes from a Moroccan family BUT, and here's a big BUT, he enjoys Ashkenazi (European/Western) culture more than his own. He doesn't listen to Middle Eastern music and is astounded that my daughter acts more "Moroccan" than he.&nbsp; It's something he has to get used to, he says.&nbsp; His brother is actually a famous Israeli singer, who still churns out Israeli hits.&nbsp; This new boyfriend loves the Beatles, Doors, Stones and Fats Domino.&nbsp; My daughter doesn't know the songs to any of these.&nbsp; But now she's coming to me to learn this new Western culture her boyfriend is into.&nbsp; She's now proud of her once-uncool mother.&nbsp; I know I'm going to have to bring that photo of Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones and me together at an art gallery out of&nbsp; basement storage to impress him. "You're gonna love my mother" she coos to her boyfriend. "you might even want to marry her", she jokes, perhaps knowing a little of my Cougar fantasies. "See?&nbsp; This is how it starts.&nbsp; First you eat like that, and then you start inviting Arabs into the house." griped my son-in-law, as I gave my daughter, his wife, some healing foods for her ulcerative colitis.&nbsp; Brown rice with broccoli and carrots, drizzled with flax seed oil.&nbsp; I was amused by his theory, wondering if it were indeed true. He shook his head.&nbsp; He truly believes that granola eating hippies, like his mother-in-law, weren't always loving and tolerant&nbsp;human beings, but turned that way when they eschewed mostly junk food for a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; His wife was eating crap, like diet soda and fast food nearly every day, and the result is ulcerative colitis, which I'm trying to help her heal through food.&nbsp; And if that will&nbsp;heal&nbsp;her body as well as her soul&nbsp;, then why not?&nbsp; Because she'll turn into me?&nbsp; Is that what he's afraid of?&nbsp; I laughed at the prospect of her turning into a peace-nik and inviting all the Arabs who live in Jabel Mukaber into their tiny West Jerusalem home, and him, another middle-east Archie Bunker, tearing his hair out. My son's school has been calling me all month trying to get me to come to another one of their "emergency" meetings about my son who shows up in school, but hardly in class. "There are&nbsp;teachers who don't even know who he is!" exclaimed his&nbsp;principal. I tell the principal's secretary that I can't make it on the Sunday she wants me to come because my boss has a slew of meetings that day, and I have to prepare her on that day. "Isn't your son important to you?&nbsp; Don't you even care?&nbsp; Is your job so much more &nbsp;important than your own son?&nbsp; We made this meeting with a lot of people involved and that's when they could come!!"&nbsp; The principal's secretary is actually screaming at me.&nbsp; I look at the phone.&nbsp; I'm totally pissed.&nbsp; She continues, "they want to throw him out of school.&nbsp; Don't you think that's important?" I glare into the phone.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she can't see me gritting my teeth. "You never asked ME when "I" can make it.&nbsp; Keeping my job is showing my kids how responsible I am.&nbsp; If I don't have my job, then we'll be living in the streets.&nbsp;I'm not ready to sacrifice my job for a meeting in school.&nbsp; Sorry." I think she was shocked by my response.&nbsp; There was silence on the other end of the line. I&nbsp;continued.&nbsp; "If you want to throw him out of school, it will just have to wait another week." I shouted back at the secretary.&nbsp; I made the appointment for the week after, when my boss will be out of town. That afternoon I went into the local mall where one of the shops was selling pillows.&nbsp; My kids were all sleeping on pillows that had seen better days.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day, I was only buying for&nbsp;one of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;I ask her to show me a selection for my 20 year old daughter.&nbsp; The shopkeeper shows me a latex pillow that is the most expensive one in the store. "It's quite a lot of money." I complained to her.&nbsp; "I'd like to buy her a mid-range one.&nbsp; Not the cheapest and not the most expensive." She looked at me funny. "But it's your daughter!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't she worth the best?" I looked at the shopkeeper funny. "Absolutely not." And then I walked out of the store, seeing the shopkeeper's mouth still open.... here in the Holy Land, we are basking in the sun.&nbsp; I usually don't like to make you people living with cold weather jealous, but today I'll make an exception. We ate at Bariba overlooking the Yarkon River and Reading plant Mullet fish over risotto in saffron sauce The best mushroom gnocchi I've ever tasted covered with Parmesean foam (!) All sorts of people passed by That dog wants ice cream some people went boating some kids went swimming The Farmers Market was in full swing one of Hubby's favorite stores on Dizengoff Street with the latest fashion in undies (if you can call them that) Road signs wishing travellers a Shabbat Shalom I prepared so well, I thought, for the upcoming ticket sales in Israel for the Elton John concert in June.&nbsp; I read the reports&nbsp; of groups trying to get him to boycott Israel.&nbsp; Yawn.&nbsp; This is getting boring already.&nbsp; They do this to every celebrity who books concerts here.&nbsp; Most ignore the boycott pleas and threats.&nbsp; I hope Elton has the balls to pay no heed to these party poopers.&nbsp; Cancelling a concert will not make things better for Palestinians in this country.&nbsp; It'll just piss me off and probably a few other peacemakers too.&nbsp; But getting back to the tickets...Advance ticket sales were available to Bank Discount members beginning from 7:00 pm last night.&nbsp; I'm a member (or rather my husband is) - even though that bank pisses me off - except when they give their members perks such as this.&nbsp; &nbsp;I called up the bank last week to make sure that&nbsp;my credit&nbsp;card was open and ok to accept purchases.&nbsp; After all, it has been over a year since I used it.&nbsp; The bank clerk told me that there is no problem with the card.&nbsp; Yesterday I called another bank clerk to get more credit in case I want to buy more than 4 tickets.&nbsp; He said everything is fine.&nbsp; Wonderful.&nbsp; I'm ready. I did some errands then came back to the office at 6:45 pm and got the website ready on my computer.&nbsp; Of course by the time 7:00 pm rolled around, it took me 20 minutes to get onto the site.&nbsp; I finally got in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yay!&nbsp; I filled out all the information they needed, picked out some fabulous seats in the front row on the side of the stage - very close to the stage, in fact - &nbsp;and then took my credit card out.&nbsp; I plugged in the numbers, my ID number, etc. and then I saw the expiry date.&nbsp; I look at the card - remember, I had been planning this for a week already - and the expiry date says 09/09.&nbsp; SHIT!&nbsp; I tried putting in a random expiry date, but the computer is smart.&nbsp; It doesn't take my card.&nbsp; I use the other Visa I have, but the computer insists I use the Bank Discount credit card.&nbsp; I leave the webpage open, just in case I never get in again because of all the people trying to buy tickets at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to think fast.&nbsp; I call up the credit card company.&nbsp; I'm frantic.&nbsp; I'm wondering if there are more frantic people calling them about Elton John. "Look, I'm trying to buy Elton John tickets, and my visa date expired.&nbsp; Can you give me a new updated date?&nbsp; Please?" It&nbsp;seems hopeful at first while the clerk puts me on hold probably to speak to his manager.&nbsp; He comes back on. "Sorry. You have to speak to your bank about this.&nbsp; We don't give new expiry dates." "But my bank doesn't open until 8:30 in the morning" I wailed. "Can't you give me a temporary one?" "No.&nbsp; I'm so sorry."&nbsp; He really sounded sympathetic.&nbsp; But there was no point in arguing with him.&nbsp; I had to think quickly while the ticket sales website was still on the payment page.&nbsp; AH!&nbsp;&nbsp;I remembered that a good&nbsp;friend of mine has a Discount Visa.&nbsp; We tried doing this together, but she had a difficult time with the Hebrew instructions.&nbsp; I guided her through but the transaction failed.&nbsp; She doesn't have enough credit on her card. Never give up.&nbsp; My Complainer daughter has to do something good for her mother, doesn't she, instead of chronically complaining all the time.&nbsp; I call her several times.&nbsp; She doesn't answer her phone.&nbsp; It's 8:00 pm, and no tickets.&nbsp; I go out for dinner with friends.&nbsp; My daughter calls and apologizes (!). She was working and couldn't answer her phone, but if I'm in town, we can go home together. Yes, and I could take your Visa, I thought.&nbsp; She didn't complain when I asked her for it.&nbsp; Not a flinch.&nbsp; When I arrived home after midnight I went into my son's room where the computer is.&nbsp; I let him rant and rave about me making noise.&nbsp; I tried to bribe him with concert tickets but he's not interested.&nbsp; I finally get into the site.&nbsp; Most of the great seats are gone - except for the very expensive lawn seats.&nbsp; I get a gate close to the stage, but 23 rows up.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; Not as great as I could have gotten had I had an updated credit card, but they were good nevertheless. So Elton, hang on....it'll be a rocky road with every asshole trying to get
you to cancel the concert.&nbsp; Don't listen to anyone.&nbsp; Just do what you have to do so we can all have a great time together.... Be careful who you start conversations with standing at bus stops.&nbsp; It's not like people are dangerous here.&nbsp; They aren't.&nbsp; And it's easy to jump into a&nbsp;stranger's conversation.&nbsp; The stranger who is talking usually looks around and talks to whoever is standing around.&nbsp; Some are receptive and sometimes one can engage in fun conversation about all sorts of things while waiting for the bus. So yesterday I jumped into a bus stop conversation about People.&nbsp; Persian people and then Russian people. "Not all of them are bad" said a woman to a man. "You always get one bad apple in the tree" the man answered. I interjected in Hebrew, "Well, what do you think about Canadians?" Bad move on my part.&nbsp; The man continued his tirade all throughout the 40 minute bus ride with me about his Canadian neighbor whose dog barked outside every&nbsp;day at 4:00 am.&nbsp; "I told her I was going to kill the dog."&nbsp; He leered at me.&nbsp; He clearly isn't too fond of Canadians.&nbsp; Then he went on about putting talcum powder on the floor and I couldn't understand half of what he was saying.&nbsp; I really just wanted to relax on the bus ride home and not talk to anyone.&nbsp; I got home and tried to make dinner.&nbsp; The two men in the family began bickering. "Who ate my cookies?" demanded Hubby.&nbsp; Someone at work made chocolate chip cookies for me&nbsp;for my birthday&nbsp; I brought them home and told Hubby that they were for him for HIS birthday this week.&nbsp; He was so happy.&nbsp; Before the cookies were eaten, that is.&nbsp; My son admitted to the crime.&nbsp; "There were only 10 left!" "10!!!&nbsp; YOU ATE ALL 10???? YOU PIG!!!" and a war of the words started, with name calling back and forth, which ended up with my son throwing Hubby's files out of our son's room, where they are kept, and then Hubby taking the computer monitor out of our son's room and putting it into our locked storage room. And then I thought it is much easier dealing with strangers on the bus, who can talk the ass out of a turkey, than this. It was bad enough when the water stopped running right before the Sabbath.&nbsp; I was about to put on the slow cooker a dish called Hamin, which takes overnight to cook, and consists of everything basically - meat, chicken, beans, potatoes, stuffing, barley, and seasoned either sweet or salty or middle eastern.&nbsp; The water shut off just as I was about to wash a bunch of scallions.&nbsp; I was horrified.&nbsp; I ended up washing the scallions in a pot full of water that had cooked the artichokes.&nbsp; I felt good.&nbsp; I was recycling.&nbsp; The neighbors kept on going onto the roof to see if they could fix the water thing (whatever it's called),&nbsp;while the rain was pouring down at the same time.&nbsp; For a few minutes they were successful and then --- no water from the taps.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; We thought of a weekend with toilets full of shit and family members in sore need of a shower. "I have my PERIOD!!" shouted one of my daughters during the meal. "What's a period?" asked my bright 18 year old son.&nbsp; He had no idea what that word meant in English. "YOU tell him" I ordered my son-in-law. But before our meal, while this water shortage thing was going on, I had smelled smoke coming from the air vents.&nbsp; I panicked because Hubby was over at my married daughter's house in Jerusalem and called the fire department.&nbsp; Two men came into the house, looking like professional ...ghostbusters or whatever.&nbsp; Oxygen tanks on their backs, contraptions which measure or find the source of the smoke.&nbsp; The odor was quite strong.&nbsp; They were with me in the apartment for a good 20 minutes.&nbsp; Then I lift up one of my pots that was on the stove and see a little rattan coaster sticking to the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; It was burnt to a crisp.&nbsp; I found the culprit and I felt so stupid.&nbsp; The firemen looked at me and smiled.&nbsp; They must go through this often, I thought&nbsp;(perhaps others would be as mindless as myself). Meanwhile, Hubby returned as the men were leaving.&nbsp; He didn't care if the house was burning - he was just thrilled to be able to eat&nbsp;on paper plates, as his dishwashing duties was temporarily suspended.
