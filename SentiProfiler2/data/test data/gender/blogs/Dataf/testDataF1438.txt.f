Jaden and I usually have our date night on Fridays, so we just had one a few hours ago. As usually, it was a hit. Jaden got to pick the date night agenda and he picked books and two Pokemon movies. He asked if we could read three books together and he wanted me to watch two Pokemon movies with him. Well, he fell asleep halfway through the first movie. I ended up taking all 65lbs of him upstairs to his bed, but it was still such a success! He had the biggest smile on his face as he was giving me the 411 on Charizard and Pikachu.
