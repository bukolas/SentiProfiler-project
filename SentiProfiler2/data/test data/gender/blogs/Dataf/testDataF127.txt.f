happy monday!  well off to the new week and of course that means  new stuff from  BBTB2 YAY YAY! heather's doing such  a great job with BBTB  dont ya think :)  be sure to stop by and play along with us  its not only fun for the DT to see what each other comes up with for the week but also to see what you can do for us :)
were very fortunate to have Technique Tuesday as  our sponsor. we were sent the cutest lil stamp set to use .. along with that heather chose for us to use flourish3 from stretch your imagination cartridge.
so for my card...which i had so much fun working on...the deer, butterflies, mushrooms, flowers and sentiment are all from the stamp set called oh deer. ( theres a few other things included with this set too)  i adore this set!! clear stamps and they stamp so perfectly.
so where the heck is the flourish we were supposed to use..well, its what the flowers are growing on :) i cut 2 and just glued them down then stamped and cut out those sweet little flowers . pretty eh :) 
i made a cute lil button sun by punching a 1 3/4 inch circle then i traced around the button, snipped around glued the button on and wah lah!  sweet . my fabulous paper is by memorybox. i added a tad of stickles memorybox pearls and colored  all the stamped images with colorbox fluid chalk.i also cut some paper and made a grassy hill . hope you like this one :) thank you big time for stopping by for a visit i love company :)
hoping your week starts off good :) XXXshelly
