Patrick is a Canadian born designer who at 19 produced his first pair of shoes for Loucas Kleanthous, a Toronto based designer.  Loucas encouraged Patrick to go to design school.  Not one to let his studies get in the way of his education, Patrick, through his partying,  made friends with Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano who were rising fashion stars at the time. Vivienne had him design the shoes for her Clint Eastwood collection in 1984 and designed the shoes for Galliano’s Fallen Angels collection in 1986 and continued to work with Galliano for six years.  I tried to find photos of those two collections but failed.    He designed the prototype for Vivienne Westwood’s shoes that tripped up Naomi Campbell on the Paris Catwalk  in 1993. 

Here are more Patrick Cox shoes for you, via PatrickCox.com. In 2008 he sold most of  his company to “Fast” Eddie Davenport because the recession hit the business hard, then in 2009 there was talk about litigation.  I hope Mr. Cox is able to salvage his company. So I have been idly watching Carey Mulligan, the  twenty five year old British actress, because she seems to have a great sense of style. (Her stylist is Tiina Laakkonen who has a good artistic eye.)  She seems to like Prada and Lanvin, but has been seen wearing other designers too.   I went back a few months to show you what she has been wearing.  She is a tiny, tiny girl, so she has to watch that her clothes don’t overpower her.  I think she has done that. October 2009 wearing a gladiator-ish studded dress from the  Prada Fall 2009  with Prada sandals.  I love the red lips.  August 2010. At the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala wearing Prada from the Spring 2010 line,  shoes fron the same collection.  These shoes have that clear Lucite heel. This is probably the most amazing skirt around.

This is probably the most amazing skirt around.  February 2010 at the BAFTAs  in Vionnet dress, YSL shoes.  This is the second Vionnet dress Carey has worn.  She wore a gorgeous red dress  and nude Vionnet pumps on October 2009 for the premier of An Education in London.  Galligator told us abut this design house a few months ago.  Apparently Anna Wintour has taken a liking to Carey.  The story Carey tells is that,  ”Anna said I should wear short for the Oscars. I was like, ‘No that is so not what I had in my head when I was six years old!’ For the Oscars, she went long, even with a train. (I guess not everyone does what Ms. Wintour says.)  She wore a Prada dress with Prada sandals.   The dress got mixed reviews.  I think she looked great.  This is what she wears on her day off.  This photo was taken the day after the Oscars.  Trapeze smock, brown jersey pants and black ballet shoes.  Just the right outfit for Los Angeles.

 It will be fun to what she and Tiina decide for the Costume Institute Gala and Cannes.  It will undoubtably be beautiful.
