This game was a blast. You (as Drake) start the game waking up in a train that is dangling over the side of a cliff. You have to climb up the train car, which is slowly teetering off the edge of the cliff, ready to plummet miles down into a snowy abyss. From the snowy beginning there are flashbacks to what led Drake to this predicament. The story unfolds in a very cinematic manner, and the scenes in between levels, while a bit clich√©d by Hollywood standards, are still just as good if not better than your average brainless Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis action movie. In fact, the cheese is part of the fun and I would venture to say it's intentional.
