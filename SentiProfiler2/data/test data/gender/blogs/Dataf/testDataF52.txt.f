The most irritating yet adorable characteristic of Billiken is the way he keeps us up all night with his antics. This incident happened a few weeks back . To complete my usual day , i went to bed and dozed off. I suddenly felt the presence of a living object near me . I felt it . No it wasnt a pillow. I opened my eyes and guess who! Mr. Naughty (Billiken) . I was damn sleepy , i just ignored him and kicked him out of my bed. The next morning i wasnt even sure if Billiken's coming to my room was real or just my crazy dream. I mentioned this to my mom and she was positive that it was my dream , cause "billiken will never walk into our rooms at night". He repeated himself the following night too , but this time i was wide awake. I shoved him away a couple of times , to be exact 6! But he was relentless. Oh! Dash it ! it was already one thirty at night! But he wasnt planning to give up. Later that night , when my dad walked in to check on us , he found Billiken sleeping between my sister and me. Things like this are pardonable once in a while , but not everyday.
