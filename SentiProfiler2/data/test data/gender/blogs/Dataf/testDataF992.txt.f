But this is no philosophy essay. After second year's 20th Century French Thought, I vowed never to delve into the subject in great depth ever again. However, I can say from experience that languages encapsulate humanity. The death of a language marks the death of an entire way of thinking, of self-justification, self-understanding and identity. Hector Kollias of King's French Department could do a much better job of explaining it than I ever could. You want more, email him.

I have to spend my day speaking and understanding German and it is then that the true strength of a language to shape its speakers really comes into play. In English, you can beat about the bush. "Erm... excuse me, sorry, I was wondering... you wouldn't mind awfully if I happened to take this seat, would you?". It's a language of apology, indirectness and implications. German? No such luck. These structures simply don't work. If you want the chair, you bloody well ask if you can take the chair. No bones about it. You say what you mean and nothing else. Yes, of course they have their idiomatic phrases - have you had a nose full of someone recently? If you have an exam, do you press your thumbs for luck?
