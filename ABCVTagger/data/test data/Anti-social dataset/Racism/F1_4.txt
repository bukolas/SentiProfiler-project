People ask me if I'm racist and yeah I am racist, because I care about my race which is the white Aryan race. Only idiots don't care about it. In my point of view Aryans are all the same but all together are the best in the world, I'm not getting into the details of why we consider ourselves to be the best, maybe a couple of history classes can enlighten those viewers who are curious about it. The expectations of a true Aryan person isn't much.. A future of Aryans in which there is no class or ranks nor is there any distinction, a future in which there are no opposing sides blocking our ways to success, we want to see one nation in the world, we want our people to be obedient and we must practice for this obedience and the most crucial of all is that we are peace loving people and at the same time we are courageous.. The nation we will build is not going to be soft.. No matter what we create today or what we do today, we will pass away, but in ourselves Nazism will live, and when nothing remains of us then we must hold in our fists the flag we tore from nothing. We know that around us is Nazism, in us marches Nazism and behind us Nazism follows so we know there is nothing to be scared of. My Nazi brothers and sisters, we all will be a part of the history of a GREAT Nazi movement in the 21st century.
