Any excuse to go to visit the geniuses at the Apple store on 14th Street. The building is so stunning it's worth hanging about there getting giddy from all the glass stairs and so forth. And then to have someone do utterly clever things with the computer and unearth things I thought were irretreiviably lost.I think the place has had 196,000 plus photos taken of it already, but it's fun anyway.
