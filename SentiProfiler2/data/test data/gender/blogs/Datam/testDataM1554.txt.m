I've always been a gadget fiend, having bought dozens of digital cameras, mp3 players, handheld GPS devices, and cell phones .. now all in one.
My favorite things

    * design - so clean, plus love the touch screen
    * google maps - more than a map, also shows you bus/train options and travel time
    * google voice search - much easier to say a few words than to type them
    * safari - full on web browser, fast when on wifi
    * mp3 player - love my 32gb and sync with iTunes playlists
    * all the apps - games, productivity
    * and Specific to 3GS - way faster than 2G, and compass makes some apps better, like google maps
