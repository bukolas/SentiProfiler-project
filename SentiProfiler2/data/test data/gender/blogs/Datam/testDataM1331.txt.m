he best way to protect yourself from computer viruses and remote attackers is to dedicate a computer to doing it for you, kinda like a network gateway for your home network. If you're the type of person that always worries about viruses and sensitive information being stolen but don't know that much about computer networks, I'd recommend using untangle (http://www.untangle.com/home-content-fil. ), very easy to install and can quickly protect you home network in minutes, there's also parental filtering with predefined filters if you're worried about what sites your kids go on. In the package you get a Firewall, Virus Protection, Spyware Blocking, Phish Blocking, Spam Blocking, Protocol Control (Blocks protocols for online games, IM & P2P), Reports and Monitoring, all of this has automatic updating as well, plus its free :D.
