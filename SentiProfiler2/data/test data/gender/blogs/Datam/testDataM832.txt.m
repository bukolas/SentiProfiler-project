There is no place to hide from God- not in the heights of heaven nor in the depths of hell. God finds us. In the light or in the dark; In the open air or in the womb; God knows us, loves us, and helps us- guiding us, holding us fast. When doctors do not know enough, God knows- for He made us. Not one cell, one molecule- not one atom or subatomic particle-- that makes us who we are is hidden from Him.
