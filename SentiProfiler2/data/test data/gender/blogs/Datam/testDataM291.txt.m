Seeing as there is a dry, sunny day unfurling right outside my window, Spring can't be far away, and with it the long rumored Netflix Instant Streaming functionality creeps ever closer to Wii owners, and yes, by owners I mean me.

Truth be told, this functionality is far more than a rumor. It was in fact confirmed on the Netflix Blog back in January. Also, of course Netflix streaming is nothing new, having been available for a good long while via computer and a pretty wide array of devices, including Wii competitors Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The question has got to be though, why did this take so long? After all, with literally millions of Wiis having been sold across a very mainstream demographic in less than four years, Nintendo's device would seem the perfect hardware target. It might be that Netflix was bound by exclusivity agreements in these earlier deals, or perhaps it is that Nintendo didn't see video functionality as worth its time, considering the Wii's modest processing power, the overall limited number of titles available via the service and/or that they would not have total control. Along with possibly a little arrogance on Nintendo's part, all of these are fairly valid possibilities. What is certain though is that a large number of Netflix subscribers use the streaming service, not to replace the mail-based primary Netflix service, but as a supplement to it. Myself, I have an Xbox 360 in one room and a PS3 in another, both set up for streaming. Like the PS3, Wii owners will need a free Netflix-supplied disc that must be inserted into the drive in order to stream content. (A Netflix unlimited account of any level and a broadband connection are also required) The disc-in method is much more clumsy than those utilized by the other devices, which either were manufactured with Netflix streaming in mind or were patched with a software updates. Using the PS3 as an example, it is doubtless true that the disc method both adds a little noise to the viewing experience and uses more energy. The Wii is very energy efficient and pretty quiet though, so there should be few issues. In addition, perhaps Nintendo will get a clue and add a Netflix channel to its Wii functionality, which could eliminate the need for a disc down the road. Until then a disc will do fine.
