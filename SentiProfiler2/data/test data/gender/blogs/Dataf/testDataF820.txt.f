I think that I mentioned a while ago that I've decided to pick up knitting.  I've been meaning to for a while now, and I recently found my starter kit so I got going.  It does seem to be the thing to do these days.  And there are a few women on campus who get together once a week to knit over lunch, so it is a nice thing to do to relax a bit at work (not that I really have the time).  Anyhoo, I am happy to announce that I have two projects under my belt now!
