Born in Brooklyn and now living in the not so wide open spaces of NJ. I have a 35 year old son - yes I was a knocked up teen - he and his wife share a Mother/Daughter type home with me. I run my own business - used to have an office but now work out of home. I often work a second job to pay for Internet service. I have 2 rescued cats.
