Assalaamu alaykum, Bro Ayubi, I believe his name was Abu Hudeifah, and he had a pro-al-Qaida leaning. Right? The reason why HAMAS attacks Jund Ansar Allah is this: they (HAMAS) are sell-outs. They do not care about Islam, Gaza, or the Palestinian people; all they care about is themselves and money. They leadership I should say. They do not implement shariah because they know if they do they will be attacked. They have a "love for this world and a hatred for death" and they would rather live with money and power than fight to make Shariah supreme simply because they are cowards. Real Mujahideen say "If we are killed, then our reward is in Jannah, and if we live and establish Shariah, then our reward in here on earth and in Jannat" and the rewards of the shaheed are best than all of earth and everything in it.
