Most people have heard about the holiday blues, but not many have heard of the holiday flares. For those of us with rheumatoid arthritis this time of year can be the beginning of very painful season. There are many contributing factors to why you may experience a flare during the holidays; bad eating, stress and depression, just to name a few. Your RA symptoms may increase due to these factors and can make what should be a great holiday into a flare to remember. The fact is we can not always control our symptoms, but we can make choices to help avoid the pitfalls of pain. The most important tip that I can give you is to slow down. There are a million things to do and not enough time to do them. So, keep it simple. Your house doesn't have to look like a Christmas museum in order to feel festive!
