Sahuayo was affected by the Cristero War of 1926 - 1929. The Cristero War was the most significant relapse to violence and conflict after 1917. It arose from the clergy and traditionalist groups protesting the anti-Catholic policies of the Constitution. The Constitution sought to secularise the country and limit the power of the church. The Constitution prohibited the chucrh from aquiring land, banned monastic orders and church-run schools and forbad any religious activity outside View of the Santuary of Guadalupe of churches (now the property of the government).
