It is spurious to argue that smaller companies now have the benefit, and should not be denied the benefit in the future, of the services of chartered and certified accountants whose qualifications are better than those of members of the society. After all, smaller companies never see the principals. They see only the articled clerks. Many of the big firms of chartered accountants have so many principals that the currency in that respect may have been debased.
