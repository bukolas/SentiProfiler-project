I haven't been keeping up with the blog very well. I've been spending much less time on the computer than I used to but thought I could update real quick. Adrian's IEP meeting is this coming Friday. I'm always nervous for these and generally have a very “emotional” week during his IEP meeting weeks. We'll see, last year it went very smoothly. School is going great, his teacher is amazing. I really wasn't sure at the beginning of the year but he's made more progress these last few months than he has ever made. He's chugging right along, he can read some simple sentences, he can say anything that we ask him to say but spontaneous conversation isn't there yet, he can write his name. His stimming is still wildly out of control and he can't sit still. His teacher had me fill out a paper for the Conner's scale to see about possible ADHD. We've always thought he may have ADHD as well and we have talked to a developmental pediatrician about that and he had told us they don't like to diagnose ADHD until at least first grade. It seems like the teacher is really hoping we can talk to his doctor about this possibility and see if there is anything we need to do to help him in this area. We're going to talk about this more at the IEP and we'll probably be scheduling a visit to the doctor and possibly the Iowa State University hospital to look into this more if we need to. The girls are good. I took Nevaeh to the art center the other day and she loved it. Her favorite thing by far was painting. She also made a necklace and played in shaving cream. There was a lady sitting in there playing a keyboard for the kids and she was holding a cute fuzzball of a dog. Nevaeh loved that. Usually Nevaeh is scared of dogs but this one was so tiny and quiet so Nevaeh was actually petting it which surprised me. Sanura got her report card. She's doing very very well. Her teacher made a note that Sanura was doing better socially but needed to “use her time wisely” Sanura wasn't sure what she meant by that so we talked it over and hopefully she understands that she needs to be staying on task. The only part I saw that was concerning was Sanura's subtraction facts…I guess she's having trouble with that so we'll be practicing that at home. Sanura always gets very good marks in music. She loves to sing and she's good at it too. I'm trying to come up with a way to help her expand on that and practice that more since it's something she seems to enjoy so much and something that she's good at. Mister Lincoln got another hair cut today. He was so good, barely moved throughout the whole thing. He's talking more and more. He's even saying a few sentences now, the other day he actually told me “Open the door!” I was kind of surprised by that one!
