For more than a year , I have been listening to her polambals during tea breaks .I must agree that it has been pretty entertaining . I have been subjected to similar tortures , that includes having to eat what she cooked ....and still , when I want to share something important , she is one of the first person who comes to my mind .
Bhu ..u rock :).
