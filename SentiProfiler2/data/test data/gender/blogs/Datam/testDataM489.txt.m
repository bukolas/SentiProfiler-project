Any universal health care system will have to be two fold. Public and private. Privately insured and government funded. The government funded would have to have some form of bulk billing by doctors and hospitals to keep the overall cost down. Services would have to be combined as well wherever possible to prevent double billing. ie... seeing a GP for a problem then being referred to a specialist, then having to return to the GP for further direction. And of course, no universal health care would be effective unless it included dental coverage as many health problems are related to poor oral care. The major drug manufacturing companies have to be on board as well if this were to succeed.
