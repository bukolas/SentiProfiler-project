I used Sharp Auto body to repair my car after an accident, and I cannot say enough good things about this business.  Lou Sharp, the owner, was extremely courteous, friendly, and professional, and they did an excellent job on my car.  It looks brand new.  They even have a paint match guarantee, for the life of your car.  The entire staff was friendly, and a perk is the free loaner cars.  I highly recommend them.
