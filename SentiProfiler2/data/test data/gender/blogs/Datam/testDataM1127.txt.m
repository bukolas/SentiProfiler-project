To Nine.
Thursday, 11 March 2010
It is three minutes to nine. Soon the pendulum will strike true west, and mark another hour washed into the abyss of lost time condemned to eternal waste. Still I sit here active in inaction; pondering over my seventeen inch prison bars taunting me with meaningless pixilation of lights.

Three minutes past nine. Six wasted minutes over three pointless sentences. Inspiration still hid behind the inexorable walls of Hadrian. The light of words-smiting lost behind barbarity of procrastination.

Six minutes past nine. I wonder about the curious day past. Predicate, Delegate; I am drowning in my own world of algorithmic hypnotism.

Tab, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, F5, Tab, Tab, Tab, Crash; eighteen minutes past nine and I am writing absolute nonsense.

sanubari dimimpi tanpa haluan,
udah mengenang derita di hati,
riwayat rintis kehilang tujuan,
merintik irama yang sudah mati.

beautiful beyond words and expression, but all I see is thorns.

"why do pride forever stop us taking words back,
why do we still chain ourselves to begone past?"
