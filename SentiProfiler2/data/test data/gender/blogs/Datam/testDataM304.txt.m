Is it time to throw Leo to the lions? The Beach, in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a backpacker in Thailand who thinks he has found a map to paradise, is going to piss off a lot of people just because he's in it. After his unprecedented Titanic splash two years ago, DiCaprio took a vacation from acting, presumably to party, but in the media he was a constant source of backlash-building fascination: all Leo, all the time. The Beach returns DiCaprio, 25, to the screen, not as the talented kid who held his own against Robert De Niro in 1993's This Boy's Life but as a Hollywood player with Titanic-size box-office clout.

DiCaprio received $20 million to play Richard in the film version of Alex Garland's 1996 cult novel about Gen X disillusionment. Wasn't Richard a Brit in the book? No problem - for Leo, you make him American. Wasn't it the plan of director Danny Boyle, producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter John Hodge - the British team behind the indie hits Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- to make a low-budget film? No problem -- for Leo, you spend $50 million. Wasn't actor Ewan McGregor -- the team player behind Shallow Grave and Trainspotting -- the first choice to play Richard? No problem -- for Leo, you make adjustments.


And so The Beach comes to the screen freighted with enough Leo baggage to make the movie seem beside the point. It isn't. The Beach, for all its lapses of judgment and failures of nerve, has its strong points. DiCaprio is one of them. His Richard is a pop-culture junkie, constantly pushing the video games he plays to the next level of difficulty and living his life the same way. Traveling alone in Thailand, he checks into a Bangkok flophouse, where the night sounds include a sexy French couple -- Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) -- and a suicidal Scot named Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rambles about a map to a perfect beach on a hidden island. The next day, Richard finds Daffy's bloody corpse and the map. Note: Daffy returns with a vengeance in dream sequences, one of which shows him and Richard gunning down tourists. Yikes.
