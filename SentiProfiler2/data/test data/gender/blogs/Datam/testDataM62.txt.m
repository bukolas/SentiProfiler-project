Your lips dont move,yet you talk through your mind telepathically.You could even feel your heart beating with a sense of love. The atmosphere now is,calm and tranquil,and ur minds or rather your hearts could communicate effectively,which gives you a feeling that there is no one in this world to seperate you,and a gentle look at the moon is to just show that your love is eternal and perpetual like the moon.The feeling of complacency can also be sensed which indicates that you had thoroughly enjoyed every moment being spent and no longer need anything more in your life...It looks as if the entire sky is there to protect you,and to keep you closer and even more intimate. A drop of tear would make it even more emotional and passionate,indicating the intensity of your love. A candle light dinner is meant to evoke the lost emotions in your hearts,the fire that has lost in the labyrinth of daily routines and hectic work schedules.
