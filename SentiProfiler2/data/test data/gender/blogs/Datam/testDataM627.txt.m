I am one of the ardent fan of news channels and i always felt that its one of the  revolution of this century. But after seeing the happenings in the media coverage of "MUMBAI MASSACRE",I felt that these news channels are no way better than the politicians and they showed their ugly face many times..I would just quote few incidents here INCIDENT ONE: Lets go back to 26th of november,the day the terrorists started their attacks at the heart of Mumbai.If u had watched the news channels keenly, a man was deeply hurt in his hand and blood was flowing due to a terrorist attack in Oberoi Hotel. At the same time, all news channels were covering this incident..Wat they should have done??...they should have  taken him to the hospital,atleast they should have given some sort of First-Aid...But do u know wat they did.. A Reporter says "HELLO PLEASE COME HERE..PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR HANDS..PLEASE DONT RUN...HOW DID THEY SHOOT YOU??...DID COMMANDOS COME FOR YOUR HELP??.....But that man is under immense pain due to loss of blood,  but around 20 reporters  ask him questions,for whom a "BREAKING NEWS" is more important than a man's hand......Heartless people.....
