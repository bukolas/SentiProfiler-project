Be my Valentine Lacey Heart I think this is really pretty. I found it here and there is a free chart! I was browsing the web and came across this site with some nice cross stitch patterns to download for free. You can find the list of free charts here: http://shopping.originpublishing.com/charts_category.asp?category=5 This is just one of the cute ones you could do up as a nice Christmas card. And here is the link: http://shopping.originpublishing.com/chart.asp?id=974&amp;category=5 I came across some quick little Easter free pattern kits at Hobby Loco. Here is a preview of the pretty egg plus there are two bunnies and a chick there. Go Here to see these and download. This pair of hearts that would be a quick addition for Valentines Day! Find the free download pattern HERE at free-cross-stitch-pattern.com This cute 50's type silhouette image really caught my eye. It uses 14 count aida cloth and three colors of DMC thread. If I were stitching it I would probably not do the white stitches that are outside the design. Since it is done on white cloth, I would be lazy and skip this step. :-) Either way, 2 or 3 colors, it would be so easy to stitch up for Valentines Day ! You can find this design and pdf download HERE at Free Cross Stitch Pattern. Com. It will be in the romance category and it is called romantic dinner. I just checked Tereena Clarke's Artecy Cross Stitch and she has a beautiful free download up for grabs. I am partial to birds so naturally I really like this one, but I think you will too! It makes me want to get back to stitching! See it HERE. She also has a cute Santa so you have a whole year to do that one. Have fun. Sometimes it is difficult to take a good snapshot of something in a photo frame.&nbsp; I snapped this view of a project that I completed way back when I was learning to cross stitch.&nbsp; It is not the first, because as I said earlier on the blog that the barns were my first stitched projects.&nbsp; This may be my second one, I don't remember for sure but it is somewhere in there as one of my first. I found this chart while browsing through the magazine Classic Stitches web site. There are several pretty free charts there to download. They will be within the stitching zone drop down button across the top of the page. I found this one listed in the flowers-fruit category and thought it was pretty enough to share. The design is worked throughout in cross stitch and back stitch.
