After I graduated in Bachelor of Business Administration, I went back Hong Kong and did three months part-time job as a logistic assistant. I did not satisfy with a position of assistant. I would like to make decision judgements and be hold accountability of my action. Here is what they say in America: undergrad only study about theory; a master program study about implementation. Then, I quickly used my connection connect with my old school; they granted me an assistantship soon I've contacted with them.
