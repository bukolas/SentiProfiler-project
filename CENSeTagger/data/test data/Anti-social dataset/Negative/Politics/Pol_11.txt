Is the Home Secretary aware that I support the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser), who represents parts of Brixton? Is he also aware that in all parts of Brixton, including the areas that I represent, his statement will cause deep disappointment and anger? Does he not accept that it is difficult for us to question him when we have not had an opportunity to see the report as it is not yet in the Library?
Is not the Home Secretary deceiving himself&#x2014;I hope that he would not want to mislead the House in any way&#x2014;if he has the impression that the only way in which aggrieved people are taking action is through the official complaints procedure? ls he aware that one of my constituents was sitting in a car in Railton Road that morning, the windows were smashed and she was asked by the police to get out of the car? Her legal advisers said that there was no point in her going through the police complaints procedure. They advised her to take civil action. I hope that no one will suggest that she smashed the windscreen with her bare hands.
