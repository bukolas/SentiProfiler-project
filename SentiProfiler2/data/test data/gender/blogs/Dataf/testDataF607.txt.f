I've finally begun a new blog, in keeping with the fact that I'm not in Poland anymore. So please visit The Wendy Lady at your earliest convenience. Polish customer service (or the lack thereof) The homeless guy who asked if he could take our unused ramekins full of garlic & tomato sauce at a restaurant last night Buses & trams that never show up, or randomly take an alternate route The view from my apartment The homeless guys who lived in my stairwell The nicest landlord in the world (even though he asked me to lie!) Electric lawn mowers And, of course, all the people I met and/or worked with, including students, teachers, and administrators. As a closing thought, I'd like to share some sentences that have amused me over the past 4 years. These are all actual samples of students' writing, and they all helped to make my job much more entertaining. I felt shiver on my spinach. I think that supermarkets are great creatures. Another thing is the possibility to wear light clothes, uncovered shoulders and half-naked paunches, which alure the man-kind. People want to read books, sink into their comfortable armchairs and sneeze. History wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to learn it. Right now we have two dogs at home (a sheepdog and a puddle). My heartiest thanks to everyone in Poland who has made me feel at home here. I never would have made it through 4 years without your help! Why yes, I am procrastinating, why do you ask? The packing & shipment of my belongings has run into a slight snag, but I'm confident (read: stressed out of my mind) it will all work out fine, and my books will eventually land somewhere near Seattle. So while I slowly come to the realization that the packing gnomes aren't going to appear & take care of things for me, I discovered a quiz for all the grammar freaks out there. And that definitely includes me. Which Punctuation Mark Are You? Enjoy, and if you happen to see the gnomes, please send them my way! "That's all your house is: a place to keep your stuff. If you didn't have so much stuff, you wouldn't need a house. You could just walk around all the time." -George Carlin I'm attempting to get rid of a considerable number of my possessions, rather than dragging them all back to Seattle with me. It's actually been easier than I expected - the more times I move, the better I am at determining what I really need, and what I only thought I needed when I bought it. There's a lot that falls into that second category. So if you're in the Poznan area, and you're feeling a need for some random kitchen items, come on by and help yourself to my stuff. I ordered a salad and a side of garlic bread at a restaurant this afternoon. I had carefully perused the menu, which said absolutely nothing about any bread being served with the salad, which is why I ordered bread to go with it. Imagine my surprise when the waitress brought me my garlic bread, my salad, and the garlic bread which came with the salad. This is actually the second time this has happened to me here. (Here as in Poland, it was a different restaurant last time.) What confuses me is why the waitress didn't tell me that bread came with the salad. Did she really think I wanted to consume half a loaf of bread with my salad? Did it not occur to her that I may not know bread was automatically included with the salad, which is why I ordered some? The menu simply lists what's in the salad, with no mention of bread. I looked. Carefully. Because this had happened to me before. I was a waitress in one of my many former occupations. If someone had ordered something which was already included with their meal, I would have told them. And I've had a waitress tell me here, too - when I asked for rice with my sweet &amp; sour chicken, I was told it was always served with rice. Apparently, it's just salads. That'll teach me to ask more questions when I order. Or to try a different restaurant. I bought a new pair of sandals a couple weeks ago, thereby guaranteeing that it would rain for the next 3 days. But when I finally wore them, it turned out they weren't the same. My toes poked out noticeably more on the left than on the right. When I bought them, one of the things I understood the sales clerk to say was that they were guaranteed for 2 years. So I decided to take them back and exchange them for 2 matching sandals. I had the receipt, I'd only worn them twice, it should be easy. Oh wait, this is Poland. I took the shoes back to the shop and showed them to the sales clerk. She agreed that there was something wrong, then showed them to her colleague, who concurred. Bring on the paperwork. I gave her my receipt, she filled out the form. She asked me whether I wanted a new pair or a refund, to which I replied that I'd like to get a new pair - I really like these sandals! I signed the form. I was then told to return in 2 weeks for the decision. 2 weeks? The decision? You mean you can't decide right now? You have to think about it? In fact, the decision is likely to be made in some corporate office, far from the shop where I spent my money for a pair of sandals which turned out to be improperly made. I now have no sandals, no refund, no decision - but I have a piece of paper and a date to discover if they'll replace my lovely new sandals. I've been discovered. As those of you who read the comments already know, one of my students has found my blog. Which likely means that ALL of my students have found my blog. Ever since I saw the comment, I've been racking my brains, trying to remember if there's anything on here I might not want students to know about me. I do kind of try to keep my personal life somewhat separate from my teaching life. But I also try not to post anything I don't want my parents to know about - yes Dad, that means you, but it's your own fault for freaking out when I happened to mention I was on antibiotics. I think I'm pretty safe. I do tend to be aware of the fact that my words can go anywhere from here. Blogging isn't private by any means. And even if I did post something I'd rather not announce to my students, it's a little late now. So to any of my students who happen by, I say, "Welcome." Please take note of the use of punctuation in the previous sentence. Unless you're in a British English group, in which case I should say, "Welcome". That just looks weird. This has been in the planning stages for a while, and it's time to let everyone in on it - I'm moving back to the States for a while. In many ways, this is an odd decision. I'm leading a fairly comfortable life here. I have job security, the nicest landlord I've ever had, and I always said I wouldn't live in the U.S. as long as W was still in office. However, I've been here for 4 years now. I haven't seen most of my family in 2 years. And I miss the comfort level that comes with living in your home culture. So, I'll be arriving in Seattle at the beginning of July. My immediate plans are to stay 1-2 years, and then very probably come back to Poland. Or maybe move to another country. Or maybe stay in Seattle longer. Or...some other option as yet unconsidered. Keep in mind, I came to Poland in 2003 with the intention of staying for 1 year. I'm not terribly good at long-term plans. My current, immediate plan is to find a teaching job in the greater Seattle area, ideally one that won't require me to acquire any additional qualifications. Do think of me if you happen to be a member of any hiring committees which are seeking an experienced, well-traveled, only slightly jaded ESL instructor.
