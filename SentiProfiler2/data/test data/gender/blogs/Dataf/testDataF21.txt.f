New Beginnings

My contract says I start on July 1st...but today, I found the familiar dance beginning. Checking with this person, that person, writing notes here, there....wondering...what implications for doing this, that... Back in the swing of things. But in a new place.
My new position. Hmmmm.....due to start in a couple days, but already, this whole thing has started. "What time will you be in?" my secretary to-be-asks. "Uh, I'll see you tomorrow....9 a.m." I say. And I mean it. Work is waiting.

I met the person who held my new post today. He had served for 17 years...the equivalent of a high school junior's lifetime...so hard to believe. I knew how I had felt, leaving Greenville after one year; Central Montcalm after 5....so how could I really know his story? Leaving after all those years. It had to be hard. He said he has plans to do "other things", yet, I know it had to about kill him. To leave things in my hands. And now, all the things he worked so hard for...will they continue, or not? 

I appreciate all he did for me. He went beyond really, what he needed to do. I don't take all that lightly. He seemed non-affected, but he had to feel a little void. And I can't blame him.
