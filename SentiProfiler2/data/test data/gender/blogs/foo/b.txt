Arriving at noon, we were instantly mesmerized by the rustic garden at its front yard, as well as the sounds of the birds at the mini-aviary. The gravel pathway led us to a an archway of vines and tree branches hanging over the front door of the restaurant, which evoked a mysterious appeal to us. Wood carvings, antique and art pieces, and dolls, caught our roving eyes.

You should absolutely NOT stop eating. This could result in horrible things that are far worse than getting fat. Just try not eating large portions, not buying so much junk food (or if you live with your parents, tell them not to buy much). Maybe try eating on a diet like the acai berry diet, or even just choosing healthy foods. If you eat a lot of smaller meals throughout the day, and eat very slowly, you''ll feel full faster. When you feel the temptation to eat in between a 'meal', drink water. It fills you up, and it''s very good for your body. But please, don't stop eating, you need to eat, your body needs the fats, and sugars for energy. If you stop, your body will start to actually break down your muscles for it's nutrients, and you'll turn into a living skeleton!! :) I hope I helped you, I really do!!!!!
Finally, we departed the station and took the nearest freeway. Since I got to see little as the bus entered the freeway I dozed off to sleep. I suddenly woke up in the middle of the trip and found myself staring at a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. The scenic spot was very serene. I was mesmerized that it was too late when I took out my camera. I tried to read any sign that would tell me the name of the place and found a Vista del Lago signage.
Finally, we entered the dining place where a row of Filipino food was set on a table. For less than P400 (less than $10), we availed ourselves of the buffet offering. There was salad, crisp spring rolls, baked clams, beef viand, and chicken viand, among other things.
“So, this is California without the skyscrapers and the malls,” I thought. We passed cities and towns like Wasco, Corcoran, Hanford, Fresno, Madera, Merced, Denair, Modesto, Stockton, Lodi, Elk Grove, Sacramento, Davis, Antioch-Pittsburg, Martinez, and Richmond until we reached Emeryville, which was one station away from the last one – Oakland. The train’s passengers were also diverse and I felt safe and grateful
I hope someday I’d be able to come back to CDO, for the nth time, and try the white water rafting adventure. Nevertheless, my first time was always memorable. It made me feel at home in CDO.  That time I was there on my first trip, I didn’t worry that I wasn’t able to tour the whole city. I knew in my heart that I would keep coming back to this place after that initial visit. And I would surely visit LimKetKai again…and explore more restaurants…and do the white water rafting…and shop more. The list is endless.
The train ride was smooth. Although there was more room at the second floor, where the dining lounge could be found, I opted to stay in the lower section with Marylou. I later found out that the lower part was reserved for senior citizens and the physically incapable. But there I was with Marylou, and the train conductor checking the tickets didn’t mind me at all, even when she got off at Hanford.
A small island was discernible from the distance, our destination for that day. For locals and divers, that was Apo Island, known for its rich underwater life.
I have just published a new book about our year long odyssey around the world: Around the World in Easy Ways, A Guide to Planning Long-Term Travel With or Without Your Kids.
Running out the door to go pick my mother up at the airport, I grab a book and bottle of water - it could be a long wait. I find this incredibly great parking space and proceed to the ticket counter in order to get a gate pass; this is my mother's first time flying as a blind person and I feel it's best if I meet her at the gate. It's only been six months since I arrived to this airport from our world travels, but somehow, even in that short period of time, they've managed to rearrange everything. I find security and line up in my cue of five - where is everyone? Isn't this the busiest travel time of the year? Why did I leave myself so much time? As the TSA agent scrutinizes my I.D. and gate pass a light bulb goes off in my head, I've got a knife in my purse. I wasn't the one traveling, so why should I have remembered to take it out of my bag? I ask the agent if there is any place to leave it for an hour or so until I come back. His lengthy reply of "No" leaves me walking back to the car to drop it off. I'm not losing this knife after finally getting it back from Easter Island!
guys do in fact lose wait faster, guys tend to have a higher metabolism and they are built to be able to gain more muscle than women i mean how many women do you see with an 8-pack let alone a 6-pack?
Last stop was the ship wreck. It wasn’t buried deep and could be seen from the surface. Some of us circled the ship and found that the corals have claimed most of the ship. It has become a home to many fishes as well, reminding me of a scene in the animation movie, Shark Tale.
The last time I visited CDO, again on a business trip and alone, I took my breakfast in this homey eating place where I also did a little shopping of beautiful household accessories and fashion trinkets. While waiting for my food to be served, I picked out a large native bag and a mat, among other things, paid for it and went back to the adjoining room where my order was invitingly sitting on the table.  The Shrimp Linguine was simply delectable while I sipped the Carrot Citrus shake.  How I loved it!
Mrs. Clinton, I work in health care and see many places where we can improve our system and still provide care for everyone. The first line of care should be the primary care physician (PCP). There are not enough doctors going into primary care to provide adequate care. The PCPs we have are overworked and overbooked. I worked as a case manager in the emergency department of a major trauma center and medical school. We cater to many of our non-funded patients, and the number of ED visits would be greatly reduced if PCPs were available to everyone. If people could get a same day or next day visit, or at least be able to contact their PCP by e-mail.
I instantly liked the mall. Some of the stores were located outdoors and not everything was housed in a giant air-conditioned building. It was modern with a provincial touch that made the ambiance friendlier than the ones we have in the capital. There was an al fresco area, but I think the mall has developed over the years since the first time I was there. I was glad I had that extra time with my friend because the day after, the workshop participants, including colleagues from our national office, started arriving. One of our hosts brought us for dinner at a steak house. The restaurant was dimly lit and cozy with a Western feel, which, for a moment, made me forget that I was in the Philippines. The dinner was sumptuous and we all had our fill.
Women are built for fat storage to be able to survive & care for children during famine. Their essential minimal fat stores are 5x higher than a males. Women were built to accumulate as much fat as possible and to not lose the accumulations for childbirth, milk production & child rearing. Having year around unlimited carbs to create fat are against the natural order.
OMG! No! Some nurse at a hospital gave unethical advice to my grandfather who is diabetic to soak his feet in water and bleach to get rid of athletes feet cracked or dry feet. After a month of listening to this retarded nurse the bleach started soaking in the cracks of his feet and cause it to open more. Later he got an infection and now has half of a foot. Bleach is for cleaning and doing laundry only! Please tell me you haven't tried this yet!
We wanted to be at the Taj by dawn the next day. This required us to leave all our belongs in the room until we returned to check out. I just knew that upon our return, anything of any value would be gone. The thought wasn't sitting well with me at all. Then I noticed the latch on the outside of the bathroom; ideas began to percolate. I retrieved a pad lock, purchased in Zanzibar, from the bottom of my bag. We placed all four of our suitcases and all four of our backpacks in the bathroom and then placed our pad lock on the outside of the bathroom door. Yes, you're picturing this right. We were locking all our belongings in the bathroom. Even if management had a key to the pad lock of our room, they still wouldn't be able to get into the bathroom. We left at 6:00 AM for the Taj Mahal feeling a little more at ease.
Sharon emailed me and told me that she would be coming back to the US in the fall for the birth of her grandchild; she would mail the knife to me at that point. But by this time I had lost all hope. It's not that I lacked faith in Sharon, it's just that I had come to believe that my knife was destined to spend the rest of it's existence on Rapa Nui - not a bad fate if I must say so myself.
What she doesn't know -- until now, because she reads the blog -- is that she has made this winter bearable for me. That early morning frosty air clears the mind. I've been able to put one foot in front of the other and march down the canal path because she has been by my side and listened to my sorrow spill out in rants and tears and Leroy stories and sometimes all three combined into one long walk. Some days, the hurt has just poured out of me.
With the high noon sun above us, it was time to take our sumptuous lunch at a nearby cottage. I took off my shoes and buried my feet beneath the smooth powdery sand.
Are you going on a trip to a particular place for the first-time? Will you be setting foot in a foreign and unfamiliar soil? This blog site is created for you. I have been to many places, and the first time I stepped into unfamiliar territory I had to feel my way and rely on what I have on-hand especially when all I had were travel books, maps and print-outs from the web. My friends and I make our own itinerary. It is truly advisable to check out anything about the place before going on a trip. Yet, you need not necessarily hire a travel agent or tour guide to get you around every time you visit a place for the first time. A little help from locals can add spice to your first-time travels. It can give you the freedom to explore the place and enjoy the feeling of not spending much, based on my own travel experiences. You can take my word on some tips and information on the places I visited but feel free to be creative and be adventurous. I may offer some advice here and there but, as they say, “experience is the best teacher”. So, read on and find out more about my first-time travel adventures.
Sahuayo was affected by the Cristero War of 1926 - 1929. The Cristero War was the most significant relapse to violence and conflict after 1917. It arose from the clergy and traditionalist groups protesting the anti-Catholic policies of the Constitution. The Constitution sought to secularise the country and limit the power of the church. The Constitution prohibited the chucrh from aquiring land, banned monastic orders and church-run schools and forbad any religious activity outside View of the Santuary of Guadalupe of churches (now the property of the government).
Malatapay Beach Resort may be far from the city but it is accessible to the national highway. It has a beautiful location with cottages close to the sea facing Apo Island, a strategic spot to serve as a gateway to the tourist-attractive island. They have several cottages that can accommodate a large group (we were 16 all in all when we went there).
Once our trip was over, I figured our blog was over too. Not that I really wanted it to end (the trip or the blog); it's just that in my mind, they went hand in hand. Sure, people will check in to see great safari pictures or to hear about our trials and tribulations on the road, but who is going to check the blog now that we are here back in the US living our normal everyday lives. I guess there are a few people out there who might be interested in hearing about our reentry into "real" life, but probably not many.
As we entered Farmerbrown, the place was packed so we had to wait to be seated. I scanned the place and I could tell that the dimly lit restaurant was cozy enough. It has a charm that I couldn’t describe much in words. Jazz music filled the air that balanced the chatter, which could be heard by the bar where friends and strangers meet up. Near the tall glass window, families were having a reunion of sort. In the middle and at the other side of the restaurant, the ambiance was a bit subdued, where couples and small groups were enjoying their dinner quietly.
And the young people, lots of them, not all sorority types either; young, fresh and still susceptible to the allure of so much manufactured glamour. Ironically they and their indomitable youth add sauce and substance to the myth. They flesh it out and give it life.
When I got off at Emeryville, I instantly located the bus bound for San Francisco. In less than an hour we were crossing Bay Bridge, passing over Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Alcatraz and the San Francisco city line came into view. We went around San Francisco in six drop off points before we reached the shopping center. I even enjoyed the mini-tour around downtown, the financial district, and the wharf because I got to see other parts of San Francisco that I hadn’t seen previously. Time passed by so quickly. In a few hours, I was in SFO checking in my luggage. But I was glad that in my short stay in the US, I was able to embark on an Amtrak adventure.
It was a long drive and if we weren’t careful, we could have missed the small path at our left which leads to Kusina Salud. It would be convenient to go there by private vehicle because the restaurant was a bit secluded.
Besides a couple shots of delicious meals and desserts consumed and neatly arranged market produce encountered during my travels, I rarely take many food photographs, but the next few weeks will find me photographing a variety of raw meats, poultry, and seafood for a new non-travel related client based in Nigeria so I’m pretty excited about this venture.
Around me courses humanity, in all it’s incorrigible shapes and forms. I even find people like me, people you’d never expect to see here in the Vegas of my media fed imagination. To my surprise there is no one particular type dominating here. I see one salon tanned bottle blonde in a tight short black skirt holding a cigarette but next to her, not with her, but sharing her milieu, is a French couple, perfectly Parisian in their understated elegance.
What was even exciting in our Coral Garden snorkeling activity was we saw a tortoise swimming near us. We had to be careful not to scare it away or we might impose some stress level on this marine animal.
We were at the Union Station by 6:30, an hour before the designated schedule. We walked over the counter to show my online reservation. I asked the guy manning the counter if I would have any difficulty with my luggage or if I need to check it in. He took one look at me and my bags (there was a trolley bag, a backpack, and a shoulder bag) and shrugged, “you’ll do just fine.” He also explained that there was one leg in my itinerary wherein checking in my luggage wasn’t an option, so it would be best if I would just carry them with me. Anyway, there would be baggage compartments where I could deposit my things.
I'd like to see every citizen of the United States guaranteed basic health care at reasonable prices. We claim to be advanced, enlightened, the best country in the world, and yet our citizens often go without medical care because they can't afford it - or can't afford the health insurance. The insurance provided through my job is a flat rate regardless of how many people it covers. I am single, no dependents, and yet my insurance premiums cost the same as a co-worker with a family of five. At one point, between jobs, I tried to get independent insurance coverage and was refused because of my weight. I was within their acceptable weight range (which was only 17 pounds higher than the upper "healthy" limit for my height), but because I had recently lost 30 pounds they refused me and told me to try again in six months, so they could "be sure I'd keep the weight off." I've visited insurance companies as part of my previous job. I've seen the 40 acre professionally landscaped site with walking paths and lakes. I've eaten in the executive lunch rooms and employee cafeterias that served better food than most restaurants I've been to. I've seen the three story fountains in the lobby, and I know one company in particular that as a matter of policy closes its doors at noon on Fridays in the summer. When my premiums go to fund the insurance company's private fitness club, I have a problem.
And that's it, remember these 5 key areas and your golden, you'll be miles ahead of 99% of guys out there and finally be able to attract and date that beautiful girl you've been spying on for the past few months.
Now don't get me wrong, women don't want you to walk up to them and immediately start acting like a sex crazed maniac, but they do want you to open up SOMETIME. Unfortunately most guys never realize this and assume that if they are friendly for long enough something sexual will *just happen*. The truth is it doesn't *just happen* unless you make it happen (remember women want to be lead). Usually if you've met a woman out clubbing/through friends and have spent over 20 hours with her and you haven't yet kissed, your going to be a friend forever (of course this doesn't apply if you work/study with her). Generally it's best to start flirting with a girl as soon as you're even slightly comfortable around each other (after knowing each others names). This sets the tone of the interaction immediately and lets her know that you are a sexual guy who she could possibly date, not another guy to be placed into the "just friends" category.
Should have the gallery up in a few days. Not sure how I’ll photograph Vienna since the last time I was there, every boring angle of statues, buildings, and museums was duly captured on film. Yes, the property was lavish, attention was paid to every single detail, and the staff was extraordinarily warm so trying to pick apart the hotel and keep digging for negatives when there were clearly no significant misses would be an injustice on my part – personal preferences aside.
well,... wt do i say abt this sweet short gal???!!!! she is a very nice girl basically... very understandin.... always has time for others or rather makes time for friends..... big time brain.... n a true friend... doesnt get angry very fast... n ya typical 'tamilian',,...
So, I've been asking k for a new ring with my birthstone in it ever since my old one got yucky and gave my ring finger a weird looking wrinkle. He has tried all techniques that husbands employ -- agreeing and then pretending that he forgot, plain dilly-dallying, pretending to focus on blank spot with more intensity, changing the topic to li'l r (This is a good one, I fall for it almost all the time), asking me about myself or my blogs (This one works well too), throwing in random related questions, "Yeah, you think we should check out the rings in the mall?" and then, "What's for dinner?" He is too smart to refuse because he knows the consequences of said refusal but at this point I am weary and annoyed that my delicate ring finger still does not sport a glittering sapphire (or whatever my birth stone is) ring shining with the promised love of our marriage. And so, I tried a different tactic the other night:
Once a software engineer, now a full time mom having fun with my two year old:)I believe in making young children learn through play. Just like we sneak veggies in the food, you sneak something on to the head while playing:)So, this blog is a collection of all the activities me and my son do together. Thanks for stopping by and if you do try some of these with your kids, let me know:)
hy does this happen? Because, men don't cry or break down. Instead, the more upset they are, the more they frown or the angrier they appear. Now, we all know women are more attractive than most men. And, nobody feels sorry for an angry man. In fact, the angrier he gets, the uglier he looks, the more despicable he appears. What choice does he have really? If he cries, they'll call him sissy. They'll say he's wuss. And it's not really macho. So he does what he has to. Pretend he's got buffalo-skin.
Wow. Deep breath. I have so much to tell you, evidently. Today we went for Sunday lunch at the Polo Club, owned by the drummer for The Who, and THEN, Ronnie Wood walked in. (I'll give you a minute. Did you hear crickets? I did.) Ronnie Wood is one of the guitarists for The Rolling Stones and okay, so it wasn't Mick Jagger, but it was still quite exciting. JC's mother pointed him out to us, with his very young girlfriend and do you mind if I segue into a little rant about the English girls I've been seeing with very bare legs and shoulders and how I look at them with horror and envy, half wanting to be them, confident that it isn't really thaaaaaaaaaaaat cold, or be that age again, when vanity took precendence over comfort.
Don't know why I am writing this.. but I feel like writing this...why is that everytime i read a post here, i am relating it with a page in my life? why is that every time, i m reminded of my dad or mom when i read anything out here.. reason- all of us- we go through same phases in life.. emotions are the same! 
bt the bizziare thing abt this post is tht- i have never had much friends too.. i was, guess all the time, in my own world.. at school- nt many kids used to talk to me- coz i always used to in these music or drama kind of activities.. for some reason other kids found tht to be some kind of strange thing.. i was an alien species among the "mark/grade hungry" crowd... it became the opposite while at college! so, i have never had much people whom i could call friends..

So many times in life mom had come across groups of individuals who would come and advise her on how to do things. Then another will say whatever she had been doing would be wrong and that she has to start over. At different points in time in life. Now there are people that tell me that I should not be on this blogging/tweeting scene and that there should be more exclusivity. And that a musician needs to maintain the distance. Sometimes I feel that they are right. Considering some comments I get, I wonder why people are so obsessed with obscenities and the related but why should I be subject to all this is their question. Yes it does make sense several times. But if and when I don't blog, it would perhaps be because I have tired of this medium of expression and there would be a proper goodbye. I don't see it happening for now but the thing is, no matter what you do, there will be tons of free advice. And in Oscar Wilde's words "I alwayspass on good advice. It's the only thing to do with it. It is never any use to oneself." 
CSI has provided us with bad debt collections since January of 2005.
   We are very pleased with the results that CSI has given us. Our accounts are transferred to them electronically, and we receive monthly payments and reports from them.
   We have never had a patient complaint about about their treatment from CSI. The only complaints we have found are usually pertaining to billing insurance/co-pay issues. They understand healthcare receivables and we have a most satisfactory relationship with them.
I would highly recommend CSI to any healthcare organization.

The couple decided to get married at court and have a day long party after that. We met Small and Mr Small (who really deserves his own name here, but I can't think of one at the moment, so Mr. Small it is) at one of London's oldest pubs, The Prospect Of Whitby. So old that it even has its own Wikipedia page! Coolness. The pub was delightful, we had the upstairs 'Pepys Room' all to ourselves, a wedding party of about twenty people, foreigners and Indians and it overlooked the Thames. Interestingly, the room we were in was once used for cock fighting and boxing matches, which made me think of Sherlock Holmes , which in turn made me think of Robert Downey Jr with his shirt off. Good times.

Firstly, I congratulate you on winning the prestigious Booker prize. It is a remarkable achievement indeed for a young first-time novelist.

I started reading “White tiger” but was straight away baffled by a work in English that begins, “Neither I nor you speak any English, but there are some things that can only be said in English”. Why would a major work in the English language adopt the epistolatory voice of someone who does not know the language and be addressed to someone else who does not know both English and the language spoken by the letter writer, I wondered. But, that is not why I am writing to you. 

I have read much about how you came to write this book. You have been quoted as saying,” So, where's this Shining India everyone's talking about? It was time someone broke the myth," and that “The world needed to see the other side of India."
It makes me uncomfortable when people talk across cubicles in restrooms. I don't know if men do this as well. I know some women at my office who are "restroom buddies". They enter the restrooms chatting away about something and continue their conversations from the stalls as they do their business. No matter that they might not even be in adjacent stalls! For someone caught in the crossfire of this talk, it is totally awkward. Can't they wait until after they've left the restrooms to talk?

It is a quiet Friday morning. Sitting by the window in his bedroom, Sankaran watches the street bustling with activity. Men hurrying to work, children walking to school, and women, busy with their daily chores – some sending off their husbands and children, a few rushing to work themselves, some getting back from the temple. He also sees the old men and women warming up their feet for the day. Even as the world goes on with its life at a hectic pace, Sankaran has very little to do, at least that morning.

That's how r~ says "Happy" when the "Happy Birthday" song plays on TV. When I turned 30, I acted like the typical drama queen -- resisting, reminiscing, wondering how this chunk of my life would turn out. But the big three-oh turned out to be fine mostly and in addition to a little love bundle in my arms, I managed to get a book out there. Check, check (as Monica would say). And now, I am at that crossroads again wondering what this year will bring. A published novel would be nice. It would be reaaallly nice. And then I would be one of those cool moms who could claim that they took care of their baby while working from home on something they were passionate about. But, I am not that mom now. I am just a mom who is turning a year older who is dreaming big dreams while her little one continues to throw delightful little challenges her way and melt her heart with her love (I could talk a lot more about r~ but I'll reserve that for my secret mommy blog ;)
Hi suriya,
Really happy to have a frnd like u. Very cool, always smiling, charming girl. I like ur way of talking. u became close with me very soon. I luv u dear
Steffi is my chweet n darling sis. she is cute , loving n soooo very adorable!...a chatter box who always eats my head. I really miss her now that am not at home!
I guess not every person in this world is blessed to have a sister like her. She is some one I look upto! Though she fights with me a lot (in which I win most of de times), she is the best…..very helpful and kind in nature…has always helped me with my studies. A mega brain, not nice to have her as a senior in school (with teachers all de time praising…blah..blah)…Thank God I got rid of her now (just joking!!) She is crazy of books and luvs 2 eat junk food all de time. she‘s got a lovely hair which I am very jealous of! Indeed she is a book worm.
She is a pink gal….looooooooves pink…rite frm her pens n wallets to her ipod, everything is pink! Thank God…she hasn’t seen a pink car yet she is a real kiddo…she still has a craze for Barbie dolls…OMG!

STEFFI I LUV U. U R THE BEST GIFT GOD HAS EVER GIVEN ME!!!
sriram!!!!!! hmmm! it took me jus hardly few days to get close enough to him! one shy guy he s! but ppl note he is an awesome company!!! never knows how the time flies off chattin with him! though he is a kid as i see him that way, i have learned a lot from him! very cute, innocent and studious are a few words i use to describe him! and very bad at fooling ppl;) i can say that he is one person i have got really close to in a very short span of time! and guess ntn can hinder our frenship!!!! and ya he has a small heart is wat he says without measurin;)! haha! u can rely on this chap! sriram thanks for everything and find your sitha soon! my wishes for u!!
There are a few things which characterise my friendship with Anoosha -
1) We simply have to fight every week. If at all we miss one week, we'll have an extra ferocious fight to compensate . This constitutes the most important part of our bonding 
2) We also have to have a mutual ego boosting session, where we compliment each other( coz noone else seems to do so)
3) We have to text each other everyday, even the most inane details of what we're doing- "I'm in the bus", "I'm in the train", "I'm bored", "So am I" etc. If this doesn't happen on a day to day basis, read point (1). Dishoom dishoom
Probably the best thing about my friendship with her is that I don't have to pretend..I can straight away say to her face what I think of her, and she returns the favour too :)
I personally feel that no relationship/friendship is ever complete without a fight, because you require that intimacy even to fight..That said, I'm gonna miss our weekly fights when this idiot runs away to do her MS. Love U!
hmmm..charanya or charanga..watever u call her..she is d first lady of our class n dept..she is one person who ll have somethin to tell u 24 hrs a day all days a week..classes r never borin (how much ever the profs try makin thm borin) if u r next to her..she was the padips of our class but now out all that nonsense..she always has a reason for watever she tells though the reasons r mostly(nope always;) ) insane!!! she has been a carin,sweet n very entertainin..life rocks wit u pal :)..
charangs..i find it hard to put down in words(that too a max of 1024 chars) about this wonderful person who happens to be one of my close friends..we've had loads of fun in coll,most of the times at her expense..shes one person i can talk to bout anything under the sun..heres to u..my friend, my confidant..as cliched as it sounds,im sure our friend'ship' will never sink or stink!
Listless eyes fixed aimlessly on the road. The dry hum of the AC blowing on my face. One long never ending road. The slow monotony of a highway drive. Many kilometres covered. Mindless music crooning in the background. Every mile seemed to me like the road was gobbling up human beings, villages and vehicles alike. The road swallowing the people and things that it passed by in seconds. The car swallowing the road as it moved ahead. The vicious cycle kept replaying before my eyes and suddenly brought a memory to the forefront . A memory that tore its way from that place , deep inside mind, where it was locked away for eternity. The loud screaming thoughts rudely shook my reprieve and replaced the stoic silence of my mind.
en years back
kids playing cricket on the street
monisha: i wanna play along with you

okie arch felt a lot that i dint write much in her slam book .. so making it up 2 u this way .. wat to tell about this sweet samathu angel faced gal ( i mean it really u know ) well lots because as the saying goes appearences are deceptive . The only one in the A gang who holds the record for never getting caught in class inspite of sitting next 2 shah .. what she does , well i doubt if she knows herself . to talk archa's trademarks , bad bad handwriting , few salwars that atleast one other person will own , some so different that they can give ksh's designer wear a run , matching earrings to give appu competition. Very tolerant person ( after all she tolerated the THIRD one for many sems and had nightmares resulting from it ) . No one can beat her in word racer , though i doubt her counter strike abilities . Snoopy like nancy drew which provide good base material for gossip .. her luck ( well i would rather not remind her of it ) .. wat els movie buff book-a-maniac and pakki of first order
Pre-r (which is how I am going to call my pre-parent days), I used to notice one common characteristic among parents. Whenever they had their baby with them, they would try to convince the baby to do something fascinating like saying the alphabets or singing a song or even dancing a particular piece. It almost never worked. The kid would look shy and hide behind the parent or would just look blank and do nothing. I would excitedly wait for the kid to do its wonder but couldn't help wondering what made the parents want so desperately for the kid to perform. I believed them, that the kid can say its alphabets or sing a little jingle or tap dance; then why the attempts to coerce the unwilling kid to do that?
Its like yesterday, but I can still remember the day i first met you.It was August 19,2005 around noon.We were all gathered for the first year's orientation day.At first sight itself you waved at me like a very old friend and introduced yourself to me and i was amazed.This is how it all started. I never thought i would be really this close to you as you had many friends in college. But you took the initiative and made sure that I was comfortable with you.
Sumi can read your mind just like that. A very true and a loyal friend to have. She is unpredictable at certain times. Dont try to mess up with her feelings. Just accept the way she is and you will be really surprised to see a very different person altogether. She can be silly and intelligent at the same time. I wonder how she can watch a movie all night and still manages an 80 in the next day's test. She makes a boring class very lively by her constant doubts.
Hey SUMI you are the best i have ever had.I will do my best to make you feel the same way!..

Maha is a bundle of energy. Loves to have fun, enjoys life to the fullest and then of course - lives for the present (pun intended ;-). Down to earth, believes in a heap load of her own "principles" !!! Good sense of humour and a shweeet smile. It definitely pays to be in her good books :-)))
And who better to write this testimonial than me - her anbu thangatchi !! Aint I lucky ?!? Cos Manjuu..u r simply the best.
There are serials, mindless game shows, cloying "reality" dance shows, movies, movies and more movies. They debuted "Adaverallam Aada varalaam" recently. The preview shows this guy who injures himself on the dance floor. Prithviraj (aka Babloo) is begging the show's judges to let him be taken to the hospital. Huh?! The injured guy comes up with a really stupid line like, "All warriors want to fall on the battlefield. I'd rather die on stage than go to the hospital." Second huh?!!!!!!! Okay, drama queen, if you want to die on-stage, that's your problem. But we don't want to see it.  Of course, its all coached "reality TV" lines. Still, who comes up with such crap at Sun TV?

She ll do anything for frens..She ll kalachify ppl like anything..If she says something, we shld have a closer look on it, cos it wont be the same what we assume She always thinks very practical....She is punctuality personified..Very lucky to get such a awesome fren like Mathura..Be the way u r !!

This week in home video, we've got a slew of brand new releases coming your way. Unfortunately, only a few of them were critical darlings, but the ones that are critic-approved are pretty good ones. Among the new releases are the latest in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, the most recent offering from Disney's traditional animation department, a couple of action flicks that didn't perform as well as they would have liked, a computer animated update of an anime classic, director Pedro Almodovar's latest film, and a boxset of a brutal South Korean trilogy. Dig in, and hopefully there'll be something worth your while this week!
Regular readers of this blog, and I am happy to say that it as many as five people, have been pointing out that it has remained unupdated for over two months. A very devoted reader, horror of horrors, even threatened blogultery, if I did not come up with a post soon. I know how hard I have toiled to build readership to such impressive levels and I feel terrified at the prospect of losing it all.

I do have a good reason for not blogging. I was away on a holiday for three weeks and while I did contemplate writing about it, I decided against doing so. What, I felt, could I possibly say about London that hasn’t already been said? After all, the very wonderful city attracts an impressive 30 million tourists every year.
XPU Ha Don´t worry be happy from David Furchtgott on Vimeo . As we were driving into our house, I was listening, to the song " Don´t Worry , be Happy ", and, It is unbelievable, to think back, and to see how much we have achieved out of a dream... we started of a tree in Xpu Ha, just sitting down with a kite waiting for the wind, planning to have a Sabatical season... and look where we are now... Thank you very much for the support! I´m looking forward to see what is next! Keep it Real, Keep it Morph! Thank you Ben, for taking the time to shoot this pictures and also edit them in your holidays! very nice!, he was taking this pictures side by side with Chantelle, he was " embarrased " to give me this pictures, because he says that he can not compete with Chantelle´s session, however, I told him, that every photographer has a pint of view, also that he doesn´t have the big monster camera as Chantelle does, but his pictures are awesome as well, and every picture is different, every eye is deifferent, so Ido appreciate a lot your pics Ben! when I took him a picture to post in the blog, he says : don´t take a picture of e I´m going to be horrible in that picture..... I took the picture of him and when he saw it, he told me: you see? JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU....HORRIBLE!!! JAJAJA! anyway MOn Ami, Merci Beaucoup!!! saludos! este dia nos sopló bastante bien, el viento, estaba más o menos como 15 nudos de dirección Noreste, Yanick, empezó a armar su EH Beast V3, de 6 m2, mientras yo le ayudaba a estirar sus líneas. esto fue en la escuela de kitesurfing de Morph en la playa de Xpu Ha, Yanick vino con varios de sus amigos de Cancun, pero él fué el único que continuó con su entrenamiento. hoy seguimos con el trainer, y Yanick ya tiene muchísimo control con su papalote! ahora ya está dando giros, vueltas, kiteloops! etc, al final de la tarde nos terminamos la arrachera, y fué un buen final de dia en Xpu ha... Andrés, fué el fotógrafo de éste dia. thank you very much por las fotos Amigo! and also thank you for the Tacos de Carnitas! that was a nice experience! saludos! Buenas Tardes David, I trust you are well and business is growing! It was great meeting you on the beach in January. I had a lot of fun photographing you kiteboarding and listening to your passionate words about your sport. You're setting a powerful example. I would have liked to have accepted your invitation for lessons before leaving on our journey to weave together the prophecies of the Maya and Inka at the sacred sites of Tulum, Coba, Chichen Itza, and Ek Balam. I didn't have the space to stop by this time and will build room into my schedule when I return. It was pretty different, almost difficult, coming back to Sweden with a temperature of -20 C compared to the +28 C in Tulum. Three journeys to Tulum in the last 15 months and looking forward to returning as soon as possible. You have a beautiful country and the land speaks to me. It would be cool to meet up with some kiteboarding folks here in Stockholm. I appreciate any connections you may have. Thank you. As agreed David, here are some of the photos that I took that afternoon. They are small at 72dpi to keep the email size low. Left me know if you would like any in a larger size. I join ed Morph Kiteboarding group on FB when I saw it the other day. Warm regards, Scott as I´m coming out of the Xpu Ha Palapa, I see Francoise, writting something, as I approach I can spy that he is studying the wind window! good for you man! I love to see people thirsty for knowledge! I actually don´t even think he knows I took his picture.. saludos ! Nokia Morph Concept from Ozan Basar on Vimeo . Read more about... Cia Cucoritza! thank you Zoltán for this amazing set!
Post note: Little bunny died about three hours after I brought him in house. I'm sure the stress was just too much for him. He seemed to be picking up some speed at one point. It is all for the better. He was warm and cared for. I found a wounded bunny near a hay pile I was moving by the lamb stalls this morning. He had tucked himself into the safest spot he could, and squeaked when I was near by. His hind leg has a puncture wound, through to the bone. He's alive, but I've had my Dr. Quinn episodes with bunnies, wildlife doesn't fare well with human interference even when well intended. I imagine a cat got him. I iodined it after saline bath. He is more alert than when I found him, and I have him at my desk safe from puppies and wandering felines. Not sure if he will make it. He'll die attended though, although the sounds of the dogs playing is probably not helping. He is calm when held. The wandering array of life continues, as does pending death. These little episodes are not meant to distress, but to remind us of the bigger picture. Life is temporary, and can be snapped away in a bite by man or beast. The conflict of having compassion for but raising livestock to sustain me, the conflict of helping a bunny that eats my food...intertwined. Lilly had her lambs last night. She finally started labor around six p.m. and we came to the barn a few times to find her still in pre labor. This early morning we arrived to find lambs, two beauties. The male is very large, and already eating a little grass this usually doesn't happen for a few days or more.] The girl is this wonderful strawberry blonde. Sadly, on my second trip to the barn, she had torn her eyelid on a piece of the lambing pen - I treated with saline and antibiotic and think it will heal fine. Lilly is one of our work horse sheep - always calm, and stoic. She's a big girl who throws strong lambs. I was concerned she had held out this long, as we never have lambs past 3/12...and of course my over active imagination drummed up all sorts of possibilities. I tortured myself by re-reading my sheep books about possible causes, and lay in bed last night with visions of Lilly lying in breach birth trauma...but I guess Mlle. Nature just wasn't ready to pop those two out, and they arrived very mature - with ears already standing by morning. Normally I wait at least one day to put mom and lambs out, but it's sunny and warm, and Lilly is an old pro. It's less stressful than being separated from the flock. They develop so much faster - I find - when they can go outside. I want to thank all the nice thoughts people held for us this season- I have to say, I feel like a boulder has been lifted off my chest. The trauma of last year really made a mark on me, and Martyn, and it showed this season. We lost the stillborn girl, and I still fret about the surviving twin's rattle, but all in all, we are pleased. And relieved. As the last ewe to lamb, Lilly rests, and waits. And one of Audrey's boys catches some sunny zzzzz's. On what most likely was a chilly March 10th in 1958, in a hospital room at St. Mary's in Rochester, Minnesota, I came bolting into the world at precisely 10:18 PM. And so begins the story which over the years has reached mythical proportions- how I almost killed my mother on my birthday. Perhaps it is one reason I chose to never have children - my own mother terrified the heck out of me with my own birth story. In all seriousness, my mother did almost bleed to death, and I have this scar she likes to point out on my forehead from the momentous occasion. Supposedly my father looked pale and upset when he saw me because I was pink and red and lobster like, where as my brother came out a year earlier looking like JFK - seriously, for years my mother compared my brother's looks to JFK. I was compared to a lobster. And hours before I barged out of the womb, my father had been called to the morgue, where his 57 year old mother lay dead, of a heart attack, diabetes related. Her untimely death led me to receive her name, Katherine, instead of Bridgette which my mother had picked out. I cant imagine being named Bridgette, although as a child I liked to tell this story, since Bridgette Bardot was all the rage, and as a chubby little redhead, I thought BB was quite the cat's pajamas. So I can only imagine the yin and yang and surreal quality of that cold March night for my father. I wonder if there were things that brought it all back to him as he aged. Did the sound of heels on a linoleum floor late at night bring back a sensation of the events he dealt with that night? As I get older, 52 years older to be exact, I can understand how this moment is burned into my mother, or father, in some kind of post traumatic stress way. But being true Minnesotans, we carried on, and every year, my mother made me one of my favorite layer cakes- at the time it was white cake with pink butter frosting. In time, my tastes changed to German chocolate, or her white cake with chocolate frosting. I still have the same recipe cards she hand wrote so many years ago, all spotted with vanilla stains. While I appreciate that I was born, I am not one of the people out there saying that birth is beautiful. In fact, I couldn't disagree more. It's an intimate moment of a mother creature being out of control of her body. Miraculous, yes, but not beautiful. I get just about as much birth as I need on the farm, thank you very much , and all the blood, after birth and vaginal prolapses that come with it. I think birth is traumatic, terrifying, bloody and completely chaotic. It's a mess. In fact, it makes no sense. A creature pushed out of a keyhole - that's not beautiful, it's bizarre. It's a miracle, but it's not beautiful. But it's the only way to get a foot in the door, isn't it? Staying in a womb all your life would be safe, and warm, and inexpensive - no taxes, no maniacs on the radio shouting at you. But there would be no grand entrance, no kisses, no pie made with the first strawberries, no front row seats to Neil Young. No puppies. No showers on a hot day. No hand to hold when a father dies and no little mouths to feed when a mother dies. No matter what creatures come into your life, mothering is the beautiful part of birth. That some one would go through that trauma to give another creature a way to get their foot in the door of this big, messy place called life. The winds have come in, it's bone chilling. All day I was carried back to a place I liked to hide when I was little, a grove of sumac bushes out behind our house. Alone, I felt protected, but spooked at the same time. Rushing back to the house, I'd hear the wind blowing buckets and roof tops, and it felt scary like the Wizard of Oz. But home was warm, there was homemade cake even on my non birthday. It wasn't messy. It's like that today - the sounds of the barn roof rattling in the wind are spooky, but I feel safe in the barn, surrounded by my mothering ewes. Together with my flock, I experienced the trauma of last year's lambing, and just like my mother did after my birth, I carry that trauma with me in a little surface wound, in danger of getting reopened if I bump it just right. I realized it's my very own birth story, and it's required if one expects to find a sense of place in this messy world. March 10, Post Note: Daisy presented my with two healthy lambs this morning, a perfect way to start my birthday. They've made it 8 hours...we'll hope they do well tonight. They appear okay. I saw some tail wiggling while at the udder [ asign they are getting milk]. When I saw these pictures, I was quite amused at their expressions. Amazing how they adapt. We are grateful for the sun and warmer weather, to help our lambing week along. These are Fern's lambs, now one week old. We had hoped more of the girls would lamb this weekend - perfect weather. I knew everyone of the 5 ewes was ready to pop, but I like to keep them up and atom until they really go down into labor. The new mothers can surprise you though - I once had a new mom waddling casually back to the barn with her baby half way out. So last night I was pretty sure Nelly Moser would lamb. And she did. I have been somewhat concerned about what type of mother Nelly would be- of all our sheep she is somewhat flighty. Arriving at the barn, there she was with two fresh lambs, probably born around 8 am. But she wasn't caring to them very proficiently- she wasn't licking them or chortling much. One was quite dopey looking and chilled, not a good sign. I checked her udder and she had milk, and both ram lambs did suck on my finger, another good sign. I opted not to tube them [a procedure where you insert a stomach tube and force feed], and gave him milk from my finger instead. I decided to take them outside since it is sunny and much warmer outside than the cool barn. Nelly was just a bit clueless, but she's adapting. She is chortling more, and can get them to the udder, but she's not as good as the pros at helping them 'get it". She did not dry them off well either, and I had to step in and help. Within a half hour, I had them warmed up, thanks to the towel and the sun. We will just have to watch them and see. In the last 3 hours, I think both mother and lambs are adjusting to the newness of everything. And the other girls wait...here's Lilly, who I'm sure will go soon. In fact, they are all showing signs of pending labor. The rules of this game are simple: wait...watch...then run with all your heart to where ever the guy in front of you runs.
