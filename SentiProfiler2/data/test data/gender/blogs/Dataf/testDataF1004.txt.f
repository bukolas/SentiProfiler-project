I picked her up on Saturday, after a night of lots of partying and little sleeping. Yes, I'm gangster. We didn't get home until 5 in th morning on Sunday. We had lots of fun. We kayaked, shopped, tried on tons of clothes in a co-ed dressing room (I got caught by a male worker in my bra, then later, dancing retardedly - sweet! as in, embarrassing), went on rescue missions with the boys (rescued a boat load of unshaven, smelly, barefoot.. hippies! The stinkiest rescue mission of all time, thanks Bob!), got pedicures, paddled at midnight to see phosphorescence, oogled hot guys, barbecued at Jays, crashed a dinner party at Tugboat Annies...  and I even got away with some stuff that I'd never have gotten away with if Joshlynn wasn't there. Like taking pictures of ourselves in the round mirror in the middle of the marina store.
