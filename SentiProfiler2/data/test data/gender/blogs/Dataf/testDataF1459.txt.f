ok so maybe my once a week isn't turning out the way i had hoped....but it's not like i haven't thought about blogging! i have. in fact! i kept a pink post it note going on what i needed to blog about. it's full. so this will probably be pretty long.

first on the list: i don't have enough guy friends. i don't necessarily have a LOT of friends. (real friends anyway). but i definitely think i need more male friends. less drama. more laughs. and they generally don't get upset when you haven't hung out "in forever".

second: i got netflix!! i loooooove it!! seeing a bunch of movies i've wanted to see but haven't. and it's cheaper. plus i can watch stuff online (too bad i don't have internet....). which brings me to point 3. dexter. best tv show ever!!! omg. it's disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. brilliant. i'm obsessed. finished season 1 and am on episode 6 of season 2. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful dramas. but if you don't like the F word...maybe steer clear. it's shown on showtime and not cable so....but it's great!!

fourth: have you ever felt like telling someone to suck it??? cause i have. a lot lately. i truly want to look at someone i can't stand and forcefully say "suck it." maybe throw in a bitch at the end too if i'm feeling really vengeful. i'm sick of the hypocrisy and dumb assed-ness. (<-totally made up that awesome word just now). but in all seriousness....i want a lot of people to pull their heads out their asses.

fifth: i live next door to Danville. it's a place for old people. it helps them find affordable housing and care and what not. but i think a lot of old/homeless people live in the building as well. anyway....either someone is about to croak, or they did b/c for the past week the fire dept has been there every night. i stand on the balcony and watch them. which brings me to point 6. wouldn't it be great if a firefighter looked up and saw someone watching them and decided to introduce them self and they fell in love and what not??? not saying me of course. it was just a crazy thought i had. then my next thought was, what a great novel! someone should get on writing that. stat.
