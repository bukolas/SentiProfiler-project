You are a liar. The statments "On this page you will find a nice collection of the worst ones" and "During the period that I have worked on my...project, I have recieved tons of both support and offensive mail...I have collected most of the offensive mail," are both lies. If these are the WORST ones, then why are these peoples messages on there?

For the claim that you have recieved TONS of both supportive and offensive mail, I wouldn't call 25 supposed "hate" letters tons, and why don't you put any supportive mail on your site? Maybe you don't get any? Just so you'll post this on your page:

Death to the blacks, jews, latinos, gays, etc.
