I've been thinking about things. I've been thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my life, and I've decided that I want to take (at least) a picture a day so I can have photo albums filled with pictures by the time I'm (old enough to be?) a grandparent. And maybe then when I die (because I slightly obsess over death), people will be like, "Woah, look at her life." Or think I was a complete nut job (which I sort of am). And you know what? I'm totally cool with that.
