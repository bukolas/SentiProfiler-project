apologies for the long absence... i think that i just needed to fall off the planet after all the mayhem and recuperate for the gruelling last four years... so as you guys are all probably aware i have been trying my hand at things other than shooting... so have been doing a few commercials, giving speeches, been doing a lot of stuff with my dogs, have been busy in the office with a few projects and it has been amazing been staying away from the shooting range...although i have to admit that i do feel a twinge of desire to go and shoot everytime i walk past the range but i am going to make sure that i am completely rested and relaxed both physically and mentally before i decide to venture down that road...it has been a long and ardous last couple of months and i am happy to have some normalcy returning to my life... my phone no longer ringing off the hook and things are great....i hosted my coaches to india for the first time and have been busy taking them around...so we made the trip to agra, and jaipur and it was great actually hanging out with them and not talking that much shooting...so guys fret not...will keep all informed regularly... at least everytime i have news and that may not be as often as you guys like :) but hey i am just a simple guy living in a mundane existence...
