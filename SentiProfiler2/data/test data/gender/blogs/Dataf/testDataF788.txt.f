Precious kept me on the edge of my seat. I liked this movie because I like the movies that make you become a part of them. This movie was very intense as it showed the true feelings of being molested while someone just stands by and then blames you for it. It also showed how to overcome that and move up and mature through it. I had strong feeling of anger towards this mother but had to realize that this mother had emotional problems too.
