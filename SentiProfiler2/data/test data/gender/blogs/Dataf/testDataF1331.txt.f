first love...first sex I should say...when your whole body explodes...burns... when you feel hungry, thirsty... when all your senses are multiplied bu 100 or 1000 or... when you don't know what day it is, what time it is... then life goes on... other loves, other bodies, journeys.... but I'm still starving... naked... waiting... each time is the first time...

Thank you Frida, you really were a true wild woman... wish I could dance, just like the old Sedna the day before she died...the old Saame...she took her magic drum, stood up and started dancing...and suddenly she was twenty...the younger women then realized they didn't have to fear old -age... being lonely, so lonely, never being right, never acting right...always having to behave, never being allowed to be myself, having to be the best pupil, the best girl, transparent... working with Creative Therapy... IT has been related to me, O happy King, said Shahrazad, that there was a certain merchant who had great wealth, and traded extensively with surrounding countries; and one day he mounted his horse, and journeyed to a neighbouring country to collect what was due to him, and, the heat oppressing him, he sat under a tree, in a garden, and put his hand into his saddle-bag, and ate a morsel of bread and a date which were among his provisions. ...................... I didn't know I would ever be able to tell about it, but it really looked like one thousand and one nights...
