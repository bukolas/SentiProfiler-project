We all seem to divide our lives up into different sections.  Some go by relationships, some by children, some by jobs, debt, or even cars.  Today, I think the world is asking me to step into a new section of life and I'm not sure I want to listen to that call.  I'm 25, 1/4 dead, old man river, years beyond my maturity, or whatever else you want to call it.  However, I prefer to look at it a bit simplier.  I now have a right to make people listen to me.  I'm a true adult, no more funny talk, I'm all business now.
