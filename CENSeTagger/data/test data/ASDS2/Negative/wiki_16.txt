Manduca ochus is a member of the Sphingidae family. It is found from Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua to Venezuela and Ecuador.

The wingspan is 119-120 mm. It can not be confused with any other Manduca species because of the forewing pattern of a tawny brown and the mottled charcoal costal area. The upperside of the head and thorax are tawny and orange and there are two pairs of submarginal black dots and a row of marginal black spots on the forewing upperside.

There are probably two or three generations per year with adults on wing in nearly all months in Costa Rica.

The larvae probably feed on Solanaceae species.
