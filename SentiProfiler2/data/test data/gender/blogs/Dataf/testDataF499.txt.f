Mr.Sunil Kumar promised us that he will deliver new brand Maruti Alto LXI to our residence (i.e., home delivery) with his driver Mr.Manjunath on 17-June-2007. We were asked to be present for the pooja of the vehicle at BIMAL Showroom, Indiranagar and assured us that the vehicle will be safely delivered to our residence through BIMAL driver Mr.Manjunath.

While parking the vehicle for fixing the Basic accessories, Mr.Manjunath, driver of BIMAL Auto Agency dashed another vehicle (which was just parked aside BIMAL showroom) and met with an accident, in which the vehicle which was supposed to be delivered to us got damaged.
