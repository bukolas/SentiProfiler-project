And here is all put together. I was happy. And loved the table settings and the flowers arrangements - green is not appreciated as a flower colour. Great wedding - the bride sang to the groom. Tired feet. Sleep now. Baking again soon. I decided to do a cutting cake for the happy couple. I had no idea how I was going to decorate the cake as the florist had told me that green cymbidiums are not in season until June. It was pure luck that these orchids were at the florist on my way home last night!!! (Side note - I have an exciting project in the works. Hopefuly it will come together!) The cutting cake it also carrot passion cake. Had to be. I wanted to make a carrot cake befitting for a passionate couple. This is soooooooooo good. I figured adding two p's - pomegranate and pistachio would up the passion in the carrot cake. I soaked the currants in orange juice. The carrot cake itself is really really (it is not your 'healthy' carrot cake). But totally fitting to have on a special occassion - like a wedding. I want to say it again. So good. I played around with my Love Chai tea. This was a mud cake. Not sure chai works as a mud cake. Filled with Dulce de leche. Yes I made the obligatory chocolate cupcakes. Flavour number two for the wedding - custard passionfruit cupcakes with white chocolate buttercream. Custard. Passionfruit. Nuff said. Ay yai yai. A couple of burnt finger tips and numerous cans of spray paint later the day my girlfriend's wedding finally happened. The theme was lime green and silver. I think I managed to coordinate everything well. The cupcake stand? Made (thanks dad!). The organza flowers? Made! Cupcake flavours? Decided! Five flavours. I don't care what anyone else says, baking in these 'cupcake' cups is hard. Not a big fan. I mean, yes they look good. But it is so much easier and I think the cupcakes cook and look so much better in the traditional paper liners. These are gluten free lemon cupcakes. Fantastic cupcake. Not so great photo or presentation. I made the peanut butter dulce de leche myself. So good. All the flavours complimented each other. Need to make this again. Next time I will get rid of the raspberry seeds so the ganache is smooth. Having said that, no one complained about having raspberry seeds in the ganache.
