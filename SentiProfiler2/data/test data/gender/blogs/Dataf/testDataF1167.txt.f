Well I'm having very little computer time because unfortunately my laptop is acting up and my hubby is still trying to diagnose the problem so we can get it fixed. I have to steal moments on his PC when I can so I may be sparse, we'll see. Now on to the point, Adrian's teacher called me today. She wants me to come meet her at the school tomorrow to talk about how we can help Adrian communicate better at home. I'm assuming she's talking PECS, which we know all about, but I'm hoping and looking forward to any new ideas she has. I NEVER turn down a chance to meet up with the teacher so I wasn't about to say that I didn't need advice! My conversation with Adrian today: Me: Did you have fun at school today? Adrian: (silence) Me: Did you have fun at school today? Did you play outside? Adrian: Outside! Me: Did you go down a slide today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Me: Oh you went on the swings today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Recess! Me: Oh you had recess today? Was that fun? Adrian: (Silence) Well it was some what of a conversation, I'm pleased!
