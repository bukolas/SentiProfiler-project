This photo was taken in downtown tampa of my buddy tyler and it was my first wireless flash attempt, and so far people on flickr have seem to like with 9 awards lol. This shot is of my buddy tiny, and its also in downtown or near the st pete times forum. its a rail thats fun to hop and do stuff over. i overlaid it with two differant shots but i like it even though his head is cut in the first picture.
