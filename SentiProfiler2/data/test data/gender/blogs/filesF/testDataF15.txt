Last week my girl's & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away. Lou was my parent's pet & the girl's begged to take him home every time we visited. Lou got very sick & had to be "put to sleep". Last week my girl's & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away.

When i got off the plan in aruba i knew it was a different place from the others we had been to in the carribean.  aruba has a constant breeze which makes the warm but not too warm weather even nicer!  the water was beautifully calm and gorgeously blue.  the food was good too!  my husband and i burn easily and yet left after a week in aruba with out a red mark on us!!
Wasn't sure whether we'd have a good experience after all the things I'd read in reviews about Enterprise, but we got to the small regional airport late in the day on a Thursday afternoon.  The compact we had reserved was gone and so we were upgraded to a Nissan Murano, a nice SUV (horrible gas mileage, though).The manager (only one person doing all the tasks) didn't write down a large scratch on the left rear bumper, and I made my husband go back in and have her identify it on her copy.
I have flown JetBlue many times and I have never had a bad experience.  I am a very frequent flyer, taking 100 or more domestic and international airlines trip a year, and I have flown most of the world's airlines, and I have to give JetBlue my personal award for being number one, the best. At least in coach.  I'm not saying that another airline's First Class or Business Class is not better (although I have flown afew where JetBlue's is superior to their premium service.  But in general I'm only comparing coach to coach, and the general day to day operations of the airline.
Kathmandu, has changed very little since my last visit except that things are slightly more expensive and there is even less electricity and more garbage. People seem to have given up on the idea that government will be solving their problems any time soon. As a result, there are more electric generators at shops and restaurants.
If you're in the market for a new point-and-shoot digital camera, you don't have to spend an arm and a leg for a product that produces quality photos. According to Wendy Sheehan Donnell, PCMag's managing editor for consumer electronics, if you're looking for a new digital camera, it's a great time to find a deal as vendors make room for newer models.Sheehan Donnell rounded up Eight Great Digital Cameras for Under $200. For example, you can save 40 percent off of the Canon PowerShot SD960 IS. Originally $329.99, the camera is on sale for $199.99 at BestBuy.com. The camera has a 16:9 LCD, which lets you frame your shots to match the format of HDTV and widescreen laptop displays. Read the full review at PCMag.com.
When I travel, I always try to find a Continental flight because I know that most of their flights are on-time and reliable.  I also find their seats to be a little roomier.  I recently flew American Airlines because it was more convenient, but was surprised at how CRAMPED the seats were!  In an airplane, when traveling with a lap child (child under 2 traveling on my lap for free), every inch of space counts -- big time!  We are very nearly always treated courtesly, although some of the flight attendants seem to be getting a little bit of an attitude, like "we're better and we know it".
Many people fear the holidays because they are afraid of putting on a few extra pounds. Some even turn down party and dinner invitations in hopes of avoiding any new bulges or rolls. However, holidays are the perfect time to touch base with family members and friends that you don’t see regularly throughout the year, so it is important not to let fears of gaining weight prevent you from having some holiday fun.
It is progress! If possible, I would like to visit the school when I go to Nepal in March and make a contribution to their operating expenses. I would also like to arrange a letter exchange with some of our local school students. But, I will have to wait and see how the plan unfolds. Travel restrictions, strikes, and weather can make it difficult to get to rural areas of Nepal, and someone would have to offer to host me in their home. With only a two week travel plan, I may not be able to get there and back. If I do get there, I'll bring you pictures and stories.

In February, I will be giving a free lecture on 'Life and work in Nepal during difficult times.' I will discuss the effects of 911 on Nepal, the murder of the entire Nepalese Royal family, endless annual strikes, and the Maoist Revolution. The lecture will be held at the Plymouth UCC in Shaker Heights, OH. Sunday February 14th, 9:30 - 10:20 am in room 102.
I want to run. To live. To live, every day. To see the world as full of beauty as it is. I don't want to surround myself with people who wonder why they exist. Who can't see the beauty; who don't see the purpose of it. I want to feel like dancing at my memories, dancing for my future, dancing in the moment. I want to giggle when I have no explanation for why.
The Mughals had a dress code and would not wear the pant/shirt cause mostly non-believers would wear them. However, now a days even our so-called Islamically established states have the concept of the western pant/shirt deeply engraved in their societies. So what now? What do our youth do? A solution can be to take these western concepts and "Islamisize" them. A good example would be clothing. Take the western pant/shirt and make them longer, and looser.

As Muslims we should look decent and healthily smart, not overly dressed to the extreme. And Muslims we should not lose our identity in the process.
evlon challenges its customers to “Get Cheeky” with their new Pinch Me Sheer Gel Blush. Being the makeup junkie that I am, I rose to the challenge and decided to give this new product a try. I did hesitate for a brief minute since I’d never heard anything positive about blush gels, but ultimately I decided to jump on in. I’m glad that I did!
The husband finished his breakfast and refused to take mom to the bank or walk Lucky when asked. Mum won't drive with me and would rather cancel her plans instead, which she did. As I was beginning to log out, What A Girl Wants was playing on TV and it was too tempting to let pass but I had to. I had things to get done. The husband went to sleep and refused to move, no matter how many times I called him. Annoyed and needing a break, I sat down to watch the movie.
It's our 20th episode and to help us celebrate, UGO's man about town, Parker Ward, dropped in to discuss the current holy TV trinity of Idol, Lost and the Olympics.  Are Simon and Ellen really mortal enemies or is their "feud" just another lame publicity stunt?  Does Survivor really suck?  Is Hoarders the best thing since Intervention?  And when will Claire quite yammering about her "bay-bay?"  All this and more answered to the best our ability on this week's cast!  Let us know your thoughts on these matter in our Facebook group and keep Toob Tied on constant rotation by subscribing to us on iTunes!
AND. My hair!? Something really weird is happening to my hair! I can't seem to find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't leave my hair grimy and gross. In the last couple of weeks every shampoo and conditioner I have used makes my hair feel like it has a terrible build up.
I love this show! Unfortunately, I didn't watch it when the it was on during it's regular season, because I didn't think it would be any good. I happened upon a rerun of it one day, and fell in love.It is one of the funniest shows on TV! My husband I TiVo every episode and watch them back to back! I cannot understand WHY it was canceled!? It is so entertaining and funny. I love Jason Bateman!!! And Portia De Rossi is so beautiful!
In a medium saucepan combine chicken broth, water, onion, brown rice, red pepper, and garlic.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat.  Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.  Stir in lentils.  Simmer, covered for 25 minutes more or until rice and lentils are tender.  Remove from heat.
2.     Add garbanzo beans to saucepan; use a potato masher to mash mixture.  Stir in oats.  Let stand for 5 minutes
3.     Meanwhile, combine egg whites, basil, Worchestshire, and salt; add to lentil-rice mixture in pan, stirring to combine.  Stir in nuts.
My last three flights booked on JetBlue were all cancelled. Without notice. Without warning. No phone call. No email. It has been extremely frustrating. While I know flight cancellations happen, I do expect to be notified so I don't get all the way to the airport before I find out!
I use all of hylands products! I love the arnica and any time someone is hurt I give it to them. I also love the fact that it is safer than name brand products you see in the store. About four years ago my daughter fell and hit a sprinkler so hard that it snapped in half. My parents were going to give her tylenol and I said NO!! The bruise was about four inches all the way around. I had my mom give her arnica tablets three times a day and then apply arnica cream to the bruise in the morning and then again at night.
Obesity is a rising problem in western societies. In the UK, according to NHS Statistics (published in Feb 2009) for the year 2007, 24% of adults (ie those over 16) were classified as obese, an increase of 15% from 1993, and 37% of adults had a raised waist circumference (over 88cm for women and 102cm for men) compared to 23% in 1993.
It is estimated that in America, at any given time, about two-thirds of the population (at a ratio of two women for every man) are on a diet (ref: Centre for Disease Control and Prevention), with only 5% successful at keeping off the weight lost.
I had LapBand surgery almost 2 years ago, and I have lost 80 pounds and kept it off with ease! It was the most amazing procedure and I love my band, and I have a totally new life now because of it! I have two young boys and I can run and keep up with them now.
ve done a lot of research when it comes to dog food. I am not a dog owner that buys my dog cheap food that has potential to cause a lot of allergies. California Natural is one of the best, top of the line dog food you can buy. My dogs have the softest coats. I am a Doberman owner and I do not cheap out on my 'babies'. That being said, a large bag is close to $45-50 in Michigan. Furthermore, I have to drive about 25 miles to get a bag because the local pet stores (Petsmart, Petco) do not sell this line.
My uncle for one will vouch for banning me from AlMaghrib, yes, this isn't the first time Sammo has decided she HAS HAS HAS to go to an AlMaghrib class and tell him that it would be advisable to come another weekend, that is if him and the family decide to pay us a visit (which they probably will). I love my family and relatives and they have and always will be priority, but AlMaghrib is my life now and sometimes its hard to decide between the two loves of my life.
Wow, the US is gorgeous.....and big!  I just got back from a five day trip to Yellowstone National Park and The Grand Tetons with my 13 year old nephew.  What a fantastic trip! It is like bringing your 7th grade science class with you on tour.I generally knew what a Geyser was, but, well not exactly.  And the difference between a Geyser and a Hot Spring or Boiling Mud Pot?  No, not at all.  With land spontaneously spitting out steam and mud bubbles, you can see why a 13 year old boy had a fabulous time.
My husband and I love watching "Arrested Development" on DVD.  We need to buy the series already!!  We have rented the entire 3 seasons from Netflix too many times to count.  What I really want to know is who made the decision to take this series off the air?  I mean seriously, are they still employed at Fox or what?  I would love to hear your comments if you know the answer or even want to rant.
his straightener is okay, when I first got it I was so excited, it worked great but I was noticing that after awhile it didn't work as good. It's been 5 months now and when I put it on a lower temperature it automatically turns off, and the plate covering is all chipped off. So basically I am going to have to buy another straightener due to I can't use this one anymore or it will chip even more. If you are planning on buying this product, I highly recommend you take extra good care of it or it will definitely break soon enough. I am going give the sedu a shot!
Although I should be doing 100 other things, I just want to write and say how happy I am and how blessed I feel. I think I have the greatest kids in the whole wide world. They are really great! They try so hard to be good. Thobe had an assignment the other day to fill out a star that said,, "I am special because..." and Thobe wrote, "I am special because I am good." I hung that next to my phone. Whenever I see it I think, "He is good. All my boys are just so good." I love them so much.
Cargo Plantlove eyeshadow ($20, Sephora) is proof that “green” beauty is not merely eco-chic. It’s eco-fabulous.Even if I didn’t know that this eyeshadow was organic, I really wouldn’t care. Plantlove eyeshadow is, for the most part, silky, deeply pigmented and highly blendable.My top pick out of the collection is Dove, a sexy and utterly wearable shade of neutral deep blue gray that performs beautifully as both an understated liner by day and a dramatic, lid-to-crease, smoked-out eyeshadow by night.
Eating 5 fruit and vegetables a day. Fortunately, the shops are helping us to achieve that goal. But don’t think just 5 fruit and no vegetables is enough; a new study by Rush University Medical center in Chicago has concluded that eating 2+ vegetable a day can help slow down mental decline due to ageing. Those people who ate 2.8 servings of vegetables almost halved their rate of memory decline compared to people who ate less than 1 serving a day. According to the study, it is not too late to start, as older people who started the 2+ veg a day still showed significant delay in mental decline.
"I often compare Backbreaker, weirdly, not to other football games, because we feel it's so different. The game that comes to mind for me is Burnout. Burnout's a driving game, but you don't need to be an expert driver to have fun with that. Because even if you fail in Burnout, you fail spectacularly and it looks cool and it feels good. Even when you've just smashed your car up, it looks really cool.
Last Saturday we went to a so called Gypsy Fair, which was more market for weird stuff then actual fair. But the “house trucks” were interesting to look at. If you imagine an old gypsy wagon then transpose it onto an older style truck you kind of can imagine what they were like. But overall it was rather disappointing, as much is becoming here.  Like Greg’s aspirations for work. For weeks he diligently prepped his resume, reviewed immigration information and made profiles on various job search websites. But often when he went back to those websites he couldn’t use his log in information and so emailed the websites for assistance.
his is the only food I have purchased for my bully since he was ten months old. It was highly recommended in my online bully groups; so thought I would try it. And I have never been disappointed for a minute! I have noticed how much easier it is for my dog to eat this than the puppy food he was on; as well as the fact that his flatulence is now virtually non-existant. I can't vouch for the flavor as my dog will eat anything; but I do believe in this product! I buy mine at Petco; and a bag at a cost of approximately $35 will last me about a month; and every tenth bag is free!
I've made my very first Mosaic picture, and it's all thanks to Mary over at Little Red House and the tutorial that she made! I do also want to thank Brenda over Cozy Little House for giving me that info! Thank you both so much! Seeing how much I loveeee pictures I know what I'm going to be doing alot of.
Please don't forget to stop in at Mary's blog Little Red House, she's the hostess of Mosaic Monday and there you'll be able to view every ones beautiful mosaic pictures, maybe even enter yourself!
So until the next time...Bead Happy!
Hugs and happy beading...
My charts are becoming real pieces of art these days.  My most recent work is the Gumball Chart, inspired by Chase's deep desire for a gumball machine in the house.  My kids don't chew gum at this point in their lives unless it's a special treat from Gramma, but I'm liking the idea of having one in the house for the sole purpose of rewarding super excellent behavior.  So, once all three of the gumball charts are filled, we'll head to the store to find a real life gumball machine of our own.
I have been flying for over 50 years domesticly and internationally. During that time, I have flown a lot of different airlines.Several years ago, I flew Jet Blue Airways with my daughter and grand-daughter and we absolutely loved it.Jet Blue Airways was clean and looked new.  There was actual enough leg room so you didn't feel like you were sitting in the other passenger's lap.Jet Blue provided me with many choices of delicious snacks.
What is my end goal? To change something, somehow. Or, at least, to understand better, mejor, and in a way that can contribute to some change being made. Because if nothing gets done... so what? I don't want to have just gotten paid to write a big extra-curricular research paper that will do nothing for anybody. I write, this summer, to help myself next spring. I write, next spring, to help us understand. I write, now, for the joy of it, because I am in love with the process. Because this is part of how I process, how I think, how I act.
I thought the snitching phase had died down, but apparently not. Because recently I've been hearing it all over again. And to be honest, I get sick to my stomach when I hear people say that! Why would someone want to save or protect a criminal who has harmed or killed someone!? Why should a murderer or someone who will harm again be allowed to? I mean someone help me out here! Lets say the victim was your best friend, mother or your child. Would'nt you want someone to come forward?
Some years ago before my mother had passed away she loved to bead and boy did she ever bead the most beautiful of pieces! I thought that today I would show you what she had made for me one St. Patrick's Day that I really treasure now.
Jaden and I usually have our date night on Fridays, so we just had one a few hours ago. As usually, it was a hit. Jaden got to pick the date night agenda and he picked books and two Pokemon movies. He asked if we could read three books together and he wanted me to watch two Pokemon movies with him. Well, he fell asleep halfway through the first movie. I ended up taking all 65lbs of him upstairs to his bed, but it was still such a success! He had the biggest smile on his face as he was giving me the 411 on Charizard and Pikachu.
Baby has officially graduated from embryo to fetus and has grown to about 1 inch in length. About the size of a medium green olive. His or her head is continuing to develop and take on more baby-like proportions. This week, tiny muscles are starting to form. This will allow her to move her arms and legs. It will still be awhile before I can feel it though!
This morning, i prayed the "Prayer of Faith" and i heard the Lord's gentle voice said , "Let it be so." and it was so . All day, i felt Jesus touching me and to me i had felt a big difference in me. I felt the Holy Spirit all over me and it was so amazing. I kept on thinking Jesus all morning and into the evening. The definition of faith is in Hebrews 11:1. What made thought of Jesus was this song "I could only imagine"

Remember all those "annoying" things that women do?
Yeah, it occurs to me, as a woman who does precisely none of those things, that guys actually like that.  But check it out, ladies: they're sneaky about it.  They give it different names.
i always thought that having a dream is stupid… because people always say, instead of keep dreaming, why can't you be practical?? stop dreaming and come back to reality! this is life!! well, what's life without a dream, eh? now i know it's OK to have a dream, no matter how unreachable or ridiculous it is :) even though i know some dreams are hard to reach, i'll still try my best to chase that dreams of mine. sure, maybe i might not be able to reach that dream. but hey, when i look back in my life, at least there won't be any regrets! because i'm a dream-chaser instead of a dream-crusher.
UGH! I cannot believe how late I am with this! We had such a busy week last week! We had something going everyday! Needless to say I didn't spend much time on the computer. (That might be a good thing!) Since we have already finished our first week of our 2 week menu I am just going to post this week's menu. I will do better next time! I promise!
When searching for a car seat, saftey was our number one priority. Comfort was our second. The Britax line of car seats delivers both.  Yes, they are more expensive than most of the car seats on the market, but once you experience them you will know why. They have the highest saftey rating in the industry, are built crazy strong, and are SO comfy for your little ones. They are easy to clean as all of the covers come off and can be washed as well.
After upgrading from my old manual toothbrush to a Sonicare Electric Toothbrush I would never even consider going back to using my old and outdated toothbrush again. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now and it does not feel like a chore to do. My teeth feel a completely new level of clean since the switch and I know it is working better when I go to floss and there is barely any food left behind after brushing between my teeth unlike before, although yes flossing is still necessary.
What have you been cooking and eating lately? It's been a while since I shared with you what I've been making so I thought it might be fun to share my latest adventure. First of all, I took a pasta making class a couple weeks ago at a place in Waco called Gourmet Gallery. It's a cute little kitchen store and they also hold lots of classes where they teach you how to make things such as pasta, tamales, bread, Mediterranean food, Easter desserts...I mean it's quite the range of classes. It's amazing. The only negative thing is that it costs money to take these classes. (Shocking, I know!) And often more money than I have.
Now that the Zune HD is on sale, and the and the latest Zune 4.0 software is live, we can definitively answer the big question: Has Microsoft finally caught up to Apple in the realm of portable digital music players?After a full, hands-on, lab-tested Zune HD review, we can safely say that the iPod touch is still the king of the hill when it comes to high-end touch-screen devices. Even so, the Zune HD is very impressive and goes a long way to redeem the Zune name. Besides the touch, it's easily the next-best MP3 player you can buy. If you want to live outside the iTunes ecosystem, it should be at the top of your list.
I have flown with Thai Air several times and each time it has been fabulous. I always choose to fly with them even if they are more expensive than other airlines. They have great food, and a lot of it....be prepared for a minimum of 5 to 6 meals on your trans-pacific flight. Stewardess's uniforms are always colorful and very beautiful.
so i've come to the dark side. well not really but i've bought my first dc comic. and anyone who knows me will tell you that i'm a marvel girl all the way. well i have gone and bought power girl. and i must say that i love it! it's really well written. the only thing i don't like is that they draw her with really big boobs. i mean really big boobs. but other then that, i really like the comic. it is on it's 10th issue this month and i would really suggest everyone to go out and read it. for once there's a good female comic. they give her attitude and don't make her this dumb blonde. she can defend herself and she has some spunk to her. she looks good but man she has some punch behind her. so i guess i'm kicked out of the marvel club house (i have borrowed that statement from the nerdy bird) but i'm ok with that. power girl is a good read.

In honor of Fringe's April 1st return, it appears Walter Bishop is celebrating the Day of Fools by donning a ridiculous wig.  Or maybe it's just that Walter's 'do is from 1985.  Yes, we will be having some bad 80's hair flashbacks in the upcoming mythology heavy episode "Peter," as Walter devles into his son's "otherworldly origins" with Olivia.  We'll also finally meet Peter's mother (played by Irish actress Orla Brady).   For those Fringe fans jonesing for a mythos fix, the Spring return sounds like a first class ticket on a Walter Bishop acid trip.   Read on for more head-spinning spoilers.
In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stir in the turkey and flour. Add the milk, and heat through. Stir the turkey mixture into the vegetable mixture, and cook until thickened. Cool slightly, then pour mixture into the unbaked pie shell. Roll out the top crust, and place on top of filling. Flute edges, and make 4 slits in the top crust to let out steam.
Over the past few years it seems like cosmetic companies come out with some new life-altering mascara every other week. I'm never the girl who's quick to run out and buy a new tube of mascara because I've found that plenty of them don't work at all or that they just don't give me the look I'm going for. Even though I was blessed with a head full of thick hair, my eye lashes, it seems weren't so lucky. They are thin and they're barely noticeable without mascara. They also have a natural curl which is good because I don't have to use an eye lash curler, but it's also bad since the curl causes my eye lashes to look short and stumpy.The Maybelline Define A Lash mascara has been on the market for a year or so and it's gotten great reviews in magazines and Adriana Lima endorses it.
I am swooning over this dresses on the newly discovered Eve Gravel shop. The shop is Canadian based and sells the most wonderful items. The dresses are all I ever wanted for spring (and all year long). And the model photos are gorgeous! Oh pretty dresses, how I pine for you!
Ever wonder how celebrities get such beautiful, glowing healthy skin? if                                     they're not lucky enough to be born with it, like this Hollywood mother-daughter duo,                  they must have some tricks up their sleeves … right? Yup.
And though we don't claim to be geniuses or anything, from what we've seen on the red carpet    (and learned from the many skin care experts, celebrity makeup artists and top dermatologists we've chatted with), we know that healthy-looking skin starts before you ever pick up your foundation brush. Before you ever try to cover up those dark circles and red or brown spots (aka sun damage and acne). You must first nip imperfect skin in the bud                                          by first addressing something else: your uneven skin tone.
Maybe it's because we've had a few warm days after an extremely hard winter, but I just feel so blessed and so happy. I know that God lives and that he loves me and my family. I'm so grateful that he blessed me with Michael and my boys and also incredible parents, siblings, in-laws and friends. I love this beautiful Earth and am so grateful that I know where all these blessings originate. I truly am grateful for all God does for me.
....I'm going on a rant for a few minutes....here's my issue.... I understand that there are a lot of dead beats out there who don't pay child support after their divorce. But when someone is actually trying.........and not just saying that they are.......then should they really get a lot of crap of not BEING ABLE to pay it?  They may be making a truck payment......just barely by the hair of their chinny chin chin.......but if they don't make the truck payment they can't work, and if they can't work there's no possible way of them ever getting caught up on child support. It's not like they're taking the meager amount of money they are getting an blowing it on anything meaningless. They're actually trying to pay bills and do the right thing. Besides being 400 behind isn't nearly as bad as being 1300 or more behind....like other people. The way I see it.....yes, child support is supposed to be paid...of course no one is arguing that....and there is no excuse for those who aren't even putting out the slightest bit of effort...but if someone is having a hard time...like the loss of a job and not getting anything in between but a few crap opportunities that wind up going nowhere....then shouldn't they be cut just A LITTLE SLACK? It's not like they lost their job because they stayed out all night drinking and couldn't wake up for work.....or decided to go to a bar instead of earning money.....maybe the company they worked for shit on them and they've had a hard time finding anything since. I think people should stop being so vindictive and appreciate the fact that their child actually has someone who is really trying to help support them and is busting their ass to try and make sure they will be able to catch up as soon as possible.  And if people are going to throw "I need to buy groceries for your kid," or "I can't pay bills because you don't pay me," please be sure and leave out the part about trying to make it a point to go the movies, or out to eat, or any other outing at least once a week. If you're blowing your money doing those things, you can't be hurting that bad. You most certainly shouldn't threaten the other parent with loss of visitation to their child! Yes the judge may have given you custody......but they're still the parent as well. You're not only hurting them but you will tear your child apart by using them as a weapon against the other parent!! The ONLY reason that sort of threat should come about is if the child is not being taken care of or is in some sort of dangerous situation while under the supervision of the other parent......and never at any other time. I really hate hearing people do these things to other people. And for no other reason besides the fact they think it's a way to keep them under their thumb. Some people think they have to have control of everything..........they need to grow up and realize that nobody ever has full control of anything.  Once they do that, they may be capable of being half way decent people.
ok so maybe my once a week isn't turning out the way i had hoped....but it's not like i haven't thought about blogging! i have. in fact! i kept a pink post it note going on what i needed to blog about. it's full. so this will probably be pretty long.

first on the list: i don't have enough guy friends. i don't necessarily have a LOT of friends. (real friends anyway). but i definitely think i need more male friends. less drama. more laughs. and they generally don't get upset when you haven't hung out "in forever".

second: i got netflix!! i loooooove it!! seeing a bunch of movies i've wanted to see but haven't. and it's cheaper. plus i can watch stuff online (too bad i don't have internet....). which brings me to point 3. dexter. best tv show ever!!! omg. it's disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. brilliant. i'm obsessed. finished season 1 and am on episode 6 of season 2. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful dramas. but if you don't like the F word...maybe steer clear. it's shown on showtime and not cable so....but it's great!!

fourth: have you ever felt like telling someone to suck it??? cause i have. a lot lately. i truly want to look at someone i can't stand and forcefully say "suck it." maybe throw in a bitch at the end too if i'm feeling really vengeful. i'm sick of the hypocrisy and dumb assed-ness. (<-totally made up that awesome word just now). but in all seriousness....i want a lot of people to pull their heads out their asses.

fifth: i live next door to Danville. it's a place for old people. it helps them find affordable housing and care and what not. but i think a lot of old/homeless people live in the building as well. anyway....either someone is about to croak, or they did b/c for the past week the fire dept has been there every night. i stand on the balcony and watch them. which brings me to point 6. wouldn't it be great if a firefighter looked up and saw someone watching them and decided to introduce them self and they fell in love and what not??? not saying me of course. it was just a crazy thought i had. then my next thought was, what a great novel! someone should get on writing that. stat.
My heart broke once I made a decision. I knew I could second guess my decision forever, so I promised myself not to dwell on it. We bought Pikachu and brought her home. Just like with the stuffed dogs, I wish I could have brought all the guinea pigs home and spoiled them like I am and will do to Pikachu.

It's only been two days since we brought her home, and I already can't imagine what it would have been like if I'd chosen the other guinea pig.

Guinea pigs are more like cats than dogs, in the sense that you have to earn their love. They're also prey animals so they're skittish and wary of humans. But Pikachu is adjusting to her new life. She wouldn't eat the first day when we were in the room, but overnight she ate a little. Now she's drinking water and eating lettuce and squeaking happily when we pet her behind her ears.

When I was researching guinea pigs online, everyone who owned them and talked about them on forums and websites were really.. I don't know how to put it, but attached I guess? You can tell they think of them like family. Just like people think of dogs like family, but maybe a little more obsessed. Some people give their guinea pigs entire rooms instead of cages. But now I can see where they're coming from because I do love Pikachu like she's family already. I doubt I'd ever have a room for guinea pigs, but I'm totally creepy guinea pig lady over Pikachu ;)

I'm going to get a guinea pig.
One night, I randomly looked into getting some dwarf hamsters because I remember going to Pet Co. last year and thinking they were cute. I just want a small pet because I can't have a dog and I miss having a pet. The more research I did about dwarf hamsters, though, the less appealing they became. They're appartently not very tame and have only been domesticated for about a decade. They also are cannibalistic toward their young. However, I never wanted or looked into a guinea pig because I thought they were too big but I had heard great things about them.

Then I went to visit Mike's sister Nicki and she has one named Yoshime. I'd never really paid much attention to her before, but I really fell in love with her. Nicki let her out and let her run around and she was adorable. So then I started researching and Mike even said he'd be interested in getting one now.

I got really excited like a little kid and I got my hopes up. Then we started talking about how our apartment building wouldn't allow pets. We thought about hiding it from them, but the landlords and maintenance burst into our apartments all the time unannounced so it would basically be impossible. I lost all hope, but decided to call anyway and check, even though our lease says "NO PETS AT ALL. ANY PETS FOUND WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE FINE OF $1,500 AND THE PET MUST BE REMOVED."

I called our apartment the next day, completely prepared. I had my confident voice and I had all my rebuttals ready. Once they said no, I was going to tell them that I could certainly understand, but that I was willing to pay a pet deposit and that I would let them check up on the guinea pig at any time. However, I never had to use any of those rebuttals. The lady answered the phone and I asked if guinea pigs were allowed. She asked, "Will it be in a cage?" and I said, "Of course." And then she said it would be allowed.

So then I decided that I'm definitely going to get a guinea pig. I'm going to wait until we move into our new apartment on the 21st. Hopefully this isn't just a phase for me and a guinea pig will be a wonderful and friendly addition to the new apartment.
Today has gone well. I decided I can't just cold turkey quit smoking, so I've cut down a lot. I use to smoke a pack a day, but today I only smoked 3. So I'm hoping cutting down slowly will help me quit. I've had the taste of alcohol in the back of my throat all day but I've been fighting the urge to drink. It also helps that I moved into my mom and her boyfriend's house yesterday. They don't keep alcohol in the house. So that is helping a lot with the situation. I also moved to a new town which will be very helpful with my change. It will allow me to concentrate on it alot more. Also I can make new friends that support my decisions. Apparently there is a really good church here with a good youth group so I'll have to check that out soon. I'm hopefully going to be finding a job soon and getting my own car. This will help a lot with finding new friends.
The 4 Stages of Converse Shoes

I've been through a lot with my onverse shoes. I've warn them throught my liffe so i know what it is like and I know the features of when you get new ones. I recently got new ones and i just want to tell you the 4 stages from when you first buy the shoes and when you just cant where them anymore. HAHA

1. This is the first stage of your new converse shoes. When you first try them one they are like totally cool and new but they havent really FIT in with the size of your feet. They can feel hard and very new.
2. The second stage is when the converse FIT in with your feet. BUT they just start to squeak. I was walking bye in the hallways of my school one day and it startd to squeak, and i noticed that all my converse shoes have done that. I didnt like it. Its kinda embarrassing.
3. This is probab;y my favorite stage. The squeak just gos away and it fits within my foot.
4.The last stage. I'ts wearing out and the the word ALL STAR has just disappeared. Time to get new ones.

Those were all the stages. But theres one thing about converse shoes that I hate. EVERY time i put them on i have to stick my finger in the shoe to get my foot in and my finger is like rubbing against the shoes and it hurts like really bad. Well not that bad.
hehe thanks 4 reading this.
So today, was long. I woke up early and finished an essay went to class not too lively of a day.

But as I was walking home I heard a strange noise and as I walked closer to this man I noticed he was playing bagpipes. It was pretty interesting, I can say I have ever really seen someone play bagpipes in person before.

Now back to homework.So I have started classes again and to my amazement the three of my five classes all require course work to be done and turned in online. I am ok with this but the think that really irritates me is that each class uses a different website. One has Motif one Turnitin one D2L whatever that is. (desire to learn). AND it doesn't stop there I need an Iclicker. What the F*%k is an Iclicker. Incase you were wondering like I was an Iclicker is a device used to participate in class. What happen to the good old-fashioned hand-raising, or class discussion. Well thats it for now.

I have to go register on my class websites.
Everyone forgets that Icarus also flew.
It's the same when love comes to an end,
or the marriage fails and people say 
they knew it was a mistake, that everybody 
said it would never work. That she was
old enough to know better. But anything 
worth doing is worth doing badly.

Like being there by that summer ocean
on the other side of the island while 
love was fading out of her, the stars 
burning so extravagantly those nights that 
anyone could tell you they would never last. 
Every morning she was asleep in my bed
like a visitation, the gentleness in her 
like antelope standing in the dawn mist. 
Each afternoon I watched her coming back 
through the hot stony field after swimming, 
the sea light behind her and the huge sky 
on the other side of that. Listened to her 
while we ate lunch. How can they say 
the marriage failed? Like the people who 
came back from Provence (when it was Provence) 
and said it was pretty but the food was greasy. 
I believe Icarus was not failing as he fell, 
but just coming to the end of his triumph.
And when I speak German, I have to express myself in exactly the same way. I can't convey the dark subtleties of  my inner-being to the person in front of me. I ask. I get. Simple as. So naturally, my personality and view of the world, how others percieve me and how I percieve myself, changes automatically.

When I visit a restaurant and my meal isn't quite right, I have to tell the staff, as clear as day, what's wrong with it. Straight off. If I were in England, given the nature of our language, I would be ridiculously apologetic for any inconvenience I may have caused them. If I said roughly the same thing in German, the waiter would look at me quizzically and ask what I'd done to it. In English I "remember"; in German I "remind myself".

In English, I am the height of politeness. In German, I am constantly apologising for things I haven't done - and therefore just a bit weird. And in French? I am a German - over-rolling my "r"s and sticking verbs at the end of sentences. The languages I speak: as much as I may try to contort the words into something understandable to a native, you can guarantee that the words are contorting me twice as much.

Foreign languages - the best and quickest way to contract multiple personality disorder, what say you?
It has been more than one year from when I wrote my last blog. I require a lot of motivation to do this and of course a good reason as well. Today I've got both to do this again. It's my 23th birthday, which is so specially to be cherished for the rest of my life.

I had it in Gottingen. Although far away from family, I've got all the friends celebrated with me at the same time. Messages from friends all over the world--- Swiss, America, Belgium, and France and for certain Home. What's so surprising is the email from Michiru who is a friend of mine in Japan. Despite the fact that she's been very busy with becoming a mother, she still remembers to send her best wishes just in time!!
....Nothing much to write about today. Nothing has pissed me off, nothing making me feel like turning cartwheels. Although, if I turned a cartwheel right now, it would probably end up in a trip to the emergency room and that would piss me off. I just felt like typing so random stuff floating around in my head is ending up here. 
Is that how you spell babbling? for some reason it doesn't look correct, but spell check says it is right. hmmm? Oh well.

Why is it the games Dare likes the most are the ones with the most annoying sounds? Why is he soooo good at them?  I kinda miss the simple games I used to play. Especially the one where you shoot at the gopher stealing carrots out of your garden. If you hit him he would say "ugh, I'm hit. Going down." If you only came close he would jump up and down saying "what was that for you idiot?" and then flip you off. I missed on purpose often. Drove my mom insane.
For example, there was a friend who was committed to some guy. And then we happened to ask this girl whether she was sure that this was the guy she wished to be with even after say, 10 years. The answer was 'no'. Then, why? The question is WHY? Why do people stick with people, get into a relation, have fun, and then break up? I don't say that all people are the same, and many of them are faithful, but there are many who are not. And even if we recognize the true colours of people, why do we keep passing on time in futile? Time pass? Is that the motive of all this? Love is so fuckin' blind? Are we stupid? Yes. Amen.

There was another guy who claims that he had a break up with his girl because that girl hated his doggy and hence, she dumped him. Now. Where is co-operation? Adjustment? What is love? 0_o

People might ask me to ease down a bit, and take things a bit lightly. They might tell me that I am too serious about life. But hell, atleast I think a couple of times before wasting my time on something or someone. Why holler around with something or someone with no purpose what-so-ever?

Another example: friend showing all the smses of a drunk lover: "ohh maan...your hazel eyes...and your lips...blu blu..bli bli bli...bla bla..." She laughed at him. And I laughed back loud like an immature oaf. And it seems to be a claimed fact that at the peak of teenage, you are supposed to take the opposite sex a bit lightly. Every Romeo, every cribbing lover happens to be a bastard within with verses of Satan running through his blood. Ahan. We girls(I mean, my species of girls) don't like it when a guy just uses the ladies and we love the 'one man for a life time'-and-the-blah-blah philosophy. But there are girls who can bet on their life to claim that we have to be treated the way we are being treated right now. A girl herself told a guy, that this is the age where we are supposed to know how the opposite sex is, and just hang out with her, and do 'time pass', and not to get too serious about her(say, expert guidance in misguiding the people trudging on right paths). Alright, everyone seems to be stuffed up with the same shit. Not cool. This seems so correct to most of the people, surprisingly. But for me, it seems so utter rubbish. Seems like some unwritten law. Not cool. It's crappy and unnerving.
I don't wanna get hung up on details, or this thing could get long and complicated, so I'll start with some highlights.  

Christmas morning was lovely and peaceful.  The Boy is sweet and gracious, and he was so good all day that I'm still not sure it wasn't a coma dream.  Or that Ward drugged him...  

I know for sure though, that drugged is the way to celebrate, as a started getting hit with a cold on Wednesday night, and dosed myself with Dayquil all day yesterday.  It slowed my mind just enough that it was like I was watching a home movie.  It was marvelous, really.
Sometimes I feel like Willie Lohman, only I'm much happier. I've been on the road since the end of February. I flew to BWI (Baltimore International Airport), spent a night or two with friends in DC, and then began my journey down to South Florida. After an 8 hour drive I spent the night in St. George, SC. After a morning of not taking advantage of the free processed food , but loving the free treadmill, I ventured on down to Daytona, where Bike Week was in full swing. Friends had rented a gorgeous house in an old neighborhood, with huge oaks and pines and imaginary bobcats.

The minute I entered Florida on Hwy 95 I was engulfed in nostalgia. I remembered walking hand in hand with Paul on the Mayport beach at the intersection of canal and Atlantic. We later took the same walk when I was pregnant and we conversed about how excited I was to be introducing a soul to our wayfarer lifestyle with all it's beauty and spontaneity.

In Daytona, my girlfriend & I visited the legendary Iron Horse Saloon, it is what I refer to as "Thunder Dome". Again, I was taken back to another year, another time, Pre- Adrian. It was the year 1999 when I first entered this bar with it's multi level swing bridges and burn out pits and I knew for sure that Tina Turner would come swinging down any minute.

My next stop took me to one of the equestrian capitols of the world. It was great seeing old friends and catching up.

My greatest fun, was visiting Nicky. I trained Nicky to take over my job as a shore excursion tour director for the cruise ships in St. Thomas in 1999. She was then my boss as the Atlantis Submarine, a real submarine that took 54 people down 90 feet to a fed coral reef. Nicky now works as a director for a privately owned cruise ship for the elite billionaires of the world. We had a blast. She's from Whales and we are comfortable enjoying a good cuppa.

I'm staying in Florida longer than expected. Weather and expectations may be better.

Traveling for hours at a time with no dial on the radio worthwhile, with lots to ponder and a journal for contemplating. When the day is done it is satisfying and rewarding. Good friends, good memories, lots of self exploration.
What else? Hmmmmm....oh, I had an interesting string of conversations with Alyssa recently. Apparently my aunt snapped a couple weeks ago and sent Aly the longest email ever as an attempt to make amends with her. They haven't gotten along for years and years. Alyssa was so upset by the email that she sent it to me for some advice. It was such a slap in the face. I talked on the phone with her for over an hour, two different days. Actually, both days I ended up sitting out in my car in the driveway. That is my weird solution to preventing myself from pacing when I'm on the phone for a long time. Eventually our conversation got away from the bullshit with her mom and we caught up about everything else. Alyssa is yet another person that I can talk to about anything. I guess I'm really lucky in that way. Why is it that so many great conversations take place while in the car? Maybe it's just me, but I've had some friendship-changing conversations on a late-night drive on a long road.
I have a really fun week ahead of me. I'm seeing my very first Broadway show, and I'm taking a roadtrip to a place I've never been before.
Hopefully some of the things that I've ordered as Christmas and Birthday (and baby shower) gifts will start showing up in the mail. I want a better idea of the dent I've made in my holiday shopping.
Ok, soooooo, yeah. I guess that's all for now.
Even when I first started, the lunches were much better than your average school lunch. The kitchen exclusively served organic milk and yogurt, and the salad bar always had lettuce, tomatoes, and other fresh vegetables.

Even with a few great items in the cafeteria, it still has a long way to go. The majority of students and staff eat food from the main meal line, and the food is just a small step up from an average school lunch. Hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets, and pizza are monthly mainstays. Yes, the hot dogs might be lower sodium and the buns are made with whole wheat, but healthy and nutritious, they are not.

Before taking this job, I worked in a few upscale restaurant kitchens as a cook, pastry chef, and sous chef. I rarely cooked at home, and I ate pretty poorly during those years. It made me wonder why I was cooking in the first place.

I would never have guessed I would end up working in a school cafeteria five years ago. New York City was just beginning to revamp its school lunch program when I was finishing up culinary school. They were hiring at my culinary school’s career fair. I was interested, but I didn’t linger at their booth too long. Why would I spend two years of my life learning to cook and then work for a school, where little cooking is done on premises?

Several years later and exhausted from twelve hour days feeding a select few restaurant-goers, I began to think about school food. I heard more and more about people like Alice Waters and Ann Cooper. I taught a free cooking class for high school students and their stories reminded me how bad school lunch can be. At some point, tackling a stagnant school food system seemed much more interesting than making truffle risotto day in and day out.
This morning I gave someone a gift which spread a smile across their face. That was the best feeling ever, to know that making a small amount of effort would improve their day dramatically! 

I am of course talking about Mother's Day. Today I gave my Mum a 2ft card and a small teddy bear (which she's now called Aristotle..!), and the smile that came on her face was brilliant :) I'm really glad she likes it, and today things seem to be a lot more on the up for her, which is a relief considering last week. 

As for myself, well today is another day of normality. I'm dying for a week Saturday to come, when unbelievably huge deadlines are out of the way. Every night of this week is going to be dedicated to making some form of draft of my dissertation. I know fully well it won't be anywhere near the standard my final draft will be, but heck, why not make the effort and get some useful feedback. I got a 2.2 for the dissertation report that I did, which was 20% of my overall dissertation grade. Granted, it was a low 2.2, but heck, it could've been a 3rd! So that's given me a bit of a boost. I know fully well my stress levels will go through the roof this week because of my work, but i'll manage hopefully :) And the weekend will bring some much needed relaxation and giggles!
Recently, spm resultt released. Those people around me, have a great result. This make me stress. I stress, not because i scared and hate the feeling of lose. I stress as i don't want to disappoint my parents. They have been putting a lots of hope on me, since i get i a great result at kinder garden. It also mean, my childhood is in stress. Though, i appreciate what they have done. Thanks mum, dad. Although stress, I suppose i will go through it by myself. I will try my best to not disappoint u all. Bro, thanks for your support. You are the best brother in the world. SPM,Me, Rainie, never scare of YOU. As what Asson say, angel is always by my side.
I've been running this off and on cold for three days now. It started with IMMENSE fatigue and soreness, so I thought it was the flu, but then it never digressed into upper-respiratory torture? Then on Saturday it was nonexistent, then today I feel sick again (but still no nose slobber). Maybe it's some order of slow burning swine flu that in a week or two will finally come around to making me do my sickness hibernation techniques.

So I have my very own apartment now and all of you should be fucking proud of me, because other than that one time in Asheville (some of you may affectionately remember the hemp-hill home) I have never done this all on my own before. And I do mean all on my own, down-posits, rent, contracts. Talking to them. You know, stuff adults do.

I'm going to paint the walls purple and put those glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. Christmas lights will be a-plenty. I already have some dank smelling candles from IKEA that stank up the apartment like crisp cinnamon apple (and now it smells like a thousand cinnamon orgasms).

I live in NW balls deep in the city and I wouldn't have it any other way.
I am honored that my painting “The Divine Mother” (4' x 8', acrylics) has caused such controversy. The theme of the 2007 Artery Exhibit in Eureka Springs, AR was Icons, and I chose to paint what I believe to be one of the most beautiful and inspirational iconographic themes that transcends the world of art to include the history of mankind— the simple and beautiful image of a woman breastfeeding her child. The judges at the Portfolios.com Creative Awards, an international competition, also found this to be beautiful and gave me an award for this painting (Illustration '08).
Since ancient times, people have been so inspired by the beauty of this image that incredible myths and religious stories and artwork have been created, even worshipped. This includes depictions of the Egyptian Goddess Isis breastfeeding baby Horus, an ancient myth which bears striking similarity to and which many scholars say inspired the Madonna del Latte or Maria Lactans imagery of Europe, which reached the height of its popularity in the middle ages.
I title my painting “The Divine Mother,” though it is not a depiction of the Virgin Mary, as many people erroneously believe. The Virgin Mary is just one divine mother icon of many; my divine mother is one of unity, love, gentleness, compassion—and so she combines world traditions and religions, transcending time and space, melding pre-Christian religions with Christianity to be an icon we can all identify with and find peace and beauty with. Look closely at her face—it is half-blue (many Egyptian statues of Isis are blue) , and she is wearing Egyptian makeup.
As many people have noticed, I put a new twist on this subject by adding the text “Does this halo make my face look fat?” to the painting. The Madonna Lactans and Isis imagery began as a way to show the compassion of the divine mother and therefore to make her more real, human, and accessible to us. Adding the text was my attempt to refresh and modernize this theme—to make her accessible, relevant, and real to a modern audience. The divine mother, in all her forms, is undeniably the greatest supermodel of the art world since the beginning of mankind—so I believe that like you, she worries about how she looks in a painting, photograph, or sculpture!
A question for God looms in my mind like water rolling and spinning; chortling into an abyss of time. When I was nineteen I was dying so that I could live. I survived this challenge to come through this lifetime with the knowledge that God is within.


I was a college student, home for the summer and had gone to a party. At that party there was drinking and pot smoking. A good friend’s boy friend had come on to me and I was tempted to flirt back. In fact, I did flirt back. I was young. I was beautiful and I was an atheist. 


A year earlier my longest childhood friend had a swimming pool accident which left her a paraplegic. My friend, the athlete was changed forever and I felt guilty. It was the unreasonable kind of guilt that summons over the young just because it can and it did. My friend was changed and I too changed. I grew angry, and in a way I became uncaring about life itself.


I learned years later that often when we have profound thoughts they can manifest into reality. My thoughts at that time were, “Why didn’t it happen to me?”


That night of drunken partying with a cute boy who was supposedly attached to a good friend I got into my car to drive home and through no fault of my own was hit. Suddenly my car flew out of control spinning around and around in the darkened summer night. I sat in the driver’s seat with voices going through my mind of my father and my brother, “Don’t do this....Do that!” Paralyzed I began to pray, “Dear God! I don’t know what to do! Help me!” In that moment I gave up my arrogance and went into complete surrender and when I did that an extreme and blinding white shield of light came directly out of my chest surrounding me like an egg shell.


The car continued to spin and finally slammed into an apartment building narrowly missing a telephone pole. I jumped out of the car mainly to see if I could still walk. My car was totaled, but I was okay. 


The man who had hit me had been “joy racing” with another driver going over 90 miles per hour and I had inadvertently gotten into his way.
Being that my school is on a year round schedule, there is always one "track" of kids not at the school for a few weeks at a time. Though I like the sporadic breaks here and there, a small void is always felt for those fellow teachers you work with that are gone for a few weeks. So a few times this school year, a group of my work friends have met up at the Cheesecake Factory for random visits with friends that we have been missing at work. Last week, a Cheesecake Factory trip was planned for this week to play catch up with some of our dear track 4 (off track) teachers. . . or so I thought. . . 
I should have been a little suspicious when one teacher wished me a happy birthday today at work. . .." uhhh thanks. . . but a few weeks late! Where are you getting this information?" Well. . . my brain got a thinking, and sure enough. . . I found myself at Cheesecake Factory dinner not in honor of missing our friends (though I think that is still a big part of it), but rather for a Happy Birthday Shawna dinner!
The food was good, the dessert was even better, but the company was by far the best! These ladies have truly become some of my favorite people that I can go to for a laugh or a cry during a time in my life where I have no super close friends in proximity. Today was by far a rather crappy day at work, but who can understand what Im going through better than this group of people? They really know how to make a person feel much better about themselves. Who would've guessed that a two week late birthday dinner could be such perfect timing?? 
By the end of the night I even got one of them to agree to become a garbage man with me as long as I drive and let her ride the back! Awww. . . now that's 
what friends are for!
Having mono during school has been really difficult for me. I am constantly tired. Not only is it hard for me to wake up in the morning, it's hard for me to find the motivation to go to class, study and get work done. The doctor said the fatigue could go away in 2 weeks and it could last for 3 months. It's been almost 3 weeks and I feel just as tired as before.

I can already tell that this is not going to be a dean's list semester. I'm disappointed with myself, but I feel so helpless. I can't even ask my teachers for a break because UHS won't give me permission to miss any classes.

Not only is my academic life suffering, but so is my social life and my emotional well-being. I don't have the energy to straighten my hair any more and my self-esteem takes a hit every time I look in the mirror. I think the huge bags underneath my eyes are permanent. The apartment is a mess too, which I can't live with. Cluttered house, cluttered mind. You're supposed to lose weight with mono, but all I can do is sit on the couch and I'm not allowed to exercise, so I fear I'm gaining weight.

I need to turn this around. This is a challenge. If I got dean's list this semester, I would be incredibly proud of myself. I know I shouldn't be straining myself, but I need to push myself because right now, I'm not really pushing myself at all.
As I've been gleefully exclaiming to all and sundry on my Youtube channel, yesterday I went for some Afternoon Tea (the very phrase conjures pomposity unlimited and therefore regally requires capital letters) at a very posh hotel in London with an intimidating dress code and a price list even more so. So finally, after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and wandering about the flat in semi-constructed and poorly-considered outfit choices, we finally managed to mobilise our troops and begin our expedition to somewhere a little different.

I held Kiwi's hand as we nervously shuffled past the doormen of the Connaught Hotel and crossed the threshold, half expecting to be rebuffed by a cross-looking moustache in a top hat and tails, or for the unsmiling host blocking our entry to our desired destination to tell us that we were unsuitably attired, or our reservation could not be located.

Feeling none of the bravado of Red Riding Hood, I felt a little lost in the woods as we were ushered to a seat and sat down before my seat was pushed in. Luckily there was no slapstick tumble to the floor, rather an awkward pause as I calculated the distance between myself and the table, and the danger of dropping one of those so-carefully prepared pastries into that unavoidable gap. I stood up awkwardly and let the nice lady with the grey suit push my chair in a little further.
There's so much to say.
Every little nuance of life becomes exaggerated when you're in the hospital.
Every interaction becomes multiplied in meaning.
Every small exchange between me and the saviors-in-scrubs became a desperate reliance on their expertise and kindness.

I feel like the hospital is the gateway from death into brith and life into death.
I was  born in one and I've been near death in many.
My hospital visits for my various illnesses and surgeries are like the punctuations in my rambling life.

Yesterday's surgery went well and by well I mean my knee should be improving and I didn't die.

My surgeon explained the "mess" my knee was in. There was the "fracture" in the cartilage, fairly new (happened 11 months ago) that needed to be cleaned up. Then there was the bone-on-bone arthritis that had to be dealt with. Meniscus shavings were all over the place causing pain and inflammation. He cleaned up what best he could. We'll be doing protein injections in about a month to ease the arthritis.
I'm optimistic.

The pain is pretty bad but I have plenty of pain killers.
I was urged to take them and to get rest.
No need to be the tough-guy by not taking the meds.
See, pain is a signal to the body that something is wrong. Pain puts the body in crisis mode.
Fight or flight crisis responses do not facilitate healing.
Taking the pain killers and resting tells the body that it's time to heal.
Now if only I would stop fussing around the house and get some rest!!
The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. I realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue-eyed gentleman was his salvation.
I held my tears as I stood there with them.
 The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted.
He said, 'Coffee is all Miss' because that was all they could afford. (If they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. He just wanted to be warm).
Then I really felt it - the compulsion was so great I almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes. 
That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action.
I smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray.
I then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. I put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman's cold hand.
He looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, 'Thank you.'
I leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, 'I did not do this for you. God is here working through me to give you hope.
I started to cry as I walked away to join my husband and son. When I sat down my husband smiled at me and said, 'That is why God gave you to me, Honey, to give me hope..'
We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that only because of the Grace that we had been given were we able to give. 
In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's, my son,the instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night I spent as a college student.
Well I was just sitting here wondering what the next step is. Anybody that knows me will tell you that I'm a person who likes things planned out. But at this time in my life I am not the one in charge of making the plans. I have met a wonderful guy who treats me like gold. But when will he ask me to be his wife? I have gotten my diabetes under control. But when will God make me a mother? I have worked so hard on getting to this point in my life I just wonder what's the next step?
I want this on my body, I want a tattoo, I want a lot of tattoos. First of them has to be a simple heart on my right foot to carry on a simple tradition. Ya see my best friend from the age of about three is going to carry on the tradition of the "foot heart tattoo" or whatever it is and I have agreed to embark on this with her. So I cant start my ink filled journey without her.. the journey should start soon... Hopefully.

So with no direction and the never ending search for a career path growing more and more difficult I have decided to vent.. to blog. A bit about myself I am a student, studying who knows what at this moment. Transcript says in store for my next semester is French, Sign Language, English 300 and 302 Magic, Witchcraft and Religion, and fitness. We'll see how that goes. I have a strong passion for languages, and culture. I would love to be a reporter, or a medic, a translator, a psychiatrist, I'd love to do it all. First I have to settle on a major, at the moment I am thinking a double major in Communications and International Relations. Or Linguistics. This is going to be harder than I thought..

Well I that's it for now I have to call it a day I have a job interview tomorrow. Wish me luck.
Last night I was overjoyed to see that the snowpeas that I’ve been cultivating for about 4 months now are finally bearing fruit. Like me, they’ve had to show a lot of determination in a place with so little arable land! Boxed in next to my window in a little window-size container they are now happily producing. I can’t wait to taste them. To celebrate the occasion, I’ve asked two friends for dinner next week. I’ve already tried the lettuce I’ve been growing, and to be honest, it didn’t seem like anything special, but my friends pronounced it very “fresh!”
It seems like things might be turning a corner for me as well. For most of this month I’ve been able to come home before the sky turned black, my email inbox has never gone over 101 unopened messages, I’ve finally gotten most of my address changes done and my Christmas decorations are finally down! I’m hopeful that my growing understanding of school life and the reduction of my weekly hours will enable me to have something left to give or do after the day’s work is over.
Thank you, Lord!
I'm not exactly sure what to feel at this point. As a little girl you grow up believing your father is like superman and nothing can hurt him except for kryptonite. As you get older of course, that belief fades and you realize that he is human just like everyone else. But a part of you still wants to hold on to it. Watching my father in that hospital bed made me truly understand how fragile life truly is..........I'm going to miss my daddy.........I hope he found a happier place to be.
Sometimes we  wonder, 'What did I do to deserve this?' or 'Why did God have to do this  to me?' Here is a wonderful explanation! A daughter is telling her Mother  how everything is  going wrong, she's failing algebra, her boyfriend broke up with her and  her best friend is moving away. 
Meanwhile, her Mother is baking a  cake and asks her daughter if she would like a snack, and the daughter  says, 'Absolutely Mom, I love your cake.' 
'Here, have some  cooking oil,' her Mother offers. 
'Yuck' says her  daughter. 
'How about a couple raw eggs?' 'Gross,  Mom!' 
'Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking  soda?' 
'Mom, those are all yucky!' 
To which the mother  replies: 'Yes , all those things seem bad all by themselves.. But when  they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully delicious  cake! ' 
God works the same way. Many times we wonder why He would  let us go through such bad and difficult times. But God knows that when He  puts these things all in His order, they always work for good! We just  have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something  wonderful! 
God is crazy about you. He sends you flowers every  spring and a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He'll  listen. He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your  heart. 

I don't know who wrote this, it was sent to me and I wanted to share .. cute! I just wanted to remind you all that if you need prayer or just someone to talk to just send me a message! I'm here for YOU! Alrighty tell me what you thought of this! Tell me about your ingredients!!
I recently received an email regarding being Catholic and boycotting the latest instalment of the series that sent many a devout Catholic seething into pits of Rage (one of the 7 deadly sins, ironically). Funny though, in a related link, the Vatican doesn't seem to care too much. Is this a case of a different kind of crucifixion in today's age of finding an identity?
The person that shares my life and space on occasion, just happens to be named on deed and possession, as I am on theirs. A protection thing for both of us, assuring that the other will oversee all, if one of us cannot.

We share the space of the abode, bedroom each (though somehow I got the small one without the walkin closet.) and we share the computer/office room and the other open spaces of the house. But, it seems I type too loud, and so the other must move office and their computer to another space, and I can keep the old. But, though the big bedroom is twice the size of mine, there seems not enough room for ALL the office equipment. So, additional space is claimed for that purpose, Half the sunporch/entertainment room. The rational being, "it's half my house and you have your room, the computer room, the living room, the kitchen, and I need more space for meetings and connsultations, etc . ." . . .but . . .seems to me some of that "my" space is joint, enjoyed by both.

I do not want the sunroom halved, for the purpose of providing more office space, when there was already room enough in the computer room. And, I do not type too loud . .not always. The sunroom is a many-windowed and sunny room with views in three directions, also giving access to the yard and pool. The best room in the house (not counting the other bedroom with walkin closet)

I am impossible.
I am selfish.
It is NOT about me.

I fear I shall soon be part owner of a duplex.
Friends? 

I'm the chewing gum stuck to your sole. I'm the rain that soaks your trousers. I'm the crumbs in your bed. I'm the shoelace that breaks when you're in a hurry. I'm the rubbish you forgot to put in the bin. I'm the person who forgets to listen when you talk. I'm the glob of toothpaste on your newly-washed sweater. I'm the song you can't get out of your head. I'm the monotonous sound that wakes you up when you've taken the morning off. I'm the clothes you've become tired of. I'm the shoe that chafes your foot. I'm the food with too many calories. I'm the wind that wrecks your hairdo. I'm all the people who stare when you're feeling sad. I'm the headache the day after. I'm the telephone that rings when you've just fallen asleep. Will you still be my friend?
Eugh. The past two days, ive seen you twice. You know what, it still kills me. I attempt to talk to you now, and its like nothing. It's like we've never met. I can't believe it all stilled happened. I can't believe i fell for YOU. What an idiot ay ? We used to be so close. You'd lend me your jacket, walk me home, make sure i gave YOU a hug and you ran after me when i was upset and we sat and talked for hours. You made me feel so amazing. A feeling ive never felt before. You knew my family, maaaaan didn't they fucking love you. You made sure i was always safe, you took care of me when we out that night in that club, even after what happened at that party. Don't tell me you never felt anything for me, cus we both know that's a lie. I just can't believe after everything, our friendship means nothing to you anymore. I miss you. I NEED to get over you. In my own way i have. I've HAD to. I just can't believe you were to fucking scared to get it a chance. Just remember, if you're ever reading this, you told me once, you couldnt lose anymore people in your life, i understood you, you used to try so hard to make sure we never lost contact. You'd even make the time in your "busy" life to see me after school, and we'd sit in subway chatting about your hard times :/
I can't believe it came to this, we were so close, still could've been, probably would have made my life so much fucking easier. But no, you took the coward's way out, becus you were "too scared" well from now on. I'm never letting you in my life again. You had your chance. I love you. End of.
OK, How many of you like to receive a nice letter in the mail from a friend?  I know I do.  Even though most of the time I get the mail from the mailbox it is junk mail, I still enjoy the wonder of "will there be a letter?"  On small occasions there is a letter that you open and savor.  A nice card from a friend far away with actual hand written words, possibly in a colorful pen.  You read it once, you read it twice, you may read it everyday for a week or longer.  It inspires you to write one back and maybe even write a letter to a different friend.  In this technological world we all email, face book, blog, etc..... and don't get me wrong I love them all, but what has happening to letter writing.  We say we have no time, but really how many hours do we spend on the computer blogging or facebooking. So why has this art form lost its value?  It has lost its value so much that post offices are closing.  Mail delivery may be shortened by a day.

I had the wonderful opportunity to live on Martha's Vineyard for a period of my life . During that time I was an avid letter writer.  Nothing like living on a New England Island in winter to motivate letter writing.  There was this wonderful little store in Vineyard Haven, called Paper Tiger.  It was filled with uniques cards, papers,pens, stamps and stationary sets.  I would walk into town and peruse the store for hours picking out just the right cards for people and write letters.  I think I will make someone happy this week and write them a letter and in the mean time support the postal service.  Just think what would happen if it closed.  Many books and history have been written and recorded through letters.  Let's keep our history going!   Happy writing.
I had all these ideas for blog posts about decorating my new house... err, I mean the house we want and are currently in escrow for. You see, this house is thirty years old and absolutely begging for cosmetic work, all in time of course ($$$!). However admist my day dreaming I realized that this house could very well not go through for lord knows what reason. And here I am, planning my life away like I always do. Let's focus on the present, April.
So ladies and gents, I present you with my new blog layout. I made about five other collages for the header that I may take a vote on, or ask the hubs since my friends on here are quite lacking. Yes yes, I know I just renovated this place not too long ago, but I needed something to take my mind off of possibility. I am in control of this layout, you see, and it just feels right.
Thoughts? I am feeling irritated. Perturbed. Surrounded by crazy folks (family, patients) and people who want my money (tax time and despicable landlords).  So this morning as a means to debrief I turned to a picture of my own version of Walden Pond, which led me to Thoreau; Walden and Civil Disobedience:
Now I think about the lives and trials of these women, and then my own. Will there be a reward for me, here on this earth? I don't know. There may not be. But I can't live my sick life waiting for it. It's difficult, more difficult than many can imagine. Having epilepsy, Crohn's, depression, anxiety attacks [which are the worst things on the face of the earth], nightmares, and now back pain and some kind of cold virus. I'm literally *never* healthy. But I take comfort in the fact, the knowledge I am certain of, that one day, I will be completely healed of all my ailments. And I will see Regina, and Betsy, and little Layla Grace, and they will all be healthy too, celebrating God's greatness. I look forward to that day. Until then, I wait. Something I don't like doing, but maybe I'll do some good while I'm at it.

It helps, to write my thoughts as I'm going through them. Instead of thinking about it all beforehand, just starting and writing, continuing as I realize new things. So, really, this is more for me than anyone else...
Shopping that is environmentally friendly and easy on the pocket?? Why that would be a clothes swap party my friend! Yes as the Fashion society at Uni we decided to host one this week. Basically you brings some of your clothes that you no longer wear along and then swap them for somebodys else's castaways et voila you have new gear that didn't cost you a penny! You know what they say one man's rubbish is another's riches...(that is what they say, right?). Well anyway it was very successful, I got myself a lovely new bag and jumper out of the deal. I would highly recommend you all try it.
I also booked my flights to London with my girls yesterday! We are heading for a short break in the easter hols to treat ourselves to plenty of shopping, sight seeing and show stopping adventures. Camden market is on my list of top 5 places in the entire world, so I am very excited to be going back! It's such a mesmerising place, so diverse and exciting. And they have the best doughnut stand I have ever seen. I'm tres excited!
OK, so I know that the blog is supposed to be about Psychology, but I have another passion, Photography. And sometimes the tog in me has to come out and play. Like one night last week, when Cas came home from school demanding to go out, and Gaz suggested we go for a walk. There's a resovoir not too far from us called Entwhistle, which is really pretty. So we decided to go there. I grabbed my camera bag with a "I'll only kick myself if I see a shot and haven't got my camera" and off we went. I was soooooo glad I'd grabbed my camera when we got there! The sun was setting and the lake was partly frozen. The light was amazing, the colours were incredible. It was a VERY slow walk, with my boys sighing every time I lifted the camera again. But I think it was worth it! Judge for yourself......
How was everyone's weekend? Well last week I did promise I would 'do' a post (is that proper blog-inology?) about my Television work in Australia and the US over the past 6 years, so here goes!

At the ripe age of 20, fresh out of Griffith University where I studied Film and Media (there you go Simon Cowell, I am well educated :), I landed my first major gig hosting a daily kids show on the Nine Network Aust. called 'Hot Source'. This was my training ground for hosting, editing, segment producing, and script writing.My next major move was hosting the daily show 'Studio Disney' on the Disney Channel. I LOVED loved loved this job so much! I was lucky enough to travel around the world and Australia, and work with the most amazing team. Disney really taught me a lot about the international TV industry, and the work ethics and brand values they hold are second to none.
Hippocrates is known for the Hippocratic oath that medical doctors are sworn by. Hippocrates was the first known physician. His name is also where the word hypocrite originates from. I’m not sure how it correlates with medicine but I’ve come to know plenty of hypocrites. Some believe being hypocritical is sometimes in others best interest. Me? I disagree. If people ask questions they can’t handle the answer to..Why ask? I’m a rather sensitive soul yet I can appreciate brute honesty any day...over simple hypocritical bullshit! Don’t keep it Real. Keep it Sincere...Your reality may be askew from mine......
When I was younger, I loved stuffed animals. I had so many stuffed animals in my room and even more beanie babies. Whenever I did get a new stuffed animal, I would always pick one out and then second guess my choice. I would worry about not "saving" the other animals from the store.

I vividly remember being in a gift shop of a hotel and picking out a new stuffed animal. There were essentially two different choices. I could get the dog with the brown spots or the dog with the black spots. But it was so much more complicated than that with me. I chose the dog with the brown spots and then I wondered which of the brown-spotted dogs to choose. I closed my eyes quickly picked one up. When I opened my eyes, I looked at all the dogs still on display that I hadn't chosen. I promised myself that when I came back to the hotel, I'd "save" the rest of them.

So you can only imagine my struggle in picking out a guinea pig to save at the pet store. The poor little furballs had probably never been touched since they'd arrived at Pet Co. and they're all in the clear plexi-glass boxes, which are horrible for them to begin with, with crappy bedding (litterally) and such little space to move. Thank god we had to get a girl (since Mike's sister has a girl guinea pig and we want them to play together without having to worry about little baby guinea pigs), or else the decision would have taken hours.

There were four female guinea pigs available at Pet Co. the day we went in to get our guinea pig. There were two white ones which I quickly eliminated, sadly, completely based on the color of their skin. They had the red eyes and just didn't look like guinea pigs really. I felt so bad for them because they would probably not be adopted for a while.. maybe not ever. Just thinking about them now is making me sad. I should have been less appearance-focused and maybe got one of them, but I didn't.

It was incredibly hard to decide between the other two. I had liked the one's that fur looked like a calico cat's. Mike liked the brown one with the white stripe. The guinea pig would be mine, but I wanted Mike to love her too. It was all my decision and I was bringing her into our apartment and he promised he would help financially and with feeding and cleaning her cage. I knew I would love which ever guinea pig we chose.

The calico one was especially cute because her nose was even spotted-- half was white and half was black. But the one with the white stripe was a lot more active. We had actually came to Pet Co. three times in the week and she was always awake and jumping around the cage. The calico one was always asleep. Also, Mike and I had decided on a name beforehand, Pikachu, and the brown one looked more like a "Pikachu" to me. So based on her personality, the name we chose and Mike's previous opinion that he liked the brown one more, I chose the brown one.
