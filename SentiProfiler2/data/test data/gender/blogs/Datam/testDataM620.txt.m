"friendship"- we've given a new definition for tht.. paradoxical attitudes and unsynchronized thoughts..nevertheless we stand for each other... i thank the almighty for bringing this person into my life... without him, my college life would hv been a nighmare.... to be straight- he is the GODFATHER for me... (an ardent ajith fan too)..
