This man made-do with whatever was handy. The poor guy was splashed repeatedly by passing traffic. Well, that's how a friend of mine refers to The Captain's Arms, a local pub that's jumping once the weather turns cooler in Abu Dhabi. Like almost all liquor-serving establishments, it's located in a hotel (private clubs can serve, as well). These photos, taken with my camera phone after a few tasty pints, are of a 3 man band that starts in the Italian restaurant directly beside the Captain's Arms (Papagallo's) and eventually wanders over to pub's customers playing pretty much any song you request. Give them a 20 or 30 dirhams, and they'll hang around your table for a few extra songs. Oh, how the 'kids' love these! They zip, they zoom, and they generally annoy...especially if you're in the desert and trying to keep your activity of duning a safe one. I posted a cooler dune buggy shot here. I felt it worthy of a post. These photos were taken by my mother in Ohio. If you haven't seen the stories, the east coast of the US (all the way down to Florida) has been hit with record-breaking lows, while up north they've been dumped on with snow. My parents live in what Great Lakes folks like to call the snow belt. These photos are evidence of the snow belt.Those are deck chairs and table covered in snow.
