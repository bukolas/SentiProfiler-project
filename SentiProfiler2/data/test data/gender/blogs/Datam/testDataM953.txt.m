I want to thank you god for everything I have, I know I'm not a rich man, but I'm not poor either. There’s others who are worse of than I.I know when my time comes to leave this world, I hope I can lay not in a hospital bed but in my own, I won't lay in sadness or fear, nor hate as I made peace with those who speak out against me. When I grow old and time stands at a halt for those few seconds. I will take my last breaths and sing my death song and prepare for a better world. As my spirit leaves my fragile body I know you will guide me to a place where I will lay in peace.

But I know I have a purpose on earth and a given time to do good things for those who need me. I'm not sad nor depress. I surrender myself to you lord and ready to fight the good fight and help those who walk into my life. I know I'm your lonely man lord no matter where I go I'm alone on this earth. But Lord you made me your patient man and I will stand the test of time to do what's right and to be good to others who need me. All I ask is a little time to have in this world and to be the man that I was meant to be. That’s all I want in life, that’s all I ask for.
