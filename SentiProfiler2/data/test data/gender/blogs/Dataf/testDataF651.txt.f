g ready to head out, we recieved an invite to preview an art gallery that was getting ready for 'Dia de los Muertos'. Besides it presented me with an opportunity to take more pics! Dia de los Muertos also known as The Day of the Dead, is a holiday celebrated in Mexico and by Latin Americans living in the United States and Canada. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. The celebration occurs on November 1st, and 2nd in connection with the Catholic holiday of All Saints' Day which occurs on November 1st and All Souls' Day which occurs on November 2nd. Traditions include building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these gifts.   We actually enjoyed our visit at the art gallery as well as the rest of our ride. I still have alot to learn about my camera and hope to post more often. Thanks for stopping by! Remember my post back in April, about The Cherylann of the Hotel Jeffrey Benefit? Well Cherylann posted this comment to me October 14th and I decided to post it.Sheila &amp; Friends,What a pleasure running across your site!Thank-you sooo much for being a part of the benefit run that my friends put on in April.
