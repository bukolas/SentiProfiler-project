Tonight at the Metro Atlanta Beekeepers' meeting, Cindy Bee, Master Beekeeper who has been working with bees since she was a child, presented a program on how to catch swarms.First she addressed the reason that bees swarm.  She suggested that we think of the hive as an entity and that when a swarm happens, it is the hive reproducing itself.  In other words, the swarm is the hive's "baby."  Bees swarm in springtime because the arrival of pollen stimulates the queen to lay her eggs.  The hive begins to build up the numbers of bees and gets overcrowded.The workers, not the queen, make the decision to swarm.  First they make a replacement queen by choosing several eggs and creating queen cells (feeding the new larvae only royal jelly).  Then they make the old queen run round and round the hive to slim her down.  Finally they run her out the front door.  When she flies away, anywhere from 20 - 80% of the bees in the hive follow her.  This event  = a swarm.Meanwhile back at the original hive, the queen cell hatches and the new queen emerges.  That queen kills any queens still inside their queen cells and begins the process of getting ready for her mating flight.  Swarming delays and impacts honey production because the hive is diminished in numbers and the queen has a while before she is mated and laying so there is a disruption in the hive build-up.The swarm that left the hive hangs wherever the queen landed while the workers fly out to possible sites for new hives.
