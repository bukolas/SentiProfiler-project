The is a reviewer favorite, and the iPhone 3GS (the S stands for speed) receives accolades as well, although reviewers aren't quite as enthusiastic. Available and 32 GB  versions, the 3GS boasts an upgraded 600 MHz processor (up from 412 MHz) and 256 MB of RAM, double that of the iPhone 3G's 128 MB. Testing by editors at MobileTechReview.com, PCMag.com and others shows that the 3GS is indeed noticeably faster in loading contacts, email, websites, games and various apps. Other than circuitry upgrades, most of the improvements to the iPhone 3GS are software-based, and many reviewers point out that current iPhone 3G owners can simply download the iPhone 3.0 software for free. Nearly every reviewer recommends buying the new iPhone only if you have the original iPhone or haven't yet taken the iPhone plunge.
