I survived the day. Had a hard time waking this AM but made it somehow. Work was interesting had a headache most of the PM, wonder if it was Caffeine as I had a coffee this AM and then a Pepsi. Had an instant ice pack on neck and shoulder most of afternoon. Was told by a couple of people should go home. Told them kinda hard with no sick time left and they just looked. If they only knew. I made 3 out of 4 metrics on Friday and 2 out of 3 for week. Pretty sure am off to good start for this week but who knows. Better yet who gives a shit. really,.
