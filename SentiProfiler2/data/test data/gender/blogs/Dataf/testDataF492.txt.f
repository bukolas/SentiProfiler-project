If yu can find the most coolest person in the world,then vivek bro is one amongst em!!That's why i call him as UC Vivek..dats Ultra Cool Vivek!!..He's a big fan of ajith sir and DADA..in fact a big admirer...That's how we got to know each other...He kicks off his day(not only his,but others' day too) with an inspirational quote....

He's got abundant talent in mechanics..he's juz too good in it...he's a multi faceted person yu know..and a multi-langual(outta d book ) person too...He exactly reflects yu..I have neva seen him lose his coolest attire...he will be there 4 yu,when yu need...He is a good chef too....he keeps things simple...a happy go lucky bro..He is modest ,coz he wont show off things even thou he knows a million bucks.....

I juz cant keep out cool outta vivek na..to say the least he is juz tooooo cool a guy yu can get...He does things classically..he has his own style that no one can dare to have or imitate.
