United Services Auto Association (USAA) is far and way the best insurance company in the world, bar none.I guess that's a bit of hyperbole. But I can't think of any organization I have dealt with that is more entitled to a rave.I became a member of USAA when I was an officer in the US Air Force in the late 1950s. 50+plus years has given me ample opportunity to test the performance of USAA. They have never let me down.
