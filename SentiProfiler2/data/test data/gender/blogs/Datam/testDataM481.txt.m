Between snow-melt and rain, Bishkek was a grim portent of what spring will be like in Naryn, whenever it finally decides to come. Mud mud mud was the name of the game. Bishkek has plenty more paved roads than in Sunny Naryn, and that bodes poorly for what extremes our mud situation might entail. The high mountains of snow excavated from the neighborâ€™s driveways and yards leaves me fearful as to how my shoes, socks and pant-cuffs will survive. Thankfully though, that trial is still months away.
