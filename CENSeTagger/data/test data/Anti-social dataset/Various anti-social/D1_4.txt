Been feeling a little off lately, lost, lonely, etc. I put a new blade in my razor knife this week and drug it down my arm a few times very slowly just enough so a little blood surfaced and leave a little scab. I made me feel better. So the next day at work when in the briars I took a big ol briar limb and snapped it off and run it up and down my arms and it gave me total relief of something and ive felt so much more alive and no I dont feel any guilt about it. Will do it again very soon when I start feeling off again if thats what it takes to keep me going. Does anyone blame me? The briar limb made me look like ide been in a fight with a big dam cat. Blood was running all down my arms. It felt so good. I felt like a totally different person. My views and outlook on life change when I do this, No its not normal to the average person but it is for people like me. I see nothing wrong with it.
