Last night I was overjoyed to see that the snowpeas that I’ve been cultivating for about 4 months now are finally bearing fruit. Like me, they’ve had to show a lot of determination in a place with so little arable land! Boxed in next to my window in a little window-size container they are now happily producing. I can’t wait to taste them. To celebrate the occasion, I’ve asked two friends for dinner next week. I’ve already tried the lettuce I’ve been growing, and to be honest, it didn’t seem like anything special, but my friends pronounced it very “fresh!”
It seems like things might be turning a corner for me as well. For most of this month I’ve been able to come home before the sky turned black, my email inbox has never gone over 101 unopened messages, I’ve finally gotten most of my address changes done and my Christmas decorations are finally down! I’m hopeful that my growing understanding of school life and the reduction of my weekly hours will enable me to have something left to give or do after the day’s work is over.
Thank you, Lord!
