his straightener is okay, when I first got it I was so excited, it worked great but I was noticing that after awhile it didn't work as good. It's been 5 months now and when I put it on a lower temperature it automatically turns off, and the plate covering is all chipped off. So basically I am going to have to buy another straightener due to I can't use this one anymore or it will chip even more. If you are planning on buying this product, I highly recommend you take extra good care of it or it will definitely break soon enough. I am going give the sedu a shot!
