Aside from health care being a right not a privilege we need to get a CAP put on prescription drug prices. I recently lost a job and almost had to start paying for my injections out of pocket ($498 per injection) one per week. That is $1500 per month for only one of my prescriptions. When I took into consideration all 5 of them it would cost me almost $3000 per month ! What would be the alternative if my husband was not able to get his insurance to pick me up? Suffer and die? No wonder you see so many elderly people giving up and going into crime. WAKE UP BUSCH !!!
