I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 38, line 3, after 'above', insert
'or which would have been so required but for subsection (3) below'
The amendment clarifies an apparent anomaly regarding the provision of details of proprietors where partnerships of more than 20 persons are concerned. The amendment makes it clear that subsection (2) applies to require details of proprietors to be furnished in writing immediately for partnerships of more than 20 persons to any person with whom anything is done or discussed in the course of a business and who asks for such names and addresses.
