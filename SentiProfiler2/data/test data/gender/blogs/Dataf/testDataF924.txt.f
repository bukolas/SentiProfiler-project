These last two weekends have been full of friends, laughter and general good times. First we had a long-awaited "Malteser" dinner here in Roch, which we thoroughly enjoyed. 

Last weekend, we spent a lovely couple of days in Reading for the wedding of my friend Kate and her now-husband Tony. We had an absolute blast - I haven't danced that much since my own wedding... and it was a bonus to have some cooperation on the part of my feet this time round!

On the way back home, we stopped at Hampton Court and went for a leisurely walk by the river and reveled in the sunshine for a couple of hours. 

On another note, the job I mentioned a while back unfortunately didn't work out, so I am back home restarting the job hunt once again, but this time making certain to enjoy the free time I have as opposed to resenting it. 

Fellow blogger Allison over at In a Nutshell wrote these words yesterday, which perfectly sum up the way I feel right now:

"Let this post serve as a simple reminder to myself to make the most of each day, and to be utterly thankful for the days that I have here under the sun and the stars. Let it serve as a simple reminder to bask in the beauty of this world and to let its warmth drench my soul."

Next week, I'll be painting our bedroom! You know what that means, don't you? More random wall and paint pictures to come, lucky lucky you! *wink*
