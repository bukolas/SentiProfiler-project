'I remember my mom paddling me and sending me to my room as a kid.  I don\'t remember what I had done wrong, but she told me to clean my room while I was in there, and I was so angry all I could do was to throw all my stuff around my room.  I remember being so angry that I wrote \" I hate my mom\" in big letters across a piece of poster board I had in my room.  Later, after everything settled down, my mom came up to my room and told me everything was OK, like she did after every time she got angry at me.  She saw the posterboard and I thought I was going to be right back in trouble again, but she started to cry instead and hugged me.  Then we went downstairs and ate supper.The most positive memory I have of my dad is when I ran away from home in high school.  I remember packing a bag with some clothes and stuff and had a friend pick me up while my parents were out.  I spent most of that night downtown, hanging out on the street, wondering what to do next.  The reason this memory comes to mind as positive is because, later that night, after wandering around downtown for a long time not knowing what was going on in my head, I spotted my parents in their car driving around the streets, looking for me.  They both looked really upset, not upset in an angry way, more of in a worried, frantic way.  I remember hiding in an alley and watching them drive by, saw the looks on their faces.  Up until that point, I hadn\'t realized how much they really cared about me.  I didn\'t come out right away, though, because I was still confused about what I wanted.  They kept driving around, looking for me, until I came out and met them at the street.  I\'ll never forget the look on their faces, a mixture of love and relief.The earliest memory I have of my mother is when we moved from Memphis, TN to NC.  We had a moving company pack our stuff in a truck and take it ahead of us, and we pulled a trailer behind our car with some odds and ends in it.  To leave Memphis, we somehow ended up crossing the Mississippi River which, at the time, had a maze of interstate clover leaves, merging lanes, roads under others, all right out there above the river.  My mom kept screaming at my dad to slow down, because she was really scared we were going to run off the bridge and into the river.  My dad kept telling her that he was already going as slow as he could with out stopping, but it didn\'t matter to my mom: we could have been at a dead stop and she still would have been freaking out.  I remember sitting in the back seat, watching mom losing it.  She was plastered all over the dashboard and headliner with her hands and feet, as if she were bracing herself for a fall.  She had slipped over towards the driver\'s seat as far as she could go, right up beside my dad, just to get away from her side of the car, from which you could look out and see a drop of about 400 feet to the river below.I am very close to my mom and I love her very much.The most positive memory I have of my dad is when I ran away from home in high school.

'My father and I have always spent time together and I know that I can remember farther back than this but for some reason the earliest memory that I can think of right now  is \"helping\" my father work on the car when I was four years old. This is a positive memory because he gave me the chance to spend time with him doing something that he cared a lot about, his car.  Although I do remember a few tense moments when he could not get something to work the way that he wanted, he never took it out on me.  I know he probably thought that I was just in the way but he still let me help.    My mother grew up on a farm just as I have and so for most of my life I have seen her in the kitchen cooking.  She is also a professional beautician but only works two days a week so she can take care of my grandmother and wanted to be near my sister and I as we grew up.  I don\'t know the age I was when I first saw mother in the kitchen but I am sure that is my earliest memory of her. This is a positive memory of my mother because it showed my sister and I how much family meant to our mother.  For her to quit working full time to stay with us and take care of my grandmother really meant a lot to us.    Both of my parents had poor financial backgrounds.  My father grew up in the slums of  the city and my mother was one of eight children that helped to keep the family farm going.  From this background they saw only the environment around them and have never been exposed to other cultures and peoples.  From this they sometimes exhibit hostility to others for trying to get by without working for what they get.  This sometimes comes  across as a prejudicial stereotype.  I also believe that everyone should work for what they get but I have an open mind to new and different points of view; my parents do not.  I can not blame my parents for how they were raised but I do feel ashamed at times of the narrow-mindedness that they can still display.  this is ongoing. We have a good relationship.  I love my mother very much and I know that she loves me.  She is always there for me and will do anything for me.  I tell her everything, well almost everything.  If I have a problem she is there with the solution.Grandpa was a farmer and everyone on the east coast seemed to know him so when he died everyone seemed to fall apart, everyone but my mother.  She loved my grandfather as much as anyone else, even more, but she knew that there were things that had to be done and they had to be done now.  She took it upon herself to make all arrangements and let the rest of the family mourn.  She knew that there would be plenty of time for that later.  She was strong and brave and I have never been more proud of her.My most positive memory of my dad is probably of him taking the family to the beach.  It was not our first time or even our best but I remember it well.  I was eight years old and dad, my sister,  and I had gone out to the ocean.   I wanted to play in the water but he wouldn\'t let me go by myself, so even though he was dead tired he still took my sister and I to the water.  We had a great time and although he was so tired he never once said no when we asked him to throw us or put us on his shoulders.  It was nothing then but now I see it as a symbol of his dedication and devotion to us and our family. Both of my parents had poor financial backgrounds.

'I remember feeling very anxious many times  when it was very clear that my parent\'s relationship was faultering. Of course it was equally the fault of both parents  but  then I percieved the problems as being due to my dad\'s inadequacies. I suppose that is because the male is usually depicted as the authority of the house. I do remember discovering that  my dad was not wrong as a person  instead their marriage had enough flaws to be irreconcillable.Not many singular positive memories that I can recall  off-hand. I always did, until the early  teens, enjoy lying in my parents bed with   my mom. We would usually have snacks and take in a pretty big dose of TV. I remember how comforting it was to lay there and feel safe and then drift off to sleep. I remember my father as being a dedicated pharmacist that always gave special attention to the 5 acre yard and the small garden. I remember enjoying \"helping\" him in both the yard and at the drug store. It was a good time for us to share together, I guess. I remember  being very  happy to greet my dad at the door after some of his twelve hour days at work. In retrospect,  I now he must have often been tired (he often did admit to that) but he was always ready to listen, if not a little distracted by his fatigue.  I remember a long time ago when we would go to the beach (as a family) and my dad and I would always seem to be the most carefree. We liked it when  we could just relax in the swells of the ocean.

He had cancer and a large portion of his intestines were removed and in it\'s place was a cholostomy bag which had to be cleaned and changed several times a day.

My father was very close to me and we always did things together.  I feel that I was closer to him than I was to my mother.My father always took me hunting in the fall.  We had a great time together.  He and I loved to be in the woods whether we were hunting,  working, or just walking around.  He showed me how to scout for game, shoot a gun, and clean what we killed.  It was very cold, but we both enjoyed it.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.17,0,0,13.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.46,0,0,6.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.56,27.12,0,0,0,0,6.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.39,Male37
' I had been running my own business for about five years, while working another full time job.  My business had not become as successful as I had hoped it would with the great amout of hard work that I had put into it.  At about this same time I had been dating a very special person and we had decided to get married.  Because of the financial position of my business i decided to close it after a great amount of thought.  There was one problem with this,  the property that my business was located on was a gift from my father and he would be very upset if I sold it, I thought.  After much  distress over this decision I finally got the nerve to first talk to my mother about my decision.  This might have seen somewhat childish to some but I did not want my parents to be disappointed in me over my decision. \tAfter explaining the situation to my mother she agreed with me and said that she had already talked with my father about this. This was the greatest relief that I had ever felt.The earliest memory of my mother was when my when my mother and father brought my younger brother home from hospital after he was born.  My older brother, my cousin,and myself were playing outside at my great grandmother\'s house when my parents drove up with my new brother. There was a lot of joy at that moment for everyone present, which was my entire family.  I remember my mother sitting in the passenger seat holding my new brother in her arms and smiling.  I also remember  her telling me to come and see my new brother.My father had taken me hunting with him which was a great thrill for me.  After being in the woods for a short time my father fell asleep and deer were walking all around us, but when I tried to wake my father  the deer ran off before he could see them.',5,-4,0.5,2,1,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.7,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.4,0,0,11.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,Male37
'The most positive memory I have of my mother was when she got  remarried earlier this year.  It was a small wedding, yet all of our good friends and relatives were there.  Everyone at the wedding seemed so happy and joyous, like the real problems of life didn\'t matter.  When it came time for the vows, a tear came from my mother\'s eyes.  I finally realized, after a stressful, unfortunate first marrige, that my mother was truly happy and truly in love.  Seeing this, I felt a warm and compassionate inside knowing now she could restart her life in a healthy loving way.I was about 6 years old when we moved to Reisterstown Md.  My parents decided they were going to design their own house.  Of courrse my dad, loving to build and work outside, decided he was going to build and do as much work as he could around the house.   I\'ll never forget the countless hours we spent doing work around that house, day after day building, cleaning and moving brush.  I was proud of my dad and often enjoyed working with him.  But there were many of days  where I was upset with him because of all  the work he made me do.  We have an excellent relationship except  for a few things.  I get very angry and his lack of understanding for my needs.  I get upset a lot of times because it seems he values other things over me. He is constantly putting himself first, and forgetting what I need. I was seventeen and in  10th grade when my father decided to leave the family and move to California.  He had a job offer to become a Vice- President of a newly founded company.  I was at a stage in my life where I needed to be around my father because I was developing so more masculine attributes where I could share and relate better to my father.  I\'ll never forget how bad I didn\'t want him to go for he was leaving me and especially  my mother who was already often at bad terms with him.  I knew he was  going to go, so as a self defense mechanism,  I felt bitterness and couldn\'t wait for him to leave.  The next 2 years were tough,  swaying from happiness to hear from him and resentment for times when he wasn\'t there when we needed him.I Was Living in Reisterstown, Md and going to Franklin Elementry School when I have the earliest  and most vivid memory of my  mother.   I was  about 7 years old and in second grade when I was having my first real social crisis.  My mother and I both  thought I should be  a little more assertive.  She knew I was not performing up to my ability  in school, mainly because I was afraid to talk to my teacher.  Of course my mother, being the old wise lady,  knew exactly what I should do  to correct  this problem.  Being a typical know it all kid,  I resisted her suggestions and tried to continue the usual.  The main memory I have about this time was the fact that she constantly pushed me to talk to my teacher, in particular  she wanted me to say,\" Good morning Mrs Treadwell.\"  I remebered how hard it was for me to say this to my teacher, and I felt bitterness and resentment toward my mother for pushing me.  I think I remeber almost shaking a half an hour before class I was so scared.  Ironically , about six months later , after my mom continuously rewarded me and made me feel good, I finally developed an open and freindly  relationship with  my teacher. WE have an excellent and open relationship. She in my opinion appers to be too sensitive sometimes.  I love her very much.My dad was finally living on his own and doing what he wanted to do.  He enjoyed his work and was very glad for him.My mother had another man upstairs that I knew she was getting intimate with.  She was currently married to my dad and it left me really confused and angry.  I didn\'t talk to my mother for weeks for I thought she had betrayed my father.  All is well know because that was the time that pretty much knew that they would break up the relationship.  She is now married to that  strange man.

'The most positive memory of my mother is that she always came to my basketball games as a young kid and a teenager.  I could always count on my mom to be there to see me play no matter who the other team was. Even if she knew that we were going to win because the other team was sorry , she was always there to cheer me on.  The memory was never more evident until my team lost the state championship game as seniors in high school.  As soon as the buzzer sounded she was there to give me a hug and  to comfort  me as she did when I was a small child.  The most negative memory of my father is the memory of my father in itself.  My father and I have never communicated and at this point I don\'t think we ever will.  My father has never done anything for me.  I did not marry mother , and while he was so called in love with my mom he was expectiing a child from another woman.  The only thing my father has ever given me was my other twenty three chromisomes.The most negative memory of my mother is that  my mom often would leave me with relatives that I didn\'t like or just didn\'t know as well as I would have liked too.  It would not have been so bad, but she usually didn\'t tell where she was going or when she\'d be back!  In the back of my  mind I knew  she would be back , but as a young child of maybe five or six, I was terrified.  As a young child I can remember many times crying all night with these people.   My mother was not just leaving me with strange people.  The person or people she left me with was always a family  member that she had asked to baby sit me for awhile.  The only problem was they never told me the plan. The earliest memory of my father that I can recall occured when I was about four or five.  I did not like him then because of the way he looked, and I don\'t like him now because of the way he is.',3,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.29,0,5.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.87,Male37
' I was about 7 years old when my dad told me to get into the closet.  He said their was a tornado approaching our house that we would have to protect ourselves.  I remember asking what was a tornado .   He said it was wind  that could blow trees down. I remember feeling scared but when my dad told me everything was going to be alright and he held  me in his arms ,  I felt very safe and secure from any harm .  Although I do not remember hearing any wind just a lot of rain  I knew nothing could touch me nor my dog Jay because my dad was going to make everything alright. I was about 4 to 5 years old when I remember my father giving me an indoor basketball goal.  I guess since he had played ball in college, he wanted me to get started early.  The  basketball goal was red and blue.  The ball was yellow and felt like a sponge.  I was so happy when my father unwrapped this Christmas present.  I remember him smiling at me and also remembered him asking me if I liked it.  I of course said yes.   My mother is very loving and considerate.  I am more loving to her than anyone in my life.  She is a very giving person .  She supplies me with plenty of money  and clothes. she often worries about me and who I  associate with .   I would do any thing for my mother.  She is also willing  to discuss any problem I might have.  she is great.I was seven years old when one day I went to check on my mother outside while she was laying out in the sun. when i asked her a question she did not answer .  I  thought she was dead.  When I kept asking her to answer me , she did not .  I remember screaming as loud as I could.  She finally sat up and began to laugh.  I was so relieved.I was 5 years old when my mother took me to kindergarten.   I was very scared .  i did not know what to expect.  I did feel a lot of love from my mother .  She told me that  everything would be alright.   I also felt very sad because my mother left me that day.  I could not understand why she left me all alone. I was probably about 10 years old when I saw my dad throw my mother down the deck steps .  I remember screaming at my dad.  He just said that my mother deserved it  and that it was not his fault at all.

'I can tell her anything and we have a mutual love between us. She\'s a pretty great lady.Once when I was 7 years old I went into my father\'s room to wake him up. He hit me very hard in the stomach, knocking me on the ground. I cried hard but he only grew more angry,yelling at me to  \"get my fat little ass out of his room.\" At that age I was very plump and weighed more than anyone else in my class practically. Those words hurt far more than his punch.I never had many  problems with  my mother. She is very loving and our relationship has always been very close. However, she has a habit that  has always bothered me greatly, smoking. She has been smoking since I was born and I have always seen this habit as a blatant disregard of my health, and I say my health because my father smoked also. But one time she was having a conversation with my Aunt, who is a doctor. My Aunt told her  that smoking in my general vicinity at such a young age could potentially be very harmful. My mother replied by saying that she never smoked in my area or anywhere I was around.Of course this was a lie.In my Junior year of High school,  my family had planned a long Christmas trip to Florida in which my father would be reunited with the entire side  of his family. We were going to take the main car of the house, a new Acura. However, one rainy day  I was driving with my girlfriend to the mall and made a left turn accross a lot of traffic. Not that it wasn\'t my fault but my mind was very distracted when my car crashed into a new Nissan Maxima going 35 miles an hour. Anyway  my Dad was about to hit me and she intervened.  The point is is that I ruined the family trip by totalling the car, and my mother was able to see past her initial anger which was something my father could never have done.',5,-4,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.6,11.2,0,2.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male37
'This could also apply to my father though my mother didn\'t like the girl more.  In my senior year, I dated a girl for a year that my  mother couldn\'t stand.  It was probably because honestly the girl was not good for me.  My mother noticed this but me being the naive one in so called love I stood up for the girl.  One night we got in a large fight over her probably the worst one I\'ve ever had.  I defended my girl friend for some unknown reason.  Hey, mom knew best then but I thought she was the biggest!This is an extremely hard question for me to answer.  Not because I\'m hesitant on telling you anything but because as far back as I can remember my father has never gotten too terribly upset with me.  I guess I\'ll have to say when I came to college in the Fall of 1990 I had an unusually hard time adjusting to the new life.  My father was sympathetic at first but eventually he reached a point where he did not understand me any more.   I guess he thought I was crazy since it seemed to him I had the world within my grasp.  For the first time we grew apart because he didn\'t understand my position.When I was accepted here at State, he was so proud of me.  I was the center of attention, and everyone he came in contact knew.  This was a really big deal since my older brother didn\'t go to college.  I could just see how happy he was and proud of me.  I never felt like I hadn\'t done anything to please him but this was the ultimate.  I know he can\'t wait til next May when I graduate from here.Me and my mother are extremely close.  Unfortunately, I\'m a very open person and she knows an awful lot about my life.

I didn\'t think she totally approved of my fiance, but she helped me decide when to ask her and even offered to pay for the ring.The most positive memory I have of my father is when he actually went and bought the engagement ring that I gave to my fiance.  This act let me know how much he loved and accepted the girl that I would soon marry. I remember my mother as the person who would always care for me and help me whenever necessary.  My first distinct  memory was going to the Fast Fare and getting a candy bar everyday when she would pick me up from the daycare center.The most negative memory of my mother is when she tried everything she could think of to end my relationship with my girlfriend. She absolutely hated that girl, but at the time I cared about her.  She would forbid my to go and see her.  She would constantly talk about how bad she was to me and other people in my family.

I don\'t remember why but I do remeMber being angry.  it was probably about school or dating.Dad is great. I enjoy working on mechanical things with him and solving household problems.

'I was about to recieve a spanking, for what I don\'t remember.  Disobedience, to be sure.  My mother got out the slender, wooden paddle she used for the job and I remember I ran to my room and tried to lock the door to keep her from me.  I was unsuccessful, and as she came into the room, I knew that what I had just done would but add to the punishment.  I ran to the far wall, screaming at the top of my lungs, because I was very afraid.  I backed against the wall and looked about, seeing the leuvered windows began to scream as loud as I could for somebody to help me, as we two were alone in the house.  I continued on for perhaps a full minute, and then stopped, realizing that the expected spanking had not occurred.  I saw my mother standing  by the door crying, presumably at the way she had terrified her child in an effort to discipline him.   I don\'t remember any more.My father is a great man, and I see a lot of him in me, something I take pride in, but he has a tendency to control to tightly, and it is something that has put a stumbling block in out relationship.  He is a hearty christian soul, and because of this and his teachings we\'ve been able to love and accept each other for what we are.  That is the whole Idea, is it not?My family went hiking in the mountains of Hawaii, where we lived until I was 11.  It was a monthly  highlight, but my father and I became separated from the group.  We hiked our way down the mountain, and towards the bottom, we were walking side by side when we both slipped simultaneously and began sliding down the steep of soft earth and leaves almost 20 yards, laughing with the surprise and excitement the entire way.  We liked it so much that we went back and did it again on purpose.  It was a change of character for my father, he was a friend, not an authority.I love her, but I can\'t completely trust her with knowlege of my affairs ( of any nature ) because I know what kind of a person she is.  I don\'t think that we have a negative relationship at all, but I must love her for what she is.  The only reason I couldn\'t trust her is beacause she does thing for \"my own good\" without telling me about them in advance.Earliest memory of my mother is when I had just climbed out of my crib for the first time.  I remember at the time having the impression that I had always been trapped there and was determined to get out.    I somehow knew that I had a very limited time to do this, because someone, I didn\'t know who, was bound to return, and I felt that I had to be long gone from that place before that happened.  When I had managed to climb over the wall of the crib, and was wondering how I was to get past the long drop to the floor, a woman walked in.  I looked at her, and she was strangely familiar to me, but I couldn\'t place her.   I remember feeling both startled and afraid of this woman, and I tried to climb back into the crib. She said, \"Well, look who\'s up!\"  I must have been old enough to speak, or I would not have understood this.  As soon as she spoke, all fear was gone and I knew who she was, although I was strangely enough uneasy about the way that she just walked over and picked me up without hardly any effort.  After all, I had just worked quite a bit just to get out of the crib.  But she was very soothing, and she put me back into the crib after a moment, and I\'m told that I went to sleep almost immediately.When we lived in England, we lived in a stone cottage in a small village just outside of Oxford.  This put me into a local school just down the street.  Every day my sister and I would head down the street towards school, and just as the road would bend into invisibility from the house, I would always turn and wave at my mother who would always be just inside the opened front door, watching me go.  This memory is not confined to any one time, but was a common occurrance for the whole school year.  I always knew that she was just at the end of the road, and that knowledge always filled me with a sense of love and security.',3,-5,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.5,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.52,0,0,7.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.5,12.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.5,0,0,0,Male37
'the earliest memory of my mother was when I was born ( JOKE ).  Actually the earliest memory of my mother was when  she got very angry with my sister and started to yell at her.  In specific my sister who was at that time arounf 5 or 6 years old  had gone across the street and was playing with our neighboor daugther.  when time came for lunch my mother called her, but my sister didn\'t want to come home to eat, because she was having a good time.  As a result my mother went there and brought her home, and warned her that if she continued to behave like that it would be the last time for her to be visiting that house.The most negative memory of my mother was when she was in the hospital.  She was going through a historectomy, and it was probably the firt time I went to the hospital because of a very close member of the family (my mother). She was in a lot of pain, and physically she didn\'t look to well.  That scared me alot, even though I knew that it was a very safe procedure.  My Grandmother (Mother\'s side), and my father were at her side, yet since my sister was off to school I seemed to be alone and in some way afraid.The most negative memory of my father was when he broke his leg trying to save a little kitten which was stuck on a tree. This kitten was roaming around our yard the whole day, and when she saw our dog, she quickly climbed a tall tree.  well, for the rest of the day that kitten was scared and could not come down the tree, so it was making a lot of noise.  When my father came back from work, he was ordered by my mother to get the cat down. All went fine, yet the cat was afraid of my father and she clawed him, making him jump back and slip, and fall from 4 or 5 feet.

'The earliest memory i can recall about my father took place when I was two (possibly three). We were living in Florida at the time and my mother and father had decided to go on a family outing to the beach. I remember sitting on the sand with my mother and watching my dad suit up in some snorkling gear. He then gave a long glance and wave at me and started in the direction of the ocean. In a few moments he disappeared into the water. I looked on with much curiosity. My feelings begin to change to fear when more time had elapsed and my father did not return. I looked into the ocean with sadness, thinking for some strange reason it had swallowed him up. My eyes remained fixed at the water and I looked relentlessly at the water. Just when I was about to be overtaken with tears, my father returned from the ocean. With him he brought beautiful shells and sandollars. You can imagine my relief when he returned. I remember my mom as well as myself being amused with the items he had brought back from his swin into the ocean.The fondest memory I have of my mother ironically occured after a tragic incident concerning her health. It happened shortly after her bout with breast cancer. After a great deal of time and perserverance, my mother had won the toughest struggle of her life. She had overcome the disease and ridded it from her sytem. I was both relieved and proud of my mother. I felt a new admiration and love for her that had never been there before. She remained tough and positive through the whole ordeal. She never tryed to burden us with her emotions and fears, but remained collected in front of my sister and I. It is for this reason that I respect and love my mother so much. In her darkest hour, she put the interest of the family in front of her own.The most negative memory I can recall of my mother was when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer. I was no older then thirteen. When I first recieved the news of my mothers condition It was difficult for me to accept.

'Soccer again would have to be the most fond memory  of him.  But then helping while he made stuff was fun  too.  He is an architect and time with him was somewhat  limited. Any  time with him was fun.  Even now the time I spend with him isn\'t often however it is very precious.My earliest memory of my mother was when my sister was born.  I remember  how happy  she was and how much excitement  there  was.I think that the worst  memory of my  father   was  after  their divorce.  I  had spent the weekend at his house and when it was time for my sister and I to come home my father\'s  wife to be decided to come along for the ride.  She was the reason  one of the outstanding reasons why my parents broke up.  (although  we now have a great relationship)  Anyway when we got our of the car and my mother came out in her usual  greeting after we came back from his place.  I think she always was a little nervous when we came back because I think she feared  that  we would have a better time there  than at home.  So when she came out,  she saw the woman and freaked out .  She rushed out at her and my father had to stop her.  It was the first time that  I had ever seen my father  being forceful with her .  He never abused any of us. it just was not a good time.My  earliest memories of my father were of when  he was the  coach of  my soccer  team.  He was a great coach and I developed a love of the sport that has never died.My relationship with my mom has always been extremely good.  Now she is having a hard time letting me go and last year I couldn\'t wait to get away.  Now I enjoy the time I spend with my family vey much.  It seems like now I want to be close to them. My most positive memory of my mother was when  we were going through the divorce.  She worked very hard and made a point to try and explain everything to me that had happened.

'Three years ago we almost got in a real fight. My girlfriend (who became my wife, God bless her) had gotten pregnant. That caused enough problems by itself. But what happened was my mom thought Kim and I hated her for a lot of complicated reasons which were all misunderstandings. She broke down, finally, and dad told me, stupidly, that he thought some bad things about Kim and I was  too big for my britches. Me and mom and dad were in the bathroom at their house, mom sitting on the counter crying to my right, and dad standing across from me. We all argued until he finally reached over and pushed me back. I got mad and scared at the same time. I was ready to beat the @#$ out of him at that moment. I hit him in the eye hard and I think he realized at that moment that I had grown enough to whip him good. He backed off. If it wouldn\'t have been for me, though, we probably would have went our separate ways that day. I felt that if I left that day, I would never have looked back. Probably I wouldn\'t have seen them again for years and they would have been much more sorry than me.  I really remember how my mom used to scratch my head when I was little. I would lay my head in her lap and she would play with my hair while we watched TV. I can\'t really give any sights or sounds, but I loved her.I have a pretty good memory of dad from before I could walk. Dad carried me down the hall (wood paneling) and turned right, in the middle of the hall, into my room. I can see the crib, the wooden bars on the front. Dad carries me toward it. As I get to it the memory dulls. I don\'t remember any emotions, sound, etc, just sight. Today we still have minor problems, but I love her very much, and she loves me too. I wish we had more time together, but we would probably just squabble at each other.  I can remember laying on the floor of my parents trailer on a baby blanket. I was too little to walk, I think. I remember hearing it thundering outside. I think it scared me.When I looked to my side, I could see under the couch. Mom said something that calmed me down. I think it was something that included the word \"thunder.\" It was dark outside, and it seems like it was pretty dark inside the trailor, too.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.54,0,20.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.34,11.34,0,6.8,0,0,2.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male37

In my teens I wanted a minibike. Dad was always very tight with his money but he bought two used minibikes from our neighbor and another friend. Neither of them were operational, but dad helped me work on them \'til we got them fixed, and has always encouraged me to utilize my mechanical apptitude. The positive memory is that he was so proud of my accomplishments as a mechanic.My mother had a friend, she was an \"old maid\" that used to babysit my brother, sister and me. None of us really liked her because she was very peculiar. One day she was at our house, which mom never was because she went back to school after she sold the bakery, and dad apparently made a pass at her. Of course mom  made a big issue of telling us children which she always does when dad does anything she doesn\'t like, and put dad in the position of feeling he had to explain himself.

' My earliest memory of my mother is when she and I were travelling from Wilmington, North Carolina to Warsaw, North Carolina.  She was a student at UNCW at the time.  I am not sure how far we were into the trip but I remember the car breaking down and us pulling over in someone\'s yard.  I remember it being really dark and cold that night, and about how much I wished we were already at my Grandparent\'s house.  I remember being afraid for my mother as she approached this strange house we had come to.  To make a long story short, she called my uncle who immediately left to pick us up.My most negative memory  of my mother is when she found I had been drinking one time.  Needless to say  she was very angry . I really cannot narrow down all of the wonderful memories I have of  my mother down to just one specific case.  For this reason, the best answer I could give would have to be a description of how wonderful my mother was to me.  Considering the facts that my mother had me when she was only eighteen and my biological father left when I was one year old I would say my mother did an excellent job of being a mother.          Times were tough because she was putting herself through college while working full-time.  Money was always short  but there was always lots of love between us just as there is today.  I did not quite recognize the profoundness of what she was doing at the time but after  now being a college student myself, I certainly understand the sacrifices she must have made in hopes of bettering both of our lives.',4,-5,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.9,0,0,0,6.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.8,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.15,0,0,6.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.9,10.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male37

' One night a week Hee Haw would come on and we would watch that and howl  with laughter and later Daddy would go out and get pizza and orange soda for Rachel and I and sometimes sherbert.  It was a very family  scene.  Perhaps it was  the one night  a week my mother had that she didn\'t have to work. She took atrip with me, my sister, my Aunt, her friend Rose and Rose\'s  little girl Jenny.  We went to Long Island to stay again with my grandfather.  We went by car down (from Maine) then stayed busy the entire time going to museums, the Statue of Liberty, the Bronx Zoo, we rode the train for the first time, we played games the whole way down.  It was a very happy trip.  It felt glamorous and sophisticated.  My grandfather lived a very different life from us in Maine.  He wore business suits to work, drove a Cadillac, had before and after dinner drinks and I decided I liked the city very much.  I  also felt pride in my mom.  She was so smart and cultured.  She was always telling us something, just like the tour guides at the museums.  She was very happy on that  trip.  At home she was constantly working and sleeping or driving my sister and I around.  She worked as a nurse on the 11pm-7am shift.  She was so fun in New York and I thought about that trip often growing up.  I have realized from counseling that I fear disapproval from my mother (consequently she is very encouraging about my life and decisions) that stems from her treating me badly when I went to her about the molestation.  Although she protected me from him (she threatened him and he never tried anything again) she never acknowledged that it happened again and now I worry if she somehow feels I was to blame.  I am afraid to cry in front of her and I get overly emotional and have never known why.  She rarely makes time for me when I go home \"She\'s too busy\".  And often apologizes for it but does not changes her behavior.When I  was probably eight years old I along with an older half sister and older cousin went to my mom and told her that the three of us had been repeatedly sexually molested by our grandfather (my father\'s father).  I don\'t have a memory of this just what my older sister says about it.  However the negative memory of my mother is her reaction to a confrontation I barely remember.  I walked up  to her in my grandmother\'s kitchen (her mother\'s) and told her something specific and horrible Bumpa (that\'s what we all called him) had done to me.  It  was after (I don\'t know how long) us three girls had already told her what he had done.  Anyway she looked really disgusted  and sent out of the room harshly!  I was terrified ashamed, and felt guilty, and was afraid she would not love me anymore.  Nothing more was ever said but the abuse did stop.When he was in and out of the hospital before he died he was very grumpy sick, drugged up and couldn\'t  take care of himself.  He died when I  was eight.  These memories are vague because my mother kept us away from him a lot.Going out with him and my little sister and friend of his \"Slim\" who always made everyone laugh.  Mom was not home and we got into this big old station wagon of Slim\'s which he used to go digging and it smelled of cigarette smoke and low tide. it was a mess but Rachel and I climbed in and we drove to the store and Daddy got us ice cream and we went down  to sit on the rocks while they hung out with the other diggers I think.  I remember feeling kind of car sick and anxious about the whole thing and I wanted to go home a little bit but I wasn\'t  sad and I was very happy to be with Daddy and so was Rachel.

'It was when I was entering this college. He got all emotional and told me how much he loved me the night before I left for State. Usually my father does not really display affection because I suspect that it makes him very uncomfortable. This event really left a huge impression on me.The most negative memory I have with her was the time when she refused to let me do whatever I wanted at that time. My mother has a tendency not to be flexible when she has made up her mind about a certain thing. There was no room for discussion. So far as she was concerned the subject was closed.  Imagine my frustration during that time. That was my negative memory of my mother. I remember my mother as a very positive enforcer in  my life, meaning she directed and motivated almost all my decisions and choices. She always seemed to be there when I did something wrong or right. She never seemed to be wrong about anything and I really felt protected and loved. There was a particular time when I was having a major problem accepting that I could not be the best at a certain talent  (I can\'t really recall what). I remember her assuring me and telling me that that trying your best was what was so important, not who was the best.  I certainly remember lots of hugs.',4,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.44,0,0,8.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female37
'Although  my  mother  passed away when I was three years old, I can still remember a  a couple incedents,  most  of these memories were while she was sick. Although she was very sick, I always remember her love, and smiles that were always on her face.  She always made me feel wanted and extremely special.  The only thing that makes me sad is that I was never really able to know the real person she really was.  I\'ve heard alot about her from my relatives , and all was positive,  and I would do anything for me to see her again and grow up with a mother like any normal childMy father and I always talk about her.  He wants me to know her.  My brothers and I never talk about her, because they were old when she passed away and they get hurt when they talk about her.I\'ve had an excellent relationship with my father since I was a little kid.  He has always been there for me.The most negative nemory of my father  was when I was around 10 years old. The most thing that my father ever hated and still hates now is crying.  This  incident happened while my father was helping me with my math.  I could not understand what my father is trying to explain to me, so tears started running down my face.  Every time I told him that I didn\'t understand, he started yelling more. When my father saw me crying he slapped me across my face, for the first and last time.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.58,0,0,0,0,7.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.16,15.16,0,0,0,0,7.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.58,Female37
'I remember when I was a toddler, my dad would put me on his knees and we would sing songs together sometimes in the evenings after supper.   I know it sounds corny but I loved it.  The songs we sang were all really old and few people know them anymore but every now and then I hear one.My mom was on medication that made her very groggy at the time.  My dad was out of town on business and would be back that night.  I was downstairs watching TV and talking on the phone to a friend of mine.  Mom was upstairs asleep and I heard a loud crash from upstairs.  I called to her but didn\'t hear any response.  At first I didn\'t think anything was wrong but after a while I went up to see what had happened.  When  I got upstairs I found my mom lying on  the bathroom floor , trying to get up. Her mouth was bleeding.  I was very scared and shocked.  I tried to  get her up.  It was difficult .  I was not very strong and she was semiconsious.  She and I managed to get her back to her bed .  I was really worried about her  and so scared that I was trembling.  I kept asking her what I could do for her , but she told me she would be fine and not to be scared.  She had gotten up to go to the bathroom and passed out , hitting her head on the counter on the way to the floor.When I was young we lived in a house with a ditch running through the backyard.  My dad always told me not to go down that ditch up under the street because there were snakes in it.  All the kids in the neighborhood were facsinated with that ditch and we loved to play in it.  One day my dad caught me and he was not happy.  I felt bad that I had gotten caught but worse that I had made him angry and violated his trust.Sometimes now when I am home from school,  my dad and I sit up and talk after my  mom has gone to bed.  It\'s really neat because we talk about all kinds of things.  I tell him about stuff at school and things I think.  He listens and tells me what he thinks and he tells me stories of his childhood and when he was in college and the Korean War.  We can talk for hours sometimes , just like good friends.  Sometimes he tells me stories I\'ve heard many times before and sometimes I get tired, but I always enjoy myself. One summer  my dad had to make a business trip to San Francisco and he took my mom and me with him.  While my dad was in meetings during the day, my mom would go swimming with me, shopping with me and one afternoon we rented bikes and rode around the suburbs of San Francisco.  It is probably one of my most happy memories of my mother because it was  one of the first times we spent time just hanging out together , more like friends or sisters than like a mother and daughter.',4,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,0,0,0,5.55,0,0,0,11.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.55,0,24.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.69,0,0,5.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,16.64,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.94,Female37
'It was after dinner and we were all sitting in the den.  My father was on his hands and knees, we were playing \"horsey\" and I was riding on his back.  He had a tan pair of short on and no shirt, and I kept sliding off.  And when I would fall we would both start laughing.  I felt so close to him at that moment, because my father isn\'t the type who shows his emotions or tells you he loves you.  He showed me he loved me by other means.  Like the game of \"horsey\", and little pet names he had for me.  Because he worked almost 14 hours a day, a lavished any time I could get with him.We were at a wedding about 3 months ago.  He was talking with some gentleman.  He saw me across the room an d notioned me to come over there.  He had the biggest grin on his face I have ever seen.  He introduced me to the man standing next to him.  He says \"This is my daughter ______.  while still looking at the man to see his expression as if he is waiting for some great expression of awe.  Which there was, and then the man began complementing my father on having such a beautiful daughter etc.  I didn\'t think that his grin could get any bigger but it did.  He was so happy and so proud, it made me feel so good.  My relationship with my mother is very close.  Maybe too close.  She can always tell when I\'m lying or when I feel guilty or I\'m upset.  She relies on me a lot.  For companionship and support.   I always look to her for advice. She was crying and didn\'t know what to do.  She felt so alone.  And I could feel everything that she was feeling.  MY father was being insensitive and her face was all red and her eyes were full of tears.  I didn\'t know what to do.  I felt helpless and cold.  I tried to comfort her but wasn\'t doing a very good job at it.  She had always been there to comfort me when I needed it but now It was my turn and I didn\'t know what to do.  I felt a pain so deep in mt heart it is unexplainable.My older brother had been bothering me continuously and I finally lost control and hit him on the head with my Jordache purse,(Of course containing the essential make-up, hair berretes, and candy), and then he started to cry.   My Father walked into the room to see what was going on. He saw my brother crying and automatically looked over at me and started chasing me around the house.  I have never felt so much fear in all my life.   I actually thought he was going to kill me.  His face was beet-red and I could see the nerves straining in his neck.  My mother kept trying to get in the way to stop him from getting to me.  I think she was even more frightened than I was.  I ran out the front door and went over to my nextdoor neighbor\'s house and played it off like my brother was chasing me and how I was trying to hide from him.  I stayed there until I saw my father leave for work for the evening.  I can still feel that fear now when I think about it.We are pretty close except for not being able to talk comfortably about personal topics.  He looks up to me alot because of my ediucation.It  was about 1AM and we were sitting on my bed ,her in her nightgown and the smell of vasiline drifting from her hands (her essential moisturizing ingredient).  We were talking about boys and my friends and school and laughing and joking.  It was like she was my best friend not my mother.  I think, no, I know I am her best fiend and she looks up to me a lot.  I think it has a lot to do with being educated.  She is so happy that I am getting some sort of education because she always loved school, but being the oldest of 5 brothers and sisters from a poor family, she never made it past sixth grade.  All of her family is in another a country.  I am the only one she can trust.  She makes me feel very important, like everything that I say counts and like she really has greay trust in  me.  We were just like two high school girls talking.',4,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,2.59,0,7.76,2.59,0,7.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.17,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,19.4,0,2.59,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.17,Female37
' At the time, our family did not own a VCR.  This was only a little over 3 years ago so probably 95\% of all families had one at the time but our family never had a lot of money so we didn\'t.  We had rented one to watch a specific tape for a certain occasion.  My father told a very close friend of the family\'s, who didn\'t know that we didn\'t have one, that he had to go rent one.  These people that he told are pretty well off financially so they were surprised that we, unlike most people, didn\'t own one already.  My mother and I were so embarrassed and so mad at him so the three of us got into an argument, mainly between he and I, and I started cursing at him so he started cursing back at me.  I finally said something that really made him mad so he came at me like he was going to try to hit me and I was ready to fight him if he did but mom stopped him.  My mom stayed at home with me when I was little instead of getting a job so we used to always play school in the daytime.  I had a little red rocking chair that we pulled up to the piano bench that I used for my desk.  She\'d play school with me every day.  I didn\'t go to kindergarten so by the time I got to first grade I was way ahead of the other children because my mom had taught me more than the teachers in the schools had been teaching the kids.Our relationship isn\'t the best.  When I lived at home we fought all the time (mostly about money).  Now that I\'ve come to college we get along pretty well since we don\'t see or talk to each other much.  There are still money problems but  mom is dealing with it by herself now.  I feel bad about that.  As long as dad and I aren\'t talking about anything that involves money we get along pretty well.  I love him but we definitely have some differences that clash.  I never really  had much respect for him  because he let his family take advantage of him and they benefit more financially from the family business because he won\'t stand up for what\'s his. I can\'t point out any one incident she\'s always been very involved in all of my school activities and anything I \'ve ever been involved in.  She\'s always helped me with schoolwork or anything I ever  did concerning church or my music.  She\'s never missed a Band Concert or Contest or any other kind of perfomances.        My high school graduation was one of the most postitive memories because I could tell by the look on her face that she was proud of me but sad that I would be going away to college soon. My mom and I have always been extremely close.  I love her more than anyone.  She has always had to take care of my older brother and I and demand that our father come up with the money to get us the things we needed when we lived at home.  I feel I can talk to her about anything and everything I do.  She\'s sacrificed a lot to make sure we got what we needed and she still does.  She would do anything in the world for me and I would do the same for her.  She\'s the greatest!When I was about  3 or 4 years old he would come home for lunch and after we ate he would take me a couple of blocks away, just outside the city limits, to ride by this lady\'s barn so I could see the horses.  It was a quick trip because he had to go back to work but I would get upset on the days he didn\'t have time to take me.',4,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.91,0,0,5.91,0,2.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.48,0,0,0,2.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.63,0,0,2.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.95,0,1.48,13.3,0,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.48,Female37

'The most negative memory I have of my dad was when my mother had left him and took us with her.  We were staying with her  brother and sister -in- law.   He called one time  and spoke to my sister and I.   He sounded really sad and he told me he loved me and that I would be home soon.  I felt like crying.The earliest memory I have of my father is him walking in the door from work and my sister and I runnig toward him in our pajamas yelling \"Good Evening.\"  We would stop everything we were doing and run.  Then he would pick us up one at a time and swing us around.  We would kiss him on his cheek and it would be rough when he needed a shave.    I would be happy  to see him and happy to go finish what I was doing.I choose four because I really don\'t know how the relationship with my father would have been.  At the time of his death he and my mother was once again seperated.  Although we lived in the apartment building around the corner ,  things were a little  strained.  I do know I loved him a great deal and wish I had told him more often.   The most positive memory of my father takes place in the summer time.    We were still living in New York and since it was summer everyone was on the block.   We all would be playing and we would see his big orange delivery truck pull up in front of the building.   All the kids would jump up and down .   He would be smiling as he got out of the truck and I would be smiling because it was my father and not theirs.  I would run and give a hug  and  my sister would too.   The other kids, many of whom did not have fathers present,  would just gather around.The most negative image of my mother  was watching her stagger up the driveway  drunk.  It was real late.  Whoever gave us a ride home  let us out far from the door and she begin stumbling over rocks and things she wouldn\'t normally would have.   I felt ashamed and angry because this wasn\'t the first or last time she would be like this.  If she would have fell over and died right then I probably wouldn\'t had cried.The relationship betwwn my mother and I has gotten better over the years.  After my father\'s death she  moved my younger sister and I south.  A decision I am just beginning to understand and lose some of my resentment towards.   At one time I admitted to hating her.  I blamed her for alot of problems we were having because she was not strong enough  to deal with the problems.   Now instead of her dwelling on her downfalls I try  to use them to improve myself .     I admire her  stregnth to try to send to children to college on one income.   There are still plenty of times when I can\'t stand her  but  I always try to understand what she is going through.  She is a very sensitve person who at times I feel cares to much what other people think.  I also feel that she depends on other people too much.   I try to understand why and deal with her on the same level.  As I get older I understand more of what she says or has been saying to me.  I don\'t always agree, but that\'s life and I love her and found respect for   her.',4,-5,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.6,0,0,4.95,0,3.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.3,0,0,0,0,13.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.3,0,0,0,0,0,9.9,24.75,0,0,0,0,4.95,3.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.9,Female37
'The negative memory of my father that comes to mind, is when he almost hit me.  My father has never hit me, but when I was about thirteen we had it out.  Dad is the type of guy who has the longest fuse ever imagined, but when it ends one better watch out.  At that time, my brother was in the hospital with cancer and my mom was either with him or in the hospital with a slipped disk.  I was feeling neglected and did not want anything to do with my family.  I had threatened to run away, had yelled at my dad, and thrown temper tantrums that were unbelievable.  This had gone on for weeks.  Finally, Dad had it and went to strike back after I had hit him.  He caught himself and left the room.I have worked for my dad for about a year and a half, so I have had the chance to witness many aspects of my dad I haven\'t seen before.  We have grown closer in this respect and been able to understand each other more.The most positive memory of my mother is from the times we lived in Charlotte, NC.  Charlotte was her home, the place she was born and raised.  Her most intimate friendships and memories had been formed there.  My mom was always happy in Charlotte.  It was during those first eleven years of my life that I remember mom at her best.  She loved to smile and laugh, to enjoy life for what it was.  There were always parties and dinners to attend or have.  There were always cookies, cakes, breads, meals to be made.  We attended church frequently, religiously, because it was her church friends and support, love, that made her the happiest.  Life with mom was happy and cheerful during those years.  She raised my three brothers and I with a smile and ease when we lived in Charlotte.  There are two early memories of my mom that I remember the most; I don\'t know which came first.  One was in a mother-daughter group in chuch.  The daughters were the ones giving some type of show, I don\'t remember the details.  What is most prominent in the memory is that she made a yellow dress for me, curled my hair, and smiled in approval.  I know I was very young because the dress is for a three or four year old.         The other memory is from preschool.  I remember her picking me up when I didn\'t feel well.  She took me home, layed me on the couch.  Then she heated a delicious bowl of Campbell\'s Vegetable Soup and made toast.      The most positive memory of my father is also from Charlotte.  When my mom went back to work, Dad had to care for us on the weekends.  Those weekends were filled with activity.  Dad would take my brothers and I to Freedom park to play, soccer games, baseball games, and run around Discovery Place.  When it snowed in Charlotte, we had our winter wonderland decorated by igloos or snowmen resembling Dark Vader, or some other character.  Dad loved to play.  I think after all those hours in the office, he had no desire to be an adult on the weekends.  Dad has yet to change, the only thing that has changed is the games we play are more adult now-golf has become a second religion for my dad and brothers.',4,-4,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.91,0,0,6.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,1.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.73,34.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.82,Female37
'The most negative memory of my father was when I was about one and a half.  I was addicted to my bottle.  If I did not have my bottle at night , I would cry until it was given to me.  This was alright until my dad starting working second shift at his job.  I remember throwing my bottle on the floor late one night and then I cried to wake someone up.  My father could not take this anymore, I guess.  He was fussing at me and then he threw my bottle in the trash can and told me I better not touch it.  He told me I better go to sleep or else.  This scared me so bad, I don\'t even like milk to this day.My earliest memory of my mother was maybe before I  turned one years old.  I remember  her so vividly, driving me to my grandparents\' house.  I  use to spend much time with my grandparents.  I remember riding down HWY 301 in a car.   We would always stop at this country store to get me candy.   After arriving my mom and I would sit on my grandparents swing and she would read to me.  I can remember the birds, cows, pigs, and  chickens on the farm.  I felt much love, interest, closeness, enjoyment, and happiness.The most negative memory of my mother was when I was about three.  By this time I had grown attached to my grandparents.  I wanted to stay with them all of the time.  I would throw temper tantrums all  over the place when it was  time for me to leave.  My mother would get so mad at me.  One time she threatened to hit me if I did not get myself together.  Just like a child, I cried even harder.  She punished me by spanking me.  She did not hit me that many times because my grandfather would not allow anyone to hit me.',3,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.16,0,0,0,6.15,0,0,3.08,0,9.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.08,18.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.15,Female37

'The most negative memory I have on my mother  is we ( me, my mom , and my younger brother) lived together.  One night they were having some meeting at my high school that I thought she should go to.  My mom was in a depression at the time and I knew I would have to give her much encouragement to go.  So I did, and  she went.  I got a call and was invited to go out to dinner with a guy.  So, I did.  When I got home, mom was waiting on the couch.  She was furious.  She thought that I only was strenghening her so that I could go out on a school night.  But that was not the truth.  My mother felt very insecure at the meeting and then came home to feel betrayed by  her daughter.  When I got home  she started hitting me.  I knew it hurt her to hit me but she was so mad she did.  It didn\'t really hurt me but it did my pride.  I felt horrible and thought I would only deepened her depression. We had just moved to North Carolina about 6 months ago.  We went to my first gymnastics meet.  It was very exciting for me but what made it so great was the look on my moms face after I finished my routines.  She would smile so big.  It would make me feel so good inside.  She was so proud and I was glad I could make her happy. My father became angry for some reason which I thought was unimportant.  He got so mad he hit my step mother and made her cry.  This was not a little love pat.  He had an awful look in his eyes and wanted to hurt her.Being close to my mother\'s age she understands what I am going through.  When we moved she went through a depression and desperately needed a friend.  I stepped in to be that friend.  We get along extremely well.  I can and do tell her everything.  She is one of my closest friends.   I did not live with my father.  The earliest memories I have were him calling on the telephone and say he wanted to spend the weekend with me.  I would run and pack my clothes and sit outside by the driveway and wait for him to come.   I was always so excited  to see him.  A majority of the times he did not show up.  My mother anticipated this so she would always encourage me not to get my hopes up or she wouldn\'t even tell me he  was supposed to show.  When he did come we would always eat pizza and rent movies.  He thought he could buy back the lost time.   I remember  sitting down on her bed with my little brother.  We would be scared of something.  We would get under the covers because it was cold in the winters in Ohio.    Mom would get out he guitar and would play songs and we would sing along until we fell asleep. We have had bad times and I spent little of my childhood with my father.  He now has realized this and regrets it .  He  knows that I am unwilling to forget the times he hurt me, but I am willing to forgive.

'Dad and I have always had a good relationship, not like my mother and I and that is probably because I will always be daddy\'s little girl.  I guess dad was just always positive in the respect as he gave me a good reference point, someone I always looked for for guidence, kind of like my life saver if I was drowning and I needed it .  I would say the most memorable experience was when dad took me to buy my first softball glove.  More than anything else in the world I wanted to play softball.  Dad took me to the store and found the glove that fit my hand, and then he took me home and showed me how to put oil on it and soften it.  He taught me to play catch and he taught me how to stick with it.  I wanted to quit the team my first year because I wasn\'t very good, but helped me and by the end of that season I got my first trophy, Most Improved Player.  I was so proud of that trophy.I think the earliest memory of my father was one day going with my mom to meet him after work.  I think he had to work late, I don\'t quite remember.  We went to meet him and we were waiting by the ice cream maching for him to come see us.  When dad got there he bought me a Heath bar ice cream.  For the longest time I was convinced that my father went to work to make ice cream bars and made money to buy cookies with.  After that I loved to visit my father at the office, he always  bought me ice cream.  Sometimes he would let me push buttons on his computer and that made the visit even better. Dad and I have a good relationship, we will always have a father-daughter relationship.  He is just very protective because I am his only little girl.  He only wants the very best for me and that is why  he is the way he is.I probably remember the earliest thing as learning to read from my mother.  I was sitting at the kitchen table and I had my new Sweet Pickles books that had arrived in the mail, and I was so anxious to read them, but I couldn\'t.  I begged my mother to read them to me.  I remember my mother was cooking something at the time, what I don\'t know.   She must have finished cooking and then I remember she took my books and sat with me at the table and read them to me.    I really liked those books I remember.I don\'t know if the negative experience with my father is just one.  I guess the car trip to vacation is the negative experience I have with my father.  He hates to take anymore time than absolutely necessary to get to a destination.  He is always so tense.   Well, my mother is not very good at reading a map, so as a little kid I got stuck with the job.  He would get so angry if I couldn\'t tell him where we were going.  I learned how to read a map pretty well pretty quickly.  Dad, in that respect, always scared me.  He could just look at me in the wrong way and I would cry.  Now I don\'t know why.  I guess just because he was my dad.  Now that I have gotten older I have just learned to yell back.   Dad is finally realizing that not everything in this world is going to be perfect.There is really no one particular experience that sticks out in my mind.  My mother and I have a really great relationship.  Outside of a few minor  disagreements most of my experiences have been positive.  We are more like best friends than mother and daughter.  She has always enouraged me and been a great role model in my life.  I think probably the most vivid memory of encouragement was when I decided to see a doctor about my weight loss problem.  Even though mom hated to admit that I needed help and she hated to watch me go through it , it was probably the best thing she ever did for me by sticking by me and encouraging me.I remember going to the library one night with my friends, actually I found them on the way.  I was only about 8 at the time.  Well, I was supposed to be home be dark and when we got back from the library they invited me to play at their house.  They were my next door neighbours.

' The earliest memory of my father would be when  he was driving me to daycare one morning and we ran out of gas.  Of course there were a lot  of traffic and lots of horns beeping.  I  got scared that  I wouldn\'t be able to get to \"school\" so I started to cry.  I remember him saying that everything was going to be alright and then he pushed the car to a gas station.  I stopped crying and waited for him to return as the car moved closer and closer to the gas station.\t        The most positive memory of my mother would be have to be when we were living in San Diego, CA and my dad had gone garage sale shopping when he returned he had all these pieces of bikes.  He made a bike for my sister, my mom, and himself.  What I mean by  \"made a bike\"  is that  he fixed up three old bikes to ride and look like new.  My dad hadn\'t made me a bike so my mom and I went down to K-Mart and she bought me a pink Huffy Dirt Bike (it was a dirt bike for girls).  When we got home my dad put U-shaped handlebars on it, a basket, and a banana seat (those really long seats).  This is a positive memory of both my parents but mostly of my mother because she actually bought me a bike (cost: $75) while everyone else\'s bike was made from an old bike.The most negative memory of  my father would be when one night Dad hadn\'t come home  and still wasn\'t home after my sister and I went to bed.  When he finally came in, we were awakened by my mother\'s yelling and screaming.  He had been to Las Vegas and hadn\'t told anyone where he had gone.  My mother had been worried that something had happened, but he was in Vegas.  She said that it better not be another woman but actually it was a slot machine.  We  are very close.  We began to get closer after my sister went off to college and when we moved to Colorado.  My sister was in school in California and my parents and I were in Colorado.  My mother and I  were each other\'s only real friends in the beginning.  That friendship and closeness continues on through high school and college.  We have fun together and enjoy each others company.  She\'s always  there for me, even though I don\'t always ask for help when needed.  The most negative memory of my mother would have to be  when we lived in San Diego, CA.  I love children and did back then, too.  We lived in a cul-de-sac where a lot of young kids lived, too.  My mother told me many times not to pick up the neighbors\' kids because I might hurt them.  So one day I was outside picking up the children and my sister told me that mom wanted me.  So not really knowing what she wanted, but hoping she didn\'t see me pick up those children.  I went in the house and up the steps.  My mother started asking me questions about picking up the children and then she got our her belt and she popped my bottom and legs with the belt.  I remember looking out the window at the kids playing and  thinking that I was getting a spanking because I was playing with them.',3,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.83,0,0,0,5.12,0,0,0,3.42,0,0,0,3.41,0,0,1.71,0,15.37,0,1.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.43,0,0,5.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.83,17.06,0,6.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.53,Female37

'My parents divorced when I was 13 and I lived primarily with my mother.  When my parents first got divorced she was very depressed. she\'s had a rather horrid life, and many people told me to take care of her.  So now we are very close, in fact, too much so.  I love her very much but it\'s taking a lot of therapy to develop a normal mother daughter relationship with her.  I love her very much and think the world of her.  She is an absolutely wonderful person.When I was five we just got a new puppy that I absolutely adored.  However, because I was only five and therefore didn\'t know how to handle a puppy, I was rather mean to it.  I would make it flip over and do cartwheels and somersaults and hold it and not let it go no matter how hard it tried.  Well, one night she actually came with me and wanted to sleep in my bed which astounded me because as you can imagine she didn\'t like to do much with me.  I was so happy and then dad  came in and took her away saying she needed to go to the bathroom before everybody went to bed.  I didn\'t understand this so I became enraged.  I yelled,\"Daddy!\" to make sure he wasn\'t anywhere around and he didn\'t answer.  So at the top of my lungs I screamed,\"you stupid daddy\"  and he evidently heard me and came in and spanked me.About a year after my parents got divorced, my father started dating again (he ultimately wanted my mother back but she wouldn\'t take him) and that was fine until he proposed to her.  They broke up for several months and then got back together and then they remarried, and I had a hard time with that so it ended in a big  explosion and I didn\'t talk to him for a couple months.  Now we eat dinner together every Wednesday night to just sort of touch base and we get along great.  I love him very much, also.  He would do anything for me.Probably I felt the most positively about my mother when she would pick me up from daycare or first grade.  She was  such a great person to see, she was always so happy to see me and gave me big hugs and kisses like I was really appreciated and at that time,  that made me feel really secure.One night my mother and my father were fighting and I was in the shower.  When I got out I heard them screaming at each other and my father was packing his suitcase to leave,  and my mom kept badgering him saying, \"talk to me, Dammit talk to me\"  and my dad said,\" I\'m tired of talking with you, you aren\'t listening to what I\'m saying.\"  So I was in the bathroom crying because I just wanted mom to leave dad alone because he was furious and I was scared he was going to hurt her or  himself  (although he\'d never done it before, but then again, I\'d never seen him that mad before).  So I ran to my room crying and mom said,\"look,   See what you\'ve done to her! \"  And I was like,\"no  mom, you\'re the one making me upset!\"  And if I could\'ve said anything to her at that time I would screamed to her \"Leave him alone before he leaves us for good!\"',5,-5,0.5,1,5,0,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,10.05,3.35,0,3.35,0,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,0,0,0,3.35,0,0,0,6.71,0,0,0,1.68,0,0,1.68,0,21.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.57,0,0,3.35,0,0,0,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.38,21.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.35,0,0,6.7,Female37
'My most negative memory of my mother was the time she found out  I wasn\'t a virgin.  She was really mad and screamed at me.  I thought she was out of touch with how the world is today.  I thought she should be getting mad at my older sister because she told my mom I wasn\'t a virgin to get herself out of trouble.  It worked because mom forgot about yelling at her and started yelling at me and started to cry.  I felt really bad that  I\'d made her cry.The earliest memory of  my father is him bringing me and my two sisters Chicken McNuggets  for dinner while we were visiting him while he and mom were separated.  He had a real small apartment with not a lot of  furniture and our bed was just a mattress on the floor that all three of us had to share.  He left us alone and went out with some girl who looked a lot older than him.The most negaative memory of  my  father was when he and Mom were separated and he came to our farmhouse after school one day to talk to Mom.  She wasn\'t there and he got real mad.  My older sister got a ladder and put me and my little sister up on the roof of the shed where he couldn\'t find us.  She went to go talk to him, but he  was real drunk and hit her real hard.  She was only ten at the time, but he threw her on the ground and stomped on her with his combat boots using all these bad words.  My little sister got real scared and wanted to help her, but I wouldn\'t let her go because she was only five and he might hurt her too.  My Mom\'s boyfriend (my future step-father) showed up to check on us and he hit my father really hard and made him go away. The most positive memory of my mother is June 18, 1983.  That was the day she married my step-father.  I was a bridesmaid in her wedding.  She held it at an old colonial house in a state park.  She looked so happy and young.  Her dress made her look  20 again but much prettier because she was with my step-father not her first husband. My mother is very strong and has been through a lot and I hope to be as strong as she is when I \'m  an adult.

'My father  lost his job three years ago and hasn\'t been able to find one since.  This event has put an enormous amount of strain on the family which leads to all types of family problems.  Most of the problems have been financial and now he is in Maryland desperately  seeking a job within his field.  I think that my father is a very intelligent man, but he has experienced what I refer to as southern racial discrimination.  We are originally from Rochester, New York and there he was the city manager.  \tI have seen my father at his happiest as well as his saddest moments.  It hurts me to know that he is as unhappy as he is.  He feels too over qualified to settle for any job that he doesn\'t think fits his calibre.  It also hurts him deeply to put all of the financial weight on my mother.  My mother has a great job and is doing well on her own but we need two incomes within our family  and my father feels that he should be the man of the house. My mother is a very sweet person and she always sacrifices things for herself in order to be certain that everyone else is happy.  I have several memories but one that sticks out the most right now is when she gave one of my best friend\'s mother $100.  Although this may be a small sum, the ironic part is that she did not know my friend\'s mother.  She barely knew my friend and what she knew about her was all negative because my friend was a runaway child.  My mother felt that she was a bad influence on me but she was still willing to help her mother.

He would tell me funny stories about when he was little and on the farm;  he always made me laugh.  The most negative memory of my father was when my mother and my sister got into a fight and Dad just happened to be home at the time.  My sister was going through what I guess I could call a sort of identity crisis at the time.  Or maybe she was just trying to break away and become her own person.  She was a cheerleader and the editor of the high school yearbook, and so she would stay out late at night and go to a lot of parties, sometimes without telling my mother when she would be home or where she was going.  She\'d come back drunk a few times, or early in the morning, sneaking in before anyone found out that she had been gone all night.  I don\'t remember what caused the fight between she and my mother anymore.  But they were yelling at each really loud, and when Mom told my (elder) sister to go to her room and my sis refused, I guess Dad decided that he finally had had enough.  I was sitting on the couch in the living room, I believe, and Dad got off of his chair and the next thing I knew he was trying to force my sister into her room, and she was bracing herself against the doorframe with both arms and legs.  The way her arms were starting to bend, I was starting to get worried that my dad was going to break her arms.  I remember being torn -- should I go help my sister?  Dad looked as though he was hurting her.  And yet, some part of me felt that it was her own fault.  All she had to do was go into the room.  Why was she making things so hard on herself?I love my father.  We are not very close, but I don\'t take offense to the things he says, and I can honestly say that I am usually happy when I get to spend time with him.The most negative memory of my mother.  This one is hard.  I suppose that I\'d have to choose an episode from far in my past, while I was still in grade school.  My mother is very strict and is Japanese, so certain things, such as stealing or lying make her more furious than I suppose \"normal\" parents would become.  My mother and I were over at our friend\'s house.  They were getting ready to move out of their home, and they had told me that I could have the books that I wanted; all I had to do was come and get them.  So my mother and I went over there.  I sat in the living room and put the books in brown paper bags.  They (our friends who were moving) had a glass jar in which they would always put candy bars and the like, you know, the little mini ones that they would always hand out to kids at Halloween.  Anyway, I stared at those candy bars for a long time, and I tried to make myself ask if I could have one of them, but I was always shy, and my mother was forever telling me how fat I was, and so I was too embarrased to ask if I could have one.  I knew that they would have said, yes, of course I could have one, but I was too embarrassed.   At any rate, I took one of the miniature candy bars without asking and put it in the bottom of one of the brown paper bags.  We were getting ready to put books in the bags when Mom discovered the candy bar.  Of course she asked me if I knew how it had gotten there, and, acting as a typical child afraid of being punished, I said, at first, no, I didn\'t know how it had gotten there.  But then she looked at me in that way that mother\'s have, and so I told her the truth.  She hit me till I fell to the ground on my knees, all the while screaming how she was so embarrassed to call me her child, and how could I steal from our friends, and just other things that I can\'t really recall anymore.  She made me crawl to the lady of the house on my knees and beg for forgiveness.  I still remember how Mrs X was so concerned and telling me that it was alright and to get up, but my mother dragged me down to the floor by my ear and made me crawl over to her.  I hated her for that.I have hated my mother with an intenseness that has left my sister totally without understanding for at least 6 and a half years now.  Lately, since I\'ve moved out of the house, things have gotten a little better, but I still don\'t really enjoy being around her for very long.  I am very sensitive and rather shy around her, things which she cannot abide.  She nags forever (for at least two hours) over the smallest of things until even my stepfather can\'t handle it.  She has a very sharp and short temper, and is very quick to strike and hit me.  I never feel as though I could do anything that would entirely please her.  I still remember bringing home 98\'s when I was in 1st or 2nd grade and being told that if I had only studied for 10 more min, I could have gotten a hundred.  She is very quick to criticize me, and is forever talking about me and complaining about me behind my back, just as she does to my sister.  She had always had me under her thumb, and when I started dating my recent boyfriend and decided that I had the right to stand up for myself and actually express my feelings, she told me that he was a bad influence on me and that he couldn\'t call me or come over to the house anymore.  Okay, so maybe I was a bit extreme in the way I burst loose all of the emotions and resentments that I had always held inside, but when you compare nothing with anything at all, the difference it rather noticeable, wouldn\'t you say?I\'m not too sure.  I don\'t know which one comes first, so I\'ll just guess.  I had cut my finger doing who knows what, and my mother (who was busy cooking dinner for the family at the time) told me to go to the bathroom and put some medicine on it.  Now, I don\'t know the name of the medicine anymore, but it is orangy-red in color and basically anything it touches it stained for life (except for your skin).  I knew that I would get into trouble if I spilled it, and I also knew that I was likely to spill it, so I asked her to help me.  She told me that she was busy, so go do it myself.  I walked to the bathroom and put the medicine on my cut, and sure enough, I spilled some on the bathroom counter.  I tried to wipe the drop up immediately, but all I did was managed to smear it and make the stain appear larger, though perhaps it wasn\'t as dark.  I went back out to the kitchen and told Mom what happened.  She went back to the bathroom and saw what I had done, and proceeded to either yell at me or hit me, I don\'t recall which anymore.  I ran out into the living room where my dad was watching the news and reading the newspaper in hope of getting some kind of protection from mom.  I told him what happened, and he got mad at Mom for yelling at me when I had asked her for help, knowing that I would be likely to spill it.  Mom and Dad got into a fight, and I think that I ended up in my room.  I don\'t recall anymore.The most positive memory of my mother that I can remember isn\'t really much of a memory at all.  Rather, it is a vague feeling that we finally weren\'t fighting and I had this feeling that she was just trying to look out for me and protect me as best as she could.  I was very hesitant about talking to her, but I told her that I was going to Florida to see my boyfriend (of whom she doesn\'t really seem to approve), and she didn\'t yell or forbid me to go, as I was half expecting.  Instead, she told me that she didn\'t approve of my boyfriend and I starting a physical relationship.  We were sitting in Applebee\'s at the time, and our dinner had not yet come, but I told her of my plans very excitedly and with a rather large smile on my face, which is unusual for me.  Perhaps that is what kept her from yelling.  Or maybe she was realizing that I wasn\'t going to take no for an answer this time.

'um.  my earliest memory. tough question.  i think it was when i was about 3, in san diego. in SD there are these little bitty ants, smaller than the ones here.  i was a little kid (maybe i was 2, ja, the summer after i turned 2, i\'d only just learned to walk well) and i was playing in our backyard in shorts and i stepped on an anthill.  as i remember it hundreds of these tiny little ant buggers were crawling all over my bare legs, and all i could do was stand there and scream  (hell, i was only 2).  my mum came outside to see what was the matter, and my legs were black from the knees down with these little bitty ants, and she took me inside and washed them off me and made me feel better. still have this massive phobia of little bitty evil ants, though.i was hoping we\'d just stick with questions about my mum, okay.  i guess my earliest is again in san diego, before my little sister was born, so i was 3.  my dad and i used to share submarine sandwiches from some little restaurant in Coronado.  he\'d get them, bring them home, and i\'d sit on the counter in the kitchen and we\'d each start at one end of the sub and race to the middle.  i always thought we\'d gotten to the very middle at the same time.well, i think pretty much all i can say is we\'re working on it.  we\'re both very stubborn and that isn\'t usually conducive to getting on well.  i learned the vast majority of my value system from my father, and i respect him more than any one else in the world (except, of course, my mum).but he has said before that he doesn\'t respect me, and that makes it difficult.  i think to him i\'m still either a little girl or an out of control teenager, and in ways to me he\'s still an extremely scary person.  he\'s the only person in the world who can make me cry.as i stated earlier, my mum and i are pretty much best friends.  we fight occasionally, but after our fights we make up very quickly.  our personalities and ideas are very similar, and we do have a lot of fun together.  i respect her a great deal, more than anyone else except my father, whom i respect as much as her.um.  no fair.  i don\'t think i can do this one.  damn..damn.  okay.  no detail, though.  i made a feeble attempt on my own life at age 14, i don\'t know, just a goofy kid with problems i guess. anyway, i got scared and told my parents about  it. they yelled at me (do you blame them?) i remember my dad asking me if \"that was the trendy thing to do?\"  i never forgot those words, although i see now that he was just scared himself and not knowing exactly how to deal with something like that.',3,-5,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.71,0,13.49,0,1.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.93,25.05,0,1.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.71,Female37
'The most negative memory of my father was when we went court to see if he could get custody of me so I could stay with him.  Things did not work out right and I wanted to stay with my mother .  He was very upset with me and he still holds a grudge against me to this day.  My mother and I never get along because she always has to see things her way.  She always compares me to her in school.  I always have to live and overcome her goals that she has set for me.  We never agree on anything.  She hates the guys I date and she hates the clothes I wear.  I get real frustrated with her because I can never please her in anything I do.  She doesn\'t communicate with me, she just argues.  I feel alone in college because she does not tell me that she loves me anymore and she doesn\'t act like she cares.The most negative memory about my mother is, when she punished me for something I did not do and I got grounded for it.

'The most positive memory of my mother was probably the first time we ever communicated on an adult to adult level. i was visiting her at her house in Asheville and my brothers were with Dad.  She and I had a nice dinner at home and a bottle of wine. We were sitting beside the fire and started talking about the past , the future , our mistakes and our successes. Rather than offering unwanted advice, Mom listened to me and told me about her similar experiences .   It was one of the most  satisfying ,content , safe feelings I\'ve eever had. I knew then that my mom was the best friend I\'d ever have. We were    playing softball  in high school   against a rival  team . It was one of the biggest games   of the season and I didn\'t think Dad was going to be able to come.  He came to almost all my games  so I was a little disappointed.

'The most positive memory of my mother is that she is always willing to help people.  Homeless, sick, hungry, she will pull a drunk off the street, feed him, let him sleep on the floor, and give him clothes to wear, if there is anything around that he can wear.  At our house on Thanksgiving and Christmas, it doesn\'t matter who shows up at the door, they are welcomed to come in and sit down.  My mother has always been that type of person.  I can also remember when we were growing up and needed things such as shoes and clothing for school and church.  She would always see that we got the things we needed, even if it meant fussing with my father for hours.   My mother has always been a cheerful, happy person.  She is always the life of any party.  She has always shown love towards not only her children, but strangers as well.The most negative memory of my father is when once he came home and had been drinking and I had fixed dinner and he was crying at the dinner table.  He was crying, he said, \"because he wanted us to be like other children.\"  Meaning, that he and my mother was separated and he wanted us to be a family.  My father always drank as long as I can remember.  In fact, he died from results of alcoholism.  The most positive memory of my father was when he would kid with us as children.  I remember when we used to ask my father for money and he would end the request with a rhyme.  For example, we might say,  daddy, give me a nickle.  And he would say, \"say you\'re tickle.\"  We would be serious, but would end up going  away without the money, laughing.  I remember that he always saw that we had enough food on the table.  We had beans, bread and peanut butter if there was nothing else.   He was a comical guy.When I was twelve years old my mother and father separated for the final time.  They had separated several times before, but when I was twelve years old, they separated for good.  My mother caught a bus to Raleigh, NC.  We lived in the country and did not have a bus station.  So, we had to \"flag\" the bus down beside the highway.  Highway 301 was the main highway before I95 was completed and our house was right beside the road.  \tI remember that I had a play at school the next day and I needed my hair done.  My mother was the only one that did my hair because I was \"tender-headed.\"   \t\tMy mother and father had just had a fight and I can\'t remember whether he threw her out or she just decided to leave on her own.  I remember that I stood beside the road and waited with her and tried to talk her out of leaving.  She took two of my youngest sisters with her.  \tI remember that I cried myself to sleep that night and was very unhappy at school the next day, even though I had a part in the school play.  I did do my speech, I remember that we had to recite the 23rd Psalm.  \tI hated my mom for a long time for leaving us the way she did.  When I was older and thought I understood, I forgave her.  I love my mother very much, but we have never been as close as some of my other eleven sisters and brother.I think my mother tries too hard to please all of her children at the same time.   It is always tension when we are all in the house at the same time.

'We have a wonderful relationship.  We\'ve been through rough times but now it\'s just nice.  I can talk to her about whatever and am not ashamed of it.  I\'m sure there are some things I don\'t tell her, but very little.  She\'s a great friend that I can trust.  I can\'t say that I really \"look up\" to her, and there are many times I\'ve said I do not want to be like her in some of her ways.  I don\'t call her mom, I call her Bren.  She loves it.  It\'s a more casual relationship.That is a very difficult question.  I remember so much about my father, moreso than my mom.  My dad was always a wonderful, \"do for the kids\" father.  He used to let me drive the car around the neighborhood sitting on his lap.   He tells me that\'s why I\'m such a good driver now.  Not really, I actually scare him to death when I drive.  He says I\'m TOO comfortable with the road and other drivers.  It\'s all because of him!There\'s not too many, but the ones that I do have are pretty bad.  I guess the one that hurt the most (other than not taking my father back for the third time) would have to deal with my stepfather.  God, she fell for him hard, would do anything for him, and kinda tossed the kids to the side to do whatever made him happy.  Pissed me off!Well, I have to say that was when my father started an affair with Cindy and became an alcoholic.  Very sad, the perfect little family being torn apart.  Anyway,  it was one night when my dad came home very, very drunk and I heard my parents yelling downstairs, so I snuck around the corner to hear exactly what was being said.  He was just cursing my mother F__K this and F__K that.  All I know is that was NOT my dad talking.  I mean it was, but I just couldn\'t believe it.  Alcohol can do some strange things to people.

' We\'ve been through good times and bad times; it mostly depends on how much time we spend together.  I get tired of her pretty easily.  She doesn\'t understand the way I think as  easily because she is real uptight.  Everything needs to be perfect.  She tries real hard to please me, but sometimes that\'s not what I want to hear.  I want her to be her own woman and not be so dependent on dad.  We never fought, but somtimes I think that\'s not real good.

There was one year when I saw her after every class.  Then at home all she would talk about is school. We drove to school together and she would act like she was miss popular, like she knew everyone, making me feel like I knew no one.  She knew all my teachers and would talk to them about me and find out my grades.  I couldn\'t stand to be in the same room with her.  Her voice bothered me.

'The most positive memory of my mother is when as I was growing up as a young child, she would always entertain us kids.  There are 3 of us, and everyday was our day.  We did everything together.  Color, play house, walk, swim, everything.  She made time for us as children.I guess that would have to be when I was in Jr High School and some friends and I decided to attend a football game, away from our High School.  Once we got to the game, we then decided not to watch it since we were losing  anyway, we took it upon ourselves to stroll around the neighborhood, an area we knew nothing about. Well before we knew it, game time had come and gone, and we were still out and about.  My friend, Sue\'s dad drove and apparently had been driving all over town looking for us.  He finally found us and was not too pleased with our decision to acquaint ourselves with an unfamiliar neighborhood.   In fact, all the way home he mentioned that over and over again.  Well, by the time we had arrived at Sue\'s house, and I began my block walk home, a quite enjoyable evening had turned sour.  By the time I had gotten home, Sue\'s mother, called my mother, who by the way had card-club (a silly idea in which all the women in the neighborhood get together and, yes, play cards. my mother did enjoy it though).  Anyway, she was not all that pleased when I arrived and she inquired about the game, and I of course said  \"it was fine\" obviously lying, she was somewhat upset.
