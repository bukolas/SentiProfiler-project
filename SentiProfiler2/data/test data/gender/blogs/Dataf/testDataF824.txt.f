Hi my name is Dee I am new to blogging and I hope that I can get use to it sooner than later. I love make up, the art of it and the creativity of it. I am starting this blog so that I can give you reviews on new products and older products also. I am a very fair person and you can be assured that I will be giving you my honest opinion. Also if you have something in mind that you would like me to review let me know and I will try to make it happen.
I will also try to do some step by step tutorials. I will be showing you guys how different thing work and how to store your make up. I hope this works out well and to hear from you guys.
