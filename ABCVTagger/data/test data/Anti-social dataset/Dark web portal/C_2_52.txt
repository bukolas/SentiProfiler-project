RISE (AND FALL)OF THE GRAVE WORSHIPPER MILITIAS IN SOMALIA (part 2) : - They met with the Ethiopians,and America,now over-confident about the militias project ,armed them.The prospect of dollars coming in brought some warlords and tribal leaders into the fold.These murtad militias first rebelled against the mujahideen in Dhusa Marreb,in Galgudud region.As the mujahideen were overstretched,they were forced to retreat.these graveworshippers,ridiculously calling themselves 'Ahle sunna wal jamaca',soon occupied most of Galgudud.At first suffering setbacks,the Shabab mujahideen have now struck back,boosted by a massive rearmament and influx of muhajir mujahideen,and with their new IED bombs,and also helped by a new ally,the Hizb al Islam.Now the mujahideen have again wrested back control of the grave worshipper stronghold of Wabho.The mujahideen already controlled all of Lower and Middle Jubba,Gedo,Bay and Baykool,lower Shabelle regions.Now the mujahideen have taken the fight to Hiraan,middle shabelle and Galgudud,not to mention Mogadishu.
