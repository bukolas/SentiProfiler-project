There are tons of Radar Detectors out on the market these days. The question is: Which one do you buy?
There are cheap ones and expensive ones. There are some things in life that cheaper is better. Radar Detectors are not one of those things! The more you spend the better off you are!
The Valentine One is a state of the art Radar Detector. It can sense radar from the front, back and sides and tell you exactly where it is.
