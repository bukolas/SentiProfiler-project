Recently, I had a conversation with someone about what I'm doing with my life. They said to me, "You know Rebekah, you've never gotten over the 'when I grow up' mentality. Just do something radical." I looked at them questioningly, thinking to myself, Yeah, easier said than done.
But then I got to thinking. I've been mulling over this statement "just do something radical" for over a week now. And last night, something popped into my head that made me stop, and contemplate. What if doing something radical with my life doesn't necessarily mean doing something that's going to change the course of history, or the ways of a culture? What if, in my life, doing something radical simply means to do something with my life I've never thought I was capable of before? What if I'm not meant to change the world, but simply to change my own world, the world I can immediately impact? Does doing something radical have to be a huge gesture that hundreds or thousands will notice, or can it simply be something small, something many other people give no thought to, but something that is a huge step to me?
What if doing something radical means to fulfill the plan God has for me, however simple it may be, even if it's not glamorous or impressive?
