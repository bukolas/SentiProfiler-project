Here how I feel now...
I hurt you much and I know I let you down and dissapointed...it's all my fault
My heart pain because what you said hurt me much. I just like a shadow that stay in darkness and my face only brightens up as I see your smile..
I worry that you might not know my feelings and I get scared that the gap between us would widen..
I hold my breath and bite my lips pray that you would give me one more chance..
Once the music ends, you'll not given me another chance..
I just prayed and prayed that I could bring back the time..I miss you
You, who never understood my feelings..
I despited you so much.. so much, to the point I sometimes would tearing because of you..But now, my eyes are dry
Everynight I would look at myself and wonder how it turned out like this...I would close my eyes then I dream an endless dream...
I prayed that you can give me another chance..can you?
By this time, I wish you will stay happy always and forget me if it hurt you..
So that I can move on..
Please erase me out of your heart if you feel sad..

I've been living this life for too long...we are tired of it..
Yet, I hope once day she would look at me and smile.
And you will be a part of my heart forever..
