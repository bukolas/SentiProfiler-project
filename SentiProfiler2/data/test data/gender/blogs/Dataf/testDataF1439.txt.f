Baby has officially graduated from embryo to fetus and has grown to about 1 inch in length. About the size of a medium green olive. His or her head is continuing to develop and take on more baby-like proportions. This week, tiny muscles are starting to form. This will allow her to move her arms and legs. It will still be awhile before I can feel it though!
