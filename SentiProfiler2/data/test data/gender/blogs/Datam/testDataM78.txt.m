This is my religion !!!

I hail from a country that is known for its multicultural, multi-religious, multi-people diversity. For the people of the west, India is a land of mystery that can only be demystified by the understanding of religion and philosophy. As an Indian I know that we are just another set of people striving hard to improve the way we live and the way people around us think of us. It is true that India has so many religions that it could be incredibly interesting to know about all of them. It’s almost like the rainbow, all colors emerging from the same source and still having such different forms and perceptions. But, things are not always what they look like. From a rainbow, it may have now become an illusion, which is so hard to understand that millions of the ‘followers’ are driven to the limits of insanity while trying to find answers for their souls.
I can’t ask you what religion is. I don’t find myself capable enough and don’t expect you to provide an answer that would end all the miseries that this word has hurled upon us. Now, this is a dangerous thing to say. Religion and misery? But, things are quite like this in most parts of the world. Today we talk about global citizenship and economies expanding beyond the political and cultural boundaries and yet we have people with complete intolerance towards others’ views on something that is such a private affair, religion. I really fail to understand why people choose to comment on the beliefs of other people with very little or no understanding of their lives and/or religion. 
I think that religion is all about making peace with yourself and the ‘community’ that you belong to. So, what happens when this process of making peace with you start to intrude into other lives and their right to a peaceful life? That’s when the clashes start and people like us start to question the whole point of having such a structure like religion to unite people. There are other forms in which segregations can be made and a common peace can be thought of, but the question remains, is it always necessary to segregate the society into sects based on one thing or the other? Like always, I don’t have the answer to this question!
