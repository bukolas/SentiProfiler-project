I'm sure you've heard of extrasensory perception (ESP). Well, what I have is EAP, or extra-allergy perception. When you have allergic-asthma as long as I have, this is a skill you develop. Okay, so I suppose you're wondering what EAP is. Well, it's the ability to know when something around you is one of your allergy triggers. It's the ability to know what places you need to avoid. Actually, it's quite a neat skill. As far as I know, I'm the only person alive with this skill. I'll give you an example. As I enter another person's home, I can "sense" as soon as I walk in if that person has a dog. And I know I need to either get out, or prepare myself for an allergy or asthma attack. As I enter my dad's cabin, for example, I can sense that there are a lot of dust mites and molds, and that I must not stay long. I also get this feeling as I enter certain homes. My EAP is pretty accurate too. For example, when I went to Florida a few years ago, my wife wanted to spend the night at her cousins. Well, as soon as I entered that house I had this feeling I was going to have trouble. I told her I was going to have a rough night. "Oh, you'll be fine. It's all in your head," she said. Voila, at bedtime, my allergies and early warning signs showed their ugly faces. I was puffing on my inhaler all night, and I was tired the entire next day. When I got to my parents home the next day I received no such sensation. I knew I'd be safe during the rest of the vacation.
