Manolo says, it is Thursday, and you are all wound up and ready for the weekend to arrive because, for the first time in months, clement weather has been forecasted by the Channel 11 man of weather, Skip “Stormy” Steele (née Ranulph Grabble).

It has been the long and dreary winter, to say the least, and you are ready for it to be over, and even the slightest hint that Spring (Glorious Spring!!!) is in the offing is enough to send you into the frenzy of plan-making.

“A Picnic!,” you shouted to no one in particular when Stormy Steel announced sunshine and temperatures in the low 60s, “a picnic at the park, with small cucumber sandwiches and cold fried chicken and watermelon and potato salad…maybe red potato salad…and fruit-flavored iced tea…”

Your mind raced with the possibilities of frolicsome summery entertainment, never mind that any watermelon you could find would have been air freighted in from New Zealand and cost more than your first car, the 1968 Saab 96. (It looked like the upside down bathtub, and had 3 and the half on the tree, and the strange freewheeling thingy, and seemed to be designed by people who had heard about cars but had never actually seen one in person).

Time to take the deep breath.

Yes, the first day of spring is nearly here, but unless you live in the more southerly parts of North America (like perhaps Tegucigalpa or Cozumel) the weather is not yet all that. Soon, but not yet.

In the meantime, you know what you need, jelly sandals, like these, the Sunny Jelly Flats from Fendi. Congratulations to the Manolo’s internet friend, the Shannon, for being the first person to correctly identify this flats-wearing personage of note.
