Assalaamu alaykum, Quote: Al-Jamaa al-Salafiya al-Jihadya in Palestine (The Jihadist Salafist Group in Palestine) seeks a Palestinian legal system based purely on the sharia - Islamic law - and accuses Hamas of being too liberal. HAMAS is not "liberal," they are sell-out. Like I said, it is Jund Ansar Allah who is following in the footsteps of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (r.a.). Quote: A spokesperson for the Hamas-run interior ministry dismissed Musas's comments and described him as mentally unstable. They said the same things about Rasool Allah (s.a.w.). When one speaks the truth and you cannot cover yourself up anymore, then you try to defame them. How is the Sheikh unbalanced or insane? Quote: Heavily armed men accompanied Musa as he addressed worshippers at the mosque [AFP] "There has been some criticism that Gaza has become a bastion or a safe place for a lot of foreign fighters ... and that is something that many here, in particular from Hamas, believe undermines Hamas's ability to rule." This is like how what happened in Syria with Sheikh Marwan Hadid (r.a.) in the 1960's.
