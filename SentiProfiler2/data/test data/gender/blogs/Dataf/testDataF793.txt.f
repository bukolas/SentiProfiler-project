I suffered from migraines and neck pain. i went to other MD's and chiro's but Doctor Alexis was the first who could really adjust me and provide therapy and other treatments that made a difference. I have gone 6 months with no migraines! This has been such a blessing-they helped me change my diet, get adjusted, and did AWESOME muscle work. I only had to go like 4 times before i was 100% now i see her probably once a month to prevent further migraines-and it has been successful!!!
