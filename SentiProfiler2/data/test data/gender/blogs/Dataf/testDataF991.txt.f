It was a really wonderful day!!  I slept in until 9am - unheard of for me, but woke feeling well rested.  The kids slept in later, so I had the house to myself this morning :-))  Tea and quiet - so peaceful!  

I was out until 11:30 last night with my girlfriends.  We are planning a weekend away in June for the 55th birthday of my good friend Susan #1.  Susan #2 has a family cabin/house on Big Lagoon in California - so we are going to take a road trip down there and spend 3 days of just "girls" - there will be five of us and it will be so much fun!

Today was a basketball game for the youngest - they won, which was very nice!!  Then the kids went to dad's for the day and I hung out with my buddy Angela.  We went to Walmart for a sewing machine (which they no longer carry), then on to Michael's, then Ikea.  I got all the things I wanted (except the cheap sewing machine).  Then we walked down the block from my house to this little Italian restaurant for dinner.  All in all, a good day - very relaxing!

On the art front not much happened today - I was too busy socializing.  But I did want to show you this sweet little china box made in Occupied Japan, that I found weeks ago.  I just discovered it's a perfect fit for my 52 List for 2010 cards.  Check it out...
Tomorrow I will be staying home all day and playing with my art supplies, so I hope to have something to show you Sunday evening...


all for tonight my lovelies - sweet dreams,


and to all my friends in the Pacific - stay safe - I am thinking of you tonight!!!
