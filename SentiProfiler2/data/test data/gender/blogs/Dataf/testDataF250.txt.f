Unfortunately, the only real relief is anti-inflammatory meds, keeping it elevated and......rest. Anything to keep the wrist from bending too much and putting strain on those soft tissues is beneficial such as a wrist brace. At one point, mine was so bad that I could not hang onto a drinking glass...my hand would just "let go". I did eventually have surgery and it was the best thing I could have done as I was on the verge of nerve damage from all the years with cts. And yes, yard work made it much worse, especially the string trimmer. I also know that being overweight causes the pain/discomfort to increase.
