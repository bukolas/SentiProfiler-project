Vodafone has shuttered Wayfinder  — just 16 months after spending $30 million to acquire the Swedish navigational software firm. The move underscores just how drastically the mobile navigation market has changed in the last year thanks to the emergence of free services from third-party developers. It’s also a sign that U.S. operators won’t be able to continue charging customers extra for navigation for much longer.

Navigation has been a lucrative space for carriers such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint, both of whom continue to offer GPS-based services for $3 a day or $10 a month. Vodafone had acquired Wayfinder in an effort to create a suite of new location-based services and keep pace with third-party developers such as Google and Nokia.

But both Google and Nokia have made their offerings free in the last few months, giving consumers turn-by-turn directions and other goodies for no charge beyond the cost of mobile data. So Vodafone will ditch its effort to develop its own products and look to partner with third parties for location services that it can offer for free. And that’s a clear indication that U.S. carriers looking to monetize their branded navigation services will have to find a way to do it without dinging their customers for additional monthly charges.
Well....shoulder surgery was a success...for the Doctor. He told Christina that "I would be happy I did it.".....Well, I'm still waiting for that joy to overtake me....LOL! It's now been 4 1/2 weeks since the surgery and I'm just now able to do any type of strength exercises. Now don't get too excited for me. The band that I'm using is almost like trying to stretch a small rubber band. It was very depressing to see the difference in my arms when doing rows in front of the mirror. I'm very ansy to get back onto a strict routine, but in the same sense, I want to remain as patient as possible so I don't re-damage my shoulder. 

I have set some fitness goals this year and they include a lot of cycling. I will be doing the Hotter Than Hell 100 Ride in Wichita Falls, TX in August which I feel is a good goal for me with the timing of being able to hit training at the right time. And then after it, I want to do a Sprint Triathlon and possibly a half marathon. The latter two will require me to learn to run distance. I grew up a sprinter and never had to run further than 600 meters other than pre-season which really didn't count. But...that's just part of meeting the goals.

I will be doing a lot of easy upper body and honestly look forward to hitting the One on One Fountain of Youth Yoga.

Christina is hitting P90X hard again which is awesome and I love that she's pressing forward....she's amazing. She has been asked to speak to a group at our church on fitness and P90X/Beachbody products so all is good!

Hope everyone's goals this year are lofty and full of fitness! Please let me know what I can do to help.
The problem with all of these people who are walking out the door at MySpace isn’t so much the number of them, because MySpace is trying to replace them by hiring more people. It’s the fact that the best people are leaving, and taking a lot of the knowledge base with them.

Three star senior employees left to go to cross-town startup Gravity, we reported earlier this week. And tonight we’ve heard that Jeff Webber, the engineering director that oversees the email, instant messaging and other “communications” platforms for MySpace, resigned earlier this week as well to join a startup. He’s been at MySpace for nearly three years and was one of the star engineers and leaders, says one source.

Other recent departures – VP and General Manager of Mobile John Faith, SVP User Experience Katie Geminder and most of her team. And of course CEO Owen Van Natta. And lots more as well, only a few of which we’ve reported.

The company has no direction, says everyone we talk to at MySpace except the top execs, and internal politics are the only thing that seem to matter. Ambitious new projects like Remaking MySpace have been thrown away just because the wrong exec supported it. Anyone who actually wants to build products has left or is looking for a new job, say many, many sources.

If you’re a MySpace employee and feel differently, please contact us anonymously. Because right now all we see is a ton of fluff and absurdity coming from the top, and massive morale problems at the middle management ranks.

The title of this post is actually a recent quote from a (now former) MySpace employee, and it seems to be accurate. They say a company has to hit rock bottom before it can even think about rebuilding into something new. If that’s the case, the time to start rebuilding is, apparently, right about now. But in our opinion MySpace has no chance at all until it is free of the News Corp. death grip.
New research reported this week in the journal Regenerative Medicine points to new directions for creating therapeutic stem cells from adult cells, a technique that has many possibilities for treatment of human diseases. Applying this technique may also lead to treatments directly applying to diseases of aging.

The paper (available here [PDF]) by authors from BioTime Inc., a California research company, demonstrates a new method that helps confirm the telomere hypothesis of cell aging. The telomere hypothesis suggests that a part of the chromosome called a telomere is the “clock” that counts the cell’s age.

One of the problems that has plagued research into so-called “adult” stem cells is that while it’s possible to make therapeutic stem cells from adult cells, these cells “act old.” Unlike embryonic stem cells, they can’t replicate as many times; they die out quickly.

Chromosomes are simply collections of DNA molecules that contain the “genetic code” used to build the proteins that become the body’s tissues. A chromosome is really a sequence of codons, which are like the letters in a coded message, like a teletype message.
What looked like a drizzle last night seems to be turning into a full on downpour. The folks over at BlackBerry Leaks have gotten themselves even more facetime with that mysterious BlackBerry slider device -- and it looks a lot better than we thought. Right now the theories are flying about just exactly what kind of phone this is, with BBL suggesting it might be the next phone in the Storm family, while Kevin over at CrackBerry  has it on good authority that this new handset will be part of the Bold line. Kevin also says that the rumors he's heard on this device call for a 360 x 480 touchscreen display (sans SurePress) and expectations for BlackBerry OS 6.0 to be onboard. The pictured phone apparently has a battery issue which is keeping it from powering up, but hopefully someone will find a way to spark this thing to life and we can get some more solid info. For now, check out one more pic after the break.
American society appears to be undergoing a crisis in trust. Most of the major organizations that we depend upon, including governments of all types, corporations, our health care system, our financial institutions, and our schools all seem to be failing us. Indeed, I do not believe it is an exaggeration to claim that our society is actually undergoing a disintegration process whereby the fundamental premises and values supporting our institutions are all being called into question. While such disintegration is of course very painful to experience, it is also a tremendous opportunity for genuine transformation. My essay will attempt to outline some of the most important values and strategies necessary for the creation of, and the transformation to, high trust organizations.

Higher Purpose

Virtually all of our societal organizations seem to have either forgotten or have never really known why they exist and what their higher purposes are. Instead, they have often elevated narrow individual and institutional self-interest into the only purposes that they recognize as valid. Our governments all too frequently serve the politicians and the public service unions rather than their citizens. Our schools too often serve their educational bureaucracy and teachers' unions instead of their students and their parents. Our health care system too often seeks to maximize the profits of pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies rather than the health and wellness of patients. Many of our corporations primarily exist to maximize the compensation of their executives, and secondarily shareholder value, rather than value creation for customers, employees, and other major stakeholders.

The single most important requirement for the creation of higher levels of trust for any organization is to discover or rediscover the higher purpose of the organization. Why does the organization exist? What is it trying to accomplish? What core values will inspire the organization and create greater trust from all of its stakeholders?

While there are potentially as many different purposes as there are organizations, I believe that great organizations have great purposes. The highest ideals that humans aspire to should be the same ideals that our organizations also have as their highest purposes. These include such timeless ideals as:

The Good: Service to others--improving health, education, communication, and the quality of life. Southwest Airlines, Nordstroms, The Container Store, Amazon.com, and Joie de Vivre Hospitality are examples of this great purpose.

The True: Discovery & furthering human knowledge. Google, Intel, Genentech, and Wikipedia all express this higher aspiration.

The Beautiful: Excellence & the creation of beauty. Apple and Berkshire Hathaway share this ideal in their own unique ways.

The Heroic: Courage to do what is right to change & improve the world. Grameen Bank and the Gates Foundation express this higher purpose in their actions.

Organizations that place these higher purposes at the very core of their business model tend to inspire trust from all of their major stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, suppliers, and the larger communities that they exist in. Higher purpose and shared core values tend to unify the organization behind their fulfillment and usually act to pull the overall organization upwards to a higher degree ethical commitment. Higher levels of trust are a natural result of this unity of purpose, shared core values, and greater ethical commitment.

Conscious Leadership -- Walking the Walk

Next to the power of higher purpose, nothing is more important for creating high levels of organizational trust than the quality and commitment of the leadership at all levels of the organization. It doesn't matter if an organization has a higher purpose if the leadership doesn't understand it and seek to serve it. The various stakeholders of an organization, especially employees and customers, look to the leadership to "walk-the-talk"--to serve the purpose and mission of the organization and to lead by example. It is especially important that the CEO and other senior leadership embody the higher purpose of the organization.

As the co-founder and CEO of Whole Foods Market, I'm the most visible person in the company. One of the most important parts of my job is touring our stores and talking to our team members, customers, and suppliers. I know that in virtually everything that I say and do, our team members are always studying me, trying to determine whether they can trust me and the mission of the company. I'm always on stage. So walking the talk is very important. I try to communicate the mission and values of Whole Foods at every opportunity and I try to live those core values myself with complete fidelity. Fidelity to the mission and values builds trust, while any deviance undermines it. High trust organizations and hypocritical leadership are mutually exclusive.

Teams Everywhere

Human beings evolved in relatively small tribal bands. Many scientific studies have indicated that our ability to maintain close trusting relationships with family, friends, and co-workers is constrained to probably not more than about 150 people. We can, of course, know many more people than this, but it is hard to know them well enough to develop close bonds of trust based on actual experiences. At Whole Foods we recognize the importance of smaller tribal groupings to maximize familiarity and trust. We organize our stores and company into a variety of interlocking teams. Most teams have between 6 and 100 team members and the larger teams are subdivided further into a variety of sub-teams. The leaders of each team are also members of the Store Leadership Team and the Store Team Leaders are members of the Regional Leadership Team. This interlocking team structure continues all the way upwards to the Executive Team at the highest level of the company.

It has been our experience at Whole Foods that trust is optimized in this type of smaller team organizational structure. This is because each person is a vital and important member of their teams. The success of the team is dependent upon the invaluable contributions of everyone on the team. Trust is optimized when it flows between all levels within the organization. Many leaders make the mistake of believing that the key to increasing organizational trust is to somehow get the work force to trust the leadership more. While this is obviously very important, it is equally important that the leadership trust the workforce. To receive trust, it is usually necessary that we give trust. Organizing into small interlocking teams helps ensure that trust will flow in all directions within the organization -- upwards, downwards, within the team, and across teams.

Empowerment = Trust

While small teams are essential to optimizing the flow of organizational trust, equally important is the philosophy of empowerment. The effectiveness of teams is tremendously enhanced when they are fully empowered to do their work and to fulfill the organization's mission and values. Empowerment must be much, much more than a mere slogan, however. It should be within the very DNA of the organization. Empowerment unleashes creativity and innovation and rapidly accelerates the evolution of the organization. Empowered organizations have tremendous competitive advantage because they have tapped into levels of energy and commitment which their competitors usually have difficulty matching.

Nothing holds back empowerment more than the leadership philosophy of command and control. Command and control (C&C) is actually the opposite of empowerment and it greatly lessens trust. C&C usually involves detailed rules and bureaucratic structures to enforce the rules. Such detailed rules almost always inhibit innovation and creativity. People get ahead in the organization not through being innovative, but by following the rules and playing it safe. C&C may produce compliance from the workforce, but it seldom unleashes much energy or passion for the purpose of the organization. Empowerment = Trust. C&C = Lack of Trust.

The Importance Of Transparency and Authentic Communication

A very important measurement and condition of trust is transparency. If we want to optimize trust then we must seek to optimize transparency. When we decide to keep something hidden the motivation is almost always a lack of trust. We are afraid that the information that we wish to hide would cause more harm than good if it were widely known. While of course, some discretion is usually necessary to protect important organizational information from migrating to one's competitors or to outsiders who wish to harm the organization, such discretion can easily be overdone. Transparency is a very important supporting value for empowerment. Indeed, it is difficult for an organization to be empowered if it lacks transparency.

Whole Foods Market strives to optimize transparency to all of our stakeholders. Authentic communication with honesty and integrity are essential attributes of both transparency and trust. This is the exact opposite of what many organizations do, which is to try to "spin" their messaging to tell people what they believe people want to hear so that people will think well of them. This lack of honest, authentic communication and transparency usually boomerangs, however, and undermines trust and creates cynicism. One of the main reasons why Americans don't trust many political leaders, including the various Presidents that have led us, is that we discover that they routinely lie to us. They don't tell us the truth and we come to understand that they don't trust us and feel that they need to manipulate us. We tell the truth to people that we trust.

The high-trust organization takes the risk of revealing too much information. We must be willing to take the risk that some valuable information may fall into the wrong hands because our commitment to empowerment and trust necessitates taking that risk. Creating transparency and authentic communication is an ongoing challenge that every organization faces. We must continually strive to remove the barriers that prevent it, knowing that we can't maintain high levels of organizational trust without it.

Fairness in All Things

Nothing unravels trust more quickly in an organization than either the reality or the perception of unfairness. Another important virtue of creating a culture of transparency is that it helps ensure that unfairness is clearly seen and can therefore be corrected quickly. It is essential that the ethic of fairness apply to all key organizational processes such as hiring, promotion, compensation, discipline, and termination. Favoritism and nepotism undermine organizational trust. They cannot be tolerated. People are often prone to envy and any perceived unfairness exacerbates this tendency greatly, giving it the energy of justification.

Creating a Culture of Love and Care

Ultimately we cannot create high trust organizations without creating cultures based on love and care. The people we usually trust the most are the people that we also believe genuinely love and care for us. All too often, love and care are not qualities that we associate with organizations. We tend to look for love and friendship with our families and friends, but not from our work. Why is this? Many people believe that love and care in the organizational setting interfere with efficiency and get in the way of making the "tough but necessary" decisions that the organization requires for success. This type of thinking reflects our own lack of integration of love and care in our own lives. We have created an artificial barrier that is holding back our own personal growth and the full potential of our organizations.
Fear is the opposite of love. When fear predominates in the organization, love and care cannot flourish. The opposite is also true--love and care banish fear. How can we create more love and care in our organizations? To answer this would require another essay and perhaps even an entire book. After discovering the higher organizational purpose, nothing is more important than encouraging and nurturing love and care. Here are a few suggestions that will hopefully stimulate further thinking on this incredibly important goal of creating more love and care in our organizations:

• The leadership must embody genuine love and care. This cannot be faked. If the leadership doesn't express love and care in their actions then love and care will not flourish in the organization. As Gandhi said: "We must be the change that we wish to see in the world."

• We must "give permission" for love and care to be expressed in the organization. Many organizations are afraid of love and care and force them to remain hidden. Love and care will flow naturally when we give them permission and encourage them.

• We should consider the virtues of love and care in all of our leadership promotion decisions. We shouldn't just promote the most competent, but also the most loving and caring. Our organizations need both and we should promote leaders who embody both.

• Cultivate forgiveness rather than judgment and condemnation. Too many organizations believe that judgment of others and criticizing failures are essential for creating excellence. While striving for excellence is important for all organizations, this can be done at a higher level of consciousness without condemnation. Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning mistakes and failures. It simply means that we help the other person to learn from their mistakes through non-judgmental feedback and encouragement.

• End all your organizational meetings with "appreciations". This is something that Whole Foods Market has been doing for about 25 years now with wonderful results for spreading love and care. Give everyone participating in the meeting the opportunity to voluntarily appreciate and thank other members in the group for services they have contributed or qualities that are admired. This one simple cultural practice of appreciating our fellow team members moves us out of judgment and fear into the consciousness of love.

Conclusion

We have the opportunity to create more conscious and higher trust organizations in the 21st century. To do so will require three major changes. First the organization must become conscious of what its higher purposes are. Without consciousness of higher purposes organizations will not reach their fullest potential because the creative energy within the organization will not be fully expressed.
Secondly, we'll need our leaders to evolve to higher levels of consciousness and trust themselves. We will not be able to create high trust organizations without more conscious and high trust leaders. Less conscious leaders will tend to hold their organizations back.

Thirdly, we will need to evolve the cultures of our organization in ways that create processes, strategies, and structures that encourage higher levels of trust. These will necessarily include the important ideals of teams, empowerment, transparency, authentic communication, fairness, love and care.
After delivering a GDC panel on his cinematic inspiration, we met with Metroid: Other M  producer Yoshio Sakamoto to ask him about everything from collaborating with Team Ninja, lessons learned from Metroid Prime, the newfound focus on story in the Metroid universe, and whether or not he played Chair's Super Metroid love letter, Shadow Complex. Read on!

Can you tell us about the process of working with Team Ninja. Who does what design-wise and technology-wise?

Yoshio Sakamoto: The original design concept came from me, but then we went and assembled a team that could pull this off. And in this case it was people from Team Ninja, who we really thought was the best fit. But they've also provided a lot of core ideas that have influenced the direction of the game, particularly the director, Mr. Hayashi. So, as I mentioned in the speech today, it's not so much that we're dividing up tasks but collaborating as equals.

After E3 and the initial announcement a lot of people were making comments like, "Oh, it seems like they've dumped Retro for this series and they want to go with another developer," as if it was a big switch-off. But, in actuality, that is far from the case; rather, we just wanted to put together the best team that we could to make this project, which turns out to be Project M.
Gallery: Metroid: Other M



Retro obviously produced the Metroid Prime series; very successful, very influential. Do you consider this a reboot of the series after Metroid Prime? Is this the direction for future Metroids or just another direction?

The games that I've been involved with in the Metroid series have been on the NES, GameBoy, Super NES and the GBA. I actually didn't have a lot of input on the Prime series. But when they're doing with Other M here, it's not so much a different universe, it's just a different part of the story. You can't say that there's no relation here; it's probably best to think of them as being in parallel in this world.

What, if anything, has the team learned from Prime?

I've been working on 2D Metroid games all the way up until now, so when we had a chance to see the Prime games, which suddenly take the series to the 3D space, we realized people found it to have a really good visual impact, and they really did want that kind of enhanced visual experience. And so, I have to say I'm certainly influenced by people's desires in that direction.

There are some points in Other M that are going to feel a bit like the Prime series in terms of the visual experience they offer. But what we're really trying to do is bring the ease of play you found in the 2D series forward. But certainly Prime was a very cool series and we've taken some notes there.

Seeing as how Prime had a very Western focus,
Other M is "a really good intro" to the Metroid universe.
is Other M intended to revitalize the Metroid franchise in Japan?

I have to say we're definitely thinking globally. We want to drive the elements that people have really attached fondness to in the Metroid series. And so we're actively working to find out what people want, but we're not just thinking about the ideas of gamers in Japan. We're definitley thinking about everyone.

Will there be any online component to Other M? And, if not, why isn't online a priority?

There's no online functionality in this title, and the reason for that is that Other M does not rely on that as one of the core design ideas. They're thinking more about the single-player style that you've seen in all Metroid games up until this point. And one of the specific goals here is to convey the charm of Samus as a character and to bring forth several perspectives on what kind of personality she has and how she reacts to situations. So online wouldn't really factor into that kind of character development as a core idea. If they were going to design a Metroid game with an online functionality it really would've had to have come in at the ground floor, when they come up with the design of the game.

The understanding of the Metroid world is not something you can really take for granted among every single gamer out there. There are some people who are new to this series and some people who've been with it for a long time. So one of the first tasks is to bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe. And this game focuses as a really good intro, as well as a really good new challenge to that world. Once you raise the level of awareness of what the Metroid universe is like, then you can start to think about bringing completely new gameplay ideas that haven't been present before.
Presence-enabled communities will be the “primary market driver” behind mobile demand for Web 2.0 applications and services that will generate $18.9 billion in 2014, according to figures released this morning from Juniper Research. Carriers will have a chance to tap into that market if they can effectively evolve beyond their traditional role as network operators.

As loosely defined by Juniper, mobile Web 2.0 features the web as a platform for applications and the user as both creator and consumer of content. That broad definition includes offerings such as mobile Skype as well as basic chat services, social networks and location-aware services such as Foursquare and Gowalla that feature community. A combination of ads, data charges and premium services will be among the key revenue streams, Juniper said.

The market for mobile Web 2.0 is one that AT&T is trying to tap with Buzz.com, a new, Yelp-like social recommendations site that will likely embrace presence management as it matures. (The offering, which is aimed at helping users find the right local business based on reviews from friends and family, launched in January and is in closed alpha.) The problem for operators, though, will be in getting their apps in the hands of users on other networks. That’s an entirely new strategy for carriers, which have long deployed products and services solely to attract new subscribers and hold on to the customers they already have. If AT&T or any of its competitors can make a go of it, they could tap an entirely new business model beyond merely being mobile network operators.
The building next to us is finally getting its windows cleaned.  It's been one year since ours were last done.  The little platform that the cleaners used has been rusting outside so I guess these simple repairs take time around here.  Maybe we shouldn't complain as a friend of ours says his building's windows have not been cleaned since he moved in almost three years ago.

On Tuesday we attended a fancy dinner reception that honored America's President's Day.  It was sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi and we saw many diplomats and army/navy brass.  I met a librarian from the State Department here and he kindly put me on his mailing list. 

On Friday morning I and a friend walked in the annual Terry Fox Run.  It took place along the Corniche and it was nice to be outside walking.  I used sunscreen and wore a long brimmed Tilley hat but one part of my neck still got sunburned.    

Darcy is nearing the end of Week 30 of the pregnancy.   Only 10 weeks to go before The Arrival.  We finished reading a couple of baby names books and we're now looking at each others' lists.  We only wrote down a couple of names that were the same but it should be fun trying to narrow down the list of boy and girl first and middle names.  Of course this is based on the assumption that the name will fit the baby after s/he is born. It will have to have a name before we can do all the paperwork and leave the hospital.
Anyone here interested about Warhammer games? I am not a huge Warhammer fan more like Warcraft, Age of empire enthusiast when it comes to RTS games. But i have to agree i enjoyed Warhammer 40k games. The online reason now i am downloading the beta cause i read GameInformer( June 08 ) article on this game and several gameplay features made me a future fan. I want to add some quote from GI - "...the focus has shifted toward encouraging players to taka part in large public PvP areas that can be found in nearly every zone." Check the IGNs beta preview if you want to learn more about the almost finished game. http://pc.ign.com/articles/906/906266p2.htmlFrom the sceenshots and gameplay video game is looking exceptionally polished and ready to go. I am hoping to post another blog after playing the game for several hours. i never played World of warcraft and only MMORPG i played for over 100 hours is Dungeon Runners. i never like the monthly subscription fee that is $15, warhammer will have same kinda fee, so i am sure i am not going to play the full game even if i like the game, in my opinion online game should follow the fps game rule like Team Fortress, Call of Duty, where you buy a game and play as long as you wish without paying extra money.if you are wondering from where i am downloading the beta, the answer is on the image above - Fileplanet. From their site beta will be playable from September 7th so i am going to play that game 12 days before most the gamers and also i don't have to pay a dime. It will take some time to finish the downloading - it's almost 10 GB (9.38 exactly). According to the official site so far almost 900K people applied for beta participation, not bad for game that is not related with WOW.
On Sunday's Newsroom, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin disputed the conclusion of the Los Angeles Times on the apparently shocking new political initiative of Clarence Thomas's wife Virginia Thomas, that it "could give rise to conflicts of interest for her husband...as it tests the norms for judicial spouses." Toobin defended Mrs. Thomas' grassroots conservative work.

Anchor Don Lemon brought on the senior legal analyst just before the bottom of the 10 pm Eastern hour to discuss  Kathleen Hennessey's article in the Sunday L.A. Times, titled "Justice's wife launches 'tea party' group." The Times writer indicated that Mrs. Thomas' new organization somehow risked the partiality of the Court, as indicated in the article’s subtitle, "The nonprofit run by Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is likely to test notions of political impartiality for the court." She continued later that "the move by Virginia Thomas, 52, into the front lines of politics stands in marked contrast to the rarefied culture of the nation's highest court, which normally prizes the appearance of nonpartisanship and a distance from the fisticuffs of the politics of the day."
Story Continues Below Ad ↓

Hennessey also cited "expert on legal ethics" Stephen Gillers of NYU, who advised Justice Thomas to "be on alert for possible conflicts, particularly those involving donors to his wife's nonprofit. 'There is opportunity for mischief if a company with a case before the court, or which it wants the court to accept, makes a substantial contribution to Liberty Central in the interim.'"

Toobin, who over two years earlier accused Justice Thomas of displaying "a distinct solicitude ... for employers over employees, for government over individuals, for corporations over regulators, and for executioners over the condemned" in his term on the Supreme Court, actually brushed aside such concerns, citing Mrs. Thomas' long involvement in politics. He only raised the issue of "whether it's good judgment, and whether it's a appropriate thing to do."

In 1959, a strapping young Trinidadian named Mike Quashie emigrated to New York and helped ignite the limbo dance craze. He became a darling of the city’s society set, a fixture of the downtown fashion scene and a sort of left-field rock icon.

In the 1960s, Mr. Quashie’s troupe included a dancer named Jean Lee, fresh to New York from her hometown of Atlantic City. Mr. Quashie took her under his wing for a few years until they went their separate ways and lost touch.

Last year, Mr. Quashie left his longtime apartment in Greenwich Village for an assisted-living residence in the Bronx. He had no family around him, no money, few visitors. While other residents displayed chipper family photographs, Mr. Quashie put up a faded snapshot from his Apollo days. His old carnival masks hung next to his walker.

But suddenly, there in the home full of strangers, he saw a face from the old days, someone who knew this man before his magnificent body had gone soft and slow, before his back and his knees became shot from the strain of the limbo.

It was Ms. Lee. Her dancing days long behind her, she was now a psychiatric nurse at this very home.

“When she came in the room to say hello, I just completely flipped out,” Mr. Quashie, 79, said the other day. “I said, ‘I don’t believe that I’m in a home and here’s Jean.’ ”

Ms. Lee, 72, said that Mr. Quashie’s name jumped out at her when she heard a list of new admissions. “I said, ‘Wait a minute — is he from Trinidad?’ ” she recalled. “I said: Send him to me. That’s someone I know very well, and that I’d take care of him.”

Susan Quist, a friend of Mr. Quashie who handles many of his affairs, said Mr. Quashie’s social workers selected the Bronx home, a residence near Fordham Road operated by Jewish Home Lifecare, from a list that she requested for him. “It’s a minor miracle” that his paths crossed with Ms. Lee, she said. “Jean sings his praises around that place, and shares his stories. He’s the big man on campus there now.”
Three years ago, Steve Skvara won the admiration of many in the mainstream media by basically calling for taxpayers to foot his wife’s health insurance. Now he's ba-a-ack!  No longer hailed by Chris Matthews or People's Weekly World, he still manages favorable, unquestioning coverage.  Today's nwi.com Web site, which bills itself as "the largest and most trusted media company in northern Indiana," carries the article "Health care spark gets a checkup."  Written by editorial page editor Doug Ross, the piece starts:

    In December, Steve Skvara of Union Township was hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for 28 hours in hopes of a clean bill of health. He emerged with a bill for $96,000.

    It was pleasant, he said, to have a waiter in a tux deliver his meal, but was that really necessary?

    His experience is relevant because it was Skvara who lighted the fuse on the health care debate in which the nation is now embroiled.

    It was on Aug. 7, 2007, that Skvara asked the seven Democratic presidential candidates what they would do to get health care to "the woman I love." Skvara explained that he lost much of his pension when LTV collapsed, and he was forced to sit across from his wife at the kitchen table, knowing he couldn't afford her health care.

At the “Bigg Digg Shindigg” event at the South by Southwest Interactive Conference (SXSWi), Digg CEO Jay Adelson revealed that the popular social bookmarking site is getting a major overhaul, teasing the audience about new features such as personalized feeds and the return of the Digg (Digg) leaderboard.

The new version of the website is not yet available. However, if you visit New.Digg.com, you can sign up for the alpha and see a preview of what the new Digg will look like in the background. Mr. Adelson told the crowd that the site was “five years in the making.”

While the company didn’t reveal much about the new website, it seems that there will be a cleaner interface, more personalization options, the ability to submit news items with one click, and brings back the leaderboard for top users.

Digg’s famous website buttons are also getting revamped. In fact, if you Digg an article on Mashable (Mashable), you will see the new buttons in action, as we are currently helping test them.

We’re going to try to put up a video of the announcement, along with more details on the new version of Digg as soon as we can. In the meantime, I’ve put up screenshots from New.Digg.com and enhanced the brightness to make viewing the new interface easier.

Update: Digg’s Steve French left some more interesting information in the Digg comment thread for this post. Here it is in its entirety:

    “Top to bottom, the entire company has been in overdrive for this project. There are amazing things coming, and I’m glad the screen shots and presentation didn’t spill everything we have in the works for you guys.

    My favorite new feature… it’s *blazing* fast. There has been a lot of effort that’s gone into the architecture and monitoring of performance.”
A week ago, the Houston Cougars were in a bad way. Aubrey Coleman, the team's star forward and the leading scorer in all of Division I, scored 38 points. Unfortunately it was too little too late, as the Cougars erased a 17 point deficit but still lost, 79-76. Add to that the fact that the loss came against Tulane, a team that had lost 14 of their last 16 games.
The loss was Houston's fourth in their last six games, and certainly their most demoralizing. It quickly turned them from a team with a chance to a team just hoping to not embarrass themselves in the Conference USA Tournament.
They got an easy win to open the tournament, making sure to show up in a blowout win over lowly East Carolina. That only earned them a date with regular season runner-up Memphis. Sure, Memphis was their last truly impressive win (92-75), but that was more than two weeks prior.
Somehow, the Cougars held on to beat Memphis by one, 66-65, then Southern Mississippi. It led them to a shot at the conference title and an automatic tournament bid, but it also meant facing the C-USA regular season champion, the University of Texas-El Paso (UTEP).
With five minutes left in the game, Coleman - he of the 26 points per game to lead the country, was having a truly awful day, shooting 2-of-17 from the field. Fortunately for him his teammate Kelvin Lewis - the only other Cougar to average more than eight points per game in the regular season - caught fire. 
At that same point in time, Lewis has 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting, including five three-pointers, and the Cougars were down 67-64 after a pair of UTEP free throws. Later, Lewis earned his last points of the game with one last long-range shot, and after a timeout, Houston made another three to give themselves a 74-70 lead.
UTEP only made one basket in the last two minutes, and now Houston is the C-USA champion for the first time in 18 years. Some might view them as a "one-and-done" type team, but with the nation's leading scorer, and now a second player in Lewis that defenses must respect, the Cougars just might make some noise when the Madness continues next week.
Twitter founder Evan Williams was widely expected to announce an advertising platform at the SXSW conference, but while he announced something with dozens of major media partners, it wasn’t an ad platform — it was something called @anywhere. And what is @anywhere? Good question. In fact, that’s just one of the many good questions that attendees hoped in vain would be asked by Umair Haque of Harvard Business Review, whose interviewing skills received less-than-critical acclaim  during and after the keynote.

The official Twitter blog entry about the launch of @anywhere isn’t much help when it comes to answering the question of what the new service is — or at least it’s not as much help as you might expect it to be, what with this being one of the most hotly awaited SXSW keynotes in recent memory. The blog post describes the service as recreating the kind of “open, engaging interactions” between users that Twitter provides, but integrating that into any web site through Javascript, and thus “providing a new layer of value for visitors without sending them to Twitter.com.”

And that’s pretty much it. No descriptions of what this might involve, no screenshots of what it might look like (although the Los Angeles Times seems to have whipped up its own), just some logos of partners like eBay and Yahoo and Digg. The way Twitter has described it, @anywhere will allow readers of articles at the New York Times and other sites to click and follow writers directly from their bylines, and — judging by what Evan Williams told Anil Dash on Twitter — will also let them click and see information about popular Twitter users who are mentioned on a participating site, by way of a popup window triggered by mousing over a link, similar to the hover popups at Twitter.com. Embedded below is a video clip that Kirsten Cluthe of MediaBistro shot of the Twitter founder describing how sites will use @anywhere.
It's incredible what you can learn from television these days.  On Saturday, Brent Frazier of Nashville's CBS affiliate reported on a local Coffee Party.  He made no mention of the attendance, but at about 2:06 of the video says:

    The Coffee Party, though very much still in the organizing phase, is loosely based on smaller government and lower taxes.

I have to wonder how the newshound came to that conclusion.  Was it because the group's founder, as noted by NewsBuster Matthew Balan, worked as a volunteer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign?  Or maybe it was the Reuters acknowledgment that "America’s conservative Tea Party movement may be on the boil, but the left is brewing up its own version in The Coffee Party USA."  Or perhaps it was the Coffee Party participant Frazier interviewed who volunteered for Obama but is now disillusioned because "they (Democrats) speak an agenda, but as soon as it's challenged they back down."  Obama's just not pushing left hard enough.

With reporting skills like that, one thing is clear.  Brent has a very bright future in the mainstream media.

This is a fun treat and most enjoyable thing for all the foot ball lovers. Many more upcoming events are added here and updates are done really fast so that no one cannot miss any events happening around in the FIFA world. I really enjoyed this site and thought of sharing with you folks have a great time.
Well. Here's an album that should require no introduction for those of you who grew up, or reached prime headbanging age, during the grunge '90s.

Houdini was The Melvins' first album for major label, Atlantic, and came out at a time when many "alternative" rock bands were riding the crest of the post-Nirvana wave. In fact, long-time friend of The Melvins and scene prince, Kurt Cobain shares a producer credit on the album and even lends instrumentation on two of its tracks.

Amazing how these things work out, considering The Melvins were one of the originators of the heavy metal-punk hybrid that came to be known as "the Seattle Sound". First to wail, and among the last to get a big record deal.

I listened to this album on Grooveshark the other night for what had to be the first time in over 10-12 years. Just as awesome as I remembered it, and I was surprised to find that I remembered most of the songs (I never owned a copy and was usually pulling this one out of my friends' collections). This 14 song version seems to be pulled from a Japanese CD release which includes the MC5 cover, "Rocket Reducer No. 62" .

Rather than wade through a track-by-track highlight reel, let me just assure you that this album rocks heavily and should have you banging your head in no time. You may run out of steam by the time you get to the latter part of the record, with its more difficult, noisy percussion tracks. Still, the surprising catchiness and monster riffs of Houdini's earlier tunes, along with the faithfully executed MC5 closer, may leave you wondering if it's actually legal for one band to kick so much ass.
Glenn Beck says Christians should leave churches that use the word "social justice." He says social justice is a code word for communism and Nazism.

But since the Catholic Church, the Black Churches, the Mainline Protestant churches, more and more Evangelical and Pentecostal churches including Hispanic and Asian-American congregations all consider social justice central to biblical faith, Glenn Beck is telling all those Christians to leave their churches. Of course, Christians may disagree about what social justice means in our current political context -- and that conversation is an important one -- but the Bible is clear: from the Mosaic law of Jubilee, to the Hebrew prophets, to Jesus Christ, social justice is an integral part of God's plan for humanity.

Beck says Christians should leave their social justice churches, so I say Christians should leave Glenn Beck. I don't know if Beck is just strange, just trying to be controversial, or just trying to make money. But in any case, what he has said attacks the very heart of our Christian faith, and Christians should no longer watch his show. His show should now be in the same category as Howard Stern. Stern practices pornography and Beck denies the central teachings of Jesus and the Bible. So Christians should stop watching the Glenn Beck show and pray for him and Howard Stern.

Beck also said that if his church was about "social justice" he would report his church to the church authorities. What authorities? Church bodies as diverse in their theology as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of Evangelicals have explicitly endorsed social justice as a biblical imperative.

So here's an idea: how about reporting ourselves to Glenn Beck as church members and pastors who practice and preach social justice.

Since Sojourners' mission is "to articulate the biblical call to social justice," I'll be the first to turn myself in. And I invite you to join me in turning yourself in to Glenn Beck as a Christian who believes in social justice. Let's send him thousands of names.
Microsoft has said that it will require applications developers for its upcoming Windows Phone OS to sell their apps exclusively through the company’s official storefront, reversing a long-held strategy of allowing a host of third-party retailers to sell Windows Mobile offerings. It’s a move that’s sure to destroy some of the developer goodwill Microsoft has worked so hard to build up in recent weeks.

WinMo users have long been able to download apps from distributors such as GetJar, PocketGear.com and Handango in addition to Microsoft’s Windows Marketplace for Mobile. But the new policy will force developers to comply with Microsoft’s content and technical regulations to bring their Windows Phone wares to market. (Microsoft said business customers will be allowed to distribute apps outside Windows Phone Marketplace.) Astoundingly, the news came just hours after Microsoft showcased its Silverlight technology and released developer tools for Windows Phone to make the OS more attractive and sway developers into its camp.

Microsoft is following the lead of Apple, of course, which has consistently angered developers by refusing to allow third-party distribution of iPhone apps and by employing inconsistent approval policies for its App Store. Apple can continue to employ such a strategy thanks to the overwhelming popularity of the iPhone, but Microsoft obviously doesn’t have that luxury. Supporting third-party retailers would surely hurt Microsoft’s overall revenue, but the overwhelming majority of users will take the path of least resistance and shop at the source rather than seek out smaller vendors. So the company would do well to immediately issue some clear-cut approval policies for its upcoming app store — or, better yet, to rethink the strategy entirely.
Instead of joining us on the right side of history, all the Republicans can come up with is, “slow down, stop everything, let’s start over.” If you think you’ve heard these same excuses before, you’re right. When this country belatedly recognized the wrongs of slavery, there were those who dug in their heels and said “slow down, it’s too early, things aren’t bad enough.”

Most responses to Reid have furiously concentrated on his spurious slavery analogy, but I’d like to call attention to his expression of what has become a staple of liberal thought that is even more disturbing: the accusation that those who reject liberal nostrums are “on the wrong side of history.”

For some reason, the Democratic caucus these days seems to be filled with deep thinkers who have cracked the code of the meaning and direction of history. Just a couple of weeks ago the sage of Ohio, Senator Sherrod Brown, told the New York Times that “I don’t think in the end, anybody here in our caucus wants to be on the wrong side of history.”

This uncanny ability to get in step with history is, of course, not limited to Democrats who are elected. For example, a recent Nicholas Kristof column, “The Wrong Side of History,” charged that if moderate Democrats “flinch” and health care reform fails, “they’ll be on the wrong side of history.”

In fact, it’s not limited to Democrats at all, as evidenced by John McCain’s comment on Face the Nation last June “that the United States needs to be on the ‘right side of history’ in responding to the disputed Iranian elections and ensuing protests.”

Thus history, it must be noted, does not have a narrow, one-track mind. Its commands, clearly visible to those standing on its right, i.e., left, side, are not limited to the enactment of ObamaCare; they extend over the full range of the liberal agenda.

For example, University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone transmits the message from history’s lips to Huffington Post’s ears that all those who fail to accept “the moral analogy between discrimination against blacks and discrimination against gays … have simply blinded themselves to reason” and, you guessed it, “are on the wrong side of history.” (I have recently discussed this “moral analogy” and some questions it raises here.)
At last week’s PDC, the new name for our repository and modeling project was announced – we are the SQL Server Modeling Services!James Baker and Shoshanna Budzianowski did an awesome job of describing the Modeling Services database and how to get value from the domain models which are delivered in the latest CTP. Check out the video of their session here. This shows the value of a queriable database of UML and Assembly metadata in realistic developer scenarios. The use of regular SQL Server Reporting Services reports and Excel to analyze and drill in to information is a direct result of making the metadata schemas ordinary relational structures using clear language from the domains. I especially like the query that returns all uses of an interface across the System.Runtime and Microsoft.Uml2 domains including a UML diagram loaded into our database from IBM’s Rational Software Architect using an exported XMI file.Also worth looking at is Kim Cameron and Gert Drapers’ presentation of the System.Identity model wwhich is part of the Modeling Services CTP, and will play an increasingly important role across other domains in the future. You can see their presentation here.Get the latest Modeling Services CTP from here.
We now know how Conan O’Brien plans to leverage the huge swell of support he found online in the wake of being forced out at NBC: a nationwide comedy tour.

The comedian announced on his Twitter account this morning the launch of TeamCoco.com, where fans can buy tickets to one of 30 shows, kicking off in Eugene, Oregon, on April 12. The tour, fittingly enough, is called “The Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour,” a reference to the deal he made with NBC that keeps O’Brien off the air until the fall.

A comedy tour has been rumored since shortly after Conan stepped down, and we suspected something might be in the works when he finally joined Twitter (Twitter) (and immediately found a huge fan base, and changed one random girl’s life along the way). Now, Conan officially has an outlet to keep the momentum going while he determines his next move on TV.
Suvendu Roy, of Titan Industries shares his inspirational encounter with a rickshaw driver in Mumbai: 

Last Sunday, my wife, kid, and I had to travel to Andheri from Bandra.
When I waved at a passing auto rickshaw, little did I expect that this ride would be any different... 

As we set off, my eyes fell on a few magazines (kept in an aircraft style pouch) behind the driver's back rest. 

I looked in front and there was a small TV. The driver had put on the Doordarshan channel. 

My wife and I looked at each other with disbelief and amusement. In front of me was a small first-aid box with cotton, dettol and some medicines.

This was enough for me to realise that I was in a special vehicle. 

Then I looked round again, and discovered more - there was a radio, fire extinguisher, wall clock, calendar, and pictures and symbols of all faiths
- from Islam and Christianity to Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism. 

There were also pictures of the heroes of 26/11- Kamte, Salaskar, Karkare and Unnikrishnan. 

I realised that not only my vehicle, but also my driver was special.

I started chatting with him and the initial sense of ridicule and disbelief gradually diminished. 

I gathered that he had been driving an auto rickshaw for the past 8-9 years; he had lost his job when hisemployer's plastic company was shut down. 

He had two school-going children, and he drove from 8 in the morning till 10 at night. 

No break unless he was unwell. "Sahab, ghar mein baith ke T.V dekh kar kya faida? Do paisa income karega toh future mein kaam aayega."

We realised that we had come across a man who represents Mumbai - the spirit of work, the spirit of travel and the spirit of excelling in life.
I asked him whether he does anything else as I figured that he did not have too much spare time.
Microsoft is betting that Silverlight — a web application framework and rival technology to Adobe’s Flash — can help it woo mobile developers to its upcoming Windows Phone operating system. So far, at least, the strategy appears to be working.

The gang from Redmond used its MIX10 event in Las Vegas this morning to release some free developer tools as well as to demonstrate some of the first third-party applications written for Windows Phone, which seeks to embrace mobile entertainment in ways Windows Mobile simply couldn’t. Corporate VP Joe Belfiore showed off a slick mobile version of the 3D Xbox title The Harvest to demonstrate Silverlight’s capabilities, as well as a news app from AP and a multimedia journal that leverage the technology.

Microsoft also trotted out some impressive third-party partners. Developers who’ve signed on to build atop Windows Phone include EA Mobile, Foursquare, Pandora and Sling Media. Microsoft still faces a challenge in growing that list, though, thanks largely to the fact that Windows Phone will be incompatible with Windows Mobile and won’t debut until late this year. But if the company can continue to secure third-party developers and offer an impressive app catalog as the first devices come to market, Microsoft may find itself back in the game with the Apples and Googles of the smartphone world.
History is full of examples of conquests that seemed easy and tempting, but later turned out to be gigantic blunders. One of them was Napoleon’s decision to invade Spain in 1808 and put his elder brother Joseph on the throne. That was the first great miscalculation of his career.

I strongly suspect that Obama’s decision to “reform” American health care by thoroughly politicizing it will become his Spain — a short-run victory that will in the long run prove disastrous for him.

Napoleon and Spain

In 1808, Napoleon was the master of continental Europe. To his south, Spain was officially an ally, but it was a nation long past its age of military power. The Spanish army was no match for the French and Napoleon was certain he could easily crush it, capture Madrid, and send the corrupt King Charles IV packing. Under the conventions of warfare at that time, once you had beaten the enemy army and taken the capital city, fighting ceased and the victor could enjoy the spoils of war. Napoleon, the great conqueror, couldn’t resist this piece of low-hanging fruit.

Things did not go according to Napoleon’s plans. Defeating the Spanish army was easy enough, as was the business of putting Joseph on the throne. But afterward, the country erupted in partisan warfare that gave us the word “guerilla.” French garrisons and supply trains were attacked. Spain was drenched in blood and the drain on French resources and manpower was debilitating. For Napoleon, conquering Spain was a self-inflicted wound that turned gangrenous.
The LA Times report on ethical concerns raised by Virginia Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas, who is an active tea partyer and conservative campaigner. But it will make no difference to anything. And here's why.

In January, report the Times, Virginia, who goes by Ginni, started a non-profit lobbying group called Liberty Central that will "organize activism around a set of conservative "core principles"." She's been on panels at CPAC and worked for the Heritage Foundation, where Dick Cheney is sometimes a speaker. On the surface it's worrying — it's unfeasible to assume that the couple do not discuss politics, and are not somewhat influenced by each others views. But:

    * Clarence Thomas is not his wife: what if he's a centrist and merely tolerates his wife's leanings? What if they're James Carville and Mary Matalin? And if that's not the case...
    * People are less stupid than blogs (like this one) make out: assuming he is right-wing, and fully supports his wife's views, and keeps a laminated picture of Leo Strauss in his wallet, Thomas is doubtless an intelligent man with a comprehensive grasp of the law. It is somewhat ludicrous to argue that, if he wanted to, he could not utterly separate his views from his work. He was born dirt poor, experienced appalling racism and still occasionally votes against (perceived) black interests. If he can make that separation, why assume he can't make this one? But if even that is too much of a stretch...
    * Every judge holds political views: there's a myth that judges are apolitical. Which is ridiculous. However much Justice Scalia says he's merely a constitutional literalist, he's clearly not a secret ACLU member in his spare time. A child of eight could map each justice on a left/right spectrum with very little difficulty. Is it a surprise that the Thomas household leans right? Not if you look at his decisions. So his wife's activism will make little difference even if it makes all the difference it possible could.
If 2010 proves to be a “wave” election for the GOP, conservatives can expect more than a few half-as-much Republicans to sweep into Congress.  What’s a half-as-much Republican? One who’s willing to do half as much as liberals on big government initiatives. Guys like John McCain and his sidekick, Lindsey Graham, for instance.  Or Maine’s Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. Or departing Senator George Voinovich.

But there’s an effective way to put half-as-much Republicans on notice: defeat a couple of them in upcoming primaries, especially in high-profile Senate contests.

Sending a couple of half-as-muchers to summertime defeats would create quite a stir and cause other such critters, like Mark Kirk (IL) and Mike Castle (DE), to pause. Kirk and Castle are the likely GOP Senate nominees in their states. It would also be a shot across the bow of the GOP Senate leadership, which otherwise might generously want to accommodate its half-as-much brethren in the 112th Congress.

The aforementioned John McCain and Florida Governor Charlie Crist are both ripe for the picking. Both face stiff primary challenges. Senator McCain is squaring off against former U.S. Representative JD Hayworth. Crist is already battling for his political life against former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio.

No conservative worth his salt is unaware of the notorious “independence” of John McCain, Arizona’s senior senator. Having long ago wiggled from his conservative cocoon, the senator prides himself on his eclectic policy choices. He is gainst government-run health care but for cap and trade (and then against it as the 2008 election progressed). He’s a true blue warrior in the war on terror but squishy in the war to secure the nation’s southern border.
Do you believe that extending unemployment compensation benefits encourages some people to remain out of work longer than necessary? Don't let CNN anchor Ali Velshi find out.  He'll characterize you as unsavory.

On a segment of CNN Newsroom today, Velshi spoke with an economics professor who's examined multiple studies reporting that many people find work shortly before their unemployment checks lapse:

    VELSHI: Hey, complicated, complicated question that is at the root of our recovery as a nation; it is about jobs. The average person on unemployment is on it for about six months. You can get up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefits, with the certain extensions that we have passed these days. But the average person is on for about six months.

    The question here is are long-term jobless benefits actually leading people to stay unemployed longer? I have somebody here who has actually crunched a few numbers for us. Robert Shimer is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, and inadvertently has gotten himself piled in with a bunch of unsavories who say -- who like to make the argument that people are choosing not to get jobs. And Robert, you have heard it said. This is the US Chamber -- not the US Chamber of Commerce. I'm sorry, the Club for Growth has said it on this show that it is causing people -- that it's a disincentive for people to go back to work because of unemployment benefits, which I think is a little bit insulting to the millions of people on unemployment. Your argument is it a little bit more nuanced than that.

After getting over the initial disappointment of finding ourselves in what I thought were going to be floor seats but ended up not being floor seats – the show was amazing. Even not having floor seats, our seats were better than the last time I saw John a couple years ago. In fact the whole show was even better than the last time (even though this time did include a gross amount of PDA by a couple who probably would have been better off staying at home this time did not however, include being hit by the man sitting behind us because we were standing and he thought we should be sitting – long story. You can read a bit about it here).

Michael Franti and Spearhead opened – who I was thoroughly confused by (they played a wide range of music styles and whenever someone in the band didn’t have a part in the song they left the stage). They did  do a really good job of pumping us up – which I suppose is the main task of the opener is.  They are entertainers for sure. Also, the lead singer (Michael Franti) popped up like three rows in front of where we were sitting to do one of his songs. That was pretty sweet.I love John Mayer – I don’t care what people say about him and I don’t even really care what he says. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again - Continuum is one of my favourite albums ever. He is a fantastic musician and a really gifted performer. I’ve been to two shows of his and I’ve had an amazing time at both. I was ready to hitchhike to Toronto to see him again on Sunday night.  I don’t really know what to say – there is just something about seeing one of your favourite artists live. Magic.

Like last time I didn’t take a picture of myself so you’ll just have to believe that these pictures are mine and that I was actually there. Lol.

Less than 0.2 percent of people who use Twitter wind up going to news and media sites from the social-networking site, according to a recent analysis by traffic-measurement firm Hitwise (although Hitwise just looked at traffic coming from the web site, not any third-party apps or services). So what are the top places that users go from Twitter? About 60 percent go to other social networks and entertainment sites, says Hitwise, primarily photo and video-sharing sites — in other words, places like Twitpic, Tweetphoto, YouTube, Vimeo, CollegeHumor and so on. This isn’t all that surprising, since many of the most popular links that get passed around are photos and videos that have “gone viral,” as marketing people love to say.
Before casting “yea” votes in favor of a government health care grab later this week, wavering House Democrats may want to struggle out of the left’s ideological fog for a moment and consider the sad, but instructive, tales of the U.S. Postal Service and the city of Detroit.  Both are poster boys (excuse me, poster persons) for how government can get almost anything gloriously wrong.

That the U.S. Postal Service is swimming in red ink isn’t news. The nation’s postal service, despite its first-class mail monopoly, swims in red ink a lot. The important news to Americans as they follow Washington’s three-ring health care circus is that U.S. Postmaster General Joe E. Potter wants to drop Saturday mail delivery as a cost-cutting measure.

To repeat, the postmaster general wants to reduce service in an effort to staunch red ink. That’s service as in mail delivery, the U.S. Postal Service’s bread and butter. Imagine a hamburger joint announcing to its customers that it plans to stop selling hamburgers a day or two a week to cut costs. Of course, a hamburger joint wouldn’t limit the sale of hamburgers to keep its costs down. The guy who owns the hamburger joint would get creative in his marketing and pricing to sell more hamburgers. He might trim costs operationally but not at the expense of selling as many hamburgers as he and his help could flip. Why the difference? The hamburger joint can go out of business. The U.S. Postal Service, being immune to risk, cannot.

Just like the nation’s postal service, if enacted, government-run health care will eventually have to limit access to services in an attempt — however vain — to contain costs. No? Propaganda? Actually, there’s precedent other than the postal service, and one doesn’t have to look all the way to Great Britain or even Canada to find it.
Every great American boom and bust makes and breaks its share of crooks. The past decade -- call it the Ponzi Era -- has been no different, except for the gargantuan scale of white-collar crime. A vast wave of financial fraud swelled in the first years of the new century.  Then, in 2008, with the subprime mortgage collapse, it crashed on the shore as a full-scale global economic meltdown.  As that wave receded, it left hundreds of Ponzi and pyramid schemes, as well as other get-rich-quick rackets that helped fuel our recent economic frenzy, flopping on the beach.

The high-water marks from that crime wave, those places where the corruption reached its zenith, are still visible today, like the 17th floor of 885 Third Avenue in midtown Manhattan, the nerve center of investment firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities -- and, as it turned out, a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, the largest in history. Or Stanfordville, a sprawling compound on the Caribbean island of Antigua named for its wealthy owner, a garrulous Texan named Allen Stanford who built it with funds from his own $8 billion Ponzi scheme. Or the bizarrely fortified law office -- security cards, surveillance cameras, hidden microphones, a private elevator -- of Florida attorney Scott Rothstein, who duped friends and investors out of $1.2 billion.

The more typical marks of the Ponzi Era, though, aren’t as easy to see. Williamston, Michigan, for instance, lacks towering skyscrapers, Italian sports cars, million-dollar mansions, and massive security systems. A quiet town 15 miles from Lansing, the state capital, Williamston is little more than a cross-hatching of a dozen or so streets. A “DOLLAR TIME$” store sits near Williamston’s main intersection -- locals affectionally call it the "four corners" -- and its main drag is lined with worn brick buildings passed on from one business to the next like fading, hand-me-down jeans. It’s here, far from New York or Antigua, that thanks to two brothers seized by a financial fever dream, the Ponzi Era made its truest, deepest American mark.

Jay and Eric Merkle, active church members and successful local businessmen, were well known among Williamston’s residents. In 2004, the brothers discovered that an oil-and-gas venture, which they had invested in and which promised them quick, lucrative returns, was a scam. They’d been duped. Their next move should have been simple: turn in the crooks and get on with their lives, their pockets a few dollars lighter. Jay and Eric, however, grasped the spirit of their age and made another decision entirely -- they teamed up with the guys who had ripped them off, in the process switching from prey to predator.

That first venture actually floundered, but in 2005, court records show, they started their own Ponzi scheme, Platinum Business Industries (PBI).  Based in Williamston, PBI claimed it was socking its investors’ money into lucrative oil and gas exploration opportunities in Oklahoma and Texas, and it promised the investors absurdly high returns -- 6% a month, or 72% a year. Despite such promises, the brothers assured town locals handing over their hard-earned dollars that little risk was involved.  Even if the energy exploration didn’t pay off, the land acquired by PBI was valuable and could be sold to offset any losses.

Like Madoff in Palm Beach, the Merkles in Williamston exploited local ties -- church and family -- to reel in new investors; and like Madoff's investment fund, PBI, too, was a complete sham, and a classic Ponzi scheme -- that is, an investment scam in which existing investors’ returns are paid for with money from new investors.  In the case of PBI, there was no energy exploration in Oklahoma and Texas.

Some of the money they received from later investors the Merkles used to pay off earlier ones and give their scheme the look of success. But in their case, there was a rub. The Merkles were distinctly creatures of the Ponzi Era: they evidently couldn’t help themselves.  Even as they ran their own Ponzi racket, documents show, they were getting fleeced.  What they weren't paying out in fake returns the Merkles bet on high-yield, get-rich-quick schemes in the U.S. and abroad that had nothing to do with oil and gas -- and other Ponzi schemers and con artists were robbing them blind.

Their financial crime spree collapsed in 2008. Dead-broke, with investigators closing in, they told investors that various foreign governments and banks had frozen their assets.  The brothers then asked them to wire more than a million dollars to Nigeria, Ghana, and other countries as “fees” to release their money, even as they warned them against cooperating with an FBI investigation. Then, on a brisk autumn day in October 2008, the feds arrested to the two brothers; the game was up. In all, via PBI and other scams, they had duped more than 600 investors out of $50 million, robbing some of their life savings.

When compared to Madoff’s or Stanford’s heists, that sum was little more than pocket change. But the Merkle brothers caught the true, democratic spirit of a decade of an unrestrained magical thinking that infected rich and poor, successful and ne’er-do-well, the financially savvy and neophytes who couldn’t tell a stock from a bond. Think of their story as a parable for the Ponzi Era: they were taken, decided to become takers, took others, then got taken again.  In the rush for the pot of gold at rainbow’s end, they bet everything Main Street had to offer, believing they could get away with it.

Thanks to an open credit spigot, a booming housing market, and visions of unimaginable wealth on Wall Street, practically everyone in the United States in the past decade seemed to aspire to get rich -- and quick. Perfectly ordinary people refinanced their homes, refinanced again, and used the money they got to stake themselves at the crooked casino table of American life. Some rolled the dice in stocks, bonds, and second homes. For millions more, the gamble took the form of “investment opportunities” that promised wealth in a hurry, opportunities now exposed as little more than financial con jobs. “People were shooting for that home run,” says Peter Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University and white-collar crime expert. “They were saying, ‘I’m just as smart as Warren Buffet.’”

Today, with easy credit and the buy-now-pay-tomorrow culture that it spawned in the dustbin of history, the Ponzis and pyramid schemes of the past decade can be seen for what they really were. Not a week seems to go by without the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the FBI or law enforcement officials busting another get-rich hustle. Yet the full scope of the criminality of the Ponzi Era remains elusive; no one yet knows just how widespread those Ponzi schemes were -- and how many may remain, hidden or in plain sight.

Beyond the headliners like Madoff and Stanford, Americans may not actually be aware of just how many schemes of this sort were abroad in our land -- but it probably doesn’t matter much either.  Disillusionment with the past decade is such that many Americans now simply assume that our world is little but a giant Ponzi scheme.

Ponzis, Ponzis, Everywhere

The wave of financial crime may have peaked in 2005 or 2006, but the detritus of such collapsed schemes has left regulators and investigators ever busier. Almost four times as many Ponzi schemes broke down in 2009 -- 150 -- as in 2008 -- 40. According to the Associated Press, the FBI began more than 2,100 securities fraud cases last year, an increase from 1,750 the year before.  The SEC likewise dealt out 82% more restraining orders against Ponzi schemes and similar frauds in 2009 than the previous year.
Many on the left are in denial. The  USS Obama, certified as unsinkable a year ago, is taking on water in its bilges. It is starting to list portside in the dark, cold political seas — on its maiden voyage, no less.

The Obama is made of sturdy stuff, the left contends, designed by the smartest engineers. Its skeleton and hull, shaped by unbendable liberal principles. Its engines and turbines, powered by attractive government-growing, corporate-hating proposals. Its furnaces, stoked by legions of young and minority voters, hopelessly idealistic and hungry for change, and by the disaffected middle class, sick of the war on terror and disgusted by a widening income gap with the upper classes. Its watertight compartments — solid Democratic congressional majorities.

In seas thought to be smooth as glass, Captain Barack Obama and his navigators, Rahm Emanuel, David Axelrod, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, plotted a swift course to a safe, statist harbor. Government-run health care, cap and tax, card check, a pork-laden stimulus, and re-imposition of the Fairness Doctrine, among other government-aggrandizing measures, would be achieved by voyage’s end. But the first, momentous voyage wouldn’t be the ship’s last. Not by a long shot.

No, the Obama would venture out to sea again and again until the United States was transformed into a reasonable facsimile of a European welfare state — a state like Britain or France or Germany, with a dash of Venezuela for pizazz. Equality of opportunity, with its inevitable disparate results, would give way to a society of broad, redistributed wealth. The satisfaction of achievement would come not from material reward, but from the compulsory sharing of the reward.
At the tail end of our GDC interview with Lionhead's Peter Molyneux, we remembered one more question we simply had to know: How well did Fable 2's episodic experiment go? We'll refresh your memory: Last August, Molyneux announced plans to release Fable 2 as a series of five downloadable "episodes," with the first one given away and the subsequent four priced at $10 each.

Molyneux's response: "That was hugely successful. There were something like over half a million. I think it was 600,000 downloads of the first episode, which was very, very cool." Of course, the first episode was free so how was the conversion rate? "It was a much higher than a normal conversion rate," Molyneux smiled. "Massively, massively successful, and I really love this relationship, which is much more sliced into episodes with consumers."

Of course, knowing where we were going with this particular line of questioning, Molyneux preemptively offered an answer."But we're not announcing whether that's coming out in this release," he said, tossing a smile towards the attentive PR people behind me.
"The inspiration behind this body of work came from a growing curiosity about recent corporate developments of private space in London that apparently encourage the public to access them. Typically these environments have beautiful landscaping around a canal or lake. An amphitheatre seems to be a further prerequisite as is CCTV which monitors everything including security guards who amble around these empty places. The hustle and bustle of neighboring streets feels a world away. 
 
In the summer of 2008 I went for a series of walks along arterial routes heading out of London. That summer I had read several of J.G. Ballard’s novels including Super Cannes, which is about disturbing behaviour amongst the inhabitants of a gated community isolated from the world. On one of these ambles I chanced upon a recently completed building development. I felt compelled to enter this beautifully landscaped glass and steel environment. It appeared as if no expense had been spared. What I encountered there helped to crystallize some vague ideas that became the photographs that are presented in this collection. The idyllic setting combined with the ever-present ’security’ got under my skin and left me wondering about a dystopian outcome for this kind of world. 
 
I remember sitting down by the artificial lake. The sun was beating down and people casually wandered about. I gazed up at the office blocks. I thought it must be an idyllic place to work. London felt far away. I imagined that you could lift these acres up and deposit them in any city in the world and they would feel at home. This was an anti-Dickensian space, more an abstract one. It was a statement of how the world of work could be. The management ethos, proclaimed on various signs, was ‘enjoy.work’. 
 
Enjoy.work. Arbeit macht frei. Freedom through work. I rose to the bait. Unease crept into my thoughts. 
 
I found myself searching for the cracks. A variety of methods had been used to try to block the sun reaching the interior spaces. It appeared as if, as each building had been erected, ever more elaborate ways had been devised to keep nature out. What was it really like to work in there? 
 
I noticed that an algae bloom threatened the lake’s plant and animal life. Peering into one building’s reception area, I saw how the appearance of leisure had been carefully arranged. Bicycles, guitars and deckchairs in neat rows. An abandoned chess game and open magazines on the coffee table. A half-finished painting-by-numbers canvas on an easel. No one about. Why had everyone had to leave so suddenly? Or, were they trying to hide something? Soon after, I was asked to leave for taking photographs without permission. 
 
After some months I built an architectural model inspired by this corporate campus, and began photographing. I wanted a dystopian world, centred on a dark lake, that seemed to have the opposite effect on those that gazed into it than that intended by the landscape architect. So, some of the ant-like figures turn up to work, use the facilities and leave. Others seem to be employed in extracurricular activities of a more malevolent nature. 
"
President Obama has repeatedly said that failure to pass a health care reform bill is simply not an option.

But Democratic leaders are facing an uphill battle in convincing some of their own members to push the legislation forward -- and hoping history doesn't repeat itself.

There's a lot at stake for Obama's future, political observers say, including the ability to get other key pieces of his legislative agenda passed and signed into law: banking regulation, climate change, economic measures and immigration.

Republicans have marched nearly lockstep against Obama's policy proposals, especially on financial matters, and indicate that they will continue to do so.

The bill's failure could also spell trouble for Democrats facing tough election battles this year. Whether or not the bill is passed, Republicans have threatened to use it against Democratic opponents, noting its cost and effect on the deficit.

As for the costs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Democrats' revised health care bill will cost $940 billion over the next 10 years, a House Democratic source said Thursday. The bill cuts the deficit by $130 billion during that period, according to the source.

The president has stepped up his efforts to sway worried Americans. He put his name on a health care reform proposal last month and then went on a campaign-like barnstorm across the country to warn Americans what will happen if reform isn't passed.

"We need health insurance reform right now," the president said at a rally outside Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday. "This debate is about far more than politics. ... It comes down to what kind of country we want to be."

Obama said the status quo on health care is "simply unsustainable," adding that Americans "cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people."

Editorials in some of the nation's top newspapers have also railed against keeping the status quo.
What it doesn't tell you: the moments this movie is living in is the summer of 2001, and September 11 figures prominently in the final scenes. The end is so controversial, a number of blogs—from New York Magazineto Gawker to even Perez Hilton—gave every detail of it away. This isn't a story for the faint of heart. A junior-high-school-aged girl at my screening left the room weeping. Adults had tears in their eyes. The movie is poised to be one of the biggest tear-jerkers to come out of Hollywood since Titanic.

The question: does Remember Me earn its tears, or exploit September 11 for a cheap cry? If you haven't read about the film online, you'll probably go to the movie (with a tween or two in tow) expecting a sweet romance. And that you'll get, for most of the film. There's the prerequisite cheesy first-date dialogue at an Indian restaurant, and the scene where de Ravin gets so drunk at a college frat party, Pattinson holds her head back while she throws up. None of this prepares you for what ultimately happens, though a violent act in the first scene serves as eerie foreshadowing. When the Twin Towers are hit—we never see an airplane crash, just the debris—it's a complete shock that will leave you sad and stunned for days.

But if you think about it, wasn't that the way we all felt after September 11? The attack was completely unexpected, just like the conclusion of this movie. Other films about September 11 (World Trade Center, United 93) have presented their grim subject matter from the very start, in every TV ad and theatrical trailer. Remember Me is targeted to a different demographic: teenage girls, many of whom were very young in 2001. For them, September 11 is probably a distant memory or maybe even just a lesson in a history book, especially for kids who didn't live in New York or Washington. Given that measure, this movie accurately depicts the horror, danger, grief, rage, meaninglessness, and brutality of that day. It actually honors history, albeit in a strange and unsettling way.
I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining.  I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. But, the guy replied atleast I don't suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. Imagine how much it would suck to be them. Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing. If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a  person with no limbs at all. I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them. For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). But this is what your smart friends do to you. They extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. But this is what I relish. This is what I feel is the best part about having them around. Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. But smarter ones make life interesting. They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. That conversation left me in a similar place. Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend, I wasn't sure I had convinced myself. But, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. Now every time I compare myself in a situation, I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it. Ever since that day, I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere. For the most part, it has helped :) I like analogies. I love drawing parallels in life. Compare one stage with another. Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. To see how as we change we still remain the same. Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. As if it's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the sudden onset of loneliness.
I remember teaching user interface design courses back in the mid-nineties. In those courses there was a slide entitled “Rapid Prototyping,” and on that slide were all the reasons why rapid prototyping was a bad idea. Most of the reasoning centered around prototyping tools being so complex back then, they needed to be operated by developers; subsequently, the design process tended to be influenced by all design work needing to be interpreted through the lens of what a prototyper could actually achieve.

Fast forward to 2010 and there’s been a rethinking on prototyping. A slew of new prototyping tools have appeared over the past few years and they’re rapidly being adopted by interaction designers. I guess the creators of these tools never attended one of my courses! In fact, two things changed to bring prototyping tools back into favor: the tools themselves and the task they’re being used to accomplish.

    *

      Prototyping tools today are much more designer-friendly. The adoption of user interface markup languages (like HTML, XAML, and MXML) our ability to build and run more sophisticated software today has made it easier to create design tools that work for designers, rather than developers.
    *

      At the same time, the nature of what we’re designing is changing. As we move away from designs that are a series of relatively static pages or screens, to designing applications that use fewer, more dynamic pages, it becomes harder to prototype these experiences using the traditional tools of paper prototyping and diagramming applications.

So we have perfect conditions for a new wave of prototyping tools: rising demand and increasing capability. Among this new breed of prototyping tools we find Microsoft Expression Blend SketchFlow (for the purposes of this tutorial, I’ll be referring to it as simply SketchFlow). While maintaining the Microsoft tradition of remarkably long product names, SketchFlow takes a fairly unique approach to prototyping. First, I’d like to point out that SketchFlow is part of Microsoft’s Expression Studio range of design tools. After a lackluster history with design tools, Microsoft seems to be finally getting their act together with Expression Studio (disclaimer: I’ve previously worked at Microsoft). Expression Studio is up to its third release and comprises four or five products depending on how you count them: It’s important to note the relationship between SketchFlow and Expression Blend. Expression Blend is the production tool for Silverlight, Windows (Windows Presentation Foundation), and Surface, whereas SketchFlow is a prototyping tool built on top of Expression Blend.
For the filmmakers at French production company H5, starting with a clean storyline was key. "As everything is a logo, the story had to be as simple as a logo," explains Hervé de Crécy, one of the film's directors, "Efficient. Simple. Hollywood." After the plot was set, every trip to the supermarket was also a casting call for the 2,500 brands that de Crécy estimates finally landed a role. For more inspiration, they browsed among the virtual aisles at brandsoftheworld.com Because Los Angeles is a city of signs built on a structured grid, Hollywood became setting as well as inspiration, which also explains why this French film has English dialogue. The filmmakers generally used established U.S. brands, figuring they have a more universal appeal, but also included logos from other countries, like Japan's beef bowl restaurant Yoshinoya, Germany's Afri cola trees, and Kuwaiti oil company Q8's sailboats. The team originally proposed the world of logos for a music video, but the concept was vetoed. So they worked on the film in secret between other video and commercial projects for the next several years. Working without permissions, they didn't want companies making ads in adjacent studios to catch a glimpse, so they blocked off their small room with a folding fabric screen. In most cases, says de Crécy, they used the logos without authorization, but some companies in the loop actually asked to have their logos be included, such as IBM, which provided some equipment for the project. What the computer giant didn’t get was input on what happened to the logo, which ultimately collapses into itself during the earthquake. The Los Angeles Zoo told the filmmakers that they probably would have said no if asked for permission to use their logo in the onscreen zoo, but in the finished product, they actually liked the heroic way their zookeeper (played by the Green Giant) protects the animals during the disaster. De Crécy, who has a background in graphic design, acknowledges that Logorama is part criticism and part celebration. "Of course it's a tribute to these logotypes and to the designers of all these logotypes. There are many that are absolutely beautiful," he says. But he did enjoy tweaking the familiar symbols. As the director says, assigning new personalities "was a kind of game for us." Near the close of the film, the National Geographic yellow border makes its cameo, tucked into a pouch in the door of the getaway car Big Boy and the Esso girl use to flee the chaos. With the travel literature alongside it (Lonely Planet and a Michelin guide), the vehicle is clearly going to be a get-far-away car. Director de Crécy says our logo was too abstract to turn into a character, but given its square shape, it was a perfect fit to depict ... what else? ... a magazine. Talk about logotypecasting! But this makes a lot of sense, since the logo is derived from the crisp window of yellow trim that frames the magazine. The border first appeared in February 1910; it was adorned with oak leaves and acorns. Over the century, the leaves were slowly dropped from the design; the last ones fell in September 2000, leaving this vivid rectangle. So happy 100th, yellow border. And congrats on the new film career. Hope your agent gets you a starring role next time!
We may not know much more about "lasers" than Austin Powers's nemesis, Dr. Evil, but we can tell you that Logitech has put the technology to outstanding use in its MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse. It's not as huge a shift as it was going from rollerballs to optical sensors, but the MX1000 does usher in a new age in computer mice.

Logitech claims that its new MX Laser Engine is 20 times more sensitive than a standard LED. While it may be able to read a finer image, the MX1000 still uses a relatively common 800-dots-per-inch (dpi) optical sensor--the same as in Logitech's MX510 Performance Mouse. But because the laser tracks movement more accurately than a standard LED, the MX1000 takes a more precise read of the surface, resulting in more exact cursor movement onscreen.

The cursor never jumped or paused in the three months we used it, and in addition to the $80 MX1000's laser precision, it is comfortable to use--for right-handers, anyway. The deeply carved left side provides a snug perch for your thumb, and the rubberized plastic on either side makes for exceedingly comfortable mousing. You'll find three programmable keys above your thumb and three more, including the scrollwheel itself, are on the top.

The wireless mouse ships with an RF base station, which doubles as a battery charger. Battery life is phenomenal; you can go days without recharging. We particularly like the battery-power meter along the top of the mouse. You may forget to recharge the MX1000 at the end of the day because the battery lasts so long on a single charge, so the three green LEDs are a good reminder: when it gets down to one light, it's time to recharge.
Jody Gerut plays outfield for the Milwaukee Brewers. After a good return to the majors in 2008, in which he posted a .351 OBP, Gerut fell to .279 in 2009. At age 32, he can’t afford to play another season like that. Teams won’t continue to pay $2 million for that kind of performance. The interesting thing about 2009 was that Jody upped his line drive percentage. That usually leads to a higher BA, not a lower one. If he maintains that rate, there’s a good chance his luck changes and he winds up with a better 2010. New research shows that Hank Greenberg’s walk rate went way up at the end of 1938 season as he approached Babe Ruth’s single season home run record. Howard Megdal suggests that Greenberg’s religion caused the league to pitch around him, but Greenberg didn’t buy it at the time: Opposing teams tend to walk big home run hitters, and Greenberg showed a big leap in home runs in 1938, from a career high 40 the year before. Greenberg was also 27 that season, at the peak of his athletic performance. I think randomness is as good an explanation as antisemitism. As Megdal says in the article, “It is impossible to know what was in pitchers’ hearts…”
The first few days of the Big East Tournament haven’t disappointed with a host of thrilling games already in the books. Georgetown today dethroned the mighty Syracuse Orangemen at Madison Square Garden 91-84, thanks to a epic 27-point performance from junior forward Chris Wright. The #3 ranked Orangemen were also dealt a potentially crucial blow going into March Madness with Arinze Onuaku suffering an injury to his knee. Last night Cincinatti kept their NCAA Tournament dreams alive by upsetting Rick Pitino’s Louisville Cardinals 69-66. Marquette won two tight games against St. John’s and Villanova to advance to semi-finals with the Hoyas. Even the early game was exciting with Seton Hall outlasting Providence in a game where over 200 points were scored. Whoever emerges victorious out of this year’s Big East Tournament will be riding a emotional high going into the Big Dance. The world’s oldest tennis tournament will be played June 21st - July 4th at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club just outside London. The 124th Wimbledon promises to be one of the most highly anticipated sporting events on the planet this summer. The game of tennis is fortunate to have a bevy of international stars playing in the game currently. The world’s will be at their best on the grass courts of the All England, as Wimbledon is often considered the grandest of all the grand slam titles. Participants dress in white as is tradition while spectators eat strawberries and cream or drinking Primm Spritzers.
I placed two electronics orders this week, one with Crutchfield and one with Amazon.

The Crutchfield order was fraught with difficulty. They asked for some info that Amazon never asked for, and the credit card company gave them trouble. It looked like the order, a TV and soundbar-with-woofer, would be delayed. I said so on Twitter. Even though the TV was a very interesting and totally new product from Sony, and very reasonably priced. Further, Amazon was only taking pre-orders, Crutchfield had it in stock.

At the same time the order I placed on Amazon went through with out a hitch. I praised them on Twitter, and said Crutchfield should try to be more like Amazon.

Heh.

The Crutchfield order, which was far more complex (a 46-inch TV) but not much more expensive than the Amazon one, is complete. And unusually, the Amazon order is lost in UPS hell. It's been "out for delivery" for almost 48 hours. After I paid for 1-day turnaround the best they can offer is they'll refund the $3.99 I paid (how generous of them, he said sarcastically) and say I should wait until the 22nd. Geez if I wanted it that slow I wouldn't have bought it from Amazon.

Sometimes I wonder if they look at their records to see how much I spend with them. It's guys like me that keep them flying First Class instead of coach. Couldn't they arrange a Saturday delivery? Couldn't they call UPS and find out what they did with my delivery?

BTW, I ordered the Fujitsu scanner I wrote up here. It was a total impulse buy. A product I'm paying to review. Nothing more aggravating than an impulse buy that turns into a support issue.
Lists are the cotton candy of journalism--hard to resist, but not very nourishing.

Travel & Leisure Magazine has come out with such a list; it purports to tell us the world's 15 ugliest buildings. Chicago's Harold Washington Library Center, designed by Chicago architect Tom Beeby, is on it, along with Frank Gehry's Experience Music Project in Seattle and Michael Graves' Portland Building.

I've never been a big fan of the Harold Washington Library Center--its classical facade is leaden, its rooftop ornament is cartoonish and its lobby has all the grace of a shopping mall. But one of the world's ugliest buildings? Nah.

The really ugly buildings, as the story accompanying the list says, are the anonymous ones where architects aren't even trying to make a statement. And for what it's worth, the Harold Washington Library Center made the list of America's Favorite Architecture when the American Institute of Architects published the results of a national poll in 2007.
Every March, users all around the world flock to Yahoo! Fantasy Sports to play our NCAA Tournament bracket game, “Tourney Pick’Em.” It’s one of our most popular games.

In many ways, it’s also one of our simplest. Just fill out your bracket by selecting the teams you expect will win. Sounds easy, right? Well there’s a catch — there are 9,223,372,036,854,780,000 different possible ways you can fill your bracket out.

That absurdly huge number presents a challenge for us as well. How do you make something with 9 quintillion possible combinations so easy-to-use that a user can fill out their brackets in just a couple of minutes? The answer involves a fair amount of JavaScript beneath the hood, which we call our “bracket engine”.

The bracket engine we had been using since 2004 had served us well, but after six NCAA tournaments it was beginning to show it’s age. The YUI Library didn’t even exist when it was first written (for that matter, neither did JSON or Firebug). So for this year’s game, we decided that instead of the incremental improvements we normally make, we’d start from scratch. Rebuilding from the ground up gave us the opportunity to completely modernize our bracket engine, so it’s only fitting that we went as modern as we could by using YUI 3. This would be one of the first projects Yahoo! Fantasy Sports has built with YUI 3; but, at this point, we knew that the strengths of the library were too great to pass up. Happily, the new bracket engine turned out even better than we had hoped for.
These white papers attempt to capture and frame the issues and approaches particular to social interaction design (SxD for short). Each addresses a particular aspect of the design of social software. As they were written over the past three years, they progress from theoretical considerations, which drove the first papers, to the more design-oriented topics covered in recent papers.

In the early papers I examine social software sites and online communities whose participation and user experience reflected the closed system character of sites like Friendster.com, MySpace.com, and Tribe.net. In particular, I was interested in the degree to which those sites produced rich relationships and mediated social interactions, including group and cultural dynamics. The later white papers take up social interaction on open systems and include discussions of Web 2.0 elements, navigation, and content organization. In these, interactions and user contributions are bound less by community membership and more by emerging social practices. Clearly, early adopters of sites like Friendster (one could go back to CMC systems, usenet, IRC chats and so forth of the 90s) helped to establish practices that have now been widely adopted by social media in general.

I've tried to identify the "engines" of user participation at work in a variety of thematically-oriented social media systems, including the communication, transaction, social, and economic models behind each. I describe all of these systems as "talk systems," and model the user and social interactions manifest in each on conversation and speech, rather than publishing and writing. It seems clear that the Web's ability to make users visible through their own contributions involves a production of "presence" that leads inevitably to psychological, interpersonal, communicative, and social phenomena that we observe and assign to these systems, but which emerge at the second, not first, order of user interaction. Thus the problem of designing social software is a problem of applying leverage and guidance through the site's information architecture, navigation schema, use of communication tools, presentation of user contributions, and structuring of time (from permanent to fast-fading content). Social interaction design perhaps most resembles that of the urban architect: design, planning, modeling, and execution still cannot (thankfully!) regulate actual use. But walkways, open spaces, landscaping, use of light and surface, perspective and material do of course create context and environment.

The user falls into a relationship with a site's other users, or audience, that sets his or her needs and expectations as much as the software design itself. Hence the importance of moving from a user-centric methodology to one that applies our understanding of communication and interaction as social practices. On social media systems, all action is socially informed. And yet the social cannot be engineered. Hence the importance of understanding and anticipating the social dimensions of activity on these sites.

I hope you enjoy these, and as always I welcome feedback. Upcoming papers will cover recent trends in Web 2.0 sites and services, and directions for the development of future systems. I hope to also post in-depth UI critiques of popular web 2.0 and social media sites.

Watch this and die from hysterical bouts of laughter. Only for those who know Russian. But anyway - visuals are also good. By the way, long time ago I was a  Viseum Ad Agency started this new campaign for Hummer. “Get Out of My Way!” Exactly! I’m not sure who exactly buys Hummers in Europe or the US (Borat?) but in Moscow (judging by their driving habit) they are all blood-thirsty Trolls from Mordor. It’s hard to say as windows are always heavily tinted. This ad was criticized by Russian advertising community for being actually a call for irresponsible behavior.teacher of English and German at a high school numero uno in Onega Arkhangelsk Region (activate your Google Earth). This is one of the most hilarious cartoons I've ever seen in my life. Every bottle of this "Standart" vodka has a small silver coin. Coins are different so one has a chance to become an owner of a good collection. Recommended retail price is 160 rubles ($6.15). I see a man (left) and a squatted woman with a huge hair do (right) who's giving the man a blow job. Prodvizheniye company from St.Petersburg promotes a vodka brand RUS that should be national and local at the same time. It’s label looks like a car license plate with regional codes. If you live in Chita you buy 75 vodka but if you’re from Saratov then you choose 64. Your local chauvinism should prevent you from buying ‘alien’ vodkas. I’m sure St.Petersburgers (78 code) would angrily refuse even to touch 97 vodka (Moscow). But wait! Moscow has at least three codes: 97, 99, 117. Muscovites are already too rich and now they get at least four different vodkas while the rest of the country must be satisfied with only one. It’s unclear to me why all prizes for the most stupid, ridiculous and unfocused commercials in Russia are always won by ramen noodles producers. Take this piece of commercial by Rollton, for example. If you want to win your man give him Rollton ramen noodles. Right! This is a kind of birthday dinner every homeless dreams about.
Talk about a welcome change in narrative. Think back to 2009, and pretty much all the story-lines in women’s tennis were decidedly negative — poor quality matches, Dinara Safina at number one without a Slam and then breaking down under all the pressure. It was an annus horriblis for women’s tennis, summed up by a lack of standout moments — bar Kim Clijsters’ fairytale US Open success. But even that had a flipside, raising the question of how she could win a Slam in just her third event back on tour.  There are more exciting matches and more positive story-lines. Justine Henin is back and has already reached two finals this season, in Brisbane and at the Australian Open. Her Belgian compatriot Clijsters is also playing a full calendar this year and already has a WTA title to her name so far in 2010. Serena Williams has defended her Australian Open crown and remains right where she belongs at world number one. And there is evidence that those who wrote off Venus Williams may have to revise their opinions. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion is on a 10 match winning streak, having won WTA titles in Dubai and Acapulco in February.
England manager Martin Johnson went on to the pitch at the final whistle to question Lawrence about his control of the scrums. “I was just asking him for clarification that’s all,” Johnson said.

“At scrum time he was very quick to penalise, which is fine if we were wrong. But I said that he had to penalise them first time as well. One scrum was reset and then they kicked three points just before half-time and I asked him why he didn’t penalise them as well.

"It doesn’t matter what I think about his performance. He refs the game so his decision is final and that’s fine.” But Lewis Moody, who captained England for the first time in the absence of the injured Steve Borthwick, refused to blame Lawrence.

“There’s no point blaming the referee, it’s our game to win, not his. We have just got to be more clinical,” Moody said.

Ireland’s defeat in their last game at Croke Park before they return to the redeveloped Lansdowne Road ended their slim title hopes and cost them their fifth Triple Crown in seven seasons.

A last-minute penalty from fly-half Dan Parks saved Scotland from the wooden spoon and clinched their first win in Dublin since 1998. Italy, beaten 33-10 by Wales at the Millennium Stadium, propped up the table for the third successive season.

“We came here to spoil the party and we sort of did that. We are delighted,” Parks said.

Scotland’s win was their first in the Six Nations under former England head coach Andy Robinson after near misses against Wales and Italy.

Wales had to settle for fourth place two years after they completed the Grand Slam.
The pending arrival of the 4G wireless technologies, particularly LTE-A but in general even the ‘4G-Lite’ versions of LTE and WiMax, foreshadows a fundamental change for the mobile phone industry.  I’m not just talking about the move to flatter, IP-based architectures, or mobile connections approaching (or exceeding) 100Mbps, or the popularity of 3DTV.  I’m talking about the demise of the mobile plan based on voice minutes.  It is already becoming standard practice for the Operators to mandate data plans with the purchase of the latest smartphones. 

In the next two years we are looking at a 50% growth in phones with Advanced OS (Android, iPhone, Blackberry OS, Symbian S60) which will continue to drive the push for mandatory data plans.  These are data plans with values that can easily exceed the value of the voice plan for the same device.  And they should – for a growing segment of the population, voice usage is dropping dramatically while data usage is skyrocketing (tell me something I don’t know, right?).  So at what point do the voice minute plans become irrelevant for these data-oriented devices and voice-only plans become the entry-level point for the operators for base devices?

Operators could continue to offer ‘voice minutes’ as part of their plan but to what effect?  When voice truly moves to IP, whether it is VoIP via Skype or some other program, just how does the operator actually MEASURE and thus value voice traffic?  A circuit that can be measured in time is no longer set up, packets are sent only when there is something to be transmitted, so ‘time’ as a measure of a voice call becomes irrelevant. So how do you measure the value of the mobile connection?  You COULD still use minutes to measure plan value, but with certain demographics using less and less ‘voice’ and more and more ‘data’ it would seem this is so, well, sooo 2010 and not 2012.  Or soo 2G and not 4G.  I’ll be watching to see how these plans develop.
Upon arriving at the Courtyard Marriott hotel on my recent trip to Toronto, I bypassed the regular line and wandered right up to the “Elite Guest Check-in” desk.

“Checking in for Wesson,” I said, handing my credit card to the front-desk clerk.

The front-desk clerk punched my name into the computer and said. “Yes, Mr. Wesson. Welcome back. You are staying with us for four nights?”

I nodded.

The front-desk clerk continued. “Excellent. We have your Platinum number on file. As your arrival gift, would you like the bonus points, or would you prefer to get something from our Market,” the clerk asked, motioning towards the small shop for snacks and drinks.

“I’ll take the points,” I said. I smiled to myself and thought, “That’s another two-hundred and fifty more points towards my goal.” At Home In Airworld

"I live somewhere else, in the margins of my itineraries. I call it Airworld; the scene, the place, the style. My hometown papers are USA Today and the Wall Street Journal. The big-screen Panasonics in the club rooms broadcast all the news I need, with an emphasis on the markets and the weather. Airworld is a nation within a nation, with its own language, architecture, mood, and even its own currency - the token economy of airline bonus miles that I've come to value more than dollars."
- Up In The Air, (book) Walter Kirn

I went this past weekend to see the new movie Up In the Air, based upon a book which I had previously read by Walter Kirn. In the movie, George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a corporate down-sizing consultant who spends much of his life travelling for work. Though Bingham has an apartment in Omaha, he feels more at home in “Airworld” – literally “up in the air” on the airplanes and on the ground in the airports, hotel suites and rental cars that make up his travelling life. Bingham has a goal, one he is slightly embarrassed to admit at times. It is to join the elite group of American Airlines customers who have amassed 10 million air miles.
The Carolina Chocolate Drops are a trio that brings back the tradition of old-timey string band music and takes it into the 21st century. The group has three members: Rhiannon Giddens, Dom Flemons, and Justin Robinson, who sing, and play banjo, fiddle and percussion and met in North Carolina in the early 2000's. The group uses old time folk tunes and reels as jumping off points to their own musical conception. "Hit 'em Up Style" shows this well, by taking what could be a modern sounding soul and R&B tune about revenge for infidelity and putting Rhiannon's strong and sassy vocals in front of a swirling raw toned fiddle. The effect works well, as does the more traditional sounding work like "You're Baby Ain't Sweet Like Mine," with some deft kazoo work emphasizing the double entendre nature of the lyrics and "Cornbread and Butterbeans." "Snoeden's Jig" is a nice centerpiece for the instrumental work of the band, while "Reynadine" is a beautifully haunting a capella performance. This album is a little on the short side, clocking in at about an LP's length, but it feels right. There's nothing contrived about the music here, whether it is a remake of a traditional song or an original composition, the group plays with strength and conviction throughout. Moreland and Arbuckle - Flood Moreland and Arbuckle are Aaron Moreland on guitar and Dustin Arbuckle on harmonica and vocals. They play a high energy roots rock/blues that is akin in some ways to The Black Keys. The music hews closely to the blues but plays them in different styles, uptempo blues rock with the help of drummer Brad Homer really pulsing and pushing the music along like on the opener "Hate to See You Go." They play a blistering electric version of "The Legend of John Henry" which weds the folkloric narrative of the to a blasting roadhouse beat. The band mixes in some nice soulful numbers and acoustic blues for a well rounded sound. Fans of roots Americana music and gutbucket blues will find a lot to enjoy. First class straight ahead mainstream jazz from Mike LeDonne on Hammons B3 Organ, Eric Alexander on tenor saxophone, Peter Bernstein on guitar and Joe Farnsworth on drums. Just like they say on the tin, the first four performances are uptempo groovers with strong rich organ and deep swirling tenor saxophone. "Deep Blue" slows down to slow ballad tempo with washes of organ and patient probing saxophone. "Sunday in New York" is a medium tempo groove with a nice patient guitar solo and rolling organ feature. "Bopsolete" is fast paced bebop with Alexander taking a rapid and accelerated solo. LeDonne keeps the organ bubbling fast then makes way for a hot drum solo. The standard "On the Street Where You Live" has a nice flowing guitar solo and a soulful saxophone interlude. Listeners with tastes for organ and tenor work along the lines of of the template Jimmy Smith and Stanley Turrentine laid down in the 50's and 60's will be happy with the music here, it is consistently played at a high level.
"My comments about movie theaters aside, I'm going to see this. I don't like the trailer. But I do like Queen Latifah. And I love the Negroes at Court Street in Bk. (""Bitch got thrown! Bitch got thrown!!"") I actually troll the bad black rom-com DVDs in search of half-decent material. Every once in a while you come with a goodie. Breaking All The Rules is really underrated. And the world will not be truly postracial until you see a flick like The Seat Filler is in theaters, and The Ugly Truth is straight to DVD. There's a good convo going on below about my post earlier this week on Ben Roethlisberger. I think the take-away, for me, is that this a post that should have stayed in my head, and off the page. We all have our musings, and the kind of conversation we might have over beers with friends. But That's very different than posting something on the Atlantic's website.

For me the salient facts are as follows: I have no idea what happened, and in such an instance, it's almost never a good idea to start publicly riffing. Rape is a serious accusation, and a kind of crime that presents a specific problem to those who like to bat these kind of things around. I'm not convinced that my contribution to the conversation--absent of any real facts--actually helps anyone, or clarifies anything

Look, I'm a football fan with a particular curiosity about the justice system. This case obviously appeals to my interests. But, on reflection, I don't think I had anything of substance to add. There are limits to living in your own head. Likewise, there are limits your ability to discern between your occasional thoughts and writing with substance. I failed on that count here. 

While we're in full apology mode, I've been informed by a couple people that ""Streisand"" is actually an old-school homophobic slur. This highlights the importance of only riffing off jokes that you actually understand. My apologies to all. I would change the post's title. But that feels deceptive.

Anyway, I'm leaving comments off. I think that's enough meta analysis and navel-gazing for one day. Let's not make worse. I think I have some sense of why this whole conversation might be frustrating. Rape has a psychological element that thrives on shame. In our justice system the burden is always on the accuser, but that burden falls especially hard when there are significant disincentives to reporting the crime, and testifying about it. Sexual assault is humiliating, and no one really wants to relive that humiliation. Moreover, I think getting accused of sexual assault twice raises some basic human suspicions. 

But that said, I'm not exactly sure what to do here. I think we all find the presumption of innocence to be essential. With that in mind--What, specifically, should we be saying? How should we be talking about the anonymous accuser? What, specifically, constitutes taking alleged sexual misconduct seriously? Should we really be in the business of denouncing ""alleged crimes?"" Was the rush to condemn in the Duke Rape Case excusable?"
Yes, that’s an unabashed cop from the Barney Stinson playbook, but given the film in question, we’re pretty sure he’d approve, especially since among the plot keywords listed for “Bitch Slap” on IMDb are such gems as “breasts,” “sex,” “stripper,” “beautiful woman, “female nudity,” and – wait for it – “lesbian scene.” Mind you, you also get “non-linear timeline,” “nun,” “Tourette’s Syndrome,” and “yo-yo,” but let’s not lose our focus here. Here’s the two-sentence summary of “Bitch Slap” that’s been floating around the internet:

When three curvaceous babes arrive at a desert hideaway to steal over $200 million from an underworld kingpin, things quickly spiral out of control. Allegiances are switched, truths are revealed, criminals are unmasked and nothing is quite what it seems as the fate of the world is precariously balanced among this trio of sexy femmes fatales.

“Bitch Slap” is definitely an acquired taste, with its attempt to offer up a tongue-in-cheek version of the kind of motion pictures that are virtual parodies to begin with, but if you approach it with the right mindset, it’s a laugh riot. It also looks gorgeous, and that’s even when the aforementioned trio of curvaceous babes aren’t on the screen, but when they are…? Look out.

Bullz-Eye had a chance to chat with one of those lovely ladies – Erin Cummings, who plays Hel – in conjunction with the release of “Bitch Slap” on DVD…and when we did, you can bet we made sure to ask her about as many of those plot keywords as possible.
Inside the BPA Group at Forrester, we conducted a little experiment. I suggested that we should collaborate on a piece about the Pega acquisition of Chordiant. What followed was a large number of email exchanges. I drew the short straw in bringing all these thoughts together into a coherent whole. I prepared a document for Forrester clients to explore the acquisition in detail (probably getting through the editing process next week some time), and this blog post is culled from that document. So while the blog post bears my name, it reflects the collective opinions of Connie Moore, Bill Band, Natalie Petouhoff, John Rymer, Clay Richardson, Craig Le Claire and James Kobielus. Of course, I have put my own interpretation on it too.

Pega definitely wants to be in the customer experience/customer service business, and they want to get there by having a very strong BPM offering.  It is not that they are moving away from BPM in favor of Customer Experience – they’re just strengthening their hand in CRM (or CPM as they would call it), more forcefully making the connection. We already knew this, but the Chordiant deal just reinforced that point (see related research doc from Bill Band in 2005 !!). This is not a new direction or change in direction for Pega, it is a strong move that takes them faster in the direction they were already going.

From a product point of view, Pega are adding/strengthening their hand – Choridant’s marketing automation and predictive analytics seem to be of greatest interest. Of course, Pega also values the engineering talent that Chordiant has, and will redirect those people over time to work on integrating these capabilities into the BPM offering. They were also interested in the vertical industry and functional expertise that Chordiant had to offer.
The British Airways strike has dragged up from our collective memory recollections of dismal days of endless walkouts, go-slows, blackings, picket lines and tea and sandwiches at No 10. Back in the 1960s and 1970s the unions were throttling our factories, public transport, schools, hospitals, power stations and even our cemeteries. These days, along with British Airways, we’ve got the threat of rail strikes over Easter and the prospect of 200,000 civil servants walking out on Wednesday to celebrate Mr Darling’s Budget.

I thought we’d swept away all that nonsense with Margaret Thatcher’s trades union reforms. These were drawn up to protect workers from being intimidated into strikes and to prevent unfair industrial action by threatening the unions with fines. When drafting them, I drew on my own experience as a trades union activist and on the knowledge that, while much of the industrial disruption which had brought down both the Heath and Callaghan governments was politically motivated, not every strike is an act of mindless aggression. Not all strikers are greedy, lazy, strike-happy shop-floor workers, nor were all strikes plotted by the cloth-capped colonels of the TUC in pursuit of a coup d’état.  There are moments when reasonable workers clash with short-sighted, arrogant, incompetent or frightened managements and, in despair, they simply walk off the job. It is important that ministers understand that fact. I certainly did, because in my time I had been both a striker and a blackleg.

There is an element of obduracy to the BA strike, and it runs the risk of becoming a suicide pact between the airline and its cabin staff. If this were to be the case, then I am sure that the unemployment and losses invoked would be regarded by the apparatchiks of Unite as “a price well worth paying” in its bid to rule the political and industrial roost.

However, the real danger from the resurgence of industrial mayhem will not become clear until after the general election. Whether Cameron outloses Brown, or Brown outloses Cameron (for neither is likely to postively win the support of the electorate, although I suppose the wife of one or the other could), whichever of the two men finds himself in No 10 will have no choice but to tackle the massive public debts incurred over the past 13 years of Government waste.
It has become a Wine Talk column tradition that following every Monterey Wine Competition since its inception in 1994 I devote part of an ensuing column to selected value gold medal wines.

The 17th annual Monterey Wine Competition was staged March 6-7 at the Salinas Valley Fairgrounds in King City, CA. Here are the highlights from this week's nationally syndicated Creators Syndicate Wine Talk column:

EOS Estate Winery 2007 French Connection, Paso Robles ($18) — This red Bordeaux-style blend from the up-and-coming Paso Robles region is a steal in this price range. It was nominated for the sweepstakes round of voting for Best of Show, and thus was elevated from gold to platinum.

Ventana Vineyards 2007 Rubystone, Arroyo Seco ($18) — Another gold that was elevated to Platinum as a result of being nominated for Best of Show consideration. This red Rhone-style blend is heavy on the Grenache, which lends a pure red-fruit aroma profile. The scent of white pepper is unmistakable and very sexy. The previous vintage of Rubystone also earned gold and made it to the sweepstakes of the 2009 Monterey Wine Competition.

Castello Banfi 2008 Centine Bianco, Toscana ($12) — This blend of Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay is a sensational everyday white, delivering refreshing and complex flavors at a low, low cost.

Lava Cap 2007 Barbera Reserve, El Dorado ($18) — The wines of California's Sierra Foothills aren't the easiest to find, but they are certainly worthy of the effort to seek them out. This one's great for grilled meats with savory seasonings or with flavorful pasta dishes.

Little Black Dress 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon, California ($11) — It's a feat to be able to tantalize the taste buds with a mass-produced commercial Cabernet, but Little Black Dress pulls it off consistently. If you're on a tight budget, this is a great Cab for the money. PS: At the same price, the Little Black Dress 2008 Chardonnay also earned Platinum!

Villa San-Juliette 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon, Paso Robles ($15) — Dollar for dollar perhaps the best value in red wine I encountered at this year's Monterey competition. The winemaker, Adam LaZarre, is a rising star and his wines at Hahn Estates, his previous stop, were stellar over the better part of his decade there. This one was elevated to Platinum by virtue of its presence in the sweepstakes round.

Fleur de California 2007 Pinot Noir, Carneros ($17) — You simply don't find many gold medal Pinots for less than $20 a bottle. Or even $30 a bottle. So this wine stands out on the merits and the price. Get it while it lasts.

Fish Eye 2007 Pinot Noir, South Eastern Australia ($7) — See the above!

Jefferson Vineyards 2008 Petit Verdot, Virginia ($19) — I realize this wine from southern Virginia will be nearly impossible to source unless you are visiting the Charlottesville area for some reason, but I mention it because the panel that judged it loved it, and one even pegged it for a Virginia wine.
Its inaugural programme will see productions exploding like party-poppers around the country over the coming year. The range of work promises to be consistently attention-worthy, whether it be a new play about the Bridgend suicides, a forgotten early drama by John Osborne, or a major revival of The Persians by Aeschylus. As for locations, few travellers’ guides could offer such an adventurous variety: audiences will be invited into miners’ institutes in the Valleys, on to the beaches of North Wales, into a replica village on a MOD firing range in the Brecon Beacons, somewhere in Snowdonia, all across Port Talbot. Stick a pin in a map and something theatrical is almost certain to be in the offing there.

In fact, the only obvious locale that hasn’t been commandeered as a site-specific venue is a disused colliery. “Don’t worry,” John McGrath, NTW’s energetic and articulate artistic director assures me as we pace the rain-sodden high street of Blackwood, a small town in the South Wales Valleys where the first production is about to be unveiled. “We’re already having discussions about that. Would we try and take people down a mine? Absolutely! But we’d do it in an unusual way.’

Born in Wales but raised in Liverpool and hence regarded as an outsider, much in the mould of the NTS’s English director, Vicky Featherstone, McGrath shows such obvious devotion to the cause of giving NTW a big-splash start that it feels churlish to ask: does Wales need its own national theatre? In fact, you could ask: does it need a second national theatre? Because, unnoticed by many, a dedicated Welsh-language company, Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, was launched in 2003.

A former Eng Lit student at Oxford, where he first started to direct before honing his craft in Poland, then New York, and latterly Manchester, which saw him build an experimental buzz around the Contact Theatre, McGrath, 47, reflects: “If you’re going to have national theatres, theatres that enable countries to think about themselves, then Wales needs one. You could just put more money into touring, but that wouldn’t have the same effect. The word national focuses everyone’s minds. With Wales, there’s an added complexity surrounding language. There was a feeling that Welsh-language theatre needed a scale it hadn’t had the opportunity to work on before. After that the question was: what about English language theatre, given that English is a language virtually everyone in Wales shares?”
A DIRECTOR is preparing for a homecoming as his comedy arrives in Manchester today.
David L. Williams’s British comedy Beyond the Pole kicks off its first north west airing at the Cornerhouse cinema.
The film was both directed and co-produced by David under the company he runs with real-life partner, Cold Feet and Friends star Helen Baxendale, who also stars in the movie.
David, 39, said: “I’m really chuffed this film is being showed in Manchester, it is like a homecoming.”
Though raised in Sale, David now lives in London with Helen and their three children but still has friends living in Urmston.
The couple founded Shooting Pictures in 2000.
Their latest offering tells the story of two pals played by Green Wing’s Stephen Mangan and comic actor Rhys Thomas who venture out to the North Pole on the world’s first carbon neutral and organic expeditions.
But the pals, whose idea of facing the extremities is camping in the Pennines, are in for a shock as they face challenges from angry polar bears to cocky Norweigans.
Beyond the Pole may be facing tough competition at the box office from the likes of Scorsesse’s Shutter Island and Matt Damon starrer Green Zone but it has already won a cult following on social networking site Facebook, gaining 5,000 fans, and awards at the Ft Lauderdale International Film Festival.
Describing the 14-week low budget shoot in Greenland, David added: “We shot it at a hunter’s village which had around 300 residents who were all armed to the teeth – they actually turned out to be very friendly.
“We also had to be armed because of the polar bears – it’s difficult when the bears are around and you have to have one more take because the actors need to be a lot more funny.
“It was a tough shoot but a beautiful place to film. ”
Beyond the Pole runs at the Cornerhouse from March 19 to 26.
Flights from London to DC via Frankfurt (don't ask why, just learn from my mistake and never do it) put the recent Atlantic and New Yorker profiles of Tim Geithner in a good light. Longer than they needed to be, you say? I was wishing they were longer. Josh Green was better on Geithner's character, I thought, and John Cassidy more at home with the economics. Both pieces are well worth reading, regardless of your itinerary. But I have to say that neither really dispelled for me the big mystery about Geithner, which is the nature of his professional and intellectual relationship with Larry Summers. When the appointments were first made, I foresaw trouble.Flights from London to DC via Frankfurt (don't ask why, just learn from my mistake and never do it) put the recent Atlantic and New Yorker profiles of Tim Geithner in a good light.

Both pieces are well worth reading, regardless of your itinerary. But I have to say that neither really dispelled for me the big mystery about Geithner, which is the nature of his professional and intellectual relationship with Larry Summers. When the appointments were first made, I foresaw trouble. Like many others, I assumed that Obama would have wished to make Summers Treasury Secretary, but recoiled at the difficulty of getting him confirmed. So Summers became chief economic adviser while his former subordinate Geithner (whose confirmation turned out to be no stroll in the park either) got Treasury. A hazardous arrangement, I thought, though possibly workable, if Geithner was sufficiently self-effacing to accept the  de facto number two position. Summers, I reasoned, never would. But if Geithner decided he was going to be in charge, there would be a fight for influence, the economic message would be muddled, and the loser would have to go. Adding to the danger was the milling profusion of other top economic talent-Volcker, Orszag, Goolsbee, to name just three-in or around the White House. This setting reminded me of the fight between Nigel Lawson, the brains behind the Thatcher Revolution, and Alan Walters, Thatcher's favorite economist, in the late 1980s-a calamity I watched at close quarters. Lawson was chancellor of the exchequer when Thatcher brought Walters into 10 Downing St as her personal adviser. They disagreed about monetary policy; after a period of friction Lawson decided he was no longer trusted to do his job, and quit. You could plausibly argue (and many did at the time) that this was the beginning of the end of Thatcherism.
Islamic banks have been operating like other traditional bank about four decades. They also mobilize deposits and produce loans based on Islamic Law (Shari'ah), which are different from the other conventional or commercial banks. Therefore, Islamic banking differs from conventional banking in several ways, such as the prohibition of transactions based on interest rate and the requirement that bank's operations be carried out according to certain procedures through the use of certain financial instruments (1). However, the Islamic bank can also offer products and services which are similar to those offered by a conventional bank.  Generally, we can define the Islamic bank as a non-interest based financial institution which complies fully with Islamic Laws and has creative and progressive financial engineering to offer efficient and competitive banking, investment, trade finance, commercial and real estate financing services (1). There are approximately 180 Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions operating in Asia, Africa, Europe and the USA with more than 8,000 branches with an estimated $170 billion (2).

The popularity of the Islamic banking system is not limited to the Islamic banks only. Increasingly large international conventional banks are showing interest in the Islamic banking system as well (2). The consequence of this is that Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries are faced with strong competition not only from Islamic banks but also from non-Islamic rivals (3). When competition intensifies and when banks start to offer more or less similar products and services, it is the customer's satisfaction that can influence the performance of an Islamic bank and determines its competitiveness and success. Hence, it is of paramount importance to assess the degree of customer satisfaction towards Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries.
Scheduling meetings is tough, but rescheduling is even harder. We all know how frustrating it can be to try to find just the right time that accommodates everyone's availability and preferred working hours. Throw in different time zones and conference rooms and it goes from painful to excruciating. We'd rather schedule dental appointments.

On the Google Calendar team, we've noticed that when people talk about scheduling they say things like "I'm trying to find a time" or "let's search for a new date." We wondered what would happen if we treated calendaring more like a search problem. Just as Google search applies ranking algorithms to return the most relevant results from the web, we hoped we could rank meeting times based on criteria important to the person scheduling the meeting. Today we're launching the result of that experiment, a gadget called Smart Rescheduler, in Google Calendar Labs. Once you enable the Lab, you can find a new time for an event simply by clicking on a link. Our schedule search algorithm will return a ranked set of the best candidate dates and times based on the calendars others have shared with you. You can read more about it on the Gmail Blog.

So next time your boss says "We need to reschedule," just smile and say "I'm feeling lucky."
Another groundbreaking medical procedure. The teabaggers are spot on that socialized health care never produces anything good and is a complete failure. Every good teabagger knows that the US health care system is the best in the world and nothing else is even close. Provided you ignore all of the advances, of course. When faced with examples of advances, the key is to simply re-state "the US has the greatest health care system in the world" louder or maybe write that on a poster with a picture of Obama as some evil character. That'll win 'em over every time. Not so surprisingly, they have discovered gaps in regulation. Imagine that. Business was allowed to do whatever they wanted during the Bush years. Self-regulation and all that nonsense failed yet another industry. Glad to see they're serious about this. Glad to see the attempts to block this video by Nestlé were defeated. Like the countless stories in recent years ago lead in toys or other harmful products introduced along the supply chain process, Nestlé is being targeted by Greenpeace because of the alleged ties to a company that is destroying the habitat of the endangered orangutan in Indonesia. Nestlé probably did Greenpeace a favor in making this an even bigger story by trying to use their legal team to stop the video. Remember, it's the best and brightest who go to work for these big corporates. Read More......
I gave a talk at the New Museum in New York City on Saturday, along with Omar Wasow, the co-founder of Black Planet. It was good fun – Omar and I are nerds of the same generation, and as he showed slides of his beloved VIC-20, I found myself throwing devil horns in a gesture of 8-bit solidarity. The talk was… sparsely… attended. Which is to say, the two friends from Global Voices who came to support me represented a third of the paying audience. And while this can be a bit dispiriting, Lova Rakotomalala was kind enough not only to attend, but to videotape the beginning of the discussion, which is now posted on his blog. (For those of you who can’t get enough video of me – and, frankly, you should seek professional help – Saturday’s talk was descended in part from my Berkman talk on mapping infrastructure and flow, available here.) And the conversation Omar, Lova, Solana Larsen and others had afterwards at the museum, and later over drinks, made for an extremely rewarding seminar experience, if not the grand NYC lecture I might have been hoping for. Anyway… the talk tried to draw a line between the idea that we should study what people actually do online, rather than what we might hope they would do, to the phenomenon of social translation. As I put slides together, I kept coming back to a talk Zhang Lei gave at the China Internet Research conference. He was making the argument that, while Chinese-speaking internet users may now represent the largest group of internet users, there’s probably much less Chinese-language content than English language. As Lei admitted, we don’t really know that this is true, however. It’s really hard to get an answer to the question, “What percent of the internet is in English? In Chinese?” Near as I can tell, the last time anyone made a serious, rigorous attempt to answer the question was a study by Excite AtHome in 1999, which looked at 600 million webpages and concluded that 72% were in English. (If I’m wrong and missing the obvious, definitive study, please let me know in the comments – would love to know about it.) I haven’t found that study, but it’s referred to in an excellent piece in the American Prospect – “Will the Internet Always Speak English?” – and might be part of the study announced here, which looks at a wide range of research questions around a corpus of Excite data. If Excite’s estimates were right, and the Internet was 72% English in 1999, it’s probably much less so now – in the past decade, the ITU estimates that internet penetration has almost tripled, and much of this growth has been in countries where English isn’t the predominant language. The rise of read/write web technologies like blogs have made it far easier for people to author content in their native languages. While the NITLE blog census, last updated in 2003, saw English, followed by Catalan (?!), as the dominant languages in the blogosphere, Technorati’s “State of the Live Web” in 2007 saw English as a plurality, roughly tied with Japanese… and I believe Technorati’s methods missed lots of Chinese blogs and undercounted them. Still,
Diary of a Wimpy Kid" is a likable movie for kids that will make adults chuckle as well because of the movie's key ingredient -- wit. This usually gets left off the To Do list by most filmmakers who aim at young audiences. However, director Thor Freudenthal and multiple writers have retained from their source material -- a "cartoon novel" by Jeff Kinney -- the sly, painfully observant perspective of its pint-sized protagonist. His commentary recalls for most adults our ambivalent memories of middle school, an era over which no one suffers from any nostalgia.

If indeed Kinney's book sold 28 million copies and was translated into 33 languages, then clearly this Fox release has name recognition. So the studio can expect above-average boxoffice results for a PG-rated film. Opening weekend should come in at around $15 million.

Zachary Gordon plays the Wimpy Kid, aka Greg Heffley, who keeps a journal -- don't call it a diary since that's so-o-o-o-o wimpy -- of his middle-school career so that when he is famous he won't have to answer questions about his early years. What he charts is his luckless engagement with a class system more stratified and unyielding than those in medieval times.

It's a world divided among the cool, moronic, bullying and wimpy, where lunchtime seating is rigidly controlled and an invisible list of where one fits in the hierarchy of popularity is carried in every child's head. In his first year, Greg plummets to the bottom of that list.

His problems is that he's conceited, judgmental and error-prone. Plus he's got a friend named Rowley (Robert Capron), who is oversized and seemingly oblivious, if not impervious, to his social standing. Whatever Greg does, Rowley's counteractions will defeat.

Greg's problem don't end there. Greg has an older brother from hell (Devan Bostick), clueless parents (Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris, mostly wasted in negligible roles) and the worst sort of arch-nemesis -- a girl (Laine MacNeill) who can beat him up. Badly.

Then there is the movie's gun ready to go off: A molding slice of cheese, lying all year on the blacktop, that if touched renders that unfortunate student an immediate pariah.

An episodic screenplay by Jackie Filgo, Jeff Filgo, Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah careens from one situation to another to provide an ever escalating series of disappointments for a kid determined win the title of "class favorite" in at least one area of endeavor.

Some running gags run too long, some episodes are less successful than others and many are wholly predictable in terms of outcome. Nevertheless, Freudenthal keeps the pace steady and is surrounded by bright young actors, who are professional enough to pep up even those sequences where the story lags.
"I was looking for my younger self’. Perhaps he is like the man in Chris Marker’s La Jetée, a film that he openly admired, about the mutability of memory. In La Jetée, the man, via the peculiarities of time travel, realises that as a boy he had witnessed his own death. In Miracles, via the peculiarities of auto(bio)graphy, Ballard time travels with the ongoing revelation that as a boy, Lunghua was the map of his future. Miracles, then, reunites his younger self with the older man, allowing Ballard to again see through young Jim’s eyes, viewing his own impending death with detached, yet remarkably clear vision. In 2006 I interviewed Jim Ballard. I was nervous at the thought of matching wits with this towering figure but my anxiety was quickly banished, for he was a charming and generous conversationalist. Although taxed from the recent discovery of the cancer that would claim him, he applied his blowtorch intelligence to everything from CSI and the ‘soft fascism’ of consumer culture to the surreality of having an English queen as an Australian head of state, weaving such cultural flashpoints in among the warps and wefts of a philosophy that has sustained his writing across 19 novels and around 100 short stories. Performing a similar function, but in reverse, his wonderful memoir contextualises some of the darkest and strangest corners of his fiction – as elements hotwired into his life.

It was never easy, perhaps not even possible for Ballard to separate his life from his work. Nominally English, he was born in Shanghai and lived in the expatriate community there before being interned in 1943 with his family in Lunghua, a Japanese war camp. He didn’t see England until he was 16. Accordingly, the Shanghai years, and the squalor and horror of Lunghua, take up almost half of Miracles, an index to its deep psychological fissures. Marguerite Duras once said she only truly recognised herself in her novels, not the biographies written about her. Perhaps Ballard felt the same. Like Duras, who also wrote iterative, fictionalised accounts of her expatriate upbringing in Saigon, he has practised a form of time travel throughout his career, most famously in the 1984 novel Empire of the Sun, reinhabiting his Lunghua memories in numerous stories, blurring the edges in each incarnation, incrementally shifting the background scenery, erasing forever the demarcation between fiction and reality. The summoning of memory is a key theme in Miracles. But it is memory that becomes hopelessly, irrevocably contaminated with the writer’s imaginative life. The sudden death of his wife, Mary, in 1964 takes up barely a page, but Ballard’s dream of her returning to his world to say goodbye takes up considerably more, as does a discussion of his experimental novel The Atrocity Exhibition, which Ballard has said was in part his attempt to sublimate the hurt and anger he felt at losing Mary so unexpectedly. Motifs from Ballard’s fiction bleed into the autobiographical frame, reversing the process set in train by Empire.s"
Georgia absolutely hammered Russia in the European Nations Cup Qualifier, running out easy 36:8 winners.

Both teams had already qualified for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, but the result means that Georgia will play against Scotland, England and Argentina in Pool B, while Russia will face Australia, Ireland, Italy and – most intriguingly – the United States in Pool C.

Full match report to follow, plus news of the Romania Portugal match, but on this performance, it looks like Georgia will be a handful in next year’s World Cup. The British press are reporting that British troops will take part in this year’s Victory Day Parade in Red Square on May 9th. They’ll be joining troops from America, France and, of course, Russia, to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of the second world war.

According to the British Embassy:

    Research suggests that this is the first time British troops have marched on Red Square 

How much research they actually did is pretty questionable, considering that this picture was taken less than three years ago: They’re marching and playing in the first Russian Military Tattoo, also known as the Kremlin Zoria Festival, which took place in 2007. If you look carefully, you can see representatives from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, the Royal Scots Borderers, the Black Watch, the Highlanders, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Corps of Signals. Plus a whole host of military musicians from other Commonwealth countries.

British marching bands were set to attend the second Tattoo, in 2008, as well, but the Russia-Georgia war put paid to that plan.

Much more about the Moscow Military Tattoo here, including links to lots more pictures. Here’s my absolute favourite. This weekend sees Georgia play Russia in the deciding match of the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup Season. Russia have been playing second fiddle to Georgia all season, but Romania’s shock defeat of Georgia last week means that Russia and Georgia are now level on points at the top of the table, and all is to play for.

To add a little more pressure to this match between the two massive rivals (if more was needed between two countries that fought a war only eighteen months ago), the outcome of the match will decide who qualifies in first place for next year’s Rugby World Cup Finals in New Zealand. Both teams have already qualified, but the team who finishes first in the European Nations Cup will find themselves in the tougher World Cup group – which creates an oddly perverse incentive for each team to throw the game.

This weekend also sees a vital matchup between Romania and Portugal – the winner of which is likely to take the third and final World Cup Qualifying spot.

As ever, we’ll have the results for you here on Siberian Light next week.
This amazing piece of musical scholarship must be one of the most sublime pieces of obsession ever committed to print. Edited by Rutgers University scholar and musician (and Coltrane biographer) Lewis Porter, it is the work of a team of scholars and fans to collate everything known about saxophonist and composer John Coltrane. The book is broken down into two lengthy sections, Part One: The Chronology, which tracks Coltrane's life and music from his birth in Hamlet, North Carolina in 1926 to his death in Long Island in 1967. The Chronology tracks recording dates and personnel as well as tours and live concerts, and major events in Coltrane's life. The music is taken in even greater detail in Part Two: The Discography, which lists all known recording sessions and live performances in chronological order. While this would probably strike some as a dry list of facts, what makes this book even more valuable are the anecdotes that the researchers have collected from fellow musicians and from the media. For example, did you know that one evening at the Half Note in 1964 Coltrane wasn't feeling well after the first set of a gig, so he sat out the second set, allowing Eric Dolphy and Albert Ayler, who had apparently been practicing together earlier in the afternoon take his place. Can you imagine! The mind reels just thinking about it. Critic Gary Giddins's reaction to the "joyful, terrifying noise" of Coltrane's band in 1966 is fascinating as well as the re-prints of newspaper advertisements for the band's upcoming gigs. This was a fascinating book to flip through and a very impressive work of scholarship and research this is endlessly interesting for both music fans and scholars.Inspired by the work of the great Duke Ellington, and his combination of horns and reeds, bassist and composer Dave Holland formed an octet to investigate a wide range of musical textures and colors. Anchored by his quintet with Chris Potter on tenor and soprano saxophone, Steve Nelson on vibes and marimba, Nate Smith on drums and Robin Eubanks on trombone, he adds Antonio Hart on alto saxophone, Alex Sipiagin on trumpet and Gary Smulyan on baritone saxophone. The album was recorded live during a week long stand at Birdland in New York City. "Pathways" opens the album with deep baritone saxophone leading the melody. Smulyan solos with the rest of the horns filling in for support. The horns riff hard with vibes accenting before trumpet takes over. "How's Never" has a feature for solo bass before the band kicks in. Hart's alto saxophone digs deep in a strong solo, before making way for a cool vibraphone, bass and drums section and an exciting drum solo. Chris Potter and Robin Eubanks are featured on "Sea of Marmara" with Potter's soprano saxophone shimmering like a golden sunrise and then switching to tenor saxophone on "Ebb and Flow" to take a stirring feature propelled by blustery horns.
From the customer’s perspective, it’s all the same. If it’s provided over the Internet on a pay-for-usage basis, it’s a cloud service. Within the industry, we argue about definitions more than is good for us. Customers look in from the outside and see a much simpler array of choices.

Why is this important? It matters to how we market and support cloud services (of whatever ilk). Yesterday EuroCloud UK (disclosure: of which I’m chair) had a member meeting, hosted at SAP UK headquarters, that covered various aspects of the transition to SaaS for ISVs. From the title, you’d imagine it would have little content of relevance to raw cloud providers at the infrastructure-as-a-service layer. (One of our challenges in the early days of EuroCloud, whose founders are more from the SaaS side of things, is to make sure we bring the infrastructure players on board with us). But in fact, much of the discussion covered topics of equal interest at any level of the as-a-service stack: How to work with partners? How to compensate sales teams? What sort of contract to offer customers? How to reconcile paying for resources on a pay-per-use basis with a per-seat licence fee? What instrumentation and reporting of service levels should the provider’s infrastructure include?
It's hard to look at the DROID without looking at the company which brought the device to life. Motorola: for years the name has been synonymous with... well, disappointment. While the industry-stalwart made cellphones sexy with the RAZR, the days which followed have not been especially fruitful or compelling. Over the past year or so, we've seen Motorola beating its way back into the mainstream through a series of smart plays: first embracing Android as a platform, then shucking off the weight of Windows Mobile and finally bringing some desirable (and high profile) devices to market.

With the DROID, the company has perhaps created its most attractive and intriguing piece of technology yet. Forging an alliance with both Verizon and Google, Motorola has come up with a second compelling reason to count the phonemaker down, but certainly not out, while the other two giants have finally found a seemingly worthy device to position against the iPhone. So we must pose these questions: is this the phone which will catapult Android into the mainstream? Is it the device that will pull Motorola back from the brink? And -- most importantly -- is it the lynchpin Google and Verizon have needed to challenge the leader in mindshare in the smartphone market? After putting the device through its paces, we think we can give you the answers you seek -- so read on to find out!
"Our ship has once again been repelled by sea ice—this time more ominously than before. We now know for certain that we will not reach Larsen B. It's hard to imagine how disappointed these scientists must feel. They've been planning this expedition for three years. Their careers depend on it. The Nathaniel B. Palmer has gone as far south as it can without becoming trapped in ice and now sits in a sheltered apron of sea ice between James Ross Island and Lockyer Island. Most of our scientific targets on the former Larsen B Ice Shelf lie 70 to 100 miles south—beyond helicopter range. Scientists and crew are making plans to use our helos, together with strategically placed fuel caches, to extend our range and leapfrog scientific instruments to the most important of our targets. If it works, it will have been a heroic effort. In the meantime, we're collecting data from yet another dead ice shelf—a lobe of the former Larsen A Ice Shelf, which once flowed out of Swift Glacier on James Ross Island and covered the area where our ship now is. This little ice shelf was last seen alive and well in 1843; by 1945 it had shrunk by half, and by 1957 it had vanished entirely. Some scientists question how substantial this ice shelf really was. A core of mud that our crew extracted from the seafloor sheds light on this. Three feet of sand sit at the top of the core—just the kind of stuff that's vomited forth when ice shelves disintegrate and the glaciers they once supported run out of control like 18-wheelers without brakes. Below the sand sits gray clay—profoundly empty of diatoms or any other sign of life. It suggests that before the ice shelf went, this area spent thousands of years beneath a thick ice shelf that blotted out sunlight and prevented all but the hardiest things from eking out a living. As we sit here in the ice, the seasons are changing, as evidenced by the eroding daylight. During a late summer's Antarctic night we received our first snowstorm. Wind wafted the falling flakes into waves. Several inches of snow gathered on the ship's decks. At 2 a.m. I wandered out onto the bow and recognized true darkness for the first time in weeks. Only the lights of the ship and three flood lamps throwing circles of light onto the wind-sculpted ice. A dozen white-winged snow petrels cruised in clockwise orbits around the ship, skimming inches above the snow, just at the edge of our little snow globe of light. The birds zoomed by our port side with the wind at their backs, then levitated as they turned into the wind, beating their wings hard to regain momentum. I'm told that snow petrels will sometimes follow ice breakers as they crash through sea ice, snatching up hapless little krill that are thrown onto the ice in front of the ship. But with the ship at a standstill, their cavorting seemed a waste of energy in this cold and harsh (if also kind of pretty) environment—it's not as though they were catching fireflies.
Two birds of another kind also inhabited our summer nightscape: two emperor penguins sleeping on the ice, just off starboard. To find respite from predators such as leopard seals, these birds routinely haul out of the water and flop face-first into the snow—where they sleep. Our two emperors looked still and dead, like minor characters in some old western who'd taken gunshots in the back and fallen forward into the dust. The snow formed drifts around their little black bodies. One has to wonder whether this place was throwing us one last taunt as it chased us out of town. Or perhaps offering a quiet moment of consolation. "
As you know, there’s an abundance of horribly written corporate websites out there – with too much back slapping self praise and not enough focus on the customer.

For us copywriters, this presents an opportunity: if you can point out to a company why their website’s copy is ineffective, they might ask you to give it a makeover. Many companies complain about how poor their websites are at generating sales - often weak copy is to blame.

Here are a few classic corporate web copywriting mistakes you might want to point out:

Irrelevant copy that wastes visitors’ time – You know the sort, packed with meaningless marketing clichés – ‘paradigm shift’, ‘modular best of breed solutions’, blah, blah, blah…Copy that’s not focused on the reader is more likely to cause yawns and glazed eyes than people hopping in theirs seats about a product’s benefits.

No structure or call to action – Every page should have an point of what it wants the reader to think or do. Rather than endlessly boast about ‘market leading solutions’, the copy should be creating an image in people’s minds of how a product can solve their problem. As you know, hitting people’s emotional buttons is a time proven way of persuading them to respond to a call to action (which is another key element many corporate web page’s are missing).

Copywriting by committee – In theory, asking people from different areas of a company to contribute to what the website needs to say makes sense. But you then often end up with the website’s copy becoming drowned in track changes and amendments. Yes, getting feedback is important. But it should then be one person’s responsibility to pull all the elements together into a concisely written website page.

Copy pasted from the corporate brochure – People skim read online and have the attention spans of goldfish. So web copy needs to use short sentences, short paragraphs, plenty of subheads, bullet pointed lists and provide succinct, usable summaries. The internet is also a robotic medium. So addressing the reader as ‘you’ and writing copy in an approachable tone can help it sound more human. Ideally, pages should be kept to less than 300 words. You can always use arrows or drill down menus to break up long pages into more digestible chunks.

Hasn’t been split tested – Not sure which headline or call to action works best? Try split testing the page to find out. Google’s Website Optimizer will do the trick.

Too many keywords (or not enough) – SEO is a complicated beast, and has evolved a lot since the days of hidden text and keyword stuffing. But you still need enough words in the right places to make sure Google knows what your page is about. Luckily, there are some great tools out there for finding out whether your copy’s on the right track - SEOBugz is one tool I use regularly.

So, if you’ve got a spare window next week, have a look at corporate websites in your area to see which are making these mistakes to drum up some business.

Any corporate web copywriting mistakes you’d add?
esterday CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) completed a preliminary estimate of the direct spending and revenue effects of the reconciliation proposal that represents one component of the health care legislation being considered by the Congress. The other component is a bill, H.R. 3590, that the Senate passed in December.

CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the combination of the reconciliation proposal and H.R. 3590 as passed by the Senate would reduce federal budget deficits by $138 billion between 2010 and 2019. Although CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period, many Members have requested our analysis of the long-term budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems. Therefore, we have developed a rough outlook for the decade following the 2010-2019 period. We estimate that the combined effect of enacting those two pieces of legislation would be to reduce federal budget deficits during that following decade relative to those projected under current law—with a total effect that is in a broad range around one-half percent of gross domestic product (GDP). That calculation is very uncertain, and the imprecision of the estimate is intended to reflect that uncertainty.

Many people have raised questions about those projections of deficit reduction and similar projections that we have made regarding earlier pieces of health legislation. Their questions often focus either on the uncertainties surrounding the various technical, behavioral, and economic factors underlying the estimates, or on uncertainties as to whether the legislation would ultimately be implemented as written.

Some analysts believe that CBO is underestimating the ultimate costs of the new subsidies to buy health insurance (which could make the legislation deficit-increasing instead of deficit-reducing). Others assert that CBO is underestimating the ultimate savings from changes in the Medicare program (which could make the legislation reduce deficits by more than we have estimated). Certainly, the budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems is very uncertain. However, CBO staff, in consultation with outside experts, has devoted a great deal of care and effort to this analysis, and the agency strives to develop estimates that reflect the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes. As a result, we believe that CBO’s estimates of the net savings that would result from the legislation have a roughly equal chance of turning out to be too high or too low.

Focusing on another area of concern, some observers argue that CBO’s estimates are unrealistic because the Congress will not allow the Medicare spending cuts and future tax increases in the proposals to take effect. CBO’s responsibility to the Congress is to estimate the effects of proposals as written and not to forecast future legislation. However, the agency does try to provide information about the consequences of implementing proposals. For example, our cost estimate for the bill taken up by the Senate in December and our estimate for the House bill last October noted that inflation-adjusted Medicare spending per beneficiary would slow sharply under those proposals. We estimated that growth in such spending under the Senate bill would drop from about 4 percent per year for the past two decades to roughly 2 percent per year for the next two decades; whether such a reduction could be achieved through greater efficiencies in the delivery of health care or would reduce access to care or diminish the quality of care is unclear. In addition, CBO’s estimates have shown that relaxing previously enacted constraints on Medicare spending can add significantly to long-run budget deficits, as we wrote in answer to a question last fall about the effects of combining the House bill with a change in the so-called Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism for Medicare’s payments to physicians.
Every six months or so, Flip Video--slated to be absorbed by Cisco by the end of the year--puts out a new model or two of its popular YouTube-friendly point-and-shoot mini camcorders. Late last year it was the MinoHD. Now, for spring 2009, the company brings us two updated versions of the Ultra: a higher-end model, the UltraHD, which shoots 720p (1,280x720) high-definition video, and a less expensive Ultra, which shoots 640x480 VGA video.

On the outside at least, not much has changed from Flip's first-generation Ultra. But there are a couple of notable differences. For starters, the transflective LCD on the back is bigger, measuring 2 inches, compared with 1.5 inches. The buttons are also bigger and the UltraHD, which comes in black or white, has a sort of rubberized, matte finish that allows you to grip the device a bit more easily.

Most importantly, this model comes with a set of AA-size NiMH rechargeable batteries you can charge in the unit by simply connecting the camcorder (via its trademark flip-out USB connector) to the USB port on your computer. Alternatively, you can swap in a pair of standard AA alkaline batteries if you don't have time to charge. That standard battery backup option is a nice convenience, but there's a drawback: the batteries are bulkier and heavier than the slim lithium ion type built into the MinoHD. So by default you're getting a bigger, heavier camcorder--the UltraHD weighs 6.1 ounces versus 3.3 ounces for the MinoHD. That said, the UltraHD is still pocket-friendly, just not as pocket-friendly as the MinoHD.

One thing we don't like about the new design is the chrome plastic trim on the sides of the unit. It looks good but you'll find your self continually wiping off fingerprint smudges with the soft, velvety pouch that ships with the product. We would have preferred some sort of brushed metal, or a brushed-metal look. Another minor ding: there's an HDMI output on the side for HDTV connections, but no bundled cable. That's not a huge deal, but Kodak, for instance, includes an HDMI cable with the Zx1, which retails for about $50 less.
The Xphone IIm takes the existing form factor of the Xphone II and gives it an iPod-style makeover. Depending on your personal preferences, that's either a canny marketing decision or a cynical bit of cheap design trickery. The silver and grey styling of the buttons and sides of the phone don't sit quite as well with the otherwise glossy white colour scheme of the phone, although again that's a matter of personal preference.

The Xphone IIm is a candybar form factor smartphone that's fairly reminiscent of most of Sony Ericsson's designs, right down to the largish 2.2 inch screen and small button array. Most functions are controlled via the tiny directional joystick that sits in the middle of the phone, in the same style as the Xphone II itself. The major button difference between the IIm and II is the addition of four dedicated function buttons. These are mapped to Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player functions.

The Xphone IIm weighs in at 106.5g with battery and measures 46.83 x 107.76 x 19.58 mm. The real advantage with this style of smartphone over the massed army of iPaq form factor clones is that they'll fit comfortably in any pocket and don't immediately look like a PDA - although that's an approach that does have its drawbacks, which we'll get to shortly.

Features
As a phone, the Xphone IIm is a tri-band GSM phone with GPRS capabilities and Bluetooth connectivity. The whole platform's running on the somewhat aging Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 Smartphone Edition software, which both manages usual phone functionality as well as PDA-style applications. The IIm also features an integrated VGA camera located on the back of the phone.

The supplied application package - predominantly Pocket Outlook and Internet Explorer - isn't that exciting in PDA terms, although at least running on the Windows Mobile 2003 platform means that there's plenty of potential add-on software out there to bolster the phone's capabilities. The trick there, however, will be making sure that you can control said software via the tiny joystick, as the IIm offers no touchscreen capabilities, unlike larger PDA-style smartphones.

Performance
There's not too much that can be said about the IIm's phone performance, as it worked well enough during our testing for both phone calls and SMS/MMS messaging. Our one complaint is a relatively minor one, in that while the phone itself supports Windows Media player, it doesn't support MP3 ring tones; quite how annoying you'll find that is up to you.

As a PDA, the IIm has some distinct drawbacks, centred mainly around the mandatory use of the joystick. It takes quite a bit of use to get accustomed to using the joystick for menu navigation, especially if you're used to touchscreen smartphones. If you're in possession of small and nimble fingers you'll have no problems with the IIm's joystick, but our rather meatier digits found it irksome, especially as it's all too easy to hit the function buttons above it by accident when scrolling upwards. There are also some applications, such as the normally highly addictive Jawbreaker, that work very poorly through a joystick interface.
"Mainly, the New Israel Fund supports groups that work to ensure that Israel remains a democracy, and it surely represents American Jewish values of tolerance, pluralism and diversity, as well as support for Israel as a Jewish state.  I don't think Andrew is necessarily a bellwether on this -- he's a bit too mercurial -- but as a general proposition I think Hounshell has it right. It seems as if many people in the American elite have decided that Israel is just as dysfunctional (and, sometimes, as brutal) as its Arab foes. Americans don't like intractable crises, and the Israeli government needs to understand this (it needs to understand, as well, that young American Jews are less likely to be reflexive defenders of Israel than their parents are).  At the risk of repeating myself (unavoidable on a blog, I guess), it will be risky for Israel to pull out its settlements from the West Bank, but it will be fatal for Israel to remain in the settlements, for moral and demographic reasons.

What Israel needs is a leader who will step forward and say, ""Here is the way things should look,"" and then present an outline for the creation of a viable Palestine. The settlers will go nuts, but that's what they do. Hamas will go nuts, because that's what it does. But Hounshell is right: What is needed is a Rabin. I tend to think that Netanyahu has the potential to be this leader. Maybe it's more a hope than a reality at this point, but only someone from the right can bring the majority of Israelis to the painful compromises that are obviously necessary. And, to make the obvious point, one of the reasons this compromise is necessary is because American public opinion is one of Israel's most important battlegrounds.  Andrew Sullivan's response to Leon Wieseltier's criticism is here. I'm reading it carefully, and so I don't want to comment much at all now. I agree with Andrew that he's not anti-Semitic, as I've written. I also think that, for whatever reason, he doesn't recognize the severity of his language on Israel and Jewish matters over the past year. For instance, he doesn't seem to recognize the implications of his call for the U.S. to impose a military solution on Israel and have the American army forcibly dismantle settlements. In other words, he's opposed to military action against Iran, but he's for military action against Israel. Let me put it this way: This is not how a friend constructively criticizes Israel. And he doesn't recognize, at least from what I've read so far, that his analysis of the Middle East crisis is consistently and rather wildly one-sided. For instance, he recently wrote, ""Without a permanent cessation of such (settlement) activity, there's no way to get the two sides together. But Israel simply refuses to cooperate, as it has refused for two decades in its land-grab."" "
Patrick is a Canadian born designer who at 19 produced his first pair of shoes for Loucas Kleanthous, a Toronto based designer.  Loucas encouraged Patrick to go to design school.  Not one to let his studies get in the way of his education, Patrick, through his partying,  made friends with Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano who were rising fashion stars at the time. Vivienne had him design the shoes for her Clint Eastwood collection in 1984 and designed the shoes for Galliano’s Fallen Angels collection in 1986 and continued to work with Galliano for six years.  I tried to find photos of those two collections but failed.    He designed the prototype for Vivienne Westwood’s shoes that tripped up Naomi Campbell on the Paris Catwalk  in 1993. 

Here are more Patrick Cox shoes for you, via PatrickCox.com. In 2008 he sold most of  his company to “Fast” Eddie Davenport because the recession hit the business hard, then in 2009 there was talk about litigation.  I hope Mr. Cox is able to salvage his company. So I have been idly watching Carey Mulligan, the  twenty five year old British actress, because she seems to have a great sense of style. (Her stylist is Tiina Laakkonen who has a good artistic eye.)  She seems to like Prada and Lanvin, but has been seen wearing other designers too.   I went back a few months to show you what she has been wearing.  She is a tiny, tiny girl, so she has to watch that her clothes don’t overpower her.  I think she has done that. October 2009 wearing a gladiator-ish studded dress from the  Prada Fall 2009  with Prada sandals.  I love the red lips.  August 2010. At the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala wearing Prada from the Spring 2010 line,  shoes fron the same collection.  These shoes have that clear Lucite heel. This is probably the most amazing skirt around.  August 2010. At the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala wearing Prada from the Spring 2010 line,  shoes fron the same collection.  These shoes have that clear Lucite heel. This is probably the most amazing skirt around.  February 2010 at the BAFTAs  in Vionnet dress, YSL shoes.  This is the second Vionnet dress Carey has worn.  She wore a gorgeous red dress  and nude Vionnet pumps on October 2009 for the premier of An Education in London.  Galligator told us abut this design house a few months ago.  Apparently Anna Wintour has taken a liking to Carey.  The story Carey tells is that,  ”Anna said I should wear short for the Oscars. I was like, ‘No that is so not what I had in my head when I was six years old!’ For the Oscars, she went long, even with a train. (I guess not everyone does what Ms. Wintour says.)  She wore a Prada dress with Prada sandals.   The dress got mixed reviews.  I think she looked great.  This is what she wears on her day off.  This photo was taken the day after the Oscars.  Trapeze smock, brown jersey pants and black ballet shoes.  Just the right outfit for Los Angeles.

 It will be fun to what she and Tiina decide for the Costume Institute Gala and Cannes.  It will undoubtably be beautiful.
Y'know, listening to this and thinking back...it doesn't strike me that Alexandra Burke - a self-confessed fan of the badder boy - would be at all pleased if she bought a new dress and her fella failed to notice, would she?

I mean come on, she's a pop star. She went on a TV talent show in order to get constant feedback and praise from the British public every week. The very least she is going to expect from a man is the ability to tell her she looks hot in her new frock. That need for attention drives her every move, as it does for everyone.

Heck, even bad boys like Skepta do what they do partly because they're not supposed to and it makes people look. Or at least, they SAY they do the things they do because of that. There is a difference.

(Here's the video. Oh so THAT'S why they call you a bad boy.)

The key to talking about how much of a scallywag you are and making it appealing for everyone to listen to lies in how much fun you can make it sound. You have to know that what you're doing is not very nice, and kind of half-laugh at how ridiculous you are. It's a skill, and luckily Skepta is very much the man for the job.

Listen to him brag about treating his woman poorly. Does he sound sad about it? No. But does he sound like he thinks she deserves to be treated this way? Also no. This is very important. He kind of gets off on the fact that he's a rotten swine, but at least he knows right from wrong, and as most of it is relayed from her perspective, it's not like her feelings are being totally dismissed.

That said, "I know she knows I know she ain't the one" is pretty harsh. *disapproving fingerwag*

Also, this scores with me because it owes a sonic debt to Underworld's 'Born Slippy', in the chorus. That's always a good thing, but don't tell Skapta, he'll only change it or something, the shameless rogue.
In his collection you can find the tiny Megatron or the Mini Optimus Prime or the micro Starscream.

...and of course they transform. A little cruel LEGO vignette from dbol39. He wrote that he built it for his girlfriend...hmmm don't ask me why. Maybe they broke off or I don't. But it's not to important. Let's see the vig ;) OchreJelly made an amazing LEGO sculpture of the genius Math professor Stephen Hawking. It's so realistic that I didn't need to tell you the name of the model you would instantly know who is it.

Did you know that his book "A Brief History of Time" stayed on the British Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Wowww the proff knows something ;)  These little Pocket Monsters have left their ordinary life for a short time and took a trip to the world of LEGO bricks :)

THX to Amuzu the whole little crew is here: Pikachu, Chimecho, Hikozaru, Wurmple, and the others... Chris Deck has a tone of great Star Wars MINI Models such as an Imperial Star Destroyer, a TIE Fighter, a Death Star or a Droid Starfighter just to name a few. I brought you some of them ;) Have you ever imagined what you get when you xrays a LEGO brick or a minifg? Well Gravitation's medtech friend has been experimenting with it...These are the results: In Japan there's a TV show called Human Tetris. They get bored with playing tetris on the PC, so they play it now in another way (here is a video to see how exactly).

UniqueBuilder got inspiration after watching the show and built this nice LEGO vignette. Guys at BattleBricks.com built a LEGO NXT robot that plays a video game called Wii Bowling. Check out the video to see the robot in action. If you like this little digital mechanism and want to have a same one, here you can find the instructions for building it.
Working for hours on end with a computer is now a fact of life. Whether it's an aspect of your work or whether you use computers just for fun, there are certain risks involved with prolonged computer use. This simple 7 point checklist will help you recognize and avoid the most common problems:

C ontact stress
O rganisation
M onotony
P osture
U ncomfortable environment
T etchiness
E xercise Contact Stress and Computers
Contact stress refers to the pressure that is put on different parts of the body whilst in a relatively fixed position. Wrist and hand problems are common with computers. For example, 'floating' your hand over the mouse for long periods leads to strain on the ligaments in the back of the hand and the wrist. The sensation is not unlike gripping a pen for long periods. Leaning wrists against hard surfaces such as the edge of the desk leads to similar problems.
In recent years, cyber gangs have been careful to spread their operations across multiple Internet service providers, a tactic that makes it much harder for law enforcement and security administrators to track organized crime activity.  But new research shows that gathering data from various places, including anti-malware and anti-spam companies and phishing blacklists, makes it possible to identify dense clusters of ISPs that that appear to be overly tolerant of malicious activity. This pattern was particularly evident in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Researchers from Indiana University at Bloomington and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN, compared the data from a variety of sources that measure ISP reputation from different perspectives.   Security organizations tend to measure online threats differently depending on their geographic location and focus. The study includes information on phishing websites from Phishtank.com and the Anti-Phishing Working Group; botnet data from the Shadowserver Foundation; spam data from Indiana University, Spamhaus, SURBL, and Support Intelligence; and malware hosting stats from organizations such as CleanMX, eSoft, and Malware Patrol. Craig Shue, a cyber security research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Lab, said the group agreed not to name the hosts and ISPs they determined were malicious in return for a look at the different data sets. Shue's employer, as well as several organizations that contributed data, were concerned about being sued for criticizing particular ISPs.
IDEO’s Bill Moggridge made a comment last week after a screening of Objectified that hit close to home. To paraphrase, he said interaction design has become pervasive, that anyone and everyone can be an interaction designer, and so the role of professional interaction designer is (or is becoming) unnecessary.

So, is Interaction Design a dead-end job?

As an expertise, no. But as a discrete service offering or a career path, I say absolutely.

This position has not made me any new friends around the office, but to be clear, I'm not suggesting our profession is akin to flipping burgers at the mall. Instead, it's that interaction design has reached a point of maturity where growth is constrained. I see three major factors behind this and hope that by acknowledging them we can find a way forward.
1: Developers get it
The practice of "interaction design" grew from the need to present software experiences to users in a way that makes sense, meets their needs, is consistent and coherent and "usable" and ultimately desirable. Other actors in the creation of software, from senior management to product managers to developers, had little exposure to these values nor the abilities to deliver on them.


The landscape is much different today. Developers have a much stronger sense of "good" and "appropriate" interactions. Entire development methodologies revolve around delivering value to users by understanding their needs. There are many developers and development-driven organizations with little or no professional Interaction Design involvement making good software.

Modern development frameworks provide a strong baseline for producing interfaces and interactions that in the past required a skilled interaction designer to realize. On iPhone, for example, while it’s certainly hard to produce great experiences, it’s just as difficult to produce bad UI. On the Web, AJAX libraries offer very usable UI patterns right out of the box and greatly reduce the custom design and coding efforts required to build good online applications.

So from the software side, as the level of interaction design awareness and quality continues to improve throughout development organizations, Interaction Designers are no longer as frequently or as heavily needed to bring a successful product to market.
2: Interaction is not an on-screen activity
Another factor is the emergence of more direct input and feedback mechanisms in today’s software-enabled devices. Interaction designers are vital to help translate between human and computer when interfaces are composed of virtual abstractions with no corresponding physical affordances to aid comprehension. As software manipulation becomes more "natural," the work of designing appropriate interactions moves from the screen out to the device as a whole.


Design of physical devices has traditionally been the purview of industrial designers, a profession with its own long history of considering context and user needs to design products driven by and responding to user interaction. And industrial design education today can include much of the same user-centered design training familiar to interaction designers.

So from the hardware side, Interaction Designers are encroaching upon an established discipline with deeper roots and a better understanding of physical materials and human ergonomics.

AOL Inc. has just launched KitchenDaily, a new food property that adds yet another culinary site to its existing portfolio of AOL Food and the blog Slashfood.

“KitchenDaily is designed to help busy home cooks, moms in particular, make smart, informed decisions about food and cooking while also helping to instill confidence in their abilities in the kitchen,” said Stephanie Dolgins, senior vice president, AOL Women’s and Lifestyle Group, in a press release. “We aim to offer real food for real life and want our audience to know they don't have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for speed. Our extensive video series shows our experts making healthy and inexpensive dishes in the same amount of time it would take to get a pizza delivered to their door.”

The site features partnerships with a number of food personalities, including writer Mark Bittman, chef Marcus Samuelsson, and Gail Simmons of Food & Wine and "Top Chef."

Cheryl Brown, formerly of Gourmet magazine, is editor-in-chief, and Megan Steintrager, formerly of Epicurious.com, is senior editor. Gourmet food editors such as Kemp Minifie, Ruth Cousineau and Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez have also been tapped to run the site.
We actually haven't seen any official shots of the Office apps for Windows Phone 7 Series, but now that Microsoft's emulator has been hacked and unlocked, we've got a glimpse of what creating a Word doc in OneNote looks like -- and while there's a high probability that this a super-early version of the app, it's still revealing in how drastically minimal it is. Microsoft says most people just want to make minor edits and leave comments to Office docs while on the go, not make large edits with copy and paste, so we'd expect to see track changes in the final version, but something tells us the main interface isn't going to look tremendously different than this. One more shot and the video with Word after the break -- hit the source for the second vid with Excel.
Sales & IT have a lot in common. The thing that you learn from sales and can take back into the IT world is that every customer is different. Every customer has a unique set of challenges in terms of how you communicate, how you work with that individual company or customer.

To be an effective CIO leader, you must understand the different parts of the various groups you serve. The way you speak to the head of sales is different from the way you speak to the head of operations, the CFO or the head of R&D. In order to be effective leading IT, business transformation and change, you have to understand what various leaders are trying to do within their own business area, align with that, and then communicate the value that IT brings.

If you start talking to the head of sales about IT or operational metrics, they’ll glaze over very quickly. If you go in talking to them about how am I going to help you drive sales, how am I going to help you drive sales productivity or lead management, you’ll have a much better reception than if you go in there and simply say we’re going to implement Salesforce.com and give them a project plan. You need to show them you understand their challenges as well as the value proposition of what IT can bring.

Where a lot of IT guys get hung up is they talk about “the data center is up 7/24” and “I’ve got five nines reliability” or “I can role out projects…” But you know what? That’s a commodity these days. The real value that you have is where you understand a business unit and its key metrics. I’ll just take a real simple example: If you’re going to roll out a CRM project, the sales team, in general, is looking for… well, they’d say it’s really about lead management, it’s about getting my contacts in a single database, it’s about making my day easier. No it’s not! It’s about sales productivity and driving revenue.
The 1980s fashion revival is coming to a close. But the revival on earlier periods, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s, remains popular. So what to do then with the military fashion trend which has proved the stalwart of fashionisers' wardrobes for the past 2 years? Evolve it. Play down the over-the-top glam pieces taken directly from the 80s, and infuse the historical military look with something far more classic, far more relevant to 2010 fashion. Introducing the Autumn (Fall) / Winter 2010 evolution of the men's military clothing trend. The military shape always has been a fashion driven trend for the colder months; but for Autumn (Fall)/Winter 2009-2010 designers such as Gareth Pugh, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Burberry have modified and transformed the combat uniform from the past to the now. Gareth Pugh, with one of the most unusual menswear collections for A/W 09-10 has brought inspiration from the likes of German officer overcoats from the Second World War to the metal chain mail suits that were worn under suits of armour. Movies can also be seen as a heavy influence in Pugh's A/W collection with feathers for shoulder decoration as inspiration from The Crow including the Gothic ripped trousers and black boots and the metallic body combat suit, a similar cut to Christian Bale's costume in Equilibrium. A few short years ago tailored shorts for men were bang-on-trend; we were moving firmly away from the 1990s and a refined cut of short promised a comfy, distinguished, yet wholly less casual look. They didn't make it big everywhere, a bugger to find in Australia I ventured off to Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge for my navy pair from Paul Smith and they've worn beautifully. But for the gent wanting an updated look for their Spring/Summer 2009 wardrobe where to from here? I've spotted this a few times in our street style coverage, and the latest instance comes from Sweden; men pinning their blazers together either as a feature or to give an even slimmer fit. There aren't all that many fashion accessories for men when one considers the sheer volume that exist for women. And of those that do exist, quite often you find that they're heavily associated with a sub-culture or movement that you're simply not interested in associating yourself with. Brooches for men are, however, one of the few men's accessories which can cross the sub-culture divides, are perfect for both Spring/Summer and Autumn (Fall)/Winter seasons, and are slowly making a come-back. Men's fashion trends are few and far between; yes, a lot of women's trends are eventually adapted to the men's market, but if 2010 men's hair trends prove anything it is that classics will always rule when it comes to men's fashion. Unsurprisingly it's no different when it comes to men's suits. Mark my words, Deep-V T-shirts are going to be the bane of men's fashion trends in Spring-Summer 2009.And no, it's not the Viagra. Not that I use it, but if you want some for kicks, give me a call, I know a guy who knows a guy who lives in Springvale. I'm kidding. Anyway if you may have noticed, this colour has been slowly sneaking its way onto the catwalks the last two winters - bright blue that is. Actually, I'm not even sure what hue they're using.
Periodically, I am accused by Hat Blog readers of not being focused enough on my core business. These people argue that I write too much about general ecommerce issues, the Internet, restaurant or book reviews, and the like. The message is "give me more about hats."

Okay, I hear you. My resolution this year is to refocus squarely on our products. I’ll be attending more trade shows around the world, visiting factories, adding hats and vendors to our web site. We’ll add more hat related content too; hats are a never ending story (past, present, and future).

Most importantly, I’ll be adding my two-cents to the design team. In fact, I have already begun. The more heads that are thinking about our products - styling, materials, trimmings, sweatbands, workmanship particulars, size and fit, etc. - the better. Bruce Zales (Jaxon designer) Susan Lee (sur la tete designer) and their assistants do a stellar job, but every additional person attending to this most fundamental aspect of our business brings a different perspective. Our customers come from every walk of life, are every age, live on all parts of the planet, and are both men and women. So, the more diverse our buyers and designers, the better and broader our selection will be. And, there was a time that I did this job essentially myself, so getting back to this indispensable work is something I am very comfortable with. I am enjoying getting "back to the future".

Here are a couple of hats that I’ve recently brought to the party: 1. The Dario Panama Hat: This genuine Panama hat body is hand woven in Ecuador. These unblocked, bigger than usual hats (3 ¾ inch brims) are then sent to Germany where the venerable Mayser Hat Company blocks and finishes the hat to our quality specifications. Quantities are very limited. 2. The Tyrolean Dreispitz: A classic hat that is an icon for the Alpine region of Europe. Dreispitz in German translates to tricorne which refers to the three dents in the crown. 3. The entire Hills Hats of New Zealand line. There are more. Keep checking our New Hats for Men and New Hats for Women pages.

Thanks to those readers who have asked for more hats, more hat information, more hat images, more hat blog postings. You asked for it, you got it. [That used to be Toyota’s slogan - not so good these days (uh-oh, I need to stay focused on my task).]
Seeing as there is a dry, sunny day unfurling right outside my window, Spring can't be far away, and with it the long rumored Netflix Instant Streaming functionality creeps ever closer to Wii owners, and yes, by owners I mean me.

Truth be told, this functionality is far more than a rumor. It was in fact confirmed on the Netflix Blog back in January. Also, of course Netflix streaming is nothing new, having been available for a good long while via computer and a pretty wide array of devices, including Wii competitors Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The question has got to be though, why did this take so long? After all, with literally millions of Wiis having been sold across a very mainstream demographic in less than four years, Nintendo's device would seem the perfect hardware target. It might be that Netflix was bound by exclusivity agreements in these earlier deals, or perhaps it is that Nintendo didn't see video functionality as worth its time, considering the Wii's modest processing power, the overall limited number of titles available via the service and/or that they would not have total control. Along with possibly a little arrogance on Nintendo's part, all of these are fairly valid possibilities. What is certain though is that a large number of Netflix subscribers use the streaming service, not to replace the mail-based primary Netflix service, but as a supplement to it. Myself, I have an Xbox 360 in one room and a PS3 in another, both set up for streaming. Like the PS3, Wii owners will need a free Netflix-supplied disc that must be inserted into the drive in order to stream content. (A Netflix unlimited account of any level and a broadband connection are also required) The disc-in method is much more clumsy than those utilized by the other devices, which either were manufactured with Netflix streaming in mind or were patched with a software updates. Using the PS3 as an example, it is doubtless true that the disc method both adds a little noise to the viewing experience and uses more energy. The Wii is very energy efficient and pretty quiet though, so there should be few issues. In addition, perhaps Nintendo will get a clue and add a Netflix channel to its Wii functionality, which could eliminate the need for a disc down the road. Until then a disc will do fine.
Jane McGonigal has an epic idea: Use the power of online gaming to help save the world. How? Channel the same concentration and focus that people put toward succeeding in games like World of Warcraft into efforts to solve real-world challenges like hunger, climate change and obesity. That last one means we can't spend all of our time in front of a keyboard and mouse. Her game is called "EVOKE."

It's an online, 10-week series of missions and quests that takes its name from an African proverb: "If you have a problem, and you can't solve it alone, evoke it."

McGonigal's game seeks to empower people in Africa and around the world to come up with creative solutions to urgent social problems.

It's collaborative. Players accomplish each mission by uploading blog posts, photos and video. Other players can offer encouragement and extra game powers.

It's all done inside a graphic novel, set in the year 2020, about a secret group of African problem solvers.
"The feeling of boredom that apparently never bothered them before. Its even more apparent in those that have moved away temporarily with no friends or family. Its like they are on a summer break from school. Only difference is the time of summer break is too long or short depending on the individual in question. They seem to be bitten by the summer vacation syndrome. To understand this better, roll back that memory film and pause it during your school days. Summer time was what every one eagerly awaited. But which then started to drag towards the middle and then felt like should never end near the end. No schools. No work. Just relaxation and play. But everyone had a different summer. Some visited their relatives. Some spent days with their friends. Some even attended summer camp. Anything different from the routine of classes. But then sometimes friends traveled when you wanted to play. You got stuck with relatives that annoyed you. Some dreaded that summer camp that they would be attending without friends and no family.
As we grew older the classes became longer and the vacations shorter. We became used to spending time in
the classroom. We enjoyed it actually. So much so that during vacations we missed the countless pointless hours spent with friends. Though you could meet them, it just wasn't the same. Those who genuinely liked work got bored out of their minds. But most generally realised the classroom was the best place to hang out ;). Then vacations just became about catching up on pending things in personal life or catching up with relatives who by now had become less and less frequent equations in your schedule. Then you go onto work and there are no vacations anymore. Its just work, family and friends. But then some of us get that summer vacation. We get sent away from family and friends. Just like that summer camp when we were kids. Its still the same feeling irrespective of your considerable gain in life experiences, its still something that will benefit you but you would rather stick with friends back home. Its still something that presents new opportunities to learn to grow but which also carries the potential of being friendless and boring. But our mind by now is hardwired on how to handle summer vacations. We develop hobbies to spend our time. Make new friends. Just like that summer camp when we were kids. We find things to do that we hang onto for rest of our lives. Sometimes we bump into friendships that too last forever long. But just like summer camps, these phases in life end too. So if you are one of the people who are waiting for it to end it will end sooner than you know. Those who actually flourish in a summer camp situation, well this one is better because it does not need to end like the camps from your childhood. Now onto my second day, it was time to actually enter a few buildings. I already had a lot of outdoor time when it was nice and sunny on my first day."
Todd Haynes, who has already mastered this genre with Far From Heaven, directs and has adapted James M Cain’s novel. Sounds intriguing — and it’s also proof of Winslet’s ability with mature roles. Crawford was 41 when she got her Oscar; Winslet is just 34.

He’s been dead for 30 years now, but Alfred Hitchcock is currently the most fashionable of all film directors.

In Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese clearly tips his fedora to Hitch repeatedly. The Ghost Writer, directed by Roman Polanski, another devotee, positively throbs with Hitchcockian suspense. On April 2, to mark the 50th anniversary of its release, Universal re-releases Hitchcock’s suspenseful horror classic Psycho.

Also released that same day is the curious Double Take, which uses archival footage of Hitchcock (mainly from the set of The Birds). This filmed essay relates a (dubious) story of a meeting with his double, and pauses to contemplate the Cold War, paranoia in modern life and TV commercials from the Sixties. Playful, elusive and mysterious, it’s directed by Belgian Johan Grimonprez. One feels Hitch would have approved.

Could silent film, like 3D, be about to enjoy a surprising comeback? It’s entirely possible. One of the spring’s coolest events is a tour of that creepy expressionist masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1919). It will be screened in 11 cities (starting in Bath tomorrow) between now and early May.

The twist is that a “re‑scoring orchestra” has composed a soundtrack, and play live at all the screenings. They sound unmistakably modern, but capture the film’s disturbing mood perfectly.   Sad news about Kate Winslet’s marriage break-up last week – yet in the wake of The Reader and Revolutionary Road, her ability to snag juicy film parts remains undimmed.

She has taken the title role in Mildred Pierce, a remake of one of the greatest “women’s pictures”, which earned Joan Crawford an Oscar in 1945. This time round, it’s a multi-part series for HBO, with Winslet cast as the single mother with huge ambitions for her ungrateful daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).
Although Kazakh, he addresses us in Russian, confirming our worst fears. Despite attempts to infiltrate this country's Soviet-era bureaucratic system, we never registered our passports. Ironically, it's only now we're leaving that this archaic system acquires a statuesque importance, and it's a "big problem". Our entreaties in feeble Russian for leniency fall on deaf ears. "I speak to immigration police," comes the unyielding reply.

"Surely there's a way we can resolve this now?" Central Asian border posts are notoriously corrupt; here's an occasion when this could actually favour us. "Is there a fine we can pay?"

The angular features vacate their utilitarian casing. "Wait here!" We're left in the narrow passageway where foot traffic lurches between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, entrusted to a young, scrawny soldier who's eager to practise his English.

The three of us stand and wait, jostled amid the constant flow of leathery old women carting frail-looking wooden wheelbarrows of watermelons and jute. In the chaotic sea of cross-border traffic, we've become the flotsam of no-man's land.

As the minutes, then hours, pass, we appeal to our chaperone's humane side, sharing cigarettes before tossing them into the open gulley running alongside us. We tell him where we're from, where we're going, how much we've loved Kazakhstan.

"I think it's better for everyone if we resolve this problem here, no?" I offer tentatively.

Yellow teeth grin. "Yes."

"Perhaps your boss can help us?"

"Maybe. In Kazakhstan it's very difficult." He's eager, but noncommittal.

Eventually, the saturnine boss summons me into an office, warily looking over his shoulder. He calls in our protector, but insists my girlfriend stays outside. This is "man stuff".

Preliminary small-talk accompanies threats to deport us. I nod, indicating my appreciation of this grave situation, and try my luck again. "But surely we can resolve this here?"

Nervously glancing at the door, the boss shuffles his heavy frame in his inadequate chair. "We can register your passports now. But you must pay big fine."

Bingo. "How much?"

He indicates that I should accompany his acolyte to a more secretive room. Evidently, while it's OK for the chief to profit from a healthy bribe, it's not the done thing for him to participate in the negotiations. I follow my new friend into an even dustier office, littered with computer cadavers and paperwork from glasnost days.

"What currency?" I whisper conspiratorially once we're alone, but I'm not quiet enough: "Dollars!" bellows the boss – he's listening through the door.

My friend opens the bidding at $100, I offer $20. We soon agree on $50. Fortune is kind and I have the right note in my wallet – getting change would be inconceivable.

"Vam spa-seeba!" Stony features betray a Machiavellian grin as I deposit the bill into his top drawer. Minutes later, we're through.
Each chart takes an array passed into its data property. For Line and Bar charts, this is an array of Numbers. These two charts are set to autoScale = true by default. But you can set that to false and provide minimum and maximum values. Set showScaleLabels to true to show the max and min values in labels off to the left as in the examples. The labelPrecision property can be used to determine how these are rounded off if necessary. The Bar Chart’s bar colors can be specified with barColor, and the Line Chart’s lines can be customized with lineColor and lineWidth.

In the Pie Chart, you can also pass an array Numbers to data, or you can pass an array of Objects, where each object has a value property, and optionally a label and color property. If no label is provided, the value is used as a label, rounded off again using labelPrecision. If you don’t want any label, pass in an empty string. If no color is provided, each pie slice will use predetermined color values. You can also pass in an array of color values to the colors property to use those instead. If you run out of color values, random colors will be assigned. Sorting of your data needs to be done manually, if you want the slices to appear in order of size. By default, the first slice starts at an angle of zero degrees. You can change this with beginningAngle, which is in degrees. There is no limit to the number of slices you can have, but too many will make the labels overlap. And more than that, you won’t even be able to see the smaller slices. There is no consolidation or hiding of tiny slices. That’s up to you to handle by tweaking your data first.
We’ve added a new cartoonist to cagle.com, Omar Abdallat from The Addustour newspaper in Jordan.  I’m sure Omar’s cartoons will make some of our readers angry as he often draws bloodthirsty-monster-Israel cartoons, which is common fare for cartoonists in Arab countries - but unlike some Arab cartoonists, Omar draws on other subjects too, and he has a nice style that our mostly American audience can easily understand.  (It isn’t easy to find foreign cartoonists that our American audience can understand!) I just got back from a cool editorial cartoonists conference in Colombia last week. I’m an editorial cartooning wonk and it was great fun to go to a conference where I didn’t know the cartoonists. In fact, the Colombian political cartoonists rarely get together themselves and it was interesting for them to meet each other. Bogota is a huge city of about 8.5 million people, full of universities and libraries and a thriving community of cartoonists. Colombian politics are crazy, bloody, complex and difficult for me to digest in just a week of cramming. Colombia is the second biggest country in South America and the third largest recipient in the world of US foreign aid, because of all the drug issues there. The US State Department brought me to Colombia on a speaking tour to attend the conference as the only American cartoonist.
Luxury SUVs have become such a common sight that the notation for the 2010 Acura MDX on our schedule didn't raise much interest around the office. But then we saw the thing. Rather than the somewhat delicate, beak-nosed vehicle of the past, this one's squarish stance and big air scoops made it look like a hardened criminal.

OK, an exterior styling update. Fine. But Acuras have always seemed like upscale Hondas, never embodying the real luxury found in competitive brands such as Mercedes-Benz or BMW. We got in the cabin expecting to find the usual midlevel cabin appointments, but were instead greeted with beautiful wood-grained trim elements and thick leather seats.

Facing us in the center of the dashboard was the usual Acura controller, a large knob that works as a joystick and dial, surrounded by buttons with an LCD above. We weren't thrilled to see the same old maps on the navigation system, strictly 2D with somewhat jaggy resolution showing on street names.


Acura's stack looks cleaner in the MDX than in previous generations.

Given that Acura uses an in-dash hard drive for the navigation system, we can't imagine these older generation maps take up a whole lot of space. Twisting the big knob around to delve into the navigation system's menus, we found the latest Zagat listings for restaurants and one of our favorite features, a database of scenic drives, listed by state.

Entering a destination into the system proved as easy as ever, the proximity of the knob to the screen making inputs seem nearly as direct as using a touch screen. Maneuvering the MDX out onto the route it calculated, we noticed the traffic flow and incident information overlaid on the maps, and dug into the settings to ensure that the car would dynamically change the route when bad traffic cropped up.

The navigation system guided us through city streets, its route guidance enunciating street names, and the MDX proved very drivable. In the madness of downtown streets, where random double-parked cars and road construction require quick lane changes, the MDX's light steering and responsive low-speed acceleration helped us jump the car from lane to lane.

Further assisting quick maneuvering was the MDX's blind-spot detection, which lit up an icon at the base of the A-pillar when it detected a car in the lane next to us. Given the high sides of the MDX, cars in the next lane were often completely invisible. Blind-spot detection is one of our favorite safety features, and it is nice to see Acura employing it in the MDX.


This icon in the A-pillar lights up when a car is in the MDX's blind spot.

During this excursion we had the suspension in Comfort mode, which made it feel like we were driving a waterbed. The car moved along with a slow motion wallow, softening the ride and absorbing the bumps and pits mining the asphalt.

Power on
At a freeway onramp, we hit the gas hard to see how the MDX handled acceleration at the top end. Here, the 3.7-liter V-6 brought its 270 pound-feet of torque to bear, spooling up the car and engine speed, reaching toward 6,300rpm where the horsepower peaks at 300. This engine isn't the most high tech compared with what other automakers are offering, but it does have Honda's VTEC valve timing.

At freeway speeds, the suspension didn't hunker down, and we were still left with the soft wallow. But it didn't adversely affect the handling, either. The steering had the usual slack built in for an SUV, allowing for effortless driving. Since the beginning of this drive, we were eager to push the button on the console that would put the suspension into Sport mode, but restrained ourselves in the interests of testing the comfort setting completely.

We left the transmission in its standard drive mode, too, holding off on using its sport setting until we found an appropriate road. But flicking the paddle shifters on the steering wheel, we noticed the gear indicator showing 6. Acura has finally caught up with the rest of the world, installing six-speed transmissions. At 70 mph, the engine hummed along at a little under 2,000rpm, which should improve fuel economy.

The EPA rating for the MDX is 16 mpg city and 21 mpg highway, not particularly great numbers, but the vehicle does have third-row seating. In our driving, which combined city, mountain roads, and the freeway, we came in at 17.6 mpg.
Felt is a mass of wool and/or fur. It is not woven, but rather pressed and manipulated in a centuries-old process using heat, water, and pressure to create the strongest, smoothest, most water-resistant natural fabric known. Legends abound with regard to its origin. Some claim that St. Clement (the patron saint of felt hat makers) discovered felt when, as a wandering monk, he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet. The moisture and pressure from pounding feet compressed the fibers into crude, though comfortable felt. Others suggest that Native Americans or ancient Egyptians discovered felt by way of fur lined moccasins or camel hair falling into sandals. In fact,, none of these "firsts" is first as scraps of felt have survived since the Neolithic era, 9,000 years ago, making it the oldest form on cloth. [One theory postulates that felt was "discovered" many times and in many parts of the world because its popularity has risen when societies have become poor, cold, and agrarian. As each society became more urban and advanced, felt making subsided or disappeared.]

To the hat industry, whoever invented felt is not as important as the fact that felt hats function well. Hats made of felt are durable, comfortable, and attractive. Felting has evolved to an art in hat making. Each manufacturer closely guards his exact felt making process and formula. I’ve come to understand over the years that what constitutes a good felt hat can be a matter of opinion or taste. For example, the stiff and meaty felt associated with a high quality American western hat is much different than the supple and light fine felt material associated with European hat making. (Think Stetson versus Borsalino.) Both felts require quality pelts and skilled craftsmanship, but with much different objectives.

Not only do the materials (wool, hare, beaver, nutria, etc.) used to make felt vary, but a host of considerations inform the outcome. Some hats are made to be protective and therefore the felt is stiff and heavy. The bowler, in fact, was made for a game warden in 1850 who wanted protection while chasing poachers on horseback. Cowboy hats function similarly . On the other hand, dress hats-which do keep one’s head warm or dry-are typically lighter weight and, in great part, expressions of style and taste. The finish of the felt, as distinct from its materials, can be "silk", or "angora", or "beaver" (not necessarily meaning that the hat contains beaver fur), or "velour", or "suede", or "sponge", or "scratch". Each finish has its own expression and associations. For example, the silk or angora finishes are typically associated with aristocrats and the top hat or homburg style.

Know that the felt hat that you are wearing or about to purchase is extremely labor intensive and is a modern day example of an ancient and venerable craft.
