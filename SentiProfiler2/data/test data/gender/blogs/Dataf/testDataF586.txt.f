House guests this week. YAY for friends who make you giggle! Here is another ironic observation courtesy of Emily Dickinson. Enjoy! A Bird Came Down the Walk A bird came down the walk, He did not know I saw; He bit an angleworm in halves And ate the fellow, raw. And then he drank a dew From a convenient grass, And then hopped sidewise to the wall To let a beetle pass. by Emily Dickinson If I were a one-eyed-one-horned-flying-purple-people-eater," would that mean I am purple or that I eat purple people? You see, I love my job. But there's not enough of it. That's the problem. The economy is still sinking like a leaky dinghy, and my chances of getting even a part-time position with a 401k option is as unlikely as patching that hole at the bottom of the boat. It worries me that I have no retirement. It worries me that I don't earn enough. But then, what if I actually did land a traditional 9-5 job that offered benefits? But, then again, what if I couldn't learn the job? What if the job had minimal flexibility? What if the commute was hell? What if I couldn't stay awake? I would have to accept the position, but what about the kids? They have appointments and therapy and bad days at school. I have anxiety. But I don't want that to get in the way. Truth be told, I love what I do. I feel confident I could do more of it because it's what I know. I know how to work around my neurological challenges and my family's schedule. I know how to juggle priorities. I know how to expand my scope. I'm good at what I do. And I have awesome co-workers. This isn't a new situation for me. As an undergrad, I worked in Disability Services where I provided tutoring. I could schedule my work around my classes. The students benefited. So did I. I took on projects that no other tutor had in the past. My boss was amazing and flexible and supportive. I was motivated. But the job didn't pay enough, and I had no benefits. And then, I graduated. No more job. It was a student position. I've had other awesome bosses since then--understanding and supportive. They knew I was a little neurotic but that my neurosis didn't prevent me from doing my work. They also knew they could depend on me to be creative. Yesterday, I planned to go to a Federal Government job fair out in Stafford. Over 6,000 people turned out. The State Police had to direct long lines of traffic, and the lines at the booths were not much better. In fact, there were lines to get into the building. Not having experience in government, I wouldn't have much of a chance to land a position that worked out for the employer, me and my family. Now I might sound like I'm just being negative, but I'm not. I am being realistic. With all the competition around, who needs another writer, especially one that requires accommodations? I know I'm useful. I read so many poorly written communications that I wonder why organizations don't hire MORE writers and editors. I guess they don't want to spend the money. My perfect job? Write and edit mostly from home. Work flexible hours. Have a shot at accruing sick time, vacation time and a retirement fund. I don't need health insurance. I don't need huge amounts of supervision. I don't need a cubicle. I don't even need full-time. There are millions of people looking for jobs right now, and many are in worse shape than we are. Typically, that would put things in perspective, but it doesn't when I look at our paycheck-to-paycheck existence. And it's worse because I know I am the weak link here. I'm not depressed. I am anxious. I can't communicate this angst to hubby, or he WILL get depressed. I will never give up, because that's not how I am. But I can't get my hopes up, either. Er, anyone else scared? Sound like anyone you know? Caper Literary Journal publishes quality prose and poetry. I stumbled upon an archived piece that really struck me, especially considering our poor economy and the rise in the numbers of poverty stricken. Jame G. Piatt starts "A Letter to a Teacher" like this: Dear teacher: Do you know I can’t see the board from the back of the room because I need glasses, but my mom can’t afford to buy them? I really want to learn those important things you write on the board, but I am afraid to sit in the front with all of your good kids. Be sure the read the rest. This isn't just a message for teachers. It should be a billboard on the Interstates. How about a little more understanding?

But no one listens.” “Wal-mart says they only use eco-friendly products. But their light bulbs aren’t.” “We don’t need any more houses. Why can’t they just stop building?” Mangy magazine pages and bread bags claim our bony trees, last year’s Robin’s eggs decay, a deck peels five years of paint, windows need replacing. My children’s retro music condenses on the glass: “Oh we’re never gonna survive.” --Katherine M. Gotthardt I would be remiss if I did not address the Bob Marshall incident on my own blog, particularly because Bob Marshall is my Delegate in state government; I have disabilities; both my children have disabilities. Marshall made the following comments regarding children with disabilities, implying that they are "punishment" for women who have had abortions. As stated in the Gainesville Times, here is the full quote, which Marshall conveniently leaves out in his “explanation” which is posted on FOX online: “The number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion w ith handicaps has increased dramatically. Why? Because when you abort the first born of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children,” said Marshall, a Republican. “In the Old Testament, the first born of every being, animal and man, was dedicated to the Lord. There’s a special punishment Christians would suggest.” There is no doubt about it–he is “suggesting” women are punished with disabled children. Look at the juxtaposition of the words he used. Apparently, in his world, God takes his wrath out on children and mothers, whether they have had abortions or not. Marshall is trying to say that's not what he meant. I say he is full of shit. If Marshall wanted to address the issue of state funding for Planned Parenthood, which does provide abortion services in addition to other reproductive services, then that is what he should have addressed. Instead, he took what he deems the word of God and used that to condemn all women with children who have disabilities. In doing so, he condemns anyone with disabilities. In an astounding attempt to redeem himself, Marshall tries to explain the evils of Planned Parenthood by attacking minority communities: "“Thank you very much for coming here today. We are dealing with an attempt to defund , frankly, a malevolent organization. And I say that because you know people by their fruits. In 1960, 65, the out of wed-lock birthrate for blacks was 25 percent. I think it was about 23 percent in 1960 – it was 5 percent for all races. Now it’s 40 percent. It’s 72% for blacks, 51% for Latinas. These are the fruits of planned parenthood. OK. Nothing else. More heartache. More guys who are completely irresponsible and think that women have one function and one function only for a few minutes. OK. But this just isn ’t affecting our families, our inner cities, our communities and our state. This poison animates a world-wide population control program that the United States funds and which is unnecessarily making us enemies overseas. We are attacking traditional family structure in a way that no country should be doing." So now, Marshall targets minority communities and blames PP for the demise of the impoverished and vulnerable. Now let ME clarify I do not believe abortion should be publicly funded; I believe abortion is a moral, medical choice that no woman should ever have to make--not a governmental issue; I believe in education and prevention; I believe some reproductive counselors promote abortion; I would never condemn a woman who has had an abortion; I believe our adoption system is broken which only serves to encourage abortion. I've discussed abortion on this blog before, and I have discussed disabilities. I won't do it in depth again here. If anyone is really interested, search "abortion" and "disabilities" on this blog. Though I didn't agree with many of Marshall's issues positions before, I used to respect him as a smart man deserving of office. I no longer feel that way. I may add to this post later.
