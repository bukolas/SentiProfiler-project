The word that most of the people love the most and then get tired of it easily, 'forever'. Lovers existing in the poems still live with it, withstanding all the grimaces and graces. It exists in the politicians' vows, the mother's bonds, a friend's talks(how much ever fair weathered that friend is). It exists in the minds of the ladies who want their "perfect-est" guy. And according to a friend of mine, he says that all the female fraternity existing on the mother earth who believe in the fairy tales of the brave knight in shining armour or some macho hunk from the moon's chunk (reminds me of Goku from DBZ, don't know why) existing for them, should be given a whiff of reality. (I can hear: Take me down to the paradise city....where the grass is green and the men are hunky...oh won't you please take me hooouoome yeah yeh yeaaaaah....sigh. GnR. Sorry. A lapse of insanity. No meaning whatsoever). It exists in every relation's start and hides in a veil of decay after that, most of the times.


That word never does any justice to all, but seems to hide within it some strange magnet which every one craves for. All those promises, dreams. Like that song of oasis (song: little by little) says,


"dream our dreams alone with no resistance....

fading like the stars we wish to be."


Yes, forever fades away, too. And we see it. We live with that fact every day. Struggle to get a tiny part of that forever, to seek constancy in everything that we do. We don't like twists and changes thrown on our face every day of our life, we wish to do it at our pace. There are relations which you feel you always could keep them the same way, the way they are right now. Even after fights and disputes, we wish to seek the smiles on the same faces every single day of our life and without them, life goes a complete wreck. We seek "forever". But it's so futile, it's tragic. And sometimes, we fear the same tragic blow hitting us again and again in our life. But still, like a courageous (but scared within like crap) soldier, we march on towards the same old pits.
