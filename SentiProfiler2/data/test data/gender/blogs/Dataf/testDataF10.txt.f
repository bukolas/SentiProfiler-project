The other day a random thought crossed my mind while scanning through some photos of a friend…When was the last time i opened a album ? (i mean the paperback ones) God,it’s been so long ago..I can’t even remember now..Digital camera’s just spoilt us crazy..  I remember when we would just click pictures with our Minolta camera and wait desperately to receive the photos from the studio just to see how they turned out…That excitement is dead now..No curiosity ..nothing   Forget the inquisitiveness,that is an attribute long dead anyway…but the fact that you can sit on your favourite chair with a photo album and a cup of tea to remember the funny and happy times on a rainy evening..is just priceless…  I am not against digital camera’s…I love them! But the feeling when you can open  an album and reminisce is extraordinary…   Now for the smart ones out there..yeah yeah..just print the photo out…(i know that!) …but really how many of us do that? we just keep gaping at the photos on our laptops …!!!   I miss having pictures adorning my wall!  Pictures of you…and me
