My own personal is opinion is that the health care system is about how can make the most money. Health care, insurance, prescriptions, nursing homes are costing more and more every year and if you are lucky enough to have insurance the coverage is decreasing. What we need to do is start thinking about our citizens and not the bottom line. Many problems in this country stems from health care. We need to make insurance affordable for employers so they can make it affordable for their employees. One idea I like is being able to bank money that would initially go to insurance if you was to need it but if you don't use it would work like a savings account. There is alot of problems with health care and many other things in this country and hopefully the next person in charge of these problems will be able to conduct a plan that thinks about the middle class and the poor and not the rich lobbiest and drug companies.
