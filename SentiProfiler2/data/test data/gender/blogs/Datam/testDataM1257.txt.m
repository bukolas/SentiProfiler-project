Everything in marketing has changed. The way budgets are divided. The way strategies are constructed. The way we view our customer and their needs. And why is this? Social media. Yes ‘social media’, the term that is used the world over by overpaid boardroom bluffers, blagging their way through a maze of seeding, virals, apps and videos of monkeys skateboarding.

It’s instant; everyone in the room knows that this idea is the one. You don’t know whether to kiss or punch the unsuspecting genius, but you all know that’s what he is, a genius. I can only imagine that the following IKEA campaign was born of one of these moments.

Using a Facebook facility familiar to all of us, IKEA captured the attention of thousands of customers in launching their Malmo store. The following video case study shows the industry that, when it comes to social media, there is simply no substituting for that creative moment...
