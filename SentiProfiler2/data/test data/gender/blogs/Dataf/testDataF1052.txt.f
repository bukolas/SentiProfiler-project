I was planning on a Tibetan lesson last night, but when it got cancelled, I was left with “nothing” to do. “Nothing”, for me, apparently translates into:

Going for a run, getting rained on
Coming home, taking a shower
Emailing a bunch of people about upcoming shoots
Going to a cafe, eating a red velvet cupcake, and studying Tibetan for an hour or so
Walking home, stopping by the store on the way
Doing two blog posts about my yak leather bag(s) and an upcoming trip to Tibet
Receiving email back from people for the upcoming shoots–hurray, got the models I wanted!
Going to see my friend Will and his band Pure Ecstasy at a bar down the way, with camera in tow
Downloading shots, making selects, and exporting JPGs
Finally crashing into bed
And let’s note, that all took place between about 6pm and 1am. Solid evening! Here are a couple favorites from Pure Ecstasy at the Broadway Grill.
Stage lighting is so tricky. It looks awesome in person but is killer-hard to get right on camera. I think the trick is that you just have to completely GO WITH IT. So far as I know, there’s no good tool to “fight” it–and by that I mean normalize it somehow–other than going black and white. This is the kind of thing I can only seem to learn when I’m just messing around–like last night. By the way, I didn’t do any color correction on any of these photos–just tweaked the curves a little and added some noise reduction, along with a bunch of cropping.

Note also that I scared the crap out of the band when I snuck up behind them (whoops). Sometimes I think being a musician is a big advantage in shooting musicians–it does help me anticipate when things are going to happen–but then sometimes I think being a woman overshadows that completely.
