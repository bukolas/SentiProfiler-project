That was a very interesting and nice write-up. I could relate to most of the incidents/things mentioned but I have come to the conclusion " You cannot please everyone and you also dont have to please everyone". People will be there to advice,complain or comment whether you do things right or wrong....If someone very close to you offers advice/suggestion, it is worth pondering as they (this person ha ha)might see things differently....For the rest, just listen and move on!!
