Third-pharmaceutical companies in the US subsidize the lower cost of research drugs for the rest of the world-especially those countries with universal coverage. US pharmaceutical companies do all the R&D and FDA approval process-other countires are then allowed to buy from the pharmaceutical companies in bulk-increasing their residents savings. Allow pharmecutical companies a percentage cap of profit for US citizens say 10%-thus forcing them to reap their profits from the other countries around the world. Make other countries subsidize their share of the pharmecutical companies. Once they pay their fair share-they may not be so quick to tout the benefits of universal coverage.
