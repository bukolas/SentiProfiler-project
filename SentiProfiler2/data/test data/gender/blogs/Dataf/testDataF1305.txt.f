Some gorgeous flower pcs made by Rita Saardi as a premise of beautiful dancers wearing silk dresses for Peter Copping / Nina Ricci. I had blogged about Rita's beautiful work in a previous post here . This talented budding fashion designer (who is definitely going places) was recently invited by the house of Nina Ricci to collaborate with head designer Peter Copping for the Fall 2011 show. You can follow this exciting adventure with her on her blog here . You go girl! x Designed by Georg Bohle , this cool oak dining table neatly conceals an electric piano. Just lift up on the wooden tablet cut into one edge and you are ready to dazzle your dinner guests (via cribcandy ). I am so fantasizing about being living in a house like this. I love everything about it, everthing down to the pirate flag. (photography by Anitta Behrendt ) I simply love these dino wallpaper by Paperboy , the wallpaper specialists for boys. Would be lovely if they also had the decal versions of this of these dinosaurs! Available here ! I love these vintage lamps by Kathleen Hills. The vintage glass shades have been sourced by Kathleen and given a contemporary twist. I think thse beautiful hanging lights will add just the right touch of soft vintage style to any bedroom. I love the simple and modern look of these chairs by American designer Von Tundra . Built with domestic white oak, these chairs (named the prairie chair) are inspired by reductive modernism and the farmer-made furniture of the American Midwest. Designed by Elding Oscarson, the interior walls of this graphic design office in Stockholm are made up of literally thousands of magazines. I like how this original idea for a wallpaper reflects on the business of the graphic design company. Simple yet stunning! This grass green carpet is a perfect present for any football fan (young or old) and is designed by Karin Mannerst√•l. Karin is a multi-talented designer who is working with many different materials and media. She has, among other things, designed things for IKEA of Sweden. Available here
