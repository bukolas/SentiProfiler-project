I find that there are very few things in life that can't be remedied by dressing up as your favorite superhero. I have been thinking of getting a =W= tattoo as well. I need to represent the one consistency in my life. She is a proud, strong woman. I envy her, yet want to be her. Since I cannot become a Princess of Themyscira anytime soon, nor do I think that Diana is relinquishing her Lasso of Truth, so for now, I'll make pretend.

I need to get in on the next Comic Con that is around. I just can't wait to be living in the west, where it will be incredibly easy to attend nerdy events like this and hang out with people who get me.

I did try to play D&D in the mall. Hayden wouldn't let me. She ran away embarrassed.

You know what? Boys who play D&D are cute. I stand strongly by that statement.

I've got to download WoW for my Mac now that I have a nice enough OS to be running it. Then I need to transfer chellechanel on over to a new server so I can start taking people down with Titan's Grip. That's my shit.
