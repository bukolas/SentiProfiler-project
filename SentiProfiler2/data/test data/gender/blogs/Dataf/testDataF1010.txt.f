Missionary Man
Bradford got his mission call. He'll be serving in the Ghana Accra Mission. He reports to the MTC there on Oct. 23rd. We have a lot of shots and passport getting to do before that.



Yea, Bradford. We are excited for you and very proud that you are worthy and willing to serve in this fashion. We love you.

Ok. It's not happening.
Ok. I guess that project 365 is over for this time around. Kind of sad but facing reality.


Here's a couple of pictures of Lillian in a dress I made. I took a class at a little shop. The dress has a bubble skirt and elastic thread smocking.

Project 365 update
I am sorry for the missed weeks. Once I got behind it was too much to post that many old weeks at a time and then I stopped taking the pictures. I still like the idea of the project so I'm going to start over. Here are some of the photos that never got posted.
