Failed Communities, Failed Schools.                                                                                        I suppose we should be pleased that Pres. Obama found some sort of mojo somewhere (maybe Hillary told him where to look). Of course, as we might have expected from him and his ofay administration, he selected one of the weakest groups to target—teachers and schools. I’d really love to hear him threaten Congress and their handmaiden lobbyists with such gusto.

He got all pumped for his appearance at the US Chamber of Commerce, a group that thrives on bluster. He cited the wisdom of the Central Falls Board of Education (RI) for their firing of the entire high school faculty and staff. He framed his praise thus: “Our kids get only one chance at an education, and we need to get it right.” I guess the assumption is that everyone knows what “right” is. He had Colin “You break it, you own it” Powell by his side. And then there was Obama’s more characteristic mealy-mouthed assertion, “If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn’t show some signs of improvement, then there’s got to be a sense of accountability.” Well, yes, I’d say firing a whole faculty shows a sense, but not of accountability. No, the sense of accountability goes way beyond the faculty and even beyond the administration.
