Monetary values change as consciousness changes. Prosperity Consciousness is Higher Consciousness because it is an expansion of the projection of the individual mind unto infinity and that is the reason why Yogi Bhajan taught us for the first ten years about meditation and yoga to help us heal ourselves, physically and mentally and then he started teaching us prosperity consciousness because it becomes more obviously important for one to become prosperous materially as one progresses spiritually. Yogi Bhajan was such a master that he was able to teach us the importance of this. If you look at any other spiritual discipline, you may or may not find this. As spritually aware people who are also conscious of our physical health we must balance all aspects of life. that is what yoga means to find the balance in all things.
