GOD should have been an Engineer!! -   The World and The Software Developmnet Life Cycle!!

God made this world in 5 days.... Ever wondered how??


If God was able to make us and everything else in 5 days, why do software engineers have to devote so much time in developing a simple system which is infinitesimally small compared to this planet?

"GOD , for one , did not have any installed base to worry about upward integration and compatibility . No platform dependency.....

and I'm guessing he skipped most part of documentation also....."

No wonder He ended up with such a mess.

Maybe if GOD had followed SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), maybe the earth woul have been a better place to live in.

P.S : I'm also sure that GOD used some Open Source Technology under the EULA Liscencing and the copyleft standards which explains so many versions of the same species all around us!! ;-)

Well, GOD should have taken Computer Science Engineering. And if he did take it... he should have paid attention in class.

So.... Now gotta get back to work... have to complete the documentation for my project... bye!!!
