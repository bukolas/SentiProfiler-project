One of the more unconscionable things Mr. Stupak is doing is lying about the current (bad) legislation. He’s telling his colleagues that women using their own money in the exchanges will be able to buy insurance coverage that pays for abortion. There is no abortion funding in the current bad bill. What Mr. Stupak wants to do is move one step forward to outlawing abortion through health care legislation, one step at a time.

As an aside, Rep. Stupak’s scheduled 11 a.m. press conference was postponed due to what’s being called “a scheduling conflict.” You decipher it. Congress members, we’re finding out through the health care debate, aren’t very bright and since this legislation is complex, with the exchanges making things worse, all sorts of things can be said to frighten the ignorant.

It’s unconscionable that men who call themselves “liberal” are saying women should suck Stupak language up in the name of a bad health care bill that is much less than Democrats should accept. But that’s what we’re hearing from “progressive” men.

Michael Moore is one of the only powerfully visible males to decide Bart Stupak had gone too far, writing today a wonderful essay on the idiocy of Mr. Stupak’s position. Enter John Dingell, a powerful, longtime force in the House, who is getting the message from women that we understand compromise, because we’re asked to do it all the time, but Bart Stupak’s language and his insistence that he’s more important than the majority who support women’s self-determination is one step way too far.  Things remain fluid, with there still a strong probability that the Democrats will still pull this off. However, they need to do it without caving to Bart Stupak.
