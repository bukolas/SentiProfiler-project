This morning, I had two interesting thoughts. The first pertains to a remark I heard by a coworker 13 years ago. “If heaven is real,” she said, “I don’t want to go there. It would be boring.” This morning, I had a thought that, given that God is omnipotent, the possibilities for heaven are limitless. Specifically, one could conceive that each room in the kingdom of heaven might be its own universe , with its own space, its own galaxies, its own planets, its own flora and fauna. Maybe not exactly like that, but that’s one possibility that shows what an amazing and interesting place it will be. No, Sarah, heaven will not be boring. The second thought was about the idea of multiple universes that is currently fashionable. If there are other universes, can one universe visit the inhabitants of another universe? Probably not, which is sad. But , perhaps we will see each other in the kingdom of heaven? That is another reason why heaven will not be boring. Today I take up as my life's mission the following phrase from The Imitation of Christ, Book II, Chapter 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare a worthy dwelling for Christ in my heart. This philosophy is applicable to any state in life. We take whatever comes our way, and use it to prepare our hearts as a dwelling for Christ. If there is trouble in the family, or at work, or in friendship, we treat it as a sharing in the suffering of Christ. When we see others better off than us, we do not envy them, having forsaken the riches of the world, to prepare our hearts for Christ. If we are ill and confined to a bed for the remainder of our years, we use the time profitably in prayer, to prepare our hearts to receive Christ. In this way we attain peace in times of prosperity and in times of affliction. Pope Benedict XVI: "Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to find in this Lenten Season prolonged moments of silence, possibly in retreat, in order to review your own lives in the light of the loving plan of the heavenly Father." Angelus: Second Sunday of Lent, 8 March (1st Sunday of Lent, St. Andrew's Cathedral, Victoria BC) Rainbow as announcement of God's mercy: Even if man falls into sin, God will not destroy the earth. Christ fulfills this covenant. Harrowing of Hell: purgatory. Another sign of mercy. Baptism more than ritual: a sacrament of mercy, through which we are saved. Also a gift of holiness, as it unites us to God. Also, a task to live in a way befitting this gift. Temptation is especially strong in times of holiness, such as the Lenten season. We must persevere. Realize the love and forgiveness of Christ. Spread the joy of Christ. Went to Confession today, and Father Benoit ended with, &quot;God bless you, and be happy.&quot; Will do!

Or what makes a day well lived? Is it to eat well, drink well, and be glad? To pray in a silent room? To build sandcastles beneath blue skies? To create? How does one live well if one were shut up in a cell with no food? No materials, no books, no light Just hunger, and thoughts, and pain, philosophy, religion, contemplation, emotion, meditation, and confusion? What makes a day well lived? Or is it better to consider a week? Or a month, or a year, or a lifetime? Is it better not to consider it at all, but to live haphazardly, from one inclination to the next, going by feel, gut, recollection, remonstrance, rebuke, appetite? On what can we ground our living? On what motto, creed, or ideal? Shall poetry lead us, or some ancient script, a philosopher from Greece or Rome, a symphony, a painting, an epitaph? Shall we lose ourselves in language or in study, in literature, physics, studying the cosmos? Will we find our salvation in the order and reason of mathematics? How does one live well? Or what makes a day well lived? Is it to eat well, drink well, and be glad? To pray in a silent room? To build sandcastles beneath blue skies? To create?
