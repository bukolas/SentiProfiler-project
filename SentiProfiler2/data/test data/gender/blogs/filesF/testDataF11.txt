The past months have been bitter sweet...I love my baby boy/girl. But some things are just stress in me so much to the point where I can’t take it no more. I can’t wait till my baby is here and camdon starts his new job soon. So many things are changing. But it’s for the better. I’ve been so stressed and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to handle it. And all this stress has nothing to do with the baby. I feel like I can’t do anything without someone saying something back to make me feel stupid. It’s to the point where I wanna leave and never come back. I’m sick of been made fun of and I’m sick of getting talked down to like I’m some kind of dog. Things need to change but i know they won’t. I guess I gotta suck it up and deal with it. I shouldn’t have to...
I just finished, well, started and finished, the Twilight series over the weekend. I've been sick, so I've had some extra time on my hands.

As a literature minor, I'd been curious about the books I'd heard were "well written." I wanted to read them to see what the big deal was.

Starting the books, I was initially annoyed. The melodramatic character of Bella Swan is a whiny (irritatingly so), obsessive, dark, misunderstood misfit, or so she feels. But, as I continued the first book, I got attached to its brilliance. Stephanie Meyer captures the emotions, passion, fear and romance for her primary audience of romantically inexperienced preteen and teenage girls. She creates an overwhelming dichotomy of passionate love and perfect friendship with the characters of Edward Cullen and Jacob Black.

In the end, I would never call the series a literary masterpiece. However, its brilliance to entrap the hearts of girls everywhere is undeniable. Even as I was reading it, I felt myself believing in what Edward and Bella have, despite knowing how unrealistic their relationship is, outside of the whole vampire thing.

Deep down, every girl wants an "Edward"--a man who is incredibly passionate, who believes and shares with her that he would die without her. She wants a love relationship where the spark never dies, where every kiss is more intense than the last and where the chemistry tears through her insides. And, she wants a man who longs for her to be with him at all times, who misses her intensely when they are apart, who protects her in every situation and who knows without a doubt that she is his soulmate.
So to start this off, it was just a normal day. I hung with my friends all day, and had a blast. Well, we all decided to drink that night. So I got some alcohol, and invited some people over to have a little get-together. Bad idea. It was about 1am, and the cops got called for a noise disturbance. Obviously, we were being loud but, personally, I didn't feel we were. Well as you all know, when a minor is intoxicated, they automatically get an MIP. Well, everyone in my room got one. Which I find completely unfair considering the fact that everyone in the house, except my Grandmother, was drinking. Well, once everyone went home, I was laying there thinking. Thinking if this is truly how I want my life to be. If I wanted to grow up with a criminal record. If I wanted to grow up an alcoholic. If I wanted to grow up not knowing if my life could be any better then what it is.
So many things are changing, yet everything is the same. I have not worked much since 2009. Soon all the things I have routinely done at home will come to a halt: baking, gardening, & park day. I will instead spend the weekends working shows in Virginia and Maryland visiting with friends, sleeping in different beds and driving rental vans. I will not be able to lean on Paul to back me up. 

For many months I had the regularity of meditation and exercise keeping me on track, I was feeling good about going into the new working year, but for the past 2 months I have had a swollen knee due to a torn meniscus, which has put a halt to the intense work out I was enjoying. I'm not sure why I lost the Breathe.

I don't hold onto familiarity and I am not dependent on regularity. I have never really felt settled anywhere. Many, many years ago I was working on the Celestine Prophecy workbook and one of the tasks was to connect the dots that lead to where you are now. In other words what events brought me here, right now. The goal was to understand that there are always many choices we can make, and the one we do make is significant to where we go: It is what we do in the moment that leads to the next moment. I believe I understand with such clarity why I chose to live on St. Thomas because it had everything I "thought I wanted" and everything I really did want.

I often wonder why I moved to Las Vegas. What is the lesson? What was the need?

I believe I moved to Las Vegas, to learn how to be a better parent. I moved here to meet more people who reassure me that by listening to my gut, connecting with my child, and considering his father, I will make the best choices to leave upon my son.

After only a month of moving into our home, I contacted a homeschooling group, who's description appealed to me. "We hope to support and inspire each other on our journeys of living and learning. Because respect for the child is at the core of unschooling, we expect our members to act accordingly on the list and in real life gatherings. We embrace diversity and hope that all who join our group will respect each others' differences and remain open to learning from each other." This group's members have changed since I first joined. There are only 3 families from our original beginnings that are still regulars in the group. Las Vegas, like St. Thomas is filled with transients. 

One of the Four Noble Truths: The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. When I meet a friend I know they are not permanent, that my happiness does not rely on their being, but I know that just by calling them friend they have given me a little more understanding of my true self. They have left a lasting impression.

Another transient (though born here is leaving for life on the road) and one I call friend is leaving the LifeLearners, she is moving on, following her heart, facing her fears and becoming her true self. And again I realize that things will change. Our ego wants us to believe these changes are dramatic, but in reality they are subtle.

My ego misses my friend tonight. My ego sheds tears for the absent Wednesday chair.

I am feeling shaken and stirred. It's time to remember to how to breathe.
I picked her up on Saturday, after a night of lots of partying and little sleeping. Yes, I'm gangster. We didn't get home until 5 in th morning on Sunday. We had lots of fun. We kayaked, shopped, tried on tons of clothes in a co-ed dressing room (I got caught by a male worker in my bra, then later, dancing retardedly - sweet! as in, embarrassing), went on rescue missions with the boys (rescued a boat load of unshaven, smelly, barefoot.. hippies! The stinkiest rescue mission of all time, thanks Bob!), got pedicures, paddled at midnight to see phosphorescence, oogled hot guys, barbecued at Jays, crashed a dinner party at Tugboat Annies...  and I even got away with some stuff that I'd never have gotten away with if Joshlynn wasn't there. Like taking pictures of ourselves in the round mirror in the middle of the marina store.
This is a normal sight at our house. My husband, at work. He's definitely not one to leave it at the office. Relaxing just isn't in his blood. He cannot do something halfway, and doesn't understand how anyone else can, either. When he doesn't have anything to do, he goes and learns something. Like one of 5 programming languages he taught himself in the 90's. How to repair his own bike. How to build a computer. How to speak French. Extensive reading on Buddhist philosophy. Sailing in the 1800's. Sci Fi. Or changing his career path entirely, from Art (Yes, Art!!!) to Geology and Mineralogy to Geomicrobiology to Environmental Chemistry and Technology to Nanotechnology to Thinfilms to Solar Technology to Materials Science to Architecture and Sustainability to who knows what.

And he doesn't stop there. He not only learned French, he worked to get us a position there so I would be able to realize my dream of living in France one day. And now, he wants to find a way to go back.

A vacation for him is not laying on a beach with a beer. (Though he'd happily walk through a museum with a beer.) On our honeymoon in New Orleans, he went to every museum there was. Thankfully, we're well matched. I love that, too.

He's kind of maxed out on the academics--though I guess he could get a second PhD (don't tell him, please!) As a professor, he's constantly busy teaching, recruiting, researching, mentoring, leading a solar decathlon team, and now heading up an entirely new degree program. He's not tenure-track, but even if he was and got it, he said he wouldn't change a thing. It's who he is. The idea of taking it easy just isn't a part of his DNA. He can't not do his best. I love that about him. I love how hard he works, both for his calling's sake and for his family's sake. I love that when he believes in something, it is with every fiber of his being. I love his devotion.

This week, he figured something out. For the first time in 36+ years, he's bored.

Heaven help us.
Introducing… Cole Isaac Gilbert



The baby is here!  Thanks to everyone who has helped out in the past few weeks, especially those guest posters.  I’ll continue to be on semi-maternity leave over the next few weeks, but I wanted to share the good news and my birth story (for those interested).  Cheers!  Christine

Cole Isaac Gilbert

Born: 3/5/10 9:50 PM

21 inches long

“The Cure”

I had breezed past my due date and by Friday my midwife wanted me to get an ultrasound to make sure the baby was still thriving in his post-40-week world.  We were planning a homebirth, a carefully weighed decision based in part on the nearly perfect health I had been experiencing throughout the pregnancy and my strong desire to avoid a c-section, especially since we would be birthing in the US, where c-section rates top 30%. It’s not a choice for everyone, but we were well-educated about the options and it felt right.

That afternoon, I ate lunch and headed over to the ultrasound appointment.  Drew and I sat in  silence as the tech tried to jiggle our baby into movement.  The bio physical scan scored the baby based on 4 types of movement, from rolling over to “practice breathing”.  Our score?  Zero.  I drank some juice.  I poked the baby and wiggled my abs.  After 30 minutes, our midwife transferred us to the hospital for more tests.  The baby wasn’t moving.

Remember that perfectly healthy pregnancy I talked about?  Well apparently on Week 40, Day 4 I developed pregnancy induced hypertension.  Normally you’d see this after the six month point, when the women’s blood pressure starts to creep up and her kidneys begin dropping protein into the urine and her feet and hands might get really swollen.  According to the blood work, I had moved past that first stage of just hypertension, beyond mild pre-eclampsia and was now looking at some of the scarier effects like my kidneys not working correctly, blood clotting issues and potential seizures (when blood pressure in a pregnant women gets too high they don’t stroke out, they have a seizure… fun fact).

The cure?  The doctor sat down and tried to couch it as nicely as possible.  “The only cure is to have this baby.”

We didn’t freak out, in fact we were very calm about the matter.  We spent about 30 minutes quizzing the doctor on the relative merits of induction verses cesarean, the likelihood of success based on cervical favorably, bishop score and methods used, and ultimately what did he think was the safest for everyone involved?  “If it was my wife or daughter? A c-section”.

I think everyone (the doctor, nurses and midwife included) were a bit surprised when we said, “Okay.”  Maybe they expected us to  fight it, to try to come up with some way to birth at home or to take the insane risk of disregarding the medical advice we had been given.   But to us, a home birth was about safety, not about some ego-driven one upmanship over our child-bearing peers.  A low risk, healthy birth is safest when left alone… but all of that goes out of the window once there is complications.  If you are sick, if your baby is at risk, you want a doctor there.  That’s why we did the tests and ultrasounds… to rule out anything that would cause us problems down the road.  Well, it worked.  I signed the paperwork and they prepped me for surgery.

I won’t go into too much detail about the actual surgery, as it’s not pleasant.  You wouldn’t expect it to be, I’m sure, but I might have of had a slightly harder time than other women as the spinal made me extremely sick.  There is one moment I’ll always remember though, and it’s the single bright spot in the experience.  I was gasping for breath from beneath the sickly plasticy smelling oxygen mask, with my own vomit drying on my face and in my hair, trying to not succumb again and I heard my baby’s first cry.  I couldn’t have been further from the moment, forgetting completely why I was subjecting myself to this and his piercing scream pulled me right back.  I burst into tears and felt this clear, indescribable  joy.

Afterward, I got everything I wanted.  Cole was alert and latched an hour after surgery (when they stabilized me enough to permit breastfeeding).  I stayed up with him most of the night, marveling his perfect little features, the way he pouted (my husband says he gets this from me) and the way his breathing gets excited as he gets close to me.  I had spent all this time planning the perfect birth, and I got almost none of my wishes, except one.  A healthy baby.  Later I would tell Drew that the disappointment, the anger, the sadness of having our plans dashed would take time to heal.  Really though, it  hasn’t been time.. the cure has been Cole.  Being with him has been so opposite, so perfectly wonderful, it’s redemptive.  I feel like I won the baby lottery.
Today’s guest post is from Alison at http://cheeseweb.eu, a very cool expat blogger.  I especially liked this post for the insight into expat life, but also a new twist on the “Why Blog?” debate.  Once you’re done reading this be sure to check out her excellent photography here.



When I started blogging, I wasn’t trying to make money on-line or become famous. In fact, I never expected anyone other than my friends and family would read it. But now, I’m pretty sure that blogging saved my expat life.

I moved to Belgium five years ago as a trailing spouse. My husband and I decided together that we wanted to try living in Europe. The opportunity came up sooner than we expected, when his company offered to move us to Brussels. Legalities being what they are in Belgium, I was unable to get a work-permit as the trailing spouse, so my days were filled with getting our new life settled.

Back then, blogging wasn’t as ubiquitous as it is now, and I didn’t know much about it, but I got tired of writing the same things and answering the same questions in a dozen e-mails. I had learned basic web design and HTML in school so I decided to start a website to share stories and photos with my friends and family back home.

My blog posts were basically extended letters. I didn’t think much about grammar or structure. My posts didn’t have a topic other than what I had been up to since the last time I wrote. I never expected anyone that didn’t know me would bother much with my blog.

In those first few months, I wrote only about happy things – new places we travelled to, new discoveries we made, etc.

The shiny newness of expat life wore off pretty quickly though. The reality was I was mired in mountains of Belgian bureaucracy and red-tape. We had no support from my husband’s company; we didn’t speak the language; we knew no one and we lived in a small community with limited public transportation. I spent most of my days feeling isolated and depressed and wondering what the hell I had done.

I didn’t want to burden my family and friends with my woes. Honestly, I felt like a failure for being depressed in the first place. I mean, I was living in Europe after all. Something that is a dream for most people was my reality. Except most days it felt more like a nightmare.

I turned to the blogosphere for help. Although there weren’t many expat blogs based in Belgium at that time, I found some blogs written by expat women in other countries who were writing about the exact feelings I was having. Suddenly I didn’t feel so alone and it gave me the courage to write about what I was really experiencing.

It was scary to put my stress, struggles and depression out there, but instead of scorn for my whining, I started to get email and comments from other women in my situation. Some were already in Belgium, some were planning an expat move and all of them had similar fears and worries as me.

I was contacted by an expat news website in Belgium and asked to do a weekly column about my experiences in Belgium. Through that column, even more trailing spouses contacted me and encouraged me to keep writing and sharing.

It didn’t happen overnight, but gradually things got better. Because of my blog, I met people, I had an outlet for my stress and worry and I had a sense of purpose. Blogging and the support of my readers gave me the courage to pursue my career as a photographer.

Five years later, my blog and my life have changed dramatically. First of all, we have both moved out of isolation – me to the centre of Brussels and my blog to its own domain.

CheeseWeb is now much less focused on my day to day life and more on expat life in general. It covers a range of topics about life and travel in Belgium. I have guest posters on different topics from art to technology and I write about many different travel destinations around Europe.

Blogging opened so many doors for me in the early months of my expat life and continues to today. I honestly believe that blogging saved my expat life.
commercialized us!!!! How many of us in today's world have time to think just for a second how commercialized the world has become or rather we have become? Are v now what we really wanted to be? Are we synchronized with what we have studied and what we are doing?Let me place myself as an example. I have studied electronics and instrumentation but i am sitting for placements for a software company. Ok lets say thats what life is. But when we know thats what life is then why do we have many other options other than comp.science and the IT??? If what everybody wants is money then yes software is the right field but 10 years from now where would u get ur computers if u r programming down der? Who would teach ur children if ur friends are along with u?? Everybody wants the IITs and IIMs but how many of them work for INDIA?? Friends just sit back and think where did your journey start what was YOUR goal are u reaching for the one u started ur journey?? Many of us think our aim is to earn and keep the family happy. But how many of us are happy in the process. A family always supports what you do if it is right. A happy mind is necessary to keep the family happy right? Job satisfaction is most important i feel rather than money. But very few would agree with me because the world is like that. Comp.science students no hard feelings. This blog is dedicated to all the hardware STUDENTS. I would say ENGINEERS coz i dont know how many of us will really work as hardware engineers.
I realized that the best time to start potty training is when the kid is around 5 months old. When the head doesn't need support and the neck is firm. At that age, they don't run around and it is easier to put them on the potty. You will be able to identify when they want to "go" so you start putting them on the small potty. For my son that's what my mom did - that habit continued and he kind of started knowing that "If I am put on the potty I must sort-of push ". Now my son is a year old and quite recently I started the habit of taking him to the bathroom and putting him on the regular potty. So now he knows to say "baa" (bathroom) when we wants to "go".
I see that some parents (new of course!) are finding it difficult to potty train kids after they reach the walking age. Kids just get used to the diaper and refuse to sit in one place. Of course, this doesn't come with the side effects of other "settais" (I think vaguley translates to naughty behavior) -These days he loves to go to the bathroom and play with the water. So he will make that "I have to go" face . I tried putting him on the smaller potty - he sat there for 2 seconds and started pointing to the door and he says "baa". I took him to the bathroom and he immediately ran to the bucket to play with the water! So I am as usual running behind him!
Missionary Man
Bradford got his mission call. He'll be serving in the Ghana Accra Mission. He reports to the MTC there on Oct. 23rd. We have a lot of shots and passport getting to do before that.



Yea, Bradford. We are excited for you and very proud that you are worthy and willing to serve in this fashion. We love you.

Ok. It's not happening.
Ok. I guess that project 365 is over for this time around. Kind of sad but facing reality.


Here's a couple of pictures of Lillian in a dress I made. I took a class at a little shop. The dress has a bubble skirt and elastic thread smocking.

Connor finished his Track season.
My dad works on submarines, so I’ve been around them here and there (and certainly heard about them) since I was a little kid. I vaguely remember going on a tour of one when I was probably about 9 or 10. Last Christmas my dad took me & Gabe on a tour of a sub in Virginia, and let me tell you, they seem a LOT smaller inside when you’re a grownup.

But I digress. At some point I was talking with my dad about an analytics problem I was working on, and describing the process I was using to try to figure something out. He told me the tale of the USS Scorpion, a sub that went down somewhere in the Pacific, and the process the Navy used to locate the sub. I was transfixed as he told me about John Craven, the mastermind behind the search effort, and his use of an old mathematical theory that quantifies the value of hunches. They used it to successfully locate the sub. (More about that soon.)

Anyway, that was enough of a motivation to get me to read this book, and now I AM OBSESSED WITH SUBMARINES. Seriously. It’s out of control. But they’re fascinating! The book is full of all true stories of submarines from WWII through the Cold War, and it was the first time that a lot of these stories were made public. I can’t recommend it enough.
That's Not My Name and That's OK
I used to think walking was merely a way to get from point A to point B or to exercise. Sometimes both. When I’m alone, I’m plugged into my iPod. When I’m with a friend, we talk. A walk is a walk is a walk…until I walked with Claire. 

The girl doesn’t know it, but she always knows exactly what to do and say to put things in perspective. 

This morning we decided to walk uptown to the post office and library. She put on her Dora sneakers and tan jacket, and I surprised her with new purple mittens with hearts and rainbows I bought her on winter clearance. This made her very happy. 

I put on my pink backpack loaded with the envelopes that needed to be mailed, my phone and some money since I was pretty sure I had library fines to reconcile. Claire put on her Dora backpack. 

The weather was lovely – sunny and about 40 degrees when we started walking. Sidewalks are inconsistent for the first few blocks, so we cut down an alley to avoid street traffic. As we passed a garage, Claire asked, “Where’d my shadow go?” 

“What, honey?” I asked. 

She stopped. “My shadow, Grammy.” 

Shadow? But of course! I haven’t thought about my shadow since I was a kid, except to maybe avoid looking at it when I was obese. 

“It’s hidden by the garage,” I told her. “Let’s move back into the sunshine.” 

“There it is! It’s big!” she said. “You have a big shadow, too, Grammy!” and she waved. “See my hand?”

I waved back with both hands. She giggled.

“I see your fingers in the shadow,” she said. 

When we turned the corner we were back on a sidewalk and our shadows were in front of us. Claire hopped over each crack for the rest of the block, thrilled that her shadow kept up with her. 

We got to a corner at which we had to cross a street. I was holding her hand and was just going to walk her across when it dawned on me that I could teach her how to properly cross a street. 

“Always stop before walking out on to the street,” I said. “Look to your left. Do you see a car coming?”

Looking very concentrated, she peered down the street. “No,” she said seriously.

“Now look to your right. Any cars?”

“Nope.” 

“OK, that means we can cross safely.” 

We walked down a street I’ve walked for years, but I’d never really noticed that the Purinton’s house was blue or the rental next door had green trim until Claire pointed it out. Then she spied tiny purple flowers in the next yard. 

“Oooo! Those are crocuses,” I told her. 

“Crocheches,” she repeated. Close enough. 

I wouldn’t have noticed them on an ordinary walk. I notice them in my own yard because I’m looking for them, but crocuses are even better when you’re not seeking them out and spectacular when you unexpectedly get to introduce them to a 2-year-old who loves the colors purple and green. 

“I run real fast, Grammy!” and she took off. I kept up by walking more briskly, but it was fun to let her get to the next house a little before I did. 

We were getting close to another corner and she took my hand. We stopped, she looked both ways, and we walked safely across. 

We went to the post office first, which is next door to the library. I handed the envelopes to the mail clerk. Claire said, “I want to see,” so I lifted her up to sit on the counter. 

“I like your mittens,” said the clerk. Claire’s shy and so she just smiled and looked down at the hearts and rainbows. 

“Can she have a lollipop?” he whispered to me. I nodded. 

“Would you like a lollipop?” he asked Claire.

“Yes,” she said rather boldly, and I thought, Yeah, I’ve always preferred candy over compliments, too. 

She reached in the bag and pulled out a small chocolate flavored Tootsie-Pop. She’s definitely my granddaughter. 

“What do you say?” I asked her. 

“Thank you,” she said staring at her mittens again, but he heard her. 

“You’re welcome,” he said. 

She insisted I open the wrapper before we left the post office and I didn’t want her to bring it into the library, so we sat on a bench out front and she ate her lollipop. 

“A black truck,” she pointed to the street. “That’s Papa’s truck.” Her dad’s dad is Papa and drives a pickup. 

“No, that’s not Papa’s truck, but it looks like it,” I said.

“That’s a red car,” she continued and crunched her lollipop. 

“Hear that?” she asked.

“That’s a blue jay,” I said. 

“Blue jay,” she repeated and took another bite of her lollipop.

Watching Claire observe the world around her – the world I’ve very much taken for granted – this Ting-Tings song came into my head: 

They call me girl
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane


That’s not my name
That’s not my name
That’s not my name
That’s not my name

They can call me Emily. They can call me Shawna. But that’s not my name. I’m Grammy. I’m Mom. I’m Lynn. I know who I am. I know how I lost weight. I could spend all kinds of money fighting these bogus websites illegally using my images only to find other sites doing the same thing. Or I can let it go and live in the world around me. My real world. 

I have a shadow. The crocuses are blooming. I’m teaching Claire how to cross the street and what a blue jay sounds like. People can believe what they want about my images. I know what’s true. Nothing else matters.
Time has been judgemental ..eversince its existence is known ;)  Do not you feel so?.......TIME just the word seems so common even in the illiterates...why?
I think it is because it affects and judges us all. Its impact is wide enough to neglect its name "TIME".

The galaxies, the stars, the Universe.....as a whole has been judged by time. Their states depict the impact and the judgment of time on them. Beautiful and ruthless TIME can be at times :)

As they say about the mutual existence of things good vs evil, love vs hate....I was wondering who can oppose the merciless judgments of time?????.........there is something :) that can ditch time and we all can escape from the judgments of time........The Black holes

Wish we had something to switch between both of them......so that we can give a nice TIME to TIME looking for us......you got me right "The time machine"
I woke up today and got on with my morning rituals – checked my Gmail, Facebook, and listened to some feel-good songs on Youtube. Then I logged on to Google Talk after quite a few weeks to update myself on my friends’ statuses, their profile pictures, etc. It gave me a fair clue of how they were doing. I came to Facebook again. But this time around, I found too much information about the same people – what they like, which groups and activities they are a part of, which games they play, where they have been traveling, whom they have been hanging out with, bla bla – and all this confused me. Trust me, a year back, I kinda used to dislike Google chatting, since it prevented me from thinking about what I was saying. I preferred snail emailing to chatting as it was more static and easier to handle. And today, I find myself preferring Gtalk to Facebook. Why? Simply because Gtalk is not a social networking site where I have to keep projecting an image of my Self. Gtalk is a directed, simple two-dimensional medium wherein I can have a one-on-one conversation with a person I am actually interested to talk to and know about. Wow! Now all of a sudden this has become a privilege, thanks to Facebook and twitter. Suddenly, I feel relieved that I have some real people who are not too addicted to Facebook, and who are not looking at my “information” to know me, but are going beyond it to spend real time with me outside these news updates. And hey, I honestly feel this change happened in just the past one year, when all of us got overly addicted to Facebook. Social Networking with people who live in the same city and area as you – Quite a bad idea. I am very much for picking up my landline,calling up my friend and catching up especially when I live in the same country as him/her, and where local rates are the same as internet costs. I want something real dude – like a human voice maybe? And not a profile picture to connect to a person. Eeks. Creeps me out.  I think its high time someone started a Facebook Regulatory Board – on what can be done and what can’t be done on Facebook. It is such a mess otherwise. And NO. Privacy settings hardly matter and hardly help. Well yes, I do hear some of your counter arguments btw – That Facebook helps me market my events, it helps me connect to older school buddies, it obliviates hierarchies and protocols between people. Hmm…. Alright..  I can accept that to an extent. But whatever happened to respecting privacy? And its not even about others’ privacy here. Respecting your own privacy – what happened to that? Its lost. Gone. I find a lot of people not caring or thinking about what they put up on Facebook, I find myself in that situation too, mainly because Facebook started as a Fun, light-hearted means to pass time. Suddenly you wake up to the fact that its a lot more of a serious affair. Highly unsettling. Anyway.. Being the optimist that I am and desperate to conclude things on a good note like Bollywood movies, I do accept that dear old facebook can be positive at times, which is why I have still not terminated my account there. For instance, there was almost a virtual, spontaneous school reunion –  thanks to an old class photo which someone posted (it happened a few days back and delighted me  ). Everyone started commenting, feeling nostalgic about old teachers and old life, thanks to this photo - as high as 120 comments in a day!! Or a friend who was able to get in touch with me when she really needed my help, but was in some remote part of the world and had lost my mail. Now that – is truly awesome!
Culling
In the winter, I find myself in a state of retreat, like a tree, in an inert state of waiting. Watching. The sun ekes through the windows at the most pitiful angle. I push my writing desk right up against the window to try and absorb whatever light is going to be doled out. Inspiration trickles in droplets one by one. Inertia wanes. Daily business unfurls at its slow French city pace across my square. It is tempting to passively watch. In past years, I have always done what it takes to shake things up, to keep things from freezing over, but it's true. Winter has always been hard for me.

This is my first winter with the baby. While I still won't say everything changed, something very big has shifted. A lot of time goes into animating, teaching, comforting and reassuring my little boy. I am blowing on coals. New coals. Hot coals. I am constantly moving to stay one step ahead. I must explain to him what we plan to do. The spontaneity that I used to rely on to shake things up during the winter has been transformed into my breath on these hot coals.

This week in the kitchen cure, I am thinking about optimization, which translates to freedom. I'll take it wherever I can get it. I am culling equipment from the kitchen, and most of all, moving things around. I have a couple of shelves full of things I rarely use, so I am moving these things out and creating new space for the things I should have close by.

Do you have any equipment on your counter that just takes up real estate? I have very little counter space. In fact, when you count that which is taken up by the grinder, the mixer, and the kettle, I don't have any at all. I have become adept at using cork mats as anchors for cutting boards along the edge of things. When I am cooking things that involve more mise en place than simple slicing and chopping on little boards along the way, my kitchen moves out to one of the two work tables outside the kitchen.

Now that the sun is finally beginning to fill the house again, It's time to put the pastry table back by the window, and move my writing desk to a quiet place in the house. This is a very good time for my kitchen cure. I need to optimize my kitchen, to do away with unnecessary steps. Time is more precious now than ever.

Foraging: Thoughts on a Monday
This talk about the people on the market who sell their foraged wild herbs got me thinking this weekend. It was cold up there and the ground is still frozen solid. I spent some cozy time indoors with a piece of tracing paper over a map of the land, dreaming about what we might try to accomplish this year in the garden. Last year we simply cleared the field by hand and spread mixed wild flower seed, and it was very nice. We also randomly planted some vegetables around here and there, and we were rewarded with some very nice zucchini, potatoes and beans. 

While I am thinking about dried herbs and seeds and the ones I loved the most as I replenish my spice drawer, I realize that it's the wild ones that get me so excited at the market here in the city. One very useful task this summer will be to learn to see more wild herbs and edible plants all around us on country walks and out in the field outside the kitchen door. I often catch sight of old women out on steady and slow early morning walks in the hills when it is warm out, carrying small baskets. This I suppose is the bucolic image that causes the tourists to come and clear everything from sides of the well worn hiking trails. But in the little homey places away from the stations, the farmland and grazing paths, where we can walk all day barely seeing anybody, it can't hurt to cut a sprig here or there. 

Foraging anything takes a bit of method in thoughtfulness. For example, when out picking herbs, have the sense enough to use a field knife and cut them, leaving the base in tact. Leave the roots, and cut only what you need. There's no need to rip any plant whole from the ground, effectively exterminating it. Give it a chance to grow back. Last year I did transplant some wild strawberries that spread and grew from their little sheltered spot under the cherry tree. But I was careful about it, and did it with respect for the path I was walking on. Mindful of my intention to nurture this plant as a special project, I took the whole plant from a place where thousands more were growing.
Get wat u want :) - After a long time, i m bloggin n i wanted to talk on sumthin substantial n sumthin every1 ll relate to..... may b on t lines of ma first blog:)

Ever done things on impulse,without caring for t consequences?
Ever done things out of passion n dedication than compulsion?
Ever done things out of love?

Because wen u do things lik this, irrespective of whether u succeed or lose, there ll b a feeling of satisfaction and peace. may b i m being philosophical, but t truth is tat wen we ve all our heart in sumthin v ll always do it well....

I once watched a documentary called "secret". It s a movie abt "law of attraction"(nw don let yr perverted minds do t thinkin :P ) its philosophical. there s somethinf g profoundly infulential about tat movie, that it changed t way i looked at life.. after tat movie, i was jus transformed. 

Law of attraction s nothin but if u want sumthin, n want it wit all ur heart, imagine u already have it n visualize. u shud visualize in a way tat u can feel its presence in ur life n u already ve it. then t whole world ll conspire in its own ways to make u get it...

Its true... let me quote an instance wen i made this law of attraction work without knowin abt it...
guess it was 2002..don rember wen..champions trophy match,venue was s.lanka-india vs south africa semi final. india was in pathetic position...it was damn sure S.A wud win...bein a cricket freak n fanatic, i badly wanted india to win...
in 34th over i went into pooja room n sat in front of gods n started prayin....i jus said to myself or rather to god- i ll sit here till t end of t match prayin without watchin t match till 50th over but pl make india win...my concentration was so high, i prayed so hard tat i actually visualised india winnin tat match... n u kno wat :) india did win tat match..guess part timers yuvi n sehwag got wickets out of t blue n india went on to win it...

:) try t same in daily life, n there ll b no dearth for joy...jus wish, ask for it imagine u already ve it n u ll damn sure get it... anythin- be it a car or a job or a galfren or a house or money or respect or anythin...sumthin ll happen...world ll adjust accordingly to ur needs.. thats t marvel of t universe...

nw u shudn b a cynic here n ask ll t world tailor itself to each n every1s need..S it ll...it works accordingly, balances everythin...it can synch wit everyone..Thats t power of it...in fact its scientifically proven too...

bcos, wen u implement law of attaction, all u r doin s to create a positive charge around u, a positive feel,joy n happiness...naturally tat positiveness leads to enthusiasm, enthu leads to hope, hope leads to hardwork n hardwrk leads to success... so in essence t universe makes u wrk n it wrks for u.... 

:D Try this once,n if possible try t watch this documentary... cheers ppl
my nxt blog ll b on "The child in us"
Since getting another pair was outta question next was to do some quick fix.. I did not seem stickable so we decided to pin it up with something. Babloo got some board pins and tried to pin it, punch it ,stand on it and what not! In vain! It was 6 27 and missing this bus meant I had to roam slipper-less in office till 8! Chuck it! He lost hope! He had only one piece of advice for me. Think you are walking to sabarimala and run! Wat else cud I do? I threw the blackies into the bin and raaan! I was feeling the office carpet with my bare feet for the first time.. the A/c cold stairs and the marble lobby too… I was soo embarrassed I could hardly walk. The bus stand was a good distance away and I had to walk all the way bare foot! To top it all, it was raining! I was praying no one would notice and ask me. Thankfully no one I knew came in the way of my run! My boot cut jeans was serving its full purpose today! It was doing the job of hiding my bare feet! Spotted the bus! I ran inside and it started.
Beyond Getting There: What Travel Days Show Us

Today’s guest post is by Gillian at One-Giant-Step.com sums up for me that imperceptible change that happens when you travel… you start appreciating things you never thought you would.  In that process, maybe you even learn a new way to see the world.



Who is it that said “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey”? Nine months of full time traveling has proven to me that this is absolutely true.

Before leaving on this trip the thought of an 8 or 10 hour bus trip was pretty daunting. The longest trips we’d taken were on planes, where they serve drinks and meals and we can pass the time watching movies. Eight hours on a bus, without the same amenities sounded like torture but we jumped in right from the start with a 22 hour ride from Lima to Cusco that, while not the most comfortable ride, got us into the swing of things pretty quickly.

Once we got a routine down…snacks packed, books prepared, podcasts ready…and had determined our favorite seats…on the drivers side, no window bar blocking the view, no children nearby…bus journeys became easy and now travel days are some of my favorite days.



They are a chance for quiet reflection, to leave behind what is past, to think about the place we are leaving and start thinking about how we will remember our experiences there…that great evening we had at the market, the interesting people we met at the cooking course, the horrible bed at the guesthouse. They are a chance to look forward, to anticipate what is coming, and to plan ahead…where will we go next, how will we get there…where will we stay. They are a chance to stare out the window and think about where we’ve been and where we’re going, about past successes and future plans…when else is there a chance to do nothing but quietly think?

Travel days let us learn a little bit about the people and culture of the places we visit. Sitting in an airport, bus station or train depot gives me a great vantage point to see how people relate to each other. Who is traveling with who? Where might they be going, and why? Are they traveling for work, or holiday, or to visit family? Who are they meeting…or leaving behind?

In a small northern Turkish town we witnessed a heart-wrenching goodbye between two young men. Turkish men are very close - it is normal to see them holding hands and embracing each other – and this couple seemed heartbroken to be leaving each other. One boy sat in the seat ahead of us, perhaps on his way to school or military service, his friend stood outside the bus. They spent their remaining time together with hands pressed against the glass, trying to talk through the window and texting each other on their phones. I don’t understand Turkish but is was clear they were going to miss each other terribly.

I like the act of traveling, the moving forward, the getting somewhere. I love watching the scenery slowly change from rolling hills to flat plains, along high twisty mountain roads or perfectly straight desert highways – there is always lots to see. One of my favorite bus rides is still that first 22 hour ride between Lima and Cusco. I will always remember dawn breaking over the altiplano, the smoke rising from the llama herder shacks and the sun glinting off the frost that covered the ground.

There are plenty of stories to be told about dodgy bus trips, or awful plane rides, or the never-ending tuk tuk/minivan/bus/boat combination…what would we do without those stories? But there are also plenty of journeys that are made perfectly lovely…the lemon spritz on Turkish buses, the meals served on Argentinean buses, or the comfy bed on the overnight Thailand train.

Travel days are an integral part of travel. They are filled with possibility and anticipation of what lies ahead. I like the optimism they have, the sense that fun and adventure lie ahead. No matter how long or short the journey they will always be my favorites.
Neither do i have that deep a knowledge about the game to understand nuances.. nor am i sharp enough to rattle out how many runs India won the nth match of the xth world cup by. This blog is not about that.. This blog is to say "Thankyou Sourav" for making cricket that "extra special". I dont know if it would have been the same for me without you. Yesterday, as I was watching the India - Eng ODIs i felt something strange... Its something i have been doin over the last 8 odd years, looking at you on the field.. changing field placements, smiling, frowning, exalting, shirt waving,jumping, puching, yelling,scolding and what not.. and every moment.. was pure joy. I did read somewhere.. "Sourav Ganguly pulled at the heartstrings of the masses like no other cricketer had done before"and I definitely agree.Being responsible for the collective mood of a nation,over such a long duration - fabulous job done.
Then and now…  It's been ages since I have actually written anything here.Had been busy with lots of things apart from work.As i see,my last post here(apart from pics) is about the jhakkas DSN with Anandji.Now when I look back,so much change has come in life.Earlier my behaviour reflected my gloomy feelings of dejection and frustration.How stupid i had been ! And now....the smile is back :)   I'll start off with what i'd been doing post jhakkas DSN.Well, in her book 'The Secret',Rhonda Byrone mentioned the law of attraction according to which an individual's focused positive thinking can result in life-changing results such as increased wealth, health, happiness and more.In Art of Living, we call it the power of 'Sankalpa'.And seriously things happen when you have faith and confidence...Within a month of DSN,i was on my way to Bangalore ashram for an advanced course with Guruji.The calm and serene atmosphere of ashram & Guruji's darshan-amazing !

But that was not all...I experienced Guru Grace in full throttle yet again...In dec,i was again off to Bangalore for three weeks. 21 amazing days @ 21st km...memories to be cherished for a life time! And finally i became an Art of living teacher....it all seems like yesterday! Last week i finished my first basic course.It was amazing to see the transformation in the participants in just six days.Hearing participants' experiences about how just six days made a difference to their lives was unbelievable.so stiff and rigid on the first day and glowing with happiness as they were leaving on the last day...Truly Guru Grace throughout...It's not we who are taking the course,it's HIM !!!

Thanks Guruji for filling our lives with love,joy and enthusiasm !!!

P.S. - Being happy is a practice. Being unconditionally happy is a practice: Come what may, today I'm going to smile. Anyway, everything is going to die! Everything is going to vanish and disappear---so what! Who cares! Let me at least be happy, smile this moment, enjoy my very breath... Sri Sri
History waiting to repeat? -  The family visit to Agra last week was for the benefit of my two young nephews aged 9 and 7 years who had never seen the Taj. Strangely the visit for me turned out to be a morose one. The Taj did not seem as splendorous as it used to. The grandeur of its marble seemed to have been visibly effected, presumably, by pollution since I last saw it around two and half years ago. The badly lit inside was depressing and too claustrophobic. The too well known story of 22,000 craftsmen having their hands cut off upon the orders of the Emperor after the completion of the monument seemed to stain the beauty of the Taj as I looked at it.   Visit to the Agra Fort was no better. How Akbar, the so called ‘emperor’ died suspected to have been poisoned by his own ambitious son Jahangir. How Jahangir blinded his own son Khusraw, a contender for the throne as per Akbar’s will. Shah Jahan, Jahangir’s son killed his own brothers to secure the throne and was finally imprisoned by his own son Aurangzeb in this very Agra Fort ! Listening to the guide giving the tales of treachery, deceit, barbarism, cruelty and ruthless ambition that was played out in these monuments of Moghul historicity, I wondered how this land of Vedic culture based on truth and dharma gave way to such lowly culture of killings, loot, plunder and lust!

Greed, lust, cruelty and barbarism reflected in every story told by the guide. He showed us the phansi ghar in the basement (not open to public so we could just peep in) just below the Jahangiri Palace which incidentally was a place for rest and pleasure for the women in the emperor’s harem. It made me wonder why a phansi ghar was situated inside the living quarters and just below the place where the emperor indulged in pleasures. I was then told by the guide that this was the place where the women (queens) of the harem who fell out in disfavour were tortured and executed! Only a Moghul emperor could drink the choicest of wines and enjoy pleasures sitting atop a dungeon where hapless and screaming women were being tortured and tormented.

Looking down from the Fort we were shown a tank like structure and were curious. The guide related the story. It was a favourite sport of the members of the royal family. Elephants were kept around the tank deprived of water in hot seasons. They were drugged to make them thirstier. In that state after days of deprivation of water, they were led to this tank which was filled with alcohol. As they drank the alcohol, in that inebriated state of extreme thirst, they bloodied each other as the emperor and other royals watched with pleasure!

This was the culture that invaded the land where Sanatan Dharama was practiced. A land where animate and inanimate were revered, where birds, animals and even rivers, mountains were worshipped!

That Hindu India was prosperous and full of riches has been chronicled by various travellers. It was a coveted land. One is told of how rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds were embedded in the walls of the Moghul monuments and mausoleums creating ornate designs. Jewels were set into the floors across the vast marble. The splendour and wealth of the Moghul courts has been narrated over the years. Where did all this wealth come from? Obviously plundered and looted from the people of the land. Babur the first Moghul was a nomad and obviously did not bring it from his country. The wealth was plundered from the temples, state treasuries and the peoples of this land. It was the wealth of the Hindu land conquered by the invaders given to plunder and loot.

Even before Muslims came to India, there were wars and battles between the Kings. There were conquerors and there were the conquered. However, the wars were mainly fought between the martial classes. Strange as it may sound today, the Kings and princes observed time honoured conventions that were sanctioned in Shastras. For example, places of worship were never touched. The Brahmins and the learned were not harmed, women were not violated, and cows were not killed. In fact, non combatant civil population were never killed or captured as the battles were mostly fought in open spaces. The local population was never plundered and war booty was an unknown concept in wars and battles fought then. The kings had a code of honour and violating this code was considered reprehensible and kings found it worse than death.

However, Muslim invaders came with a different code. They would fall upon unarmed, hapless civil population after a victory on the battlefield. They would burn down villages and towns after the defending martial warriors had been killed. They went in for mass murders of the civil population and Brahmins were their special targets. They pillaged and looted even from the bodies of the dead. They raped and captured women who were considered a part of the booty. Those who were not killed were sold as slaves. This was the code of the Muslim invaders – code of their Prophet. They did it all for their Prophet as ‘holy warriors’. The world famous historian, Will Durant has written in his Story of Civilisation that "the Mohammedan conquest of India was probably the bloodiest story in history". The Hindus found it very hard to understand the psychology of this new invader which they were witnessing for the first time in history. If one were to read the chronicles of those times, advent of the Muslims into India became possible only through deceit and treachery and not out of valor or greater prowess.

Then came the British and the plundering of this hapless people continued and more than ever before. It was not a plundering for a short while. It lasted for a full 200 years from the battle Plassey in 1757 to Independence in 1947. So much so that a country which even after being ruled over by the Muslim invaders for so long was considered the “brightest jewel in the British Crown”, at the beginning of the 20th century, India was the poorest country in the world in terms of per capita income! After 1000 years of attacks against Hinduism, India gained Independence but at the cost of partition of the land with hundreds of thousands of Hindus killed and driven out of their homes by Muslim claimants to the North Western part of the country.

Last 60 years India has tried to regain its self with economic progress on all the fronts. Today, it is being projected as the 'Superpower' of tommorrow. It has tried to forgive and forget the wounds afflicted since the days of Mohd bin Qasim. It has been trying to think of a better future for its people. Hindus accepted a large part of Muslim population within even though a separate state Pakistan was carved out as homeland for Muslims. They embraced the followers of Christianity which had bled them and ruled over them for over 200 years. All because Hindu way of life is inherently tolerant and accepts all diversity with a vision of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam (world is one family). However, it has again become a target of these two monotheistic religions. For over a decade now Islamic terrorists have been attacking mainly the Hindu population. The objective of the ‘jihadi’ terrorists is to divide India once again on the basis of religion and create what they envision as Mughalistan. On the other hand, the poor and underprivileged are constantly being targeted by the Christian evangelists, converting them to Christianity against lure of money brought in from the affluent West. These conversions have assumed alarming proportions in the last couple of years.

Is history waiting to repeat itself ?
I am sure all of you are wondering why I call it “Hell-Dia”.Frankly, I have nothing against the place. On the contrary,I quite like this quiet  place.Its not bad at all.But, when the basic amenities are a problem, you fail to see things with rose-tinted glasses.After all, come on,  I’m human.We have adjusted ourselves to this environment and graciously accepted this mundane lifestyle (**sob**) and the pathetic food.Its not fair enough to blame the place but it would be unfair if I don’t blame TCS,UFS,HIT and the other umpteen people trying to provide services to us and making money in the process.TCS and HIT have struck a high-profit business deal at our cost.It is this fact I’m unable to digest.The fact that TCS is showing step-motherly treatment to the 600 of us at Haldia for no fault of ours is something I can’t swallow. We were told that our training is a 35 working-day period, but all of a sudden they say, we’ll have to do our stream training here, which means we are stuck here until May.No confirmed news yet.All credit to TCS for their effective and efficient management practices ( I wonder how people give them awards for good management etc.. bang forehead!).Adjustments work only for a short period.

Time: around 7:30 PM

Vini and I decided to walk our way to the end of the flyover from Prasads Multiplex after watching the Arya-2 movie. "Movie antha pichollene babu!... Arya-2, 'veedu pedda psycho' ani pettalsindhi tag line... nene gani Ajay or Geeta  place lo unte epatiki aa Arya gadini champesi prashantanga jail lo batikesedanni!" and so we went on laughing over our silly jokes( no wonder we enjoyed the craziness of the movie) as we slowly walked down the footpath. It was just like one of those walks we have whenever we meet.. catchin up with each other.. laugh-chattin over everythin from earth to sky(n beyond too ;))..our lives..our plans...our future. For me, this walk though, was a special one. It marked the logical end of carefree lives we've enjoyed so far. Few days hence we were to enter one of the most crucial moments of our lives. Both of us were equally apprehensive and tensed. "I'm sure u'll make it..sometimes ur frens kno more abt u than urself" said Vini .. and I was sure that she would make it. Not knowing what would be the result of influence of external factors upon our future, somewhere inside we were guided by small amount of internal factor- faith.

Its been a little less than 2 hrs since the probable candidates have assembled in the JVC auditorium. Half an hour has turned into another 15 mins.. n 15 mins.. to 15 more minutes and so on. Unable to think of a better way to pass time..I gave a glance over the faces of people. Some looked anxious... some looked dehydrated.. some looked exited.. and few others trying to crack jokes and laugh to overcome the tension ( i was one among them ;) ). Nonetheless, everyone looked like the candidate who would make it. Watever little confidence i had was beginning to fade away. My head was turning into a pool of negative thoughts. I turned my head away and started adorin the walls and the ceiling. There was yet no word  from the authorities.

Meanwhile semester results were declared and not many seemed to care much (i'm the first person here :D ).. except a few who were worried if they got a 10 or 9.99 :P . In order not to realise time.. I started blabbering to my friend n almost told the history of AP since independence to 2 of my friends one after the other( Poor they!) Still  no word! This was heights! Finally, after sometime.. one of staff members came in n told us that the numbers were very good. Huh! wat a relief! Then slowly, one by one, these guys started coming in. There were rounds n rounds of applause n standin ovations to each n every person who came in (just imagine the trauma we went through). For the next 15 mins.. all i remember was clapping for every sentence they uttered. Then came the final moment. Names were being called out branch wise and  CSE came somewhere in... i  don remember where it came! too tensed to notice that.. but it came. Thankfully, the order of names was something which we knew and I was waiting with fingers crossed.
A few names later.... "Geethanjali M" .. there came the most beautiful name at the moment. I realised the importance of a person's name that time ;). The longest 3 hr wait was over.

After a long bus journey, I boarded another bus to Hyderabad. "The number u r tryin to reach is currently unavailable... blah.... blah.....".. I tried a couple of times but the automated voice kept irritating. It was Vini's big day. I called her house n learnt that aunty was in the same situation. After sometime , i called her again n this time she picked it up. Me-"hello"...Vini-"hamma, i got through".

We booked tickets for Avatar, had a nice Frankie and  started our walk down the flyover. There wasn't much of talk this time. We faintly recalled our situation few days back and  ufff! how safe we felt now!.Those crucial moments(apti n interview) we talked of before, ended even before we realised them. We continued our walk till the end  listening to songs and singing our heart out. But our journey, is not to end here. We have just embarked upon a new beginning ;)



P.S:  I will continue my second post in the next one :)
If trying to write a grammatically correct sentence in German is a huge feat in itself, (sentences that are a little more complicated than the ones in German1 or 2) speaking a grammatically correct sentence amidst all the stuttering and stammering is a whole other thing! My oral exam is in two weeks – that’s right – Zwei Woche ! Writing in german is easier because you know the rules and you have time to apply them happily, and you can make use of the famous tips they give in class ! For example, while forming questions you know that the verb goes in the beginning of the sentence and so you can write it in assertive first and then change it. Like… you have a book. Du hast ein Buch. As a question that becomes Hast du ein Buch? I know it seems really simple now, but trust me with Praesens, Praeteritum, Praesens Perfekt , Akkusativ, Dativ,Praepositionen und so weiter … es ist schwierig( difficult). But speaking has to be more spontaneous and there is obviously lesser time to process what you want to say, to search for the most appropriate word , to check the golden grammar rules. Whew! Ironically one of the methods to improve your writing and speaking skills apart from practising dialogues,Reaktionenubungen, etc… is by reading and writing more. And so, as an effort to actually write/speak at least 3 correct German sentences in a row, I am now blogging in Deutsch (or so it seems).
Spring is in the air...you know what that means...no not cleaning!
By Sara on March 16, 2010 9:16 AM | 2 Comments | No TrackBacks
Ah Spring.  Spring is in the air.  Birds are chirping, mud puddles are overflowing and a girl's thoughts turn to ... well boys.  Admit it!  Spring brings a certain 'randyness' to mind - no? 

Every time I write an entry, I see a select list of categories to choose from and 'Dating' is the first one that Jen set up for me.  I never check it off.  And I mean NEVER.  And it glares back at me daily, a constant reminder that my 90 year old grandfather is currently getting more action than me.

Dating scares me.  It brings me back to being a terrified fifteen year old girl with a bad anxiety disorder.  My first 'date' was a lunch with an older guy at school.  We went to Apache Burger where all the cool kids hung out and I promptly threw up from nerves.  It hasn't really gotten better since then.  I'm sort of a dicotomy - I'm outgoing and confident in regular life but give me a first date and I'm a nervous wreck doing vodka shots when the doorbell rings.

In my pre-baby life I used to write a blog that was carried on radio station sites across the country.  It was called WTF and it basically dealt with my ridiculous life - part of it was dating.  People turned it to read deets of the guy who looked like Franklin the turtle and asked to watch hockey in his undies; the writer who humped my leg like a poodle; or the guy who filmed me bowling.  I may have not had a typical 'relationship' for the past decade but I had been having fun.

I've been on one date since I've had Will and I have to admit it my nerves were a little bit better.   I'll attribute this to my care factor of success being much lowered. 

Face it, if the night goes bad...I no longer go home to my empty house and bemoan about it.  I can go home and open Will's door and see the greatest guy ever sleeping like a champ. 

 

 

 

So I've decided to take matters into my own hands and set up an online dating profile.  The thought makes me cringe as I thoroughly believe that 'my type' of guy doesn't do online dating.  BUT - let's face it has my 'type' been working - yeah not so much.  I figure if nothing else, it's fodder for the blog right?
Year 2010 Its been like 5 months since my last post..too much..

So here I am my ' not neglected now' blog! :)

I have been thinking a lot about what should mark the renewal of my blogging space yet again...and like it was/would have been expected..in Jan what would most people like to talk about..atleast most of the mango people...I aint no different (too much amrican angreezi)!
Year gone by...

Well..I guess year 2009 has been one filled with too many shocks..surprises..travel...disappointments..cribbing..a lot of such things..nothing too great on the professional front for sure...but personally it has been good (minor hiccups but its been really goood!)

I think this year there have been a lot of 'self-realisation' moments and some how I am still reeling under the after effects of the same...I think I still have a long way to go to mature as a 'diplomatic professional'!! I really was under this mis conception that I am a good diplomat..but seeing the people around me..I think I am just too much 'on your face' and its not too good for my own health I think! :)

Just some days back, we were asked to take out our Professional hats and put them on..and its a realisation which came in too late into the year, but I think we should never take them out only..just keep them on!! Even though I know that this is how it should be, I still am not sure how to achieve that..and by the way..this is my 'resolution' of the new year!!
But with the people I have around, I am afraid I would be able to go beyong a few months (at max) with this!!!!!!!!

I think I really need to work on it!

This was work..now travel...toooooooo many places....FANTASTIC (In search of a better word! :) )No further disclosers here ;-)

I think I just want to 'think' about my personal life..and not pen it down.......Its so much better just to think about it....:)
Doomsday!!! Inspired By Geetu -  Hey all...after a long time I m finding myself a lot of spare time...so much tat i Dino Wat to do..neway i was reading this post abt doomsday by geets and i felt i shud continue on it....

What exactly is this doomsday...yeah true it is in bible that apocalypse or end of the world will occur...any1 who read lost symbol will kno abt the real meaning, or the meaning perceived by dan brown....apocalypse means the end of the world true...jus tat it is the end of the world as we know it.... if u dig deeper u will understand that apocalypse refers to a major shift - a thought shift or perception shift...that we will understand the world better and see everything in new light....

again " before light, there shall be darkness"...or "before peace there shall be war"
all this doesn signify end of the world but just the shift that is going to happen.. the terrorism, the wars, the ignorance are all the darkness that comes before illumination....

Supporting this, i read sum where on Nostradamus predictions about the end of the world, that end of the world is not the end. Well, being an Indian may b i m favoring this view too much, but he did predict a major or large scale war - the war on terrorism and as it gets nastier, people around the world will lose peace of mind, and the west starts looking towards east. he had actually predicted and upswing of people going towards yoga and spirituality and come to India in search of it...and true to his words, there has been a tremendous increase in people coming towards yoga and cultural centers of India ( google n chk if u want)

for people who want more proof...okiez, chk this out... i forgot where i read it frum..sum scientific site in net oly...well they have clearly explained the phenomenon of polar shift, which many are saying will be causing the doomsday...

see, everything has polarity ryt? well so does the sun.. and earth revolves around the sun...well apart frum this the sun spins around its own axis... and it takes like so many 13000 odd years for sun to complete this spin.. as u see, the time 2012 is apparently the time this spin s going to change... as it changes the polarity of sun also changes.. ryt nw earth is facing the negative polarity of the sun.... but by 2012 it wud ve cum to the positive polarity...this precise moment wen this -ve to +ve change takes place, in between there will be a moment of imbalance or no polarity time, during wen due to lack of polarity and gravity balance b/w earth n sun there can be a possibility where earth is drawn a bit closer to the sun..if it collides wit sum other planet this tym there s a possibility of damage.. and only due to this slow polar shift does all this natural calamities occur.. these will settle down by 2012..so there is only 1/ millionth of possibility that anything bad can happen....

apart from this, the change in polar shift will actually change the world.. it is proven scientifically that everything is energy...due to the negative ions from the sun are our energies negative...wen the polar shift occurs we will be on the positive side and thus the earth will be filled with more positive energy.. and this also falls in line with the dan brown hypothesis and Nostradamus prediction..obviously Nostradamus meant all this spirituality and towards the east as a growth towards ones self or illumination..and hence we also look at the world in a new light....

n yeah, the well theorised and scientifically proven astrology will become wrong if doomsday is true...shudn all our lifelines end @ 2012 then...shudn all our horoscopes predict a disaster and end of our lyf? cummon people there s so much proof against dooms day to believe it

okay! to conclude i would like to say this...there is law of attraction..sumthin i mentioned in my previous post...yeah i m influenced by this movie "secret"..but its true.. it works..more the people believe doomsday, which they do thanks to the Internet n its hype, the more they are gonna attract it by their negative thoughts...its proven our thought have mass and they generate energy....so spread this..believe truly and have faith that 2012 is jus a change in our view of the world n not the end of the world... :) cheers
Galicia (Part 2)
February 28, 2010
Because I liked Todd's wine so much and because it seemed as if he was a lone ranger kind of guy, I was interested to know what his Galicia looked like.

I knew the commercial face, a lot of wine I couldn't drink. Gallo is rules there with its brands like Martin Codax and Kendall-Jackson is buiding a big estate --plantations are underway. I had been warned by the marketing arm that organic is very difficult in Galicia,so wet, I was told.

 See the celery green part of the map north of Pontevedra? That's the region, the Val do Salnes.


First to his vineyards. Todd wants very much to focus on single vineyard albarinos. This was in his organic one--the kind of organic they say is so hard to do ;) in back of a church. The spongy, healthy soil---with diviets from the massive amounts of rain--was filled with thyme and mint and chunks of remarkable red/pink granite. 

I never saw this kind of granite in soil, gorgeous stuff and they were all around. To see them in the sun might have been exquisite, like TinkerBells in the vineyard. But it was as green as Ireland and as soggy.

Inside his winery, in front of the Xoan vineyard, Todd took me through the wines, but first he had a sip of chocolate milk.



Now, he's only been making wine since 2003, and is figuring it out. But he has talent. Definitely has talent. One of his odd ideas involves that chocolate milk --and yes you can say I'm a tease--go ahead--and that he often does not destem.

Once again, I shock myself with my lazy notes. It is so hard to pull myself from conversation to write, if there was only a way to record my thoughts. Where is the iPhone microphone for the brain?

The 2005 Bemil was extremely creamy on the nose and punchy with mandarin with a slight reduction, in a way that seems compelling, that note that I say is like halitosis--but in a good way.

The 2004 Bemil had a bit of spritz, a cold metal finish and more mandarin.

The 2005 Saiar was tangeriney and had some oxidation.

2008 Saiar, bitter arugula greeness with pineapple and the hintiest of tropical but NOT tropicale, if you know what I mean?

Notes are silly. What's the point. Here's what's important. He's in the rarity of folk working with native yeast. All of the wines had brilliant acidity, enough to please acid freaks around the world, enough tangerine, mandarinity to mark it's difference and a freshness that is lacking in so many of the modern Albarinos.
Last week, I felt like a real mum. OK so I've got a 4 year old boy, of course I'm a mum. But sometimes I catch sight of myself in a shop window holding his hand, and I think How did I get here? Now I sound like a Talking Heads song, but you get the drift. Do any of you feel like that ever? 

The first time Elf called me Mummy was a defining moment in my new mummy status. When I went back to work after my year's maternity leave, I was seen differently by new and old colleagues, as I was now a mum. 

But last week, my mum-o-meter hit new heights - I have finally made it. And why? I sewed Elf's first badge on his hoodie! No it wasn't his first ASBO; I dealt two of those out at the tender age of two, and there was no corresponding badge.

Elf achieved Badge 1 for Trampolining. Woody and Jessie achieved theirs too. I sewed it on a bit wonky and half way through, I asked my Other Half if the badge was in fact and iron on one! It wasn't.
excessssssssss - again i becam a copy cat of abhyu....
oops...
wateva...
had got an idea frm abhyu n writing for abhyu 
dis s gonna be a 10 min post...
hehheheh

excess 
he says nethin taken in excess s bad..
and gives an event of him eating in excess due to parental love... and suffering frm it.

if we try for sumthin great we may land up few steps behind.
and being postponement one of the greatest virtues of all the human beings (exceptions are always there i m talkin abt d lame commmon ppl hehhehe) deadlines has to be fixed well ahead in order to complete them in time on time r atleast after time...
had d excess amt of time nt provided dere ll dey do it asap??

i had been to the sastra semester abroad programme for US universities last week and the person concerned has asked d members interested to send their bio data for applying.. u believe or not the first question asked by most of the ppl is "sir when s d last date to apply?" y ll d ppl think only abt d deadlines and d tasks ll b done only wen d case becums do r die...

and one more most observable thing s one night study before d exam 
n everyone knows dat exam at mrng 9 one night study ll go 
exam at 2 in d mrng 3 hrs study ll do..
hahahha
observing and analysing nature of human beings s always interesting...

p.s. EXCUSE ME WID D SPELLINGS AND CASE... :)
Life's a Zoo
7 different opinions from people other than me 8/15/2009 05:05:00 PM erratically written by Ultragrrrl 
 
I'm running on about 4 hours sleep today, which is making me somewhat zombie-fied. A little over a week ago I was laying in bed, sick as a dog, unable to answer emails, talk to anyone, have any sort of conversation... it sucked. But at least I'm not sleeping because I've been running all over town, taking advantage of a gorgeous Friday -- and one of the last of the Summer.

One of my favorite things in life are animals. Not only are they delicious, but they're adorable as well. I try to make it to the Central Park Zoo at least once a year, if I can, to just walk around and check out what they've got. It's not much, but it satiates my appetite enough to make me feel somewhat OK with the fact that I haven't been to the Bronx Zoo in about 18 years. I went through a phase where I hated zoos and found them to be evil and cruel for taking animals out of their habitat and plucking them down in the middle of a pen for everyone to see -- but my opinion has since changed. The wild is dangerous with poachers, over expansion, and pollution. At least in these pens, these animals are somewhat safe. My biggest concern is their boredom, as I'm sure looking at people all day is not as exciting for them as it is for me. If anyone has any opinion on the subject of animals in Zoos, I'm open to hear and potentially learn, from your opinion.

Anyways... photos from yesterday:

My boyfriend and I at the Zoo:

Here are the penguins. My boyfriend says I walk like a penguin and he's not entirely wrong:
After the zoo we went to the BMW dealership to check out some bikes and then had an amazing Indian food dinner at this spot called Indigo Bistro in midtown east. I think it's going to be our new regular spot since the service was AMAZING and the food was delicious. They brought us free vegetable fritters, me a free mango lassi, and made a special dish for my boyfriend who couldn't decide what he should get! Happy Indian indepedance Day, by the way!

Apres dinner I hopped over to Art Bar to meet up with my friend John Dirschel for his birthday and was delighted to see his twin brother Brian as well! In high school I was soooo in love with John Dirschel, as were all my friends. He was so cute and looked like Kurt Cobain with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I was a tomboyish runt in high school and everyone just saw me as one of the boys. I had mostly guy friends who considered me their best friend/little sister, and John was one of those guys. I was his lil' sis that he'd wrestle and mess around with... and meanwhile I would dream of a day that he would see me as more than a friend and ask me out. But he was 2 years older than me and left for college when I was a sophomore and soon he joined the Coast Guard, cut of all his hair, and toured the world. I remember seeing him in 2006 when he was on break and he was jacked up. I couldn't believe my scrawny Kurt-esque high school crush was now a real-life man.

He's since left the Coast Guard (or leave of absences? whatever it's called when you don't have to go on tour anymore) and getting his Masters degree in LA and is now way smaller but super toned from doing exercizes that make him secretly strong. When he lifts me up in the air, I basically float. It's so wonderful to be able to see him from time to time and catch up on our lives. We live such different lives but are still insanely connected with many of the same intersts. Anyway, it was really great seeing him this time around since the last time I was with him was when Brandon called me to tell me that our friend Vinny had passed. John was a wonderful shoulder to cry on at that moment, but for whatever reason, it left me nervous to see him again.

Here's a photo of me with the Dirschel boys. Brian is on the left and John is on the right. They're identical and two of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet in your life:
At about 2 or 3 am we left Art Bar and went to Electric Lady Land studios to visit Courtney Love who is there recording. Hole's songs are turning out amazing and really right up there in the realm of Live Through This (my favorite Hole album... according to my boyfriend it's because I was an angry teenager when it came out, and it's a tortured and angry record) and Celebrity Skin. They were recording a cover song -- I can't say which one just yet cos it might be a secret -- and the boys and I were there to be a peanut gallery and talk about quantum physics. I saw a ghost recently and Micko Larkin, the Hole guitarist, heard one sing into the mic at the studio lastnight... so we exchanged real-life ghost stories. I don't think I've gone crazy, but there's a jury out on that.

Anyway, the bathroom at Electric Lady Land is super cool, so Courtney and I took pics of each other. I think this will be my album artwork one day in my fantasy life:


And here's Courtney:
At about 5:30am, Brian and I called it a night and he came over to mine to crash and provided a wonderful dose of entertainment in the morning as Gurj was packing to move out of the legendary 3A apartment.

It's the end of another era.
OK, so I may have overpainted the serious and boring self-portrait at the end of my last post. That's certainly not the whole of who I was.

But religiously speaking, a "scared escapee from life" who also happened to love to sing hymns and was drawn to the aesthetics of Episcopal liturgies--that's pretty accurate.

And my "deal" with God to protect me from heartbreak if I stayed away from intimate relationships and sex--well, let's just say that was more the ideal in my head than the reality in practice. The reality involved some pretty confused and confusing romantic relationships--some of them more or less platonic, some of them half-platonic (i.e., from my side of the table, not from the male side), and some of them more or less non-platonic except that sex was a contested arena, a kind of battleground, both within myself and with a male partner in those days.

Suffice it to say that this was not the most healthy or wholesome way to approach ordination to the priesthood. And how did that even come into the picture?
I’m Ellie, a 30 something mum of two beautiful little people, Big E aged 3 & Little E aged 9 months, and wife to my long suffering husband Mr H.

We live in the UK in somewhere Yorkshire.

I’m currently on the last few weeks of my maternity leave, and am loving being a second time mum, although no-one told me it’d be this much like hard work. They’re worth every sleepless night!

I’m an ‘experimental’ cook and Jamie Oliver fan (if you haven’t got his Ministry of Food book go get it!), love reading but don’t get much chance, which is probably a good thing as I currently have the concentration span of a potato. I’m also enjoying trying my hand at writing (’tis quite cathartic you know), I’m Twitter addicted and love, love, love blogging.

I used to paint in a former life when I was an art student (my favourite artist is Degas) and randomly took up knitting when I was pregnant with Little E (I’m actually quite good!).
My coversations with God 1 God are you smiling? I am sure its fun for You ;) but but..I hope You make sure its just fun for me too..You have seen me do this before..are You not bored of it?
Please keep me closer..you know when I need you to give me a tight hug!
Love you.

And I am trying to beat all physical distractions. But God you will have to take care of my mind..you know how useless it is ;) Please..I hope you are not having a good laugh right now!! [The emoticon I want to use here is :P but I think you might not like it!!]

Contd. 24th Aug 2009

And yeah, thanks for being so attentive to details - you know what I mean. I will flatter myself and think that you have all the time in the world (pun intended) to actually post url errors to me - Marvellous.
Lots of love!

Contd. 27th Aug 2009

pretty please..
2 New Teeth, Crawling, and Self-Pacifier-Weaning
How's that for a title?

Eli finally cut his 2 top front teeth this past week. They'd been bumps there forever and they finally made their way through. Can I tell you how hard it is to catch those two little teeth on camera though? Very hard. This is as close as I got:
And yes, Jeremy is holding him upside down so I could get this. Luckily Eli thought that was a blast. The left one came in first and a couple days later, the right one joined in. Very exciting. And it looks like there are several more also on their way. Fun fun!

Next up: crawling. Eli took his first few real forward crawls today (crawls? they're not steps; i don't know what you call them). He's been scooting, rolling, army crawling, getting on his hands and knees, going backward, and so forth, but today we saw the first glimpses of the real deal. He takes a few crawls (again, that sounds so weird) and then drops to his tummy again for the army crawl, but I'm sure he will be crawling the length of our house in no time. :) I managed to catch a bit of it on video (please ignore my encouraging sounds - I hate hearing myself on video, but I forget to shut my mouth when I press record; and it's really short because I ran out of memory).
 
And last but not least...no more pacifier! At least I think so. It seems like I got off way too easy, so I'm not sure if we've really seen the end of it here, but it appears so. I usually only would give Eli his pacifier when he went to sleep and when we were at church (they should call it a "muter"); oh, and sometimes when I teach lessons. Anyway, but lately he has refused it at bed time so I just stopped giving it to him and he hasn't seemed to miss it at all! I was planning on trying to wean him from it soon anyway, but I certainly didn't think it would be this easy. Here's hoping it's really over! I should just throw them away and then it really will be over...hmm. We'll see.

So that's the update! This boy's changing fast! He pulls himself up to stand a lot now too. It's so fun to see him growing up. He'll be running around by the time the warm summer weather gets here. Yea!!!
This is my studio. Not just another room in the house. It holds all that is me. My studio is both my consolation and refuge. It is here, that I am me. My feelings, my fantasies, my emotions are buried in these paintings. All my desires are entombed here, suffocated in this very room. I acknowledge them when I am inside the studio and leave them behind when I leave. It happens to be a convenient arrangement for someone with a detached and troubled personality as I. For days, I forget to even eat and remain within this room. No, it doesn’t confine or restrict me. It is outside these four walls that I feel confined. I have to be someone else. I have to act like the someone else people expect me to be. Rather strange, but when I am working in my studio, I feel in control. I am aware of my feelings and I am in touch with my inner self. Is this what they call Nirvana? Yes, I have found my true love. My studio. Warning: Doesn’t have anything to do with me. I am only as artistic and nimble as a chicken.
God Save The Queen
If I seem a little quiet lately, not as chatty, not posting on other people’s blogs as much as usual, it’s because March is a tough month. 27 years ago, March started out great with the birth of my daughter, then it quickly went down hill when my husband died 11 days later. Today’s his birthday, in fact. He’d have been 51. 

It doesn’t help that right now I’m “Emily” and “Shawna” on bogus diet websites that use my before and after photos (and photos of my grandchildren!!) and a fabricated story that I used colon cleanses, resveritrol and acai berries to lose weight. You know and I know that isn’t true, but there are thousands of folks who see my before and after photos on those sites and think it’s really how I did it. And they’re getting ripped off because of it. Pardon my language, but this really pisses me off.

When I was a kid, I rarely stuck up for myself. I allowed people to say some pretty cruel things about me or my beliefs without me putting up much of a defense. I’d defend my friends, and when I had children, I was always their protector, but when it came to me, it was like I didn’t matter. 

When I took on the task of losing weight, I never imagined so many inner demons would line up to fight to justify their existence in my life, and lately the more I meditate, the more I realize the ways I remain the queen of acquiescence. 

The folks who stole my image to make a profit are no different than the boys who called me fat, the girls who threatened to not be my friend if I didn’t give them candy from my dad’s store, or even my ex-husband (not the one who died) who tossed me around a time or two. They are all bullies, and ignoring them – which was always the advice I got – didn’t make them go away. 

It’s ironic that my weight is the crux of the issue with my cyber bullies, only the problem now is that it’s expensive to take on these bullies. Words – at least ones sent by me – aren’t enough. I had to hire an attorney to fight these jerks, but two of the sites are based in the UK and so my new BFF (or rather, bloke) will probably be an attorney in London who is an associate of my attorney in Pittsburgh. Helluva time to have gone to a cash-only budget, eh?

Most of us at some point have encountered bullies. I’m curious who yours are and how you handled them. Did your weight hold you back? Where do you find your confidence?

March sucks, and I’ll probably cry about this later tonight. I might even scream into my pillow. But know that I really appreciate you listening.
After migrating to Singapore and living in a world sans TV, if there’s one thing I miss about the small screen, it’s got to be the advertisements! My love for Indian ads started out when I was a very small and rather annoying kid. I was hyper all the time. And I used to play this game called “Guess the Adu” with my dad. It was pretty simple. Basically, when an advertisement began we had to guess the brand/product before it got announced in the ad, and whoever guessed it right first got 1 point. The first person to reach 10 points was the winner. I used to win all the time of course. (Truth is, my dad would play the game primarily to shut me up. Perhaps the fact that I threw tantrums when I lost also had something to do with my successive victories.) I’ve always found advertisements very attractive and fascinating. I even surf channels looking for new commercials. There are awfully creative ads (Saint –Gobain types) and there are some really stupid silly ones, which nevertheless, I enjoy laughing at. Then there are the oh-so-cute ones (like the Hutch puppy) and the jingles (Titan, Airtel, Doodh Doodh). There are also patriotic (Lead India)and for-a-cause ads(Aaj Tak). Ads with megahuge brand ambassadors, witty taglines, stupid taglines, no taglines and periodically changing taglines.  When I sit and think about old commercials now, I noticed I am able to recall the absolutely lame and inane ones as easily as the witty ones. For instance, I loved “Illathin yezhil vannam” ; the well-known jingle by Nerolac. I didn’t really enjoy the one by Nirma: “Washing Powder Nirma”. Yet that’s what came to my mind first. :O
Summer vacations are nothing new.. I ve been enjoying them every year. But this time it was different. That was because holidays after twelfth boards is like a never ending pit filled with one element - Boredom. But i realised one thing this summer. Dogs are the best companions of man! I spent all my time pampering two of the most adorable dogs in the world. They re Jeeves and Billiken. Though it was a little irritating now and then , i thoroughly enjoyed myself . They both walked into my lives as mere street dogs but now they mean more than anything else to me. One fine January morning , i spotted a white and brown dog sleeping under a two-wheeler. It looked so much like 'Shengu' ( Our old dog who left us sobbing on the 20th of November, 2005) . We started feeding him and officially accepted him as a part of our family. I was quite obsessed with P.G.Wodehouse's books then , so i named him Jeeves .
Colors aren’t always the best thing to happen! It is often their absence which holds more promises to me. Colors, with their exuberance and fulfillment, are more intoxicating than is the serene sense of being colorless. The tangles that colors often tie me in bring about hopes and expectations which I am often not capable to meet. The more spectral hues cause higher degrees of trauma to surround me in a state of clinching fear. It is a state of crisis I go through on knowing that the absence of colors is no where near. Getting routinely habitual hues can be disturbing to a stable mental state of thoughts.  Religiously being exposed to such luxury is instantly welcomed with open arms. But, only till that instant when you don’t lose your self to the comfort of not knowing yourself. Accepted in the initial stage, this unfamiliarity tends to be damaging with gradual effect. The only hopes that I then hold are the subtle recovery of my stability to support me enough to know myself further and better. And that is where the colorlessness seems more attractive than ever before!
Dinner News
We cooked our first chicken....and no I don't have any pictures. My husband said it was time to get rid of a few roosters. He has experience in this, so he just jumped right in and started with "crooked tail." I told my family not to name the chickens, but some of them ended up with names anyway. Crooked tail was one that they incubated themselves. Something must have gone wrong in the egg turning department. He was crooked, he had a crooked tail (hence the name), he crowed crooked, he walked crooked, and a crooked breast bone. My kids unfortunately went outside at a bad time. Ben came in and said "I am mad at dad!" I tried to explain to him why it was happening, he responded "I am x-ing your words mom" Good thing I am not an Internet site to be x-ed off. They were both very upset but eventually they calmed down. I was very surprised at how little meat was on this chicken, not enough for dinner. The children have refused to eat any. I never thought that raising animals would encourage my children to become vegetarians. Time will only tell. I have a chicken recipe that I am hopeful will entice them to eat chicken again.
A few nights ago over dinner my children started having a conversation about poop. Usually that kind of talk is only allowed in the bathroom at our house, but this conversation wasn't about human poop. Lucy was telling Ben about the nature walk she went on and some poop she saw. Excitedly he asked "what did it look like?" She went on to describe it and he confidently responded "it was fox poop!" My husband and I were trying to stifle our laughter long enough to ask them to change the subject. I never thought that I would hear my children having such a conversation. I am not an animal person, or a big outdoor person for that matter. But people change, learn, and grow. And these little people that have come into my life have their own interests and they love animals and the outdoors.

Eggs
How much would you say these eggs cost?



These are fresh, organic, free range eggs. And right now they cost about 6 dollars an egg. We are finally collecting eggs from our chickens. It took Jared a few days to find all of their spots, but now we are collecting between 8-10 eggs a day. I have to tell you they are pretty tasty, I don't know about $6 tasty. That price should go down as they continue to lay. It has been an adventure and will likely continue to be one! Bring on the egg recipes!
Busy …

Haven’t been blogging much this week (I hate it when bloggers give excuses about why they haven’t been blogging) because I’ve been so busy with the renos at the tattoo shop and also planning for a catering job I did this weekend. I couldn’t blog about the catering job because I didn’t want to ruin the surprise!!
I don’t do a lot of catering gigs – they are a lot of work and I’m lazy. *laugh* Just kidding. Kind of. Actually I don’t do a lot of catering gigs because I’m usually asked to do large events (over 100 people) and it’s kind of a drag (for me) to cook for that many people so I’ve been saying NO a lot lately. Plus I’ve been trying to re-charge my creative batteries by staying out of the kitchen and working on other things.
But a few weeks ago I got a lovely letter from Robyn who told me it was her girlfriend Jenni’s birthday (who’s a big fan of the cookbooks) and she and her friends wanted to hire me to be Jenni’s birthday present and prepare them a birthday dinner for 12.
The letter was so endearing and full of love for her friend Jenni that the more I thought about it … the more I couldn’t say no. Best of all the dinner would be here in Victoria (no traveling), the ingredients would be taken care of by Adam & Daisy (the owners of The Root Cellar and best friends of the birthday girl) and I could bring Gerry to be my helper.  :)
I especially wanted to bring Gerry w/me because he could be my “buffer/body guard”. You never know what people/strangers are going to be like … and this group could have turned out to be a bunch of weirdos. Luckily they turned out to be AWESOME and we had a whale of a good time.  :)
I showed up early to prepare the appetizers and then Robyn dressed me up in ribbons and bows and I hid in the dining room waiting for Jenni to arrive. When she knocked on the door I jumped out and Jenni was so shocked to see me she started crying. YAY! I love making people cry with joy!!

After the initial excitement of me being “the present” was over … the girls went downstairs to go get dressed up and I started cooking in the kitchen. To make things easier for myself I did most of my prep at home the day before and in the morning of the party and had everything ready in zip-lock bags and ready to go for when I got there. That way I could walk into the kitchen, throw the ingredients into the pot and start cooking …

The Menu:
Appetizers:
-Tapenade w/crusty bread – (pg 63 – La Dolce Vegan)
-Pesto pinwheel puffs (pg 55 La Dolce Vegan)
-Stuffed cherry tomatoes with Olivada (pg 58 La Dolce Vegan)

Dessert:
-Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie (pg 153 – How It All Vegan 10th ann edition)

I doubled or tripled the recipes and there was more than enough for everyone (including Gerry and myself). I wasn’t able to get a lot of good photos as the lighting wasn’t great and I was REALLY busy making sure the food got to the table but I managed to take a few …

Happy Birthday Jenni!

Me and The Girls!  :)

It was such a fun night … Love, love and more love was in that room. Jenni, Robyn, Daisy and all their friends were gracious, funny and really fun to hang out with. I was truly honoured to be a part of their intimate family/friends birthday dinner.
And BIG THANKS to The Root Cellar for all the ingredients.
If you Victorian’s haven’t been – The Root Cellar is located at 1286 McKenzie Ave. I’m ashamed to admit that I had never been there before because it’s a bit of a drive from where I live … but the quality of their produce is soooo worth the drive. I can’t wait to go back and shop for myself!! :)
I had an unusual media epiphany last week, and it had nothing to do with Trafigura, Jan Moir or the balloon boy, whatever that last one was all about. No, what happened was this. I was sitting on a train, reading an article in the financial pages of the Guardian, on my way to a conference in Exeter. So far, so unremarkable. The article was about WH Smith's business plans. It's going to open 80 new outlets inside office buildings, based on the success of a number of shops it's set up inside hospitals. Profits are up at WH Smith, the article added, thanks to the canny strategies of its CEO, Kate Swann. It was at that point that I had my epiphany. Here was an article in a newspaper about a successful FTSE 250 company that happens to have a female CEO. Not only that, but it had been written by a female journalist (Julia Finch), and was being read by a female business person (me). And yet at no point was the gender of the reader, writer or subject made an issue. The article didn't appear in the women's pages, or in a glossy women's supplement.
One year since a disaster...
Its been a year since the attack took place in Mumbai... the suddeness of that attack left us all thinking about the status of our security... so who is to be blamed? Is it our Government, the Pakistani Government, the Terrorists, the Indian navy???? well, i sincerely feel the problem lies with us.. yes each one of us... surprised.. i'll tell you how..
Jus think and answer this question... how many times have you laughed recently, a true laugh from ur heart..? how many times did you smile, a smile that reached your eyes? how many times did you engage in some activity with passion? how many times did you do something which gave you real happiness? how many people have felt happy because you're in their life? did you actually make a positive difference to anyone's life in the recent past? Scan your thoughts and tell me whether you think more of positive thoughts or negative ones?
I'm sure most of the people around will have unsatisfactory answers to the above questions...
There's a serious problem with our lifestyle, we care for nothing and no one, we just think of the work we have, our ambitions, our problems, nothin else.. we are so wrapped in ourselves to even think of others- our family, our friends, our near and dear ones... leave alone the society and the nation...
There's no spirit of living anywhere... its only survival of the fittest... a rat race where all of us are competing... some of us without even realising why we are here and some are left wondering whether they even belong to this world...
so how does all this relate to the title of this post???( i hear you asking:) )
wat do you when u r irritated on a day? u show that irritation towards someone else.. and that someone to somebody else..
This continues as a reaction.. and as you might have read in thermodynamics(even if you haven't), the disorder in the universe keeps increasing.. and hence all the anger keeps adding up and then when its too much it jus shows up somewhere..
you are wondering wat i'm probably blabbering, but that's how it is.. the earth, nature and the whole universe perform and respond to our emotions through events...:)
You might have noticed that positive things happen to you when you're happy and wen u r already angry, something keeps happening to make it worse...
So, the anger and contempt and indifference we have built around us, that which surrounds us like a second skin is what is making the world respond to us with hatred... 
What do we do about it..? I'm definitely not going to preach about humanity and compassion... We need a renaissance, a change within ourselves, a change in our attitude, our perception, the way we look at the world...
We need more positivity in our thinking... passion and purpose for all our actions... love towards all our fellow beings.. admiration towards nature...and contentment in our heart..........
If each one of us were to follow this, all hatred would vanish and the world would be a much better place to live in...
An evening in London Venue – Bromley South, Kent
Kent is a home county for London. 7 such counties surrounding London have been identified as Home Counties which constitute some kind of a Greater London. It is similar to having a National Capital Region in India. London lies in the South East of England. 

Craig: British from Preston, Lancashire (It’s the same county for Manchester). Lancashire is in North West England. The size of this island (including Ireland) is quite small; it ranks 78 on the list of countries sorted by area. The distance between Preston and London is somewhere between 200-300miles. The distance between Agra and Lucknow is 225miles. The reason for giving all these statistics in Craig’s introduction is that Craig very deeply felt that people in the North West are far better than the people in South East. I was amazed at how difference could arise within a matter of couple of 100 miles. A distance which is hardly significant in a country as large as India. 
Craig quite openly expressed how ‘up in the north’ people think logically where as in the South they are so illogical. ‘It is so difficult to make them understand’. As an outsider I can never imagine one English man to be less logical than another just because he is from down South. He had been completely stressed out by the London Tube (which can be bewildering for any first timer I must admit) and almost cursed the City. 
The entire ordeal seemed to be worsened by the fact that it was a sunny day at 19 degrees. He was red and sweating (like a pig?). I was quite suspicious of his several sneezes due to spreading Swine Flu. 
He must have been in his late thirties and looked like one of the many victims of recession in this country. Though his demeanour was nothing like a victim. He tried to assert himself and tried to make his presence felt by asking for adjusting the air conditioning of all the rooms we were taken to, water and tea. He mentioned how much he had been working on the tests and could solve any problems thanks to his logical thinking. Even between tests he felt necessary to announce how he did so well and that it was so simple if you could just think logically.
This could well be an animated effort from the numerous videos on internet telling you to be at ease and confident about yourself at assessment centres. My reaction to him ranged from pity for he had to come to a graduate recruitment to ‘please shun this attitude’.

Imran: I cannot comment on his nationality. Reason being he had come to England as a toddler perhaps from Pakistan. He was also from Manchester, but a different Uni. I had seen him outside the venue sceptical of entering the building. Finally when he did come inside and I tried to give him a smile but he was clearly quite uneasy and started looking in a different direction after a sheepish smile. It took another boy and 10 minutes to finally get him to tell his whereabouts.
I think his appearance needs to be described here for the sole reason that it was a big part of his personality (and I doubt, his existence). He wore large glasses in an outdated frame. He had longish hair forcibly combed backwards to appear clean. He had a beard which was jet black in colour and went way down his chin. His suit gave away the fact that it was borrowed from a healthy, taller person as he was extremely thin. He was evidently a little withdrawn from other candidates and had been looking for a job for more than a year now. 
I didn’t get to spend much time with him as we were divided into different groups. But as soon we were taken for the first test he folded his trousers up to reveal his mismatched socks and ankles. I do not understand this habit/requirement of Islamic dressing but it did feel a little awkward to do so in a formal environment while wearing a suit. 
Imran was a kind of person whom you feel like knowing about because some how he seemed to have held so much behind those glasses and the beard.

Chaitanya: Fellow Indian from a remote place at 4 hours distance from London. I am yet to familiarise myself with the naming conventions for places in England. There is a Salford in Manchester, so I am not sure if there could be a different Salfordshire County somewhere in the South. 
I saw him too, outside the venue. He sat under a tree waiting for the time to go in. I believe both of us had arrived a tad too early for British standards (You got to be on time, not a minute before not a minute late). 
I suspect he made an effort to exchange a smile before going in but I escaped behind my red book. Chaitanya is from Hyderabad, AP (I can tell a Hyderabadi from a distance fairly accurately:)). He saw my name on the visitor’s books and started the conversation. He was pleasant to talk to and frankly made me ease out a bit. However during the group activity though he was unexpectedly passive. I deliberately tried to include him in the discussion on 2 occasions which I think he took pretty well. 
At the end of the day we left the building together asking each other to be in touch. (Just a casual British pleasantry to exchange)
Chaitanya is pursuing an MBA and I was surprised that he applied for this job. 


Daniel: British from Cambridge. Cambridge is not far from London. But it may take an hour and half with public transport. He reached late and I met him directly in the exam room. This pretty much limited our interaction. 
Nothing to do with him, is my excitement of meeting anybody named Daniel. It started well before coming to UK when during one of my numerous therapeutic conversations, S(P) and I decided that I would meet a Daniel here who would be my knight and S(P) would be enchanted by a Sophie :). 
So with the name Daniel I associate some expectations. And when I do meet some Daniel, I smile to myself remembering our random conversations and the good it does to me – always :)
But this Daniel seemed to be particularly unlike my Daniel. He had a running nose (another suspicion of Swine Flu) and was shivering (out of nervousness?). He had a freckled face and curly red hair. Not a fault of his of course, but somehow I feel that red hair are too doll-like. I blamed him for not being the Daniel and then laughed at my own stupidity. 

Xang (assumed) and MEA (name not known) were the other 2 candidates. Xang was from Birmingham and hardly spoke. MEA (Middle East, Europe & Asia) has been so called as he appeared from a Middle Eastern country with an accent. I could be wrong and he could well be an East European with dark hair. I didn’t have much chance to talk to them. 
They were pretty much a part of the group, rather than individuals.

I think the best part of coming to UK so far has been to be able to meet so many different people both in terms of nature and nationalities.
I recently discovered that I just love to eat. No I am not fat. But I am just loving food now more than I ever did in my life. I don’t know why. Is it because I am totally relaxed with my life that I can finally focus on the food I eat ? Hmm…no not really. My life is not what I would describe as “relaxed” at any level. But still…I am loving food. For instance, there was this simple curd rice, with Ruchi’s mixed vegetable pickle, and mango for lunch and it took a lot of effort to keep me from licking the plate! It’s the combination of the sourness of the curd and the “hot”ness of the pickle with the sweetness of the mango I guess. I’m still dreaming about it. Oh that pineapple rasam rice with ground-nut thovayal and potato chips. Ahh…What a heavely combination. My stomach felt soo happy after it. Today for lunch there was this special cauliflower manchurian that was made for my little niece. I secretly stole a piece and it was just fabulous. The mild aroma of ginger and the sweet-hot sauce with that delectable chinese-food fragrance. Faanntaasstic.  I can go on an don…the bisibelabath that I had for lunch, with a side of sepankelangu fry, the spinach masiyal yesterday, the simple dal and ghee…. I guess I better watch my weight.
The random stats we share...but maybe shouldn't?!
By Sara on March 12, 2010 3:53 PM | 3 Comments | No TrackBacks
I never wanted to be one of 'those moms'.  You know the ones that can take the topic of a conversation and somehow squeeze in a cute little anecdote about their kid?

Sara - 'Did you hear the new White Stripes?  It's awesome.'

Crazy Mom - 'If you want to talk awesome and white, you should see the painting that Little Billy did at school of this sheep.  Kill-ah.'

Sara - 'Waiter - beer please'.

Well, I guess considering I'm writing this blog, that I'm one of those moms.  I tend to do this most often at work, I think because I miss the boy.  There are times though, like at our book club, that speaking of our kids is taboo - we need to cover more important topics like body waxing and south american wines - oh and the book, right, the book. 

The thing that kills me though is when people you don't know share random stats with you about their kids.  Like totally out of the blue. (ugh - just noticed my finger is totally green from some cheapo ring that I bought...that ain't pretty).  SEE!  A random thought like that!

Will and I were at the library the other night.  He was choosing what book he would torture me with for the next week and I was trying to hide the container of raisins that he was illegally eating.  I was eavesdropping on this couple who were reading to their young baby.  They were discussing how they would teach her to pronounce her "r's" (huh?  I just want Will to say some words, I don't give a rats ass how he pronounces them).  Anyway, Will wanted to say hi to the baby so we ventured over.  This led to a bizarre exchange.  Well, exchange by them to me, where I stood looking back and forth like a tennis match until the librarian came over and booted them out for talking so loud.

They asked how old Will was and I told them...and the flood started.  In a matter of seconds, I learned where the babies outfit and sling came from, that she sleeps through the night and had for months (no, no, no people some of us weren't that lucky, and we REALLY dislike these stories) OH and that she can play the organ for twenty minutes at a time.

Maybe it was good for me to run into them because it made me realize that not everyone wants to hear every little thing about your kid - even if you think it's totally adorable (like how Will now has to sleep with the book that he picked out which is literally as tall as him).  Ugh...I did it again.  I guess this post was nothing more than another chance to tell you cute stories about my kid....I better get him started on an instrument stat.
What? No escape? I thought that I would be able to get up and down if I needed to. When I heard I couldn't leave the pit of hell, I almost fainted! I started to get an anxiety attack. 110  minutes of this heat would surely kill me right? Well, almost. I didn't die. But it was NUTS. And towards the end, I couldn't put my head lower than my heart without almost fainting. So I took it easy for the last half hour and poured the droplets of water I had left in my bottle over my head as soon as I left the class.

Bikram Yoga isn't for me. But regular Yoga most certainly is! I can't wait to find a room temperature class to take part in. I even got two of my friends to come along. It should be fun. I will keep you posted.

I don't know why I deleted my old blog! Why did I do that? I didn't feel like writing it one day and then POOF - delete. I'm too quick with the keyboard. This time around, I am going to write when I feel like I have something to say.

No committment. No pressure. Just whenever I have something important to get off my chest...
Associates on Partner Track Need a Plan B
Big law firms are naming fewer associates to the partner track, according to a Business Week article titled Making Partner Less Likely as Big Law Firms Face Cash Crunch.

The article reports:
Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP in New York announced it was promoting only six attorneys to equity partner in December, down from 20 a year earlier. Mayer Brown LLP in Chicago said it promoted 14 attorneys to partner in November, down from 27, and Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP in San Francisco announced seven partner promotions this month, down from 15 a year ago. Revenue at U.S. firms was forecast to drop as much as 10 percent in 2009, according to a survey of 131 firms by Citi Private Bank’s law firm group.
Here are some likely implications:
Associates will give more thought to hanging out their own shingle after gaining a few years of experience plus the money to offset law school loans
Business development skills will play a crucial role in new partner selection
Mid-sized firms will benefit from high level associates seeking better working conditions
Aggressive associates may move to in-house counsel positions more readily
Longer term, economic and competitive pressures will continue to push costs down while forcing law firms to increase proficiency in both operations and legal business development.

The Florida Bar Requires New Website Disclaimer Page
Attorneys licensed and/or promoting their services in Florida may provide information about the lawyer/firm’s past results and testimonials on their website ONLY IF they comply with new attorney advertising guidelines scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2010. 

A new "disclaimer" page must be added to sites that want to provide this information. Click here for sample disclaimer language for Florida law firm websites. 

We'll be writing more about these changes in future posts.
I wish I had taken a more proactive approach to my son's eating habits. Being the first-time new mom I did not know what the right quantity of food that should be given to an infant nor did I know how and when to feed the infant. Now after a year and 5 months I realize a few things which I wish I had known earlier. These would have helped my son be a better eater and me a more satisfied mom. 1. Never force feed your baby even when they are tiny babies. That habit must start from the cradle. 2. Kids know when they are hungry. So force feeding will kill their basic instinct. (It is very difficult to get back that instinct). And they will start developing hatred towards food. 3. If you start force feeding during the baby days, you will probably end up like me - always running behind your child during meal times. I dread meal times! Phew! It breaks my back. 4. Kids are not machines or "gunny bags" to eat some standard quantity of food at regular intervals. They will have their own pattern. We could possibly produce food in front of them every three hours or so and let them eat sitting in one place. This pathetic habit of showing some entertainment while eating - SUCKS! Don't even try it. 5. This really limits my ability to travel with my son and generally doing other things because a ) it is hell time consuming b)I don’t think I have the energy left to do anything else after a war with my son. Phew! I wish some day my son and I would break this lousy habit of running around and chasing each other while eating and I wish we would have happier and peaceful mealtimes. God help me!
I don't know how they thought they could get away with this, said Jibby McBib, a disappointed Aussie customer. "Just because it's on the back of the bottle doesn't mean people won't find out it's there." McBib said she would no longer buy Aussie products, but was unsure of which haircare products she could now trust. "You never read about this kind of thing in the media," she said. "It's always all about how it makes your hair look, what it smells like, and that kind of thing. To imagine this kind of thing has been going on all the time behind our backs...well, it makes me sick." Forensic literary science expert Bilbo McCrum believes the problem runs deeper than simple improper comma use. "Here is a company that promotes itself as being Australian, yet clearly refers to the country of Australia as a place from which macadamia nuts have to be 'brought back' for 'the rest of us'," he said. "This, combined with the failure to name the explorer who brought back the nuts, or indeed to specify where the nuts were brought back to, very much points to the presence of an unreliable narrator," McCrum continued.
I was planning on a Tibetan lesson last night, but when it got cancelled, I was left with “nothing” to do. “Nothing”, for me, apparently translates into:

Going for a run, getting rained on
Coming home, taking a shower
Emailing a bunch of people about upcoming shoots
Going to a cafe, eating a red velvet cupcake, and studying Tibetan for an hour or so
Walking home, stopping by the store on the way
Doing two blog posts about my yak leather bag(s) and an upcoming trip to Tibet
Receiving email back from people for the upcoming shoots–hurray, got the models I wanted!
Going to see my friend Will and his band Pure Ecstasy at a bar down the way, with camera in tow
Downloading shots, making selects, and exporting JPGs
Finally crashing into bed
And let’s note, that all took place between about 6pm and 1am. Solid evening! Here are a couple favorites from Pure Ecstasy at the Broadway Grill.
Stage lighting is so tricky. It looks awesome in person but is killer-hard to get right on camera. I think the trick is that you just have to completely GO WITH IT. So far as I know, there’s no good tool to “fight” it–and by that I mean normalize it somehow–other than going black and white. This is the kind of thing I can only seem to learn when I’m just messing around–like last night. By the way, I didn’t do any color correction on any of these photos–just tweaked the curves a little and added some noise reduction, along with a bunch of cropping.

Note also that I scared the crap out of the band when I snuck up behind them (whoops). Sometimes I think being a musician is a big advantage in shooting musicians–it does help me anticipate when things are going to happen–but then sometimes I think being a woman overshadows that completely.
My Lentil Weekend
I wrote over on Lynn’s Weigh yesterday on Facebook (come join us over there!) that when I get a hankering for a particular food, I eat it to death over the course of a few weeks then forget about it for awhile. This weekend lentils sounded really good, so I dug out my favorite lentil soup recipe and tried a new lentil “burger” recipe. Thought I’d share them both with you. 

I can’t remember where I got this soup recipe, so I apologize to whomever I lifted this from. I modified it a bit, but it’s not originally my recipe. 

Lentil Vegetable Soup
Makes 6 2-cup servings

1 large onion, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 t ground cumin
2 t chili powder
3 C veggie broth
1 C dried lentils (I sometimes use ½ C of lentils to make it more soupy)
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained (fire-roasted is fabulous!)
1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce
1 can (4.5 oz) chopped green chilies, undrained
1 C frozen corn
2 medium carrots, chopped (about 2 cups)
2 small zucchini, diced (about 2 cups)

Spray a 3-quart saucepan with cooking spray and sauté onion, garlic, spices in a little veggie broth until veggies are soft. Add everything else, cover and simmer for 35-45 minutes, depending on how soft you like your lentils. 

I modified a lentil meatball recipe that I found through Loser For Life Marisa’s blog. She originally got from In Jennie’s Kitchen. I made 8 patties rather than 18 meatballs and I’m using them like veggie burgers. 

The original recipe is below with my modifications in parenthesis. 

Lentil Ricotta Meatballs
Makes about 18

2 cups cooked lentils, pureed (I cooked them in vegetable broth rather than plain water)
2 large eggs, lightly beaten (1/2 C Egg Beaters)
2/3 cup plain breadcrumbs (I ground 2/3 C regular oatmeal)
1/2 cup fresh ricotta (I used low-fat ricotta)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoon chopped parsley
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Jennie’s cooking instructions: Add all ingredients to a deep bowl. Mix very well, using hands or a wooden spoon. Cover and refrigerate for two hours or overnight.

When ready to cook, shape mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls. Heat about 1/2-inch of oil in a nonstick skillet over medium flame. Add shaped “meatballs” and cook until browned all around, turning only once. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let excess drain off. Add to simmering marinara sauce if serving immediately, or store in a tightly covered container up to three days.

Lynn’s burger instructions: Preheat oven to 375. Lightly spray a baking sheet. Add all ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties (they will seem runny, but they’ll hold together, I promise) and place on baking sheet. Bake 20-30 minutes and flip them. Bake an additional 15-20 minutes or until they are brown. 

Note: I didn’t cover and refrigerate for two hours, but I might try that next time if I’m not pressed for time. They turned out very nicely anyway. I’m having a leftover burger for lunch today so I’ll see how well they do in the fridge. I also put three in the freezer to see how they fare that way, too. 

I’ll probably make them as meatballs at some point, too, and mix them with my homemade sauce and Shiratake noodles. 

Forgive the short blog. The first Sunday of daylight savings is always a catch-up day. Why is losing an hour like losing a whole day? LOL
You may be familiar with Moore's Law, which dictates that the computing power of a single silicon chip doubles roughly every two years, as the transistors upon it get tinkier and tinier. You may not be so familiar - mainly because I just made it up - with Garnier's Law. Garnier's Law dictates that the names given to mascara products will double in ridiculousness roughly every two years, despite the lack of any corresponding technical advance in the product itself. Like Moore's Law, Garnier's Law has been in force for some years, such that we now find ourselves in a world where the names given to mascara have become entirely decoupled from reality. Hence Lash Builder, a plausible name for a mascara, given that the sole function of the product is and always has been to cake your eyelashes in a manner that makes them look slightly thicker and longer, gave way in due course to Lash Architect, a ridiculous proposition when you think about it,
Tattoo Wednesday!
Posted by Sarah | Posted in Go Vegan | Posted on 03-03-2010

Yay! I got a new tattoo today!!
Gerry and the rest of the gang at Tattoo Zoo have been participating in the Two Dollar Tattoo Project and I wanted to get in on the action! :)
The other day Bryan did a sick R2D2 on our friend Ryan (Hi Ryan) and Gerry did a tiny ship in a bottle on Nova (Hi Nova) and Colin did the scene from the Empire Strikes Back with the AT-AT walkers on Bryan (Hi Bryan). Oh man it’s so sick! I’ll post the link to the photos once they’re up on the blog.
In a nutshell they have to do a tiny tattoo no bigger then a toonie (about the size of a silver dollar) and you can only tattoo with a single needle. For those of you tattoo virgins – single needle tattoo’s are technically very demanding and are an “old timey” way of tattooing that isn’t used very often anymore.
Gerry sent me a text this morning of the drawing he did for me with the line “Will you be my Mommy” under it. Ha! Look at how cute the drawing is!! How could I say no?

I realized as Gerry was tattooing me that it’s been a YEAR since my last tattoo (how did that happen?). A YEAR? Really?

My last tattoo was the matching “13th wedding anniversary” tattoos Gerry and I gave each other on our anniversary. Wow. A year? I’m still kind of dumbfounded. Time flies. :)
Here’s my puffer fish as just an outline alongside Gerry (for reference so you understand how small it is).

Here he is … all coloured and cute as pie!! I’ll take a better photo once he’s healed … I think I’ll name him Kaanapali! :)

Here is a photo we took as I am passing the $2 to Gerry as proof of compliance with the set parameters of the Two Dollar tattoo project.  :) 
It was a fun day. I wish all my tattoos were that easy!
Storm of the century

I know that the "big" storm is old news, but we have been in California for two weeks visiting Jared's family (another post about that to come) and I haven't gotten a chance to tell our story. Thank goodness for all the modern technology that alerts us to the weather with enough warning to prepare. Wednesday night we made a trip to Sam's club to stock up on gas and food. It wasn't crazy crowded because this was two days before the storm is supposed to hit. My kids had been sick for about a week and Thursday night Ben was up complaining that his ear hurt. Friday morning we decide to take them to the Doctor before the storm. Snowflakes started to fall as we pulled into the parking lot. It was crowded, but they saw us and both my kids had ear infections. The doctor advised us to keep them inside for a few days. Then we had to get their prescriptions filled. Every pharmacy within a 10 mile radius had a 1-2 hour wait on prescriptions, people were panicking. We came home and Jared went out a little later to get their presciptions, are we seeing a pattern? He made it home safely. Everyone (but my youngest brother) was home and we just hunkered down for the storm. My sister and I had stocked up on some new toys that we pulled out for the occasion. Friday, all was well. We felt like we were prepared. I got up early Saturday morning, for no apparent reason, and my sister was up too. She was worried about us losing power. Having no electricity might not seem so bad considering that my parents have propane heat, but keep in mind that we are on a well here. A well with an electric pump. No power also means no running water for us. She had filled up the bathtub with water and I filled every camel back water bottle that we had (we have a lot of them between us all). Then we go back to bed. After I get up and eat breakfast, I start making bread. We didn't buy any bread because I was going to make some. Here are the pictures of the dough rising. 


I was preheating the oven to bake my bread when the power went out. It was only 10 am. According to my husband, I was freaking out. I was worried about my bread and the fate of us all without bread to eat. But I really didn't need to worry. Jared and my brother-in-law dug out the gas grill and the fire pit and cooked that bread!


I really was impressed. It snowed the entire time they were out there cooking the bread. The two loaves they cooked on the grill, and the three free form loaves they cooked in a dutch oven over a fire they built during a snow storm. The gas grill really saved us during the entire weekend. For lunch we had leftover lentil soup that they warmed up outside with fresh bread. For dinner we grilled up some venison, potatoes, and veggies. It did not feel like we were deprived of anything. But it sure gets dark early with no electricity. My brother-in-law popped popcorn on the gas grill, and we let the kids watch a show on our portable DVD player that has a 6 hour battery (which was fortunately fully charged). Jared had filled up lots of buckets of water and my sister had filled the tub, but with 12 people in the house you use a lot of water just flushing toilets. By Saturday night our bathroom water supply was almost depleted. We still had plenty of drinking water, thank goodness. My sister went outside and stuck all those empty buckets around the house to catch the water run-off, brilliant! Sunday morning, still no power. We used as many paper products as we could to avoid having too many dirty dishes laying around. Since it finally stopped snowing, the men went outside to assess the damage. Numerous trees had fallen, including three across our drive way. They spent most of Sunday cutting down the trees and shoveling a little bit. Once they got the driveway cleared they did some further exploring on our street. There are three ways to get to main roads from our house. Well, a power pole had fallen across the road one way, a tree branch had broken off, taking down some power lines with it the other direction, and the "secret back road" had a car stuck right in the middle of it. No power and no way out, we were totally cut off from the outside world. The phone stopped working on Sunday. Cell phones with no electricity to charge them were our only link to the outside world. I have a couple of siblings that live an hour away, and they didn't lose power. They offered to rescue us, but they couldn't get to us, we would have had to hike about a half mile in 30 inches of snow. My two kids have ear infections, my parents are in their 70's, not much hope of hiking out. Remember that the doctor had told us to keep our kids inside for a few days. That was a bit harder than I thought it was going to be. My brother grilled chicken and potatoes with some veggies for lunch. Sunday night before the kids went to bed we all hung out together in the living room, lighted by my dad's two oil lamps. My brother played guitar and we all sang while the kids danced around. It was a lot of fun and something that only happened because we had nothing else to do. Then we put the kids to bed. We were all a little disappointed that the power was not back on for the Superbowl, for which we had made sandwiches and had chips and dip. Then my brother-in-law and my dad rigged up a TV plugged into my mom's Prius. And it worked! We got to watch the Superbowl, I couldn't believe it. But then it was back to darkness. Monday morning the kids were getting a little stir crazy. My sister dug some toys out of storage that the kids haven't seen in two years. That helped buy us some time. After lunch the road was cleared one way, we could leave! Still no power mind you, but a way out. My sister called some friends in the ward that live in an apartment complex and she asked if we could all come over and shower at the club house. All 12 of us climbed into my sister's 4 wheel drive car that seats eight. We dropped my brother and his son off and we headed off to shower. We filled up all of our water bottles too. Keep in mind that another storm was coming with another predicted 10-20 inches. We went to a grocery store to get us through another storm. Then we went to the mall. It was almost surreal. We had felt so cut off for nearly three days and people were shopping at the mall like it was an ordinary day. I really felt like we had just come out of the dark ages. Which in a sense we had, I guess. Then we made it home, but we had to hike up the long and steep driveway with all our groceries. When we got home, the power was back on. I was so happy, I could go to the bathroom without a flashlight. My parents have a very unique house and all the bathrooms are in the center of the house without any windows. In other words, very dark even in the middle of the day. We hit the house with a vengeance, we did 3 loads of dishes that night alone and 4 loads of laundry. Can I just say that Jared is a survivor, I really don't need to worry with him around. My brother-in-law is the same way. They really saved the day. The story doesn't end there. With another storm looming in the horizon, everyone's plans changed. Two of my siblings (that live an hour away) decided to head to Florida. Their school district had already cancelled school for the whole week. One of them need my brother-in-law to house sit, so he was leaving. We were leaving for California on Wednesday. My dad said that if all his shovelers were leaving he had better go too! Tuesday morning they headed to the airport to see if they could get on a flight to Florida. At 9:40 am my mom calls from the airport. "Honey, the airport is closing after one today, do you want to try and get out to CA today?" Yes, I think I would. She handed her cell phone over to the Southwest agent. He was super friendly. His name was Eric and this is what he said to me "I can get you and your family on a flight leaving here at 11:40 am, can you make it here by then?" I paused for just a minute before I responded. I still had laundry, important laundry, drying. "Yes, we will be there." Then my mom talked to my sister "he says you and the kids can fly standby to Florida, to you want to come, the flight leaves at 10:50 am?" She said "yes" too. The whirlwind began. Bags packing, kids getting dressed, everyone hiking down the drive way. We booked it to the airport, as fast as you can book it in that much snow. My brother-in-law did a great job of driving us safely there. We literally ran through the airport with bags and kids in tow. I am not much for spur of the moment traveling, but it was an adrenaline high. Because the airport was closing in two hours, there weren't many lines, and they all let us go to the front of them. Very nice! We are helping my sister make it to her gate, my parents already on the plane. My sister is carrying one bag, Jared is carrying a bag and a kid. I am trying to herd the rest of them to the gate as fast as 4 and 5 year olds can run. She makes it to the gate and there is no one there. My parents are on the plane, sitting on the front row, saving her seats. The flight attendant prepares to close the door, my mom says "my daughter is coming!" The flight attendant tries to tell her that she didn't make it. My sister flagged an attendant and they tell her to just run onto the plane. I guess once they close the doors, they don't open them again. She made it! Then we had a few minutes before our flight took off. We barely had enough time to buy some lunch before we had to board the plane. But the kids were real troopers and we made it. They were so well behaved. It was awesome, traveling with kids does get easier. It took me awhile to come down off that high, but it was kind of fun. My brother was pretty surprised when he came home tuesday night to an empty house full of food. He had to hike the 1/2 mile because his ride couldn't make it down the road. That is our amazing story of survival. I hope you all were well during the storm of the century!

MDAC
My older brothers, who are nine and ten years older then me, often babysat for me and my siblings. They invented many "interesting" games to keep us busy until my parents came home. The most popular one was called mattress diving association championship or MDAC for short. It involved a mini trampoline, numerous mattresses stacked on top of each other, music, and diving on the mattresses. We would run, jump on the trampoline, and dive on to the mattresses. It was fun. You would have to really know my brothers to understand how they could make that game so much fun. We all had nicknames, our signature jumps, and turns holding the title of MDAC. My brothers would also videotape the proceedings so that we could watch it afterward. The proceedings included interviews, statistics, jumps, and sometimes award ceremonies. Well, this past Saturday it was snowing again, all day long. Jared and I picked the wettest year to move back east. Imagine five children, eight adults inside all day long. So after dinner I decided it was time for MDAC the next generation. I figured it would let the kids burn off some energy. It worked. The kids loved it, but it wasn't quite the same without my brother commentating the whole thing. CJ cried when we cleaned up the mattresses, it was hit. My sister even did a few dives! Enjoy the video, although you would probably enjoy seeing the original footage of MDAC. Fortunately I don't own any of these videos and it is unlikely that any of my brothers would post it.
DEDICATED TO MY BEST FRIEND - Take my hand and follow me
to that place I long to be.
Take my hand and trust my way,
in that place forever stay.

Follow me toward the sand;
we'll run and play, hand in hand.
Take my heart and hold it true;
forever I'll stay close to you.

Seize my words and listen well,
then forever I will tell.
Release your heart and feelings too,
just as I will do for you.
Trust your heart and follow me,
to that place we long to be.

The roads might be a little hazy
but for a moment, they'll be cleared
and perhaps you'll find your way
through the beauty of the expedition
that's raveling within your heart.

Love is never promised,
but it's worth all the risk
for the reward is a pair of wings
with hope of flight
without all the littered debris.

Life is a quest full of roads,
long, short, up, and down,
but it is only you
who makes the decision
which way to go.

The roads may be long and winding,
but that won't stop me
from taking a journey to your heart
Television soaps have become a thing of the past with reality shows taking India by storm. Reality shows work on a nationwide level because they are interesting, they seem real, and the audience plays a big part in ‘who gets selected to go to the next level’. Also, millions of people’s dreams have come true with the advent of reality shows- they get to be on television and perfectly ordinary people become celebrities in the course of an episode or a ‘season’. Some shows have new people participating in every episode, and also the audience can easily relate to the participants. These money spinners can be in the form of quizzes, family shows, challenges, dance shows, singing competitions, etc. and these have a mass appeal unlike the soaps which have particular target audiences. Reality shows, besides whether they are really ‘real’ or fabricated, are enjoyable and generate huge profits. But when the participants of these shows in question, are children, there are a whole lot of things to be considered.
Well, as you might have picked up from my front page, I'm a late-20's missus living in the gorgeous Hawkesbury region of North-West Sydney with the lovely Mr.P, my hubby of just over a year. I've been living out here for about 6 years after growing up in the 'Macarthur Region'...which is a nice way of saying Campbelltown! I didn't technically live IN Campbelltown, I lived about 10 mins outside (the Sydney-side...smug much....lol!)...in the lovely suburb of St. Andrews. I grew up there with 3 sisters and a brother, the greatest siblings a gal could ask for (although my sibling-in-laws...2 sisters, 2 brothers...are pretty damn cool too!). I love lots of different things and always have some obsession going...be it knitting, scrapbooking, a tv show, painting, colouring-in (I LOVE colouring-in, most relaxing thing), blogging, tweeting, facebook-ing, Sims 3, Wii, a book series, I can't help myself. I tend to get really into something and let it go after a while, then pick it up again, but one thing I can't stop doing, is reading.
Whether you believe the economy is about to double dip, or fight on and surpass last year's sigh of relief, there is one thing for certain: consumer confidence appears to be on the rise and core industries are once again gaining momentum. 
Building activity is expected to reach new euphoric highs in most states this year, and the resources industry is back at the helm of the national soapbox. Once key national companies start making agressive decisions, peripheral supporting service industries (ie engineering; legal; architecture; project management etc) always see growth as a follow through. 
So, how do you capitalize on emerging opportunities and put yourself in the sweet spot for growth? 
TIP 1: Review the segments primed to move in your target markets and select the highest priority that is the most beneficial to your business. 
TIP 2: Evaluate the quality of your existing relationships in high growth sectors: Are they all you need to support your growth in these emerging high priority areas? Do you need to extend your customer-centric relationships? How many people do you know that influence customer decisions in your new priority sectors? 
TIP 3: Consider how your business profile and key personnel are positioned in these industries. Take a long, hard, critical look at that ways that you can reach out to your ideal target markets in dynamic ways that demonstrate your ability to deliver over and above the market standards. Ensure your business has the tools for communicating in the new economy and your staff have the skills and confidence to lead you out into the market. If they dont, create and implement rigorous train programs. 
TIP 4: Scan and monitor the competition. Are you demonstrating your points of difference and USP effectively? Are you drawing contrast with your competition or trying to look the same?
I had a conversation with Wilder and Gwyn tonight that was just too precious to risk forgetting. It was the most intense and lengthy conversation we've had yet about our new baby coming. I asked Wilder where our new baby was going to sleep when she got here. Of course he said his bed so he could love her. This then opened up a huge discussion of what we're going to do with the new baby when she gets here. We went through everything from bathing, feeding, to showing her all of his new toys. Gwyn chimed in now and then, I think she really understood. At one point they were both showing me how babies crawl so that they could teach her to crawl. The sweetest was when Wilder said we have to snuggle her on the couch and give her lots of hugs. I think I'm just dumbfounded at how smart Wilder is becoming lately. He understands so much now. His curiosity and sincerety never fail to make my heart be still just for a moment. I know he is going to be an incredible, loving, protective big brother who will love taking care of both of his little sisters.
Former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden was fond of saying that when it came to handling high value terror suspects, he would play in fair territory, but with "chalk dust on my cleats." Four legal memos released last week by the Obama Administration make it clear that the referee role in CIA interrogations was played by its medical and psychological personnel.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, which authored the memos, legal approval to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and other abusive techniques pivoted on the existence of a "system of medical and psychological monitoring" of interrogations. Medical and psychological personnel were the arbiters of torture, assigned to monitor interrogations and intervene to ensure that interrogators didn't cause "serious or permanent harm" and thus violate the U.S. Federal statute against torture.

The reasoning sounds almost circular. As one memo, from May 2005, put it: "The close monitoring of each detainee for any signs that he is at risk of experiencing severe physical pain reinforces the conclusion that the combined use of interrogation techniques is not intended to inflict such pain."

In other words, as long as medically trained personnel were present and approved of the techniques being used, it was not torture.

The memos provide official confirmation of both much-reported and previously unknown roles of doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and other medical personnel with the CIA's Office of Medical Services. The government's lawyers characterized these medical roles as "safeguards" for detainees.

Medical oversight was present from the beginning of the special interrogation program following the 9/11 attacks, and appears to have grown more formalized over the program's existence. The earliest of the four memos, from August 2002, states that a medical expert with experience in the military's Survival Evasion Resistance, Escape ("SERE") training would be present during waterboarding of detainee Abu Zubaydah, and would put a stop to procedures "if deemed medically necessary to prevent severe medical or physical harm to Zubaydah." (All interrogation techniques, the memos said, were "imported" from SERE.)

Later, the CIA's Office of Medical Services (OMS) personnel were involved in "designing safeguards for, and in monitoring implementation of, the procedures" used on other high value detainees. In December 2004, the OMS produced a set of "Guidelines on Medical and Psychological Support to Detainee Rendition, Interrogation and Detention," a still-secret document that is heavily quoted from in three legal memos that were written the following year.

The CIA declined our request to comment further on the OMS's role in detainee treatment. The OMS employs physicians, psychologists and other medical professionals to care for CIA employees and their families.

Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the memos is their intimation that medical professionals conducted a form of research on the detainees, clearly without their consent. "In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented," one memo reads. The documentation included not only how long the procedure lasted, how much water was used and how it was poured, but also "if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled....and how the subject looked between each treatment." Special instructions were also issued with regard to documenting experience with sleep deprivation, and "regular reporting on medical and psychological experiences with the use of these techniques on detainees" was required.

The Nuremberg Code, adopted after the horrors of "medical research" during the Nazi Holocaust, requires, among other things, the consent of subjects and their ability to call a halt to their participation.

The memos also draw heavily on the advice of psychologists that interrogation techniques would not be expected to cause lasting harm. At times this advice sounds contradictory. While calling waterboarding "medically acceptable," the OMS also deemed it "the most traumatic of the enhanced interrogation techniques."

The fact that traumatic events have the potential to cause long-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome has been well documented. Physicians for Human Rights, in interviews with eleven former detainees held in Iraq and Afghanistan, found "severe, long-term physical and psychological consequences." "All the individuals we evaluated were ultimately released without ever being charged," said Dr. Allen Keller, medical director of the Bellevue/New York University School of Medicine Program for Survivors of Torture.

The memos describe the techniques in highly precise and clinical detail, befitting a medical textbook. During water boarding, in which a physician and psychologist were to be present at all times, "the detainee is monitored to ensure that he does not develop respiratory distress. If the detainee is not breathing freely after the cloth is removed from his face, he is immediately moved to a vertical position in order to clear the water from his mouth, nose and nasopharynx." Side effects including vomiting, aspiration and throat spasm that could cut off breathing were each addressed: "In the event of such spasms...if necessary, the intervening physician would perform a tracheotomy."

While physician assistants could be present when most "enhanced" techniques were applied, "use of the waterboard requires the presence of a physician," one memo said, quoting the OMS Guidelines.

Doctors were also described as having vetted the practices for safety. Certain limits on waterboarding were created "with extensive input from OMS." One memo states that OMS "doctors and psychologists" confirmed that combining the various techniques "would not operate in a different manner from the way they do individually, so as to cause severe pain."

Medical and psychological personnel were required to observe whenever interrogators came into physical contact with detainees, including slapping them and pushing them into flexible walls ("walling"). Whenever a detainee was doused with cold water, a medical officer had to be on hand to monitor for signs of hypothermia. Confining prisoners to cramped boxes required "continuing consultation between the interrogators and OMS officers." Prisoners made to stand for long periods to prevent sleep were to carefully monitor detainees for swelling of the legs and other dangerous conditions, and at least three times early in the program were switched, on medical advice, to "horizontal sleep deprivation."

This was one example of how medical personnel could, according to the CIA, help prevent "severe physical or mental pain or suffering" on the part of the detainees. However the memos show that the OMS's role was not merely to limit the medical impact of interrogations, but also to consult on the effectiveness of interrogations. A May 30, 2005 memo quotes the OMS suggesting that cramped confinement was "not...particularly effective" because it provides "a safe haven offering respite from interrogation."

Monitoring interrogations is a role that the American Medical Association, among others, has rejected, pointing out that the presence of physicians or other medical personnel could paradoxically make interrogations more dangerous. As Keller explains it: "The interrogator may think well, the health professional will stop me if I go too far. The health professional is thinking I'm really here at the behest of the CIA. There's a tension of dual loyalty."

Just as officials in the Justice Dept. now condemn waterboarding as torture, so, too, did opinion change at another organization, the American Psychological Association. In the frightening days following the 9/11 attacks, "there were two schools of thoughts in the psychological community. One was if you were there on the ground you could do some good," said APA spokesperson Rhea Farberman, whose organization was criticized for originally taking that position. The group's current stance is to forbid psychologists from participating, she said. "If you are there on the ground, you may be seen as condoning the behavior."

Some medical professionals are calling for colleagues to be investigated and sanctioned. But finding out which professionals were involved in designing, monitoring and implementing the interrogation techniques may be difficult. The four memos were released almost in their entirety. The few redactions concerned mainly the names of the personnel involved.
Tomorrow, the Special Envoy for Malaria at the United Nations will be announcing a special Social Media Envoy group that will use the power of social media over the next year to raise awareness for malaria control in African countries.

The special envoy is made up of well-known figures from both the social web and broadcast media, including Mashable’s own Pete Cashmore. Those that have joined the group have pledged to take one “social” action — such as a tweet or a Facebook (Facebook) post — every month for the next year starting from World Malaria Day on April 25, which last year saw Malaria No More also use Twitter for the cause.

The hope is that the tweets, posts and other social actions will inspire and motivate social media audiences in support of malaria control. The UN’s goal is to provide all endemic African countries with malaria control interventions by the end of 2010, working towards the aim of near-zero deaths from malaria by 2015.

We’re very happy to see the UN enlist the power of social media in the fight against Malaria. The disease kills one million people each year with over 90% of the world’s malaria deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. Universal bed net coverage is the UN’s chosen prevention tool to fight the diseases; it has delivered over 192 million insecticidal mosquito nets since 2007, covering nearly 400 million people.

However, there is more money to be raised and more work to be done. We hope that the social media envoy will go even farther than their commitment to one social action per month, because Malaria is a battle where every little bit helps.
We recently reported child-actor Corey Haim had obtained a large quantity of prescription drugs just prior to his death earlier this week.Despite early reports suggesting Haim died of an enlarged heart, the coroner's office has stated the final cause of death won't be available for another six weeks when toxicology reports are completed. They have also begun investigating how Haim was able to get access to such powerful medications, including Oxycontin, Vicodin and Valium.According to the NYT, one of the prescriptions used to obtain these drugs was a forgery and investigators are looking into a larger issue with drug rings stealing legitimate script pads from doctors and forging prescriptions which are then sold illegally. But it goes even further than that. Here's what California Attorney General Jerry Brown had to say:
 “They get prescription drug pads, get illegal drugs, then sell them on the street. You have doctors doing wrong, people pretending to be doctors, and all the criminal intermediaries making the process work.”Initial police reports into Haim's death stated no illegal or illicit drugs were found in his possession however, as we've learned with high profile cases like Heath Ledger, Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, and Brittany Murphy, prescription drugs used improperly can have just as deadly consequences.Haim's agent, who also represents his long-time friend Corey Feldman, Mark Heaslip said Corey was making great strides to wean himself off of drugs, which may have been as many as 50 pills a day.  He also said the actor had just begun work with an addiction specialist. In the days leading up to Corey's death he had complained of having trouble breathing and had a fever between 99 and 101. His mother had thought he was fighting off a cold or flu, but as it turns out these may have been symptoms of his enlargdheart.
I just love spending the day at the temple. I have to admit I hate the thought of giving up a whole day to go, but it is so worth it once I get there. There were about 12 members of our ward together and we had family names from 2 members. We did initiatory work and an endowment session, so it was a real blessing. I didn't have to drive, was in good company all day and made a quick visit to the bookstore also. I am hoping to someday live closer to a temple, but for now, I will try to remember the wonderful feelings I felt today and continue to attend at least once a month with the ward. For those who live close to a temple, I hope you appreciate it. On the down side, I had planned to call Lindsey while in Mesa and she was going to meet us at the temple so I could meet Mayan. When I first got down to the church this morning, I called Ray to let him know I would not be driving and the car would be in the parking lot. I then, hurriedly, gathered my belongings and jumped in another car. It wasn't til I got to thetemple that I realized my phone was not with me (apparently never made it back in the purse, but on the floor of my car) . But I will go visit the Morris family sometime next week when Di is in Phoenix visiting her kids/grandkids, she and I will go see Lindsey. So, now that I am refreshed and uplifted, I look forward to the week to come. Ray and I just completed the family history/temple class in Sunday School and have begun the family search for his family. I am looking forward to seeing what information we can gather and begin the important work to be done for his ancestors. It is such a blessing.
Last week Frank Minyard, the Orleans Parish coroner, concluded that he could not determine what caused the death of Jannie Burgess, a 79-year-old patient who perished at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans after a doctor's orders led her to be given multiple doses of morphine in a short period. The hospital was cut off for several days by the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina and a number of patients were found dead with elevated levels of morphine and other drugs.

"We cannot tell what she died of except that she was extremely ill," Minyard said in a phone interview several hours before a scheduled press conference on Thursday. "She had a lot of physiologic reasons to die." Minyard said his official finding was that the cause of Burgess' death was "unclassified." His ruling makes it highly unlikely that any charges will be brought in the case.

The details of Burgess' death were first disclosed in a report published by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine last August. Her medical records showed that she was repeatedly dosed with morphine after the hospital had lost power, temperatures soared, and rescue helicopters failed to arrive in sufficient numbers.

The physician who ordered the medication, Dr. Ewing Cook, said that he intentionally "hastened her demise" because Burgess, who had advanced, metastatic uterine cancer, was close to death, was being cared for by nurses whose help was needed elsewhere, and would have suffered greatly if her pain medication wore off during any attempt to evacuate her.

"Dr. Cook thinks that he knocked her off," Minyard said, "but we can't prove that. He might have, he might not have. Because it's not 100 percent proved, we have to call it unclassified." He said some of the experts he consulted pointed to the fact that Burgess' death was recorded as having occurred more than three hours after the last of the morphine injections.

Cook's attorney, Ralph Capitelli, called Minyard's decision "the correct decision." Minyard said that he had not spoken with Cook. He said that during his investigation he consulted with four pathologists who work in his office, three local experts and Dr. Michael Baden, a renowned forensic pathologist from New York.

Baden has said he has a different view of the case. In an interview several months ago, after he reviewed Burgess' records, Baden said that Burgess' death was "no question a homicide." Homicide is defined by coroners as a death caused by the action of another person. Such findings do not address the issue of intent which is critical to deciding whether a crime has been committed.

Burgess' daughter, Linette Burgess Guidi, said she had not seen the experts' determinations. She said she hoped that some sort of review board could review Cook's actions. "I understand he was under a lot of pressure," she said. "I'm not out for vengeance. I just want to know the truth, I want to know what happened." She added, "There's too many questions."

The district attorney in Orleans Parish, Leon Cannizzaro, released a statement after Minyard's announcement. "Since it is the Coroner's opinion that this victim did not die as a result of being administered a lethal dose of narcotics, I cannot pursue a homicide charge at this time." Minyard conducted his assessment of the Burgess case at Cannizzaro's request. In September 2009, shortly after the ProPublica and New York Times Magazine report, Cannizzaro said he asked Minyard "to classify the deaths reported in" the article.

In 2006, authorities arrested Dr. Anna Pou and nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry for alleged mercy killings at the same hospital after Katrina. A local grand jury heard evidence in the case and declined to bring charges. The nurses and Dr. Pou emphatically denied that they had murdered patients and the case prompted outrage in New Orleans where medical professionals who worked in horrific conditions after the storm were widely viewed as heroes and victims. Some close to Minyard speculated that the coroner, who recently won re-election to his 10th term, decided to postpone his determination in the case until after the election -- something Minyard denies.

Minyard, 80, said the reason he had not completed his investigation of Burgess' death before now was because his office has a great deal of work on other cases and is understaffed. "I've just got too much going," he said when contacted last December. "I just want to make sure when I do it that I have it right."
Venezuela, already under watch from the likes of Reporters Sans Frontieres for jeopardizing press freedom, appears to be edging closer towards the type of restrictive governmental Internet interference as seen in Cuba, China and Iran.

Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president, has called for greater regulation of the Internet this weekend, with the following statement, as reported by Reuters:

    “The Internet cannot be something open where anything is said and done. Every country has to apply its own rules and norms.”

Chavez is said to have singled out one website as an example where such an “open” policy has troubled him. Noticierodigital had a post up for two days suggesting that Diosdado Cabello, a senior minister and close aide of Chavez, had been assassinated.

“We have to act. We are going to ask the attorney general for help, because this is a crime. I have information that this page periodically publishes stories calling for a coup d’etat. That cannot be permitted,” Chavez said.

Twitter (Twitter) and Facebook (Facebook) are also said to have come under criticism from Chavez, with the president reported to have complained “that people use such sites to spread unfounded rumors.” Recently, he called Twitter messages a “tool of terror.”

Chavez has already moved to control TV and radio networks in the country – in August last year 34 broadcasters were closed down on “administrative grounds” while Chavez’s own lengthy presidential broadcasts are now aired compulsorily across both terrestrial and cable TV stations.

Chavez expressing such negative interest in the online world will no doubt be met with great concern by those who oppose him, as well as in the wider world.

Chavez’s comments serves to remind all of us — regardless of nationality — about the importance of a free and open Internet. When it ceases to be such, it’s no longer the world wide web but a poor imitation propagated by repressive regimes.
I have the urge to blog, even after barely surviving NaBlo. Crazy!Anyone know knows me IRL knows I can really get rambling about television - because I love to ramble on about my favorite, and not-so-favorite shows. However, I don't usually like to write about it, because I prefer to engage someone else in a discussion. Not scribble out my thoughts, and wait to see if anyone replies, and then get wrapped up in that wacky back-and-forth internet conversation. I like to do it up front, face to face, nose to nose. Old school, as it were.But after a long and one-sided chat with Philsy today (who is exhausted after finishing scoring his first feature, holy poop on a plate!), I decided to turn loose a few thoughts for ya'll to chew on, add to, or spit out. So here it is:For the past few months, I've had an on-again-off-again romance (or been boink-buddies, if you prefer) with Glee.Okay. I get it. Glee is awesome, for a lot of obvious reasons. The pilot alone reminded me to not stop believing, and embarrassing as tis is, I like to dial this up full-blast whenever I'm having a "I'm a hack writer and I suck and I have no business doing this and I have the vocabulary of a pre-schooler" moment. The premise is fresh and unique - the cast is spectacular. The bones of the story arcs for the first season are clever and interesting.However... about 75% of the episodes after the pilot follow a formula like this: Someone gets mad/upset/threatened. They quit Glee. Everyone works to get them back, and they do. The end.or...Someone (or something) threatens to shut Glee down. Glee kids scramble to resolve the conflict. Conflict is resolved. The end.Now, I know that some pretty big stakes are being spun over the first season for individual character story arcs, so I can appreciate that they're working to weave a lot together. But really... does almost every episode have to focus on Glee club losing members or being shut down? Could we not build out more stories about the characters, to help the audience develop deeper relationships wih them and learn more about them, and forge episodes around that? They did manage to do it, for that remaining 25%. I'm confident they can continue to do it if they try - but right now I feel like I'm being fed a lot of filler and recycled drama.In fact, there was one storyline in particular this week that was like nails down a blackboard. Turn back now if you don't want *** SPOILERS ***!Glee club, unbeknownst to their director Will Schuester, participated in a professional television commercial for a mattress store - although they did not accept payment, they did receive a shipment of mattresses, an honorarium for their work. After discovering his wife Terri was not actually pregnant, a very upset Will returned to school late at night, found the pile of mattresses, pulled the plastic off one and slept on it.
What Will didn't realize, was that by accepting payment (even in pocket-coil form) he was thereby upping the status of Glee club from amateur to professional, thus disqualifying them from preforming in sectionals.This resulted in a screaming match between Will and Sue (the overly-aggressive cheerleading coach antagonist) in the principal's office, where it was concluded by the end of the scene that nothing had changed, and the kids would now be disqualified.Except that a short few scenes later, it was determined that the Glee kids could go on to perform at sectionals if they returned the unused mattresses, but that Will would not be permitted to coach them or participate further because he'd already had a good nights sleep on one of them and, well, you just can't return a used mattress.Huh.If we'd had that resolve back in the argument scene, then we could have pushed Will's character a little further. Because even though he cares about the Glee kids more than anything, deep down, he's really there because hents to recapture the greatest moments of his life - his youth - which were with Glee. His marriage is failing - the woman he truly loves is slipping away, and Glee's all he's got. So to see him struggle, and ultimately give up Glee in order to let them succeed would have been a nice little tid-bit of development.
Maybe I'm way off, I don't know. But that's what I'd have done.Next week's the finale. I'm excited to see what they'll do with it, but more importantly, I'm extremely curious to see where they're going to take the next season. Hopefully, it's a whole lot more of that 25%.
This is a small little story about an outlandish girl named Victoria and a cheerleader named Kimiko. Even though they are different, they love each other. Read on about this little exert from their lives.

Victoria stops her car at the top of the mountain on the ledge with the wooden fence at the end. She steps out of her old, beaten up, black Mustang and sits on the hood. Victoria stretches out her legs and lays back against the windshield.


Kimiko very gracefully steps out of the passenger seat and sits on the edge of the hood of the car. “There’s a party at Jimmy’s place later. Maybe we can stop by?”


“Why, Kimi? So all your Hollister addicted friends can ridicule me when we show up?”


“You know, they don’t really hate you like you think they do.”


“I don’t care.”


Kimiko sighs. “I know.” Victoria reaches into the pocket of her black skinny jeans and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. She takes one of the white sticks and rests it in her mouth. She lights the tip and breaths in. “I wish you wouldn’t smoke. I hate that habit.”


“What the hell are you saying? Aren’t you aware that basically all your friends at the party you want to go to smoke weed.”


“Oh,” she adjusts her bra strap through her long-sleeved, pink, Abercrombie shirt and runs her fingers through her long, golden hair, “I never thought of that.”


“Oh, what a surprise.” Kimiko looks down at the ground and kicks a rock. Victoria notices the change in mood. “I-I’m sorry, that was uncalled for.” She throws the cigarette on the dirt next to the car. “Come on, sit next to me,” Victoria pats the metal hood to the left of her.


Kimiko smiles and sits next to Victoria. “You like my skirt?” she straightens out her light blue mini-skirt.


“Surprisingly, yes. On anyone else, it would look horrible. You just make everything look good.” She straightens out her Johnny The Homicidal Maniac t-shirt.


“You look good, too.”


“You’re just saying that.” She scratches her head.


“I’m not. You don’t really like compliments, so I would only say it if I really meant it.”


“Heh. Thanks.” She puts her arm around Kimiko and they stare into the sky. “I love this spot. What about you, Kimi?”


“It’s good.”


“Good? Just good? This spots amazing, especially at night. Where the sky is bright with the stars and moon and we get to look down on the lights of the pathetic little city below.”


“I’ve never viewed it that way.”


“Yeah. No one’s seen it that way, especially your friends.”


“Why do you hate them so much?”


“They’ve treated me horrible since I’ve known them.”


“I apologize for them.”


“I wish that meant something.”


Kimiko leans over and kisses Victoria on the lips. “I love you.”


“I love you, too.”


“Why do you love me? You hate my friends, my cloths, the fact that I’m a cheerleader, and just basically everything I represent. So, why do you love me?”


“I don’t know. When I found out there was another lesbian in this town, I had to meet her. At first I really hated you just because of what you described. But, I kept talking to you and realized you were better than I thought and I really liked you. I’m really happy you aren’t like everyone else. On that note, why do you like me?”


“You’re really cute and you’re really nice. Like, you don’t look like you’d be nice. But, you’re amazingly sweet. It was really surprising. No offense.”


“Heh. None taken.” Victoria hugs Kimiko and holds her in her arms. “I really love you, Kimi.”


“I love you, too.”


A couple minutes of silence later, Victoria pats Kimiko on the back. “Come on, lets go.” She hops off the hood of the car.


“What?” She follows.


“It’s getting late. We should get going.”


“Where are we going? To your place?”


“Nah. You wanted to go to that party right? We’ll just go there. You’d be happy to see your friends.” She sits in the drivers seat.


“But, you’d be miserable.” She opens the car door and gets in.


“But, you’d be happy. And, that means more to me.” She turns the key and starts the car.


“I’d rather go to your house. I’d have more fun there.” She fastens her seatbelt.


“Alright. Let’s go there.”


They drive back
Thats how long it is untill we move.  We have been packing like crazy, and getting the kids prepared.  We have lots of people coming to help us on Saturday, so i think it will go smoothly.  hopefully fast too.   I cant believe its so soon, but yet, i cant wait for this week to be over. I dont want to be in this house anymore.  i am ready to move on.

I got the results of logans latest EEG, and it came back completely normal.  no seizure activity at all has shown up.  so now we have to figure out what is going on with him.  he is failing at school, and i dont know what more i can do.  we always do homework with him. he dosnt miss alot of school.  i just dont know

i got the boys school papers to help with the transfer process.  they are getting really excited about the move. they have been "helping" me pack.  they did well with their rooms. 

there is going to be alot of last minute stuff to do. Nick and i packed all day today, we got alot done, but there is alot more to go. and i work the next 3 nights, so not as much is going to get done.

i will update more after the move, right now my mind is just spinning and i cant think of everything i want to put here..lol
God is in the slums, in the cardboard boxes where the poor play house… God is in the silence of a mother who has infected her child with a virus that will end both their lives… God is in the cries heard under the rubble of war… God is in the debris of wasted opportunity and lives, and God is with us if we are with them. If you remove the yolk from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in darkness and your gloom will become like midday and the Lord will continually guide you and satisfy your desire in scorched places Bono
lright folks, it's time for us to have a heart to heart talk: I hate the beach. Ironic, then, that I'm currently sitting on Huntington Beach in southern California, eh? 
I know, I know, "That's absurd!" you say, "She's a total freak," you're thinking. But to each his own, I say, and my reasons for this hatred are four fold:
1. It's hot. I hate being hot. I hate it a whooooole lot. If I had a choice between going to the Bahamas or going to Alaska in the middle of winter, I would choose Alaska. If I had a choice between dying in the middle of the Mojave Desert and freezing to death in Siberia, I'd choose Siberia.
2. There is sand - EVERYWHERE. You go in the water, come out and sand gets stuck on everything. Not to mention that it gets lodged in orifices you didn't even know you had.
3. The water is salty. I prefer fresh water that I could drink if I was dying of thirst instead of having to stare at water that would kill me even faster. Also, salt water does not smell good - or taste good, for that matter. 
4. There are half naked people who should definitely not be half naked.
However, my current view from this floral beach chair looks something like this:
As the ministry of Partners for Care expands, God brings people to help us.  We plan to feature these people through our Partner Profiles. You will hear from them how they have a heart for those God calls them to serve. The first Partner Profile features Bridgette Boylan. I have known Bridgette only for a short time but it seems like she has always been a part of our ministry.  She is passionate and compassionate. She is energetic and enthusiastic. She has become a real partner to me personally and to the ministry... AND, she is raising funds to buy the team in Kenya a van. Those of you who have been in Kenya with us know we need a van to reach the people of Kenya with the messages of HIV/Aids prevention and salvation.  Some of you have even pushed the PFC van more than once to get it to start! Please see her profile below and help if you can. If you have a small group Bridgette would love to come and speak to them about how God interrupted her life when she went to Kenya.

Thanking God for Bridgette - our partner in reaching the lost and helping the hurting,

Connie
After more than 35 years, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, (pictured far left) and Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, (pictured far right) are senior senators. A lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.. (Photo Credit: Getty Images/File)

Washington (CNN) - While many in Washington believe that bipartisanship is long gone, two seasoned senators say it's not - at least not yet.

The relationship between Sen. Richard Lugar, a conservative Republican from Indiana, and Sen. Patrick Leahy, a liberal Democrat from Vermont, was born in obscurity - two very junior senators at the far reaches of a committee room table.

Leahy recalled a story from a time when their voices were virtually muted in a committee meeting.

"Neither one of us could hear what they [committee leaders] were muttering. And I said, 'Well, wait a minute, could I ask what was in that amendment?' You could see the two look down like 'Who the heck are these two guys at the end?' [He] takes his gavel and said, 'We're adjourned.' "

After more than 35 years, Leahy and Lugar are senior senators. A lot has changed - except for the friendship, which has proven stronger than their political differences.
Lately it’s been abnormal to see a smile on my face, life has been so crazy busy, hectic, stressful, dull, annoying and well pissy!
That when I do actually have a smile on my face people tend to wonder what I am actually up to. I hate to sound like a broken record and I’m most positive that I’m not the only one w/in this great big world of ours that is not having a great 2009. I’m truly hoping for a bright 2010.

But lately, life has been full of one big disappointment after another.

My kid’s fathers… huge disappointments in the Daddy arena. They just can’t seem to pull their heads outta their asses to step up and do what needs to be done to take care of their half of the responsibilities. My son’s father blames it all on me.. I left him, so therefore it’s all my responsibility. My daughters father… well… I don’t even know where to begin there, so let’s just suffice it to say that it’s most important for him to either impregnate as many women as possible or smoke up his entire life. 
Im telling ya, I sure do know how to pick them!

But lately… there has been very little to smile about. My kids make me smile. Even if they are teenagers, and are slowly driving me drink (kidding I don’t drink anymore than normal) I’ve been really sick… the plus side of being sick is that I’ve pretty much kicked the smoking habit. Although I’m not saying I’m a non-smoker. I’m just saying... I haven’t had one for a week now because I’ve been so sick and I do not even desire one. So that’s a plus.

I met someone who makes me smile. 
It’s all about the person’s personality.

I adore his personality.
He makes me laugh
He makes me smile
He makes me feel
He makes me happy

I don’t want to feel, be happy, laugh or smile

Because when it all goes away what are you left with?

Hurt/pain/anger

I can’t go there again
Well, where do I start.... We took Porter to the ENT dr for his followup appointment on Monday. He had been having a really snotty nose and cough, and had gone back to not sleeping well. We were worried that his tubes had come out or were stopped up. His tubes looked good (yea!), but Dr Norris was worried that he still had some ongoing infection in his adenoids. He gave him augmentin, nystatin, and ear drops. Augmentin is really bad on the GI tract, and Porter does not handle antibiotics well, so we were worried about how this would go. He started having diarrhea last night, and his poor little booty was so raw and painful that we skipped his dose last night. We decided he should probably stay home from daycare today so I could keep an eye on his bottom better and keep it "pasted" (caked with boudreaux's butt paste). Between me working nights and having a diarrhea day ahead, we had all the makings for a miserable day, but it was just the opposite. We had a great day!!! Porter and I went to our favorite park at 9:00am, stayed for over an hour, and were filthy when we left. We ran by Target to get a few things, and Porter fell asleep on the way home. I transferred him to our bed and took a nap with him. He slept for 3 hours!!! He ate cheetos and a hotdog for a late lunch and then I set him up in our bedroom and bathroom to play while I worked out. He danced to his video and played all over me while I worked out. We tried to take a quick walk after my workout, but it started raining on us and we had to run home. Porter didn't mind. He was just squinting and smiling in his stroller. Then we both got a shower in our bathroom. Porter loves taking a shower--I just hold him with his back to the water and he lays his head on my shoulder and let's the water run over him. He actually fell asleep in the shower one time. After we got out, Jared got home soon, and we picked up a pizza for supper before I left for work. I know I'll be tired later, but it was worth getting to spend a day with my little buddy. A potential bad day couldn't have been any better! Here are some pictures from the day.On the way to the park!
Have now received the instructions for a Round Robin Challenge that I have agreed to take part in.
The Round Robin starts today.
This month:-
1. you have to make a piece of fabric, a fat 1/4 in size.  You can stamp, dye, print etc.  You all have a theme to work to, and you can use architecture, culture, clothes etc as your design source.
2.  Your fabric must to be passed onto the next  person BY the 31st March, with your design source/image to show that person where your ideas are coming from.
Using the random number generator this is what you have got-
1)  Nickie-Europe
2) Margaret-Asia
3) Di-Australasia
4) Deb-Africa
5) Sharne-America's
I will email you all on March 22nd with info on who to pass your fabric onto.
Please post photo's on your blog of what you are doing with the challenge.
 
So now I seriously need to get my thinking hat on. It's been a while since I did any design work of any description and I felt that I should challenge myself again.
Also have the Chairmans challenge at Ferrers Quilters to think about. This is to make a miniature quilt any style any technique. A miniature is not something that I have attempted before so again a challenge for me.
Also have a stall at a Tattoo convention at the end of the month and need to produce some stock for that.
Phew!
On top of all this I have a new role at work and this is another new challenge.
I am still enjoying the belly dancing immensely and have (hopefully) booked tickets for an all day event which will include me doing 3 workshops. Very scary as I am a complete beginner.One of them is on American Tribal Style which is a form of belly dancing that I really like and may want to continue with.Although the event is in Andover the tutor for this ATS is local so it would not be too hard to get to classes.
So, for me, quite enough on my plate at the moment
Even though I don't have time to sit and write, I am gonna do it anyway. Maybe after the New Year, I'll get back to writing. I know I've said it before but I can feel words developing in my mind and an urge to sit and write is stirring a little.

It's been a difficult year. May be 2010 will be brighter. I know some major changes will be made and have already started... 

Granny is now in a nursing home that has a special Alzheimer's unit. The Friday after T-day, she got out of her house at 12:30 am and wasn't found until 8:30 am. Her core temp was 91 and she was in intensive care for a few days. Luckily she survived. It was cold but not below freezing all that night. The irony of it all was that she had ventured across the road over towards where some construction had been going on. She fell behind some heavy brush and couldn't get up. It's amazing she lived, especially since she was only wearing a thin nightie, no shoes or socks.

But luckily for us she is in good hands now and has no major damage done to her body due to the hyperthermia she sufferred. Mom was told that Granny has the vitals of a teenager. You know...God does take care of his own. Granny was a very religious lady all of her life and God won't forget that.

Sam's better and was working yesterday. I didn't have time to call and check on him. Nor have I had time to do anything fun with my chick friends. We may have dinner one night this week to share a drink and to laugh together one last time before the New Year.

My wish for all is to be happy and to embrace those around you whom you love. Life is so short and can change in a heartbeat.
Haai, so why is it that when we're left alone, we get paranoid; thinking up a storm of all the worst things that you can possibly come up with. I mean, why do you have to make sense of everything, why can't we just accept something for what it is. Why do we tend to analyze situations that have relatively made slight alterations in it's rather usual straight pattern. What's amazing is when things are back to normal, we so easily forget all the accusations and bogus imagery that went on up in there.

It's annoying that so many things were running through my mind in one particular episode. Thinking back, I feel pretty stupid for thinking and assuming such things.

I feel so, common.
Washed scary pile o' dishes. (Last week's cold resulted in a larger-than-normal pile, although I did get some done around Wednesday so that I'd have enough bowls and cutlery to make it through the week.)

Baked chocolate chip banana nut muffins, putting the rest of the nuts and buttermilk in the freezer before they spoiled. (Yay for not wasting food! I'm such a slacker...) I even started the muffins before the dishes, so everything except the muffin tins made it into the wash... and the muffin tins could have, but I was pooped with washing dishes by the time the muffins had cooled.

Baked bread to replace what had been in the freezer so long it was freezer-burned. (I *will* make hummus so that I can actually eat this batch.) The bread dishes (except for the bread pan) made it into the wash too.

Watered houseplants.

Cleaned silver spoons and silver necklaces, using the magic "aluminum foil, baking soda, and boiling water" method. It's an awesome method. I tried with hot tap water at first, but it didn't work nearly as well as the boiling water, even after leaving it sit while I had a shower.

Killed lots of flies, as mentioned previously. You know, reading about venus fly traps, over-feeding isn't a good thing. I suppose three-dozen flies at once probably would be too much? Until I find a place to buy a venus fly trap, it's a bit of a moot point, anyway. (And if I bought a sundew too, it would only be one and a half dozen each...)
Phase 1: Lagos

Step 1: Arrive at the airport. The power goes out while your luggage is still being brought out on the carrel. So you have to drag your two excessively overweight bags off the carrel while holding on to your precious laptop bag as well the carry-on bag you brought off the plane. Then you realize that the carts aren't free…..and you have no naira. So you drape the carry on and laptop bag on each shoulder then drag your two suitcases out of the airport. You get outside and realize that you also have no cell phone and that the nearest call place is "waaaaaay down that way"……



Step 2: You leave your aunt's house ready to go a-visiting. Then they tell you that the cabs are just a "little up the road". As you have sworn with all that is in you to never get on an okada, you decide to walk there. Conveniently, you forget that you're smack dab in the middle of the tropics during HARMATTAN season no less and that when you left it was snowing. You arrive sweating and exhausted at the car park then breathlessly tell the cab man the address. But it's not over, because the bloody bastard is trying to gouge out your eyes and cut off your right arm and left leg (get it??), so you gather your final strength and revive all your haggling skills. Finally, when you're both satisfied, you sink into the backseat and endure the hot, dusty ride.



Phase 2: Ibadan

Step 1: Your mom generously drops you off at your friend's house. She even lets you take the wheel. No biggie you think remembering all the weaving through traffic and switching lanes at 100 mph that you've come to enjoy. So you get on the road. It's an easy drive up your long street. You get on the main road, your mom's relaxed. Gabbing on the phone informing all and sundry that you are around and ready to be taxed so feel free to drop by. You get to a major junction. There's a policeman there directing traffic. You patiently wait your turn, and when he directs you and you move. Ah this isn't so bad you think. Then you get to another junction and you let the cars with the right of way pass you

"what are you doing?"

"huh?"

"my friend will you move?"

"but mummy it isn't my turn"

You hear the snort from the person she is currently gabbing with. By the time you get to your friend's house, all you want to do is curl up into a ball and rock back and forth.



Step 2: While at your friend's house, you decide to attend evening mass. You faintly recall that it was a short walk from their place. Plus it's evening so it's nice outside. You proceed to walk expecting any moment to see the steeple. You climb up a hill. Then you walk down another, artfully dodging okadas and wayward cars. Can't these people see that you're a pedestrian you fume. Finally, you get to church and say a small prayer of thanks that you convinced your friend to come get you after church. Mass takes way longer than it used to. Your friend has sent a text telling you he got tired of waiting outside so you should meet at the restaurant down the street. WHY ME you cry in your heart as you wearily trudge to the spot, planning how you'll chop off his head if he even suggests that you just walk home.


Step 3: Aaaah your friend's AC works. You sit back in the car and just enjoy the coolness of it while you reminisce about those bottles of real cold water you just downed. Then you feel a rumble. You look around in shock thinking o Lord are there earthquakes now in Nigeria? Then you realize its coming from your tummy. Your mind flashes back to the orgasmic moi-moi and ogi you had for breakfast. Your stomach rumbles again, and you wonder why your friend is suddenly driving so slowly. Good God man drive damn you! As you struggle to hold it all in, it comes back to you that you only ever used to eat moi-moi or any other beans products in the evening and only if there was tons of bread available. As you finally sink onto the toilet seat and settle down with your book for a long visit, you think how this is a much more effective and better tasting alternative to the horrid Chinese slimming tea you'd been on. Hmmm…
Sorry for the lack of posts. I've been doing more stuff on facebook these days then updating my blog (sorry)! So if you're on there, send me a friend request I'm on there as Aimee Olson and I'll add you (if I know you)... LOL

All is well at our house. We made it through the holiday's but started off the New Year a little rocky. We thought that the little Jetta that could had finally went to its final resting place. However, she was able to be resurrected. I'm pretty happy as I love driving her to work! So then, our GMC got wrecked suckin' crap! It doesn't have a lot of cosmetic damage but the young man that hit Kyle, hit the truck in a really bad spot so it goes into the shop this week so we'll wait and see what they have to say. I'll keep you all posted! Our work is just plugging along for both of us. I applied for a new job with the state but we're on a hiring freeze right now so we'll wait and see what happens. I'll be happy if a I get it but I'm also content where I'm at right now. It's a win win situation for me either way.

Ok... don't have a lot of time this morning so I'll share a few new pics. Hope all is well with everyone. Loves....
For some, sales is arguably the hardest job in the world. For others, however, the adrenalin of the roller coaster ride that is the sales process, keeps most on the edge of their seat for their entire careers. 
The real question are however, do businesses truly recognize and properly rate the critical importance of their sales people; and, do businesses ensure that their sales people are skilled and motivated enough to sell in a more than ordinary fashion? 
It's hard to find any businesses in the world who don't have something to sell and don't want to make money and succeed. It doesn't matter whether the company is selling services or products, if they don't have sales people who "feed" the business, the business won't exist. So, as most can imagine, motivating, training and energizing the salesforce should be as critical to a business as advertising and promotion. Without a strong sales force them, businesses can't close a sale and book revenue. 
With that said, here are some tips to help motivate and empower a collective salesforce. 
Give your team the power of positive feedback. 
Executives are fooling themselves if they think a sales force will work forever on financial motivation alone, but that's simply not true. Most sales people are a personality type that requires feedback. They emotionally connect with their customers, peers and networks, constantly seeking approval, satisfaction and achievement. 
The business owner or manager’s role is to support and reinforce the efforts of a motivated sales person. Without realizing it, a manager can drain the motivation right out of a team. A manager can strip away motivation them by creating a stressful, negative work environment. 

Guide and support them in building their own approach
Many people "fall" into sales as a career, finding themselves to be good at it early on. As they improve their techniques and confidence, they gradually work their way higher and higher up the food chain of a business until they reach the ceiling and seek entrepreneurial opportunity.
Sorry for taking so long to write properly but I literally haven't had a spare minute to do anything these last few weeks. Advance warning that this is likely to be a very long post so I can tell you everything thats been going on. I really miss it when I dont get time to blog and I find my mood starts to go down hill when I'm bottling things up that I can't get out of my system via a good old blog post,silly but true.

Right, so first news I suppose is that I am now writing for two blogs! Yes the woman who can't keep one blog up to date is now writing 2! The reason I'm doing this is because I have been made a patient ambassador for the transplant charity Live Life then Give Life. Along with my lovely friend Rachael Wakefield , we will be telling our stories, helping people put a face to the transplant statistics and writing a blog about life waiting for transplant (you can read the blog here or via the link in the right hand column). I'm really honoured to have been asked to do this and will do my best to keep people thinking about organ donation.

Another piece of good news is that I'm doing realy well on my Open University course. The last two essays I have written were some of the hardest I've encountered and no one could have been more suprised than I was when I recieved an A grade for both of them!!! The first A grades I've recieved on any of my OU courses. It really has made all the hard work worthwhile but more than that its made me feel valuable and like I've achieved something. As I have said over on the ambassador blog, studying is something that has nothing to do with illness but is the one thing that remains just for me. To do well on it makes me unbelievably satisfied and happy.
The course has done more for me than just cheer me up, it has made me seriously consider what I want to do study wise. I have enjoyed this literature based course more than any of the others I have done and am so far doing well on it. It is making me think about changing my degree subject to a BA in Literature. This would mean me doing a few more courses but I really think deep down this could be right for me. I know it sounds completely mad to change this late in the day! (and very unlike me) but I have to compromise on so many things why should I not take a leap of faith here? A Literature degree would make more sense for any acting dreams I have and if I find the work more enjoyable then I think its worth it. I'm still yet to decide properly but its something I'm very seriously considering.
On the not so good side I have been finding myself struggling more lately. I have reached the point in my course where I'm kept very busy and there is a lot riding on these last few months/essays. I am also struggling more with my health. I had a good clinic visit at the end of January but for months now I have been getting more breathless/exhausted with trivial things. Last month I had my oxygen levels checked to see if I required more oxygen to make my life easier. Everything is coming back as stable, my lung function is stable, oxygen is ok, blood tests showed my infection markers are fine, all definate positives......but I still feel awful on a day to day basis. It sounds awful but I almost feel as though I'm hovering in an area in between 'ill enough to do something and ok enough that theres nothing that will make a difference' and to be honest I'd rather be one or the other. Its been over 2 and a half years since I went on the list and while I expect things to have declined, it is very very hard to feel you need help and support but not to recieve it. Over the last few weeks I have become very wheezy and my chest often feels very uncomfortable. My treatment regieme barely leaves me any time to study and I feel like what I want to do has to take a back seat. Its like the CF is getting bigger and I'm getting smaller.
I'm determined to finish my course and to do it to the very best of my ability but when I am constantly doing meds or feeling ill it is becoming almost impossible (see here). Things like my blog, keeping in touch with friends etc are falling down my list and I'm struggling to keep my head above water at the moment.
That said, I will keep going until things get easier. I will do as much as i can even in the small snatches of time that I get away from treatments. I will keep on because of how lucky I am to still be here and because I will not let CF take away something else I hold so dear to me. I want this transplant so badly now, this life at the moment is making me appreciate how good things are going to become one day. There are so many things right now that I have to push to the back of my mind because I can't do them and to think about them physically hurts me. I miss so many aspects of the life I haven't even been able to begin yet.
If I'm not around much lately you will now know why, I'm still here (even if a little worse for wear) and I'm keeping on, the only way I know how.
Firstly, I get to go on tour with my brother again. We're biking across BC and to the West Coast. woot woot! and I was just talking to both my brothers over the phone, so that's made me even more excited.

Secondly, I don't have to be in school anymore! and I get to be active all day!!!! YES!!!! I mean, I LOVE LOVE LOVE physics 30, it's the most amazing course I've taken so far in my life and I would definitely go to university to get into noetic science and atomic physics and all that jazzzzzz. But that would mean that I would have to get high school diploma...and I'm too bored with school to do that. why go through everyone else's motions when I can just take my own path? I'll learn just as much this way. and if I have my way about it, I'll be talking to plenty of people who know about science in my lifetime. for the simple reason that I'm manifesting it. So. 

Thirdly...it's freaking SUMMER. who ISN'T excited about it?? =P

And in the next couple of years I'm hoping to be on the other land mass, touring around Europe and Africa and Asia and Australia AND, this is the one I want to go to most, ThE MiDdLe EaSt!!!!!!!!!!! I'm soooo excited to go to Israel and Afghanistan and India and Syria and Lebanon and TURKEY!!!! especially Turkey. 

However, I'm feeling productive, so I believe I shall go sew something.

Peace and Love, my dear friends!!!
If you are looking for a fun way to keep busy, the coming weekend will be a busy and exciting one in the Adirondack North Country. On Saturday, the best alpine skiers in the United States will be racing at Whiteface competing for the national title. From March 20-23, Whiteface Mountain in Wilmington, New York, will once again host the VISA U.S. Alpine Championships. Naturally, a number of Olympians fresh in from the Vancouver Olympic Games, including U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Lindsey Vonn, U.S. Silver Medalist Julia Mancuso, U.S. Bronze Medalist Andrew Weibrecht, and U.S. Olympians Ted Ligety and Steve Nyman will be racing at our own Olympic Mountain.
Back in the Village of Lake Placid, ice hockey will be the cold weather sport of choice when the Village hosts the 2010 NCAA Division III men's ice hockey national championships. The first playoff puck will be dropped on Friday, March 19. 
Not to be forgotten and one of my favorite ways to keep busy is indulging in the incredible spring skiing. We received another 10 inches of snow the night before last and the skiing has been superb. In my book, backcountry skiing luscious corn snow in 50-degree brilliant sunshine is one of the most fun and rejuvenating activities around. The Adirondacks have it all; the excitement and buzz of watching a top-level competition or participating in private ski excursion at your own quiet ski resort in the woods. All you have to do is choose.
Today's featured photo shows the Lake Placid 1932 Olympic Arena, on Main Street, courtesy of Joann Sandone Reed. Today's brilliant blue sky, visible in the photo, and warm sunshine, made today's skiing obligation a delight.
Many people I meet as a marketer ask me how quickly their marketing will lead to sales and ultimately, revenue. I reply by asking them what their time to sale is and what their level of awareness is within their target markets? I also like to understand how many happy customers or clients they have created over time. Occasionally I get some puzzled looks. Whenever I do, I offer this simple Marketing lesson. 
Have you ever heard of the principle that one satisfied customer can bring you up to 10 more customers in a shorter amount of time than you can build them all by yourself? Well, let me show you why:
There is five stages to building a customer from no-awareness to full blown evangelist. Get it right and you'll only have to go through the initial campaigns once or twice to build the initial base of satisfied customers extolling your virtues. 
This is the foundation I build many marketing campaigns on, ensuring I have strategies to take a potential customer on the journey through each stage.  
Awareness: You must make a customer aware of your product or service category, your business and its capability. At this point of the process, lets face it, many potential targets are largely disinterested or indifferent as they can't see a need for your product or service in their life much of the time. This step is a hard, often cold part of the sales process, full of apathy and rejection. 
Interest: Something happens in a potential target's life or business for them to move from basic awareness phase and raise their interest in your offering. A target cannot get to interest if you haven't raised awareness of your brand and offering or capability with them — except through step five: satisfaction. This is the point of a process where we would qualify a target as a warm lead and nurture them carefully to build their interest into hungry desire.
We're leaving one  hot, dirty, sandstorm-riddled area in Africa and are headed to a hot, dirty sandstorm riddled area in the gulf.   Why?? for the love of all that's holy WHY? YOU ASK!? (as did I?)  Because (a) Stupid Sudan is having national elections soon and I am supposed to be here so I can pretend to care deeply about the "issues" facing Sudan so I can't be gone long; and (b) Josh is participating in a triathlon in Abu Dhabi.  -- Which is apparently why he insisted on hoggin the mail fairy so his "gear" could arrive and he could be prepared for his race and not die.  I'm guessing I probably shouldn't have eaten his power bars...but seriously, who could have known! 

There should have been a sign.

And finally (since I really don't have anything to say) I would just like to point out that we watched a movie this weekend (which I also realize you guys probably all saw like 6 months ago, but just be polite and pretend to listen) "The Road"  with that one guy who was in Hidalgo and used to be soo dreamy until I found out that he likes to write poetry and commune with Nature (that's not my way).    Did you guys see this?? The world is basically dying (I'm still not sure why, or what happened frankly) and that guy in Hidalgo and his son try to go south and avoid cannibals (why are cannibals always depicted like they're from West Virginia?  And why do people from West Virginia always manage to LIVE when everyone else dies off...the inbred people seem to thrive in a catastrophe.....someone should really study that or something.  Learn their secret.)

ANYWAY, I'm not sure what happened, or why I watched that movie.  All I know is that I am going to hoard some shoes (?? No, I'm not sure what happened to everyone's shoes frankly) and some canned fruit cocktail.  Don't ask questions.....trust me.  Just do it. 

You never know when something will happen that will make all the animals die and
Jenni and I were driving in the car this afternoon when she began to tell me about a situation at her work. She was telling me about a fellow employee who was sent into the office to discuss some issues. She incredulously told me that his infraction was so bad that he had to talk to the (and I quote) "SBO". I replied, "Do you mean CEO"? Jenni: "Oh yeah...what is a SBO?" Me: "Isn't that a Student Body Officer?" Jenni: "hahahahahahha! What is a CEO?" Me: "Chief Executive Officer". Jenni: "Oh, yeah that one" Never a dull moment.
“The web is becoming a live medium — sales and auctions happen in time, product launches, chats with celebrities, live video events and audio, games, events in virtual worlds — there are a huge amount of scheduled things taking place,” says Nova Spivack, who recently sold off his semantic web search engine Twine to Evri. Now he’s setting out to create a massive programming guide to those live online events, called Live Matrix.
Spivack last year brought on Sanjay Reddy, who’d done corporate development at Gemstar-TV Guide and led its sale to Macrovision for $2.8 billion. Reddy knew from experience that TV watchers spend 10 percent of their time watching TV on the interactive programming guide (per set-top box data). The web has much more going on at any one time, but nothing like an IPG.
Does that metaphor carry over? That’s what Spivack, who’s serving as Live Matrix chairman, and Reddy, the CEO, want to find out. They plan to launch in May and gave me a look at the pre-release site under the condition that I not release screenshots. I’ll tell you a bit more about what they’re doing and describe in words what it looks like.
First of all, there’s the prototypical grid interface — though instead of listing channels due to preset numbers like on TV, they’re dynamically ordered based on demand. Log in during March Madness? That’s going to be on top. If a web metaphor is more your style, you can look at all the events in a Digg-like interface. Users can pull events into a personal playlist and receive reminders when they start. If you actually want to watch something, Live Matrix sends you to the host site rather than framing the content.
I just sent this video (That's My King) to my best friend and her response is overwhelming! Her awe reminds me of my own awe, her joy of my own joy, her faith of my own faith. It's just what I needed to keep on going... so many things to say about my king- words that barely describe him already put me in silence. 

I've been avoiding the monologues-I've been sitting on the computer doing everything else. I've been eating grapes, talking on the phone, asking help for the monologues, getting ideas for the monologues, talking about the monologues but not actually doing them.

"I think I'm avoiding monologues... I guess I am scared God won't provide..." and do you know what she said? "GOD IS A PROVIDER, HE ALWAYS PROVIDE." What I need to do is: just believe. This is where I stop thinking abstractly about faith and live it out. Step one- just start. He will not pick you up from the ground, no, He will help you up as you overcome, you must start walking (faith) and He will lift you (grace) and you will fly...

P.s. God remembers us and who we are! He sends angels...
Now, these may have been around for ages, we can't really be sure because, truth be told, it's pretty rare for us to troll the aisles of Kohl's makeup section looking for KIRFs. Regardless, a helpful, hawk-eyed reader snapped this shot of an eyeshadow palette -- called eyemobile -- that's got the distinct iPhone aura going on, though we're 100 percent certain this is an unauthorized use case. It's hard to say from the photo, but it also looks like there's a lip gloss palette in the background (which we assume is called lipmobile), and that, friends, we would pay money for. Lots of money.
It started out innocently enough. Last week while on the phone with my mom and one of my sisters, the subject turned to movies. I told them how excited I was about Alice in Wonderland and joked that I even considered making a "mad hat" just for the occasion. After all, one can't have so many favorites in one project and not commemorate. (Those favorites being Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Anne Hathaway, Helena B-Carter and the tale of Alice, of course.) We all got a good laugh out of it, and then the topic of conversation changed again. I thought no more of it until the next day.


At work I looked around my desk at all the random doo-dads and trinkets. I knew why they were there - to add a bit of whimsy to my space, some fun and silliness. "Ha!" I thought to myself, "Could you imagine putting those things on a hat? How curious." I came home, and while taking off my jewelry, I noticed more little things on my dresser: various pins and buttons, a pocket-watch that still needs a chain, a fuzzy lapel pin that looks a lot like a Tribble.
"Well, I do seem to have the materials, if I were so inclined..."



Thursday night found me with all manner of delicious nonsense spread out across my coffee table.

"But you love that hat," HomeBoy said.

"None of the changes will be permanent," I assured him, "I'm only using hat pins and tape." 

I had forgotten how much fun arts and crafts can be. Fixing and fastening, arranging, rearranging, positioning just so... I really did enjoy myself. And, in true childlike fashion, I couldn't wait to show it - "Look what I made!"


The silliest part may be that I'm not at all embarrassed. At no point did I feel like I was too old to do such a thing. To be honest, I am quite relieved to find I am capable of such nonsense.
IN A NUTSHELL: WE HAVE USED THE MODEL #22205 DAILY SINCE 1997

The model 22205 is almost an exact twin of the model offered here, except it was offered for sale to us in 1997. We have 5 children and this brave little toaster has seen alot of service since 1997 without a single problem.

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: 900 WATTS - WHITE ENAMEL FINISH - CRUMB TRAY

We have used and overused this little appliance and while 5 coffee makers and 3 'Foreman Grills' have worn out this toaster keeps toasting just like it always has.

CAUTION: HOT TO THE TOUCH

Like toasters of old, this one is hot to the touch with only thin metal and white baked enamel between your fingers and the red hot nichrome filaments that are powered by 900 watts of electricity. Actually, it was the 900 watts versus 7-800 watts of other toasters that got me to buy this in the first place. It even has a crumb bin! Well, 9.5 years and counting, but soon we may want to replace it for a 'cool-touch', though I think we will always keep this brave little toaster around for sentimental reasons.

Clifford’s own connection to soup is profound. As a ten-year old vacationing in Spain, he is taken for his first meal in a fine dining restaurant: A bowl of soup can be a powerful dish. It recalls memories, warm the heart and soul, and can use up plenty of leftovers in our cupboards and refrigerators. Clifford Wright’s The Best Soups in the World (Wiley 2010) appeals to all these aspects of soup. His book delivers recipes from around the world with intelligent commentary. Even as the weather warms up this Spring, get out the soup pot and make some soup. It starts as almost all soup books do, with basic broths (p. 9) followed by clear soups (p. 19). The real action is in the next chapter on chunky meat soups (p. 41) The first recipe isn’t for a standard beefy mushroom soup, but for Blackfoot Bison and Blackberry Soup (p. 42) for which you need buffalo bones, suet and meet and spicebush berries, all of which might be hard to find. Clifford calls the recipe a “curiosity”, but he expects the reader to make the soup, even with the substitute ingredients of beef bones, suet and meat, and juniper berries. What is really interesting is that in the recipe notes he writes about who the Blackfoot Nation are (three different tribes) and a bit of their culinary culture.

He follows with a recipe for Shchi (p. 44), the Russian beef and sauerkraut (or fresh cabbage) soup that has a thousand variations, and Borshch (p. 46), along with an essay on “Everything You Want to Know About Borshch” that covers the history of borshch and the boscht belt. From there Clifford roams the world, from Greece with Avgolemono Meatball Soup (p. 50) to Polish Zurek (p. 54) to Turkmen Boiled Soup (p. 63). There are side essays that fill you in about soup practices in Africa or specific kinds of obscure soups. Although there is a wealth of information, the recipes dominate – this is a book to cook with and enjoy.
"Next up, blood-thirsty bunnies Marlo is officially down to two naps. For those of you who do not have children, that first sentence will mean nothing to you. For those of you who do, you probably just experienced an instinctual pain in your chest at the memory of what it means to plan your life around your baby's sleep schedule. Or is that just me? I can't be the only one who has run outside and verbally berated the garbage truck driver for disturbing a nap, THERE GOES THE REST OF MY DAY. Garbage truck diver, snow plower, mail carrier... all have been informed at one time or another of Marlo's sleep schedule. It goes like this: when Marlo's asleep, no one is allowed to breathe. The end.
You don't want that crazy, short-haired Southern lady who looks like an eight-year-old boy running out into the street in her bare feet. She may be liberal, but she's related to people who own guns. And just this week we've managed to manipulate her schedule so that she's sleeping in until 6:30 AM. Do you have any idea how indulgent this feels, to sleep in so late? No, you don't understand. It like we're fifteen years old, and suddenly the prophet has declared that pre-marital sex is totally okay. I guess I should say, that one time we slept in so late since our other child has decided that days now begin at 5 AM. Read that again: FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. You want to know why? Because she thinks a leprechaun is tapping on her window. I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence. I mean, I can understand a fear of spiders or earthquakes or rats that are big enough to eat your face off. But, little green dudes? If anything you want them at your party because they can hold their liquor. Also, don't they all come with marshmallows? And, I don't remember ever talking to her about leprechauns, so I'm guessing this is one of those rotten things she picked up at school, like addition and subtraction. And what do you know, IT IS. Turns out one has been coming into their classroom and leaving notes in the days leading up to St. Patrick's Day. And this afternoon when I told her teacher about this early-morning tapping leprechaun, she said with a gleam in her eye, ""Oh yes, he'd be tapping, for sure. They're cobblers, you know.""
HAHA! I'm laughing because, that is just so damn brilliant. They have to deal with our kids all day long, and oh no. Is your kid waking up early? How sad for you who get to send them AWAY ALL DAY. It's like, if I'm going to blame the teacher for the leprechaun, she's more than happy to break out her fifty-page, single-spaced document of quirks she'd like explained, thank you very much.

This iron hardly got hot enough to flatten anything. Very little heat production, maybe faulty item, but warranty service was poor. My hair is quite curly and so needs straighening every day. The sedu does straighten reasonable well but it takes quite a lot of time and also the machine has a design fault (or so it seems) as it is extremely easy to trap your fingers in it while using it. I was impressed by the sound of the product having tourmaline plates which are meant to help prevent split ends.I like it very much! i like the 1" better than the wider 1 1/2" because i have bangs (that absolutly MUST be staightened) but it still works GREAT on my long hair. and it makes it sooo soft. and well that just makes me smile.so just buy it already. really you will be so glad you made the choice. I used to straighten my hair in the salon and it takes me too much time. Then my friend suggest me to try it myself with a hair straightener. And she recommended SEDU. I really didn't want to spend as much as this hair straightener costs, but after reviews, and needing one that didn't rip my coarse & curly hair to shreds, I relented. Well it is a wonderful tool. It heats up extremely quickly and my hair is shiny, & silky smooth. I'm also applying Biosilk Silk Therapy to my hair prior to flatironing. Thanks to both the flatiron and the Silk Therapy, the formerly very tough job of hair straightening is now far easier for me. Thanks very much!
A few years ago Mark McPherson contacted me out of the blue asking if I was interested in taking part in a book project that focused on Australian and American photographers. I thought, hmm... that's random, but potentially interesting. I knew very little about Australia beyond the cliches of surfing, kangaroos and walkabouts. Since Hijacked was released I have been involved in an intense love affair with the country.

Thank you, Mark, for opening so many doors.

After three weeks touring about New South Wales, I'm now in Perth for a series of Foto Freo related events. Thursday, Stranded will have it's solo debut at the Perth Centre for Photography. The show will include 33 images and I'm nervous and excited to see how they work together. Foto Freo also includes talks and shows by Trente Park, Chien-Chi Chang, Jon Levy and friends and fellow Americans Carrie Levy, Stacy Mehfar and Andy Adams.

Thanks to Bob Hewitt, June Moorhouse, Laura Beilby and the folks at the Perth Centre for Photography for inviting me to Australia and Foto Freo. There is an interesting article in Seed Magazine that sums up recent research around the growing debate of whether animals are people. It would appear that many of the traits we have long considered uniquely human are not so unique after all. The debate feels less like a struggle for scientific clarity and more like a brainy ape's desperate attempt to hold on to his fragile sense of supremacy.

Instead of "what makes us human" being a question where we are able to constantly adjust the answer, maybe we should make it a statement and choose a definition that commits us to a more humane standard of dominion. A year ago I met Stacy Mehrfar for a drink at the Half King in Chelsea. We'd known each other since our early days printing in the color darkroom at the ICP, but on that day Stacy was in town from Sydney, where she lives with her husband Gavin. As we were catching up over a drink and talking about her new adopted country, she mentioned a strange phrase, Tall Poppy Syndrome. Tall Poppy Syndrome is an Australian societal phenomenon where people who are seen to be successful are resented by their fellow citizens. Having been raised in a country that preaches the religion of individual success (USA! USA! USA!), this concept was foreign to me. As we discussed it further we decided it would be a great structure for a photo series about Australia.
THE ELEGANT WOMAN in the pink silk kimono attracts admiring glances from be-suited businessmen and elderly Japanese women as she walks through the narrow, tourist-choked streets leading to Tokyo's Sensoji Temple. The locals here in the old district of Asakusa know a real geisha when they spot one — even if she is a tall Westerner with olive-green eyes. From her rounded bun hairstyle to her pigeon-toed tabi socks, Sayuki, otherwise known as anthropologist Fiona Graham, is decked out so immaculately in true geisha style that her admirers utter the same compliment as she passes by: kirei desu ne — she's beautiful.

Sayuki denies she's a flawless example of Japan's ancient flower and willow world. "Being a geisha takes a lifetime to perfect," she deflects, as she clacks along in lacquer sandals that she wears slightly too small to make her size-8 feet look more petite. Sayuki, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, became the first foreign woman in the notoriously closed profession's 400-year history to formally debut as a geisha two years ago, in late 2007. "I've only just begun," she says. "To many of my geisha sisters, I'm still a walking disaster."

It's all relative. Near Sensoji's majestic red gateway, gaggles of female Japanese tourists are clad in flowery kimonos — a new retro fashion trend. Sacrilegiously, they've added lace and frills to the fabric and wear garish costume jewelry. "Also, they don't wear underwear. The geisha elders are scandalized," laughs Sayuki, with only a faint Aussie twang in her girlish voice. "I'm wearing four layers of lingerie under my kimono, so at least I've got that right." Flaunting womanly curves is considered vulgar in the refined geisha realm; the layered undergarments, resembling silk bandages, ensure a tubular, demure silhouette.
