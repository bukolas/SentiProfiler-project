The comments on any youtube video are many times the best part of that video. I wouldn't say that's the case with I AM DRUGS however. The talented folks involved in making these short, fake PSA's precludes them from low balling the viewer. That said, most of the vids in this series consistently get passed around, and every few months, a few of them receive another 20,000 or so hits seemingly over night. 

And when they do, the next day is like Christmas morning for us here at Drink at Work.

Based on the comments, it seems that perhaps 10% of the viewers understand the videos are a joke. The rest are fiercely angry at what they believe to be government anti-drug propaganda... or even better, the misinformation they claim we're sharing. 

Mostly it's the pot heads who get riled up, but lately the PCP crowd and the DM42 fans have been chiming in with their own personal experiences with these respective substances.


None of which matters. What does matter is that these people are insane, numerous, and love to have fights on our youtube vid comments sections. And here is some of that magic for you today
