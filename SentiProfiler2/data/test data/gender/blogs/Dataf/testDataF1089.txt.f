Jenni and I were driving in the car this afternoon when she began to tell me about a situation at her work. She was telling me about a fellow employee who was sent into the office to discuss some issues. She incredulously told me that his infraction was so bad that he had to talk to the (and I quote) "SBO". I replied, "Do you mean CEO"? Jenni: "Oh yeah...what is a SBO?" Me: "Isn't that a Student Body Officer?" Jenni: "hahahahahahha! What is a CEO?" Me: "Chief Executive Officer". Jenni: "Oh, yeah that one" Never a dull moment.
