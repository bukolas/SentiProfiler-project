It's been more than a month since I posted anything here. There is so much to do, plus my mood has been off. But I am finding myself really missing the journaling aspect of blogging, especially therapeutic journaling. Blogger, heal thyself!

I have a week's (unpaid) vacation from my job, and today I am cleaning house as I work on my to-do list. Sewing, decorating, and gardening are how I would most like to spend this time. More moving-in and organizing have to be on the plan as well. Some priorities are (bleh!) taxes and fencing (*sigh*) to keep the boy dogs from fighting. 

Dunno why, but I DID NOT EXPECT THIS!! Harley is not the simple laid-back, big squishy teddy bear he appears to be, and has now decided to make his move for dominance. Or is it his intention to completely eliminate the competition? I can't tell. As he grew much larger than Frankie, he began to show a little more aggression in regard to being close to his people and being first for treats. Less than a week after his neutering, we had an incident over a collar and leash they both wanted (to them, these evidently mean being singled out for special treatment) and ended up with a badly wounded Frankie, and also a wounded Mama (me). Poking your finger into a fighting St. Bernard's mouth is not the best idea for breaking his hold. Four days later my fingers on the other hand were also injured and Frankie's wounds were opened, and I learned that this was not something we were going to be able to put behind us for a long time, if ever.

One of the happiest parts of my daily life has been sharing it with my three dogs, so you can imagine how bummed I am feeling. At all times, one of them must be either outside, in the laundry room, or in the crate. Coordinating their quality time inside and out is very unsatisfying for all and very time-consuming for me. We did find a really good article on this type of aggression, which has given us some hope, and our next plan is to install a good gate in the middle of the house and to create a separation of yards outside. Otherwise, we will have to find Harley a new home where he can be the only dog, without competition for affection and attention.

Damn.
