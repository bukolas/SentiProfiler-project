Achu hmmm first thing that comes to mind is discipline( he is always late by ten to fifteen mins for any work).. sincere(this is not restricted just to studies).. hardworking he is, jst loves burning the midnight oil and makes sure the other guy(it was me back in school) also loses sleep.. 4ams were a routine

beach,movies,football,basketball,tv,pc games,Mcrennet,zeta jones,411 if i can recollect r some of his fav pasttimes and hangouts.. and now he has a bike so imagine and yet he finds time to study.. i feel sad tht v dint end up in the same coll

he has his own principles and his own ways of doing things and one has to respect him for tht.. when im down i do get some advice from him... very trustworthy and reliable... im sure he will make it big in the future..

finally, bcos ur name appears first in my cell contacts and Y! messenger list(as it is for others) guys mistake it for some girl's and i get to be a bit popular and maintain some level of 'gethu'... one good reason to remain ur friend :-)
