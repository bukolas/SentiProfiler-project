You know this has been the most useful internet tool I’ve ever used. now me being the internet/cp retard I’ve been known to be, I know that isn't that impressive. On that note though look at what you can do with it. you can advertise a band(and don't think the record industry ain't lookin), but for me I’ve located so many friends that I wanted to open a line of communication with, and found people I thought I might never talk to again. I’m so glad i heard of thios fuckin site. To all my friends out there I raise one to you all and toast the connection we will all share for as long as were alive......friendship. and to the people who have not yet become my friend, HELL raise a glass and make a toast to the people that truly make your life shine.
