Oh I hear ya...He's just a two year old how hard could it be?Ah-ha, thought you'd never ask!Here's just one example of what I've been going through...Just the other day...I had to make a very important phone call. As the phone on the other end is ringing, I spotted Madisen and asked her to run and see where Jake was. ( As I know it only takes a second before he's into something.) "He's fine, Kailey's going to play with him while your on the phone." , She said.Approximately 20 minutes later I get off the phone, turn around, and see Jake walking towards me waddling like a duck. He's covered from head to toe with paint, making paint footprints behind him. "Look Mommy, I paint!!" he said in a lovely shade of purple.I can only imagine the haunting shade of white my face became, as the shock rushed over me. I immediately grabbed him up and went running for the bath tub. Screaming in panic for the girls to hurry and help, I went as fast as I could. "Strip your clothes off, and what ever you do, DO NOT let Jake out of the tub!!"I knew wherever the paint was, time was of the essence to get it up. As I followed the painted footprints imprinted in the carpet. (Of our RENTED house might I ad) I was led straight to the masterpiece corner! He had somehow managed to get open two containers of paint. One Red &amp; one blue.(Which were in a case and up high. Obviously not high enough!)Mr. Man, had painted the walls, his toys, his bed, his bedding, and HIMSELF!
