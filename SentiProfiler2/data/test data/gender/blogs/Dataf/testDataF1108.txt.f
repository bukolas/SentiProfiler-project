Eco fashion has been a profoundly online phenomenon from the get-go.  Slowly but surely, however, boutiques are cropping up all over North America and Europe.  If you’re in Vancouver, you don’t want to miss the chance to check out Body Politic founded by Nicole Ritchie-Oseen in 2008 and located in the South Main district of the city.  Body Politic features some of the hottest green designers including Stewart + Brown, Elroy and Perfectly Imperfect.

Ritchie-Oseen says, “At body politic we began with the belief that sustainable and eco-friendly clothing didn’t mean sacrificing style. The goal was to fuel our absolute love of fashion and distinct style without compromising our environment, our community, or ourselves!”

The space is as green as the fashion, with energy efficient lighting, re-purposed furniture and raw concrete walls as a neutral palette against which the carefully selected clothing and accessories stand out beautifully.

Can’t make it to Vancouver?  No worries!  Body Politic also sells online at www.bodypolitic.ca.  You can also keep up with the official Body Politic Blog, follow them on Facebook, and on Twitter.

Supporting eco fashion designers and retailers is one of the best ways we can put our money where our ethics is.

Doctors, supplies, and provisions must continue to be sent to assist families that are still suffering from the effects of losing everything–including loved ones.

To answer the call, the independently owned jewelry company Love Heals has created four special pieces of which they will donate 100% of the profits to Doctors Without Borders.  If you’ve never heard of Love Heals, check out their website and touching story:
