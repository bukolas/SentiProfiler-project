Of course, it provided an explanation in turn for Connie’s place in Harry and Ethel’s household. Thank goodness for them providing her with a loving home. The sampler is all the more special for the mistake – Annie must have been concentrating hard on her stitches! February 20, 2010 Anonymous said... Am enjoying these stories about Harry's family. I miss the blog but am so happy Harry made it safe. Will be checking often to see how rest of his life went on. Thanks Bill, this is history at its best. A loyal reader in US. February 19, 2010 Anonymous said...Love the blog and sad to see it coming to conclusion. Can I ask what the deliberate mistake is in the sampler? I keep looking at it and not seeing it. Thanks! February 19, 2010 Pte Harry Lamin said... Shall I give it away? We're too familiar with words and so don't look at them properly once our brains have decoded them. I'd guess Annie got a ruler across her hand for this - or similar. BL February 20, 2010 Anonymous said...Ah yes, now I see it. You are correct my brain was seeing what it thought it should be seeing, not what was actually there. February 22, 2010 Anonymous said...True :) but you'd be amazed how people love solving these sort of mysteries. Did you say George had a middle name? I vaguely remember that but can't see it in update? Could there be a Lacey family connection? Could the father be Mr Hutchinson? Or have I been watching too many 'Upstairs Downstairs' type dramas? :) I have solved a similar situation in my own family history, it's not impossible to do so, even at a distance. I am working on others. It may be possible to find out who Connie's father was much more easily - I think you noted she had a middle name that might have been the surname of her father? By the way I've really enjoyed your project and am really enjoying the updates now. Thank you. March 05, 2010 I don't know of any middle name for George so that isn't much help, I'm afraid. I suppose I could ask Ken, in Australia, if he knows anything about his grandfather. Connie's middle name was Wilkinson. That may a direct link to her father. I did have an email about a Mr wilkinson that sounded promising &nbsp;but, when I followed it up, got no further contact. BL colagirl said...I'm sorry to hear that the man behind the maps of Harry's progress is gone. My thoughts and sympathy are with his wife and children on this unfortunate event. Nevertheless, he leaves behind a contribution that has been appreciated the world over. February 11, 2010 Lee said...I served with Jono in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. I saw your comments on the Dukes web site and your note on your blog. Jono was my first platoon commander in 1979. I recall that no matter how cold it was, or how windy or wet, he would always strip off to the waist and have a daily wash out of his mess tin with the tiniest flannel on this planet. This he would do in full view of his troops without a shiver, If ever I felt cold or miserable, just looking up to my platoon commander made me feel safe.&nbsp; He earned our trust in him, we would have followed him to hell he was such a leader. He guided us to the champion platoon of the battalion and steered us through 2 tours of Northern Ireland before being promoted to Captain. Later he became company commander but never forgot his boys from 4 platoon, the champion platoon.&nbsp; I attach a picture for you of the platoon, Jono is unmistakably sat centre front, I am 5th in on the rear rank.. He was a special leader, the sort you do not come across very often, and sadly you do not realise until it is too late. Many of his 4 platoon boys went on to have fulll and varied army careers. It is only later in life after working with several platoon commanders and numorous officers that one realises how good Jono was at what he did. Regards ex WO2 Lee Greenwood, formerly, Private, Lance Corporal, and Corporal of 4 Platoon led by the then Lt Wood&nbsp; February 07, 2010 Roger O'Keeffe said...How sad, and how untimely. I hadn't even registered the fact that he missed the trip, I just assumed that he was there with you, even if there was no direct reference to him in your account of it. His family must be devastated. It will be small consolation to them, but they should know that all the time that he spent contributing background material to the blog was greatly appreciated by a worldwide community. February 07, 2010 Gustav's greatgranddaughter said...'Maryland's' comment says it well: Major Woods' maps and diagrams were a wonderful addition to this blog, and greatly appreciated. Our thanks to him, and condolences to his family. - February 05, 2010 Rocco said...The 4 days adventure on the Asiago Plateau with Bill following Harry's footsteps were full of emotions. With Jono it would have been better. While we were talking of him, wondering why he didn't answer he was already gone. A very sad story. I hope his family will deal with this hard fate February 04, 2010 Maryland said...Major Wood's contributions to the blog were enormously helpful to me. I would like his family to know how much we readers appreciate his work. Our prayers go out for those who mourn his passing. Thank you, Bill, for sharing the news. February 04, 2010 Anonymous said...She was obviously much loved. January 29, 2010 Anonymous said... Nineteen years may not be much, but for Connie, they were very GOOD years. Many families of the era would have 'thrown away' a 'damaged' or born-out-of-wedlock child, perhaps leaving them at an orphanage; the Lamin family did not. Connie was loved and cherished, by Harry and Ethel, Kate and the young Willie; if they didn't talk about her much after her death, perhaps it was from their honest grief at losing her. January 30, 2010 Tricia Gurnett said...It's a lovely song, and beautifully sung. Thank you for the song, and the inspiring website. February 15, 2010 Anonymous said...Thanks for your post. This song is really fantastic. The lines are mind touching. So sweet and melodious voice. Slide pictures are nice. Thanks. February 05, 2010 Roger O'Keeffe said...Schools don't always spot musical talent. Cf. this extract from an interview with Ken Robinson, an inspiring advocate of an education that does more to let people's creativity and other gifts develop: "...I don't mean to say that you have to have failed at school before you can be a success, but an awful lot of people who did well after school didn't do well in school. Paul McCartney went to school in Liverpool and, as you say, he went through the whole of his education there and nobody thought he had any musical talent. One of the other people in the same (...) music class was George Harrison, the lead guitarist of The Beatles, and he went through school as well and nobody noticed he had any talent. So (...)one teacher in Liverpool in the '50s had half The Beatles in his class and he missed it." Google "Ken Robinson TED" for more in the same vein. January 28, 2010 I rather like being compared to Paul McCartney. I'm sure that's not what you meant, but I'll take it anyway. BL Diane said...I have loved listening to this song and reading this blog particularly as I had an uncle who was in the 1st world war but I never knew he existed until I started doing genealogy a few years ago. Unfortunately, he was invalided home before the end of the war and I have been unable to trace him after that. I was very happy and relieved to hear Harry arrived home safe and sound but I'll miss the blog. Thank you for all your hard work in letting us share Harry's story. January 24, 2010 Jo said...A lovely song which works really well with the slideshow - thank you! January 23, 2010 Parkylondon said...I turned the music down as you suggested and watched the slideshow. Nice. I then realised that the music I could hear wasn't coming from the bedroom (i.e. my wife listening to something) but my headphones. I picked them up, put them on and had a listen. Fairly quickly I realised I nearly missed out on a really good piece of music which matches the slideshow really well. Thank you for posting this. Well done. January 22, 2010 Tom Maher said...Be very proud of all of your work! Following Harry through civvie life would be rewarding, as we already have a good sense of the man. Again - Thank You! St. Louis January 21, 2010 Mecha said...Thank you for sharing, I enjoyed it because of the lovely harmony and the fact that it told a story. January 20, 2010 Kittybriton said...A lovely gentle, tender song. As much as the letters of Harry, I think it catches the mood of the readers: "What'chu doing Harry?". Together with the video it makes the thousands of men in khaki suits a little less anonymous. January 20, 2010 Alan said...Very, very moving with the images from the book and blog.

January 19, 2010 This set of comments is the result of a delightful session with a class of French students. Their resourceful teacher had asked me to answer their questions about Harry and his blog, in order to practise their spoken English.&nbsp; We had a Skype session with a webcam and used up a valuable and enjoyable hour. If any other school would like to repeat the exercise, don't hesitate to contact me. BL Sarah, Doulcet and Oksana said...

BL Sarah and Nick said...Wow, where to start. I began reading your blog after I read an article on CNN. I am currently deployed to Iraq and have been keeping a journal of my day to day activities...With email and SKYPE to keep connected to family there is no need to "write" home. The journal will help me pass my "memories" for my son and hopefully someday grandchildren to enjoy. I will be headed home in June to be with my family after a 6 month tour...I can't imagine what it would have been like for Harry after 16 months without leave. He is a true hero and I thank you for your dedication to his memory. May God bless you and your family. Sarah, Camp Victory, Iraq February 07, 2010 Anne said...Wonderful. I do hope Harry and family settled down well together. Must have been a bit of adjustment for all of them. Thank you so much for the blog. Look forward to reading all the ''loose ends'' too. Amersham. January 29, 2010 James said...I started following Harry in the summer of 2007. We had sheep and a smallholding, moved to Norway, had our son, have moved back to the UK. I've changed in that time. Nothing in comparison to how Harry and the world will have changed in the same time. I hope he manages/managaged to cope with the rest of his life. I'll be visiting the war graves at Nijmegen on my way home.

And all your comrades - soldiers and teachers and just plain humans - who somehow help to make us all more human by sharing glimpses into your lives. I'm planning t
 donate some blood in your honor, Harry (I haven't much money, but perhaps that is more valuable....) and then make a trip to the San Francisco, California USA WWI veterans memorial and the Presidio cemetery.... as a thank you to both of you and all your contemporaries. Thank you, Bill, for helping this history to come alive, and to help us to share the journey with Harry and his mates all these months. This is what the passing on of History really ought to be.... My parish Church has a chalice donated at Christmas 1919 as a prayer that there will never again be another war of this magnitude.... and I will think of &amp; pray for you both whenever it is used...Gratefully, Linda H-F, San Francisco, CA January 24, 2010 Robin in Ohio said...Bill, Thanks for your hard work on this blog. I've enjoyed it very much and am pleased to hear that Harry arrived home safely. Please let us know more about Harry and his family. What happened after he returned from the war? Thanks, Robin in Ohio January 25, 2010 AG said... Just back from holiday to find that Harry is home at last; squealed with glee, though now I wonder what I'll do without his semi-regular letters! (I wonder if Ethel missed the letters sometimes too, and read them in odd moments? It can be so lovely to look back on such things after it's all ended happily, can't it.) Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for publishing these -- for giving your faithful readers a glass through which to look back on the sacrifices of the Great War, and for being such a faithful curator of these precious family documents. All the best to you and yours, and I'll raise a glass this evening in Harry's memory. January 24, 2010 Sgt Sam Avery said...Hello Harry: Glad to hear you're finally home. Long business getting back there, what? As for me, still in France and making my way to the coast at a snail pace. Stop by for a read when you can. Regards, Sam PS. Bill, I know how you must feel at the journey's end. I'm dreading it myself, except for the fact that my own book project is still in the works as a distraction from the emotion of it all being "over." Best of luck with the loose ends. Rich January 24, 2010 Dieter Finzen said...Bill, Thank you so much for doing this brilliant blog – besides providing great information about the individual perspective of war, your blog was THE inspiration for future “historical blogs” to come. Even though I have just started my own historical blog, I can tell how much effort you must have put into this unique project! All the best - you wrote internet history for sure! January 24, 2010 Marcy said...When I first started reading, very soon after you started posting, I was desperate to know if Harry made it home. I didn't want to go through weeks of letters to find out he died in 1917 or something. When I got the book and found he survived, I was so pleased! but I'm also glad that I went through the weeks of letters because it's been a fantastic experience. Harry wasn't famous, he didn't become a politician or campaigner, he was just one of many soldiers who endured an awful event. Despite his modest status, to me he really is a hero. Thank you Bill and thank you Harry. January 22, 2010 meg's mommy said...This was an amazing blog and I have so enjoyed following Harry's journey. Thank you so much for all you have done.

I like how short and to the point it is. Thank you for posting this amazing project. Doing it in real-time was a wonderful idea. January 19, 2010 Pfc Benjamin Kaplow said... Please accept my gratitude for taking us on your journey to honor your grandfather. His letters about his WW1 experiences are now a part of history for all to read. Thank goodness you rescued them from that drawer where they were tucked away for so many years. A huge thank you for sharing them with so many of us throughout the world. I bet you never dreamt what your future would hold as you picked up that first letter from the drawer to read. So happy Harry is home safely. Thanks for the book, too. And to top it off, I can’t get Harry’s song out of my head. I imagine it will become background music for the audio book. Keep up the good work. My very best, Florence January 17, 2010 Elizabeth said...I cried! I am so glad that Harry is safely home at long last. What happened next? I want know more about the family!

Bill, sincerely, thank you for your investment in time and humanity through this journey. Lest others forget... January 16, 2010 Tim Douglass said...Wow! I've been following Harry's story since about the second page so it is going to be a bit of a shock to the system to not have any new letters to look forward to. You are to be commended, Bill, for the way you have honored Harry and also all the others who fought for their countries in the great war. January 16, 2010 Anonymous said..."Say it ain't so." I began following the blog when I assigned it to a classroom of community college history students and while they are now long finished with the class, subsequent classes have also followed Harry's journey through World War I. I can remember how excited we were to find out that he survived the war--It has been a joy and pleasure to follow along. Thank you so much for all your hard work.

January 15, 2010 Sheila said...I can imagine how excited Harry's family were to have him home. My earliest memory is of my father returning from World War 11. He just walked into the house. I am told that the telegram announcing his arrival was delivered the following day! Although the family knew he was on his way, they didn't know which day he would come. I wonder if Harry's family were in the same situation. I look forward to finding out what the future held for the Lamin family. January 15, 2010 dean said...Kathryn has made an excellent point...you have brought us into your family (metaphorically speaking)...we have all taken Harry on as kind of a "surrogate grandfather in the War"; so I think we all hope to get a very comprehensive follow-up as to how "Grandpa" made out, and how that led to the very astute and creative grandson we have also come to very fond of. Dean Roosevelt, Toronto January 15, 2010 Kathryn S said...Until I found this, I'd never really seen the point of blogs! This has been brilliant and I'll miss checking up on Harry's progress, not knowing what was around the corner for him. I'm looking forward to hearing how he got on with the post-war period. January 14, 2010 Jim said...Thanks, Bill - it has been a genuine pleasure to watch Harry's story unfold. Really appreciate your efforts not only in telling his story but also posting the contemporary photos, maps, and the accounts of your battlefield visits. Best wishes to you and the Lamin family. From Jim in Washington State, USA. January 14, 2010 Roger O'Keeffe said...I'd already read the book to the end (the temptation to finish it was irresistible!), but still wanted to check in from time to time to know if he is home yet. The "here and now 90 years on" is still a powerful emotional draw. I'm feeling a strange emptiness now, an anti-climax. What must it have been like for Harry and all his comrades, when they finally made it home? They must have felt pretty drained, and wondered what all the preceding years of hardship were for: was it worth it? Probably nostalgia for their mates, both for those that didn't make it, and for those that did survive, but most of whom they would rarely if ever see again. Most accounts indicate that the survivors rarely said much to their families about "what it was like" - both because they wanted to shelter their families from the worst and because words couldn't adequately describe it. For many years it was only among their peers that they would open up and talk about their experiences to those who could understand. A marvellous achievement, Bill, and a great memorial to an ordinary chap who just did what was expected of him. And now it's time for me to head back to the Somme in early 1917, just opposite the British positions on the Ancre, where Dieter has had a more than ample baptism of fire but still has so much to go through. January 14, 2010 Roger, if you have a "strange emptiness now", &nbsp;it begins to explain the devastating feelings I'm experiencing. BL colagirl said...He's home! He's home! He's actually home!

And for standing up to the Kaiser, thank you. January 15, 2010 Endeavourer said...I kept "behind" with the book until late 2009 when I read to the end and was relieved to find Harry's military career was soon to end. I feel privileged to haved shared in a small part of your adventure, Bill, in the trip to Flanders in May 2008. My granddad served in the Sherwood Foresters from 1916, he went 'over the top' twice, and though he survived the Great War his life was badly damaged by it. He lived till my teens and Harry's blog has helped me understand his personal experiences with great pride - Many Thanks!

He never saw any action in WW I, although his brother did, but they never talked about it. I’ve followed your blog daily and very much appreciate what you have done.Thanks, Bill January 14, 2010 The co-ordinator said...It's been a great (true) story, everything good that blogging and the internet can bring.I look forward to your final few round-ups about the characters but then I will have a gap in my daily browsing which will be difficult to fill.

UK January 13, 2010 Bryce said...Hi Bill, This was a wonderful story, and I'm happy that it reached such a good conclusion for Harry. Like many other readers, I will be sad to see it go, and I'll certainly miss seeing new entries appear in my RSS feed list from day to day. All the best to you and yours. Bryce San Angelo, Texas January 13, 2010 Marta said... What a happy letter and such a happy conclusion. I can't wait for the epilogue with what Harry ended up doing, if he was able to and wanted to return to Trumans or if he found some other occupation. I recall he said he never wanted to be a cook after doing so for such a long time in Italy. So I'm sure he didn't do that if there wasn't an opening at his old place. Thank you for providing this insight into a war often passed over very lightly in our United States school systems. Why, I don't know. It was a very important period of history. My grandfather fought in this war too. I was happy to find several fiction authors devote novels and series of novels to this war and have fleshed out my understanding by reading these well researched volumes. Thank you again. Can't wait to read how all the loose ends of your family get tied up.
