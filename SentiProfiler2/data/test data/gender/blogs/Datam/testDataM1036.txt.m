I grew up on a farm outside Cazenovia, NY and attended Harvard College on an ROTC scholarship. I served on active duty in the Marine Corps from 1989 to 1993, including deployment with the 2d Marine Division to Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. After leaving active duty, I worked as a mortgage banker and policy analyst/author before returning to Harvard for my Masters degree in teaching. I have taught history and coached track and cross country at Cazenovia high school since 1996. I've been in the Marine Corps Reserve since leaving active duty and have served with the 4th Civil Affairs Group and 8th Tank Battalion in addition to completing the Marine Corps' Reserve Command and Staff Seminar and Reserve Component National Security Course at National Defense University. My current assignment as a Marine Historian allows me to combine my love of the Corps with my enthusiasm for teaching and history. I hope this site will help me to share my experiences and perspectives with my students and others.
