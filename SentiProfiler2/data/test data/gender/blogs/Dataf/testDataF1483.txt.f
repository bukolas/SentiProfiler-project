Well I was just sitting here wondering what the next step is. Anybody that knows me will tell you that I'm a person who likes things planned out. But at this time in my life I am not the one in charge of making the plans. I have met a wonderful guy who treats me like gold. But when will he ask me to be his wife? I have gotten my diabetes under control. But when will God make me a mother? I have worked so hard on getting to this point in my life I just wonder what's the next step?
