I'm getting carried away. That last drawing session last two songs. I'm frustrated with this wireless internet connection, and this coffee is terrible. I desperately need to get this presentation organized.
One article down. Check out this drawing.

Nearly 9 o'clock. I'm getting cold.

Let's cool down this laptop..

Tomorrow Already
These are the last two pictures I wanted to include in yesterday's post.
It's 3am now, and I'm 40 pages away from the finish line in my text book. So much for trimming :./
I guess I'm pretty well finished with the text book. I'm going to set up a score in Sibelius now. I should reviewn the post hoc tests and then jot down all of the formulas I'll be using on the exam: repated measures t-test, independent measures ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA. The last two sections covered interactions between factors in factorial ANOVAS. I have a general idea of what the Tukey's HSD post hoc test is about, there was another post hoc test called Schaffe that was in the text but I'm not sure we covered it in class, and the LSD, which we covered in class but isn't in the book. I don't remember anything about that one.

What it all boils down to is ratios. Comparing datum grouped by factors, looking for systematic difference, reducing error caused by random variance. That's pretty well the short and long of it. Stats is kinda neat. It's 4am now.
