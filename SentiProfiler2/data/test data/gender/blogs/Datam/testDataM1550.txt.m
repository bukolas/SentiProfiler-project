I traded in my 2003 Ultra Classic (42,000 miles) in August on a new 2009 Ultra Classic. The dealership I bought from was making deals too good to refuse. They even beat a different dealers offer, on a 2008 model no less, by $3000 ! Mine is the new for 2009 Flame Blue Pearl color. It has  turquoise pin-striping as well. So far, having ridden about 2,500 miles, and in 2 other states, I am LOVING it ! It rides smoother and firmer than the "03 did. I attribute this to the new,wider rear tire/wheel.
