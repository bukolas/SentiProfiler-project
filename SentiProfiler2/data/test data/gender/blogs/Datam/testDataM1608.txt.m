Have you ever wondered what is your purpose, beyond "what god has in store for you" or whatever your religion says. Some people would say to make better in the world, but others really don't believe they have much of a purpose. My thought is that its genetically ingrained into us to drive on to do whatever is in our power to keep the race alive.

In essence we're clinging to life like some sort of single-celled life form, such as a disease. All that disease does is travel from host to host until it dies. Our "hosts" are what drives us to strive onward, for example: money, drugs, sex, the people we love, whatever you want.

With that comes Darwin's theory of evolution. If we just keep reproducing, theoretically after maybe millions of years we'd evolve to adapt to what would be essential for survival.

That leaves the question... is there a 'perfect specimen? Could we attain a level of never needing anything to survive and if so, would that mean immortality? It's an interesting question, something to ponder upon.

Once immortality is achieved, the primal need to survive will have been fulfilled. And we are still left to wonder, what is our purpose?
