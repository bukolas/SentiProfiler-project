'Once there was a little girl named Miranda, she lived in a very little cottage up on a hill in Colorado.  Therefore it was very cold.  Knowing that her mother and father were too poor to have a fireplace she decided to try to save up for a heating lamp as a mean of heat!  Well she was only eight years old and didn\'t exactly know how to count or how to earn money.  She would run errands for the more wealthier people such as a lady that lived down the street. This lady who\'s name is Miss Ford was a tailor, and a dressmaker.  Every Saturday and Sunday morning she would go down to Miss Ford\'s show and deliver her nice, new clothings and dresses.  Each house that she delivered to would give her a small tip such as a half dime or a dime on a good day.  Everyday she would give half her money to her mom, and the other half would to toward buying the heat lamp.  Right when she was twenty cents away from having enough to buy the heat lamp her church was going to have a freedman\'s fund which was when people give money to help free the black slaves.  Of course being as kind as Miranda was she decided to give all of her money away!  For Christmas her mom had made her a beautiful plaid dress to wear to church on Christmas day service, which was only done day away.  Then finally it came Christmas day!A long time ago there was a girl with medium length, light brown hair and bright blue eyes.  Her name was Katie Smith. She was thirteen years old, and had one brother named Derik.  Katie really like to play basketball.  She had just finished up the long volleyball season and wanted to try for basketball.  The try outs were on Tuesday and practices were Mondays through Thursday, from 6:30 to 8:30.  So on Tuesday Katie brought her basketball equipment to school.  She was hyped and ready to play!  That day she had done really good at the try outs, so she thought for sure she would make it.  Sure enough the next day her name was on the team list.  Now she had made the team!  She was so happy that she even had a victory party to celebrate!  The next two days she had practice, then on Friday she had her first game.  She was so excited because she knew she\'d do well.  Then there she was only one foot form the net, the ball was passed to her, she shoots, and she misses!  Her mouth dropped open to the floor then she does; then she starts to weep.  That for Katie was the very worst moment of her whole life.  One foot from the basket, and she still misses.  What a shame!  All of the other team members booed and laughed at her.  She had missed the winning basket, and now she would pay.Carrollton, Texas is a very nice place you know.  Many things can happen there such as births, fairs, and deaths.  As you may know everyone is born and everyone dies too!  This is a story about a girl named Kareen.  Kareen lived of course in Carrollton, Texas where many things have been happening.  One day on a Saturday afternoon her grandfather had started to have chest pains.  His name was Ryan.  Ryan thought nothing of the odd chest pains that day.  These pains continued the next day too until finally his wife Katherine decided to take him to the hospital.  By the time that Katherine had called someone to take him to the hospital he was in really bad shape.  The doctors ran many tests on Ryan, and within a couple of hours they discovered that he had a type of cancer, and some kind of disease!  There was only a fifty-fifty chance that he would actually live to see another day.  On Father\'s Day of 1996 Mister Ryan Fallacaro died of drowning in his own body fluids.  Kareen didn\'t know what to think, her only grandpa had died before her very eyes on Father\'s Day!  Yet today his present still neatly wrapped sitting in the house of Kareen.  That present was never opened, and will never be opened.  Although Kareen misses her grandpa she knows he is safe up in heaven with our Lord.',3,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.35,0,0,0,0,2.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.7,Female51
'Yesterday I woke up and got ready for school. Went to Adamson High School to wait for my bus, got on the D176 and got to school. As I was coming to school I very carefully admired the sky. When I got to school I went to the rest room and try to fix my hair. Then I went to the cafeteria to eat breakfast. I got there a little later than usual so I only ate a doughnut, juice, and milk, because that was all they had. Then I put my tray up and went to buy a manila envelope. I needed for computer applications class. Then I want to my first period class which was agriscience. This week and last week we were working on our mums, so we finished that. After we finished we had a break. There was only fifteen minutes of class left so the teacher gave them all to us. We bought lots of stuff that they were selling, but I only bought a bag of Famous Amos cookies. My classmate offered me chips chili cheese fritos of barbecue not sure. In return I gave her some of my cookies. Bell rung so I started to my second period class computer applications. We were working on a hard copy assignment for a week now and yesterday was the day to finish it. I did not do mine because I did not have my disk full yesterday and also because somebody else was at the computer I was assigned to.To tell you the truth I don\'t really know. But I think what I usually do. See there is this thing that happens when I plan. I never have time to do what is planned. Usually I just go to my sixth period class and do my work. I try to do my best and well that\'s it. Then I go to my seventh period class which is World Geography. I just listen to the teacher and do my work. Then after an hour of in class I go to lunch thirty minutes and come back to class for thirty minutes,. then I go to eighth period and stay there and do what I\'m told. The bell rings and I go home. Only one different thing is happening today. That is, that I\'m going to the doctors. But that is all. After I come to the doctors I\'ll eat and do my homework. After my homework I\'ll do my chores. Then I\'ll just read and do stuff. I\'m not sure. But oh well. I\'ll probably just hang out and chill. Oh probably I will give my rabbit a bath and give him a manicure because he needs it.',3,-3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.33,0,0,0,2.16,4.33,0,0,0,4.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'\tThe second most upsetting has happened recently.  We went over to my mom\'s friend\'s house for dinner.  They have two kids one two year old (Sara), one eight year old boy (Joe), and another boy which is nine (Josh).  Before dinner we were riding scooters, (these were the kind you peddle with your foot.)  The boys had a ramp for their scooters.  There were two scooters.  My mom came out to get us and she found out I was afraid to go off the ramp.  She said it didn\'t look that hard so she was going to do it.  She got on the scooter but she wouldn\'t listen to us and did it anyway.  We told her she has to be going fast so the scooter wouldn\'t flip. She wasn\'t going fast enough and landed flat on her face.  When we saw her laying on the ground she wasn\'t moving and it looked like she was dead.  We ran over there and we saw her face in a puddle of blood.  And her barely breathing.  She said it knocked the wind out of her terribly bad.  She also had cut her chin open half an inch deep, skinned her knuckles, and had a huge circular bruise on her left leg.  We took her to the nearest hospital and she said she would be OK.  So we all went to Wal- Mart for an hour to buy groceries and when we got back there were still six more people in front of her on the emergency list.  They went inside and checked out and we went home and mom drove herself to a different hospital and didn\'t get home until four o\'clock in the morning.\tThe most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was when my aunt died. Her name was Aunt Linda to me, and she was my favorite aunt.  She died when she was thirty two.  She died lying in her own bed.  She died of lung cancer.  She said that when she was dying she didn\'t want to be put on any machine or anything because she would just be suffering.  Aunt Linda also had two kids, one is twelve year old boy the other is an eight year old girl.  Living in one house before Aunt Linda died was her, her two kids, and her mom and step dad moved into help take care of her.  At her funeral my eight year old cousin (her daughter) had to be taken home because she couldn\'t even think about not ever seeing her mom ever again.  She was crying her eyes out.  My twelve year old cousin (her son) and I were also devastated we couldn\'t even go look at her.\tWe went in the room at the funeral home when they had the ceremony. Approximately three different people talked for a long time.  After the ceremony everyone walked by her coffin and kissed her, told her they loved her, or cried.  After everyone was out of the funeral home they closed the lid to her coffin and took her outside into the hertz.  There was a graveyard right across the street so we walked over.  After they got her and her coffin up to the platform they rolled her down this little pathway to her grave.  They lowered her down into the hole and we said our last good bye.  I believe that she went to heaven and still watches over me, my mom, my sister, and all of my other family members.  I still love her and I know she will always love me. After everything was over and everyone was gone my eight year old cousin came and put her favorite necklace over the white cross my grandfather had made out of wood.  Every holiday we put different stuff on her grave.  In January 96 we went to put some flowers on her grave and we didn\'t see my cousin\'s necklace.  When she found out it had been stolen along with the white cross she was heart broken.  Because her mom gave her that necklace.',4,-5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.23,0,0,2.89,0,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,5.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.69,0,0,5.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.34,Female51
'\tAbout a month ago I had a bad experience with my friends at school.  I was having a good day until recess.  One of my friends was told that I said something bad about them.  The person who told her that made her think that I really said it.  I didn\'t know what was going on because I was walking and talking with another friend.  I don\'t know why she said that I was saying bad things about my friend but I wasn\'t.  The friend that was told that got some other girls and started ganging up on me.  When they were cutting me down I felt really sad because I thought they had just turned against me for some reason.  I asked them why and they said because I called her a name.  I said I truly didn\'t and they told me who said I did call her names.  When I found out who lied about me I felt really mad and sad. I felt mad because I didn\'t like being lied about and I was sad because it was one of my very good friends who did this to me.\tAfter that the teacher came over to see what all the yelling was about.  She asked why all the people were there when it wasn\'t their problem.  She told them to leave and me and my friend to stay.  We talked about it and said that Kelly said I called her a bad name.  The teacher asked me if I had said anything about her and I said, \"No, I was talking with Amber and then all these girls came over and started cutting me down.  I asked them why and they said because Kelly said I called her a bad name.\"  The teacher asked my friend why she didn\'t come and have proof that I said it.  She said, \"I was just so mad I wanted to get revenge on her.\"  The teacher said, \"Well now that you figured out that she didn\'t say anything about you, you have mad her suffer for no reason at all.\"  She then blew the whistle and everybody stopped playing and lined up behind her.  I felt really bad the rest of the day.  I cried the whole night that night.\tI will start where I left off.  I left off yesterday on how I cried all night.  The next morning when I was back at school I was afraid of what would be said that day.  After all that went on the day I wouldn\'t be surprised if the whole school knew about it.  Well, maybe I\'m exaggerating a little but to my surprise my whole class didn\'t know about it.  To my relief the subject wasn\'t brought up for the whole day (it still hasn\'t been.)  At the end of the day I had a pile of sorry letters in my locker, and they said that they were sorry for accusing me of saying things I really didn\'t say.  we have become better friends from this experience because we now know what to believe or not to believe about each other. It makes me feel better to know that my friends really care now and they know I wouldn\'t do anything like that to them ever.  But it makes me sad sometimes to think that they believed that about me.  Bye!

'Mary was always very upset, nervous, and scared around Jason, but she tried not to show it.  She never really wanted to go over to Jason\'s house, but she would always just follow the crowd or her older sister.  Her older sister normally laughed when Jason did this to her and that made Mary feel even worse.  All of her friends would also laugh and that didn\'t help any.  She would try to ignore then but she never could.  every once in a while Kayla would stick up for Mary and tell Jason that it wasn\'t funny and that made Mary feel appreciated and liked.  She always thought of her older sister as brave and powerful and that she could do anything, but she would never tell anybody this.  So when Kayla laughed you could probably see almost how badly this hurt Mary.  She really looked up to Kayla and loved her.  She wanted to do whatever Kayla was doing and nothing else.  She wanted to be her sister.  Jason would sometimes let Kayla and Mary\'s younger sister in and say that his mom only said two people were allowed in.  Mary knew that this wasn\'t true because he would let RJ and BJ in after awhile.  Kayla never really told Jason to let Mary in she would just let him pester her and then when she would go home crying Kayla would normally just watch.  Kayla could have told Jason to let Mary in because Kayla was really strong and a big tomboy.  Every guy on the block was scared of her.  She was really domineering.  This was another reason why Mary looked up to Kayla, because.After these incidents Mary was very upset and felt very bad.  She didn\'t know why Jason was mean to her but she wanted to know.  This happened to her all the times.  Sometimes Jason would invite her sisters in and say that his mom said that there were no Mary\'s allowed in his house.  Other times he would just pick on Mary and call her names and punch her in the arm.  Mary was very confused.  This happened to her for years, but she would always go back over to his house with all her friends no matter what.  He scared her so much that after a while when she would go in his room she wouldn\'t even sit down she would stand the whole time or sit really close to the door.  All this happening really made Mary feel bad she would rarely ever do inside her house and cry because she didn\'t want her parents to know.  Mary would either sit outside tin the front or go in the garage or the backyard and cry.  Mary really felt embarrassed when she would go home crying, even though it happened a lot, and she didn\'t want to tell her parents because she didn\'t want her sisters to be mad at her.  Especially Kayla her older sister.  Mary hated for anyone to be mad at her .  She wants to be liked.  Mary grew up with only guys.  Her and her sisters were the only girls on the block.  Jason, Kayla, RJ were the oldest and Mary, BJ and her younger sister were the youngest.  BJ and her younger sister always hung out together.  The older ones also hung out together.  Mary wanted to hang out with the older kids because she adored her older sister.   Kayla was like Mary\'s idol.There were three sisters their names were Kayla, Mary, and Julie.  Kayla was the oldest of the three girls and Julie was the youngest.  They lived on a street with only boys.  One of the boys whose name was Jason was always really mean to the middle child, Mary.  He would never let Mary do anything with the group.  Mary\'s sisters never did anything about this.  Jason would invite everyone over to his house.  They would go back to his room.  Mary was a what most people would call a fraidy cat or a chicken.  She was afraid of the dark and was scared of scary movies especially Freddy Krueger.  Jason loved Freddy Krueger and had the doll.  When he would invite everyone in he would take them all back to his room and they would play video games or board games or something like that.  Then if they were all in his room he would turn off the lights and Mary would get really scared and start to yell.  Then he would turn the lights back on but he would have his Freddy doll out and would start to make it talk by pulling the cord on the back.  Mary would always run out of the room crying and screaming while everyone else was laughing at her.  She would run home in the dark normally and go inside to her room.  This would always happen to her, but because her sisters and her friends.

'One cloudy snowing day, a girl named Sarah, her brother Mike, and her sister decided to go sledding.  The older brother Mike was fourteen, the older sister Roxanne was twelve, and Sarah was only nine.  She was the youngest out of the three.  The three of them put their warm clothes out, got their sleds, and headed out.  When they got to the place they wanted to sled, Roxanne and Mike started running toward a hill.  Sarah said \"Wait for me!\"  Roxanne and Mike called out \"Look at us!\"  We are standing on ice.  Sarah yelled cool and got her sled and ran to the top of the hill, where she saw her brother and sister at the bottom.  She called \"Here I come.\"  Roxanne and Mike were standing on the bottom of the hill.  They said \"Look at us Sarah, we are standing on ice.\"  Roxanne and Mike were really just standing on snow that looked like ice.  Sarah said \"I\'m coming down the hill!\"  \"No\" yelled Roxanne and Mike, but it was too late.  Sarah had gone down the hill.  She didn\'t know that there was a lake right down by the bottom of the hill!  Sarah couldn\'t stop she went as fast as possible with tat sled.  She went flying down the hill, and straight into the lake.  Roxanne and Mike were standing on the ledge right near the bottom of the lake.  They had just walked down the icy hill.  Sarah was scared to death.  She was screaming \"help, help!\"  Ice surrounded her.  She tried to grab a hold of the ledge of the hill, but it was too icy that her hands slipped every time.  She was going to drown.  Mike said here, grab onto my hand.

I always wonder am I still her best friend also.  I also feel no one like me.  Sometimes she tells me she needs to talk to her other friend privately.  She used to say that to me.

She wasn\'t crying, but deep down inside of her she wanted to.Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Jessica she had a dog named Snoopy she liked the dog at the beginning but then the dog started to get boring one time Jessica went to her friend\'s house she just bought new crayons Snoopy ran over took a crayon and bit it but he was just playing but he accidentally broke it Jessica was so mad she hated that dog she never knew that she really loved him until he was gone.

'One day my grandma was upset about something when I got home from the Gap store.  I thought she was going to cry.  She told my mom that my aunt- in- law had stomach cancer and that she just called from the hospital in Maryland.  My aunt- in- law was one of my aunt\'s that I didn\'t get to see that much.  Her son though was my cousin who taught me a lot of things.  My grandma also said that my aunt- in- law\'s husband is coming to Texas to find a job.  My uncle that is coming over to Texas is mentally ill.  So my other aunt Heddy Solis came over and said that my uncle can spend the night at her house since her daughter is in Austin.  My mom was worried that my uncle might do something to my grandma and grandpa since my uncle is mentally ill.  She said asked my other uncle if he can install a peep hole.  He said sure.  My mom said my uncle who is ill will come over on Saturday and today is Friday!  I was scared of that uncle since I was four or three years old.One good bye.  One day a girl named Anne rode on a horse\'s back for the first time in Wyoming.  She thought it was so fun.  Her horse\'s name was Slim, he was brown and rode like the wind.  She loved him so much she thought she\'d never depart from him.  She went on the mountains with him and he never let her ball.  Then she had to go back to Texas.  She missed him so much.  She loved him so much.  Finally this was it good-bye she wondered if she\'ll ever see him again.  Two good-bye.  Anne went back home and found her bird dead.  She ran to her room and cried.  She had that bird for five years.  She always talked to him when she was down.  Now how could this happen.  She should have been there for him.  She loved him like chocolate.  She\'d do anything to get him back to life even if it means no new clothes or phone.  How could this happen to me she said good-bye horse and bird.My mom was scared because my uncle is mentally ill.  So she\'s started crying and I started crying because he might do something to my grandma and grandpa.  On Saturday he was there and was fine and on Sunday he was fine and on Sunday and on Monday he was fine.  On Tuesday he heard his wife was going to have a major surgery.  So he left and I haven\'t heard from them since then.  The end.  The other story (based on me).  Once there was a frog who had a problem in.  It all started when the frog got a new dog.  Her grandma and grandpa like it at first but till she did her business in the house.  Oh! No!  The frog cried.  The next day the little frog went to school.  When she came home her grandma was crying.  The frog asked why and she said your grandpa has been cleaning the poop and I pity him.  He said he will die if does this everyday.  So she said they\'ll go back to the Philippines.  The baby frog doesn\'t know what to do.  She told her mom.  Her mom said we will put newspaper in the laundry room.

'\t1  When I was about 4 years old my grandma died of lung cancer.  She had smoked.  A couple years later my grandpa died.  He died of some kind of cancer.  We think he died of second hand smoke.  I hope I never die of smoking because I will never smoke.  I am going to a public school next year and I am kind of afraid.  What kind of people will be there?  Will people do drugs there?  I hope not.  Sometimes when people die I try to imagine what it is like after you die. What if you weren\'t a Christian and you go to the devil?  I\'m a Christian but something tells me I could be a better one.  Maybe I could tell people about what Jesus did.  I have a friend who is not a Christina and I don\'t want her to go way down there.  2  Sometimes I think about the time.  Right this very second is the only time on November 6, 1996.  There will never be another one.  When I get older I don\'t want to be old.  I want to stay young.  Just like Peter Pan.  If there was a never, never land I would be there right now.  Wait, Heaven is like never land your soul is changed when you die.  And you go up to heaven for eternal life.  Have you ever heard the joke about heaven being really wonderful that the pavement is gold?  We have natural resources down here and that is how1  One of my upsetting things was on my 9th birthday.  For my birthday I had gotten some pet mice.  When we came home we found them dead.  The cats had thrown Minnie Mouse around and Mickey Mouse was missing.  I was really angry at my cats.  But I still loved them. After that horrible experience I hardly played with my cats again.  2  When I was in 1st grade I was new to this school.  I didn\'t have any friends.  I spent my whole recess sitting by myself.  There was this one girl in my class a year older than me and she was mean.  Everyone else thought she was so cool.  Sometimes I cried when things were really tough.  I just wished I was older, pretty and popular. Sometimes I still do.  The only time I can get people\'s attention is when\tOnce I had a dream that my mom, sister and me were at an airport.  We were eating donuts at a counter and drinking something.  Then my mom and sister went through the tunnel to get on the plane. I tried to catch up with them but I couldn\'t walk.  Suddenly someone kidnapped me.  I woke up.  I would like to know what this dream means.  It was a very upsetting dream.  It was like I was alone in the world.  I know my parents won\'t abandon me.  But what if they die while I am still young?  What if someone abducts me?  I hope nothing like that will ever happen to me.  My worst fears on earth is being kidnapped.  When I get scared I go really numb. If I go really numb than I can\'t scream for help.  And if I can\'t scream for help then I could be killed.  If I was killed then I won\'t be able to grow up and become a Broadway star or a movie star.  I wouldn\'t make a difference in the world.  Maybe I could be a doctor.  I hope I wouldn\'t get AIDS.  People die from AIDS and I don\'t want to die',4,-5,0,1,5,0,3.29,0,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.29,0,0,0,6.58,0,0,0,6.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,16.44,0,13.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.24,0,0,6.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.29,14.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'\tYesterday morning I got up at about 6:45am, I had to quick take a shower and get out I got out of the shower at 7:15am.  My mom forgot she had a meeting so I didn\'t have time to eat breakfast or do my hair.  We drove to school, we had to get there early for my mom\'s meeting so we had to go to ESS.  15 minutes later we went up to our classrooms and had English, Literature, Vocabulary, History and Composition for 3 hours.  Then we had Spanish with Senora Gonzales, and did Reading.  Next was Creative writing it was my elective, in creative writing we wrote about tragedy.  Advisory was next so we went to Mrs Patterson\'s room, and had a work time.  For lunch I had green beans, mash potatoes and gravy and sausage, it was great.  PE is after lunch and yesterday we had to run a challenge course.  Megan and Chelsea had asthma attacks and had to go to the nurse.  We had Science, Math and Faith next.  But before we started Math Miss Helton came from college to share to us about her special project.\tRight now I plan to finish this paper, then I\'m hopefully going to have no homework in math, science, or faith.  After school I had planned on playing the championship game but it was postponed.  So when I get home I am going to finish my homework.  Then probably play with Nicole.  Nicole is a good friend of mine, she is a grade older 7th than me and goes to Hedrick Middle School.  We will probably play basketball, because she is going to try out again tomorrow. (I hope she make the team.)  she will.  After that I will come home and do some research on my research project. And maybe watch TV.  My dad would get home and then we would have dinner.  Usually after dinner we play a game read, and sometimes I talk on the phone.  8:30pm is bedtime but before we have that we will do devotions.  Then I will get a good book and read in bed.  Shortly after that I will read in bed but fall asleep after a little while.  Then I wake up to another day.  The end.  Right now I plan to finish this paper.  Then have no homework in math science or religion.  I was going to play soccer but it was postponed because of the rain.  So I\'ll go home do my homework.  Then I will play with my good friend Nicole.  She is 7th grade at Hedrick Middle School in Lewisville Texas.\tToday I woke up and did not go back to sleep, but I still did not get out of bed.  I heard my brother coming and pretended to be asleep. But when my eyes were closed he put a dripping wet wash cloth on my face and that sure did get my attention.  I got out of bed got dressed and did my hair I was already running late so I fixed myself some breakfast and took it to the car and ate it on the ride.  At school we had to go to Mrs Lindstrom\'s class first and did some work and then went to chapel.  Chapel was fun we learned about good and bad attitudes, Mr Dittmer had some people acted out good and bad attitudes, Jennie was the I don\'t care attitude she was good.  We went back to Mrs Lindsrtoms class did a lot of work till eleven and then we had our electives.  Creative writing is mine today.  We looked over our stories and then got to play with puzzles.  In advisory we got to watch a movie called Veggie Tails.  It was about talking and singing bible vegetables.  We had lunch and I had to sit with the boys.  PE was great but we did a lot of running.  Next we went to Mr Thorman\'s classroom but before we did any work we had to do this paper.  I think all this writing is fun though.

'The most upsetting experience that I have is what my parents fusses at me for no reason. For example if my sister tells them that I did something to her I get in trouble. But she doesn\'t tell everything that she does. I get so mad I just want to hit her but I don\'t Sometimes my parents and sister gets on my nerves so much. I get where I can\'t stand them. Another thing that I don\'t tell people is when my mother and father and father don\'t trust me. For instance, they won\'t let me go anywhere by myself. Like if my cousin call and asks me do I want go somewhere with him they tell me no. Also if Ii just want to go up the street and back they won\'t even let me go. Sometimes I feel like I just want to run away, or cry.One of the most upsetting things that happens to me is when my mother and father fusses at me for things that I do not do. For instance, when my sisters does things to me and gets away with it. Also when I ask can I go somewhere with my friends they tell me no, or if my cousin ask me can I go to the movies, or skating ring him, my parents say no. Another thing, they would not let me go anywhere by myself, they always have to go with me. For example, the fair. I want to go to the fair with my friend who lives up the street from me and my cousin, and my other friend. They have to go with me. My mother and father are over protective.Another upsetting experience that I have is when my mother and father fusses at me, for things that happened a long time ago. Like of my little sister, tells them something, they believe it and fusses at me. Al so, when I get a punishment for dumb things. For example, if I do not do what I am supposed to do like clean up. Like if I call someone and they star sixty nine me back, or if they have caller id and call me back. I will get a punishment or fussed at for that.',2,-4,0.5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.58,0,0,0,0,7.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.5,0,0,7.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'\tI guess that I try too hard to be friends with the popular girls and should let them come to me.  But it is so upsetting that they say I am their friends and don\'t tell me stuff that the other girls know and their friends too.  Well I\'ll try my best.  Until next time, Katy.  Dear Journal, November 15, 1996  It is getting better but they just don\'t come to me.  The really big thing is that at PE we get to pick partners sometimes and no one what one but the rest of the girls are nice too.  It is like a big group of girls that is cool and there is not really a leader all the time because things change like one is the most popular at one time and so on, I want to be one of their close friends and get to know things and I choose the popular girls because at my old school I was one of the most popular girls.  Dear journal, summer.  Everything is working out a little and I\'m friends with them but not all the way.  My friends come over to my house (well they always did) but a lot now because it is like where you\'re alone with people\tThe most upsetting thing that happened to be was at school last year in fourth grade.  It was my first year at a new school and the popular girls sort of laughed at me when I said something wrong or weird.  Story Dear Journal August 13, 1995.  I got you today so I could write in about school and my thoughts.  My name is Katy and it is the first day at a new school and I\'m in fourth grade.  The girls there seem pretty nice and I want to be their friends.  Sincerely, Katy.  Dear Journal September 21, 1996.  I\'m having a problem making friends with the popular girls because they have been there a long time.  But there is one girl who is really nice and wants to be friends with everybody.  Her name is Ashley and I really like her and she is my friend. The other girls are my friends or at least they say I am.  The problem is that I feel like they leave me out and don\'t want to spread the gossip to me.  For example like I say what is it and they say never mind or its nothing, but it is something or they wouldn\'t be something to talk about.  Well I\'ll talk to you later.  Katy.  Dear Journal, November 2, 1996\t A whole different thing I don\'t know where I exactly left off but here it goes.  One of the most dreadful thing that happened to me and the most boring.  This summer I have to go to Yellowstone National Park.  I know what you\'re thinking that it will be a great experience, yes yes.  Well I love TV and I watch it a lot.  It is entertaining to me.  The thing is, is that my family and I are driving in a motor home all around the park and there is no TV.  We aren\'t driving from Texas to Wyoming, we are flying to Utah and renting a motor home then drive to Yellowstone.  It is completely boring to drive for hours and hours in a car with nothing to do.  When we were in the park all we saw was trees, dead ones too, animals stuff like that. Oh I forgot to mention that there is another family we know that came with us except in their truck and trailer.  We all stopped at places that had natural stuff.',3,-4,0,2,1,0,3.24,0,0,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,1.62,0,0,0,0,6.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.34,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'Well last time that I wrote I was telling you about an ex-boyfriend of mine. I was explaining how we got in an argument. Then we started screaming and saying a lot of mean things. When I told him to shut up he turned around and slapped me. I fell to on the floor and was crying and hurt. I had never been hit by a guy. I walked out of his house and walked home.  Later that night he went to my house and apologized and said that he did not mean it. That he was just mad. I did not want to fight so I told him I was okay and gave him a hug. I also told him to go home. Since that night I have hardly seen him. He bugs me now and then but I tell him I am not interested. That was my first and last time I will get hit by a guy. He hurt me so much thorough the inside and out. But I am glad I broke up with him. I just sorry I did not listen to my brother. Now when I see that a guy is starting to act a little too jealous I end it right then and there. I still like my ex a lot but I do not want to go through that again.One of the most upsetting things that has happened to me is that I was standing up in a fifteen. We were just about to finish when the heel of my shoe slipped on a napkin and fell. It turned out that I broke my ankle. Well, actually just fractured it. But it hurt alot. They had to pick me up and carry me to a seat. I think a girl that did not like me put it there. I was hurt, mad, and embarrassed all at the same time. I was hurt because of what she did, and because of my ankle. I was mad because she did it at the worst time. If she hated me that much why didn\'t she tell me in my face. And I knew it was that girl because she was laughing at me. I was also embarrassed because everyone was there. I felt sorry for my friend because fifteenth dance was ruined.Another upsetting experience was when I was talking to this guy and it turned out to be my brothers friend. Well that didn\'t stop me from talking to him even though my brother told me stuff about him. I really liked and wanted to go with him. Well after a while we started going together. It was all right at first but then he started getting bossy, possessive, and jealous. I still liked him a lot so I stayed with me. One day after ten months of going out we were at his house. Then one of my friends paged me. He thought it was another guy. We started to argue about it. So I called my friend and let him talk to her,  but he still didn\'t believe me. We started yelling and he slapped me so hard that I started to bleed from my mouth.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.58,0,0,3.72,7.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.86,0,0,0,0,26.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.43,0,31.61,0,0,3.72,0,0,0,0,0,7.43,0,0,0,5.58,0,11.15,5.58,0,0,7.43,0,9.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.72,Female51

'I left off when I was counting my money. While doing so I was bending over my bed. Ken and Michael was in the living room talking about something I couldn\'t really hear what they were saying. While I was over my bed counting my money Ken came behind me and hugged me from behind and touching up around my chest area. At the time I thought he was just messing with me as always. Then he said Michael called me a name so I ran in the living room and was hitting him. Once again I thought they were just messing with me as always. While I was hitting Michael he picked me up and sat him on his lap where his penis was located. Ken then started to make the couch move up and down with his hand. They were asking me questions that I did not really understand. I remember one questions that they asked me and it was Have you ever been fingered. I did not know what it meant and I said I did not know. Then they both started laughing. After that Michael laid me down on the couch and started trying to take off my jeans but he seen my mother driving up so he stopped and threatened  to kill me and my mother if I told anymore. At that moment I was scared and felt like I did something wrong that is why I never told my mother. All that summer so I would not have to stay home I went to go stay with Aunt out of town. The only person I ever told was my sister and cousin.Well I really did not like it when they were doing me like that. I felt like a toy being passed around. I was glad when  my mother came home because I felt she could protect me from Ken and Michael. After that all of us went to track practice and of course I was with a lot of boys because my sister was gone. After practice my mother\'s boyfriend Daryll made me and his younger nephew run around the blocks but before we started Daryll hit me on my butt and told us to go. Like I said before I never told anyone this. We moved away from Daryll because my sister told my mother that he was feeling on her. But at that time my sister did not know what happened to me. I did not tell anyone until about two years ago and my mother still does not know. And I do not plan on telling her because I am scared she will be mad at me because I did not tell her when it first happened. That was my most upsetting time in my life so far. The most upsetting thing that happened to me was when my mother was seeing a man named Daryll. They had been seeing each other for quite a wile before he moved in. I was around ten at the time. I was going to school done the street. When school was out he left his two nephews stay with me, my mother, and my sister. They stayed with us all summer. After a while Michael and Ken started blending in with the family. I mean we was acting like brothers and sisters fighting all the time. One night my Mama and Daryll had left me there with Michael and Ken. My sister was over a friends house. To this very day I  wish I could have went over a friends house that night. Everything was going fine just like normal. We was playing video games and listening to the radio. Well, while I was playing video games Ken and Michael started whispering where I could not hear them. But I really was not paying much attention because I was so occupied with my video games. So I stopped playing and turned the television off and went into my room and started counting my money.',3,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.97,0,0,0,5.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.97,0,8.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.88,0,0,2.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.97,Female51

'Yesterday I wrote about the two most upsetting experiences.  So I guess today I will go on to one less upsetting experience.  It was probably when had to leave all my friends from Dan Long to come to Prince of Peace.  I hated it.  But all my friends kept calling me.  At first I was grounded so I couldn\'t call them back but after I was off I talked to them all the time.  I live near Long and a lot of my friends from Long. So they come over to my house almost every night and vice versa.  Also I made some friends at Prince of Peace that are good ones.  So after I got over the fact that I was not going back to Long.  It became a lot easier for me to get use to Prince of Peace.  It was a difficult experience and very, very, very different but I learned that life is full of different experiences some could be for the worse and some for the better but it is always good to try new things.  To me it teaches you who you really are and if you don\'t like who you are or you\'re not happy trying new things will help you figure it out and or change you for the better.  So be prepared for anything and always remember to have no fear!The most upsetting, worst thing was when one morning me and my mom got into a fight and said some really bad things to each other.  Without saying a nice good-bye we left the house with anger.  She dropped me off at school and I got out and slammed the door. We didn\'t even say bye or I love you nothing.  Later that day my grandma picked me up and told me my mom got in a car accident.  Bad one when she came home that night we both cried and I told her I was sorry and I loved her so much.  Now we never leave anywhere without saying I love you first because you never are going to know when the person you love the most will never be with you again.  Also it\'s good to say I love you all the time especially before you go somewhere because if not you may never get to it to that person again.  The second most upsetting thing to me was probably when I lived in Oklahoma and we had to move. I do like Dallas and all but I had to leave and most of all my grandparents who lived down the street.  I practically grew up with them all my life.  And my mom and her don\'t communicate very much. So I didn\'t get to say good-bye in person, on my mom\'s car phone.  But I did and do see her a lot and talk to almost everyday.I really can\'t think of another upsetting experience off the top of my head.  But when I got to Prince of Peace everyone gossiped.  At Long if I had a problem with someone I went up to them here everyone is like little children and that\'s how little stupid fights get started.  Story number two.  This is like something that causes fights with me and my mom.  When she doesn\'t trust me.  Right now my mom is out of town so at least I get a break with fight with her.  But it is caused so much problems, our fighting, that I was going to leave when I\'m fifteen and stay with my best friend or live with my grandparents.  but lately we\'ve both been trying really hard and I think it is going to work.  See the reason all this started is at first she thought I was in a gang. See I had a lot of Hispanic friends and black but I had white to seventh and eighth.  I was a cheerleader and all but I think my mom has a racial problem.  I think of people the same all one color inside.  And we are all equal no matter if you\'re green, purple, orange, yellow, black, brown, or white.  We are all the same on the inside and in God\'s eyes.  That is all that should matter.

'Once there was this girl her name was Esmiralda. She always felt bad when she would see homeless people in the street or when she would see someone who did not have alot of money and was badly dressed or hungry. One day she was with her mom and they stopped at an ATM machine. She got out of the car because her mom wanted her to get money from the machine. When she was going up to the ATM machine there was this black lady sitting on the steps. She was poorly dressed and her hair was all messed up. The lady stopped her and said that she just needed ten dollars so that her and her daughter could stay at a Salvation Army. Esmiralda did not know what to say so she just said okay, hold on. then she went to the ATM to get the money. She did not know what to do so she thought that she would just the lady ten dollars from what her mom told her to get and she would tell her mom she would pay her back as soon as she got home. So as she came back down the stairs the lady just looked at her. She thought her mom would let her give her ten dollars. Then her mom yelled at her to get in the car. She walked up to the window and told her mom could she give that lady ten dollars to stay at the Salvation Army. Then mom said no to get in the car. She did not want to look back at that lady so she just walked around the car. After she got the money for her mom she walked to the car to tell her mom what the lady had told her. Her mom said no to get in the car and she told her mom she would pay her back but her mom got mad and said to get in the car now. She was ashamed and felt really bad for the women so she didn\'t want to turn around and look back at her. As she was walking around the car the lady well out at her and said you think you are too good to help a poor lady out. And she yelled that Esmeralda was stingy and greedy. Her eyes started to water as she got back in the car. She felt so bad and she was mad at her mom for not letting her give the women the money. She was beginning to cry but she didn\'t want her mom to know she was upset. The car was so quiet and she was trying to hold back the sobs. Everytime she would think of that lady it would make her cry even harder because she couldn\'t believe that someone could be so bad off. Then her mom said what\'s wrong and it made her cry even more but she didn\'t want to tell her mom why she was upset. Then her mom asked her if she was upset about that lady. And she said yes. Her explained to her that the lady probably didn\'t need the money because the salvation Army doesn\'t charge for you to stay there. She told her that she was just trying to get money. Then Esmeralda felt a little better. But whenever she sees a homeless person or kids that don\'t have shoes or something they need she gets really upset.Another very upsetting thing that has happened to me was when I was about seven or eight. My cousin was having a sleep over for her fourteenth or fifteenth birthday. Well she just invited me because I was little and I wanted to come. Then my aunt had to go pick up my uncle and my cousin which was the only boy there went with her so it was just me, my cousin and her girlfriends at the house. They all went into my cousin\'s room and I stayed in the living room playing a game. Then I guess they were talking about this girl Rosemary because she started crying and went walking home. Then everyone came to the living room and were wondering why she left. We waited in the living room for her to come back. Then all of a sudden someone started beating on the door. It was Rosemary and she was crying and yelling for us to let her in. When we let her in she slammed the door and locked it up. She said some man was chasing her with a knife. We all got scared and turned the lights out and started to crawl to my cousin\'s room. I was so scared I couldn\'t move so I crawled under the dining room table and stayed there by myself. Then I guess he knocked on their window because I heard them scream. It was really dark under the table and I was so scared I couldn\'t move or talk. Then I guess with the knife the man started to make scratching noises on the window right next to where I was.

He loved that dog more than life itself!  As the years passed Joe became more and more attached to Daffy.  She was like the sister he never had.  Daffy got older every year.  But Joe still loved her.  When Daffy got so old she couldn\'t control her bladder she peed on everything.  Joe started to get angry at her.  When daffy peed he would get so mad he would send her outside and yell at her.  But deep down Joe still loved her more than ever.  One day Daffy go t really sick and they had to put her down.

He held her the whole way and in the  waiting room.  Joe was so sad. The doctor called them in and gave her the medicine.  Joe tried to leave but Daffy would not let go unless Joe stayed and  petted her.  So he did.  He cried so hard.  Joe never realized how much you love something and miss it till its gone!  The end.  Epilogue: What a sad story!  Joe\'s family ended up buying a new dog, same breed, exactly like Daffy.  Her name was Molly Bea.  A few years later, Joe\'s family was given another dog, same breed, named Shelby Lee.  Shelby is currently twelve weeks old and as cute as can be!I think the most upsetting thing that ever happened to me is when we moved.  I had lived at 4432 August street my whole life.  And then my parents decided to move to the lake.  So they put up a sign that read for sale!  At first I was happy.  I\'d always wanted to move.  Then when someone bought it, a week later, it sort of hit me.  Someone else was going to climb my tree, take a shower in my bathroom, have my room!  I was sickened at the thought I begged my mom to tell the lady it was not for sale, but she refused.  Then I went to dad.  He said the same thing.  I felt betrayed that my parents sold the house.  I felt angry at myself for wanting to move.  I felt resentful towards whoever bought it.  And most of all I felt sad.  I felt sad because I had lived there for thirteen years and now I had to pack up, leave, and never go there again.  I cried for a long long time.  I said I was going to chain myself to the wall.  I didn\'t.  I packed up, left and acted mature about it.  But deep down I felt like screaming and flailing out at someone.  I wanted to move everything back in or just not let the people have it.  To make it worse our new house wasn\'t finished being built so I had move into temporary housing!  That creamed the cake.  I was furious!  But I still didn\'t let it out.  I had to share a room with my brother.  I wasn\'t mad at that though.  That\'s fun.  I just wanted to shrivel up and be nonexistent during the move!  It\'s not like we moved states or anything but it was like we moved thousands and thousands of miles away.Jenny and Amanda had been best friends since the first grade.  Now it was the fifth grade and even better friends.  They shared secrets about things their diaries didn\'t even know.  Their friendship grew everyday more and more.  Jenny and Amanda were inseparable!  When they were together the whole world disappeared and it was just the two of them doing whatever.   One day Amanda called Jenny crying.  What is wrong asked Jenny.  My dad just told me that we were moving in December.  Jenny and Amanda cried for hours on the phone reminiscing all the great time they had spent together.  It was four months till Amanda and her family packed up and left.  They were moving to New Jersey!  From then on they mad every minute, second, count.  They went and did everything, everything together.  One night about four months later Amanda called Jenny and told her they were in the car on their way to New Jersey!  They talked, talked, and talked and cried and cried.  They planned visits, wrote letters, sent telegrams and cried.  Jenny felt that she didn\'t have another friend in the world.  She felt lonely!  She felt devastated, sad, mad, angry, scared, depressed all sorts of mixed emotions.  Years later they still keep in touch and are still really great friends!  The end!

I know we will be taking some notes in history probably the whole time but maybe talk about what we read the other night in the story Evangeline.  Then we will switch classes and I will carry all of my books and my tissues, water bottle and trash can that the nurse practically forces me to take to class and then Miss Severson will hand out our sheet of paper for memory or we will go up to her desk and say it to her and we will turn in our religion booklets and work on some religion work that we may have to do.

'\tAmy said, \"If you tell then you will be a tattletale.\"  Of course Shelvi did not want to be a tattletale so she did not tell but having made this decision Amy again started chanting her smurf song.  Again Shelvi came home crying and again her mother asked her what was wrong and she said, \"Like yesterday I was made fun of not by everybody but by one person Amy.\"  She went on to talk about Amy calling her a tattletale and her singing her smurf song.  Her mother replied, \"maybe you just need to be nice to her, why don\'t you call her and invite her to come play with you tomorrow after school.\"  Shelvi said, \"Okay, that sounds like fun.\"  So she called Amy and asked her and she said, \"No, why would I want to play with a smurf.\"  Then she hung up.  Then Shelvi started saying I am too small for everything and nobody likes me.  At school the next day she ignored Amy and when Shelvi was called smurf she pretended to not hear.  She did this day after day.\tIt was the first day of school and Shelvi came home crying she ran through the back door, ran to her room and cried and cried.  A few minutes later Shelvi\'s mom came in and said, \"Shelvi what is wrong, didn\'t you have a good day at school?\"  She replied, \"I hate school I am the smallest one there and everyone calls me a name.\"  Her mom said, \"Maybe just because you are new, don\'t worry things will get better.\"  Shelvi agreed but still knew things would not get better.  The next day Shelvi went to school but as soon as she walked in Amy began chanting smurf, smurf, she\'s a smurf.  Shelvi said, \"If you don\'t stop I\'ll tell on you.\"  Amy replied, \"Then you\'ll be a tattletale.\"  \tAt school the next day Shelvi saw Amy.  Amy said, \"I am sorry for yesterday and calling you a smurf I just thought that you were snobby because you were small but you are really nice even when I called you a smurf you did not cry.\"  Shelvi replied, \"Oh yes I did, I didn\'t cry at school but as soon as I got home I was bawling!\"  \"Well I\'m sorry I made you cry, but I hope we can be friends.\"  \"Sure!\"  The next day Amy was again invited over but this time she said, \"Sure I would love to come over and play!\"  So she came home with Shelvi and they had a great time.  They were around each other so much pretty soon they were best friends.  Their moms were amazed how worst enemies could get to be best friends in such a short period of time.  And so that is how Shelvi and Amy got to be best friends but that is not all they continued to be friends and every year Shelvi remembers that time.  Shelvi and Amy frequently have fights but they are usually not serious but all best friends have fights.

'\tI am going to continue the story I started yesterday, about the most upsetting thing.  It was about how I lost my bird Sunny.  Well here I go!  My mom said she would go out and look around the neighborhood for Sunny.  We couldn\'t find her.  I was very sad.  My mom said that I could get a new bird when we come back from our vacation.  I was happy that I could get a new bird, in all, but I still miss my bird Sunny.  So about a week when we came home from our vacation me and my mom went to a place called \"Kookaburough\".  It was a bird store.  I looked at many different birds until I found a beautiful green cheeked conor.  It is referred to as a miniature parrot.  They can talk, too.  I bought it that day.  There were a whole lot of things you had to do for it.  You had to clean out it\'s cage once a month, you have to clean out the bottom of his cage every week, (which is not hard), you have to boil it\'s food once a month, and give it to it everyday, and put vitamins in it\'s food.  But I loved it very much, so I made a commitment that I would take care of my bird. Now my bird is learning how to say \"pretty bird.\"  My dad said I have to sell my bird if I do not play with it in the morning and keep it quiet.  So I am going to do that.  I guess the story wasn\'t all that bad!\tA upsetting thing is when my cat Suzi ran away.  She was a calico. She had a green eye and a blue eye.  The reason she had different color eyes was because one day when we were gone, my cat was outside.  She got hit in the eye with a bicycle we think.  Because when came home her eye was bleeding.  My dad took her to the vet.  I was sad. She had a green eye now.  Let me get back to the subject on how I lost her.  She had been left outside with the gate open.  We went somewhere.  When we came back she was gone.  We looked everywhere, even in the gutters.  We couldn\'t find her.  She was our baby.  Another story is about my dog Carrie.  One day the lady that lived in front of us didn\'t want her dog anymore.  So we asked for it.  She gave it to us for free.  We didn\'t know why.  Carrie was a mix.  He was so cute.  He had a dark black nose and eyes.  He tore up everything we had. He kept biting me and my sister Jennifer.  So my dad had to take him to the vet.  And a boy there bought him.The most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was when my bird named Sunny flew away.  She was a gorgeous cockatoo!  She had a little mohawk on her head.  The story is, one day my mom got up early, so she took my bird outside so Sunny wouldn\'t wake anybody in our family up.  She sat in one of our chairs we have in the backyard, and my bird was on the ground on his or her cage.  I don\'t know if it was a boy or girl.  Then my mom went to get some coffee.  She always drinks coffee in the morning, because she is tired.  While she was getting her coffee, she heard a flap flap flap.  So she ran outside to see what happened.  My bird was gone.  It had flown over the fence.  He or She had her wings clipped.  The vet said it caught a wind.  My mom went out to look for it.  She couldn\'t find it.  I woke up about 30 minutes later.  I went into my parents room.  They were making lost bird signs.  I was crying when I found out.  So me and my dad went and put up the signs.  I was so mad at my mom.  It was her fault.  She said she was sorry, and I forgave her.  She went with me to look for Sunny.',4,-5,0.5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4,0,0,2.79,0,5.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.55,0,0,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.79,Female51

Especially sherbet and yogurt.  Now 6 and a half months later, all I miss is sherbet.  But I have tried malteds, rice dream, non dairy pudding, and coffee mate on my cereal!  Yuck!  That is what I say to that yuckiness.  Milk does your body good so I have to have 2 or more glasses of pulpy-calcium rich orange juice.  Calcium Flinstones vitamins, and spearmint, organic, gritty, calcium tablets!  Yuck!  If I could just have sherbet I would be in eternity forever.

At the beginning of school I made some new friends, and my best friend, and my new friends all got along so it was cool!  But when my best friend found out that I broke up with John she thought it was her turn to have him, but he didn\'t like her.  After Kassandra found out that John didn\'t like her she totally denied ever ever liking him, this made Mel and me mad because she liked him so much!

'I stole a pack of cigarettes from my uncle.  I went into the bathroom to try it not even lit.  I tried it and it looked very cool.  I thought so if I just smoke a few--it won\'t really, really hurt me?  The next day I tried it lit.  I was good!  Then I kept on smoking one after another.  I didn\'t thing about smoking can hurt me or I can get used to it.  I didn\'t\' think at all.  I was so stupid.  I still want to smoke though.  I want to smoke Capri or Misty.  I could just imagine myself at home alone, sitting on a recliner, watching television, smoking Capri cigarettes.  I like to smoke but I know it\'s stupid.  I still like to smoke even though I know the dangers.  I think smoking is so cool!  A lot of people do it so why can\'t I?  I liked smoking so I stole another pack.  I took them home and kept on smoking.  I decided it was bad for me so I got the last pack of cigarettes.The most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was smoking.  I feel so bad about it.  I know it\'s wrong, but now I\'m obsessed with it. I haven\'t told anyone except my best friends and my cousin who is like a sister to me.  Smoking scared me and now I feel filthy.  I hope it doesn\'t make me sick.  I don\'t feel good about this at all.  Sometimes I forget about it and be happy.  This is one thing in my life that\'s made me think and I kind of feel cool about it but I know it\'s not cool!  This is one thing serious because it\'s about drugs.  I quit about three or five months ago.  I now feel cleaner, worry free, happy, and smart.  I will never ever smoke again!  On a Saturday afternoon I had nothing to do so I looked in a magazine.  I saw a lot of cigarette ads.  It looked so cool but, I knew it was bad for me but I did it anyway.  My uncle smoked and I thought.I kept on smoking till I thought, I\'m doing the wrong thing!  So I went in my back yard and dug a hole.  I got the pack of cigarettes and put it in the hole.  I put the dirt on top of the pack of cigarettes.  They were gone forever.  I\'m very happy now.

'Well in my dreams I always dream of something bad like someone killing or kidnapping me but I don\'t know how to solve it or erase it out of my mind.  When I dream of something bad I always wake up crying and scared and afraid but sometimes I can solve it by not thinking of it or feeling something touching me or scaring me.  But this is what happened to me one time.  One day my grandma and me and my mom and my cousin went to the grocery store to buy some food and when we came back to drop off the food I was in the car with my cousin Jimmy and my grandma and my mom got down from the car and we were waiting and waiting until some ma with gold teeth jumped in the car and took us to his house and he said \"I just kidnapped you and am going to kill you\" because he had a gun in his hand and he also said \"follow me\" but I did not listen to him neither did my cousin Jimmy.  Jimmy was crying and crying until we saw an office to go find help.  Then the man and the woman took us and they saw a police and they tried to pull theme over but the police followed us and took us home and try to find my mom but they couldn\'t at all so they watched me and my cousin until my mom came home but my mom was so sad and crying a lot and she wouldn\'t stop not for one bit.  After three days, my mom was so happy and we lived happily ever after.One day me and my grandma were at the grocery store to buy some food for home when we came back from the grocery store we parked our car right outside the hose but then this man jumped in the car and took us to his house and to never come back but I saw this office right by a swimming pool but I got mad really mad because that man did not give us something to eat and that man was my uncle so I got frustrated really bad but I didn\'t bother because I was a little smart to know better than to be a fool at all things but I was still crying out loud I said I want my mom so he took me home.  The end.  When I get mad I get really mad so frustrated like you know how grownups get mad well like that okay.I feel weird when somebody calls me names or hurt my feelings that really hurts a lot really but I want to know how to solve the problem maybe by let\'s see maybe my ignoring them or not go by them but also when I drop something or hit any part of my body I start to get embarrassed and then everybody starts to laugh at me or play jokes on me but that really hurts my feelings and I get very mad when they do that.  I also get mad when my brother bothers me or doesn\'t let me eat at all and I feel like I want to hit him hard but I can\'t because he is my baby brother and I will never do that to him ever but he gets me so mad and angry but I try not to get mad but it just happens most of the time but I know I love him and care for him but I just get mad and frustrated but also at school no one likes to play with me like to being out or play games like tag.  I get so mad that my face turns purple at all times and I also cry a lot when somebody hurts my feelings sometimes in my dreams I dream about what gets me so mad.  To me I think it is the Devil.  I just hate to say that word but it gets me so mad that I want to kill him but I just can\'t.  I mean how can I it is so hard to find out how the Devil came to earth it is so hard to think of it really hard.  It also gets me mad when I think of bad things happening to my family.

'\tToday when I was at PE in the gym I was playing a game for the class period.  And I went to be in Miranda and Chelsea\'s group, but Chelsea said no and to go with someone else, but then I said no.  Then the game had started and I was in Chelsea\'s group so she got mad at me and I\'ve known Chelsea since second grade and now she tells secrets about me and leaves me behind and ignores me and she won\'t even give me chance to be her friend again.  So that made me feel that I don\'t belong at this school because nobody likes me and everyone gets mad at me for no reason.  Also everyone ignores me and makes fun of the way my hair looks, for what shows I watch like Baywatch, and the music I listen to like Mariah Carey.  I think that they need to accept me the way that I am.\tOne day me and my friend were at the library, the one in the school, and we were trying to find some books.  Then Brad saw a shark book and told us to come look at it so we did then Ryan and him were talking very loud and we told them to be quiet but they wouldn\'t.  So the librarian thought me and my friend were talking so she said that she was going to get into trouble and we were very upset and crying.  When we went past the kitchen my friend said she wanted to kill herself and started towards the kitchen to get a knife and I pulled her away and said no and that it was going to be all right.  So we went to our classroom and I told the teacher what happened and that it wasn\'t us that it was the boys.  So she said that I could go talk to the librarian about the situation. So I went to the library and explained to her and she understood.

'One day Brent\'s dad got a phone call.   It was Brent\'s grandma, she was crying very loud.  Brent could hear her over the phone.  Brent\'s dad was trying to calm her down.  He finally did, then he gave the phone to Brent.  Brent was scared, he didn\'t like his grandma\'s weak and upset voice.  He thought what happened to my mom?  He remember she had gone out of town to see her very sick brother, he had cancer.  Brent decided to talk, \"Hello\" he said.  \"Brent, this is Nana.\"  There was a long pause.  \"Brent, your uncle Al had to, he, he passed away this morning.\"  At this time Brent was relieved it wasn\'t his mom but deep down he was screaming with pain.  Then Brent realized what his grandma just said.  \"Dead,\" Brent asked frantically.  \"Yes, honey don\'t cry.  I don\'t want you to cry neither does your uncle Al.  Promise me you won\'t.\"  \"Okay,\"  Brent said very sadly.  But when he hung up the phone he couldn\'t keep that promise he ran outside into the yard and fell to the ground and cried and cried.  That night his dad, him, and his brother all went to Brent\'s grandma\'s house for the funeral.  Brent was so sad all the way there.  When they reached his Nana\'s there were many people at the house.  He went in and there were so many people.  He couldn\'t believe it his cousin was even there.  She lived in Maine.  There were so many relatives some even stayed for a week!  But his grandma took it real hard.  She just kept saying is name in her sleep \"Alejandro Al!  Come back!\"It was very upsetting to Brent he wasn\'t ever going to see his uncle again, but then he thought again, why did he have to die?  Then he realized he was going to see his uncle again, in heaven.  It was finally time for Brent to go home, he said his good-byes to all his family and best friends.  Then him, his dad, and his brother went home.  When they got home Brent had to go back to school.  He hadn\'t done any of his homework so that made even more upset.  He got Ds for all his homework, then all the other teachers heard from his homeroom teacher about his uncle.  They all decided to give him one hundred for everything he had done that week, that made him feel a lot better.  Brent still missed his uncle very much and he cried for about another two weeks.  Brent always admired his uncle for all of his hard work.  He always remembered how strict he was, and Brent never felt guilty when his uncle died, because he always told his uncle he loved him, and gave him hugs.  Brent, to this day still remembers what his uncle looked like, what he went through, and how he was such a good man.  Brent always wishes he could have his uncle back, but he can\'t.  Brent says he will always remember, love and honor his uncle for all his great deed, but Brent says he will remember, love, and honor his uncle for who he was, not just his hard work.  Brent knows his uncle will always be in his heart and they will soon meet again in heaven.She would yell it real loud \"Al, Alejandro come back!\"  But she was asleep.  Brent couldn\'t bear it so he called his best friend.  He was always there for Brent, even at 2 in the morning.  They talked for a while then they had to go.  Brent was still really upset.  He cried himself to sleep that night.  The next day all Brent\'s relatives left.  They were all in the kitchen saying good bye.  Brent\'s grandma was still upset.  She looked at her sister and said \"Don\'t ever say good-bye just shake hands and walk away.\"  Neither one could bear to do this action so they both started crying.  After everyone left, Brent\'s grandma to him, \"My mama told me that.\"  \"Told you what Nana?\"  \"She told me never to say good-bye.\"  \"Well, I still think you should always say good-bye.  You might never see that person again.\"  Brent replied, but deep down he know why his great grandma had said this,  He wished only if could had seen his uncle just one last time, not in the hospital.  Brent\'s mom wouldn\'t let him go to the funeral so Brent did not get that chance to see his uncle again, which made him very sad because Brent and his uncle were very close.  Brent went to a couple of functions with his cousin before he went home, but all he could think about was is uncle Al.  Everyone kept coming up to Brent and his cousin and giving them hugs and kept saying they were sorry.  But Brent thought why are they saying sorry?  It wasn\'t them that made Uncle Al die.  Brent just couldn\'t understand it.  Why did his uncle have to die?',4,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.79,0,0,0,0,6.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.42,0,0,0,2.32,0,0,0,2.32,0,0,1.16,0,19.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.26,0,0,10.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.58,0,0,0,0,0,1.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'\tThen Mrs hill turned to me and said \"Kenda please don\'t lie!\"  At this point I was steaming.   In the car that day after school I told my mom what had happened.  My mom talked to Miss Poole about what had happened and what Mrs Hill had said.  The next morning Mrs Hill came in while I was using the computer.  She told me she was sorry I had misunderstood her (which really wasn\'t an apology.)  Amber and I had fights from then on.  Miss Pool tried to schedule a meeting but the Hills refused.  We never did get the problem settled.  And now Amber is telling my friends lies about me.  And one by one my friends have been disappearing.  Now can you see how much damage a small lie can do if you stick to it?  Glal Calahoun is that is a fake name I  One day My dad got a new car.  \"I got it for practically nothing.My name is Cloe I am 12 years old.  I have a brother that is 8 and basically your average family, mom, dad, brother and dog.  I\'ve always loved school and been good at it too.  This quarter my lowest grade on my report card was a 93.  Because I was held back I\'ve always been closer to my teachers than the rest of the kids.  And some times it causes problems such as this one.  It was the last day of summer.  And I had just been informed by my mother that a girl I knew from church and my best friend were going to be in my fourth grade class.  So at that moment of course I was jumping up and down and shouting for joy.  The next day at school we were told the rules and seating arrangements.  It went like any other first day no homework or any work for that matter just getting familiar with fourth grade.\tBut it was all down hill from there.  One day I was asked to lead the class to computer class.  We were told as usual not to run or talk.  Amber\'s mother was our computer teacher. So Amber thought she was the boss.  She ran ahead of me and I tried to stop her.  Of course just my luck we were caught by the third grade teacher.  Mrs Schwab made us go back to class.  When we got there our teacher Miss Poole asked us what had happened.  Amber lied to her and said I was the one running and she was the one who tried to stop me.  So Mrs Poole told us to go back to computer class and apologize for being late and tell Mrs Hill (Amber\'s mom) what happened.  We apologized and then Amber told her little lie stroy.

'There once was this girl named Stacey who was living with her Dad, Stepmother, two sisters and her little brother. The two sisters Holly and Amanda went out of town to visit their grandmother for a while. So while Stacey\'s parents were and work Stacey and her little brother went to their grandmother because Stacey didn\'t want to baby-sit a six month old baby alone in a house by a creek. So one day which was the fourth of July everyone came over to Stacey\'s house and they ate barbecue. After a while everyone got in Stacey\'s Dad\'s van and the went to a horse race and then to see some fireworks. On the way home, Stacey heard her stepmom and Dad arguing. After they had dropped everyone off Stacey took her little brother and put him in his crib. Her parents were still arguing. They argued until about midnight. In the morning Stacey woke up and heard that they were still arguing. So she got up because she heard a struggle going on. She saw her parents in the bathroom fighting, not just arguing, slapping and pushing and cursing and punching, and ripping. Her Dad punched her stepmom and then pushed her into the tub. Her stepmom got up punching him and cursing. She grabbed onto his shirt and he grabbed her by the head and threatened you let me go and I\'ll let you go. So finally they both let go and they both left for work leaving Stacey and her little brother alone.There once was a thirteen year old girl named Dieanna. It was her summer vacation so she wanted to go visit her Dad. Also since her brother, stepsister, and stepmom who was pregnant was there. She really wanted to go. So her mom and stepdad with whom she lived with let her go. One night everyone was sitting around watching television and they heard their Dad yelling and then we heard a slap and wrestling around, and cussing and punches. Everyone ran out of the room to see what was going on and her stepmom, stepsisters, and Dieanna saw their dad fighting with their brother Matthew there was not much anyone could do to stop this seeing how the stepmother was pregnant, the stepsisters were too young and he would not listen to Dieanna. After that I guess Matthew just got tired of his Dad jumping on him so he pushed his Dad and ran out of the house. His Dad started running after him and he caught up and they started wrestling and hitting each other finally Deanna\'s brother got loose and he ran  and ran and ran. In a way Deanna was happy he got free, she was mad at her Dad and she was sad for her brother because of what had just happened to him. So she started crying and took off running down the street since her grandparents lived there and stayed with her grandparents for the night. For the next three days nobody heard from Matthew. Finally Matthew called Deanna and her Grandparents.So, Stacey took her brother and she called their grandmother to come get them. Stacey was so horrified that she didn\'t want to stay in that house alone. So she got her brother dressed, made his bottles, packed a few toys, extra diapers, etc and called her stepmom and told her that they were going to their grandmothers. About two minutes later her grandmother came and picked them up. They stayed there all day and after Stacey\'s stepmom got off work she picked her little brother up and since Stacey was horrified and so mad at her dad she didn\'t want to go back. A few days had passed and things got better and her parents made up and things were back to normal again.',2,-4,0,1,1,0,6.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,3.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,3.08,Female51
'When I woke up I skipped breakfast and got dressed then I laid on the couch.  When I heard \"Everybody out in the car\" I got my stuff and went.  I sleep in the car too then went to church.  After it ended we dropped off the boys and went to Saint Luke.  My mom braided my hair and kissed me good-bye so I went off.  First we did the spelling pre-test.  I got minus three but I\'ll do good tomorrow.  Then came math I think I did an extra assignment plus my school in one day one time I got 100.  After we did English in which we wrote about little me snipping out leaves from tees.  Social studies well we just read in our book.  Lunch finally I had pizza and a cherry drink.  In recess my friends and I played tag and hide and go seek.  band was a blast after playing our songs we got three candy pieces.  Then came science- religion.  We only got science done because we did not have enough time.I hope I get to finish this then work on my English and go home.  At home I will do nay work if I even have any and go outside to play baseball with my five brothers and two sisters. Then I might play computer until we eat dinner, and say our rosary.  Since it is the weekend I will probably stay up and play Scrabble with Jon Paul and Ann Marie or Annie.  Then some other game, maybe Guessgends or Balderdash.  When I go to bed I will probably sleep in Annie\'s room and talk a little to her.  By then I might be tired and fall asleep at maybe eleven o\'clock.When I got up I ate breakfast which was bagels then I got dressed for school when we got in the car I sleep on the floor and got woken up to go to mass.  We got to school and I couldn\'t find my backpack I never found it but still got to school.  Lucky for me I carry my binder out of it therefore I had that.  In my backpack there was computer stuff, library books, notebook paper, and my science notes.  We did not have library or computer that day and science we just finished our test thing.  So the day turned out okay.  After school I had OM until 4:30.  When I got home I study for two test I had today for one hour.  After I played outside with my brother Jon Paul cars in the sand.  Then we went inside and Jon Paul had not done homework he forgot him math book.  He started crying so mom told me to call Bridget McCall and ask the problems.  They were a X problems so that was easy.

'\tI not extremely upset I just don\'t think it is fair. My soccer game was postponed to Friday.  The day of my camping trip, and I won\'t get to go until the next day.  I can\'t decide whether to go camping or play soccer because my soccer team is in the championship game.  Oh well!  The end.  One time when my parents almost had to sell our horses I got really upset.  Because I really love my horses.  But it turned out okay and we didn\'t sell our horses.\tIn second grade this boy kept sending me love letters.  He would send at least 5 a day.  All my friends kept teasing me.  Finally even though it was really embarrassing I told my mom. She told me to just ignore him.  I did. It didn\'t work so I talked to my brother he just said tell him to quit bugging you.  So I did.  It didn\'t work.  I just decided to let him bug me and write me letters.  After a month or two it was really getting on my nerves so I told the teacher and he took him out in the hall.

'\tYesterday I left off with my?  I don\'t know I will just start off here.  I remember my dad coming over a lot. I don\'t know why, but he did.  Now he takes me, my step sister, my step brother, and my step mom on trips.  He never takes my older siblings.  They feel left out.  My dad can be rude sometimes!  He cares about his new kids (They are 9 and 7 but they are new to him) more than me!  It is awful.  You would think so too if it happened to you.  I wish my parents never had met each other!  My oldest brother is staying with my dad this week.  My dad lives in Grand Prairie. (1 hour away.)  I hate going over there.  It is a pain in the rear driving over there when I hate it!  That is proof that the world is definitely not perfect.  My life is all messed up.  I like my life and hate my life all at the same time.\tThe most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was actually the most upsetting thing to the whole family.  It was when my parents got a divorce.  Even my dog seemed depressed!  ( Well not really, but he missed my dad. )  They got divorced when I was one year old.  I have been going to counseling for a long time.  It has not really helped yet.  I remember the day I was old enough to understand what had happened. I started going to my dad\'s house when I was three because that is when he moved out.  Now both my mom and my dad are remarried.  ( Not to each other though ) I like my step dad, but I hate my step mom though.  Sometimes I think it is my fault but I know they have told me a million times that that is not true.  It must be!  I have three brothers and a sister.  I was the last one born.  Maybe it is not true but I tend to think it is.  It makes me feel bad, when my parents give me a choice on whose house I would like to go to.  My mom and dad pressure me.  ( Bribe me. )  My brother Daniel is staying with my dad this week but I never get to go.\tI will start where I left off.  No my dad goes to the football games.  Every weekend.  Us kids have to stay at home.  One of our baby sitters got put in jail two weeks ago because he did something to Whitney, (my sister), Katie (my friend), Katie\'s sister Becky and me.  Now I will tell you about that.  His name is Chris.  He is a teacher at Whitney, Katie, and Becky\'s school.  Now, we started trusting him.  He became a good friend.  (Well we thought he was).  He started touching us in the wrong places.  My sister Whitney was the first one to tell.  We don\'t talk about much.  He has been to jail four times and has gotten out every time.  I had to go to the Grand Prairie Police Department and talk to Detective Frizzell.  He was hard to talk to.  I go to counseling two times a week. Once for the divorce and once for this.  I am going today also. I feel like I have a bad life.  I should!  I have a troubled life!  I guess  you could say that I was raped because my mom told me I was.

'Well as it turned out everytime she saw him they would be together for a while the she would get hurt all over again. So she found out about that gun and just out off completely from him. She got a boyfriend but still thought of him. Things were good with her boyfriend and one day her boyfriend took her out and she saw Angel. Her heart started racing and everything about him came back. The next day she called him and the following day he took her out. He\'d take her out go to her house and do stuff with her. She felt like she was on top of the world. It felt so good to be with him, he made her so happy. But she was still with her boyfriend. And their relationship had started to fade away. It completely ended when Jade went our of town for a week. When she came back she called her boyfriend and he said he missed her but the whole time she was gone he tried to get with her friend.  Then she called Angel and he wanted to see her. Angel went to her house. Jade felt bad because Angel wasn\'t her boyfriend. Not long after she called his house and found out he had never broken up with that girl. She talked to the girl and felt completely heartbroken and empty when he told her he was moving in with that girl that\'s all she could think about and she felt so alone and it hurt inside herWell once there was this girl named Jade. Jade had known a guy named Angel for almost a year.  She used to talk to him and she liked him allot. They talked for about a month and she did something that really upset him. This upset him so much that he decided not to see her no more. Jade felt bad but there was nothing she could do. She kept waiting and hoping for the little chance that he would forgive her and take her back. Then one day Jade heard he had a girlfriend, and she felt so sad when she saw them together for the first time. Soon after that everywhere she went she saw them. And it hurt her everytime. No matter how many guys she met, she just could not forget him. Then one day she called him and they were talking.. He wanted to be with her again so they started talking. It continued like this on and off for a little less that a year. And like always she got mad and more hurt everytime. She decided to move on but still there was a place in hear heart for him that she could not forget. She got a boyfriend who cared for her and treated her like a queen. But it just wasn\'t the same like it was with Angel. She thought about him constantly and felt very guilty because of her boyfriend. But what could she do Angel was always on her mind.

I saw my band director during recess.  I also saw the people who were in band.  Like my sister, Sheeba, etceteras.  Then I went to my classroom to get my binder and books.  Then I went to Miss Cool\'s room.  I did social studies.  When we finished I went to my classroom.  We had art.  My art teacher is Miss Hammon.  So we painted flowers.  Then we finished and she left.  Then we got our stuff ready to go home.  I packed and I picked up trash from the floor.  Then we prayed.  We left the room to go to dismissal.  I saw my sister my uncle and my two cousins.  So my uncle took us home.  I was in the car taking out the keys for my hose and I told everyone good- bye.  Then my sister and I got off the car and we were walking toward our apartment.  When I got to my room I started doing my homework.  I was watching television while I was doing my homework.  I forgot what we had to do for an assignment so I called Sheeba.  She wasn\'t home so I went to my room and started doing my other homework.  Then my mom came from work.  I told her Hi.  She started making dinner.  When I finished studying for math I ate dinner.  Then I studied for religion.  Then I finished studying and.I woke up and I saw my sister and my dad.  My mom went to work before I woke up.  Then I got ready for school.  Then I went to school.  I saw my teacher and some of my classmates.  I unpacked.  Then Sheeba came.  I talked to her.  I marked lunch count.  Then I sat down.  We had a religion test at 8:00.  Then I went to math.  I had my math test.  I got 100!  Yea!  Then we did something else, I forgot though.  The we went to lunch.  I ate pizza.  It was really good.  Then after that we went to social studies.  Actually after lunch we had English.  Then we had social studies.  In the middle of social studies we had to come over here.  But first I went to my room to leave my stuff.  Then I came over here.  I wrote.  Then I was going to my room when I saw my class planting.  So Sheeba and I stayed there.  We went back to our class room and Miss Carlton told us we were going to have our science test on Friday.  I was relieved.  So then everybody packed.  I went to take my medicine after I got packed.  Then I went to physical education.  Miss Carlton took five girls including Sheeba to come out to the hall.  She had to go to the restroom so she went.  Then she said we were going to plant.  So I said Yes!  We planted some snow on the mountain flowers.  They\'re real pretty.  After we planted them I went to throw trash near the field with Sheeba.  After we went back where we were planting.  we helped put up the tools we were using to plant.',3,-3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,2.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,8.29,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51

Then I sat with her and we talked all the way to Skyline High School. When we came in the building we went to the student center and posted up at our usual spot. Some other girls were pretty close to us so we fronted them out. Next we walked to the cafeteria, walked around and came back out. The snack line was pretty empty so we went. Patrice did not have her money with her so she asked the boy for he Hershey\'s cookies and cream he said okay and she laughed. then she said no that is okay and we left.',3,-2,0.5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.22,0,0,0,0,4.22,0,0,0,4.22,0,4.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'One day I was so mad at my sister that I kicked her.  She kicked me back and she kicked me on my shin.  That was like last Wednesday and now I have a bruise on my shin and it still hurts a lot if I press on it really hard.  The end.  This story is made up, it is all fake.  Once there was a girl named Nicole she got on my nerves so bad that one day I just punched her in the face and kicked her in the shin.  When I did this she punched me twice and kicked me twice.  One of the other kids that was standing around saw what happened and went and told what happened.  Nicole and I got suspended from school for a week.  We both had to make up the school work we missed.  Our teachers made us work together until we got along.  The end.  There is this boy in my class that gets on everybody\'s nerves even the teachers\' nerves.  He makes these disgusting sounds and is really a pest when he keeps talking a lot.Real story:  one day I wrote a letter to somebody in the eighth grade.  I gave her the letter and waited a few days but she never wrote me back.  I was so upset that I wrote her another letter that was two pages long and gave that one to her too, and I waited a few days and waited a few more days but she never wrote me back.  So guess that she will never write me or be my friend.  To this day I still have no friends nor have gotten a letter from her.  I guess she\'s waiting for me to come personally to talk to her, but she is never alone. What should I do?  Help!  Then end.  Fake story:  one day Allison was playing with her friends, then all of the sudden her friends were not her friends any more.  She was so upset that she went home, went up the stairs to her room and told her mom that she was never coming out of her room, and was not going to talk to anybody anytime or anywhere.My story is about this girl who makes me so mad I could just slap her across the face.  See she says that I lost some papers that I didn\'t even have.  See we had to do this history paper that was due when we did our project.  I never had the paper.  I gave my paper to her to turn in now she says she turned it in but our teacher never got it.  She say she gave it to me to turn in but she didn\'t.  Now she is blaming it on me!  She is the one who lost the paper, not me!  Now I have a failing grade in history, I think.  Now I won\'t be able to manage the girls basketball team for two who weeks.  That makes me so so so so mad.  It is all her fault that the paper was not turned in she had the paper.  So she gets all mad at me and says she is going to make me write the whole paper again, that is if our teacher says we have to do it over again.  Well let me tell you this I will not rewrite that whole entire paper over.  I\'ll make her rewrite it again she lost it.',2,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.9,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,3.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4,1.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4,0,0,1.7,Female51
'\tOnce I came to my house and my dad was there.  He wasn\'t supposed to be home.  I asked him what is wrong and he told me.  I went to Kroger to buy him some medicine.  I came home and gave it to him.  He wouldn\'t take it.  A couple of days later he felt much worse.  My family took him to the hospital.  He stayed for two weeks.  I only got to see him once in the hospital.  When he came home he had to use crutches.  He couldn\'t walk.  He had to stay home a little while too.  He got much better.  My best friend Anna, her father was going on a plane trip.  He was gone for a long time.  One time Anna\'s mother turned on the TV and watched the news.  She heard that a plane crashed.  Anna\'s father was on that plane!  It took a long time to find the plane.My dad sold my hamster.  My dad didn\'t even tell me he was going to sell my hamster.  One day he just came home and told me he sold my hamster.  He was a very cute hamster, he was brown and white. His name was Brownie.  My dad sold him to his secretary\'s grandchildren.  They were very poor.  And the grandchildren were about 3 years old.  When my dad told me I burst into tears.  I asked my dad if he would give them back but all he said was no!  When my dog died he was 13 years old.  His name was Wantan.  He was german.  He got very sick. We took him to the vet.  He stayed there.  About midnight the vet called and said, \"This dog of yours has died. I am very sorry.\"  My mom and dad woke us up.\tMy mom and dad came into my bedroom and told me very clearly.  \"Sweetheart the dog has died!\"  I was so upset I probably cried until midnight.  So there you have no more dog.  One night I woke up and I heard my brother.  He was really sick.  I heard my mother saying, \"Oh my gosh! We have to take him to the hospital!\"  All of my family just flew out of the house and rushed to the hospital.  The minute I knew it my brother was in that old hospital.  He was only one year old.  I was probably crying.  He stayed for about two weeks. Then he came home.  Once I was at a park when when suddenly a man came up to me.  I tried to hide. He just kept looking for me.',4,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.54,0,0,4.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'I was talking in a funny way.  Then, finally I noticed my mom was recording and I told her not to.  She had been recording from about right when I started to talk funny.  After that my mom put the tape in the video camera recorder and started it.  I was upset and embarrassed at the same time.  Last night I was talking to my parents.  I asked them if I could watch the rest of the movie I had rented from the library, \"Meet Me in Saint Louis.\"  They said no.  Then I said please.  Next I got into a big argument with my parents.When I talk and someone is recording it on a video camera, like when my mom was recording when I was talking but in a strange way.  I was talking to my friend but she could.When I did something I really was not supposed to do which was that I had forgotten two of my assignments for school.  I did not really want to tell her but I have to have faith that she would not get mad at me.  Then I told her she was not upset, but I was upset and in tears now.  I went to the bathroom.  I was still crying.  I called myself stupid over and over again.',2,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.09,0,0,0,27.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.45,0,0,27.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.09,0,9.09,0,0,9.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'Well I forgot where I left off. But I\'ll just continue I really don\'t know why I have not talked to someone about this. I guess it\'s because I like to keep a lot of things to myself, like what makes me real mad and what makes me think very crazy. the crazy thoughts I have when I get real upset at someone like my mother or stepfather of my ex-boyfriends. I guess it\'s because I let it build up inside of me too long. I get the urge to just well and scream at who I am mad at. Sometimes I feel that I can just do bad things to that person but I know better, crazy things.  I never actually hit them because I know it\'s wrong, but talking it not going to get it. I want to let that person know how I really feel and I can\'t do it by talking. I feel they wont get my point. Nobody knows about these thoughts all I know is that they just come. too much stress I guess. My mind tells me I worry too much, I think its true. I think I am lucky because I have not had drugs, sex, or violence to depend on. Because I\'m smarter than that. True indeed I\'m going to make something of myself if these worries don\'t get to me. I have school, family, home, anger, pain, the past, the future, and every now and then relationships. And I can\'t forget the number one problem in the world hat. It\'s just that you have so many dreams you just can\'t accomplish.My most upsetting thing is when my mother changed. I did not know what was going on at first but then I caught on to it. It was as soon as we moved to these apartments called Pecan square, to me they are Trouble Square. Everything was cool at first until my mother started staying out all night, and then coming back home with some lame excuse about where she had been, and what se had been through and how she got back home. It was always something. After that my sister started to run away because my mother and stepfather got on her nerves, that is what she said. But I think it is because my momma put us through hell. Trying to keep up with my sister and being worried about my mother made me want to run away too. But my mother said do not ever run away from a fight and that is what I was doing, fighting. The reason why I could not find myself to leave and go live with my father is because your family is like your wife or husband, you stay with them through thick and thin, rich and poor, until death do us part. I never have had the courage or the strength to talk to my mother because I never knew how she would react to the comments and questions I would ask. That is me for you scared of the answers people give me, I do not think I will ever change. Everything started to get worse.I cannot remember where I left off but I can write something else. When I used to love with my aunt and uncle and we were such a big family. It was my mother, my sister, me, my aunt\'s three children, my aunt, and my uncle. It was crowded. Even though we were happy it was still bad worrying about my mother. I got tired of going to school and I got very careless. It was like I went from this little life filled girl with a wonderful family to this preteen who has no life left not even my own. It really made me mad to see myself this way. But I guess I won\'t complain because if it were not for the pain I would not have found my hidden talent. Writing poetry. Words can mean a lot when they are coming from your heart, that is what I heard in my sleep so the next morning I got up and started to write down what was going on in my life. Boy, did I have a story to tell. As a big family we had our disputes, and as a big family we would make up. But there was one thing that I still do not understand. Why did this happen to me? I know it is don\'t worst, but why?',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.2,0,0,0,26.01,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,1.3,0,39.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.51,0,0,26.01,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.4,6.5,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,2.6,Female51
'I plan to go to gym then back to this room and learn until school is out.  Then I\'m going to do my homework and do something on my own time and eat dinner.  I haven\'t decided what I\'m going to do yet, like maybe watch television or talk on the phone.  I have to do my homework first before anything else though.  It is a rule.  I hope we still get to go to the library today, I need a new book badly.  I don\'t have anything else to say that I can think of!I woke up and got ready for school.  The only thing that I did different from what I usually do is I dressed differently.  When I came to school I rehearsed with the rest of the kids and then performed later.  I was still frustrated that Clinton won the election and still am now.  I went to science and math and electives which are my favorite classes.  Electives are.  Now I\'m in History /Literature/ Grammar/ Vocabulary literature class.  We are going to gym next which I don\'t really care for at all!  Well, at least Clinton won\'t have a chance at winning in the next four years!  Go Republicans!I got up at six in the morning and watched the news for the weather.  I was disappointed to hear that Clinton was leading the polls so far, and I hope that Dole wins!  I took a shower and got dressed and made my bed.  Then I went downstairs and ate cereal and took my vitamin pills.  Then I went upstairs and dried my hair, washed my face and brushed my teeth.  Then it was time for me to go downstairs again so my dad could roll my hair.  Rolling it does give it more body, but it makes my hair two inches shorter than it really is.  I went back upstairs and brought my backpack and my shoes and a clip downstairs.  Then we took the rollers out and Dad put my clip in my hair and sprayed it.  Then I took my lunch and backpack and we got into the car and went to school.

'The most upsetting experience I have had lately would be not knowing where my baby\'s father was for around thirty hours. In the last four days I have seen him for around two hours. From Sunday around seven until today Tuesday afternoon. That is real upsetting not knowing where your loved ones are. Well I know he was not locked up or in the hospital because I called to see. Well all I know is that I hope to God and pray to him that he was not doing anything that could hurt me and his baby. Well to tell you the truth I was worried but not that much because I needed and wanted time alone. Last night when he came I was kind of mad that he did not stay longer, I know that is kind of mean to say or write but it is the truth. Sometimes I think I am just with him because I want my baby to have both it\'s parents with him through the years while at other times I am happy with him. It is the things he does that really make me feel that way. Not getting much affectionate that is what bothers me a lot since I was used to it by my ex-boyfriend. Both of them are so different in every way. Well that is an upsetting experience for  me. The upsetting experience I had today was not getting in the breakfast line just when I got in the cafeteria. I sat down to talk to my home girl Eira since the line was real long. I got up just when to line started to get small. Well when I reached the line the bell went off and she did not let me stay in line. It was a good breakfast too pancakes with sausage. I miss all the good ones. Well the thing is that I am pregnant and I need food. One of the most upsetting thing that ever happened to me is not showing my affectionate towards the people I truly care about. Now that Ii know Ii should I will tell everyone how Ii feel about them as much as possible, cause Iii know it feels good to hear that someone cares about you. Ever since I did not tell that one person I loved me feelings towards them when they really needed to hear it, everything all changed for me in my life. Now I know I will show and tell my affections towards all people. I never thought that all this could be happening too me because of that little mistake I did. But I can not tell  him now since I never see or talk to him,  but in my mind I always do and I am always wishing to see him to tell him everything will be like it used to be.The second most upsetting experience for me was having a baby in my tummy at an early age. I am only fourteen and already five months pregnant. I don\'t consider my baby a mistake. Don\'t get me wrong because I love my baby. What I consider upsetting is my age, I am going to finish school and everything and keep care of my baby. It is the most happiest thing of my life. I\'ll miss out on a lot of my teenage years but that doesn\'t mean I won\'t be a mommy to my baby because to me the baby didn\'t have a choice so it shouldn\'t have to suffer without parents. I guess you really don\'t call this an upsetting experience but a happy experience. The only thing I find upsetting is my age because I am just fourteen going on fifteen when the baby arrives in February.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.25,0,0,9.38,0,3.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,0,0,3.13,18.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.25,0,0,0,0,23.44,0,3.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.7,0,0,18.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,31.26,0,1.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.25,Female51
'I can\'t think of anything right now so this is really really upsetting.  I am not the kind of person whose life is perfect or anything, so this really gets me mad,  Why can\'t I thing of anything?  I know that I have had a lot of times when I feel like I could blow up the Earth and still be mad but nothing is coming to me.  Usually I can get mad over little things that are pointless but I don\'t know.  I can\'t put that much attention into this.  I don\'t know why.  I mean it is quiet and all but nothing is coming to mind,  Maybe it is because I really did not want to do anything today, or maybe because I am anxious.  I don\'t know why.  I can only think of one thing and that does not make me that upset.  Actually I don\'t even care about it anymore.  I have no clue what to write about.  I just can\'t think of anything.  I need to keep writing, but what about?  I guess I will just keep writing about nothing.  Nothing is happening.  Nothing at all.  My mind is totally somewhere else.  Can\'t concentrate.  Can\'t think of anything.  Usually by now I would have figured out something but I can\'t.  Write write write I have to keep writing.  Can\'t think of anything but I need to keep writing.  Must keep writing.  Maybe it is not so frustrating anymore.  My mind is totally gone.Yesterday I could not think of anything and that made me mad.  But today I thought of something.  For the first five years I was in America, I went to a school called Indian Creek.  Everybody there went to Arbor Creek after that except me.  I came here to Prince of Peace.  The first day, I did not talk to anybody.  Not even the teachers.  I was so mad at my parents for making me come here.  The second day Mister Thurmon and Coach Han stood behind me during physical education and started talking about me.  They were not trying to be mean or anything they just said things like \"she never talks to me during class\" or \"I don\'t have a problem with her maybe she just does not like you.\"  I figured maybe the teachers aren\'t that bad.  But that was only the teachers.  I still did not like anybody else.  That day I realized that one of the people there went to my old school two years ago.  Nobody knew where he went but I guess nobody cared much.  This other girl and him would be walking and look at me and whisper.  Before that I thought everybody was stuck up and that convinced me.  I hated everybody there.  When I got home I told my parents there was no way I was going back to that school it had been two days and it felt like it had been two years.  I called some of my friends from my old school to see.Yesterday I was writing about my first day at school here at Prince of Peace.  I am not sure where I left off but I will try not to write things I have already written.  I was talking to my friends on the phone and they were telling me all the new people that had come to the school and how everybody except me was there.  That made me happy for them but I was even more upset because I could not be there.  The next day I went to school and there was one girl who I had met at Mister Gattie\'s.  Kids from Prince of Peace went there to meet the new kids.  I told her I was going to try and make friends with some people who had tried to make friends with me.  That\'s when she told me all about who not to be friends with because they were brats or because they were stuck up or any other bad qualities they had.  After that I really did not want to make friends with anybody at all.  I knew she was not trying to be mean by doing this but that told me everybody was a snob.  I decided I would hang out with her and make friends with all her friends.  That worked.  After that I made friends with their friends too.  By the second week at school I had more friends than people who had been there from three to six years.  Some of those people, for the longest time they tried to be friends with some of the people I had made friends with in two days.',2,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,0,0,6.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.37,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,0,0,27.69,0,0,8.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.04,11.32,0,2.52,0,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.03,Female51
'Well my step dad is always talking about my dad he does not even know him the only reason my mom wanted to get ten thousand dollars out of him is because of my step dad. We do not even always get the child support money that my dad sends in the mail. She does not even bother to tell us when it comes in. My step dad and mom both make me feel like I am stupid that I do not know what I am doing. Sometimes if I fail something on my report card I get in trouble if my sister even fails anything they say well I think you need to try better next time. That is the end of that conversation. Also my sister is always trying to say things to get my in trouble and most of the time it is same thing she does. My dad trusts me and I respect that very much but my mom does not trust me and she even told me that to my face. I would like to live with my dad and I would like for my mom to start trusting my because really I have not done anything for her not to trust me. She won\'t even let me go over to my best friend\'s house when I have my phone taken away because she thinks I am using her phone. Even when I  tell her I am not she says yeah right. Then she starts yelling at me. My mom never acted like this until we moved in this new house with my step dad and she even is acting a little snobby.My mom wouldn\'t let my dad see us and everytime he would try to come get us she would say it isn\'t his weekend. She told him that on Thanksgiving and it was my birthday too. then my mom took my dad to court to try to get ten thousand out of him at one time then she decided not to since he was sending child support every month. Now my mom is trying to keep up with her until we move out and get our own place but Ii don\'t want to stay there because my mom makes me feel like I am stupid and my sister is an angel. Also my mom doesn\'t trust me and takes my phone. She won\'t let me call my dad or my grandma that lives in Missouri. My dad is going to take my mom back to court and he is going to fight that and try to make us not go. My mom never started acting like this until she met my step dad then she started saying all this stuff about him that she doesn\'t even know about my step dad does the something with us standing there. My step dad watched me even when I just walk out in the drive to talk to one of my friends and when I talk on the phone he turns down the television so he can hear every word I am saying. Even when I go to the skating rink he says I am doing things there too.  They think I am stupid.Probably the most upsetting that happened in my life was when my parents divorced. When my parents divorced my mom started dating actually before they split up. That hurt me to know that my mom had done that. She started to yell at my sisters for everything we done we had to do things that she wanted us to do not things that we wanted to do. She got where she would not let us see our Dad when he wanted to see us. About the only time we got to is when she wanted to do something and did not want us around. My Dad would sometimes pick me and my sister up a little early from school. My sister not want us going with him so she went up too my school and talked to the counselor and my mom and the counselor started to talk about my Dad and say bad things about him that was not even true and that they knew anything about. they started saying that my Dad was not worth anything and that my Mom could put a paper in my life saying that she did not my Dad picking us up early. Then about six months later my Mom and her boyfriend started looking for a house thinking that they could get away from my Dad. They found one and we moved in. My dad started to come and pick us up every other weekend. Well my Mom and now her husband would not let my Dad come to our house and pick us up and bring us home. He has to meet us somewhere and then bring us back there.

'My dad is against my aunt Lora.  And for some reason my mom\'s whole family!  They had a big fight last year.  My sister and I were crying.  My mom and dad fighting.  My mom went into my room where my sister and I were crying.  We locked the door.  My dad was fixing to run the door down.  My dad wanted us to leave the room.  But then my mom said \"The don\'t see you when you close the door.\"  \"How you treat me and stuff!\"  This was highly upsetting because I didn\'t like to see my parents fight!  But I make it look like they are horrible parents.  But the are not!  They care enough to send me to school.  We aren\'t low class people.  My great great grandpa founded Montaro in Mexico!  Back to the upsetting topic!  My parents hardly fight.  When we lived in Puerto Rico they stole three cars from us!  And a bunch of other stuff.  But we are born in Spain we are not Puerto Rican!  Another upsetting thing would be that my great aunt on my mom\'s side died just a few months ago.  We could not make it to the funeral.  I didn\'t ever get to meet my great aunt.  Not even at death!Last summer my grandpa died.  I was very sad.  My dad didn\'t like him very much.  One day two weeks before he died, he called us.  In the morning.  I just woke up.  He wanted to talk to me but my dad said no.  My grandpa was calling us a lot.  He so badly wanted to talk to me.  That night my mom and dad had a huge fight.  My mom wanted to rip my dad apart.  So did I.  One week later he died.  My dad was crying.  My mom said \"Well I hope you\'re happy now!\"  That was stuck on my dad\'s conscience.  I was mad.  My little brother was nine months old at the time.  He didn\'t get to meet my grandpa.  He gave a star that is in space to all his grandchildren.  Except my brother.  But still today I miss him.  I am very sad.  Everything reminds me of him.  Right before he dies, he was very skinny.  I would not have recognized him. I went to his funeral.  Still today I\'m a little mad at my dad.  My aunt is very manipulative.  She criticizes everything.  She has a paralyzed daughter and she doesn\'t car about her.  She asks for money for her kid, and she uses it for herself.  When we went to the funeral of my grandpa, she was just their for the inheritance.My aunt is very manipulative.  She took advantage of my grandfather.  Leslie my made up friend has the same problem.  Unlike mine, her parents often fight.  Well, as I was saying my aunt Lora she has a paralyzed daughter.  She doesn\'t pay much attention to her.  She asks for money for her kid.  And she uses it on herself.  When we went to my grandfather\'s funeral, we all stayed in my other aunt\'s house.   My grandpa had a lot of stuff.  She said that my older sister was demanding a guitar.  That was just a big fat lie.  My aunt whom we were staying with was the beneficiary.  She sent to lock the doors to his house.  But my aunt Lora brain washed the guard so she could get in.  She said that she should get seventy percent of the inheritance.  My mom and my aunt Lora and my aunt Lisa are all sisters.  My mom and  my aunt Lisa know my aunt Lora very well.  When my grandpa went to visit my aunt Lora he was kind of blind is one eye.  So my aunt Lora put all the food on the side that he couldn\'t see on.  And they would laugh.  She calls herself a Catholic.  What a big fat lie!  She is a disgrace to the family!',4,-5,1,1,5,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.94,0,5.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.41,0,0,0,2.94,0,0,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,13.23,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.87,0,0,4.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.82,Female51
'\tRemember when I wrote to you last time?  Well Erin is still my friend. Brittany is still mean to me.  Erin and me are so, so, so upset.  She always trying to talk to me.  I never really listen.  I think she is trying to say \"sorry.\"  I guess I\'ll never know.  I have never told this story to anyone except mom and you.  Erin is very mad too.  Why is Brittany so mean?  Well Brittany is mean so that is that.  Do you remember what Brittany even said?  Brittany said \"Erin will you tell me something rude so that I will like Brittany better.\"  Erin did it.  Boy was I mad, mad, mad.  This all happened about two weeks ago.\tWell Erin is still Brittany\'s friend.  I\'m not.  My other upsetting thing is one day my brother pulled the plug out of the game I was playing.  I was on the fourth level!  Then when I was watching TV my brother changes the channel!  That is it!  I called for my mom.  \"Mommy\"!  I yelled, I was so upset!  My mom comes into the room.  My brother was still watching TV!  My mom said that I could watch what I wanted!  My mom is very nice indeed!  I yelled at my brother \"never ever change the channel again!  My show was over!  Man!  Sheesh!My friend Erin was at school.  Brittany and me were walking on the playground.  Erin said to me that Brittany is mean.  Erin said that Brittany called her a jerk.  I was mad because I thought Brittany wouldn\'t say a thing like that.  I didn\'t talk to Erin for two days.  When I came home my mother said \"Brittany asked Erin to say something mean so that I would like Brittany more.\"  I said I was sorry me and Erin were friends again.  Then I heard that Brittany did call Erin a jerk.  It was true.  I felt really sorry now.  I didn\'t want to be Brittany\'s friend if she would call names.  Sarown (my other best friend) and I decided that we weren\'t going to be her friend.  I play with Erin a lot to make up for not playing with her.

'I think my house is very pretty.  I have had so many memories in it. That is another reason why I don\'t want to go to Albuquerque.  I just don\'t want to leave behind my friends.  I hate it when my mom talks about Albuquerque in front of me.  It upsets me when my mom starts yelling at me for something that I didn\'t do, either that or when she yells at me when I did something but she overreacts when she yells.  I hate it when she does that it scares me.  Then I start to cry and I go somewhere and I get out paper and a pen and start writing about what just happen.  Then I start thinking what it would be like without my mom and by doing that I just start crying more.  After awhile my mom will come in and apologize.  I hate even more when she does that.  Then I always forgive her.  And then I hate myself when I do that.  One time this summer I was at my babysitters.  Me my best friend and my friend were at Margaret\'s house my babysitter\'s daughter.  Me and Kellie were playing Mario Brothers Three on the Super Nintendo.  Margaret, I suppose, got jealous and got the television control and started switching the channels.  We asked her politely to please stop.  And she did.  After awhile she started up again.  Then we asked her politely to stop.  But she didn\'t stop then she realized that she had to so to the bathroom.  So.One of the most upsetting things that has happened to me was when my mom told me that we were going to move to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  I got mad at my mom I didn\'t scream at her I just got really mad.  I didn\'t\' want to move there.  She told me it would be a great experience.  Especially to see all the mountains in the background.  I still didn\'t want to I thought that if I went I couldn\'t see my friends much anymore.  but then she said I could come here one time every month with my dad.  My dad would come probably to help my uncle his brother, with his job.  My uncle isn\'t really doing a great job in making money at his firm.  Another reason I didn\'t want to go is because I wanted to stay at our house.  I loved my house.  I didn\'t think in New Mexico there would be another house like it.  I love our house very, very, much.

'When we moved, thought Carlyn, everything changed.  The climate, my friends, soccer, piano, youth group, church, everything.  She was in her room doing her homework. Only she wasn\'t paying much attention to her math problems.  Carlyn knew they\'d moved many times, but she\'d been too young to remember.  Why move now, when she was just going into high school?  there were some advantages to the move though.  For one thing, the house was huge.  I mean, she didn\'t have to share a room with her seven year old sister, did she?  Finally, Carlyn could decorate her room the way she wanted to.  She\'d be getting new furniture this year, too.  Then she could finish decorating her room with soccer, school and youth group pictures, as well as some posters.  She suddenly decided to pin her shirt signed by all her classmates up on her wall.  Then she\'d have pictures of every groups she\'d been in in Massachusetts.  She did make some new friends at school, and she had been accepted into the youth group at church.  Carlyn realized that you never know how many friends you really have until you move, that is.  Then you have to write letters to them and that takes forever.  She went over to her dresser and opened the drawer in which she kept all her letters and sighed.  There were about twenty letters she had to write, and most of them were still from July and it was already October.  Carlyn went into the sunroom and turned on the computer.  She entered the Microsoft Bob program, and opened the letter writer.Carlyn was very happy.  She had just come back from visiting her great grandmother who she called Mimi, in the nursing home.  Mimi was eighty- three years old, and was very frail.  Carlyn knew Mimi was dying, but how could someone who had been there for you for as long as you could remember die?  It just didn\'t seem real that Mimi could leave them any day now.  Carlyn did find some comfort in the fact that Mimi was a Christian.  Mimi liked Carlyn, and to Carlyn, she was one of the best people she knew.  When Mimi died soon after their visit, Carlyn was very sad, and almost angry at God for taking her away.  Gradually Carlyn realized that Mimi was in a better place, where she couldn\'t suffer or die.  She leaned on her family and friends for a while after Mimi\'s death.  A couple of years after this, another shock came to Carlyn\'s life.  Her father announced that he\'d been offered a job in Oklahoma.  How could she leave all her friends in Massachusetts?  Who\'d be valedictorian for her class next year if she wasn\'t there?  Why Oklahoma of all places!  In the last few months of school, Carlyn tried to cram in as many activities with her friends as she could.  She had a birthday party for her birthday in the beginning of June.  Her three best friends, Jill, Christina, and Abby came to it and slept over.  That was the last time she\'d seen them.  On the day the movers came, she went over her friend Karen\'s house.Carlyn continued to think in her room.   However, she\'d finally finished her homework.  Now she was thinking about the sports she was involved in.  Her old soccer team, the Enfield Dragons, was a good team, very good, in fact. She had five or maybe seven trophies they won on that team.  Velocity, her new team, was good.  Not as good as the Dragons, but they were good.  She was one of the star players on this tam, and kind of liked all the attention and praise she was getting.  But she knew it wasn\'t good for the team if she became a ball hog, so she tried to pass as much as she could.  Soccer season was almost over and Carlyn was trying out for the school basketball team.  She was really bad, and she knew it.  Just about the only thing she could do was block shots.  She could keep up with everyone based on stamina and endurance, but she was always faked out by their dribbling moves. Carlyn knew that when they actually started playing, she\'d be called a lot for fouls because she didn\'t know  the rules of the game.  Right then and there Carlyn decided to take an hour everyday to practice dribbling left and right hand.  But first, she\'d have to finish her homework.  Looking down at her math book, Carlyn made a face.  this was another disadvantage of moving from Massachusetts to Oklahoma she had to do thirty algebra problems everyday after school.  With a sigh of resignation, she set out to work on her inequalities, volume, surface area, and any other troublesome algebra problems.  This ends my story about Carlyn McGriff, whose great grandmother died and who had to move to Oklahoma from Massachusetts.  Carlyn made a face.  This was another disadvantage of moving to Oklahoma.

'Continuing the story from the other day my friend Michelle got married to twenty two year old Daniel they were both my friends but they did do much but get married. Michelle and I went through a lot of things especially when her mom died just a few months ago in January, I was there it hurt me just as much as it hurt me because I loved her Mom so much. During the funeral Michelle didn\'t cry. But when I went to hug her she let it all out on me so did her brother. It hurt me because they were my best friends to see them both suffer and crying and it hurt me when more when Daniel had told Michelle to get married with him I couldn\'t help the pain It still hurts and it\'s because I don\'t show off my feelings I keep them to myself and it hurts me even more. I don\'t show my feelings to nobody and I can\'t help feeling bad but I think people won\'t care so there is no was I can get it out of myself. But all I hope is that Daniel treats her well. And that Michelle treats Daniel well too. But I won\'t forget that Michelle and I built a lot of up and she messed up and destroyed them and now it\'s kind of hard to build them back up.Well Michelle got married to Daniel and now she\'s three months pregnant. She doesn\'t want to talk to me no more and she only say \"hey\" or \"hello.\" But that all and it really hurts me because she\'s my homegirl and I love her as a sister. But if she doesn\'t want to speak to me that\'s all right because I will always be there for her no matter what ever happens. Well that about what I can tell you for now. I\'ll keep on trying to talk to her but know it will really be up to her if she rather listen to herself or listen to her husband Daniel. I really hope that she will talk to me because I really miss talking to her and I also miss going out to the movies, mall, out to each and all those places we would go before she got married at fourteen years old. That\'s all I really got to say now.

'The most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me could be my parents divorce when I was only five years old.  I had two other sisters and my mom and their dad had also divorced.  My mom, me, and my two sisters all lived together in a small house and later an apartment.  My mom was having to constantly work.  She did not know about all the parties and drugs my sister Tracey was involved in.  My mom went to a high school reunion and met my step- dad.  We moved in with him to Plano from Dallas.  My sister Tracey still did drugs, my other sister was doing good, and I saw my dad every other weekend.  Well my sister constantly snuck out for weeks at a time till we found her.  She finally was sent to rehabilitation five times.  The last time was in Florida where her dad lived.  She also got her graduate equivalency diploma.  She dropped out of high school.  My sister Jena graduated but did not go to college.  My sister Tracey got pregnant at age eighteen, had a miscarriage, got married to my brother-in-law, Charlie who has the same birthday as me which is today, November 5.  My sister Tracey got pregnant again and had my nephew Kyle David Rich who is twenty months old now.  Tracey is now twenty years old twenty-one in December.  My other sister married at age twenty to my brother-in-law Brent Eary.  Two years later she had my niece Claudia Danielle Eary who is fifteen months old.  About five months ago my dad didn\'t come see me anymore or call me.  I moved to another place in Plano about two months ago and don\'t care if I see my dad again.  One night my mom woke me up, my brother-in-law had hit and kicked my sister and she ended up staying with us for three months with my niece too.  She and him are still married and along now.Well I guess that is about all to say about my dad.  So now I will start a new topic.  I used to go to Carrollton Christian Academy but got expelled.  I first got in trouble for purposely spilling coke on some girl that didn\'t even go to our school!  Then me and another good friend got caught making out with our boyfriends in the boys bathroom.  The last straw was when my ex-boyfriend called the school and said I made a nasty phone call to him.  That was a really big lie!  I had to leave all my really good friends behind.  The only good thing is that I still hang out with my best friend.  I wish I could go back I would never do that stuff on school grounds again.  Well, now I am writing what I just wrote over again to take up time.  I used to go to Carrollton Christian Academy but got expelled.  I first purposely spilt coke on a girl who didn\'t ever go to our school!  Then me and another good friend got caught making out with our boyfriends in the boys bathroom.After my stepdad, mom, and I moved I really did not make an effort to call or contact my dad.  One day I called his house and his girlfriend\'s daughter answered.  I wanted to talk to her.  It had been three years since I last saw her.  I talked to her for about twenty minutes because she was going to the mall with my dad and her mom.  I haven\'t talked to my dad in about five or six months and I don\'t think he\'s ever tried to contact me.  He smokes about five packs of cigarettes a day and sometimes I\'m scared he will die before I get to say that I love him.  I don\'t know if he tried to contact me for my birthday yesterday but I doubt it.  For a long time he didn\'t pay child support but my mom took him to court and he pays now.  Some nights I cry myself to sleep missing him and my sister Tracey, my nephew, and brother-in-law who live in Florida and visit some Christmas.  I only cried at night when nobody was around but during the day I would hold it in.  Well, last year I got very sick and had to stay in the hospital for a week.  I ended up having chronic gastritis from being so stressed out.  I even had to take Demerol sometimes.  I recently started getting in trouble with guys.  My mom said I was boy crazy and said no more boys are allowed to call me.  She is uneasy about them because about all of them are over the age of fourteen.',3,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0,6.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.22,0,0,3.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'One of the most upsetting experiences was when my dad was dying.   It as very painful to watch him go.  He was in Hospice, so he got to stay home most of the time.  He had lung cancer and other things associated with lung cancer.  During the last six months of his life, he and I grew very close together.  I was only eleven at the time this happened.  I would give him medicine everyday and read to him.  He and I would have many talks together.  He loved talking to people.  And whenever her would talked bout dying, he would show no sign that he was scared.  Many things happened while he was dying.  I got closer to my annoying half-brother.  I took on a great deal of responsibility without whining a lot.  And I gained my dad\'s love.  Right before he died, he told my mother that out of all his daughters I was his favorite.  Of course now my mother would not admit she said that.  There were things I wish I never did to upset him.  Like one time, my mother made these disgusting banana pancakes that tasted horrible.  I screamed that I didn\'t want to eat them and my dad started crying.  I remember him saying that \"this is one of the mornings I felt good and you\'re ruining it\" or something like that.  Whenever my mother made something disgusting, I didn\'t make such a big scene.  The doctors thought once he was diagnosed, he would only live about two or three months at the most.  He lived six.Well, anyway it has been two years since he died.  He died on August 13, 1994.  Same year Kurt Cobain died.  Kurt is one person I admire.  Thirteen was always one of my unlucky numbers.  I never had a very god day on the number thirteen.  It\'s kind of ironic that he died on that day.  Whenever we went to the hospital, my dad looked like he was sleeping.  For some reason, my mother suggested I massage his legs.  I always did that when he was alive, because the were bloated because of the medicine.  We left each other in good terms.  He knew I loved him and I knew he loved me.  My father was very liable.  He could start a conversation with anyone, he had lots of friends, and everyone liked him.  Maybe two times a year I would read a stupid book how a daughter looses her father and I would start crying and I would miss my daddy.  My mom is dating this guy named Charlie and he\'s kind of nerdy and dorky.  I don\'t really mind because it\'s her life.  I only mind because sometimes it cuts into what I want to do.  One time, I woke up and I swore I could smell my dad\'s cigarette smoke and him humming in the office.  I walked in, completely forgotten that he had died, and saw that he wasn\'t there.  I loved sitting on his lap and we would sing some song.  It was our special song, but I forgot it.  I love my daddy and every night I pray that he\'s happy in heaven.  I know it sounds childish, but I do it anyway.I think my dad kept on living because of my sister and me.  The last time the ambulance ever took him from the hospital, I remember him coughing up black stuff.  For some reason, that is one of the things I remember most.  I remember his eyes also.  They were full of pain but was determined to live.  He couldn\'t walk, was in pain all the time, and had lots of medicine.  He even had a form of heroin:  morphine.  He had two big bottles of it, but he could only take like one milliliter or something like that at a time.  Sometimes I try to look for it, to get a little high or something.  I think about how much money I could\'ve sold it for.  I would have gotten a lot.  Because of his death, I gotten to be a little tougher, but some things just upset me.  Like one day, when I was in science, the door was open and the same type of ambulance that took my daddy away sat in front of a house and the sirens would not stop.  They made me kind of down.  I remember when I got called out of social studies to hear the news.  I already knew it.  The principal Miss Wetzel, was so understanding.  She was the best principal I ever had.  After a while, I quieted down, and I felt strong enough that I could get me bag out of the room, but once I saw Deacon, the teacher, I burst out crying again.  Whenever I saw him, I saw what my dad was, a kind man with children.  My sister didn\'t cry at all at school, but when my half-brother Scott came and picked her up she did.',4,-5,0,1,5,0,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,9.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.36,0,0,0,5.9,0,0,0,4.72,0,0,0,2.36,0,0,1.18,0,17.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.05,0,0,5.9,0,0,0,4.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.08,15.35,0,2.36,0,0,0,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.72,0,0,2.36,Female51

'When my father went to Africa he stayed with a man named Nedu.  Nedu got a job in the United States for a year and came to stay with us sometimes but he only stayed for the weekend and then went back to Nevada.  I knew that he was going to leave but never thought about it much until he was actually leaving that day.  I was very upset.  I cried for a long time wanting him to come back.  we had a youth pastor at a church and I was pretty close to him.  In fact I loved him to death.  Everyone did.  The only problem is that he was an intern and had to leave after the summer was over.  We threw him a going away party with cake and presents.  It was a lot of fun.  Some people even made a video about him.  The party was the best.  When he cut the cake he cut out a heart for the youth group that he loved.  Everyone cried.  Cory is coming to visit on holidays because his family is here so we will get to see him but only once because he has to return to college.  I was in the second grad and about eight years old when my dog died.  She was only four years old and her kidneys failed.  She slowly got sicker and sicker until she could barley move.  My dad took her to the vet to be put to sleep.  We paid to have her buried in a dog graveyard and have a tree planted in her name.  For hours and hours I cried for her.  Everything reminded me of her.Once one of my friends who lived in my neighborhood had to move away.  Her dad had gotten a new job in Florida because he was laid off from work.  She was the only one my age in the neighborhood that I knew of.  We were best friends and always spent time together.  We told each other a lot of stuff.  Her name was Jenny Bush.  Although we didn\'t go to the same school we met when she moved in.  We do not have many kids my age in the neighborhood that I know and talk to.  Everyday after school I would run to her house or she would run to mine and we would go out and ride bikes.  About once a week we would go to the seven-eleven on the corner of two main roads about six or seven blocks away.  Every time we would either get a slurrpy or a drink and a package or two of candy.  Jenny lived up the street from me for about a year.  We were good friends.  When I found out that she was moving I was so upset.  I helped Jenny\'s family pack up the house and we threw her a going away party.  I was with her until the very last minute.When I found out that my grandmother had cancer I was very upset.  I was also scared.  My mom said that it was no big deal because it was curable, but she had cancer five years before and so I did not know what to think.  As time progressed she got worse and worse.  The cancer was spreading and she was always tired.  My grandmother was taken to the hospital a lot and usually stayed for a few days.  My mother was gone a lot because my grandmother lives in Pennsylvania and my mom was staying with my grandfather.  My grandmother got her cancer in July second by May she was told that she had six weeks to live.  At mother\'s day we went to see her.  She was in the hospital.  My mom stayed with her for two weeks and then came home.  The night that she got back we got a call that my grandma had died.  I was very sad and I cried and cried.  The next week we went to the funeral.  We were all very upset.  A few weeks later we found out that my grandfather had to have cataract surgery.  The surgery went well but they took him off of his heart medicine for about twenty days.  That caused him to have a heart attack.  He called 911 and got to the hospital in time.  The heart attack was mild and he was fine.  The only problem was that he had to have open heart surgery.  The surgery went well but then he got pneumonia while he was in the hospital.  That caused him to be there even longer.',4,-5,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0,10.4,0,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,16.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.8,0,0,10.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,3.9,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,Female51

I have not seen her in a long time I will enjoy seeing her.  When we win I will be happy.\tWhen I woke up this morning I laid in bed and thought about winning the semi- finals.  We were going to play in a championship against another Prince of Peace team.  When I got out of bed I went and got the newspaper.  I finished my report on the election by coloring in the states that voted for which candidate.  I ate my breakfast in silence.  It was eggs with sausage.  I drank three glasses of orange juice. I love orange juice.  I left the kitchen and brushed my teeth.  I fed my dogs and got my dress uniform shirt.  In my room I got dressed quickly.  I spent a while brushing my hair.  Then my dad called.  I talked to him about my report.  He told me he left me a map.  I hung up the phone and went around the house picking up my school books and papers.  I took them to my room and packed my school bag.  I grabbed my house key and went outside I jumped rope until my mom came out.  My brother, me, and my mom got in the car and drove to school.  When I got there we climbed out of the car and went to our classrooms.  I unpacked my stuff and put the rest in my locker.  I organized my stuff and took my seat.  I read for five minutes.  Then my teacher told us it was time to go to chapel.   We lined up.  I was first.  We walked to chapel and took our seats.  We had our chapel lesson and sang songs!  When chapel was over we came back.  We wrote down two long Bible verses.  We graded two math papers.  On the first one I missed two.  On the second I missed one.  I don\'t like making corrections but I did any way.  I read in my book for a while then drew pictures. I then started to color my friend drew.  I like to color!  Then the lady from SMU came in.

'There was this girl named Back pack. She had the biggest house on the block. Everything was going perfect. Then at one point her Dad stopped coming home as much. Sometimes he would not come home at all. So he would be gone about three days. In that time period her mom told her that her dad was on drugs and they were getting a divorce. That literally broke the girl up but Backpack never cried. She had a younger sister she had to stay strong for. Her brother never cried he would just talk things out with  his mom. they lived with family members before they  found their own apartment. They would go with our lights being off for weeks at a time. Nut then things got better. We moved in a three bedroom spacious apartment. We were doing just fine. But she still have not seen my dad in a month. She sees him about once a month or maybe a couple of moths. Backpack really keeps all her thoughts, emotions, and feeling balled up insideThere once was a little girl named May. Her sister and her were playing under an iron board with no shirts on. (The sister was two or three and May was five or six.) Any ways, their mom kept telling them to put a shirt on. They didn\'t listen. May shook the ironing board and the hot iron fell on May\'s stomach. Her mom rushed up and took the iron off May. You could see the burned skin, and the intestines. This was excruciating pain. She had to wear a bandage that covered most of her stomach. That was a sad day. There once was this boy named Jamal. One day he got a message that his  uncle was in the hospital and had ammonia. So him, his mom , and two sisters drove out to Arlington Hospital. He saw him he had a lot of machines hooked up to him but he didn\'t look that bad. Then Jamal gave him a hug and left.

'\"Mary, come quick!\"  \"Why?\"  \"There is something on the porch.\"  \"What?\"  \"Just come and look!\"  Skylar leaped down the stairs to see the something.  She opened the door and to her surprise, there was her mother on the front porch with a rabbit in her arms.  \"Where did you find it!\"  \"It was just there when I opened the door!\"  Skylar looked at the beautifully white albino rabbit.  She raced into the house to get the carrots that had been for dinner last night.  When she came back the rabbit loved the carrots.  In fact, the rabbits ate a whole bag of long carrots.  A couple of days passed, Skylar had put up \"Found: white rabbit.  Call.\"  Then one night, two days later, Skylar\'s mother rushed up.  \"Skylar, there is something wrong with BB!\"  \"What?\"  \"I don\'t know!\"  When Skylar saw the rabbit, she almost burst out crying.  BB lay on the ground breathing heavily and on her leg, an open wound.  It\'s perimeter was at least four inches and you could see the bone.  BB in the morning was very sick still.  Skylar\'s mom decided to take BB to the Humane Society.Jessica was two years old.  She was a very cute little kid.  Jessica also had two older siblings; a brother, four, and a sister, six.  One day, Jessica was outside playing on her teeter-totter.  Her brother, Luis, was not very smart.  He was running down the yard hitting a hand shovel at the fence.  Suddenly, he turned around, aimed, and threw the shovel at Jessica.  It hit her in the back of the head diagonally.  She started screaming because she was wearing her party dress and was getting blood all over it!  She ran into the house where her grandpa was watching television and her grandma was sleeping.  He took one look at her and started to clean her up.  Her parents weren\'t at the house at the time, but when they did, they took, her straight to the emergency room.  Jessica had hair that had been cut off by the shovel, and of course, twenty stitches.Anyway:  Skylar\'s mother saw BB and she knew what she had to do.  \"Skylar, come downstairs please!\"  Skylar bound down the stairs, wondering if her rabbit had died.  \"Did she die?\"  \"No, not yet.\"  \"What are we going to do?\"  \"Get dressed, we\'ll take her down to the Humane Society and have her put to sleep.\"  Two hours later, \"Mom, do you think she could have lived with help?\"  \"I don\'t really know, Skylar.\"  Now, Skylar only has one souvenir of her BB; a stuffed rabbit with a carrot under an arm.  One day, a girl named Meleese asked her mother if they could get doughnuts on their way to school.  Her mother agreed.  \"Did they have everything we wanted, Mom?\"  \"They sure did.\"  Meleese\'s mother started the car and pulled to the back alley of the shopping center and started down it.  When they came to the end of the alleyway, Meleese\'s mother looked both ways and started to go around McDonalds.  Than as if in slow motion, Meleese saw a car coming towards them.  \"Mom, look out!\"  The huge white suburban knocked them off the road into a field.  The man in the car jumped out of the car, screaming like a maniac.  \"Great, why did a jerk have to hit me?\"',4,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.48,Female51
'I had a friend in fourth grade who was a really good friend.  I though of her like that until the middle of seventh grade.  She really began to change.  Puberty took over.  She started acting like she could do anything she wanted to, whether it hurt other people or not.  All she talked about was these really freaky friends of hers who I really didn\'t like.  The were guys.  I mean, not that I don\'t like guys, but these in particular were the kind of \"go for sex\" guys.  It was around Thanksgiving that she really blew it with me.  She told one of the guys I would go out with him.  That made me about as mad as I\'ve ever been.  He started to call me all the time, and wouldn\'t leave me alone.  I started to wish I had never even met this girl.  At times I just wished she\'d disappear.  She had no clue how mad I was.  She kept on calling me, talking to me, and inviting me places with these guys.  I tried as hard as I could to just ignore her.  Then I blew through.  I didn\'t want to ever hear my \"boyfriend\'s\" voice or her voice again.  I wrote her a really mean letter telling her exactly what I thought of her, which isn\'t appropriate to put on this page.  After I wrote the letter, I found out the only reason she wanted me to get close to that one guy was to get his cousin.  I decided she deserved the silent treatment for eternity.  She would call and I\'d hang up on her.  The biggest fit I had was when she\'d call.The girl and I are on okay terms now.  I\'m still mad, but I don\'t talk about her too much.  At the beginning of this year I was really glad I wasn\'t good friends with her.  She worshipped movies like \"The Craft\" and \"The Crow:  City of Angels.\"  She wore this necklace everywhere that she said was a symbol of witchcraft.  She did stupid stuff like seances, etceteras.  I was glad I wasn\'t friends with someone who tried to get attention my pretending she had something to do with witchcraft.  The other girl I talked about yesterday, the one who said she didn\'t like the girl, kind of got involved with the witchcraft, but it passed quickly.  I felt really bad for both of them, and I actually prayed to God about it, which I seldom do.  I asked him to help her stop the stupid witchcraft junk she thought she was doing.  I never really think she was serious.  She just wanted attention.  Although, she stopped going to church and taking communion at school masses.  She got over witchcraft, but she still doesn\'t go to mass I wish she would sometimes I just want to help her straighten out her life.  She\'s still obsessed with \"The Crow.\"  That\'s what she dressed up for Halloween as.  My first thought was how stupid can she get?  Oh well, doesn\'t really matter.  We talk to each other, but not on the phone.  I\'m glad we don\'t really hate each other hating someone makes me feel weird inside.  I rather be a good terms with everyone.  I\'ve always wondered how she felt during this.  I mean, how did she look a me during this period of time?  I don\'t think it really matters now.After the letter, we completely ignored each other.  Everyone knew we were on bad terms, but they didn\'t really know why.  I only really told my best friend the real truth.  She went her way and I went mine.  She made a couple of friends, but I felt a little guilty because I stayed with the rest of out groups.  The guy kept calling me, but I knew he wasn\'t a good guy, so I kept hanging up on him.  I started to get kind of depressed.  I\'d lost one of my friends, and this idiotic guy wouldn\'t stop bugging me.  Once when I was in a really bad mood I wrote the girl a letter.  I was at the library and three other girls helped me.  It was really mean.  One of the girls typed it.  They all hated the girl for the same reason.  They had the impression that she\'d used them to get a guy, etceteras.  One girl stuck it in her locker.  We went to math that morning.  She was crying.  That\'s when I decided to give her a little leeway.  I\'d just ignore her, and not be mean, which I thought was pretty nice of me.  Sometimes we\'d have times when we\'d talk about each other behind our backs, but that was life.  I had no intention of being her friend again.  I mean, she told a guy I would go out with him just to get to another guy.  She made me feel depressed about loosing her, and angry.  I don\'t even think I would\'ve minded about the guy if she wouldn\'t have ignored me about it.  There were some times when I would have to talk to her, school projects,.  That I couldn\'t help.  But otherwise, I pretended she didn\'t exist, which is the same she did tome.  One of these girls who said they didn\'t\' like her really started to me off during this past summer.  She would talk about her all the time, and then go off and be her best friend.

'We one time were playing outside and decided to have a cheerleading.  Instead of having one we had to have two.  Why?  Because some people were enemies.  I mean enemies!  So we were apart and we all had leaders every week.  But the other group didn\'t like that.  So we got in this very huge fight.  It was like a war.  We had it for two months !  Over!  And the teachers kept on talking to us for twenty minutes saying you need to get along.  Well that didn\'t work so one day we tried to work things out with the other group but no.  They weren\'t just the only ones.   We were doing it too.  So one day Miss Hayes, very mean teacher, talked to both of the head leaders and she said to play a game together.  And from that day forward we were all best friends.  My friends when we get in a fight we stay like that for at least two days.  My friends call me names like beep, beep you\'re a beep, beep.  But that meant they\'re not my friend.  So I pick new friends.  My sister did the same things but that was her job.  I didn\'t turn in my papers today.  So I was pretty upset because you get a zero for that subject.  Last year.  I was taking a spelling test, we always have a bonus.  And the bonus card was still up there.  But I know it.  So on the fifth word she walked around and put a pink thing on my paper.  Then after the test she called for the other people who did that too!  And then said \"You cheated.\"  I was so surprised and very upset!  Why?  Because I didn\'t\' even spell the bonus right!  I still had to write a letter to my parent.  So I did I told them all them about the story.  I took it to Miss Hayes.  She said never include me in this letter!  Or any one!  She said.  I said I hate you!  You\'re so irresponsible!  She said that wasn\'t\' a letter.  She said then you\'re having trouble in English.  Then it was lunch.  Then she wanted to talk about the spelling thing again after lunch.  She said you did a feline!  I didn\'t even know what that was.  But I just played along.  She said, while I was crying, \"I don\'t really hate that much  But I want to say I\'m sorry.  My.\"Yesterday I was doing math with my mom.  I was counting.  She thought I was piddling.   Then we got in a big fight.  She started to hit me and then spanking me.  Then she started to call me names and of course I was crying.  Then I wrote on my paper:  I hat you!  I\'m embarrassed to be your.\"  It felt good then but know I really feel bad about that.  And I didn\'t practice my piano.  She said, since I have a test the nest day, \"You have better make a good grade on that paper! \"  I said the lowest is going to be a \"B plus.\"  I hope I\'m right.  But we still haven\'t taken the test yet.  It was a raining Saturday.  I spent the night at my friend\'s house well my dad and mom picked me up thirty minutes early.

'When she said I was ignoring her, I got mad all over again.  I left and started to dance with this guy.  That made her mad.  I do not remember how we made up.  What I really hate is when I haven\'t been using the phone like all week and I call somebody once my mom and dad start yelling at me.  Like a couple of days ago.  I got on the phone, my mom got it and said that I was grounded from the phone.  There was this one time when my friend, Jon, got mad at me because I said something that offended him highly.  He was so mad at me that he hung up on me and refused to speak to me for three weeks.  I called him after the first week and started to apologize.  He just shrugged it off and said he had to go clean up his house.  Finally after the third week he started to talk to me again and even hugged me every time he saw me.  He is in VFC.  It is sort of a custom to hug your friend.  Boy or girl.  I really cannot express any of my feelings.  I can not think of anything else to say. I just hate it when people start teasing me and my guy friends.  They are just my friends, yet everyone seems to think more of it.  Like we like each other or something.  Okay.One of the most upsetting things that ever happened to me is when we were having our patio built.  Me and my little sister were playing and I got sawdust in her hair.  My parents got really mad at me and started yelling at me.  They started to hit me and demand that I get that saw dust out of her hair or else.  I really hated them at that time.  Another time is when I got mad at my best friend.  I had invited her to my youth group dance and then she embarrassed me in front of all my friends by making me fall.  I got really mad and ignored her.  She kept coming to me and said I\'m sorry it was an accident when she even told me she was going to let me fall.  She got the whole youth group and my parents and my friends into it.  They, my parents, started yelling at me again.  I ran outside crying and started screaming in frustration because she was making this fight everybody\'s business.  I really wanted to hate her forever because my parents got real mad at me.   Then my friend came.  He asked me to dance and I felt better.  My other friend, he asked me what was wrong and when I told him, he gave me a hug and gave me some advice.  He made me feel so much better.  The only thing that I hated was that my parents kept bugging me about it.  They just couldn\'t leave me alone.  Then I tried being nice to my best friend and she just went outside to go to sleep.  That made me furious!  Then she accused me of ignoring her.Something that highly upsets me is when my friend gets really annoying.  She\'ll call my little sister to come where we are sitting.  Then, she\'ll ignore me and say things to my sister.  It makes me very annoyed and mad.  So I leave.  Then she says that she is sorry, etceteras.  I hate it when I get bad grades.  My parents get mad if I get a \"C.\"  It is pressure.  I get tired of hearing things like \"You used to do so well\" or \"I know you can do so much better.\"  I try to do my best, but always land up short!  I \'m not very good at describing my feelings.  Anyway, I guess I\'m really not under a lot of stress because I seem to have run out of what to say.  I hate making sandwiches I have to make them everyday because my sister is very lazy when it comes to chores.  I also have doing laundry and dishes.  I have to do laundry every week and dishes every other night.

'Something upsetting that I have told some friends but not my family is well one day when I was with my boyfriend at sunset because he was waiting for me there because me and my friends ride the school bus and when Ii go there we were just talking and we started playing around and he accidentally punched me but I did not pay no attention to it because it did not hurt and Ii thought it would just get red but when I got home and changed my clothes and I saw that I was getting this bruise on my arm I called my boyfriend and told him and he was surprised. well anywise my parents didn\'t see it until couple of days later they asked me what happened. I couldn\'t tell them the truth because then they would think wrong about my boyfriend so I lied to them and I was upset because I lied to my parents and I usually do not lie too my parents. So I felt upset, sad and disappointed and up to this day they don\'t know. Well the bruise on my arm for almost two weeks but the funny thing is that the reason why I think I got the bruise was because I had hit my arm on a door here at school so he punched me in the same arm so that is why I think I got the bruise. The lie I told my parents well it was not really lie because I told them that I hit my arm on a door so that was part of what happened.I think I finished with the other thing but now something just happened this weekend well me and my boyfriend broke up and my mom loved him but one day he got mad at me and was telling me things well I hung up on him he called back and me and my mom answered the phone he told me a curse word and my mom got mad so she said she didn\'t want me with him. So I went out all weekend Friday I went to a teen club Saturday I went to Six Flags and Sunday to the Fair. I thought if I would go out I would go out I would not think of him but no I would just think about him. I was with him  for a year and couple of weeks so I\'m like so used to him so I called him yesterday from the fair then I called him when I got home. My mom asked me why did I call him and I said because I wanted to so my mm got mad so that got me so upset but I really like him and I know he disrespects me but he was sorry and I know I\'m young and older people usually say that we are too young to like or love someone but I really like him so I\'m so depressed, confused and don\'t know what to do so what do you think I should do please give me some advice. But I also think that they should just let me talk to him I don\'t like when my parents are mad because they are so nice to me but I still don\'t know what to do. Mostly all last night I was crying my mom was at work so I guess she was mad but I just stayed in my room listen to the radio or just lay down and cry.Last time I wrote about problems with my boyfriend. Well I talked to him on the phone my parents let me we are just friends. I have no idea if we will go out again. One time when I was in the seventh grade a lot of girls did not like me because people told me that they were jealous of me well one day at lunch some eighth grader came up to me and said that some girls told her that I called her a female dog well I did not even know her so I was like that is stupid because I do not even know you. Well she tried to start a fight with me but she didn\'t. This is something else in eighth grade when I was going with that guy that I was telling you about well a couple of other girls liked him well they knew that I was kind of a jealous person so they would tell me all these lies about my boyfriend and I would hate it so I would fell so upset and back then everyone told me that I was the kind of person that go mad quick well I kind of did once in a while it depended on what it was. Well anyway girls would always get me mad and tell me a lot of things I really hated that I just felt like punching every single girl that would tell me things about him. Now I am going to tell you how I usually feel most of the time. Well whenever someone gets me mad I am in a bad mood sometimes I even feel like crying. I am the kind f person that cries easily whenever someone gets me mad or when they tell me something that hurts see I had a sister that passed away in August of ninety three and since then I am not the same she died of Leukemia it was cancer and the sad thing about it was that she got married and died the next day.',4,-5,0,1,5,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.15,2.1,0,0,0,6.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.15,0,0,0,9.46,4.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.15,0,0,0,0,30.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.21,0,38.88,0,0,9.46,0,0,0,0,0,4.21,0,0,0,0,0,13.66,8.4,0,3.15,4.21,0,7.36,0,0,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'Another highly upsetting experience was when I learned that my best friend was going away.  She was really someone I could go and talk to.  I met her at my church\'s youth group.  She was here from Loveland, Colorado as a summer intern.  I went to camp at Trinity, Texas with her.  She ended up being my counselor for five whole days!  At first I was very reluctant to make friends with her because I knew she was only going to be here for the summer.   Inside I was yelling make friends, make friends, I really didn\'t want to have to go through the pain of losing her.  Finally I made friends with her.  She is the most awesome person I ever met.  When I was told she was leaving I cried my heart out!  Turns out she didn\'t leave after all.  She is the most awesome person I know.The most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me was probably when my father died in 1994.  I used to think it was my fault because after my parents had me and my sister (we\'re twins) they divorced.  After that when I got older I wanted to know things and I started asking questions to my mother.  Lot of the times she would shrug it off and say \"why to you want to know all this for now.\"  I\'d say because he was my father and I felt I had a right to know.  When I found out he had died it was my pastor telling me and my mother just sat there.  Pastor told me he died of a heart attack.  Ever since then I really wanted my father back.  I know that is not possible unless God does that and why would he for one person when so many people have died before him.  Every now and then I wish I could know whether or not he went to heaven or hell.  I knew him but not that close.  I know I knew him enough for it to hurt when died.  I just wish I could talk to him one more time or write a letter to him.  Just anything to talk to him or see him.  He died four years after I had seen him last and two years since I talked to him on the phone.  I remember he called me on my eighth birthday.  I don\'t see why it had to be him.  What did I do to deserve this?  It\'s not fair in my sight.  My mom won\'t remarry either.  I even wish my twenty-eight and thirty year old brothers lived closer.  In the past two years they kind of were my father when I saw or talked to them.  But I don\'t very often.  My dad used to call me his \"sweet little cookie.\"  I truly miss him.  Why did he have to die.  Things would be better now if he was still alive.Another upsetting topic in my life was when I was around ten years old.  My family moved across town.  All my life I\'ve gone to the same school.  For five years I made friends with the people there.  I had even a boyfriend there.  I had gotten to know my neighborhood well.  then we moved!  I begged and begged my mom not to move.  She didn\'t listen to me.  Of course parents never listen!  I remember the weekend we moved.  It was a Saturday in July.  It poured down rain that day.  It was miserable.  My first friend was the tiniest little frog I found on my driveway.  He was so cute!  I soon realized there weren\'t many kids in my neighborhood my age.  Nor were there many girls.  I became better friends with a girl named Amy who is sixteen and has a very mixed up life.  I still to this day can plainly describe my old house.  After two years I don\'t truly love my new house.  I could have the chance I\'d move back to my old house in a hot second.  My mom might not be so anxious but I know I would.  My old house had three bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, a dining room and a den.  My new house all of the above except it has four bedrooms and more closets and a wet bar.  My new house is about thirty-five minutes away from my old house.',3,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.67,0,0,0,0,2.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.67,4.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.36,0,0,6.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.34,Female51
'\tAnother time was when me and my brother were fighting.  It all started when we were playing a video games.  It was my turn to play, but my brother had to make up and he took the video game from me.  I took it away from him.  He started to hit me.  I hit him back.  He punched me.  I ran he kept on hurting me.  I didn\'t like it.  But I thought it was fun so I started to laugh, then my brother slapped me I was angry he make me so mad.  Even though he is four but now five.

When my mom was gone I looked inside my sister\'s lunch box.  She got really mad at me. So she stomped on my belt buckle.  I was smashed and I got really mad at her.

Turned on my television watched cartoons and put on my clothes. Next I went in the bathroom and curled my hair. Then I went to watch more cartoons and a little while later I go and get myself something to eat. I always like to get something to eat first before brushing my teeth. Then I got my back pack, turned off my curlers, television, light, ceiling fan, and lights around the house. Then when everything is turned off I go and brush my teeth so when I get finished I can leave. I turn on my alarm and leave out the door and lock it. Then my sister, mother and me drive to get to school, but me and my sister get dropped off to one of our friends house because it to early to get to school.

'I ran out the door and sat on the grassy bank.  I couldn\'t believe it that I can\'t be the dog.  The teacher came out to me and said to me you always be what you want.  But still I said I want to be the dog.  But you know what said the teacher.  What?  I said. You could be the cat.  But I don\'t want to be the cat.  Cats are not my favorite animal.  But you have to be something in the play the teacher said.  What can I be but not the cat.  You could be the raccoon, lion or the other.It was time that my art class was having a play about a cat and dog where friends.  We each got to pick what we wanted to be in the play.  I wanted to be the dog but someone took what I wanted to be so I started to beg the art teacher by saying please may I be the dog?  I asked and begged but she said I have to be something but not the dog.  What!  I exclaimed I can\'t be the dog!  I was so heart broken.  I ran out the classroom door and sat on the grassy and tall hill.  I was so heart broken I started to weep and cry.\tThe teacher said I could be something but not the dog.  She said I could be the raccoon, squirrel, frog, cat or cow and mouse.  And decided to think about it. So I thought and thought, hmm, what should I be in the play?  But when I got up the teacher raced to me and said or you can be the bunny or the robin.  I jumped up and said I\'ve made up my mind I want to be the bunny I said.

We are reading a novel and probably getting homework and we might be able to work on it.   After school I am going to basketball practice.  We will run, stretch, shoot hoops, suicides, laps, and other fun things like relay races, pacing games, and learning positions!  After practice my mom will pick me up and we will go home.

My mom might tell me to go take a shower and then do my homework or she might even say to do your homework and take a shower.  Usually it\'s go take a shower first!  I hate showers.  But I love the smell of my shampoo!  That\'s the only reason for washing my hair.  I take really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really hot showers.  Just thought I\'d share that.  It\'s when I get to homework that I get very mad!  Our teachers are so strict about homework!  They give us so much!  I hate it and I bet I can list so many other people who would most absolutely positively agree with me more than half the time!  Or even ten thousand quadrillions of the time, just so far this year!  Don\'t you remember how hard homework is!

'\tRachel was heartbroken.  She didn\'t know what to think.  Her father was still in England and her grandmother lived 2 hours away!  The funeral was scheduled for Friday the first of November 1996.  Rachel\'s grandmother cried a lot while they were there.  Rachel had never seen her cry before, and at the funeral her dad burst into tears. But later on at the funeral she found out why.  Later when they saw her grandfather for the last time she cried too.  She realized she wouldn\'t see her grandfather for a long time, not until heaven.  If that is where he is.  She thought about all he\'d done and everything she remembered about him.  She really missed him a whole lot!  The funeral was beautiful.  Her dad sang two songs and the boy scouts said their pledge.  Then they all went to the grave yard and they talked some more.  Rachel could tell it was hard for her grandmother to let him go, it was hard for her too.\tEverything happened so fast.  He came and then he went.  Rachel didn\'t know him that well and she wished she could have, he seemed like a great man.  Very friendly and kind. She wished so much that he was alive.  She missed him.  A 73\% I couldn\'t believe it.  I got a D on a math test.  I felt like crying, and inside I did.  That night when I went home I was lying in bed when I started crying.  I cried and cried for half an hour, nobody heard me.  I thought, maybe nobody cares?  Maybe they\'re deaf?  Finally my parents heard me they came upstairs and talked with me.  Then they said goodnight, hugged me and I fell asleep.  I was so worried that I would fail math.  A test counts 4 times!  It would take me a month of A pluses to bring it back to an A minus.  I was so worried I would never be able to do it. My parents helped a lot they told me that I could do it and that it would only take hard work.  \tIt was a rainy Saturday afternoon.  Rachel was at home reading.  She was sitting on the sofa reading her favorite book for the fourth time.  Her mom walked by on the phone.  She said that Rachel\'s dad was going to be out of the country for two weeks.  12 days later Rachel was in bed waiting for her mom to come say goodnight to her.  Her mom climbed the stairs with the phone in her hand.  Just as she walked in the phone rang.  It was Rachel\'s grandmother.  Her mom answered the phone and a few seconds later said \"Oh! No!\"  Rachel didn\'t know what to think.  She thought of a thousand things that could have happened.  Maybe her dad was hurt, maybe killed?  A few minutes later her mom got off the phone.  She told Rachel that her grandfather had died.  Rachel didn\'t know what to say.

The know got tighter and tighter then when she was alone, it disappeared!  But when she got into another argument, it came back, just as worse.  She didn\'t know how to stop it.  Her attitude seemed to get crankier and crankier.  She thought that maybe if she didn\'t get into many fights, then maybe, just maybe the knot would stop.  She tried this experiment.  It worked!

I clean the house as much I could. I thought the house was very neat clean. My mom such came home and said you have not cleaned. I got so mad that I started talking back to her. Instead of telling me that I have not clean she could of told me that you forgot a spot or let me show you how to do it. That time that she told me that I have not even touch the broom or the cleaning spot. The think that gets me mad that my mom said that I do not know how to do things.I do not have nothing else to say. But I wish my problems with my mom work out. I do not know my mom has to lie but probably she does not want to hurt my feelings. But she is hurting my feelings my lying to me. Sometimes she blames me of something she has done and she had forgotten about it.One thing that upsets me a lot with my mom is that she lies too much that she has to lie for everything she see wrong or she thinks she knows everything. I think I have a problem with my mom but I don\'t know what. I hate myself because I feel that I don\'t trust my mom on everything she tells me. My mom supposed to be like my best friend. Like a week ago I told my mom that I didn\'t trust her. She got very mad at me.',2,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.4,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.6,0,0,0,0,0,6.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'I finished what I was writing about now, another upsetting thing that my brother married my best friend without telling no one! I was so mad at my so called sister in law. Well as you know in my religion you have to marry the person you get involved with. She ended up pregnant, and now my family, and her family hate each other. We talk about once every five months, but other than that we do not talk at all! The baby is now seven months and she is really cute! But I really do not get to see her now because I do not like my brother\'s wife, and somy life goes on hoping I do not make that mistake.One of the most upsetting things that has happened to me is losing my virginity to my friend. It started all out when we had our semester exams and we got out early that day. He decided to come over se Ii thought it was cool. So we walked to my house and we put a movie on. He was sitting next to me. Then he started to grab me and one thing led to another and I did it. It upsets me now because he was my friend and I knew I was doing something very wrong. But there is something else also. I belong to a religion called the Jehovah Witness. I cannot celebrate anything or go out with any of my worldly friends.  So supposedly I have to get married or talk to a guy who is only in that religion. And I am not supposed to lose my virginity until I marry that guy. So I knew what the consequences were going to be if Ii did it. But I still did it. So time passed by and I needed to do everything by myself. I could not tell my family because I was so afraid and scared. So I had to pay and Ii got my money and I went to my school clinic. They got me a file and then they gave me a pregnancy test. I took it and then a counselor came in and talked to me. I waited for about twenty five to thirty minutes and finally the results came. Luckily, it came out negative. I was so relieved. I did not know what to say. So I went home and some of my worldly friends know about it but not my family. So now it is almost going to be a year now and Ii still have my conscious on it. I thinkWell that\'s all I had to say about that issue. Now, I am doing pretty well but I have come close to doing it again. But I follow my instincts, and I think about what is going to happen all at once and I say no. I know that is the right think to say and I feel good about it. But once I liked this guy so much and he wanted to do it but I knew I had to say no. I did and now I am here. Just going on with my life with that devastating ugly thought in my mind of doing it with my friend. I totally regret it and I totally wish I could erase the past and start from the beginning. I almost lost my best friend because her boyfriend came on to me. But I never told her. I  have so many problems and thoughts in my mind that I don\'t know what to do. I\'m trying to stay out of trouble because last year I had a parole officer and I don\'t want one again. So that was my upsetting experience that I experienced. And I think that one takes up for about five of them!',3,-5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.1,0,0,9.3,0,0,0,3.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,21.7,0,1.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.8,0,0,9.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.2,3.1,0,0,0,0,3.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51
'The Tattletale.  My upsetting moment is when my sister named Ogaboga (Robyn) really had a horrible day.  She came into the kitchen and said \"gimmie something to eat!\" \"No!\" I said to her.  \"I want some candy and chips, apples, all kinds of stuff.\"  Mom, Ogaboga is having another horrible day!\"  I told my mom \"Ogaboga you have to go see mom in the bathroom.\"  I told her.  So Ogaboga went in the bathroom and came out with a bag of candy.  \"Ogaboga what are you doing with that bag of candy?\"  I asked.  \"Mom gave it to me because I told the truth.\" she boasted \"I tell the truth.\"  I said back to Ogaboga.  \"Well, mom said you don\'t.\"  Well I do, how does she know I don\'t tell the truth?\"  \"Because remember that time you told me you don\'t tell the truth?\" she\'d ask me \"No I don\'t\" I\'d tell her back.  \"Mom, how come Ogaboga got a bag of candy.\"\tBad thing.  I have another friend named Jordan Montaya.  She is fun and exciting.  But there is only one problem my other friend Carolyn doesn\'t like her.  I try to be as nice as I possibly can to Jordan.  Carolyn keeps on telling secrets about her.  It really bugs me because I like Jordan and she doesn\'t.  Jordan\'s deepest feelings are that she is really upset about this secret stuff.  I feel the same way.  To tell you the truth, Jordan doesn\'t really like Carolyn, I think.  I think that because I could be furious about the secrets and stuff.  So maybe she is the same way Carolyn says she gets mad at Jordan a lot.  She kind of bothers me too sometimes but not as much as Carolyn.  I keep on asking Carolyn if she is still mad at Jordan.  She said \"Yes!\"  In a tone of voice.  So one day in Spanish class we all got back together.  So now Jordan and Carolyn and I are all friends.  And I hope it stays that way all the time.  I don\'t know if Jordan is still mad at Carolyn or not.  I hope not!  The end.  Post script Jordan doesn\'t bother me as much anymore.\tThere was a friend named Carolyn Gill. She is my best friend.  One day I had to go to school and Carolyn didn\'t come.  \"Miss Poole, how come Carolyn is not here?\"  \"I don\'t know.\"  She said not excitedly.  \"Can I go see if she is here?\"  I asked \"No.\"  So the day went on with out Carolyn.  Then at the last moment Carolyn came.  \"Carolyn, why were you gone?\" I asked her surprised.  \"I was here, I was just in the bathroom.\"  She told me like I was dumb.  \"Oh,\" I thought you were gone.\" \"I wasn\'t gone I was in the bathroom!\"  She yelled at me.  Well, the day wasn\'t normal she kept on looking at me like  I was dumb or something.  Well, I kind of think I was dumb because I knew she was here, because I saw her in the halls walking around trying to find a bathroom!  So I knew I saw her here before.  So I am dumb.  When it was time to leave, Carolyn asked me if I would like to come over and play at her house.  I told her \"I\'ll ask.\"  I went to ask my mom if \"I could go over to Carolyn\'s house and play?\"',3,-4,0,1,5,0,6.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.1,0,0,0,5.05,0,0,0,6.73,0,0,0,5.05,0,0,0,0,21.88,0,6.73,0,3.37,0,0,0,0,37.03,0,0,5.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.1,15.15,0,6.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female51

'One time, at my other school Owens, I was chasing this boy.  I don\'t know why but anyway he was climbing up these poles.  I tried to move my hand, but I couldn\'t.  I grabbed on to his pants, shorts, I tried to let go before he started going up the poles, but he moved up.  So after his pants fell down, I said \"Oh Paul!  I\'m so sorry!\"  He forgave me and all, but I think it was more embarrassing for me than it was him.  I got so mad and sad because for one thing, I must have embarrassed him, and two, my dad was the school board president for my school, Owens.  So I kept it a secret for a few nights and days, then one night I had to tell him, so I did.  I was crying like crazy when I asked him if I would get kicked out or not.  He said no.  I felt a little better, but I was still sad about Paul.  I hope he still forgives me.  And I hope someday I will forgive myself.  But still in my prayers, I remember how sad I was and him like it was yesterday.  Well, actually, I don\'t think Paul cares as much as I do, because he thought he was a teacher, so I came back the day after the accident, and no one acted like it even happened.   I\'m glad Paul forgave me, and I hope he forgot all about it.  He was my good friend.  Sometimes I get really mad at my sister.  This one day, me, my mom, and LeeAnn my sister were in the car driving somewhere, I don\'t know where, but she made me so mad.I joined this soccer team named the Blue Ice. That\'s how my team spells blue.  The bad thing is they are really good players, and I\'m only starting.  They have also been together since they were like three or four years old.  The coach thinks I\'m good for a beginner, but I don\'t think I fit in.  Everyone on the team know defense and offense as well as math well I know defense and offense too, but not as well as them.  Some people on the team are really nice, but some steal the ball from me, when they\'re on my team.  The best player is probably Krisy.  She plays awesome for the wing and goalie.  I\'m the best at defender, but the defender positions the really boring.  We haven\'t lost a game yet, but people have scored on us.  Onetime, I almost made a goal, but the other teams goalie got her head on the ball right when I was about to kick it.  There is this other new kid on the team.  Her name is Whitney. She\'s pretty nice, but she is the one stealing the ball from me.  Actually, she only stole the ball from me once, but I was about to make a goal, when she mad a goal.  But anyway.Yesterday I was talking I know you may think \"So what\" but I was talking a lot.  The bad thing is, is that I was talking to my friend Katie while a guest speaker was talking.  I tied to be quiet, but everything she said I had to make a comment about.  I didn\'t say anything mean, but I was still talking.  I felt really bad because I think I set a bad example on the forth grade.  But  I hope she can come back, so I can set a better example on the forth grade that what I did.  I was mostly talking when someone had a question I was just whispering!  I told my parents but they just said stuff like \"What\'s the problem?\"  I just said \"I guess I\'m just hyper!\"  The bad thing is about my parents what they did for my punishment since I said that I thought I was just hyper, I cant\' have any, I mean any, more candy at school for my lunch, in my lunch.

It was a hysterectomy.  They thought that it might be cancer.  Luckily it was only a tumor.  Before the operation she had lots of tests.  She couldn\'t do much the so I had a little trouble with school work.  Then the day for the operation came.  My mom was so scare that she started hitting my step dad.  He didn\'t care.  They left at 7:00am for surgery.  I went to school.  I was scared she was dead because I didn\'t hear anything until 10:00am.  When my grandpa told me it wasn\'t cancer I was so happy.

'One day Len was very upset.  Her best friend told the teacher something that Len said.  Ashley, Len\'s best friend, told the teacher Len said if you were her mother, she would be terrified.  Len was so mad.  She felt like she was going to die.  She was so mad at Ashley.  From that day on Len hated Ashley.  Len didn\'t ever say that!  She thought her teacher was the best teacher in the whole world!  Ashley just wanted to be teacher\'s pet, and always try to suck-up to her.  Every time Len said something that made the teacher laugh, Ashley would just rephrase what Len said, and try to make it sound better.  Len always tried to tell the teacher that what Ashley said was not true, Len just got too scared and think the teacher wouldn\'t believe her.  Len thought the teacher forgot but really really deep down inside she knew that the teacher remembered.  Len was always trying to do cool and good things to the teacher, but that stupid-head Ashley always got in the way.  Len hated Ashley so much.  She wanted to strangle Ashley.  Len was always hoping Ashley wouldn\'t come to school, but every day she was there.  Len thought Ashley was a really selfish jerk.  At lunch, Ashley would always ask people for money.  Why couldn\'t she just bring her own money.  She always promised she would pay people back, but she didn\'t.  Ever!One day my best friend, Tracy, got really mad at herself.  Her grandma just lost her house.  She felt like she was going to get so mad she would explode.  She also felt very sad.  She was sad because she wouldn\'t get to see her mom that much anymore.  She wouldn\'t talk to anyone.  She looked sad, and mad all at the same time.  Every time she looked at the mom or dad, she would start screaming and get watery eyes.  She looked sick one day.  She felt sick, too.  She didn\'t come to school for so long.  She was frustrated, confused, angry, and sad.  She really was about to blow up.  She was so frustrated, she couldn\'t thing straight.  She was starting to get mad at everybody.  Even me!  She was so sick of her grandma getting loosing her house.  She was mad at herself because she always messed around with the grandma\'s stuff.As the days went by, Miss Hervey started to forget.  But Len was still mad at Ashley for what she said.  Len really wanted to say what Ashley said wasn\'t true, but she just didn\'t.  One day Ashley said to Len, man, I hate Miss Hervey.  That made Len really excited. She wanted to tell Miss Hervey what Ashley said.  But Len didn\'t.  She thought Miss Hervey wouldn\'t believe her.  So she just didn\'t tell.  One day Miss Hervey said to Ashley, someone said you hated me.  Ashley started lying again.  She said, no I didn\'t.  Len was thinking who told her.  That time Len wanted to rip out Ashley\'s guts.  Len hated Ashley so much!  Everyday Len started to pull Miss Hervey away from that jerk Ashley, but Ashley just said more and more lies to Miss Hervey.  So Len just tried her best to get Miss Hervey back from that day on.  Len was never going to give up until she got Miss Hervey back.',4,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.88,0,0,0,3.44,0,0,0,3.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,0,58.44,0,1.72,0,0,6.87,0,0,0,60.16,0,0,3.44,0,0,0,3.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.94,1.72,0,3.44,0,0,10.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.44,0,0,0,Female51
'\tFirst, my mom woke me up and then I got up and made my bed.  Then, I got dressed and came out to brush my teeth, wash my face, to fix my hair.  After that I ate cereal, put all of my books in my backpack and I packed all of my soccer stuff for one of my playoff games.  Then, I went to school, my mom drove me. I went straight to class and talked a little bit to my friend Jud before the lesson started.  We started to check our vocabulary homework and did some other homework sheets.  Then Mrs Gonzales came into start our class of Spanish.  We read some paragraphs while she recorded us.  Then, when that class was over we went to our electives.  I went to art, where I also talked to my friend Jud.  We were making 3D paintings.  After that, I went to advisory.  We didn\'t do a lot of things in there.

Then, I made my bed, and went to my bathroom to wash my face, brush my teeth and fix my hair.  After that, I went and ate blueberry muffins with milk.  Then, I fit all of my books in my backpack and my mom took me to school.  I was kind of late so I went straight up to my classroom.  I talked with my friends a little bit before my teacher started the lesson. First, we graded our worksheets that we had for homework.  That wasn\'t too fun.  Then she assigned us some work to do and when we finished we went to chapel.  When we came back from chapel we did our homework so we didn\'t have to do any at home.  Then, I went to computer class we typed a lot.  Next, I went to advisor.  After that, every one in middle school went to lunch.  I ate a sandwich, pudding, frittos, and I drank Pepsi.  Then the drudgery came I had to go to PE where all we did was run.  I ran 1 half a mile in four minutes.  Then we had to do an obstacle course (race).

'\tI haven\'t talked much about this because I have only had a couple of days since it happened.  What happened is a lady came in and for three days had us write for a gruesome 15 minutes and we couldn\'t stop until it was over.  It was hard because we got the same project every day, the very same one.  I\'m glad it is over because it was boring and pointless.\tOnce when Jack was a little boy he had a dog named Fritz. Fritz liked to explore a lot and sometimes went far from home. There was a construction sight down the road and Fritz often went there.  One day he went there and a construction worker picked him up and put him in the truck and at the end of the day drove with Fritz.  Jack was very sad and didn\'t do much outside.  His parents called neighbors and pounds but no one knew anything.  They even posted signs.  They never found Fritz.  At last they gave up and got new dogs. Jack still looked for him but never found anything.  He promised himself if he ever saw the workers again he would torture them and burn down their sites till they left forever.\tOnce there was a kid named Jack.  He played on his school\'s soccer team.  One day the soccer team had an away game and Jack and his friend were put into the same car together.  On the way there he and his friend were in the very back of the station wagon.  This station wagon had a tiny seat in the back that faced so if you sat in it you would be looking at the car behind yours.  Well, there was a man driving behind them that was dressed like a hippie.  So Jack and his friend made a peace sign and it made the hippie man all mad.  He kept on staring the two friends like he was an insane ax murderer.  Well this scared Jack and his friend so they ducked down so the man couldn\'t see them. Every once and a while Jack would look up to check on the hippie man and every time the hippie man was there.

'One day I was riding my roller blades and I lied to my friends.  So I told them that I was good.  So we went roller blading and I saw some pictures and I cut them up and spread it all around and I never told my mom.  But I never forgot that.  And when I roller blading again I accidentally fell a lot of times my friends didn\'t want to play anymore.  And here\'s another story when I was playing with matches I accidentally put the back house on fire.  But my grandpa fixed it.

'It was the first game of the three game series.  Both teams won a game and it all came down to this, the state championship in you hands.  The game went smoothly for the first half of play. Then in the first fourteen seconds the opposing team scores a goal one to nothing.  you fight.  You play.  It pays off and you yourself score.  With adrenaline pumping you feel happy, nervous and tired.  When the horn blasts your heart leaps for joy and fall down in excitement, but only for a moment.  Your coach picks five players to kick  in the shoot-out.  First David, the Jay, after him Greg, Garet, then you.  Okay, being the captain of course you\'re last.  Everyone scores.  The pressure is immense, a soccer championship on you shoulders with scouts looking at you from other states in state competitions.  You breathe in and out, a thousand thoughts cross your mind.  Will I make it?   Will I miss?  You\'re anxious to get it over with.  You feel goose bumps on your arm as the referee blows the whistle.  Your first step is hesitant and you feel anxious.  Another step, more confidence.  You start to jog up to the ball and smack the ball sails to the upper corner, the goalie dives but it\'s too late.  All of a sudden you hear a tink!  Off the bar.  You lose!  Right then you fall down on the ground lying and ready to heave.  All the thoughts come back with a nasty feeling in your gut.  And leaves the same.  you look up at your coach and see the disappointment in his eyes.  That is when you start to feel the worst pain and agony of all.  Letting your whole team down.  Slowly you walk to your team\'s van with no one to comfort you.After the game my feelings went berserk.  I felt sad, guilty, sick and cold.  No comfort for me.  No matter who said what I still felt terrible for weeks.  Story two.  It was when I was young and I knew my grandma wasn\'t doing well.  We went up to New York where she lived and stayed with her for a week.  My dad, brother, sister, and I went home but Mother stayed.  Three days later I got a phone call from Mom saying she died.  I think I was too young to understand but just going back to New York to see her funeral I felt at peace.  Knowing she went to heaven and her pain is gone I felt better but still sad.  I was the last person to go up and see her in her coffin.  I looked at her.  I cried a little but didn\'t let anyone else see.  When I went home I felt sad and sorry for Grandpa and my mom.  I understood later what really happened and all when I was older.  She died of cancer.  It makes me sad and happy to know she is in a better place, but sad because she is gone.  I got her cross she always wore when she was alive and I still wear it wherever I go and my feelings of happiness and sadness go with me and most importantly her memory is with me always.  She was very special to me.  She was always the one who made me happy when I was little.  If she didn\'t or wasn\'t such a special person to me my feelings would be totally different.  Still to this day I feel sad she is gone.After the funeral of course my feelings weren\'t that bad in a sad way because I didn\'t know, I was too young.  But when I was older I had sadness mostly, the happiness faded away because I\'m starting to forget times and memories about her and that is very upsetting.  Story three.  I became upset at someone when they lied about something that was really important to me.  He didn\'t mean to, he said, but I know him too well.  I felt hurt, rejected, and like I couldn\'t be trusted.  I mean he didn\'t tell me the real truth and that means he probably couldn\'t trust me.  I felt I lost a friend and that hurts.  You feel nauseous, hot, about to explode!  But when you cool down it all goes away except the big question, Why?  Then you make up reasons you know aren\'t true and you make yourself feel worse.   After all this, I asked him and he said he really didn\'t know!  He just said something that he made up so I wouldn\'t get hurt.  I know that sounds silly but that is my friend.  We still are friends and my feelings about that faded away quickly like they usually do.  I\'ve never cried at something not big time sad.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,2.43,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.73,0,0,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.43,0,0,3.65,0,0,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,4.86,0,0,43.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,65.62,0,0,10.94,0,2.43,0,2.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.65,21.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.65,0,0,14.58,Male51
'I finished my last most upsetting thing last time I think. So I will start a new one. That was the most upsetting think that has happened to me. There are many other things that upset me a lot though. Like when my brother hits me and hits me like I am not paying attention to him. When the does not expect it I get him beat him down. Oh I will only hit him once and he will start crying plus I get in trouble for hitting him back when he started it. Then my mom tells me he is smaller than me and all this crap. Then I tell her if does not want to get hit he better stop. Another thing that makes me mad is when my dad talks me to go and do something that he was very capable of doing. Like getting him an asprin or changing the television while I am doing something of the most importance. I also hate when I have to clean up all the mess my little brother makes in the house. I really hate homework. I mean it takes my time and theirs. It takes mine by the amount of time I have to play games, play outside, watch television, or talk to my friends on the phone. It takes theirs by they have to take it home and grade it and they cannot do anything either.The thing that upset me the most is the time I was caught stealing baseball cards. This is something I do not talk or write about alot because it is so embarrassing. I was in the fourth grade I think and was really into baseball cards. Since me parents would not give me any money to buy then I stole them. They thought spending money on little pieces of cardboard was stupid. The first time I stole them I had just bought some stuff for my Dad. After I paid for the food the cashier left The cards were just sitting there call to me Take me. You know you want to. So I did. I stuffed them in the bag and left like nothing happened but when I got outside I ran like a bat out of Hades. When I got to the corner where I had to cross the street I got them out and opened them. I did not want my dad to see them  so I put them in my pocket and walked home carefully so they would not bend. Then everyday after school I would go in and get about two or three packages of cards and leave with the quickness. Every time I did it I would tell myself do not do it but I did it anyway. Usually my brother would not come with me but for some reason he came. I wore my jacket with the pocket in the inside so I could carry more cards. It was almost a done deed but as we were walking out a man was looking at us funny. I don\'t remember where I left off so I\'ll just start somewhere. I kept saying it was so very easy to get it and stuff it in my pocket then leave. everyday after school I could go in and out watch time with a package of cards or pack of pencils. One time for some reason my brother came with me. He didn\'t usually come with me so it was pretty strange. We went in like nothing was going to happen. We grabbed five or six packages of cards. He didn\'t have then on him though because I kept them.  When we were walking out a man stopped us and told us to go with him. We went upstairs where he patted us down. He found all the cards on me and none on my brother. I told him to let my brother go because he didn\'t do anything but they wouldn\'t let him go. They said they called the police but we didn\'t believe him. But sure enough the police arrived and asked us a lot of questions. They called my parents who by that time were very worried. They wrote me a ticket and put it on my records. They told me if I ever did it again they would send me to juvenile. We went home and my dad was real mad. I though he was going to hit me for doing that but he didn\'t/ Buy was I relieved. But he put the ticket on my door so whenever I think of doing it again Ill think twice. The ticket tore and I threw it away.  I  don\'t steal anymore unless it is very necessary.',3,-5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,11.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.75,0,0,11.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.25,1.25,0,1.25,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male51

'I am upset about us electing President Clinton again.  I did not like any of these candidates but we had to have one but why him!  I feel angry that we elected him.  Good thing this is his last consecutive term in office.  But to be in there for the next four years?  Why not Dole or Perot they would be better than Clinton.  The other candidates had better views.  People just look out how our country is doing since George Bush was in office.  This guy messed it up.  But to get another four years to do it all over again.  People get out of there.  He is bad.  I could do a better job at being President.  You voters just destroyed things for your kids.  Do you want that?  How?  Get Clinton out of the White House.  And another thing the White House, why not a different color?  Like blue, green, purple, you know that stuff.  You have to do something about our government.  It is the worst government I ever seen.  And another thing about our government.  Why are we giving money to other countries when we are in debt ourselves.I am still mad about electing BIll Clinton. He is not a bright man.  And on my last topic aoubt our government.  Why are we making new bombs to replace the old bombs.  They are still good and how are we getting rid of the old ones.  By dropping them on some uninhabitied country or is it our moon.  I wonder how those craters got there.  Don\'t you?  They say this is the smartest country right?  The other countries are smarter.  We are just giving them money.  They\'re getting richer than us.  So lets stop paying them and start decreasing the national debt.  This country is stupid.  Well us kids aren\'t.  But the government sure is.  They raise taxes to suit their own needs.  Why don\'t we tax them.  They caused the debt.  Us kids are going to use all our money to end the debt.  Why don\'t they give trillions of dollars to us kids.  That would make us kids happy.  Just ask any kid if he would like a trillion dollars.  I can take a bad government for a few years, but four years that is a little too much.  Do you agree?  I though so.  So why did you vote Democrat?  Those jerks.  They want to kill baby before they are even born.  What if that baby was you?  Would you like to be killed?  I thought so.  So vote Republican or other.  Just not Democrat.One time someone said me and someone else were.  It just kept getting around the school and people just kept talking.  A different thing was with my brother a long time ago we always used to fight.  I got on his nerves and he got on mine even after that happened.  I am glad we do not fight a lot anymore.

'The most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was that I broke my leg playing soccer.  The experience was so horrible that I was in so much pain even when I was in the hospital.  The other upsetting that happened to me was that my cat died.  Her legs went out on her and when I was on the class trip she just died.  The other upsetting was that my family was getting a a divorce.  I got so mad at my mom and my dad tat I didn\'t want to stay with my mom or my dad, but the court said I had to stay with one of them so I stayed with my mom.  My Dad is living in a apartment that is called Timberglen Apartments.  I see him most often, but I still love him he\'ll always be my dad.  I like living with my mom, but sometimes it gets kind of boring.  So I go spend the night with my dad in my room.  Me and my dad have a lot of fun.Like I was saying my parents did get a divorce, but I still love both of them even if they are divorced.  The other upsetting experience that happen to me was when I found out that my girlfriend was cheating on me.  I will not mention her but she sits right in front of me, but she told me that she broke up with him.  So I asked him and he said \"Yes, she did broke up with me.\"  So I know if she just like me as a friend or more than a friend.  I don\'t know, but people are saying she likes me more as a friends, but I ask her and she says \"I like you as a friend,\" but I know she like me more as a friend cause she constantly flirts with and she laughs at my stupid jokes.  Plus there is another girl who likes me, but I don\'t like her.  Her name is Christy.  She is in the seventh grade, but the girl who likes me more as a friends want to go see the movie Romeo and Juliet, but she is too shy to ask me.  So I might ask her to go the movie with me.  Plus the girl in the seventh grade wants to go see the same movie with me, but I might not want to so see the movie with her well got to go now see you tomorrow.Where I left off was when I was talking about the two girls who like me more as a friend.  I am still waiting to see if they want to go see Romeo and Juliet if they don\'t ask me by the end of next week I\'ll ask them myself and we\'ll see what happens.  The other upsetting thing that happen to me was that I was in a car wreck.  It was so terrible that I even didn\'t get hurt one bit.  Plus another thing happen to me,.  I had a girlfriend before those other two girls her name was Katie.  She was so fine that every time I said good-bye she said \"I love you\" but after a couple of days went by she never called back.  I day called her and her mom picked up the phone and I ask if Katie was there and she said \"No she is gone to go see a movie with a guy.\"  That was when I felt very upset.  The day after she called me up and that was when I told her that we are breaking up and then after she heard that word she stated cry and then all of a sudden she just hung up the phone, and that was the last time I ever heard of her.  That will have to be the upsetting that ever happen to me.  Well I got to go now maybe I talk to her next time.  So see you later.

My friend said he felt like dying or getting revenge on the floods who did it. When I was eleven years old my cousin that was twelve was fatally injured when she was hit by a car. One day after school my cousin was walking across Polk to get to the bus.

'\tI think another upsetting experience is when my great grandfather died.  I didn\'t know him that well, but I was still sad.  I was sad because when I was little we used to go to his farm on the weekends and ride the horse and shoot the gun.  The most upsetting thing was when he died he had to give the farm away, so my great grandmother had to move into an apartment.  I was sort of lonely because he talked to us when we were there.  It was weird because all the great times and memories I had there were all gone.  It was like they just disappeared or vanished into thin air.  It was also a happy time because he was getting to leave this place where he was crippled and dumb and had to sit in a chair all the time because he couldn\'t move.  He also had lung cancer.  The reason he was crippled was because he got kicked by a mule when he was younger.  I think another upsetting experience is when my great grandfather died.

The most upsetting thing was when he died he had to give the farm away.  \tI think the most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me is when my great grandma died.  I think it was the most upsetting thing because she was my most loved grandparent.  I was sad because I knew she wouldn\'t be here for me and couldn\'t come to any of our school events anymore, but she had come to every one before she passed away.  I felt lonely and depressed because I loved her so much and then she left.  I was also happy because I knew she was happy where she was and not suffering down here.  I was also glad because I knew she cared about me and told me she loved me before she died a couple days later.  The most special part was she gave me a puzzle for Christmas and then she gave me a hug.  I was also sad because I was losing the best grandparent in the world.  The reason I think she was the best grandparent in the world is because I knew she cared and loved me with all her heart.  She would also give her life for me and get me anything I needed.  That is my most upsetting thing that has happened to me. \tOne of my most upsetting experiences was when my great great grandmother died.  The reason I think it was the most upsetting experience is because when she died I was sad, depressed, and happy in a way.  The reason I was sad was because she had always been there for me and supported me in all the things I did.  She came to visit us on our birthdays, school activities, and sometimes because she just wanted to come and visit. The reason I was depressed was because she was nice, loving, kind and would get me anything I needed.  The reason I was happy was because she had lung cancer and pneumonia all at the same time.  She had had to have many surgeries that were failures.  I think she was also glad to be able to leave, in fact she said not to try to save her because it was hopeless and to just let her go.  I also felt loved even though she was dying she got me a Christmas present.  It was a puzzle that I still have even to this very day and I always will.  One of my most upsetting experiences was when my great grandmother died.

'\tLet me continue on what I was talking about yesterday. If I can remember I was to the part at which my friend called up to say sorry and to ask if he can come over and play nintendo.  I asked my mom and she said yes and he came over and we had fun.  Another time it was upsetting was when I was wrongly accused for taking some thing.  I was blamed and I was mad.  I felt like destroying something.  But later that week they found the missing object in my enemies room hidden in his drawer in the back so they called my house to say sorry to me and to invite us to their house for dinner to seal things up with me and my parents.\tAnother upsetting thing that happen to was when my teacher came over and mark off 10 points on my paper for talking and I didn\'t talk.  I tried to tell her that I was not talking but she said that she saw me turn around when I was going to pick up my pencil even some others saw me and they said to me they saw me and that I was not talking.  I was mad and a bit sad at the same time but when I got the paper back I flipped it over and saw a note on the back.  It said that someone came over and told her what happened the truth so I did not get the 10 points off but I don\'t know who did it who confessed for me I tried to find out who did it but I never did.  Another thing that happen to me was when some one cut in front of me in line.\tI think the most upsetting thing that happen to me was when I was rejected by my friends to play with them.  I felt sad and unwanted but I felt angry so I keep all my anger in a ball is held it inside.  Then when my friends called me back my anger went away and I was happy again and I went on with my day.  When my mom picked me up and asked me how was my day I thought back and said \"pretty good!\"  When I got home I sat down and played nintendo when the phone rang.  It was my friend asking if he could',3,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.93,0,0,2.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.89,0,0,0,7.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.63,0,0,7.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.3,4.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.48,0,0,4.96,Male51
'One day Thou Doe was walking around in his front yard, he was bored and it was to do much of anything. He thought about what he wanted to do. He asked his mom and suggested chores but of course he didn\'t want to do that, so he kept thinking and thinking and finally he thought of something. He saw his friend down the street riding his bike. He asked his mom if he could ride his bike with Jr Ramesez, Thou Doe\'s friend, and she said yes. John got his bike out and went down to Jr\'s house, but when he got there Jr was sitting out the front porch and said he was too not ride his bike anymore when John asked why on was on his porch. Jr saidWhen I got there he had put his bike up but he could still play so we was playing and started chasing each other. Me on my bike and him on foot. I finally caught him though, it was very painful to him because I say over him. He was lying face up on the side walk when I did. He was spread out so when I ht him he was like  human bicycle jump and I couldn\'t stop. He hates my guts now.There was one other slightly upsetting time. I was before the first one I wrote. This one was during third grade till now. One day a friend (Clint Calvin) asked me if I wanted to skip the rest of the day since it was only thirty minutes till then. I said yes, of course. After lunch we went outside instead of to class. We hid out for about fifteen minutes of the time then we wanted to move to a different spot. When we tried to we realized that these were teachers over there. So we were going to go back inside and as we turned around we saw our teachers. We were sent to the assistant principal\'s office.

'I remember the time I was at my cousins house and we left to some friends house, and while we were on our was over there my cousin dialed nine one one on a pay phone with out me knowing and while we were walking the cops stopped us and asked us if we were the ones who dialed nine one one and I told him no because I didn\'t know my cousin had dialed nine one one . And while we were walking he told me in was him who had dialed nine one one at a pay phone. I was really mad at my cousin I just wanted to do something bad to him for what he had done. So for the rest of the day didn\'t say nothing to him so we wouldn\'t get into an argument. I was really mad that day, but after a while I calmed down but I still didn\'t talk to my cousin. There was this time when I got into a fight with a neighbor. That day I just really mad almost trying to do anything to get into trouble. I was really mad because my neighbor was talking bad about my mom and I heard him and that made really upset and made me get real angry. So I over his house and told him to come out and I started beating him up for talking about my mom that\'s one thing nobody makes fun of or talks about because it makes me mad.The most upsetting thing that ever happened to me was when cops stopped me while I was walking home from the store. They told me too get against the car and then searched me for no good reason. I was asking then why they were searching me and they told me I looked suspicious. I was really angry I just wanted to tell them something back, because they treated me like I was  a criminal or had done something really bad. They took off and just stayed there real mad at them and since that say I do not really like cops at all. Another upsetting thing that happened to me was when I got hit by a van while riding my bike. The thing that upset me was because she did not get off the van and try to help me out or see if something bad happened to me. That afternoon she came by and I just started arguing with her and she called my mom and she started  screaming at her so I really angry andI think the last thing I was writing about was the time my cousin prank called the police and I was really angry and upset with him for what he had done. And there is a whole lot of other upsetting things that happen to me at home, like when something wrong happens to my brothers I am the one who gets in trouble or if they start crying they always blame me, and that gets me upset because they think I am the bad one of the house. So I do not really like being inside my house that much, I am always outside or at somebody else\'s house, so I won\'t get mad or upset at someone. This is all I could think or right now of all or some of the upsetting things that have happened to me.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.24,0,0,0,24.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,41.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.55,0,0,24.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.24,5.17,0,3.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male51

'One upsetting thing that has happened to me and really hurt is that my grandmother passed away when I was in the second grade and about seven years old. She was supposed to go recover from her illness but she never did. She had been in the hospital for about a month and a half. Then she passed away. the thing that really hurt me is that I was never told she was gone until the day my parents said we are going to go see your grandma. I was excited but when we got to the funeral home and I saw her I started to cry. I was also mad at my parents and other family members for not telling me she died. I cried all night and did not want to  come out of my room. I guess my parents did want to let me know because they knew it was going to hurt me but it hurt me more when they did not tell    me until Ii saw her myself at the funeral home. At her burial I did not want to leave.Another sad event that happened to me is that I wasThe second thing that happened that hurt me or upset me was when my grandpa was getting operated on at Lakeland hospital they said he was going to be all right after the operation he was very sick and we thought he was not going to make it but he did, but it is kind of hard because he is kind of old and deaf from one ear. Another incident that happened that was frightening that it was fourth of July and we were having a party at my cousin\'s house. When my sister ran in the street she wasn\'t looking and  a car was coming the car stopped as fast as it could my sister fell we thought she had been hit but she was okay the car did not hit her it was close.

'\tWell yesterday I talked about knocking my two front teeth out.  But I ran out of things to say so I will write about something else.  2  About five years ago my grandmother died at the age of 55.  She died because she had diabetes.  She was a wonderful grandma.  She was like my second mom.  Except my grandma rode roller coasters with me and took me to a lot of fun places.  When ever I went over to her house she always had something to with us.  And she always had a wonderful meal prepared for us. When I went to her funeral I was so so so sad for my grandpa and for my whole family.  I think that was the saddest day of my life.  Because I loved her so much.  And she was so nice to everybody.  I just don\'t understand why God had to take her away from us so early.  She was such a good person.  But I think she did the most with her life as she could.  And I really do believe that when she died her soul went to heaven.  \tSomething that made one kind of mad was when my dad told me that somebody stole my motorcycle.  And the bad thing is that they stole it in the day time while everybody was around.  They stole it from my dad\'s car lot. So the next day we went to look for another.  We found one but it was like 1000 dollars so my dad said no.  But we kept on looking and looking and looking.  Until one day about 2 years ago we found.  It was perfect. It had five years and a lot of power.  And the good thing was we bought it from a kid about 16.  He was saving up for a TV.  He sold us the motorcycle for 200 dollars.  That day I was very excited. I even went to a place and rode it.  Because I do not want to end my life short because I got ran over by a motorcycle. If you ask me that is kind of stupid. So I am going to stick with just riding it for fun.  One day my sister tried to ride it.  She did pretty good too. Until she burned herself on the exhaust pipe.  From there on she has not ridden it once in 2 years.  So the moral of this story is always watch over all of your stuff.  And do not let your dad watch over it. And last but not least do not let your sister ride it.The deepest and most worst thing that ever happened to me is when I knocked out my two front teeth.  It all started when I went to Canada to play hockey.  We went to a lot of neat places like water park, and amusement parks.  At the water park there were a lot of fun slides.  The fastest one was awesome.  But it wasn\'t too cool when I knocked my two front teeth out on that slide.  I knocked them out on the slide because I flipped over and hit my mouth on the slide.  I knocked them out half-way down the slide so I had to go down the rest of it before I could show anybody.  When I showed the lifeguard she told me to go to the first aid guy.  The first aid guy drove me to the emergency room.  But at the hospital they didn\'t have a dentist on duty.  So they to us to walk to the dentist.  Which was about 2 miles away from the hospital.  When we got to the he put some numbing stuff in my mouth and put one to back in.  He didn\'t put the other one in because we couldn\'t find it.  When I got home my mom almost fainted.  So she took me to the orthodontist and they put in a brand new tooth where I didn\'t have one.  So now I have my two front teeth back.  My teeth use to not be that straight and now they are.',4,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,7.28,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.82,Male51

'One day Billy Bodd Isbu was in the mall shopping with his mother.  They went from store to store until it seemed they had been shopping forever.  Billy was so bored he wanted to go home.  His legs were tired and he was starving.  Finally, after the ninety- seven department they became patron of Mom said, \"Okay, let\'s go home!\"  Billy was jumping for joy.  On the way to the floor the parking garage was on Billy and his mom rode quietly in the elevator.  Of course, Billy had to push all of the buttons!  Then, all of a sudden, Billy stepped out of the elevator and onto the wrong floor!  His mother hadn\'t realized it till it was too late.  BIlly found himself in a strange, new world.  Where was he?  Had he died and gone to heaven?  Had he been abducted and aboard an alien space craft?  No!  It was the eleventh floor.  Billy had a funny feeling inside, the kind you have when you get lost.Billy was feeling very afraid, his eyes watery with tears.  Then, out of nowhere, an elderly couple that looked as if they been alive since creation came up to him and asked \"Are you lost?  Where\'s your mommy?\"  All of a sudden his mother came rushing up the stairs to Billy\'s outstretched arms.  He was greeted with tears of joy and thankfulness.

One candle, in particular, he put in a holder that was shaped like a cup and had many holes in it.  When the candle in the holder almost went out he decided to put some incense in there so it could burn longer and smell good at the same time.  Two for one!  As he put it in the fire became strange looking, like something you would see when you light a torch.  The fire spread around the bottom of the cup as if it were a puddle of water.  \"Cool,\" said Ishbu as he stared in wonder.  He let it burn for about ten minutes when he finally said \"I better put this out.\"  For the flame was already six inches above the ccandle holder.

'While I don\'t remember where I was, but here goes. We were all at the party having fun tripping out. The people in the back were getting high off some killer just like any old party. It was around two in the morning and everybody was going outside. The Crips was on one side and the Bloods was on the other. Me being the person I am I went over there with the Crips and started chilling with them and talked to some of my homeboys. That\'s when my so called best friend called me a Crapcrip and one of the FL niggers was like who then he points at me. The boy asked what I was doing with that blue on his hood and stole me dead in the jaw so we started fighting. Then some other fool jumped in. Next thing I know was I was fighting four slobs and I was bleeding by my eye. Well another highly upsetting moment was when I dislocated my shoulder and had to leave the game without returning. The trainer told me I would have to go to the doctor and get x-rays. Well the doctor told me I would miss a game and the worst part about it was that the game I would miss would be the hype game of the season we were undefeated and they were undefeated both at five to zero we all knew that whoever won this game would win district and city, so it was set. Coach was mad because I played monster linebacker on the strong side also played running back and thanks to report cards many of our second string flunked off. So coach was very upset. The best thing was I did come back played and Coach told me that I played the best game of my life so far..The one day I will never forget is I was jump at a BFL party that was fucked up. It all started when I got back from camp where Ii had lots of fun. I got a call from a friend of mine that I got real close to. I mean we were at the point where we did everything together. And he invited me to a party at the Boys Club in BFL so I said yes I\'ll go because I had went to one before so I did not think anything of it we were just going to have fun and trip out. He also invited three other of our friends we were all home boys and shit and we claimed to have each other\'s back if one of us ever got into a fight no matter what went down. So we all went to the party it was hype, like we knew it would be so we got our little old freak on and what ever.

'\tI awoke at 6:53am and started on my homework, because I did not finish it the night before because I didn\'t get home from a playoff game until 6:45pm.  Well I got my stuff together and then my ride came when I got to school I went straight to my locker and got my books for my first class language arts halfway through class we went to chapel.  After that we came back and did homework until it was time for elective during that period I studied for a test next was advisory where we watched a film on Shadrock Marshall and abundance.  Then we went to lunch after that we went to PE.  Next we came in and have to write for fifteen minutes on a topic given to us which I am doing, I am writing an essay on what I have done today, a essay of which I just wrote for a student getting a master\'s degree.  I think there is nothing more for me to say because I can\'t foretell the future and I am starting to get writing cramp and my hand is starting to hurt.  This essay is probably some sort of assignment.At precisely 6:45am I awoke and dreaded another day at school.  I didn\'t get my homework done the night before because I was sick and I could not do it on Friday or Saturday because I was camping so I had to do my homework.  I got all of it done and finished at 7:35am.  My ride comes at 7:40am  so I had to hurry to put on uniform get a banana for breakfast my books and go when I got to school it was 8:07am, school starts at 8:05am.  I had to run to my locker.  And go to class.  First subject was vocabulary and it was blah.  Its boring point less and annoying.  Next was grammar that is even worse.  After that was history, its not too bad but I got 5 points taken off my paper for reading someone a comic on the election.  Next a mean old lady came in to teach Spanish.  She kept yelling at us and so on about the Spanish culture.  Spanish teacher has a nickname the tornado because she\'ll ruin your day.  After that I went to my first elective study hall, it is my favorite class because its with Mr Thornman and he lets us do all kinds of crazy things like taking his Iguana and freaking people out, boxing matches and sometimes we go out and play football.  My next class is advisory and its with Mr Thornman also.My first thing I plan to do is write this essay next we will do math. I hope I can get it done so I can have free time when I get home.  After math will probably be a work time until school lets out.  When I get home I will probably get a snack than go to a friends house to fool around.  We will probably have a water fight or catch bugs.  After my dad picks me up from my friends house he will take me home.  Then me and my family will eat dinner next I have to do my homework which will take about one hour.  After I am done with my homework I read for about 30 or 45 minutes before I turn out the night light.  First I plan to finish this now. First I plan to finish this now.

'The next day we went to the funeral.  It was sad and very upsetting. The same priest said the funeral as always.  On our way home we stopped at my dad\'s college The University of Kansas.  It was the biggest most beautiful college I have ever seen.  When we got back to Wichita, Kansas we changed clothes went to lunch and got ready to leave at the airport and fly home.  I will never forget it.  The end.My uncle got sicker and sicker.  I was glad that I was in the other car.  By the time we got to Breckenridge everyone was hungry.  My dad, grandma, uncle Gary, my cousins, my sister and me.  So we went to a restaurant called Coca Cola burgers and fries.  It wasn\'t good but it was good for a place out in the middle of Missouri,  The only thing good about Breckenridge was the hotel.  It was big and had a pool.  But of course it had to rain.  Later about nine it stopped.The most upsetting thing that happened to me was when my grandma died.  It was very upsetting and sad.  It was about one week before my birthday on March 25.  My great grandmother\'s husband died seven months before her.  I was at both of them.  My great grandma was buried in Breckenridge, Missouri.  On the way it couldn\'t have gotten worse first my uncle got sick.

'\tAnother thing that upsetting to me is when I get in trouble for nothing!  Yesterday Me and Tia were play with the jump ropes and one of her $350 hair things came off and Tia held it in her hand and we started jump roping.  Shon came over and started to fight with Tia and knocked the hair bow out of Tia\'s hand and she couldn\'t find the hair bow.  And Shon ran away and wouldn\'t help her find the hair bow.  So we looked all over for it and Tia got in trouble but Shon still had to by new hair bows.  And in Tylor Cristal got blamed because we were skating and she stopped and called a friend on the outside telephone.  The police came and these ladies thought she called 911 and she didn\'t and Cristal got in trouble.  And Edward got blamed on because Spencer thought he ate all my sweet tarts and all of the rest of my candy.  Ate hate being blamed and get in trouble for nothing.  One time Spencer got blamed on for stealing and he didn\'t steal.The most upsetting thing that has ever happened to me is losing something.  One time we were going to church and my mom lost a one hundred fifty dollar check that she needed to cash and we were at Bank One.  We went back home and checked the parking lot then went in the house and checked her room my room the table the computer and the living room the couch in her bedroom and the office we could never find that check so we went back to Bank One to see if the dropped it outside and it was not there.  So my mom got in the car with us and we went to church.  When we got there I sang in the church with the other children.  Mom was cleaning the car after church and she looked in her purse and there the one hundred fifty dollar check was.  Another upsetting thing that has ever happened to me is when I get teased by my friend.  One time we went to eat with Tia, Edward, Spencer, Dana, Mrs Shela, Miss Angie, and my mom.  Tia and Edward teased him at the restaurant and at the movies.  At the movies went to see Twister.  And every one was scared.\tBad thing.  I don\'t like losing things.  One time Tia lost 100 dollars and we couldn\'t find it, we looked everywhere.  We were at six flags, first we look on the Texas Giant.  Then we looked on the train and the water ride and the food place and we couldn\'t find it.  They shut the doors to six flags and nobody got out.  We went on all the rides.  Tia had to go to the rest room and I saw bugs bunny tweety bird and porky pig.  I went to go hug them then Tia came out of the rest room and looked for me and the dollar bill that said 100 then Tia got lost.  I found my mom and stayed with her.  Tia found the one hundred dollar bill and I was night so she bought a flashlight and looked for us.  We were on the Great War Scream when we got off we were looking for Tia and Spencer found fifty five dollars on the ground after we found Tia.  Spencer lost it in the field at my uncle\'s farm where all the cows and bulls were.  Spencer went to look for the money and he couldn\'t find it.  He was mad and he found it in the cow\'s mouth.',3,-5,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.25,0,0,0,4.87,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,1.62,0,0,1.62,0,17.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.48,0,0,4.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.75,1.62,0,3.25,0,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male51
