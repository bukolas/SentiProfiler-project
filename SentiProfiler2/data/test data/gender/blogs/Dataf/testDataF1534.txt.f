"weird"

let's discuss what this word means to us. to me it's one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace "interesting" but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him "weird" was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don't quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the oddest looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i'm called "weird", even though i'm sure it's often not meant that way :)
