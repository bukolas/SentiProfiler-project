It's our 20th episode and to help us celebrate, UGO's man about town, Parker Ward, dropped in to discuss the current holy TV trinity of Idol, Lost and the Olympics.  Are Simon and Ellen really mortal enemies or is their "feud" just another lame publicity stunt?  Does Survivor really suck?  Is Hoarders the best thing since Intervention?  And when will Claire quite yammering about her "bay-bay?"  All this and more answered to the best our ability on this week's cast!
