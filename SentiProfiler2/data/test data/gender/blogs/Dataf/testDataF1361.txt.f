Dreaming of traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina? The makers of Bueno, entonces... , the hot new Spanish language learning software , are trying to build their Facebook cred by reaching 10,000 Fans by March. If they get there, one lucky fan and a friend will win a trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina , for 10 days of intensive Spanish lessons, a chance to meet the cast and crew (and me, too!) and of course, have way too much fun. From now until March 12th, Bueno, entonces... is offering a series of contests on the Facebook Page, which offers free daily Spanish phrases, words and grammar lessons. 100 participants will be chosen as Finalists from the series of contests and will be entered to win the Grand Prize Trip. The complete contest details are posted on the Bueno, entonces...Fan Page . They've to a super-simple photo contest. To enter, just snap a picture of yourself holding a sign saying "I want to win a trip to Argentina" and post it to their Facebook wall. Then get your friends to 'like' and comment on it. But HURRY! The TEN finalists with the most 'likes' will be selected on Friday (February 5). So polish up your tango shoes and hurry and go check it out. About the program: Bueno, entonces... is like Rosetta Stone meets The Simpsons - the program is comprehensive, but at the same time hilarious and really engaging. Just released last year, it has been already featured in the iTunes App Store and on the Daily Candy website. To see more, check out their Learn Spanish website . I have taken my share of Spanish classes, believe me. Some were good, some were...not so good. But none were as funny or as motivating as the Bueno, entonces... program. Witty and wry, with more than a bit of adult humor, it's like watching a favorite TV show--you can't wait for the next episode! Though it's definitely geared to the twentysomething crowd, even old folks like Tom and me laughed out loud during many of the lessons. It's sexy--in a fun way. And since this is the Sexy Spanish Club blog, well, I feel that I must recommend this as it is THE sexiest Spanish-learning program out there. The two characters--the hot Argentine teacher (Jimena) and the kinda goofy student (David) definitely develop a certain...chemistry. It makes it fun. Will they--or won't they? I'm not telling. ;-) For those planning on visiting Argentina, you should know that this is the ONLY Argentine-oriented Spanish program available. It tells you how to pronounce things the Argentine way and includes plenty of cultural references and helpful (and entertaining) slang. Plus, it's portable: it can be instantly downloaded to your iPod, iPhone, Smartphone, or laptop. No need for that sweaty bus or Subte ride to a class, and no books to lug around--just plug in and learn...and laugh! What are you waiting for, gringo? Get started on your own sexy Spanish here . No, not really. Though it's true that my husband and I just bought a small farm in Uruguay , we are keeping our studio apartment in Buenos Aires and plan to visit regularly. After all, it's only two hours away and we have two daughters living in Buenos Aires and many friends--and though we plan to live a quiet life in the country (focusing on farming and writing) we will want a blast of city life every now and then! Why did we buy the farm? It was unexpected. We visited some friends--an expat couple, British and French, who had spent twenty years in New York--who had just purchased a farm. We saw how they were living, and it was just so appealing that we couldn't get the idea out of our heads. Two weeks later, we'd bought our own place (or at least, started the process). The real estate transaction went very well--quick, smooth, very nice owners who worked with us directly without using an agent. What appeals to us about it is the challenge of living even more simply , of connecting to the land, developing (re-developing...I grew up on a farm) our skills in terms of planting, growing and harvesting our own food, and living in a 90-year-old farmhouse without succumbing to our American instincts to redo and rebuild. It's beautifully simple as is, but not perfect--and we are looking forward to being okay with that. Most of all, we love the idea of investing in land, of being in a beautiful place and getting to know our neighbors in a setting that encourages cooperation, bartering, and sharing. And okay, I can't help but think that it will be a really fun place for our eventual grandkids to visit. ;-) But Buenos Aires is in my heart and always will be. I love it, and I really appreciate the creativity of the people (locals and expats). It inspires me, makes me think, makes me laugh, and helps me appreciate life. I know I'll feel the same way about life on the farm in Uruguay--but in different ways. Thought I'd update this blog--I'm posting regularly on my New Globals blog these days. I've even posted some fun little videos about finding my book in Barnes &amp; Noble and meeting my agent for the first time (I wrote the book in Argentina and did everything via email!) and most recently, seeing my book in a bookstore window here in New York . My book , The New Global Student: Skip the SAT, Save Thousands on Tuition, and Get a Truly International Education , was published by Random House on the 19th, and Tom and I are in New York for a month. Generally, authors do a book tour sort of thing, but we're doing things differently ! We've had a great time hanging out with three of our daughters here, celebrated when our oldest earned her master's degree (at 23) and started a new job this week, and just enjoying life in the East Village. We were excited to see the print edition of Smithsonian Magazine on the racks this week! As I'm sure many of you know, their cover story for the June edition is about living in Buenos Aires, and several expats are quoted, including me. Thanks for that, Daniel Politi! ;-) The interview was done well over a year ago, but the timing worked out very well as it was published the same week as my book launched ! There was a glitch in the shipment of books to the many education bloggers, organizations and others who were supposed to receive an early copy in order to build some buzz. We found out just last week that the books are still sitting in the warehouse ! Argh. This seriously hampers marketing efforts, as you can imagine, so we're doing a little damage control and scrambling. In fact, things are likely to pick up in a big way soon: later this week, a short feature on the book will be published in USA Today and a review is scheduled to appear in the Boston Globe either the 7th or the 14th (Sunday editions). I've had some radio interviews and podcasts so far and Tom and I are learning a lot in our lunch sessions with parents (a group of parents buys us lunch, we listen to their concerns about their kids' education and share tips). In fact, we had a fabulous one in Westport, Connecticut last Friday with a dozen people in attendance. Tom was the only guy, but hey, he's used to that. Most of all, we're just enjoying the moment and feeling grateful for the opportunity to have a book published and get a chance to share this message with those who can benefit from it. If you or someone you know is strugging with college costs, disheartened by the college-prep hassle, looking for inexpensive ways to study abroad, or just ready to hear some GOOD news about U.S. education , I hope you'll consider reading or recommending my book! Learn more at http://www.NewGlobalStudent.com It's also full of inspiring stories and helpful advice for anyone-- especially families --considering spending time abroad. And to all you aspiring writers in Buenos Aires and elsewhere---keep at it! Two years ago, I had no idea what I would write about and though I hoped I'd write a book someday, I was like millions of other people with the same vague dream. Keep dreaming, but more importantly, keep writing! You just never know where it can take you. Yep. It's true. Oh, it's not that we don't love it. It's been fantastic. We chose this location (just on the edge of Belgrano) three years ago when we had two daughters living with us, and it couldn't have been more perfect in terms of proximity to their schools--Islands International School and Universidad de Belgrano, and an easy bus or train ride to Lincoln University College. Just a couple of blocks from the Subte D line (Congreso de Tucuman stop, so you almost always get a seat!) and four blocks from the Nu√±ez train station, with bus 29 running right in front of our apartment as well. We have great neighbors and our sweet little street is quiet with very friendly people. Our building? Love it. Only three years old, with a lovely pool and parilla area on the roof, a small gym, and a large sauna. There are only two apartments on each floor, and ours is facing the back instead of the street. Despite the fact that we're only a couple of blocks from Cabildo, what wakes us up in the morning is birds in the trees below (we're on the seventh floor). So, why are we selling it? Well, regular readers will know that I just wrote a book and in May, Tom and I will be going to the US for the book launch and promotional tour...and we have no idea how long we will be staying. It could be two months, but it might be six or eight months, depending on speaking engagements and other opportunities. Also, we purchased a studio apartment in Palermo, right on Paraguay (between Armenia and Malabia) that has been under construction and will be completed in the next month or so. PLUS, our four daughters seem reasonably launched and as empty nesters, we just don't need three bedrooms. We really like to change things up, and we've always wanted to try living in a studio apartment, so Tom and I are excited to move into the little one. That means we've decided to sell this one, despite our daughters' concerns (we've assured them that we're likely to buy another place--with at least a spare bedroom--once we get back here after the tour stuff is over). Luckily, the wonderful realtor who sold us this place--Javier--is a friend and is helping us sell this one as well. He works with Cristian Bau realtors here in Buenos Aires and he's such a good man, a pleasure to work with and we trust him completely. By the way, buying property here isn't hard as long as you've got the cash since there aren't really any mortgages--we saw this place, bought it and MOVED INTO IT--all within a month. So, anyway--if you or someone you know might be interested in buying a really nice three-bedroom, two bath apartment in a great location--and we're happy to sell most of the furnishings as well for a VERY reasonable price--let us know. It's been a fantastic place for our family and I know that whoever ends up lucky enough to live here next will enjoy it as much as we have. To see the listing with photos, go to: (SOLD--NEVER MIND!) Maya is hard at work on her other blogs so I (her husband Tom) wanted to use her traffic to recommend a guided kayak tour of the Delta that I took last week. I have been up to Tigre and the Delta several times, it is only about 30 minutes from our apartment in Belgrano via train. Though the town of Tigre itself is worth a trip, I generally skip it to get out to the islands in the Delta. Generally we have taken the Interisla Collectivos (passenger boats that act as buses between the islands) and have gotten off at a restaurant pier or someplace else to go hiking. We have also rented a house for a weekend. But, what I really wanted to do was explore the myriad of small canals and channels that the larger boats cannot get into. Based on fellow expat Jonathan Harada's advice ( http://tutoramigos.blogspot.com ) we contacted Martin at www.eldoradokayak.com . Martin met us at the station and had already purchased tickets for the collectivo (boat) out to their island camp. I have been on the same route before though it was totally different as Martin is very knowledgeable about the Delta and during the entire 1.5 hour boat ride he gave us great information about the route. The last stop of the collectivo is their camp/house. Serenely quiet, the small canal had very few houses. All that we could hear was the winds in the leaves and the chirping of the birds. Martin's partner Chapa had a light lunch ready for us, set nicely around a picnic table in the jungle clearing. Their house is simple but new, clean with full changing and shower facilities. After a brief instruction on paddling techniques we set off in double and singles--very stable kayaks that were almost brand new. Time is different in the Delta and the two-three hours we spent blissfully paddling the small canals and channels flew by. My two daughters were hesitant to go initially (worried they were not strong enough) and completely enjoyed the experience. Our route took us through darker narrow passages as well as past grand houses on one of the larger rivers and then into seemingly untouched portions of jungle. When we got back, a lovely lunch of sausage sandwiches, tomato salad and vino patero awaited. Chapa and Martin are wonderful conversationalists and our hour lunch turned into a three hour (again time in the Delta is different) discussion of Argentine politics, culture and life on the Delta. When you visit Buenos Aires take this tour, you will not be disappointed. I have traveled a fair bit and the Delta is like nowhere I have been before and Eldorado Kayaks let me see it up close and personal. Some people like to do the look-back-over-the-last-year thing on December 31st. I prefer to do the what-a-cool-year-it's-going-to-be thing on New Year's Day. For the Frost family, lots of good things are in store and already in motion. Observe: --My book, The New Global Student , will be in bookstores on May 19th. So the next six months will be devoted to pre-launch publicity as well as sketching out Book Two. Lots of exciting times ahead as we start to get media attention for the book! --Tom and I are working together. We worked together as English teachers in rural Japan when we met back in 1983, and over the years, we've had businesses together and worked side by side. But we've always had our own projects. This year, I am very excited that he will be working directly with me on the business/nonprofit projects related to my book! We've always been far better together than apart, so there's no stopping us now! ;-) --Our oldest daughter (she is 22) will complete her master's in May. She's been working full time in addition to earning her master's so May will bring some relief but also new opportunities. Cool! --Daughter Number Two (just turned 21) graduated from college in December and finished two internships in Manhattan--one at a Latino ad agency, one at MTV international. Now, she is very happily working in an Irish pub (she LOVES it!) while saving money and also working as a freelancer for the ad agency. It's great to learn how to do freelance work (and negotiate for good pay) at the age of 21. This weekend, she is moving into a new apartment (she's been living with her older sister since August) and is thrilled to be living in New York and doing her thing. --Daughter Number Three also graduated from college in December (she is 19) and was offered a job as a multilingual events coordinator for a major cruise line. Unfortunately, the earliest they can place her in a position is March, so she is arriving in Buenos Aires today to spend the next couple of months relaxing, traveling and possibly pursuing other work options if the cruise thing is taking too long. --Daughter Number Four (she is 18) is here in Buenos Aires now on her winter break from college in upstate New York. It's a chance to visit us, visit her boyfriend (okay, we know he gets top billing) and see what it's like to come back to Argentina after being away for a few months. She's going to meet her boyfriend's family out in the campo (country) for a few days, which should be interesting. She'll return to New York in a couple of weeks, continue her studies, and do an internship this summer. It looks like she'll graduate with a BS in Applied Psychology (organizational psych, really) in December. It's a year of growth, opportunities and changes--exactly what we love best. ;-) Happy New Year, everyone! Tom and I had a great time at Normal 0 M
r de Aj√≥--just the two of us, the beach, the sun. Though I expected more wistful moments--this being our first Christmas in 22 years without kids--there were actually just a few, and we thoroughly enjoyed celebrating Christmas in a sleepy beach town. It's not sleepy now, though--the holiday crowds were arriving as we left! There was much painting and sprucing up being done during the time we were there. It was great to be the only foreigners around--everywhere we went, people asked where we were from, were very friendly and interested and we had delightful conversations with the locals we met. Not so nice--I caught Tom's cold (I guess I had time to get sick, so I did!) and thanks to some pretty horrible coughing yesterday, I seem to have a cracked (or at the very least, very sore) rib. So, just as I was during my recovery from gum surgery a few months back, I am VERY QUIET. It hurts to breathe, let alone talk, laugh or (OUCH!) cough. But the good news is that I got my first blurb for my book--from Dan Pink , author of A WHOLE NEW MIND. I loved Dan's book so I am utterly thrilled and humbled and awed that he wrote such a nice blurb for my book cover. Here it is: "With considerable verve and tremendous insight, Maya Frost offers a primer on how to take your education -- and your life -- into your own hands. THE NEW GLOBAL STUDENT is essential reading for any family yearning to step off the treadmill and plunge into the world." -- Daniel H. Pink, author of A WHOLE NEW MIND Nice, huh? I am looking forward to getting more blurbs soon--they are being sent to my editor at Random House/Crown and she is out of the office until January 6th. Dan just sent his along to me as a courtesy since he knew I was on pins and needles. It's especially meaningful coming from Dan as he is a father of three and took his kids on a sabbatical to Japan while doing research for his manga career guide, The Adventures of Johnny Bunko . So...quiet....and thrilled. Not a bad way to spend the next couple of days. ;-)
