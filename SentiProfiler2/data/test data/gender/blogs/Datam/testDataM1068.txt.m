Shiloh is the story of a girl that endures the Holocaust and struggles to rebuild her life once liberated. The Holocaust is one of those horrific moments in history, one that is simply too overwhelming to understand and filled with such evil and hate. It is difficult to comprehend the depravity that would allow such a thing to happen to one person let alone six million. What I find particularly puzzling is the aftermath. Whole families devastated and yet these people had the courage to pick up what was left of their lives and rebuild. Shiloh is the recognition of this rebuilding. The girl in the story suffers bitter abuse at the hands of her captors. Through the humiliation and wrenching pain the girl manages to endure and, upon liberation, begins to build her life from what was. The story of Shiloh is one that has been difficult to write thus a full novel is simply out of the question! After much deliberation I decicded blogging the story of Shiloh into episodes would be beneficial, would give this story its voice. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for visiting! --Tim
