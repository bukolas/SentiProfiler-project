Its not that I try to be anti-social, or that wouldn't like to get on with the people around me better. Its just that I get overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety. My mind keeps telling me that I'm not good enough, and that nobody wants to hear my voice. I just feel timid and afraid whenever I'm confronted by a social situation, so most of the time I avoid them.
