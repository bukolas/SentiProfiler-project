Is it all really for everyone else?
Sometimes at University, we discuss about modern society. It's a Journalism course, so we tend to have classes about Sociology, Midia and Antropology as well.

And often, there is a moment where I am let to think that everything we do, all the stuff we buy and the way we want our bodies to look is not for us, it is not something only for our good. It is for everyone else.


Our personality, what we own and how we look only really means something when the other person notices those things. We live in a society; it's where we interact, share moments, live. And how we are seen by everyone else matters. It really does.

We want to feel part of the whole group. The last thing we want is to feel left out. So we behave, buy and aim the same goals in life. We all want a job that will make us all earn good money, we all want to look good.

We all want to be accepted.

Is that a good thing? Those who go the opposite way tend to be belong to the groups most people wouldn't want to be part of: the poor, the fat, the insane.

Is it really like that? I would like to think we are better than that. We want to belong and feel welcome, that is true. But do we really need to consume and feel like the way we look always need improvement?

Sometimes, wouldn't you just like to not care?
