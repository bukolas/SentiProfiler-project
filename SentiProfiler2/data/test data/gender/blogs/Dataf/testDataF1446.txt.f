After upgrading from my old manual toothbrush to a Sonicare Electric Toothbrush I would never even consider going back to using my old and outdated toothbrush again. I actually enjoy brushing my teeth now and it does not feel like a chore to do. My teeth feel a completely new level of clean since the switch and I know it is working better when I go to floss and there is barely any food left behind after brushing between my teeth unlike before, although yes flossing is still necessary.
