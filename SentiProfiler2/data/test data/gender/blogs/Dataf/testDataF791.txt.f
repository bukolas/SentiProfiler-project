Today I took advantage of some free time and went shopping at Target and Walgreens. I was very happy with everything I purchased. One tip that I can give everyone is to know your prices. I keep a price book but over time I have gotten to know many prices so I know when I find a good deal. Like today, I found some toothpaste marked down for $3.49. I had coupon for $1.00 off that specific toothpaste.
