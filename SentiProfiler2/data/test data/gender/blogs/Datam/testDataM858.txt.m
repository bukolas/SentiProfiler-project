This winter, as we all gathered at my parent's to decide what excursions (onshore activities) we'd be signing up for, we all decided that today would be the day that we do something as a group with my parents. After all, they were paying for everything, and neither of them were planning on the snorkeling/caving/speedboating activities. So we decided to take in a Mexican folklore show, and then just kick back and check out the shopping and eating and everything else we might find.
