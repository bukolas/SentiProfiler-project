A few days ago I showed Ronald and Cale...two eight year olds that are rapidly becoming a pain in the ass...how to make tin can telephones. They come around often now wanting to know about more 'new' and 'neat' things.

    Today they discovered my bomb shelter...yeah, I got a bomb shelter here; a real built in maybe the early fifties bomb shelter. Underground over there  to the north thirty-six steps away from the house; just a big concrete box in the ground with a steel door, concrete steps leading down, air pipes and such sticking out of the top.

     Ronald and Cale were tagging along behind me this afternoon and fate led me over that way.

     "WHAT"S THAT?" hollered Cale, staring down the shelter steps.

     If I had been hooked up to a lie detector, I'd have said the same thing: "That's where my vampire lives," I said.

    There is no electronic instrument on the market today that could have measured the speed with which two young set of eyebrows shot up at that news, and I swear the temperture dropped a few degrees from the cold chills running up and down a couple of small backs.

    My offer of letting them go down there and peep in at my vampire was flatly refused. Ronald and Cale are of the modern world; they know not to screw around with vampires.

    But if the cops show up here any time soon inquiring about vampires, I'm gonna know right off the bat who ratted me out.
