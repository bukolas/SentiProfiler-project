Yes i realize that i have already written a blog today but after becoming a blogger so many different topics have played on my mind and i really need to get this one out of my head before it is all that i think about.

Music can change a persons mood, it can fill in as background noise or it can be the reason many people are gathering in the one location but my question tonight is; Is music really so influential on peoples lives?

I ask this because i just finished watching a DVD or pinks latest tour. now its no secret that i am a die hard pink fan, but her music has helped me through some very hard times in my life. For as long as i can remember i have listened to her music and learnt all of her songs word for word trying to learn hat they are about and their meanings. Now I'm not saying every one else is a die hard fan of hers but every person has at least one band that they love unconditionally, my partners for example is Korn.

The thought that has continued to run through my mind all day is "does music influence others the way it does me?" I'd really like to know, because i know in my life every time i look back on a hard part, a good part, the times that always make me cry and the times that always make me laugh, the on common denominator is music, different types for different moods or occasions but still music.

let me know if music influences your life or if u turn to music when you are having a hard time, id really like to hear your opinions.
