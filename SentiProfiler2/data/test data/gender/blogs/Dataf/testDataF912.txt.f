I am a dreamer and a bookworm; creative and somewhat adventurous. My sense of direction lets me down every time. I am sickeningly organised and have an ongoing love affair with lists. One part diplomatic, one part blunt. I can be stubborn and opinionated, but I'm lovely really. Give me handbags and shoes anyday. Especially shoes... Beautiful, shiny shoes with neverending heels that I can't wear for longer than ten minutes. Oh and lovely dangly earrings too. I do not smoke. I drink socially. I love chicken and pasta and a good steak, but cannot eat garlic and onions. If this were not the case, I'd very seriously consider being vegetarian. I love sunshine and I even secretly love rain. Mostly I love the smell of wet grass after the rain. And thunderstorms. I was born and raised in Malta; I moved to England in '06; Married my best friend in '08. We intend to live happily ever after.
