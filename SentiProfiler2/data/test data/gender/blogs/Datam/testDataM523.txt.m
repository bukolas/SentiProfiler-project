While this was all going on in the background, I pushed it away and did my best to enjoy all the good things that were going on around me, blessed with the support of my wonderful wife Dianne who continues to give me her strength. So it's a new year now and I am back to work and trying to figure out how to deal with an advancing cancer that will limit the time I have left.  I wish all of you the very best in the new year and ask that you throw some good wishes my way.
