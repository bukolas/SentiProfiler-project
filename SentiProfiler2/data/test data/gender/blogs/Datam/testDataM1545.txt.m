Lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its ThinkPad and IdeaPad lines. But a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. In addition to getting new Intel parts, the Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3 ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the Editors' Choice Toshiba mini NB305-N410 ($400.00 Direct, ) and the HP Mini 5102 ($400 Direct, ). Unfortunately, while the Toshiba NB305 and HP 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the S10-3's one-piece touchpad does the opposite.
