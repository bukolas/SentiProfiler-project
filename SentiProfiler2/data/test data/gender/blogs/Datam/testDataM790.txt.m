Let's see.... Today we talked a bit about reconciling a Buddhist practice or way of life with Western culture; not easy stuff. I'm really not the best to describe this, either, as I live in kind of my own world of philosophy, which is itself somewhat cut off from contemporary culture. If you have you're own reflections on trying to incorporate Buddhist ideals in life, please hit the 'comment' button and let us know.
