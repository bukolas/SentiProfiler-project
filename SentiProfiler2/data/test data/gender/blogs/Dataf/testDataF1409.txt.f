I want to run. To live. To live, every day. To see the world as full of beauty as it is. I don't want to surround myself with people who wonder why they exist. Who can't see the beauty; who don't see the purpose of it. I want to feel like dancing at my memories, dancing for my future, dancing in the moment. I want to giggle when I have no explanation for why.
