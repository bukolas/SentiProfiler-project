It was perfect weather in Malta. Average of 22 degrees celsius, light breeze, clear skies. Perfect for the half-marathon that we went down for. David's parents and I stopped to take photos and wave him on in support at various stops along the way, which was loads of fun. 

Luckily, we seem to have brought some of that glorious weather back with us!

In other news, I got a job! I'm a little bit nervous about starting so send me some positive vibes, won't you? :)
