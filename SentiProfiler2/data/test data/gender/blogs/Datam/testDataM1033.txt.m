So how do you prepare for a meeting 30 yrs in the making????

I have thought about what I would say to my father if I ever saw him again at least 100 times. Every time it was something different. When I was 13yrs old I would have said "Who the fuck are you?" At 23yrs old I would have said "You have a lot of nerve to show your face".. Today at 33yrs old I said nothing. I simply reached out my hand, pulled him towards me and gave him a hug. It seems that over the years I have had time to grow up and understand that holding in bad blood and half the story would only hurt me. I didnt ask what happen between my mom and him. At this point it does not matter. A few months ago my brother disowned me and I am not sure why but what I learned from that was that to have been given a second chance at a relationship with him would have been priceless. It has yet to happen but tonight I was faced with an opportunity to give someone a second chance. I lost a brother but gained a dad and now 2 sisters. We exchanged info and hours of stories. I even got him to leave my mom a voice mail saying hello and wishing her well. I guess he is giving second chances too. 

Everybody, this is my dad Mr. Iglesias aka "The Mariachi" and yes he still sings.
