Maddy is an ideal friend. He is a kind of a person which makes him comfortable with any person. Probably i like him a lot because he reminds me of myself when i was in school. He is very sincere,work-oriented,dedicated..... I still wonder if he will change like the way i did?? He can be tentative at times But thats jus quasi state.... We have had like a thousand and more discussions on philosophy,life etc. It is always fun to talk to him. He is very good listener submissive but not too passive to the extent of being boring. 
he is very positive, driven and looks to improve constantly. But wen you find him in a group on a happy occasion you can see a different person in him. He is all out going and talkative. He should hav been my project mate!! After all the talk that started atleast eight months before :( However i always gets to be his friend. :)

Show me your friend i will tell about you na... i will probably pick him !!
