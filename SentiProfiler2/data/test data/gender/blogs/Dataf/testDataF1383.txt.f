n June my husband and I took a trip through the Grand Tetons National Park and to Yellowstone National Park. My husband had always wanted to go there, and while I was fine with our destination, I wasn't necessarily all that excited about it. What a blessing it was to go there! I was absolutely amazed and awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of these parks. We stayed in West Yellowstone Montana at the Holiday Inn Sunspree Resort while we toured Yellowstone. It was wonderful.
