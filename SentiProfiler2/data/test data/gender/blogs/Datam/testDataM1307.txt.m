This is what I mean by small changes (to the input) begetting good example. A slightly transformed zero is still a zero. Of course, you have to be careful. If you rotate a six by 180 degrees, you get a nine. If you rotate a cat by 180 degrees, you get an unhappy cat. More seriously, if you're brave, you might start looking at a class of transformations called diffeomorphisms, which are fairly popular around here. These are nice because of their nice mathematical properties, but un-nice because they can be slightly too flexible for certain problems. Now, let's go over to NLP land. Do we ever futz with our inputs? Sure! In language modeling, we'll sometimes permute words or replace one word with another to get a negative example. Noah Smith futzed with his inputs in contrastive estimation to produce negative examples by swapping adjacent words, or deleting words. In fact, try as I might, I cannot think of a single case in NLP where we make small changes to an input to get another good input: we always do it to get a bad input! In a sense, this means that one thing that vision people have that we don't have is a notion of semantics preserving transformations. Sure, linguists (especially those from that C-guy) study transformations. And there's a vague sense that work in paraphrasing leads to transformations that maintain semantic equivalence. But the thing is that we really don't know any transformations that preserve semantics. Moreover, some transformations that seem benign (eg., passivization) actually are not: one of my favorite papers at NAACL this year by Greene and Resnik showed that syntactic structure affects sentiment (well, them, drawing on a lot of psycholinguistics work)! I don't have a significant point to this story other than it's kind of weird. I mentioned this to some people at ICML and got a reaction that replacing words with synonyms should be fine. I remember doing this in high school, when word processors first started coming with thesauri packed in. The result seemed to be that if I actually knew the word I was plugging in, life was fine... but if not, it was usually a bad replacement. So this seems like something of a mixed bag: depending on how liberal you are with defining "synonym" you might be okay do this, but you might also not be.
