I'm not usually a big fan of 'making of' videos - if I wanted to have the daylight poured in on magic, I'd buy myself a periscope and a ladder, and most album-making is like most other album-making - but Solex have come up with something a bit beyond the norm to promote their Solex VS Cristina Martinez & Jon Spencer Amsterdam Throwdown King Street Showdown thing . This, to be precise, is what they've come up with: Solex VS Cristina Martinez & Jon Spencer Comic Video from Bronzerat Records on Vimeo . There's been such a gush of affection for Galaxie 500 been inspired by the re-release of their catalogue you do wonder how it is they managed to not be solidly at number one for months at the end of the 1980s. Still, it's a good time for Damon and Naomi to be announcing a mini UK tour: April Friday 30 - Brighton - The Old Market £8. Doors: 7pm May Saturday 01 - London - The Luminaire £8.

Doors 8pm Bat For Lashes might have missed out on the Brits, but Natasha has picked up a prize at the UK Asian Music Awards . Which took place on Friday. First with the news as ever. Still, with the Asian Network doing so much great work for the Anglo Asian music scene, these awards are timely, giving a chance for the tireless team in Birmingham to be given a pat on the back; a chance to demonstrate some love for the AN. So who from the slate of Asian Network presenters won the best radio show category? Nihal - Radio 1 Oh. The winners in full: Best Album Jay Sean - All Or Nothing Best Female Act Amar Best Male Act Jay Sean Best Alternative Act Natasha Khan (Bat For Lashes) Best Club DJ DJ H Best Newcomer JK Best Producer Sukshinder Shinda Best International Act Rahat Fateh Ali Khan Best Desi Act Imran Khan Best Urban Act Jay Sean Best Radio Show Nihal - Radio 1 Best Video Jay Sean - Down Best International Album Miss Pooja - Romantic Jatt Outstanding Achievement Biddu Commitment to Scene Talvin Singh The supply of ass-kicking Japanese female-punked pop shows little sign of abating. Meet, as proof, The Suzan. To mark their appearance at SXSW, The Fader are hosting a free download of Home . If you'd like to try before you... well, not buy, as The Fader are doing it for free, but this is roughly the sort of thing to expect: Due 10th May: a new single from Nina Nistasia, Cry, Cry, Baby. Steve Albini is still producing for her. Better than that: there's a promise of a UK tour - brief, but with a fuller programme to come this Autumn. New-ish Placebo drummer Steve Forrest nearly set himself up for a sit com moment thanks to a scant knowledge of late 90s British androgopop : Yes, he tells my paper from Sydney, Australia, where Placebo were touring recently, he even thought lead androgynous singer Brian Molko, 37, was a girl. He recalls: "My tour manager played a Placebo CD and I said, 'This chick's cool. She has a really good voice'." It was only later, when Forrest met Molko in person, that he realised Molko is a guy. ... and only then after two or three weeks, when he realised he peed standing up. It says here. You'd have to think that Molko would probably be flattered and delighted if someone thought he was an actual girl. Providing it wasn't an ugly girl. Well, given that people are less keen on buying albums these days, you do need to have a second string to your bow. Will Oldham has just launched a limited-edition bottle stopper : Each bottle stopper was individually hand carved by the artist Scott Millar, so each one will be completely unique. Anyone ordering the bottle stopper from the mart will be sent an email to download all the album tracks on the release date, 29th March 2010. The idea is that if you don't want to finish a bottle of wine, you can use this stopper to reseal it. No, apparently, there are people who don't feel compelled to polish off a bottle once it's been opened. Here's a funny thing - Eddy Grant has accused Gorillaz of ripping off one of his tunes : Grant says Gorillaz copied his 1977 song Time Warp on their new single. "I am outraged that the Gorillaz have infringed the copyright of my song Time Warp, claiming their song Stylo to be an original composition," he said. Breach of copyright, eh? Now, there's something the RIAA are always quick to have something to say about. You only have to try and remember what a song sounds like, and the BPI will hit you with a lawsuit for copying the music to your cerebal cortex without the correct licence. Clearly, Grant's publisher, EMI, will be fuming over one of its artists having his copyright abused, right? [They] said it was "a private matter between Eddy Grant and Gorillaz". Oh. Um... well, what about Gorillaz's publishers? They, surely, won't sit back and be accused of stealing copyright - that's like stealing hangbags, remember? [They] said it was "a private matter between Eddy Grant and Gorillaz". Oh, yes. It turns out that, at least, the publishing arm of EMI aren't actually that upset at the thought of copyright being abused at all. Indeed, it's nothing more than a "private matter". Perhaps they might like to have come to this conclusion before the BPI tried to write UK legislation in the Digital Economy Bill.
