Massacres by the US Terrorists. A letter from a U.S. soldier stationed in Iraq, Describes the Gross Massacres committed by the US, during their assault on Falluja, heres one extract of the letter ... "And why should anyone think that a complete victory is possible?

"I was on an escort mission, accompanied by a squad whose task it was to protect a high brass figure in the combat zone. This particularly arrogant officer went to the last battle in the same spirit of an impartial spectator checking out the fourth quarter of a high school football game.
