Students excavate a kiln at Cheung Ek, Cambodia. Photo courtesy of Phon Kaseka Cheung Ek is infamous for being the site of a Khmer Rouge killing field—some 20,000 Cambodians were murdered here between 1975 and 1979. Yet Cheung Ek also has a much older history, and today a team of archaeologists led by Phon Kaseka of the Royal Academy of Cambodia is investigating what lies beneath this once horrifying landscape. The team has found that Cheung Ek was settled around 300 B.C. and played an important part in the emergence of Southeast Asia’s first great economy, the mysterious Indian-influenced civilization known as Funan. Centered in the lower Mekong floodplain, Funan flourished from about the first to the sixth century and eventually gave rise to the well-known kingdom of Angkor, which culminated in the 13th century. According to Kyle Latinis of the University of Cambodia, “Cheung Ek may be one of the pinnacles” in a complex of sites. Both Roman and Chinese historical texts record trade voyages to Funan, and archaeologists have uncovered artifacts from Rome, Persia, India, and Greece at the Funan port town of Oc Eo, now located in southern Vietnam. Archaeologists also have investigated another important Funan site, Angkor Borei, in southern Cambodia. Kaseka’s team is just beginning to investigate Cheung Ek, but it has already discovered 61 pottery kilns strung out over a distance of three miles (five kilometers). The kilns have been carbon-dated to between the fifth and seventh centuries, making them the oldest uncovered so far in this part of Southeast Asia. If the kilns were all used around the same time, that would support the idea that Cheung Ek was a major pottery producer—and therefore critical to Funan’s economy. Local potters likely made several kinds of pots, including spouted vessels called kendi, which were used for storing and pouring water, perhaps in ritual ceremonies. Archaeologists can learn a remarkable amount about ancient technology and trade from studying kilns and the waste that can be recovered from them, such as clay debris and pots broken during manufacture. By examining the chemical composition of the clay debris and then testing kendi pots from the same time period that have been recovered at sites across Southeast Asia, the team hopes to determine the extent of Cheung Ek’s trade network. Like many other Funan-period sites, Cheung Ek may have continued to be occupied after the decline of Funan and well into the era of Angkor. A mysterious large, almost perfectly circular earthwork dates from at least the tenth century, and the team is testing several hypotheses as to its design and purpose. Work has yielded stone inscriptions, architecture, brick temple or shrine foundations, and other features characteristic of later periods. Kaseka’s team is eager to continue excavating the site’s kilns, temples, and houses, but it faces difficulties.  Cambodia is recovering from its violent past under Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, but the recovery process is proving detrimental to the nation’s cultural heritage. Growth has been rapid and often uncontrolled, and the external demand for marketable artifacts has intensified. Urbanization and looting are destroying Cheung Ek's history. “Action needs to be taken now,” says Kaseka. As part of a new generation of Cambodian scholars, Kaseka wants any fieldwork plans to include community education, and he wants to find ways to persuade developers and looters not to destroy the site or any others like it. Sections of Cheung Ek have been preserved as a site museum, a memorial to the horrors of the killing fields. Now efforts are being made to preserve the parts of this site that could reveal so much about Cambodia’s distant past.
