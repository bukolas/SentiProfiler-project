But these are not very comprehensive and have to be supplemented by rules each society consider necessary. These are the rules of morality and rules of law. Whereas the internal rules need no implementing agency, the external ones need agency to implement them. Early on the group leader was the authority for this purpose. During the course of time the village elders, village panchayts, the chieftain of a county, the king, the Emperor and the Government became the implementing authorities. Any one familiar with law enforcement will know that 99% of people have to be obedient to law under internal compulsion not under external threat of detection and punishment. This is usually achieved by indoctrination from childhood onwards during the course of education or otherwise. Here comes the role of religion. Every religion is a moral code. Observance of the moral code is essential for the faithful to attain whatever may be their spiritual objective. The very high percentage of faithful among humans is, I think, based on an internal programme built into our genes. No religion will stand the test of rationality. One needs a very high ability to suspend disbelief to be faithful. My theory there is an inbuilt gene, which ensures this for the majority of people. There are many other essential roles that religion plays. It relieves our fear of death and life after death, it gives hope for the hopeless, it makes it possible for one feel bliss due to religious fervor which like other human moods (happiness, sorrow, grief, pain, anger hatred, etc.) needs an outlet. It satisfies the need for performing rituals, which seem to have a psychological impact on humans. I am not aware of any society, which does not resort to rituals.Â
