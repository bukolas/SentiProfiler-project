................When I woke up in the morning I always become aware of my thoughts and feelings and work to 'shift' whatever it is that may not be what it is that I am wanting to attract. Usually it just takes a sec and the beautiful thoughts arrive as I hold onto them and go about my day.

This morning my mind was going a million miles an hour and it was not comfortable! as I laid there the ugly thoughts kept showing up! Frustrated I pulled the covers over my head, closed my eyes real hard and tried to focus on something good. Still the sickness feeling was there and I began to get annoyed that it was more difficult than normal. 

Then it hit me as I thought of my friend Kat's birthday today then realized what day it is!!! 

A Year ago today my life was changed forever!! A year ago today I felt terror like i have never experienced before or after. A year ago today was the best and worse day of my life. A year ago today my husband shot himself after trying to kill us both. A year ago today my Husband gave me the greatest gift ever. My freedom!!!! A year ago today I gave my word to Tony (the sheriff) that I would make good out of the bad and I have!!!
I hate to vent on the blog because people who vent are sad, lonely creatures who cannot handle their emotions and/or thoughts in a socially acceptable way, thus inflicting their stresses upon the many terabytes of data floating in this universe causing an as-yet-unknown form of verbal pollution.

But I have to vent.

Recently, I've been going out with angmohgais / guai loh / expats. Am I an SPG (Sarong Party Girl)? Yes. In fact, twice when I went out with angmohgais, I wore sarongs. The point is, its not that I don't care - because I do. I am hardly independent enough to not need validation from my fellow countrymen. But I resent this greatly.

Of course, we could do this the legal pad way. Pros and Cons, Compare and Contrast, et al. But why would I when the comparisons are so painfully obvious? Because, otherwise, I would get such hair-raisingly predictable responses that I would forever regret this diatribe.
seventh: you know when people talk to you and they mumble so much you have to say "i'm sorry. what?" or "what?" or "could you say that again?" or "i didn't hear you. what?" what what WHAT??? one day i'm going to look at someone and say "take the marshmallows out of your mouth next time you speak. i can't understand a damn thing your saying." seriously. i've noticed it a lot lately. speak up people!! either i'm going deaf (which is totally possible considering the only volume i consider appropriate for music is loud) or people literally are too damn lazy to open their mouth and move their tongue to make audible coherent noises.

eighth: go to www.theoatmeal.com and browse. hysterical site.

ninth: i had a crazy dream where tornado's were talking to me. and they wanted to kill me. they were mini tornadoes in some kitchen i was in and they were talking to me and trying to kill me by chucking knives at me. cassandra was with me. then the power went out and we got on our hands and knees and quietly snuck out. all the while the tornadoes were saying "where are you??" all creepy like. we get out and my brother is standing out in the hall looking out a window, being a creep, and he says, over here! and as the power comes back and the lights turn on, knives were thrown in the kitchen. but we were already out so we were safe. so sandra and i escape to hide in the bathroom to sit in the tub (bc that's what you do in a tornado...you sit and wait it out in the tub). then she's like, what about your brother? and she goes to look for him. while i continue to sit in the tub. i hear a knock at the bathroom door and i open it, and in walks my parents. naked. and behind them comes ben and sandra (fully clothed). and i wake up. weird. does anyone analyze dreams?? b/c i have a lot of weird freaky ones like this all the time.

tenth and finally: the bathroom floor at the gym i go to is disgusting. i honestly don't think they ever clean the bathroom. however i've noticed the janitor sweeps the basketball court every morning. i'm tempted to say to him "how about instead of sweeping the basketball court for the millionth time, you hose out the damn showers in the girls locker room??" i'm not even asking him to mop. i'm merely asking he gets rid of all the hair and lint by hosing it down the drain. is that too much to ask??? also, the same sink hasn't worked in 3, almost 4 weeks. as well as the same soap dispenser has been out of soap for the same amount of time. they truly never go in there. it's disgusting.
Some days the idea of getting a shrink makes real sense to me.  It's not usually about MY shit though- and I'm not sure one should hire a psychiatrist to, essentially, gossip about the people in your life.  

Then again, that could be the bread and butter of the entire profession, considering how FUCKING ANNOYING people are.  

Also...  If it drives me nuts, it IS kinda my shit, huh?  I mean, I'm sure the details speak volumes.  

But I'm not getting a shrink because I have you, and you're free, and I'm already accustomed to the stigma of blogging.  

So.  (I do wish I could lay down on a tufted, leather sofa to pour my heart out, though.  See what you can do about that, would ya?) Saturday night some schmuckla hit a pole, causing a power outage.  -No big, it was the middle of the night, after all.  

But the sump pump runs on 'lectric, and it has been raining its ass off for daaaaaays at this point, so guess what!  Water in the basement!  

It could have been much worse.  Much, much, much worse.  If the pump had just given up, for instance, and the electric was still on, I'm not sure what would have happened with the speakers.  They're probably older than I, and they sit straight on the floor.  Seems like it could have gotten sparky down there.  

As it is though, we probably took on about 4 inches, and almost everything stored down there was in water tight bins...  Almost.  

A couple of boxes of ESPN The Magazine *EYE ROLL* got soaked, along with a smaller box of Rolling Stone Magazines from The Grunge Years (I can obviously understand this loss better, but still.  Magazines?  Jebus.)  And last but certainly not least, two boxes of Comics.  

They were the first thing he went for when he realized what had happened, and I heard him cussing all the way upstairs.  -What the fuck are those little jackets for, if they're not going to even try to repel water?  I mean really!  (Do not explain dust jackets.)   Anyhoo, he heaved the boxes onto the lower landing and bellowed for me.  

And I went.  

And he asked me (being generous because I know he was freaking out) to GENTLY  remove the jackets and lay them out on the extra table to dry.  -They ended up covering the whole table and 70% of The Sunofabitch Room floor.  

Some time later.  

I don't know if you know how difficult it is to GENTLY wrestle thin, wet paper from a wet plastic sleeve...  It's not fun.  I patted them down, examined them for damage, and did my best to facilitate their drying...  

"They're ALL ruined!"  he later exclaimed.  

"Listen.  A few of them got hit really hard, but a whole lot of them only got an edge or a corner damp- they'll dry out just fine."  

"But they're still ruined!"  he huffed, somewhat childishly, in my very humble opinion.  

"Well.  I did the best I could."  I tried really fucking hard not to bite his face off.  

"It's just...  I mean, they'll never be worth anything again, and these aren't mine.  They're BiL's and CJ's, mostly.  They're just ruined!"  

"I do hate to ask, but...  If there was never any saving them, then why did I have to climb all over the floor, patting them tenderly all morning?!"  

I can't tell you how many times I have sat through The Comic Guy Discussion.  -Different Comic Guys have different beliefs on the treatment and use of Comics, and believe me, it's a long fucking story I don't wish to subject you to, if you've been able to avoid it this long, but it boils down to:  Some guys collect for value and bragging rights, and everything they have better be in mint fucking condition or somebody's gonna pay.  Don't touch it!  Don't bend it!  Don't breathe on it!  Then there are guys who collect for the pleasure of reading them and looking at the artwork.  This I understand.  

All of these guys are that guy, just so you know.  

And they treated them a bit questionably before they dropped them off here.  Not horribly, like they're known to treat almost everything they come in contact with*, but not with any extreme care.

Ward did not mistreat them.  He wasn't careless.  The basement has never fucking flooded.  

It's now Wednesday, and he still has The Face, and he is STILL FUCKING WHINING ABOUT THE GOD DAMNED COMIC BOOKS!  

Please.  Just stab me in the fucking eye.  

*The fact that there's a trail of destruction behind them adds to my difficulty in understanding the DEPTH of the woe here.  

It's not cool to abuse other people's things, and I am bummed for them.  But hopefully AFTER THE FUCKING HOLIDAYS we'll be able to start replacing them.  We'll make it all better, ya know, like they did after they broke my favorite vase.  

Oh wait, no they didn't.  So should I subtract that $120 from the bill?  No?  Because I already said, "It's all good, man.  Accidents suck, but they happen."  

Wasn't someone supposed to stab me?
So I have had a few people who are on my page that I don't know all that well ask me if my relatives were the founders of the town I live in....LOL No! 

My first husband's last name is Powell and he and I have three kids together, so I felt it was important for me to hyphenate my last name to add their name. The social security office told me I have every legal right to continue to use Powell as my last name, or part of my last name, so I feel like as long as three out of my seven children have a different last name then I do now, I should find a way to be able to use both names. So I legally changed it to Powell-Sanschargrin, Sanschargrin being my married name now. My maiden name is only used on Facebook.

Now, what a huge coincidence that Mark and I happened to buy a house and settle in a town that is called Powell! When we decided to buy a house in the Knoxville area and we were looking at houses on-line when we were in Italy, I seen this town and laughed! I made the comment to Mark, and I was totally joking when I said it, "We should buy a house in that town!" Wouldn't you know that our real estate agent had a bunch of houses in this area to show us and we really did end up buying our home here! Everyone joked about it...My oldest daughter said she couldn't believe I ended up in a town called Powell... But we love it:)

So there you have it! I was not related to the settlers of our small town. As a matter of fact, I know absolutely nothing about this town or how it even got it's name or when it was founded. The odds of me ending up in a town that happens to share the same name with my ex-husband, I'm a little bit curious about that.
I know I am on hiatus to a point but I had to share this!
I recently participated in a junk swap at Junk market Style. I received my package on Saturday from my delightful swap partner Avery. She is an art teacher who uses junk to make jewelry and assemblages. Perfect partner. I know you are completely jealous. Just look at this fabulous stash I received!!!

You wish you were me right now, no?

You really must not drool all over your keyboard.

I knew this one would get you! Fantastic piles of yummy junk.

What more is there to say?

She even took into consideration my fascination with everything pertaining to the Sacraments.

Now I need to put my thinking cap on and start creating. Avery, you are the best! You need to start a blog and show us all the creative things you do with the junk you find.
Once again I was lame and forgot to take pics before I sent my box out.  Hope she enjoys what I sent as much as I am enjoying her selection. (Sadie and I keep going through it all as if it was a treasure chest filled with diamonds.) To us it is!

Have a treasure of a day, P.

BTW I temporarily added the eggs to the wooden piece Avery sent. I am loving that piece! It may become my permanent centerpiece to play with through the seasons!
Well the flights are booked, the hotel is booked, the new poster is ready and all the visa waivers etc are in place. Montana here I come!

Of course this means that the pile of work that needs to be done before I go is looking incredibly large and is marked with URGENT!!! It's a flippin' good job that I work well under pressure. I'm getting there with my dissertation though, and the reading at least looks interesting.

In some ways I can't believe my time as an undergrad is almost over, three years has gone so fast. But also, now I think I'm ready for it to be finished. I've got my PhD research idea niggling away at me and I'm eager to get started. I'll be sad to leave UCLan and the friends I've made there, but I'm looking forward to a new beginning.

In the meantime, I still have a couple of adventures left to share with the gang. Montana being the first! :D
So, on my long run of the week I like to contemplate things.......the meaning of life, what I'll be wearing the next day, what I need to shop for on-line......you know. Important things: Where is that road to being a good person I was looking for the other day?? You get the idea.

Well, last weekend I was jamming to my uber cool running mix which you better believe includes Jay-Z. Have I mentioned that our romance back from the Hard Knock Life days has been rekindled? As his voice soothed my soul, I was trying to picture Jay-Z sitting down to write some songs............and I started laughing out loud. I mean, does he list out words that rhyme? Is he pulling out his pocket thesaurus?? I'm just having a hard time picturing this! I think it must just come out perfect when he goes to the studio the first time. That is the only way it can work out in my mind.

I used to write poetry in high school, which colors my ideas about brainstorming and writing or doing anything creative. Cheers to Jay-Z for beating me at this process. I never tried to rap though. Maybe that's easier. I should add free-style rapping to my list of goals I have going. More amusing things for you to read about.

Pretty sure I'll need to pick the optimal time to test out this free-style rapping, like, oh, I don't know, maybe during an interview. I will be going on lots of those soon. My future employers will need to know that I'm creative. Perfect way to show them! Or maybe I should do it at HEB the next time I go and almost die by being stampeded in the dairy section. Those people are on a MISSION I tell you. I have been trapped there on multiple occasions. I'm sure if I were rapping at people they might make a path for me, my eggs and my milk.

I'm not lying when I say that I observed a very painful first date on Millionaire Match Maker which included a free style rap from the girl to the guy. He decided she was crazy. Maybe I'll be better than her.

Well, I should go review common rhymes and do some brainstorming so I'm ready when the perfect opportunity presents itself. Does that negate the free-ness of the styling? I'm going with no.
In real life, when my friends split up, I have a really good track record of staying friends with both sides. I have done it pretty successfully here on MySpace too.

We are all flawed, every one of us.

The longer we know someone and the more we see of them, the more we learn about their personality, quirks and character. We see the good points and the bad points and if we love them, we accept those things as all "part of the package".

Recently some real-life friends of mine were going through a really tough time in their relationship. Stacey was afraid her boyfriend was cheating on her and she was confiding in me a lot, because she knew four things:
- that she could trust me
- that I would listen but not tell her what to do
- that I loved her boyfriend and knew him very well
- that I would tell her the truth

What was really interesting was the out-of-character behavior that she displayed during her melt-down. She became crazy jealous obsessed girlfriend. 

She hacked into his computer, his Facebook and his cell phone messages.
OK so I have been really enjoying all of the creative blogs on SITS and Lady Blogger Society (Thanks Katie), but I am finding myself lost in blogs and ignoring the family, YIKES. Any of you that have kids know what happens then. Those wonderful children know that you are ignoring them and reek havoc on anything and everything.
So I joined Lady Bloggers Society and I can not get the badge on my profile it keeps telling me there are invalid characters or something I don't know. I will try again . If anyone has any advice please let me know.

So last week I friend requested my biological father and alas he ignored. I know this because his wall is public and he recently became friends with other people but not me. Does this bother me? I don't know, I am kind of indifferent to the situation. I don't know him wouldn't even be able to recognize him if he walked into the room. I guess what bothers me the most is the situation I am in, in having to explain this to my children at some point. The man that raised me is my dad. My one and only dad, but he has his own issues and baggage with his family and did not adopt  me, which is fine with me(those that know them will know why this is fine with me). So I have my biological fathers last name but that should have left me when I got married , so you would think.
When deciding on my married name I did not like the sound of it, and I was not ready to totally give up who I thought I was of it so I hyphenated(SP?) it.  Consequently not one of my children has truly noticed that my last name is different then my parents.  Even my twelve year old hasn't noticed but I guess at this age she is just too self absorbed to notice anything but herself.  My son did bring it up in the car one day and I blew it off cause how do I explain this ?  He may be a little too young to understand.  I should probably talk to my dad my real dad not the sperm that helped to create me and ask him how he would like me to deal with it when the question comes up again.  Just some thoughts on a WACKY WEDNESDAY!!!!!
The weekend has arrived at last. After a long week of school, everyone looks forward to Friday - Sunday night. Especially this weekend. Today after all the classes are finished it is the start of Spring break for Oakland University. The weather has been so wonderful and it has made this week coming to an end something magnificent! whether you are going to a famous Spring break spot or you are staying in the comfort of your own home. It is going to be a time to catch up on some much needed sleep and even possibly some homework that needs to be caught up. I am going to enjoy my weekend with my mom and younger siblings, I am heading up to see them all tonight and will be there all weekend. It is going to be a much needed relaxation. Enjoy your weekend everyone! =)
I guess you could forgive someone for looking twice in a mirror. Maybe to verify their perception of it the first time. But this was different. I stopped, turned around, walked back and then proceeded to waste fourteen and a half minutes attempting to catch my reflection at it's own game. I think our reflections are more than the shallow, beauty-obsessed clones of us they seem to be. That's a fair observation to hold mind, I mean what do we ever see our reflections doing?

Combing their hair, applying lipstick, adjusting their skirt 'just-so'. Really? No i think there's more to them. It just seems so close minded to assume their only purpose is to help us maintain our unique level of good-looking-ness (and I can only speak for myself here but I don't even remember the last time I had a successful view of my reflection). Perhaps we all have a little Dorian Gray in us. Perhaps we all use them for our own selfish ends. Maybe we do maybe we don't, I guess I'm not sure what we use them for. It's just nice to know when you feel completely alone, there's an equally frustrated person on the other side of the looking glass, albeit she'll likely have better hair than you do..
I am a dreamer and a bookworm; creative and somewhat adventurous. My sense of direction lets me down every time. I am sickeningly organised and have an ongoing love affair with lists. One part diplomatic, one part blunt. I can be stubborn and opinionated, but I'm lovely really. Give me handbags and shoes anyday. Especially shoes... Beautiful, shiny shoes with neverending heels that I can't wear for longer than ten minutes. Oh and lovely dangly earrings too. I do not smoke. I drink socially. I love chicken and pasta and a good steak, but cannot eat garlic and onions. If this were not the case, I'd very seriously consider being vegetarian. I love sunshine and I even secretly love rain. Mostly I love the smell of wet grass after the rain. And thunderstorms. I was born and raised in Malta; I moved to England in '06; Married my best friend in '08. We intend to live happily ever after.
My husband was supposed to be at work at 1:30 p.m. today and he ended up late by nearly an hour.  Why?  Daylight Saving Time took effect this morning at 2 a.m. and neither of us knew about it.  I suppose we should have known, but we do not have cable and Hulu, Myspace, and any other websites we have been to in the last three days did not even give any noticeable blurbs about it.

I was under the impression that Daylight Saving Time was begun for farmers, because that is actually what they would tell us in school, but I think they were neglecting world history and trying to claim it for America.  

In reality, Daylight Saving Time was established in 1916 by Germany and Austria in order to “conserve fuel needed to produce electric power” That’s right, the same people responsible for Nazism and the Holocaust brought us this gem…
I know that I can't stay like my current life as cooking and studying music but English, but hunting job. 

Don't be worry! I'm getting better and I can do what I wanna do. 

I'm getting interviews from a few companies next week. What I can do is that just I talk about myself honestly. So, I don't wanna prepare something as I seem to be competent. I have confidence and I can do anything if I want to. It might take a time a bit though. 

Whatever, Daddy, I have some melody for you and wanna compose it. Would u forgive me to do it?
Then I would be workaholic.

Aki
be happy to Everyone
However, the relationship between Edward and Bella is potentially dangerous to young minds as it gives women the idea that the Edward/Bella relationship is real. Even as I was reading the book, I felt a longing for something like that...something I know does not exist. And, as I have the knowledge and experience to know that my marriage is incredibly deep and encompasses more of the aforementioned passions than many, it is a little frightening to think of the expectations that a young, romantically inexperienced woman may pull from this series.

And that is why this series is irresistible. The action is never-ending, giving the books an urgency. The love story is timeless, capturing the hearts and minds of its female readers. And, though Breaking Dawn does fall a little short in comparison to the first three books, the final book is destined to be the lesser as Bella's transformation from vampire to human will ultimately be tragic unless it is even more far fetched. Then again, we are talking about vampires...

Overall, I'd give the series a "read." After doubting it for months, it surprised and pleased me far more than I'd expected.
Things have been going well out here. Unfortunately, I don't have very steady wind but I'm still managing to make some progress. Its starting to get really cold! Its still quite possible that I'll be up on deck reading a book when rounding Cape Horn, but I'm beginning to think that while out there I'll be in an Eskimo suit...not a swim suit.

I was surprised by how fast the temperature changed. Just two days or so ago it was nice and warm but all of a sudden it got right down to 60F. Its not just the temperature that has changed. Everything around me from the constantly breaking waves to the grey sky is different. Not more than three days ago there was still the bright blue water, clear sunny skies, and warm wind. Things may not have started to roar the minute I entered the 40s but the past few days have made it evident that I'm in them.

Its cold, and rather then everything being bright blue as it had on the equator, everything has now turned grey. Its an all together less inviting sight than the equator, but its exciting and it feels like I'm really getting into my trip now.

I've spent the day checking up on things; belts, filter, lines, and sails. I did a little housework as well. I cleaned out the cupboard under the sink, pulled out some warmer clothes so they're easy to get to when I need them, and checked out all three of my heaters to make sure they're working. I've also been working on drying out my boots. They got soaked inside and out so while covered from head to, well, ankle, in foulies my feet have been very uncomfortable when I'm outside!!

I've been keeping the boat closed up tight and compared to outside its very warm (I'm not sure the temperature outside, my thermometer is down below). With the companionway door closed the windows fog up and the roof is wet from condensation. I usually leave the one little window above my bed open. It does let in a little cold breeze but I'd rather a cold breeze than suffocating. I have had quite a bit of time to think out here. Suffocating would be a pretty miserable ending to my trip so I'm really very happy to put up with a little cold air!

I know a lot of you are watching the wild weather that is brewing down here. More on that tomorrow.
I will not stop till I have this figured out.
Healing is my priority.

I've come a long way from the days of eating Entemann's cakes and drive thru food on the sneak.
I'm no longer "addicted" to diet soda, caffeine and coffee.

Every time I knock down an unhealthy habit I expect to feel great relief.
I am not greatly relieved as yet
BUT and every one loves a big BUTT....
I'm still plugging away at this.

I do not accept "food addict" as a label. Thank God I didn't.
I do not accept low calorie diets and overexercising as the answer to obesity.
I do not accept being tired all the time as normal.

I'm fighting the good fight.
It was probably about four or five months ago when I applied for a job as a valet attendant, so this post has been long in the making, but it came up again yesterday afternoon when I was talking to some other students about workplace dress codes.

I was looking for some money on the side while I go to school, so I put in my application and was called in for an interview.  Everything was going great - I have a clean driving record and I drive a stick-shift, so I was feeling pretty good about it.  Then the interviewer got around to the dress code.  I would have to wear black pants, a plain white dress shirt, and... a tie.
I gave him an incredulous look and said, "I'm a woman."  He pointed out that he was wearing one and I told him, "Yeah, and it looks silly enough on a man, let alone on a woman."  Needless to say, I did not get the job.  I didn't want the job anymore and would have turned it down anyway.  I almost wanted to ask him if he would wear a skirt if that was the dress code... I wonder what he would have said.

This may have seemed a petty issue, but I feel that a dress code is being most sexist when it attempts to wipe away our sexual identities and make women emulate men.  If women should be forced to wear ties to earn a living, then why not make men wear heels?  I know for a fact that a woman in a skirt can be just as polite and can drive a car just as well as she could if she would wear pants, so what gives?  If they want sameness, they might as well get plastic surgery and melanin injections for their employees as well, just so they will all look exactly alike - don't stop at clothes!

The funny thing - this was at a Catholic hospital... and unless they don't hire any women, they are about 80% likely to end up with lesbians working there with this sort of a dress code.  Let's be realistic - if a man gets hired there, he probably already has a tie and white dress shirt, but a woman would have to go out and buy these things.  I can just imagine going to the men's section in JCPenney and getting fitted for a dress shirt, the guy standing there and trying to figure out what to do about my boobs...
Now, something you may or may not know about me is I love to dance. I mean I reallllly love to dance. Not nasty body grinding dancing, but just moving to the beat of the music. Or in my case, more often the beat in my own head. Turn on a dance song and I transform into what looks like a crazed jumping bean. Some of my friends on the retreat had never seen this before. There was a lot of "Where do you get that energy?," "I've never seen you so excited!," and ".....whaaaa....?!?!"

I think my biggest fan is Lindsay. She cannot believe my dancing, or the faces I make while doing it. She's seen me go crazy enough that now, she almost immediately runs to where ever I am in the room when a song comes on, and we act like idiots together. Our energy and excitement is infectious, and eventually, most everyone around stops worrying about how they look, give in, and join. There's the jumping, the swimming move, the running in place, and of course, the fist pump. All with a huge smile and bright eyes.

Do I look silly? Definitely. Do I care? Not at all. Do I sincerely love every single second? Absolutely.

The point is this-I truly believe that dance parties are one of life's ways of saying "Hey, I love you man." You can forget all your problems and stress, let down all your inhibitions, and tap into the unafraid free spirit that is in all of us.

So the next time you hear a good song, don't think about who is watching or what they'll say.
Last night, and a few hours of this morning, were spent in the ER because we thought I might have appendicitis. But let me explain a little bit of what had been happening before-hand. A couple months ago my back started hurting, lower right hand side, really bad. It went away for a while, but then a couple weeks ago it came back, so my DI dr. put me on a lactose/gluten free diet. That seemed to help until Thursday. I threw up that night and my back and lower front side started hurting really bad. I was afraid to tell my mom about and decided to just not tell her for as long as I could bear it. Yeah...that lasted until about 11 AM the next morning [yesterday]. Last night Amanda was here and she was talking about my symptoms to my mom and looked them up on WebMD, and decided I should go to urgent care, just in case. We went, and he sent us to the ER with a note saying appendicitis needed to be ruled out. ...I think that pretty much sums up why we were there...
Hospitals are quite the learning environment. For reals. I wasn't scared about being diagnosed with something, so much as being sent home with another, "We don't know, we can't find anything wrong." I've been through that, a lot, and I *hate* it. I think the longest wait ever was waiting for the results of the CT scan. I prayed and prayed for God to give me peace, strength, and comfort. Finally I said to my mom, "I'm scared." I had brought my Bible along, in case I got lucky and it was appendicitis, and I would have to stay there. I have an insert in my Bible about God's mysterious side. I got that out and read this part of it:
Yes, this is directed at all of the people who have ever said "FML" at a problem so minor as ruining their hair. & Yes, I AM NOT saying that I've never had a bad day, or something that I wish hadn't happened, or gotten mad over something miniscule. I have had MANY bad days, I have wished MULTIPLE times that things didn't happen, and I have gotten upset over tiny things too many times to even count. But the thing is, I'm starting to see how stupid all of that is. We are so lucky and we don't even realize it!!!! We could be in India, forced to hide under long black shawls and constantly told that men are and always will be better than us. We could be in Russia, a starving, toothless homeless child left to freeze out in the blizzarding snow. We could be in Africa, malnurished, infected with HIV/AIDS, and watching our children die before us, just waiting for our turn to come. I think that it is time that we ask ourselves, "Are our problems REALLY that big of a deal? Would we rather be doing seemingly pointless homework, or standing outside a schoolbuilding, yearning to be allowed to go inside but never getting the chance to? Does a ruined hairdo even compare  to a death-stricken family?"
For everyone reading this, I don't want you to ever think I'm a hypocrite if I ever accidentally complain about something that isn't that bad. I am human, I have lived in this well off town my entire life--I don't know anything different. I know for a fact that I WILL, sometime in the near future, be angry about something that I know in my heart I am lucky to have. But I am saying right now that I am making a conscious effort to be more grateful and appreciative of the things I've been blessed with, even when they don't seem like a blessing. All I have to do is think about the kids who don't have them, and how very blessed they would be if they did.
I was fired from my job on January 8, 2009.

Last week was really weird. I was sort of in the past and in the present at the same time. I was remembering the awfulness of being in that job, and the shock and fear at losing it.

And then congratulating? myself on not getting fired from this job. Thinking about how much better off I was out of that other job. How I should have quit right away, that the crying and no sleeping was never worth it. Thinking that I don't cry at this job, but I still can't sleep. Wondering how far I'll make it through the year. I'm pretty sure I'm not at risk of firing (bad pr, you see), but do I really want to make it all the way? How much longer can I go without sleeping well? How can I last another five months when just about every day I am exhausted and out of patience?

I got home that night last week and there was a package for me. I hadn't ordered anything, so I was very curious what on earth it could be. Turns out, it was an art book that has one of my photos in it! That certainly would not have happened last January, and it certainly couldn't have happened without what did happen last January.

I wonder where next January will find me?
Who knows how to make love stay?

Next, she thought, “When two people meet and fall in love, there’s a sudden rush of magic. Magic is just naturally present then. We tend to feed on that gratuitious magic without striving to make any more. One day we wake up and find that the magic is gone. We hustle to get it back, but by then it’s usually too late, we’ve used it up. What we have to do is work like hell at making additional magic right from the start. It’s hard work, especially when it seems superfluous or redundant, but if we can remember to do it, we greatly improve our chances of making love stay.” She was unsure if that idea was profound or trite. She was only sure that it mattered.

Over the weekend, a friend and I worked on something special to send to Andrew overseas. It's a bit silly and a whole lot of wonderful.

How do you work to make love stay in your own relationships?
These last two weekends have been full of friends, laughter and general good times. First we had a long-awaited "Malteser" dinner here in Roch, which we thoroughly enjoyed. 

Last weekend, we spent a lovely couple of days in Reading for the wedding of my friend Kate and her now-husband Tony. We had an absolute blast - I haven't danced that much since my own wedding... and it was a bonus to have some cooperation on the part of my feet this time round!

On the way back home, we stopped at Hampton Court and went for a leisurely walk by the river and reveled in the sunshine for a couple of hours. 

On another note, the job I mentioned a while back unfortunately didn't work out, so I am back home restarting the job hunt once again, but this time making certain to enjoy the free time I have as opposed to resenting it. 

Fellow blogger Allison over at In a Nutshell wrote these words yesterday, which perfectly sum up the way I feel right now:

"Let this post serve as a simple reminder to myself to make the most of each day, and to be utterly thankful for the days that I have here under the sun and the stars. Let it serve as a simple reminder to bask in the beauty of this world and to let its warmth drench my soul."

Next week, I'll be painting our bedroom! You know what that means, don't you? More random wall and paint pictures to come, lucky lucky you! *wink*
Well it was a normal Sunday morn'n till I see a calf trotten across the front pasture. I knew that Cowboy Steve was working some cattle down at the barn but when snot (the guard dog) was going crazy, I went to the door to yell at him to quit and there it was about a 600 pound steer.  Cowboy Steve and Cowboy Stephen both got injured while the big calf was escaping from the shoot.  Stephen our dear friend ended up breaking his ankle while they were trying to wrangle the beast to the ground and Cowboy Steve has a few broken ribs.
You know those people that post things like "I wish I could go back before everything went wrong" , "I have tons of homework-FML", or "I'm sick of all of this crap, it's making my life horible." on their Facebook statuses or Myspace updates or whatever? THEY ANNOY ME BEYOND BELIEF. We as Americans, living in Boerne, which, while it may be a little dull, is nice and safe and clean and better than a lot of other places. And we HAVE NO IDEA how lucky we are. Drama at school will pass, get over it. It is truly not that big of a deal. I'm so sick of hearing people complain about things that others would count as blessings, like the fact that our school cares enough about us having a future to give us homework and tests to help us learn, grow, and be able to do whatever we want with our futures. Did you know that out of the 11 million childen in Africa, only 18% of them graduate from primary education, which is to us, Middle School? They have no way of acquiring a job, they can't use knowledge to figure out life problems-they're on their own, and so many of them long to be educated, while we sit here and complain about the people who take time out of their own days to teach us and help us achieve the next highest degree of education. I'm not saying I enjoy the homework, or the tests, or the long, boring hours spent sitting in school, but i look past all of that and see the big picture. I appreciate what my teaches are doing for me, and I wish that more of my peers would do the same.
Well, it's 2010. A new year, and a new start most would say! But is that actually the way it goes? Not often! My Christmas was quite good, I spent it at home with the family as mentioned in my previous blog. It was nice enough, only a small amount of us. The younger siblings got what they wanted, and I got some small but pleasant enough things also :) I didn't do much to celebrate new year. I've never been one to go out and spend £40 or so on drinking myself into a stupor, to celebrate the coming of a new number on a calendar etc..Why do people feel the need to celebrate new years? What exactly are we celebrating? The coming of a good year? How do we know it'll be good!? I've never understood it. I'd rather celebrate at the end of the year, to how good/bad the year just ending was. That makes more sense in my book. So this year was just a quiet one, sat in watching the fireworks in London on the TV. Do I have any New Year's resolutions I hear you ask? No! Well, that is a lie to some extent. I have no *new* New Year's resolutions. Over the past few years I've said the same every midnight of the last night of December.

"This year I vow to lose some more weight, eat healthier and be happier"

I think it's fair to say that this year, I intend to do the same all over again! 


When I look back at 2009, I half cringe, and half grin. I was a little lost at the beginning of 2009; I didn't know what I wanted, where I wanted to be, who I was. My life started to take shape by the end of the year, I made some *genuine* friends who cared more about life than drinking, I got close to some very special people, and I changed as a person, which I'm happy about. What more could I say I want from 2010 than to develop on this? Whether it's to do with my new found changes in myself, or just a growing maturity that's hit lately, I'm starting to notice the little things in life a lot more than I ever have before. Today I was walking to my house, the ground was white from where the snow had landed, and I noticed the crunching noise that you get under your feet from walking on snow. This evening I cooked myself an unbelievably nice tea, consisting of salmon, new potato's and veg, and I noticed how healthy the food tasted, how it lacked that horrible fatty lethargic feeling that's left behind after your average pie and chips. If there is anything I want from 2010, it's to have a bigger appreciation for the little things in life, for the people around me, and for what I have. That's my 2010 resolution.
I am so proud to be part of my good friend Paul Bradley's show, "Dreams."
He has worked his butt off and has assembled an amazing line up of incredibly talented folks!

I am honored to be playing the very colorful role of the Mother Hen of a Whorehouse, her name is simply "The Black Widow." She is kind of like "Annie's" Miss Hannigan meets "Missing Person's" Dale Bozzio. LOL ;)

Congrats to Paul Bradley & the cast of DREAMS as we showcase 30 minutes of his script tonight at the prestigious ASCAP Disney Workshop.

WISH US LUCK!
Now. According to google analytic there's a bunch of people stopping my here daily, and blogger tells me that 40 of those people are following me. This makes me shiny-giggly-happy and I would like to know more about you.
Where are you from? Do you have your own blog? What is your favourite word? If you were a time of the day, what time would you be? What are your top 5 favourite things in the world? Tell me, tell me, tell me! I'll start:

I'm Linnea, I'm from Sweden but have lived in Edinburgh for 5 years now. This is home.
I am DEFIANTLY Thinking positive!! It's my Sister that is in need of prayer As well as my Mother. My sister Bobbi is the one in the family who has chosen to follow a not so honest path! She has been in and out of Jail & prison for multiple reason mostly drugs and theft. She in detained right now and had collapsed THREE Times when...  they finally took her to the hospital after she tried to hold herself up as she was blacking out AGAIN and ripped the toilet out of the jail floor. THEN they took her to the ER!!! They did a CAT on her and was tested positive and has a spot on her brain. Then they TOOK HER BACK TO JAIL!!! I think that they should take this more seriously!!! Don’t you? There are family members that do love her. I am trying to hold good thoughts for my mom because she is not that strong unfortunately. Please Pray for them both!! XOXO THANK YOU!
This post is personally for you, but don't worry about all the other people who may read this, they are very nice internet non-stalker people. I actually think I am the only person on this blog website who isn't writing about babies, families, families making babies etc etc.

Now onto business! If you happen to have read my previous posts, you will know that I am on a mission to get your attention, for the sole purpose of getting the hosting job on the new US X Factor. I cannot tell you enough how much I want this job, it would be the ULIMATE gig for me, and I know without a doubt I would make you and all of SyCo TV proud, and I know I am the best person for the job.I know people start blogs for fun, and this too is fun for me. But I am also very serious about wanting this job. Throw me a challenge, see what I'm made of. That's my request to you good sir!
And now I will leave you with a little visual parting gift to brighten the rest of your day, and keep you rockin!
Well helllloooo!! Do I even have friends anymore? LOL It’s been so log. Well, life with two kids has been an adjustment. My cooking has revolved around simple casseroles and incredibly sweet things. A weird thing about breastfeeding is that you get to keep the pregnancy appetite. Unfortunately, I just don’t have the time to devote to recipes like I did. I have to work in intervals before the baby needs me. I love her to pieces.

Awww. I know right?! LOL Ok, so last semester I took an Honors Composition course. The professor mixed ecology in with the class and focused on the Locavore movement. If you don’t know what it is, it’s the decision to eat food made only in a certain radius from your own home. We tried this as a class. Half of the class became locavore and the other half remained everywhereavores LOL. At the end of the semester we all got together and made a dinner. The most interesting thing happened! Those who could get anything they wanted only brought in a chicken, potatoes, veggies, and a case of water! Our locavore group brought eggplant lasagna, fish tacos, guacamole, salads, homemade honey papaya ice cream, and smoothies! We went ALL out and it was awesome. I learned a lot from that class. I try to find local produce as much as possible now. So what better place to go than the Florida Strawberry Festival?! 

Ok, ok, so aside from the strawberries, nothing seemed to be local. And NOTHING was produce. Chocolate DIPT bacon. Fried BUTTER. Donut burger. I was in foodie overload. If you want to know what a deep fried Snickers bar and deep fried Oreos look like: 

I STILL have indigestion from those damn things and we went LAST weekend. :D 

So the Strawberry Festival wasn’t exactly what I’d recommend for someone looking to eat locally, but I did buy some strawberries from Plant City, which is in the 100 mile radius of my own home.
I remember so much about the island; the large Lighthouse that helped me fall asleep so many nights as I counted the flashes of light, that were a steady pattern all through the night, reassuring me. If I woke with it very dark soon that beam of light would move across me and my room. This light shined up to 20 miles out as it swirled around warning ships that they’ve come to close to those deadly shoals and often chasing away the nightmares of my childhood. She was strong and comforting. Funny I call her a she?!


 I remember the sky; often full of puffy white clouds, lying on my back in the sand, or stretched flat floating in the water, looking for pictures in them. I remember the sunrises leaving u to anticipate the day and sunsets, so rich in color often leaving one breathless, vibrant colors; reds, oranges, shades of pink and purple swirling or streaking across the sky. I often found myself anticipating the beginning of such a beautiful show, free of cost.   At night the sky was more often then not clear, the moon strong and bright(really there was very little need for night lights, street lights, or security lights,) the sky full of life, with thousands of stars to gaze upon, too many to count, and many a falling star was searched for.


I remember a rich childhood full of many blessings!
i might be moving back to california, maybe in the spring. i don't know. one minute i'm awful excited, the next it almost brings me to tears. i just got started back in school, i have friends there.. i have the potential of having a life.
i just don't want to move again. but maybe it could be for the best.
i'm so unbearably lonely, all the time. i sit at my house waiting for him to decide i'm worth picking up for a moment or two. i hate leaving my house in fear that i'll miss my chance when he actually wants me.
every time i leave to go anywhere, with the exception of school, i get extremely panicked and anxious. i don't know what to do with myself.
i think it's pathetic, how i'm still the one cast aside. the one who's proved loyalty, honesty, devotion.. versus the one who used you 'just to see'. i know things are rough for you, i've been through it with you the whole time. but i can't handle this. i know you care, but i need it to be showed. i need to be taken care of sometimes.

she used you, used us.. the same way she does with everyone.. you won't ever see it, you won't ever realize. but it's the honest truth, everyones else knows.
i mean, who else can go in.. destroy the perfect relationship between two people in love. just as an experiment? to see if it would work?
then a month later, decide. 'oh.. well i didn't actually feel that way. i just wanted to see. i thought so, but i was wrong.'

i'm not even going to lie. it's awful what you and her have done to me. but being who i am, go figure i'd cast it aside. continue to be there for you BOTH. i'm so devoted, my life is spent doing what you want, or need. i take care of you constantly, and i don't even mind. i just wish you'd notice. i love you.

since i've met you, you've been the one thing that i completely put myself into. the one thing that i always think about, the one thing i always work to do for.
on my birthday at disneyland, i told everyone i felt sick with a migraine because you said you were upset, and everything with your dad that day. i didn't want to not be available for you.. i didn't want to not be able to be there for you. so i came home. on my birthday, just to be told that you were going to sleep.
i bought you that $100 stuffed kangaroo so it would be shipped to your house before i left, just so you wouldn't be as lonely at night without me around.
and every day.. i talk to you when you want to talk. i leave you alone when you don't. i'm at your disposal.
and then, i do what i can for her as well. i take care of her when she's drunk as all hell, i take care of her emotions. i'm nice to her. when she back stabs me. im still there
Two blogs in one day, oh well I explained briefly in the previous one as to why. I hope those that read this will understand and be patient with us. We now have a internet device which plugs into my computer. So we hope to be in communication more often. Weather and other things can  effect it but well when you are rambling from place to place. 
There is something many of you do not know. There is a second blessing in this Florida Ramble. I am going to be delivering The Diary of An Angel to three Angels along the Ramble. For those that are not familiar with this, my dear friend Halkios has started an incredible project that involves around 100 artists around the world in the form of a Diary. I invite you to go to his page in the above link to read more about the Diary and see what others have written. I am blessed to be one of the "Angels" and even more blessed that I get to deliver the Diary to three of them. Now due to "bumps" in the road the Diary did not arrive until after we had started our journey so it was actually delivered to the first Angel I was to meet on this journey by U. S. Mail but I met her first and was able to enjoy that glorious event which I will share in a moment. Though I will meet and share with you other artists along the way, I can not tell you how special it is to be able to share with you the Angels of Florida. It is amazing how close we all feel even though we have never met in person. It is that way whether they are photographers, painters, writers, singers, or poets. The artistic spirit binds us like family. The passion of our art transcends differences. How these artists inspire me, how their works lift my spirit, how much I admire them I cannot find words to express. But I am so honored to meet them, and even more honored to share them with you.

You killed me last night.

In a dream.

There was is so much anger inside you. I was sleeping, Dakota laying close to my heart, his breath strong and easy against my face. In contrast, it was the sound of your haggard, fervent breath closing in on us, that woke me. Panic leaping through my body, racing to my throat, choking off words. 

The look in your eyes, so much rage, passion, undeniable heat. And while my heart knew that these would be the last few beats to ever pound against my fragile frame, I remember thinking, where was that intensity, that blazing inferno when I needed it most? When I needed you most?

You killed me last night month.
It wasn't a dream.
Arrived in Stockholm all smelly and hungover. Got back in the game with some beer on my brother's sunny balcony.
My family drove up from Varberg to celebrate my sister's 20th. The birthday girl herself was hungover and tired, but the rest of us were happy bunnies.We ate, drank, walked, laughed and did the kind of stuff our family generally does. My brother took great joy in trapping me in revolving doors, my dad told rubbish jokes and we overdosed on garlic.
 haven't been to Stockholm in the springtime since I was a toddler. I was born there, but my family moved down to the westcoast quite early on. But I still have the same relationship with Stockholm like I would with a hometown. Hatred mixed with passionate love. The accent can drive me mad, I get sick of having to correct people when they assume I'm from Gothenburg, but every time I leave I feel like crying. It's odd. I still don't think I could live there for any longer amount of time, but I do love that city. Love, love, love.
 And this time round I got to meet lovely Anna for a coffee and discussions about love, life and everything, which made me happy.

I'm back home in Edinburgh now. It's so much warmer here, no snow, and plenty of spring flowers. I've got a horrid headache and loads of uni-reading to catch up with. I guess I should get round to it.
We’re all haunted by something. Much of our lives are spent dealing with one haunting after another. And some of us are haunted by almost everything that touches us. If you think that you aren’t haunted by anything then you don’t have a past and you never made a bad decision; and good for you.  I think about what haunts me a lot, maybe too much.  I know I’ve thought about it a bit too much these past few days. Sometimes it seems that my humanity is strangled by the things that haunt me.  Sometimes it seems that all that’s left are ghosts.

I don’t think haunting is as much about regret as it is about the reality that we make up for ourselves.  Most of our demons are self made – for a million different reasons.  My regret for a love that I lost is all tied up in memories that may or may not be totally accurate at this point. Those memories are all colored in hues determined by feelings and tears, seen through a broken lens of time and sadness. Heartbreak: this is the haunting of loss. 

I think about why I constantly run from the prospect of love, and I can only explain it as a haunting.  I’m haunted by the idea of loving someone as much as, say, a song that touches me so deeply I can’t stand to hear it. I avoid it because I can’t bear feeling something with an overwhelming deepness that engulfs me. This avoidance of feeling is the haunting of beauty.


 
In my interviews for the Mike Williams book, so many people have told me their stories – their sadness and regrets and their sweet memories of friendships and loves lost.  They all say something about making bad decisions when they were young – as if they were the only ones who did and now they have to apologize to someone – to themselves – for it.  Even after I remind them that everyone believes they have made horrible mistakes, they still feel the need to apologize to me. Not giving ourselves a break – this is the haunting of the past.

When I started writing this, my life was very different. Now, only a few days later, I see that there are so many other things that can haunt: loneliness, doubt, silence. I wonder now if those things have always been with me, only hiding when I have something to lean on and reappearing when I’ve lost the ground under my feet.  They are there to define me by my weaknesses whenever I stop walking through them long enough see them and remember they are there.  And just like ghosts, as soon as I stop allowing them to be, they disappear again.
Dear Mom,

Here we go again mom. I'm stuck in your mememory sometimes, and ever since you died, I think about you everyday. Im not stuck in the past though, dont confuse it please. I have completely moved on, I believe. I've found when I look at your pictures, or pictures of us that I am happy. I enjoy seeing us together or seeing you when I thought you were happy. I try to pretend that you never left that your still here, or one phone call away. In reality, your not, and will never be. Which does in fact scare the shit out me. I try to face the fact that your gone. That you never got to see who I am now, or what I will be one day. I wish I could show you everything. Better said in his words:

" I know if I had one more day, it would leave me wishin still for one more day with you"
Don't let anyone tell you what is right or what is best for your life. Do what is best for yourself and follow your heart. Stand tall and stand by your decisions, but always be prepared to admit your mistakes and admit when you were wrong.

I have made a big decision in my life about my future. My family and friends have been very supportive of that decision, but there are some people that haven't. At first I let it get me down until I realized that I am the one that has to live my life and no one else can do it for me. So, I shouldn't let a few non-supporters choose the direction of my future. I have to do what is best for me. You should do the same.
Anywayyyyyy. Last Sunday I spent most of the day over at Amanda's house. I brought her a birthday gift, that she was so surprised to get! I had been sneaky and ordered a limited edition Belle and Chip ornament that she wanted but wouldn't buy for herself. And we re-arranged the spare bedroom in the house. It kinda became a "catch all" type room and that's not cool. We were going to do that a couple months ago and never got around to it. After that we went to Koch Arena and saw Maroon 5. That was the other part of her birthday gift. We were approx 4th row. About 10 feet away from Adam Levine. Good times!

Thanksgiving was okay. My sister was sick. My aunt/uncle and cousins came over and ugh, my aunt really drives me bonkers anymore. She brought 30 pounds of turkey (and a bunch of other food) for 9 people. Can we do the math on that? Whatever. My cousin Tori, who is only 7 years old, wasn't feeling too great while she was here. At some point she got feeling worse and ended up throwing up. She was miserable, but my freaking aunt/uncle didn't feel the need to leave. She threw up at least twice more before they thought to take her home.

After they left...I noticed the time and hurried outside in time to see the ISS and Space Shuttle Atlantis flying over. It was right on schedule as the news had reported it would be. Definitely one of the coolest things I've seen in a while. It only looked like 2 very bright lights moving across the sky but still very cool to watch.

I played phone tag with David all week. He called me on Monday to invite me to dinner that he had planned with Virleena. I've never been a fan of that girl, so I held out for my own dinner plans with him. We met up at Cheddar's on Friday night even though I felt like total crap. I'm convinced that I was exposed to the flu on Thursday. David's wife was very nice, though the language barrier was difficult. She's Japanese, and speaks way less English than I expected. David seems quite content with her, which is good. Stephanie was there too. I love that girl like a sister. She's had a rough time this year, 22 years old and divorced. I'm going to make a bigger/better effort to keep in touch with her now that I have her number again. Hanging out with the Lewis siblings is exactly what I needed. A dose of 2 of my favorite people on the planet. No matter the time apart and distance between us, it's like nothing ever changed. There are things I would've liked to talk with David about, but it just didn't happen. Oh well. Unfortunately, I won't get to see him again during this visit. He and Natsumi are headed back to Japan tomorrow morning. It always bums me out to know that I won't get to see him again for months on end - but life goes on. Something funny though, David is one of my best friends, but I learned something about him that I never knew! Not an interest - just an off the wall amusing fact.
THERE WAS SO MUCH THAT WAS GOOD

Ultimately, not good enough, on one side or another, but pretty nice while it lasted.

My first husband, Bill, wanted a motorcycle goddess wife with toddlers floating around inside the white picket fence. The motorcycles were all right by me, but not the toddlers. And the man was hung. I hadn't set out to marry a guy who was hung like that, but I was not about to turn it down when it happened. 

I wanted to smoke hashish every night when I got home from work at the Welfare Department, and have cream of wheat for supper and finish my Master's Thesis. And occasionally...oh, never mind.

It is indeed a different world than it was 40 years ago. Grinnin' Sinner chastises me for not realizing that things will be even more inequitable twenty years from now. I don't understand his point. Unless he's hoping that some of us who have a few dimes and quarters to spare might subsidize his book.

Hey. Listen. I recycle plastic drinking straws and live in a tiny house in rural central NC. Not Los Angeles. Works for me. So quit fussing. Ultimately, it sounds as though my (and/or others) taxes pay for your subsistence. 

That's okay. Unless you put me down for going along with the system that pays your way. In which case, you might want to hush. Or at least blush.
I'm so far behind with my blog writing that there is no use trying to make up for it. I do want to document some of the fun things that I've done recently though.

A couple weeks ago a bunch of us got together for a "friend family" dinner. Amanda and Ryan, Audra, Laila, and me. Something we haven't done since the summer! We went out to dinner and then back to the Ashby house where we helped Audra put together the wedding gift she should've made a couple months ago. All the while we were listening to Johnny Cash music. Good times!

Last weekend I met up with Angel and we acted like 14 year olds. Seriously. I'm 26 years old and I lived through the boyband craze in the 90/early 00's without being one of those omg-i-will-cry-because-I'm-so-excited type girls. I never stood in long lines or camped out overnight to get tickets to something. To be in the middle of a crowd like that was really entertaining. We stood in line at a movie theatre for an hour so we could get good seats to see The Twilight Saga: New Moon. Really, it's kind of embarrassing to admit that, but we did it. And at least we weren't the oldest people in line. :P Drooled over Taylor "Jailbait" Lautner for 2 hours. I liked the movie, because it was true to the book. At the same time, the book was my least favorite of the series. For me, seeing this one was just a requirement to start waiting for Eclipse next summer. I know I'll love that movie, for sure, and it will probably make me cry. What? I have a soft spot for Jacob, and his pain.
My heart is beating whenever I see him, It’s too hard to hide it.

I don’t remember since when. He was not my type. He is too tall for me and I’m not good at typical handsome boys.

Might be I like him. 
He makes me smile a lot. He makes me happy always.
I wish he wouldn’t pretend.

I can’t make him smile and 'm not his interest. 

It‘s sad.
Why is it that the second a song becomes heard of, be it by a friend, your whole group of friends, or even the media in general, suddenly you feel you own the right to it. I often worry this trend is becoming more and more popular; what with the ease through which we can download music these days, pretty much everyone has access to the same music as everyone else. Nothing remains personal, it's all out there and once it hits the mainstream and gets overplayed you know there's no going back. Suddenly that song that's stuck around your top 25 most played for the last 4 and a half years, is suddenly the one that makes you want to tear your hair out and fill your ears with cotton candy every time you hear it played.

Perhaps there's a bonus to this though. Our natural instinct to solve problems kicks in, prompting us to ensure there's music out there that we can always keep personal. Now I don't mean we should go and kidnap awesome artists and bands, I'm talking about originality. When we dislike the way someone makes our drink what do we do? Make it ourselves: make it better. There's nothing stopping all these people who complain about the lack of less mainstream music from getting their hindquarters off of their computer chairs and going out there to make their own. Music actually is EVERYWHERE. What do we need to make it really? A little creativity, and despite how much people may disagree I think it's fair to say everyone maintains a pinch of that. Everything we say throughout the day comes from our own mouths (hopefully), we create our words. Our inner sense of who we are creates a personality for us. There is no such thing as a lack of innovation: there's another special word for that. It's just pure laziness.
As it has been college Spring Break here in the Sunshine State Capital (Ha, sunshine state...yeah right!) I have had and abundance of spare time while at work seeing as all the students aren't currently on campus to bother me.. In the branch, there is a TV which scroll's the company's "top news updates" or well...its opinion. BUT, today, something on it got me very excited. Just half-heartedly watching the entertainment new updates, suddenly my eyes were WIDE open, they are now making a movie out of the book i JUST finished reading, Something Borrowed by Emily Giffin. Though it is by no means a literary masterpiece , it is a book that sucks you in from the  her best friend, Darcy, who was the "it-girl" all her life, handed everything she wanted and getting any boy she wants. On Rachel's 3oth birthday, she is still singe (despite her plans to be happily married with children by then) while Darcy is engaged to Dex (a handsome, charming, intelligent man Rachel went to law school with, and introduced Darcy to because she thought she didn't have a shot in hell). After a long night of drinking and partying for her birthday, she finds herself in bed with beginning. It is a story of a tell-tale good girl, Rachel, who has always been a good friend toDex the next morning!! (No worries, I didn't ruin anything, all this info is on the front cover!!) The rest of the novel (or well book, not so sure it deserves the term novel) is the story of the decisions Rachel and Dex must make following their mistake that night. Well not that the synopsis is over, i shall tell you why I was so excited... Ginnifer Goodwin was chosen to play Rachel in the movie-adaption of the book! she is absolutely perfect! She is beautiful, but ofter times over looked, and seems like a wholesome sweet girl! Maybe also because I felt like the character of Rachel is based off of how my life will be when I'm 30, I truly related to her...BUT another exciting part...John Krasinski is playing Dex! Not so sure how he'll pull of the tall dark and handsome thing...he's cute not handsome. but he is a fabulous actor! I will give an update on who the rest of the actors are when I find out! And more updates as the movie progresses! But that was my RAVE for the day!
everytime i look at those pictures, everytime i hear the name, everytime it just crosses my mind. i feel like i’m going crazy, all these thoughts bouncing from edge to edge in my mind. always there, but at least sometimes they’re skirting around the edges instead of blaring straight into my thoughts.

my heart drops straight into my stomach, same feeling every time. almost like how it feels when i take my pill.. but it’s like. the bad version of it. the version that causes me anxiety instead of getting rid of it.

my thoughts are one giant cluster fuck, i’m sick of this thing every body else calls life.

i sleep whenever i can, because my constant night terrors are better than dealing the cold hard truth that is reality. i can’t handle this, and that’s all i know.

“Its a bad night to be alone, but thats the way it goes.”

i hate the feeling when you're full on sleep, too the point where all you want is to just sleep, but your mind is going through the awful thing that is thinking. nothing else sounds slightly okay. sleep is the escape from a bitter reality.
It was never so much what he said, it was what he did not say. He woke up and got ready for work and said nothing. He came home from work and changed his clothes, lay on the couch until dinner and said nothing. He came to the dinner table with a newspaper and read it instead of talking to or looking at his children. After dinner he lay on the couch and watched television until he went to bed, saying nothing. I mean this literally. The man could go for months and say nothing to any of his kids. He tried very hard to ignore my mother as well. When I was in my teens my conversations with him revolved around him telling me to pick up the telephone, or that a friend was at the door, or to not play the music so loud, and basically that was it. Not only did he emotionally cut himself off from me by not speaking, he rarely made eye contact with me either. (This is also how he treated my brothers, although as the only girl, I got the worst of it)
Please enlighten me:
Why, my dear friends, is it that I develop a raging sore throat the entire five day stretch of night shift? And why haven't I called in sick?
Is there a reason my labs ferociously shake and whine when it's time for breakfast, while my mutt won't leave the bed?
Come to think of it, why do I have three dogs?
Why do I want to sleep all the flippin' time?
What is it about a banana that just isn't complete without peanut butter?
Next explain to me why a woman expects me to believe that her water broke, when she's really pissing her pants?
Purposely, may I add.
What am I doing writing here when I told myself I'd bike six miles to the river?  Are the exercise gods going to curse me!?
A cup of joe, music, and my cat = my recent comforts. Anyone care to explain?
Why do I feel that that I am missing something big,
and please explain
this disconnection.
My last post made me realize that I've made it easy for myself to bash relationships and friendships simply because they never worked out the way that I wanted them to, and that I should instead look to the friendships that touch my heart and keep me, for the most part, sane. So I'm going to dedicate this post to Gwen.

My favorite book happens to be Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Corny, I know. But the reason I love this book, aside from the mother-daughter-feud dynamic, is the fact that friendships can last throughout the years. Friends can stay friends, even if at some point or another they end up threatening each other's lives. It is possible to have a friend to go through life's stages with, and still be able to sit down one day when we're old and gray over a cup of tea (most likely laced with rum) and talk about how our years progressed and how we changed so much.

The person I see sitting across the table from me when I'm old and gray would be Gwen. Sure, there are other people I want sitting at that table with us, but for the most part Gwen is the clearest image I can see so far.
Having found myself with an unexpectedly free day, I blitzed next week's lesson plans, wasted some time (as usual) on the net, then thought "OK, what now?"

A quick squint in the kitchen cupboards gave me an idea. When one of my flatmates recently moved out, she left behind half a jar of peanut butter (hope she didn't want it back!) Can't stand the stuff on its own, or on bread, but I hate waste so I (w)racked my brain trying to think of something to do with it. DING! Peanut butter cookies! Google searches told me I probably needed butter and eggs, but I had neither and no money to buy any, so I cobbled together the contents of various vegan versions from the net and set to work. Flour, peanut butter, bicarb, sugar, olive oil, cinnamon and nutmeg were all whipped together in a bowl which may have been a little too small resulting in bits of the mixture regularly flying out of it and across the kitchen. But finally I had something that I looked like cake/biscuit mix.

As there are no baking trays here, nor did I have any greaseproof paper, I had to turn the main tray from the oven upside down and coat it in butter! Thus making them not completely vegan, admittedly.

But nearly an hour later, and with the kitchen fairly coated with flour, there were 16 blobs that vaguely resembled cookies happily baking. And 12 minutes later, there they were. Now I have to resist the temptation to eat them all! I think my student tomorrow morning will be getting a little present!
Hecate's Own is getting done. The rain hit, days worth of it, and damn near knocked me on my ass. I'm over a week behind where I wanted to be this year and I've already adjusted my self-imposed schedule to accommodate the suckiness that has been weather in the Northeast. 

Feh, as my friend Bob would say.

I've broken 50k and hope to hit 60k soon. Meat Grinding will then commence, then it's off to the Betas and on with Norwegian Wood!
Father and Grandmother are coming back from the Univ hospital. They wanted to donate their body after their death and they were in hospital.
Actually I felt complicated about it in my mind. We had no choice. It's their decision. We had to succeed their will whatever.

Father was incredible man. I’m really proud of him. 
He was tough, laid back and warm-hearted. 

He worked for Japan defending air force and was placed at Okinawa base alone at a time. I was at the age of puberty and avoided seeing and talking with him. When I got my ears pierced in my high school, teachers had warned strongly and asked stopping cuz such attitude was against the moral of the school then bothered other students. Mother also nagged me and slapped my cheek hearing from them; however, Father was on my side. 
He said "it doesn't make sense your behavior makes other students annoyed. it's too conservative. A thing for only sure is that you hurt your ears by yourself. You just have responsibility for yourself." I've never forget it and I won't.  
He was really really great man.
I've spent whole spare time with him at his end of a year following him anywhere it's even rugby school. He loved rugby and I figured out he encouraged many kids to be just as they are. At the same time he took a note small things like A could pass the ball to B etc. then he gave kids their possibility and complement. It made them fun to play rugby. 
He changed much.
When I was in Canada a few years ago, he had written to me to say sorry cuz he was strict during my childhood.  
He had a second thought about the way to raise children while he was coaching kids to play rugby.
He was thoughtful, changeable and modest. 
Anyway, I miss father so much. Then I want to give him my appreciation and apology for much thing.

I can't help crying. I imagine he would try to act, fight and tackle like playing rugby in the next life.  I'm sure.
Then he always keeps watching me. I'm sure. 

I'm sorry that I couldn't see his body burned.
 
Can I say that? Dad was given the medal by the Emperor but I'm sure he wouldn't feel nice but must've been happy 30 kids’s visiting him at the day of his death. 

When he was diagnosed cancer, he had reported to his friend he was happy for getting cancer cuz his 3 children came back to him. After his death when I found such an e-mail I couldn't help laughing and shedding my tears. How funny it is!! Right?

My best friend told me that only good memory would be left in my mind in the future. I wish I would. Mostly I feel like that. That's why I feel sad. I hope we talk about him smiling with my family left. 

It's kinda my mourning work.
Today I finished the rough draft of Hecate's Own! WOOT!

When you look at the word count meter it will tell you I still have roughly 2500 words to go before I hit 60k. Well I can tell you I'm going to break the 60k mark in the Grinder. I already know I need at least two more love scenes. Some questions remain unanswered that really should be in this book. Some questions should be added or deleted for the third book (which is looking more and more like it might be Gareth and Gen rather than Daniel and Kerry). And the final fight scene needs some beefing up.

So yeah, by the time I'm done I'm pretty sure I'll hit around 65k. I'm planning on hitting that mark by Monday, at which point I send this off to the Betas. Think I should warn them?
A “thaw-and-serve” meal is the industrial version of the TV dinner. It’s the kind of meal that comes out of my cafeteria hotline. Preparing the meal involves thawing it in the oven to about 160 degrees and then serving it. The stuff can go from frozen to ready in twenty minutes. Hamburgers, nuggets, chicken patties, mac and cheese, and pizza are all “thaw-and-serve.”

Cooking is nearly extinct in the school kitchen, and it makes me wonder how this happened. Once upon a time there were family-style meals at my school with food that was baked, sautéed, or roasted. “Thaw-and-serve” didn’t exist.

Making egg salad traditionally involved boiling and peeling eggs. It’s time and labor intensive: pulling the eggs out of the water when the yolks are fully cooked, uniformly yellow, and not tinged with a green ring takes skills.

Today, we never have a problem with sulfur-y, overcooked eggs. Our egg salad starts with hardboiled eggs in bags that keep for a surprisingly long time in the fridge. The eggs are perfectly cooked and peeled every time! Who knew that you could get eggs like that? Not long after seeing eggs in a bag in my school kitchen, I spotted them at one of my favorite grocery stores.

In schools, food isn’t the priority, clearly. Often times, it isn’t in our homes either.

Part 2: How my school went from family-style meals to “thaw-and-serve” feed lots.
Did you imagine them? Good.

I remember the day I was heading back from Columbus and stopped at wendy’s to purchase some chicken nuggets for the drive.  A "new menu item" caught my eye and I decided to live dangerously and try it out. 

These nuggets were delicious!  

I continued home to toledo and went to wendy's the next day in order to procure some more of the delightful nuggets but soon found out that they were only a limited offer in a limited area.  

If only I had known I could have bought more of them just outside of Columbus.  I’m sure they would have traveled well being 98% preservatives and 2% outstanding deliciousity. 

That was the last time i would have the opportunity to shove those reddish chunks of deep fried heaven into my face.

Here is my proposal.  We all need to post "bring back wendy's spicy chicken nuggets" in our status updates.  

Enough of us together can make a difference!

We need to use this great opportunity to take back the power they're trying to steal from us!

I’d like to point out now that by kudoing you are agreeing to the terms and conditions contained within this blog.  if i find out later that you used your status update to promote your own market agenda legal action may (or may not) be taken!

I’m not saying everyone "has" to do this but i'll probably think less of you if you don't.
So today's been somewhat of a lovely forecast outside, the suns beaming, and theres a slight wind, but comparing to the amount of snow we've gotten this year, this weathers brilliant. And yes, im stuck inside rehearsing my song for the competition which is 3 days away oh joy. Well i've had some what a productive day to say the least, i arose at 6 o clock to find the sun would like to come out at this time, and as i was staying at my dads, my sisters curtains arent at all that thick, so i was kept awake from that moment on, around 9ish i decided to drag myself out of the pit (Y). I took a lovely stroll to the shops with my father to take the only advantage i could of this weather, cus god only knows what its forecast tomorrow! I've decided to give the kitchen a new look as i seemed to drop bolognese sauce everywhere, i guess i thought i could multi-task whilst holding hot food, turns out... i can't! I also helped Jes with her little issue on blogger, so i feel accoplished that i helped someone today without even leaving the house (Y) score. So yeh, now im sat, writing out all the lyrics to the song that must be learnt to take to rehearsals later on with my mentor, and not having a printer actually sucks. And to top it all off, my college prospectus' have arrived now i need to actually choose which one i wana go to. I have no idea. Tbqh, im happy not being at college oh well :( pub tonight? much deserved i say ;D
So today went really well which made me ecstatic. I barely smoked. I maybe had 3 again. I didn't have the urge to drink; the taste of alcohol is no longer in the back of my throat. I had full meals all day, which later on down the line will help with losing weight. 

There are two new goals I would like to this life changing choice.

One is:
Lose weight. I'm not unhappy with the weight I am currently at, but I know I could be smaller. So, starting tomorrow I am gonna start walking and watching what I eat. Eating healthy won't be an issue, because if I tell my mom that I want to start losing weight, she will buy me healthy food.

Two is:
Abstinence. Yes, that's right people. I am going to stop having sex. I am tired of guys only wanting sex. So from here on out, I'm going to truly see what it is that guys really want.


If you can't accept the above, please don't talk to me. This is decisions I have made that I will accomplish. They are all to prove to myself and to better myself.
Jeans today - You know what that means: WORK BLOGGING! Thursdays are my favorite day, and just can't be ruined with the restraints of dress pants. I know, I have set goals, which include wearing dress clothes to work Mon - Fri, but lets live a little. According to People: Style Watch, jeans are appropriate in the work place when paired appropriately.

I couldn't help myself, anyway. Club Closet was in full effect as I was getting ready for work this morning. If you aren't familiar with Club Closet, you are in for a treat. It includes one DJ (me) who is also the featured artist, two to three dancing fools (me, husband, and possibly attic man) and our small walk-in closet. We were rocking Lady Gaga. As a result of the atmosphere in said closet, People: Style Watch might tell me I didn't pair appropriately.....but I'm over it.

"Who is Attic Man?" you might ask. I think it's time for me to share about how I'm convinced that someone is living above my apartment in my attic: Attic Man. His existence is quite convenient for me. Let me give you some examples: Where did I put my keys? Attic Man! He must have moved them. Why is no laundry done: Attic Man! He hid the dirty clothes. Where is the remote control? Attic Man! He was probably watching MTV or BRAVO while I was at work, and left it somewhere weird. You get the picture.

When Attic Man's existence is not convenient for me, however, is when I'm at the apartment alone. Suddenly Attic Man turns really creepy and could come out of the attic access in the closet at any moment and take me up into his lair with him. And I don't even want to picture that creeper up in my attic, living in the dark.

Attic Man is pretty quiet for the most part and doesn't usually cause problems-just when he leaves the dishes on the counter or in the sink or drinks the rest of the milk. It's debatable as to whether or not these things are indeed Attic Man, or someone else that lives in my apartment with me..........One time, though, Attic Man caused the light fixture in my closet to mysteriously fall to the ground in the middle of the night one time. That was on the more creepy side of The Attic Man Saga, more of which I'll share later!

Viva Club Closet, featuring VIP Attic Man!!

Until next time!
Wow, this is Bruce! I just put that in the mail on Monday!  I do apologize. After I already sent it, Terri said that the video was poor because of camera placement. She really made it for us to hear the audio. I did not see a copy (I got it Sunday night). Let me know if you want a better video.  I hope you like it all!
I’m having one of those days. You know the ones where you feel like utter crap and life lacks purpose. I’m having one of those moments where I realize I can’t keep doing what I’m doing and expecting the same results. You can’t wait around for someone to change things for you. It will never happen. In the end you can only really depend on yourself. You are your own ambassador and mascot. You control how your life is lived, what you do and say and ultimately your own happiness and success. I have been very fragile for some time now. I have let people, circumstances and things get on top of me. I have got used to being emotionally weak and sensitive and have not challenged myself to stand up and fight. I am far too nice and people take advantage of it. I can’t blame anyone but myself because I have LET it happen. I don’t want to loose that soft side of myself but I do need to learn to protect it when I need to. 

My anxiety has gotten worse and worse to the point where I have become agoraphobic and it has started to consume and run my life. I miss being me. I miss being the sociable, bubbly, crazy, fun, free spirited party girl. I miss my old friends who I haven’t seen in so long, and my best friends who I only see every couple of months. I miss a love life. I miss working fulltime. I miss having hope in my heart. I miss my life.
 
From this moment on I need to show myself that I can be STRONG. I will not let anyone put me down or let anyone tell me that I can’t do something. From this moment I shall seek out my own happiness. I shall seek out my friends and loved ones that I miss. I will get on TOP of my anxiety one step at a time. I will confront my fears HEAD ON!!
 I am a deserving human. I deserve happiness. And with my family and friends beside me I know I can accomplish anything!
One of my closest friends was extremely homophobic when I first met her. It’s not something she understood and she felt very threatened by it because of that. I never judged her for this but as we became closer friends and she got to know and understand me she became much more open. She is now one of my best friends and no longer feels threatened by bisexuality/homosexuality. If anyone needs someone to talk to about this subject feel free to email, comment or message me. If you disagree Id be happy to have a lovely debate with you. :) I am always willing to listen to other peoples point of views. And remember LOVE IS LOVE people.
I am a volunteer at a local hospital. This started as a way for me to get hours for my nursing application. I have since completed the hours needed for that application, but I have stayed on, both as a means of experience and as a set amount of time each week that I can have freedom from the little girl and she can have independence from me. But I digress. I have much enjoyed my volunteer time, feeling both valuable and productive in the world. Today (though I did feel both those things) I experienced what I had not been missing from the working world: coworker irritation.

There is a particular clerk who has asserted himself quite clearly as superior in any circumstance he can. While it's true that he has been accepted into and been attending the nursing program that I, myself have applied for, I hardly think this qualifies him as superior. For starters, he lacks tact, compassion, and approachability, and these are not just by my own judgement. There have been instances (beginning the day I met him) that I found him less than courteous, but I'll focus on today.

I had been instructed by another clerk that I could log in to the computer system with their password, and as I had been asked to watch the desk today, I did so in order to have access to the most current patient list for incoming phone calls or visitors. When the previous clerk above returned to the desk, he proceeded to reprimand me for this in a tone that was accusatory and derogatory. I am not opposed to criticism per se, and I would certainly want someone to inform me if I should use a different method, etc. I am a volunteer and don't presume to know everything, but I am appalled at the tone and judgement of this clerk. He is just downright rude. And let's face it, I'm working for free. Doing his job. How about a little gratitude!
Busy. Busy. BUSY. 

Little time to think, even less to feel. Except at night. Thank God you are too exhausted to keep your eyes open for very long, so the tears that fill your eyes don't make it to the pillow before you fall into restless sleep.

You feel like your ass has been kicked emotionally and physically; that fall up the stairs was just what you needed to wrap up the week. 
Sigh.
Now it's Saturday night and.......
let me just start off by saying:
do not. i repeat. DO NOT go to the bathroom when there is NO toilet paper to be found in the house. that is just not a good situation to be in. trust me. just experienced it first hand. it not only makes you angry, it makes you sad. and confused. b/c it's like, "wtf do i do now???"
but i digress....
just practiced some guitar. have my lesson tomorrow. i'm a really bad music student. can i just say that?? i like, never, practice what i'm really supposed to. i just practice whatever i want. that's prob why my technique is so awful. i should really be playing my book stuff. but i don't. b/c that's boring. instead i have printed off tabs and am practicing that. haha currently trying to learn bubbly by colbie caillat. i have kinda taught myself every rose by poison as well as blackbird by the beatles. i can't play them WELL. but i can muddle my way through them. i should prob practice what i'm supposed to though....eh. moving on.

contemplating keeping in contact with my bro...it's a tough decision for me to make. i've talked to him a few times while my rents have been in england...(oh ya ps, my rents are in england and i've been house/dog sitting). i feel guilty but at the same time am so angry at him. it is quite the conundrum.
this week was week one of working out. i have gotten up every morning at 530 am and gone to the gym for an hour. then i went to work from 830-6 ish every night. i'm pretty tired. but so proud of myself for going! :o) but it's not going to do much good if i can't change my diet. hahaha prob should work on that too....one thing at a time! i have cut down on drinking! lol i don't drink every weekend anymore. just a couple times a month. lol that's pleasing.
omg i got pulled over! ya. totally forgot that happened. it's a $90 ticket for running a red light people. so don't do that. if my insurance goes up i might be livid....
has anyone else noticed that i just merely ramble when i blog??? lol i just did. there is no point whatsoever to this or any other blog i've ever written. hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha i just talk and talk and talk about nothing. lol!! i'm literally hysterical as i write this. lol lol lol holy shit. *sigh*
that's all i think....probably going to bed now. lol
oh! i have a subscription to Cosmo. :o) *smiles* love that dirty magazine. ha!
until next time.
On a happier note, It's Snowing!!!! I know, I know, you think I'm crazy, and your right. Normally, around this time of year, I would be complaining about snow. I would be wining and crying about how cold it is and how much I wished it were spring. The problem is, we haven't had any good snow storms this year. If it is going to be cold there better be snow on the ground, and I don't mean a dusting of snow either. If it is going to be cold I want it to be cold and blizzarding (which apparently isn't a word). I want to curl up on my couch with a hot cocoa and watch movies all day. I want to go sledding or cross country skiing (not like I'll get off my fat but and do it, but I want the option). I want to make snow forts and throw snow balls at my husband. Unfortunately, this winter has been devoid of snow. The roads have been fine. There has been no excuse to stay indoors and do nothing (besides the "it's too cold" excuse). 

I'm sorry all you DCers, but I wish I was you right now. Life is boring here in the cold, windy, not snowy Chicago. Unfortunately, this "winter weather" we are having right now isn't even going to give us a foot of snow, so I'm out of luck this year. So, I'll take what I can get right now. Maybe next time.
I knew i liked volunteering at the bird centre but i never realized how much until i started as a full time employee 4 weeks ago. i have never felt more passionate about anything. this really is what i need to do with my life. animal care is my calling. i go in on my days off, i put in unpaid overtime, i go home and cry because i've fallen in love with the sick, it's stressful and overwhelming but there is no where else i'd rather be. i learn new things every hour, and there's still so so much i don't know. i just know i feel as though this is where i belong. now if only i could somehow satisfy that pang in the back of my chest that wants me to wander the planet for months on end...

my social life is mostly on hold. one or two times a week i manage to show my face around town but i mostly work and sleep. my next task is finding more time for my pony. 

i think i'll be going to mtl this sunday evening for A Camp. hope to see some ladies i like
It was perfect weather in Malta. Average of 22 degrees celsius, light breeze, clear skies. Perfect for the half-marathon that we went down for. David's parents and I stopped to take photos and wave him on in support at various stops along the way, which was loads of fun. 

Luckily, we seem to have brought some of that glorious weather back with us!

In other news, I got a job! I'm a little bit nervous about starting so send me some positive vibes, won't you? :)
Just had to blog about today, it's proving to be such a great day. I woke up this morning with a nasty cold, and dragged myself out of bed feeling very sorry for myself. But I am sooo glad I did. I got people to fill in my questionnaires for my dissertation, and the exam results were published. I got results that I am proud of and very happy with, and I'm still in line for my first class honours.
On top of that, I spoke to a friend today, who had heard through the "grapevine" that there may be a really cool opportunity in the department. I don't want to say too much 'cause it's not a sure thing yet, but it's damn good to even be able to consider it.
I'm having such a good year so far, I'm going to Montana in April, I'm busy with a research project with two friends of mine, I'm on the editorial board for the University journal, and now another opportunity is possibly coming my way. All the hard work is starting to pay off and I'm feeling really positive.
I don't mean to brag, and hope that I'm not coming across that way, because the truth is, at times I can't really believe all this is happening to ME. I'm actually just really excited, and grateful for everything that is coming my way.
Now all I have to do is find enough time in the day for everything! ;D
UGH School...

I'm at school right now and it sucks. I hate high school. I mean im not gonna remember high school like others did. Like my mom and dad. Heres why. I'm going to not use the word hate because its a very strong word and yeah. Anyways. I have to say i very DISLIKe my math class because I have like the worst teacher on the whole planet. Shes like this short foreign lady. ( im not a racist im just stating a fact so dont judge me). She has this accent that i Cant really understand. She speaks vietnamese i think. Well anyway she is the most confusing teacher and I can barely understand her. I tryed so hard to focus today. I tryed to listen but then all the stupid classmates are like complaining and yelling !! UGH how do I do this!?!? Anyway so i got this tutor. Hes like really smart and intelligent.  But hes really hard. He goes off what we are learning. Not in bad way but like more in depth math. Which is cool, but hard. Sometimes he gives me problems that he said is fifth grade math and I'm like "This is not easy!!" My cousin wouldnt know how to do this! Its hard because i if i get something wrong hell like do this thing with his hands. He'll like cross his heart and say something i forgot. But its kinda funny but its not good. He a really old fashioned guy. Hes older so thats why he is a math wiz.
     So I'm worried about school because i like have this focus problem and i dont  have will power i always get people to do it for me but if i really cared i would have to do it myself. Right? And im so distracted by the stupid internet and this blog and facebook. Well I'm in art and the bell is gonna ring soon but yeah. Anyways. I dont really like school right now but if I study and try my best to focus I might actually do better.
So I suppose I should consider my rock star lifestyle is catching up with me. I had some sick-ass awesome insomnia in middle and high school (which ultimately lead to amazing creations and major advancement in my art due to lack of better things to do) and it's been back for the past few days or so. I just can't sleep at night, and by the time the sun comes around I'm so awake it's beyond me. I've been catching naps before work, but I'm not sure if that's helping. Maybe it's all the stress.

But what stress? I got my car back the other day, so that's great news. I got a kick ass assistant helping me find a new pad by the end of the month, and I have a nice new addition to my life *(more on that later- I can't disclose who or what it is. Not a baby tho. Cause fuck, we all know I would fuck that up).

Anyway- the point is I can't sleep at night. The only time I'm tired is from 6pm to midnight for some god fucking unreasonable reason that is a complete mystery. Wtf am I suppose to do about it? I tried to take a nap on Friday and I slept through the entire shift on accident.

This is sorta but not unlike those three weeks where I woke up every day at seven fucking am in the morning. No reason didn't matter how much prior sleep, just 7am- eyes open, and always very hungry. I thought about getting some early ass day job to fill the time.

I'm so exhausted staring at this screen at my 26th hour of awakeness. I know that if I shut my eyes I'll just be awake at 12am and the whole shitty process starts over again. Especially because I have to be some fucking where at 4pm.

My brain acts like a wild teen independent of my will.

Oh yea. I almost forgot- I totally found my "sports injury cream" and I'll be rubbing the shit out of my knees with it. Sweet sweet pain relief. They were starting to scare me with the "popping" sounds and discomfort. I can feel safe in the fact this is 2010 though, so robot knee technology is just around the corner.
Yesterday I finally got the result of Toefl ibt. It was really good: 109. I was so nervous before I pressed the button to reach out the score and there were thousands of butterflies in my stomach. But eventually that was it. In an instant I broke down because of the joy actually.

Now I am on the way to my dream. I have finished the first step of preparation of going abroad, which is to take part in English exams and make the best of myself out of it.In some sense, I believe God is blessing me or I should say my grandpa, who passed away all of a sudden five years ago.He is in the heaven and is watching on me all the time.
It perhaps sounds familiar to most of my friends because it was ever classic line in a Korean TV series. I didn't get the opportunity to see the series until recently in my leisure time have access to it on the school net. I was so intensely touched and deeply moved that I couldn't help crying out from time to time.

Then I draw the conclusion from it that one, who is full of love inside his or her heart, is not pathetic at all even if they live lonely in the world without any companions. True love will leave a long-lasting impression to those who engaged in even with the limited and transient time to share with one another.

I am sorry I can' t stay with you in this world, but please remember I love you forever wherever I go.
My lovelies, I didn't mean to stay away from you for so long but as you might have guessed, life took over and work kept me busy these last few days. I thought I would share my big news with you. Do you remember, I told you last summer some people approached me and ask if I could plan their wedding in Andalusia ? Well at that time, I wasn't too sure and declined the offer. But then the idea of being a wedding planner in the region I fell in love with, became really attractive to me, although it can be quite a daunting task. I started another blog Un mariage au soleil (a wedding in the sun) - which some of you already know - while still working on the website. With the precious help of Monchéri, I gathered zillions information about suppliers, religious ceremonies, musicians and what not in our area. Having already worked for wedding planners in Paris as a designer, I knew more or less what the job implied. But I still spent numerous hours on Internet reading blogs of American wedding planners which honestly are the best to me and learning from them. And then, it happened. Before Christmas, I received an email from a French couple saying they want to get married in Granada. We exchanged regular emails and they flew over from Paris last week and we met. My first professional appointment as a wedding planner ! As you can imagine, I was impossibly nervous. I assailed myself with questions : am I wearing the right clothes ? do I know enough, what if I can't answer a question ? and so on...The day before their arrival, I left a little welcome package at their hotel and on d-day I picked up the couple at their hotel and we went for lunch in one of the most typical restaurants in Granada. The days after, we went visiting venues. They were absolutely charming and now with a big smile I can tell you that it went really well (meaning I think they will trust me to be their wedding planner). It is a bit early to say anything yet because the wedding will be in 2011 but it looks definitely promising.

It is surreal to have my mural here in California... and to see it 2.5 years later, after it has been battered by the elements in Eureka Springs, AR. I painted it with outdoor latex house paint so that it would hold up to rain, snow, UV rays, etc... but nature always wins eventually, and it is time for The Divine Mother to get some well-deserved TLC after all She has been through!
While the mural is in good condition, the vibrancy of the colors have faded, and the ancient Egyptian icons I had drawn in with Sharpies had mostly washed away, leaving only their painted silhouettes behind.


I am in the process of restoring the mural to its original vibrancy, and both the owner of the painting and I have big plans for another public showing. I don't want to simply display the mural somewhere, however; I created this mural to be displayed in the context of a themed show about icons involving many other artists. Therefore, I am dreaming of collaborating with other artists to create a new exhibit...
No, I'm not pregnant. I guess this is more Matthew's news that I get to share. He will be finishing his Masters program this year and for these past two years Matthew has had a tough time deciding what to do once he graduates. He has gone through many options like medical school, getting a doctorate in Neuroscience, dental school, and others. He really didn't feel quite right about any of them but knew he needed to make a decision. He sent out several dental school applications recently, however in the meantime found another option that he is really excited about. He found podiatry school. He sent out applications and within a week got 4 interviews. I really feel that this is the route we are suppose to take. I have never seen Matthew more excited about a career choice. He loves that he will be going to Medical School but will come out specialized in the foot and ankle instead of graduating from med school and then having to specialize after that. He also loves that he will be doing office visits and surgeries. Matthew has been interviewing and has been accepted to several places and we have made our decision....We will be moving to Arizona!! Matthew will be attending Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona. We will be moving this summer. I am so proud of Matthew and all that he has done and we are both excited to start this new phase of our life.
Who is your favorite superhero? Lately I have been thinking about superheros. I would have to say that my favorite hero would have to be Superman. This is because he has all of the super powers that anyone one could think of. Yes he does have his flaws. Like the fact that he can't touch or even be around kryptonite, which is slightly ironic because he is from the planet Krypton. No matter what his weakness, he is my favorite fictional superhero. In real life though my hero is my mom. For many reasons she she will always be my number one person. She adopted me when I was twelve years old. Many people wouldn't even adopt a child who is that old. But, she did. She shows me greater love than anyone in the world has. She has her super powers as well. She can make a chicken noodle soup that cures any sickness you can think of, she has a hug that can fix a broken heart, words to make any problem no longer a problem. My mom has had her problems, which gives her so much more experience then I will ever have. Who is your superhero, real or fictional?
Gwen has seen me through my worst; death of a loved one, broken heart, betrayal, you name it, she's been there. She's been one of the most sincere friends. She can tell me when I'm absolutely right, or when I'm absolutely wrong. She knows my mannerisms, she knows my personality in and out, she knows who I am and she still choses to stick around. That in my book, is dedication.

On the flip side, I know Gwen. I know when she's being way too quiet (usually means something is up), or when she's trying to hide something. I know when she's about to cry, I know when her laugh is sincere. I understand the pain she goes through, in one way or another, because her pain is my pain. I find that I want the best for her, even if it means that some day she might not be as easily accessible as she is now.

I guess when it comes down to it, we both have a love and respect for each other. I cant wait to see the old us, sitting around in a kitchen filled with pictures of children and grandchildren, talking about how we were and how we are. I cant wait to know that every part of my life that I have been through, I have shared it with someone who understood me so completely without having to explain anything at all. I cant wait to be an old bum with my best friend Gwen.
Took a trip home this weekend (rather spontaneously and unintentionally) to see friends and family. Somehow going to see someone at 3 in the morning in the town on the island turned into a weekend of absolute insanity! 

It's been a while since my family has been 'normal'. After a tragedy which took place 8 years back, things haven't been easy, but we've plodded along as best we could, and I've always felt that my Mum has been an angel for coping with things the way she has. Unfortunately, times are taking it's tole on her and I've suddenly got a great fear I may be losing her to our lovely friend depression. I've always been at a bit of a loss for what to do with my life, and I've always looked at my mum as a reflection of how when times are hard, you can cope. So seeing her crumble under the slightest pressure is tearing me apart. If there is one thing I am certain of from seeing her this weekend, it's that good people in the world never recieve what they deserve. If there is anyone in the world who deserves a snippet of happiness, it's my Mum. Some of the things that have been said this weekend have made me utterly terrified that I could become the sole carer for my younger brothers; this being something I am not remotely ready for. Every inch of my being prays that my Mum will be able to pull through this. 

Due to this new discovery, I now feel more than ever that it's best I spend the summer home trying to show my Mum and family that life can still be enjoyed. I also need to prove this to myself, as I've started to fall into the defeatist attitude which does nobody any good. Although I'm willing to accept there's a whole world out there, I'm far too willing to allow things to hold me back (such as finances, people etc).. So this summer will be spent pulling myself out of this current rut and enjoying myself... How? I have no idea yet, but I'm sure some ideas will spring to mind! 

 Jog tomorrow morning? Yes. God save me! I know I'll regret this decision at 6.30am in the morning when I drag myself out of bed. But I'll be pleased when I discover my new toned figure in a few months time ;) Many thanks to my housemate for agreeing to do this with me!

Come on Tanya, smile.
i feel like it's all i can think about lately.
I'M SO EXCITED!!!
i feel such a call to go there and serve those who have almost nothing, who don't know the Lord, and who don't feel like there's any hope. i absolutely cannot wait. this excitment is up there with the excitment of going to Pine Cove (maybe a little more, oh my goodness!) i am iinnnn looovvee with the idea of beginning to go on mission trips, but i want to make sure my heart's in the right place. i've been praying and thinkin about it, and i can truly say that i want to go to Africa to help people and spread the word of Jesus Christ. Yes, i am excited about going to another continent, yes i'm excited about saying that i've had that experience, but that is not the main reason i want to go. i want to make a difference in the lives of those people, i want to do my small part in changing the world. i know i won't be recognizable or remembered specifically, but i want to be a part of something that makes my God smile!

Now, i know it's not all fun and games. i have to admit, i'm scared out of my mind. right now, my excitement is sort of masking all of my fears, but i have a feeling that as the date we leave comes closer, i will begin to doubt if i want to do this. but that's my fear talking, and it's time i let all of that go. i will not miss this opportunity! more shots at once then i've ever gotten in my life? if delany can do it, i can do it! malaria medication that COULD cause hallucinations? i'll take my chances and trust in the Lord! my fear of a plance crash, getting kidnapped while there, or starving because of my picky food habits? i'm giving it to God! i need to trust that He'll take care of me. i can do this, with His help...

Anyone reading this, please pray for everyone on the trips safety. pray that we will be able to get over there and do the good works that we were sent there to do, and pray that the Lord will work His magic to relieve our fears and help us help others.
I find that there are very few things in life that can't be remedied by dressing up as your favorite superhero. I have been thinking of getting a =W= tattoo as well. I need to represent the one consistency in my life. She is a proud, strong woman. I envy her, yet want to be her. Since I cannot become a Princess of Themyscira anytime soon, nor do I think that Diana is relinquishing her Lasso of Truth, so for now, I'll make pretend.

I need to get in on the next Comic Con that is around. I just can't wait to be living in the west, where it will be incredibly easy to attend nerdy events like this and hang out with people who get me.

I did try to play D&D in the mall. Hayden wouldn't let me. She ran away embarrassed.

You know what? Boys who play D&D are cute. I stand strongly by that statement.

I've got to download WoW for my Mac now that I have a nice enough OS to be running it. Then I need to transfer chellechanel on over to a new server so I can start taking people down with Titan's Grip. That's my shit.
Its 1:30am and I'm sitting here thinking about my life and how its about to change for the better! In a couple months my baby boy will be here in my arms and as I think of that, things start to race through my mind. How am I gonna raise him to be a gentlemen and treat girls with respect, how am I gonna send him to college, what if something goes wrong? And so many more things are run-in through my mind. I've realized that he is my number one and he his my child and no one is gonna change that. I have to do my best to protect him and give him the best life possible! Camdon, I know he's gonna be a good dad! Burger king fuckked him over bad and he went out the next day and got another job cause of our baby! We both want our baby boy to have the best life and were gonna make it happen! We decided to name the baby karson lowell lee legeman. We have had so many people ask us why karson or why lee lol. We picked karson cause of my dad. My dad has been there for me through thick and thin! Lowell is my grandpas middle name and every day I wish he was here to meet his great grandson! Lee is camdon grandfathers name and we decided to put it in the name because his grandfather has been there when his dad wasn't. I just want everyone to know that we love this baby and karson, mommy and daddy love u and we can't wait for u to come into our lives and make this world a better place! Things are changing and so are camdon and I but its for the better! Karson, we love u baby boy!
After a fantastic three weeks of roadtripping across Texas and into New Mexico with Andrew, we got thrown the biggest curveball yet!
Having decided to set up shop in Austin, I did not expect to get a call back from a company who had originally passed me over for a great job. Here's the time table on this one:
Last week, they call while Andrew is napping in the car in Spring to tell me nix.
I turn to him and say, no need to apply to a Houston school, 'We're moving to Austin!'
April 1 Andrew flies back to London to prepare his apartment, visa, etc. for his August move.
Consequently, April 1 was also the deadline for UH
April 2 The company calls me to tell me they liked me so much they created a new role for me!
Phew. Ugh. Wow. So the money is in Houston. The career building job is in Houston. But Andrew can't go to school in Houston. And building a lif together was the whole point.
A late night (for him) call last night brought a lot of comfort. 'We can handle curve balls. It's what we've been doing all along. And we'll hit this one out of the park, too.'
What a fantastic person I've found!
As I'm writing this, I'll have been in Spain a full year (plus about 3 hours!). March 13th 2009 was a big day. I was hugely excited about my big adventure, but at the same time I was completely terrified. I think I said in my first blog that for someone who had been in the same job for 19 years and 11 months, had never been out of the UK for longer than about 4 weeks, and who generally didn't do anything alone, I appeared to be confronting all those things in one huge hit.

I've been trying to remember what it felt like on my first afternoon here, but it's difficult. Everything here is now so familiar and normal, that casting my mind back to how it was to be new is really hard. I know I remember that everything smelt, sounded and looked, well, just different. That's always the case in a foreign country but usually it's accompanied by a feeling of "Well, it's just a couple of weeks on holiday". But this time, no. This was it. Home. One way or another, I was staying.

I have no intention of rehashing what's happened in the last year - most of it is on this blog anyway.

All I'll say is that I want to thank each and every person who encouraged me, supported me, practically pushed me in some cases, to take the plunge and come here. It's not all been plain sailing, but then staying in the UK probably wouldn't have been either. So thanks to everyone in the UK for wishing me well, keeping in touch and not telling me I'm mad even if you think I am. And thanks to all my friends in Spain for welcoming me, helping me out and making the last year such a memorable one.

Without wishing to sound like an Oscar acceptance speech, I want to mention (in no particular order):
Louise, Andy, Debbie, Cathy, Dade, Sid, Julie, Mum, Hannah, Dad, Eve, Jorge, Nacho, Ann, Pedro (both of them!), Richi, Bev, Kim, Donna, Krizstina, Mariano, Gabriel, Lizzie, Javi, José Luis, Richard, Max, Alex, Nat and Moira. Without you I either wouldn't be here at all, or wouldn't be having as much fun!!!
Time to work on my novel.
I wish I knew where to start.
Character names. I want meaning.
I just hate that it feels so forced.
My body is just as exhausted as my mind. Albeit, work isn't a mentally straining activity, I think that my decision to try to tackle a near 6 miles at the gym today likely had that effect on me.
Chemistry outline. No go. Chemistry homework. Double no go. Chemistry lab. Triple no go.
Novel? Wish I felt inspiration. Someone inspire me.
Yearbook? Absolutely behind. I need to put this at the top of my priority list. My exhaustion and stress is just causing everything to look so bleak. I need to design the cover. Upload things. Inspire people, when inspiration is what I am lacking.
I need a new band to listen to. Suggestions? Share them with me, I'd greatly appreciate it. I feel like there is little inspiration in the world surrounding me currently.
I just want to read Shakespeare. Everything seems better when his words pass my eyes. Something about everything he has to say. I wish he were alive today, I need a man who understands me the way he does. Current obsession: A Midsummer Night's Dream. Something so real about the irony in this play that makes me appreciate our inability to love those we should, and instead, chase that which we cannot possess. It's a sad state of affairs.
I just need inspiration. Let me reiterate that. Someone. Anyone. Inspire me.
I need to be reminded why I love the world, and why I want to spend the rest of my life describing my love for everything around me.
Thank you, and goodnight.
I suppose I should utilize my writing toward a more productive outlet.. more commonly known as, my novel.
Yes i realize that i have already written a blog today but after becoming a blogger so many different topics have played on my mind and i really need to get this one out of my head before it is all that i think about.

Music can change a persons mood, it can fill in as background noise or it can be the reason many people are gathering in the one location but my question tonight is; Is music really so influential on peoples lives?

I ask this because i just finished watching a DVD or pinks latest tour. now its no secret that i am a die hard pink fan, but her music has helped me through some very hard times in my life. For as long as i can remember i have listened to her music and learnt all of her songs word for word trying to learn hat they are about and their meanings. Now I'm not saying every one else is a die hard fan of hers but every person has at least one band that they love unconditionally, my partners for example is Korn.

The thought that has continued to run through my mind all day is "does music influence others the way it does me?" I'd really like to know, because i know in my life every time i look back on a hard part, a good part, the times that always make me cry and the times that always make me laugh, the on common denominator is music, different types for different moods or occasions but still music.

let me know if music influences your life or if u turn to music when you are having a hard time, id really like to hear your opinions.
woke up in a bit of a grumpy mood this morning. I think because I had an absolute craptastic nights sleep due to excessive worrying and stressing over a friend in trouble at the moment, money issues, an ex that’s upset me and various other things that seem to nag and niggle at my brain when I lye down to try and sleep. It’s frustrating how at the very time you want to be relaxing, all these things start running around in your head and causing chaos. I think if anyone could actually read my thoughts they would get exhausted just listening in, I know I do. 

Isn’t it bizarre how you can be lying there doing absolutely nothing however the over thinking and analyzing leaves you feeling utterly exhausted. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier if I’m honest with myself, because I tend to care way too much about everyone and everything that is going on. Most of the time though it doesn’t effect my sleep because I make myself daydream about wonderful things which then blocks out the stress and lulls me to sleep. Lately that hasn’t been working and I’m kind of at a loss of what to do.  Last night I read for three hours straight until I finally drifted off to sleep.  If anyone has some ideas on how to help do let me know.

But anyways, on a happier note I’m really enjoying blogging. According to myspace my blog has had 70 views this week. That’s kind of cool. Pity there hasn’t been much of the way of comments because I would really love to get feed back from who ever is reading it, and from fellow lovers of all things creative. But then again I’m doing this for me, not for anyone else so either way I’m happy, it’s just a lot of fun.
Life, ok, has its ups and downs. But can be truly amazing. Im sat in my room drinking good ole Sprite, and munching on galaxy cookie (: nom nom. But yehh, recently i haven't been feeling my usual happy self. The other night i sorta had a "breakdown" as such. And the people that helped me through it, were the people i would atleast expect. They helped me alot. They made me see the light again. Cus tbh they were right, I have the most amazing friends ever, ok they're will always be some people to put me down, most times, its for no good reason. Only to make themselves feel better, carry on, cus you ain't bringing me down. I know if i am ever down, my friends, are always there to pick me back up. I have a good bunch. My family, are my rocks tbqh. They are defo there for me through thick and thin (: Life can be cruel at times, and theres always something to make you feel like shit, but you gota remember, your never alone. They're are people out there who have no-one to turn to. So i guess im saying, im glad i do. I wouldn't be anything without you guys. I owe you everything. I love you.
"Grass, ah grass." This is but one of the many musings my husband has uttered in his sleep over the years. He has also fought great armies, urging me alongside, and sold God knows how many home improvement supplies. (He works for a home improvement company.) It has been very amusing to listen to him and even try to get him to converse (successfully sometimes)! Sometimes he simply mumbles, and I can't understand a thing!

Well, I don't really know the inception of sleep-talking, but as an educated guess I would say there must be something genetic about it, because in the last couple of months, little girl has been sleep-talking too! Her vocabulary is limited in comparison and she only speaks 1-2 word sentences awake (though she does say over 60 words), so her sleep-talking has been limited to one word per instance. The first time she called out one of our dogs, "Lola!" I checked on her, and was surprised that she was sound asleep. The second was, "Dad!" and then just last night "Close!" First of all, it tickles me that she calls these words out, like she is shouting them to someone. Then the choice of words is interesting. I wonder what she is dreaming about in that little head of hers. . . .
Here's the idea.  The first person asks a question beginning with "Would you rather..."  The next poster answers the question, and then asks a new question with response..

I'll start the ball rolling, I have some awesome ones .... but ill start simple.. ;) ( oh btw all questions are fine just dont get sexual pLLEEASEEE((If you do I am not responsible nor will I respond:)) :) Thanks! Make them thought provoking .. ;)

Would you rather go without food for a week or without shelter for a week?
It was a really wonderful day!!  I slept in until 9am - unheard of for me, but woke feeling well rested.  The kids slept in later, so I had the house to myself this morning :-))  Tea and quiet - so peaceful!  

I was out until 11:30 last night with my girlfriends.  We are planning a weekend away in June for the 55th birthday of my good friend Susan #1.  Susan #2 has a family cabin/house on Big Lagoon in California - so we are going to take a road trip down there and spend 3 days of just "girls" - there will be five of us and it will be so much fun!

Today was a basketball game for the youngest - they won, which was very nice!!  Then the kids went to dad's for the day and I hung out with my buddy Angela.  We went to Walmart for a sewing machine (which they no longer carry), then on to Michael's, then Ikea.  I got all the things I wanted (except the cheap sewing machine).  Then we walked down the block from my house to this little Italian restaurant for dinner.  All in all, a good day - very relaxing!

On the art front not much happened today - I was too busy socializing.  But I did want to show you this sweet little china box made in Occupied Japan, that I found weeks ago.  I just discovered it's a perfect fit for my 52 List for 2010 cards.  Check it out...
Tomorrow I will be staying home all day and playing with my art supplies, so I hope to have something to show you Sunday evening...


all for tonight my lovelies - sweet dreams,


and to all my friends in the Pacific - stay safe - I am thinking of you tonight!!!
But this is no philosophy essay. After second year's 20th Century French Thought, I vowed never to delve into the subject in great depth ever again. However, I can say from experience that languages encapsulate humanity. The death of a language marks the death of an entire way of thinking, of self-justification, self-understanding and identity. Hector Kollias of King's French Department could do a much better job of explaining it than I ever could. You want more, email him.

I have to spend my day speaking and understanding German and it is then that the true strength of a language to shape its speakers really comes into play. In English, you can beat about the bush. "Erm... excuse me, sorry, I was wondering... you wouldn't mind awfully if I happened to take this seat, would you?". It's a language of apology, indirectness and implications. German? No such luck. These structures simply don't work. If you want the chair, you bloody well ask if you can take the chair. No bones about it. You say what you mean and nothing else. Yes, of course they have their idiomatic phrases - have you had a nose full of someone recently? If you have an exam, do you press your thumbs for luck?
I still miss my father. I do not remember when it was he officially left me. There is a picture in a photo album of my oldest brother, our father, and myself. We were at a park or zoo; I was at most 4. I had two braids in my hair, with pink ribbons, that matched the pink teddy bear I was holding. I was gazing past the camera with a sad/angry/angsty look on my face. My brother was eating popcorn and gazing left and not looking too happy. Our father was gazing right; he did not look happy either. Was it just a bad day the three of us were having? Probably the four of us because I assume it was our mother taking the picture. It was a picture of our family, but not of a family. Even then we were all painfully unhappy.
I can't come up with a cohesive theme for this blog entry, but I'm blogging anyway.

The girls all did a homeschool gymnastics class today and they all liked it enough that they want to do it again. At $5 per kid, per class, I'm happy with that. It was the first time we've been to a "real" gymnastics place, as opposed to a gymnastics class put on by a community center. Irina had a blast, especially. She had a bit of trouble figuring a few things out, but overall she did fine. 

Tomorrow we have our weekly park day with the Life Learners and I have one kid who isn't so keen on going because, as an introvert, more than one activity per week (plus a lot of errands over the weekend) feels like too much for her. As it is, most park days she's the one who is asking if we can just go already, while the other two are always upset to leave. I'm trying to figure out how to balance the needs of all of my children, but it seems to be my eternal quest. I just can't figure out how to make everyone happy. The compromise this time is to go to park day, but after lunch and only for a couple of hours. It would help my introvert immensely if she had a good friend who was always willing to play one-on-one with her and who was there consistently. She's had two in the past, but both have moved away.
So I went shopping today for my diet food, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge selection of food that are not only low in calories and carbs, but that also actually taste good! I loaded up on plenty of fruit and the fruit bars that Special-K makes....They are super good! Between eating right (the biggest problem is cutting out all the Coke I drink!) and doing my two miles a day on the treadmill, I should be bikini/tattoo ready for Orlando! I'm one of those lucky woman that not only had seven kids who were all very large at birth, but I don't have one stretch mark on me....So I get the tummy flat and I'll look good in that two piece this June:)

Mark is dieting with me, so it's making it so much easier. We ate salads for dinner last night, but tonight I think I'll try us out on some fresh fish and veggies, along with some Skinny Cow ice-cream treats for dessert. I think we can handle that:)

OKay people, meet me back here in June and I'll show off my new body! I'm excited! I think this is going to be a great Summer.

Feast or Famine
 
I know it's been famine for a while on this blog, so I'm going to take today to give you a feast...divided into courses for those of you who don't have much time. Then you can pick and choose what you'd like to 'eat."

This course- soup, light and easy.


In the last 3 weeks, the weather in Macau has dropped from 30 C to around 8-15 C (the coldest Macau gets). Basically, it's gone from 80+ with 90* humidity to around 40* with a windchill that makes it feel 30*ish. I've actually seen my breath a few times. I hadn't really planned on winter based on past experience for about one more month. Thankfully, since I didn't have time to go and buy a comforter, I remembered that I had brought my sleeping bag with me. It looks really swank on my bed. I did buy one absolute necessity: a cloth cover for my toilet seat. (Remember, there's no indoor heating in Macau). So, my house is also about 30* ish with windchillllllllll. (Sorry, that's the chattering).

Today I woke up with the sound of the Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix in my ears. It goes by the park next to my house. Made me wish that Jim and Linda were here.

Save room for meat!
listening to kidd kradick in the morning today (kiddlive.com) i heard them discussing that today is the day that you are able to begin "pre-ordering" apples new product, the ipad!....yay.... i am not sure on how to feel about this new product. of course many people love it (though they havent tried it) and have to buy it (though the ridiculous price) but...there are some major downfalls to it i feel:
1) you can't multitask! i don't know about yall, but when i'm on my computer i have my internet up (with multiple tabs of course!) my media player playing music, sometimes microsoft word up, along with photoshop and many other programs. but not uh, no sir, this ipad is going to help keep you focused on one thing, because well, it's only capable of letting you do one thing.
2) no cd drive. or any other drive at that. basically its a touch screen version of the mac book air....without the function-ability of the air. and it weighs more. yay.
3) well im still working on the rest of my complaints which i will update you on later but for now i'll leave it at the name. the ipad. next thing you know theyre going to have the itampon.
We are leaving bright and early tomorrow morning to visit Aaron's mom for a week. It's going to be super cold, so we were trying to pack appropriately when we both looked at each other and said, "We don't really have any cold weather clothes!" That's what living in a mild climate year round will get you. Ah well, I'm sure we'll be good. Lots of layers, right?

My other concern is of course little girl. I have actually flown with her several times and she's been great, but those were all at 1 yr or less of age, so she was much less mobile and nursing put her right to sleep. I'm not so sure how good she will do now. At least it is a fairly short flight, and Daddy is going too.

Man, they're terrible. And she's not even two yet! But I know most of this is my fault. I give in to her much too often, and now I am suffering the consequences. It's really hard to hold fast when you know you might be in for a 10, 15 minute tantrum and even those only end when you give in and say, "Okay, come here. I can see you need help settling down. Do you want some milk?" She never, I mean never, comes out of a tantrum on her own. At what point is it cruel to be ignoring her?

In any case, if you were wondering what set her off today, 1) Wanting to open the tums she saw when I grabbed a towel from the closet. 2) Wanting to walk in the kitchen where there were broken bits of a bowl I was cleaning up. 3) The dog took his toy that she had grabbed from him. It really is just the small stuff. How can I help my little girl release her frustrations more calmly?? Or is that even possible?
