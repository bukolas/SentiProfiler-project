If you know me pretty well, you'll know that doing this was stepping pretty far outside of my comfort zone. But I told myself that when we moved, I wanted to have more people over. At the old house, we almost never did. Partly due to our antisocial leanings, but also because of the house itself. It just made me feel self-conscious to have people in it unless I was very comfortable with them.

So, it was good and I'm glad we did it. I'm happy that we were part of making something cool and wild and crazy happen for Zeb as one of his final memories of the Life Learners. I also offered to take one of the kids to the park the next day with us, as his mom is not in town right now, and I discovered how well he gets along with all my kids, so I think perhaps more play-dates could be in our future. So that was a very good thing.

I had been thinking and worrying a lot lately that there was not enough social interaction in my girls' lives. Having this sleepover has helped me to see that maybe I'm just not doing enough to invite opportunities into our lives. But it hasn't been just this; new friends just seem to pop up when I'm open to it. I was worrying about the lack of girls around my girls' ages and then, all of a sudden, there were some. And then I realized that maybe they don't need girl friends quite as much as I thought they did. They all three of them had such a fun time with the boy who stayed after everyone else was gone.
