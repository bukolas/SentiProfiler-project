he disney wonder was a great ship. The food was excellent. The shows were of Broadway caliber.There was plenty of activities to keep you busy including bingo. I won this trip which made it even better. We saw Nassau and Castaway Cay disneys island. I went on the glass bottom boat excursion. I lost my cap but it was retrieved for me.
