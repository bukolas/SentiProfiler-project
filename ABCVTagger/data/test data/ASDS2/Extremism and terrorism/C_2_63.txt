Too much of it here and its disgusting how muslims go around making tafkir on huge groups without the knowledge, they stoop so low to look for the slightest fault in a muslim to go around label and insult them. The worst I've seen so far is a user labelling all the scholars and imams and all the muslims following them kuffar, because they were simply trying to get muslims to vote against the BNP, which was absolutely disgusting and nothing was done about it. And it seems other members enjoy these posts as they absolutely nothing to defend those muslims accused of such an act. Anway I think there should be guidlines set on the conditions of kufr, because people here are abusing it and risking major sin by making tafkir whenever they get the chance.
