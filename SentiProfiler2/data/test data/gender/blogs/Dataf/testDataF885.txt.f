I visited my bestbestbestest friends at Kibbutz Hazorea this weekend. Most of my girlfriends (have to emphasize the girl part) embarked on a program after high school called Garin Tzabar. In this program, they were able to make Aliyah on their own with a community of same-aged peers who want to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. The program provides them housing, adopted families, and certain privileges that regular Israeli soldiers wouldn't be able to obtain. 
All of this is possible when residing on a kibbutz. A kibbutz, in the old days, used to be a socialist community where families live together, work in the same field (i.e farming, agriculture), and would get back the same necessities as everyone such as housing and food.
Things have changed since those days, although a lot of main kibbutz characteristics have remained. The cows, the chicken, the food production, and the main community dining room have remained. It was really nice having dinner and breakfast with the entire community of babies, children, working adults, and elderly that all live in this town-like place which serves the same foods.
