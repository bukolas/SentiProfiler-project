I have to say that I really did love this bike, I owned one from 2002 to 2005!  Easy to handle and comfortable, with enough power to get me up the grades to Mammoth!People thought I was riding a harley, lol.. I was so grateful that  paid a fraction of what it would have cost me for a harley.Great gas mileage, I rode it everywhere! with the weather in Ca. and this bike. Oh My, I was in heaven!
