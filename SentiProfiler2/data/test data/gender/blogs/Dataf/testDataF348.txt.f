I have so many interesting ideas for the blog, but I really have so little time. I have family commitments and I work full time. Every night immediately after the little one goes to bed, I run straight to my laptop to work on the daily post, look over the comments, and then check out twitter. Lastly I check my email, which in amount can vary widely. This entire process takes at least an hour and if I want to do more than one blog post, I'm on the computer for close to two hours. There are many nights that I turn off my computer, head directly into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and go straight to bed. But I bring home work that I have to do two to three nights per week. It's either a very late night for me or I skimp on the post. Normally I choose to stay up late! The state of our house? Wrecked! I leave everything until the weekend. My husband is picking up the slack (and doing stuff for the blog on the side to help me out), but it's quite taxing on the household. Most nights the dishes do not get done. The reason I'm sharing this is that I want you to know that I really want to interact with you, my readers, more. I want to comment on your comments, but I just don't have the time. I want to respond to all of your emails, but I get the chance. Please forgive me. Time is my enemy.
