Why is the Home Secretary so insistent that the Metropolitan Police should always investigate itself? Are there not policemen outside London who could produce reports that would have greater credibility than any report produced by an officer of the Metropolitan Police, which in many ways takes on the characteristics of a sort of masonic mafia that wants to protect its own? Would not this report have been more credible if it had been produced by someone outside the Metropolitan Police?
I do not accept that. It is a matter of opinion. I believe that some of the problems of policing the metropolis are very different from those in rural counties, and I should have thought that that was abundantly clear to many people. I hope that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price), who is normally very fair, will read the memorandum set out by Mr. Dear in his report, all the information in the Library, and my statement. When he has done so, I think he will see that criticisms of Mr. Dear of the sort that he made about there being a masonic attitude to this report are grossly unfair to a distinguished and extremely good officer.
Will my right hon. Friend take note of the fact that, although no Conservative Member would want to associate himself with any of the vindictive police bashing that we sometimes hear from Opposition Members, some of us feel that an element of independence in the police complaints procedure would be no bad thing?
