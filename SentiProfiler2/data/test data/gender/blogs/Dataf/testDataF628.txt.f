A few weeks ago Bonnie, the more exciteable of the two puppies, charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose. It bloody hurt. Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose. However, me being me, I thought, "it can't possibly be Bonnie's fault" and so I decided I had sinusitis! Stop laughing at the back .&nbsp; Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had. Except today I couldn't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor. So off I trudged, to his little TARDIS in the next village, and let him have a right good look up my hooter. Prodding and pressing, feeling and caressing, asking me about snot and things on my hankie, he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine. "Have you knocked it recently?" he asked. "Oh, well one of my puppies did a bit since," I answered.&nbsp; Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis. "You've broken your nose," he said. He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense. It's slightly swollen but is now on the mend and apparently re-setting itself. And it still bloody hurts! And moving swiftly on, Amy drew out five names from her "see you, Jimmy" hat.&nbsp; I will contact each one of you and ask for your address so that I can send a copy of my childrens book to you.&nbsp; Here is the Vlog we did which shows Amy drawing the names from the hat.&nbsp; If you didn't win a copy but would like to receive one, you can always buy one here .&nbsp; Thank you for all your comments and for taking part in my little competition. What do you say to them when you realise that whatever you do say might not be understood.&nbsp; Or will be, more times than not, a waste of time, and will make you feel worse than you probably do already.&nbsp; Those beautiful malteser eyes stare up at me with huge great tears just bursting with volcanic resemblence, and I am supposed to decide in a split second whether this is an age issue, or one of autistic trait. Last week I lost the plot.&nbsp; I guess sometimes even mums are allowed to have a tantrum, and that was what I did.&nbsp; The door took most of it, but I must have looked like a mad woman; completely crazed by a child's rudeness.&nbsp; I couldn't cry.&nbsp; Tears wouldn't come to the surface even though I was sobbing inside.&nbsp; I knew having a tantrum in front of my autistic daughter was the worst thing I could have done, and I'm still reliving it seven days later, when she tells me how crazy I was.&nbsp; But then the inevitable happened; word from elsewhere that Amy had been telling her friends about our little tete-a-tete.&nbsp; I was wrong to do what I did, I'm usually calm and walk away from a situation where I know I cannot win, but just occasionally, that little wire snaps, and bingo.&nbsp; I'm a gonna. Of course things calmed down within the hour but I spent a few days beating myself up, thinking of new ways to tackle the issues which no doubt surround adolescence.&nbsp; But what's not easy to get a handle on is adolescence vs autism.&nbsp; As yet I do not know exactly what the next twelve months will bring, let alone the next five years of which I am sure will be just as hard for Amy as it will for me.&nbsp; The school are helping, as is the school nurse, but right now, support is very thin on the ground.&nbsp; And that, I am sorry to say, is nothing new. p.s. Book giveaway draw will take place either tomorrow or Wednesday; am trying to persuade reluctant child to help with filming it! Something amazing happened yesterday.&nbsp; I knew at the beginning of the week that I was nearing the end of my novel, the one I have been writing on and off for the past two years.&nbsp; The one in which I have fictionalised my own paranormal experiences, seeing them through Camilla's eyes.&nbsp; I have lived her life, thought her thoughts, created her from my own imagination.&nbsp; I have felt as if I owned her, as if she answered only to me.&nbsp; I have visualised actors playing the parts of characters, Martin Shaw as the Reverand Oakley, Robson Green as Michael all verging on a complete fantasy of which I have seen played out before my eyes. But yesterday I realised that I had reached the light which marked the end of my work in progress.&nbsp; I had said everything that needed to be said, got to the point where stretching out the novel for the sake of length would have been wrong and most likely spoilt the whole effect.&nbsp; And so I closed the file and finished it.&nbsp; I haven't typed the words, "The End" because I am sure there will be much to add, and too much to subtract.&nbsp; I have put my little memory sticks on which the book is saved, into a drawer and locked it.&nbsp; After the lambing I will open that drawer and begin the editing process which I know will be hard, but will mean another step nearer to presenting it for potential publication.&nbsp; I suspect finding a publisher will be the most difficult part, but for now I shall enjoy achieving my goal of writing my paranormal novel. And so, in order to celebrate this achievement, I am giving away three copies of a children's book which I wrote myself and self-published.&nbsp; The book, Adventures at Aaron Loch Farm, is a compilation of children's stories which I wrote a few years ago.&nbsp; It's nothing fancy, but all my own work, including the book cover picture.&nbsp; But I'm proud of it, because it was the first book I had published, albeit by myself.&nbsp; I shall write all commenters names on a separate piece of paper then ask Amy to draw out three at random.&nbsp; I'm more than happy to post anywhere in the world.&nbsp; And if I get lots of comments I shall increase this giveaway to five copies, but if you would rather not receive a copy and you still want to leave a comment, just say, I won't in the least bit be offended.&nbsp; You know me, I love my comments.&nbsp; CJ xx We had one of those unforgettable family afternoons on Sunday.&nbsp; The sky was blue, few clouds scattered in recognisable shapes, a distant micro-glider buzzing above the barley fields.&nbsp; The Farmer was sawing down hedges, keeping himself busy in the Spring sun whilst Amy and I played hide and seek, her idea; mine was to sit down and play a board game.&nbsp; One of Amy's hiding places was behind the greenhouse, made of glass. I had no problem finding her on that occasion. We decided to join the Farmer in the end, walking down the field to be greeted by 4 excited collies, bounding towards us.&nbsp; I couldn't miss the opportunity of taking the camera and the camcorder, so here's a little vlog snippet for you, it's only a minute in length, without my ugly mug, so quite safe to watch. A long time ago, when I lived in the South East, I did some contract work for the Crown Prosecution Service; a very interesting job but one I couldn't have undertaken as a permanent post.&nbsp; I saw many harrowing files, witnessed cases being brought to court, and even sat in on a murder trial to assist one of the law clerks.&nbsp; It was pressure all the way, and even though I was young, married to my first husband with no children, I just wasn't cut out for the responsibility in which the job demanded.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I made few friends and was quite relieved once my contract came to an end, lucky enough to find a permanent job not long after at Rothmans where I did make friends and felt much more at ease.&nbsp; But even though my temporary post at the CPS didn't work out, I have always been interested in law; attending college to get the Institute of Export qualification thus making my job at Rothmans more successful. Now I find myself asking a question; as a defence lawyer, knowing your client is guilty, with strong evidence to prove it, how would you defend them?&nbsp; You have a murderer or the like standing in the witness box, having just sworn on the bible, and refusing to accept responsibility for their actions, yet the lawyer knows otherwise.&nbsp; Does the lawyer get his client off and risk that person being back on the streets to murder again?&nbsp; What is classed as winning a case so far as the defence team are concerned?&nbsp; When I was a little girl I used to love visiting my grandma.&nbsp; She lived in a 3 bedroom 1930's semi on the outskirts of a small town.&nbsp; The house also had a large back garden, seeming much bigger when I was a child.&nbsp; We always used the back door which opened into a little porch, or lean-to as is sometimes known, which went straight into a small kitchen.&nbsp; I remember the units being similar to the ones we used to have in the farm house kitchen before it was renovated.&nbsp; Two doors in the kitchen, one leading into the back room which was used most of the time and the other going into the front room, a large sitting room with a sideboard, gramophone and a few other pieces of furniture of which I can't quite recall.&nbsp; I do remember however, the photographs of which grandma had on display, sitting proudly in their frames on the sideboard. I used to love this room; I would spend most of our visits playing on my own with the brass ornaments grandma had on the fireplace.&nbsp; I often got told not to touch but you know what kids are like.&nbsp; But I was always so proud of the baby photo; I used to stare at it and ask my mum to tell me what I was like as a baby. The reason why I look so chubby was because my parents left me with my auntie for two weeks not long before it was taken.&nbsp; My dad had to go to Germany on business and mum decided to go with him, taking my almost 4 year old brother with them.&nbsp; When they returned they were shocked to see me as I lay in my pram, the only explanation being my auntie had fed me on bananas for the whole duration. Having been passsed the baton by Trish of Mum's Gone To , I now proudly present it to my taggee who can be found here .&nbsp; This is a picture of the person in question, a little clue for you on the photograph. No matter how many times we wish we had the better option, we are always able to make do with what we have.&nbsp; I have learnt over the years that the challenges and obstacles of which I have been faced with have not been bestowed on me because I couldn't cope.&nbsp; We go through many testing times throughout our existence, some of us are faced with more than others, but these are only times which we can deal with, only tests in which we will, eventually, pass. We need people in our lives to help us cope with the days that we wish our parallel universe was a little nearer to reality.&nbsp; It isn't easy sailing through life having nothing to worry about, and that is something most of us will never experience.&nbsp; I worry if I haven't got something to worry about.&nbsp; The responsibilities we take on during the course of our lives are often so great that it isn't uncommon for one to feel we are in it way over our heads, incapable of getting through a day. Life is a precious gift; imagine how incredible it would be if there were two of us.&nbsp; A parallel existence in another universe could be all the things we always wanted to be, it could do everything we planned to do, visit all the places we want to see, have the perfect job, live in a perfect house.&nbsp; Even though this wouldn't be reality, what would you want for your life in a parallel world?&nbsp; Putting aside your contentment in this life, imagining you could choose another You. I had Amy's statement( of special education needs ) review recently. The first one at her new school. I came away with a spring in my step, totally in awe at the incredibly keen interest of which the school have taken towards her welfare. They can't do enough for her, ensuring she gets the maximum enjoyment and educational support she possibly can. I had my report to submit, along with reports from the school and her communications officer. And what I found comforting was the fact that we are all on the same wavelength. Nodding heads and lots of "yes, absolutely"'s and I felt good inside. Amy's growing up, and the school are acknowledging that head on. As you know, she has started doing life skills which comprise of swimming, helping at another school, cookery and soon to be helping at a library and possibly a nursery. The nursery arrangement concerned me a little due to Amy's difficulties in dealing with younger children ( she gets very aggressive towards them ) but the school once more came up trumps and ensured me she would be observed and supervised at all times. The current statement stipulates 26 hours support per week, but the authorities were suggesting that this be reduced to 20 hours as from 1st April. The school are in total disagreement with this plan and are insisting that 26 hours remains, if not to be increased. I was almost jumping up and down with thanks. It's so important that Amy doesn't lose any hours because, as the school agreed, the reason why she has been doing so well at middle school is because she has a good level of support. But it's all about funding. People don't matter anymore; and that's what we need to change.
