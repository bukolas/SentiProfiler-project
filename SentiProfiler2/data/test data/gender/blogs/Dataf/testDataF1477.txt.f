A question for God looms in my mind like water rolling and spinning; chortling into an abyss of time. When I was nineteen I was dying so that I could live. I survived this challenge to come through this lifetime with the knowledge that God is within.


I was a college student, home for the summer and had gone to a party. At that party there was drinking and pot smoking. A good friend’s boy friend had come on to me and I was tempted to flirt back. In fact, I did flirt back. I was young. I was beautiful and I was an atheist. 


A year earlier my longest childhood friend had a swimming pool accident which left her a paraplegic. My friend, the athlete was changed forever and I felt guilty. It was the unreasonable kind of guilt that summons over the young just because it can and it did. My friend was changed and I too changed. I grew angry, and in a way I became uncaring about life itself.


I learned years later that often when we have profound thoughts they can manifest into reality. My thoughts at that time were, “Why didn’t it happen to me?”


That night of drunken partying with a cute boy who was supposedly attached to a good friend I got into my car to drive home and through no fault of my own was hit. Suddenly my car flew out of control spinning around and around in the darkened summer night. I sat in the driver’s seat with voices going through my mind of my father and my brother, “Don’t do this....Do that!” Paralyzed I began to pray, “Dear God! I don’t know what to do! Help me!” In that moment I gave up my arrogance and went into complete surrender and when I did that an extreme and blinding white shield of light came directly out of my chest surrounding me like an egg shell.


The car continued to spin and finally slammed into an apartment building narrowly missing a telephone pole. I jumped out of the car mainly to see if I could still walk. My car was totaled, but I was okay. 


The man who had hit me had been “joy racing” with another driver going over 90 miles per hour and I had inadvertently gotten into his way.
