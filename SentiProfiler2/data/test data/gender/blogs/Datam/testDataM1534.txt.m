The next optimization technique, I will be demonstrating is a predicate pushing problem.  Unbeknownst to most developers, SQL Server 2005 does have a problem with predicate pushing in views.  A lot of these issues have been resolved in SQL Server 2008, but should be known.  I will be demonstrating a very simple example, using a ranking function.  Ranking functions are relatively new to SQL Server and were introduced in 2005.  I am sure there are other scenarios that cause predicate pushing problems, but I will only be addressing the ranking problem, in this post.s
