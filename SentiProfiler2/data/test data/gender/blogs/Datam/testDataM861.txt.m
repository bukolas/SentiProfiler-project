Saint Patrick's Day! I totally forgot. That is really sad since I am 50% Irish and almost 50% Scottish. I have no cultural identity. I am just a lost soul who has no culture. I think maybe the one thing that I inherited from my Irish forefathers is anger problems, but that is a different story. I didn't wear any green, I didn't do anything to celebrate. I am surprised I even thought of it at all. I guess its because my Mom cooked a Corned Beef and it smelled so Damn good. The green tablecloth also helped. Otherwise I would have probably gone throughout the entire day without even having a clue.
