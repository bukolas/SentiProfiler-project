Its not particularly hard to lose a messaging war against Republicans. I mean, you aren't working against the kind of sophisticated public relations machine typically reserved for say, a Kardashian. You're not even handling a hot potato. If it weren't for the lucky strike of stumbling into a minority by nominating a candidate who, up close, appeared to be melting, Republicans wouldn't even be able to consider their drumbeat of "NO!" much of a message at all. Putting aside the deep irony - Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman both filed amicus briefs when Ralph Nader challenged the Constitutionality of the so-called "Slaughter Rule" - Democratic leaders immediately fell prey to the only response "deem"-ing a bill passed can possibly elicit.

No. Seriously. WTF (followed, as usual, by "Tea Party," but that's another story for another day).

Don't get me wrong. I'd be happy to adopt a "deem" and "pass" approach to almost anything. Louboutains too expensive? I deem them passed into my closet. Parking too tough? I deem and pass my double parking into legitimacy. Deeming and passing a flurry of ideas would not only ensure that the world bows to my dominion, but would, frankly, make Congress more effective. But call me skeptical that an $800+ billion spending bill should be deemed to have passed just like that. Beyond feeling powerless in the whole matter, I feel like I should have the right to know if my Congressman decided, for example, to have his vote purchased with earmark spending or a lobbyist-sponsored "fact-finding" trip to the Caymans.

Not to mention, the current bill happens to be unpopular. Which presents a problem. The real solution would be to go back to the drawing board and draft a bill we can all live with, but that involves work - which people get themselves elected to Congress to avoid - and if they spend more than one more week addressing health care as opposed to, say, dramatic job losses, Congress will see its approval rating sink even lower...perhaps to the level of their Kardashian rivals.

So faced with a decision - significant work or pass an unpopular bill through a back door method that people don't quite understand - Democrats chose the latter.
