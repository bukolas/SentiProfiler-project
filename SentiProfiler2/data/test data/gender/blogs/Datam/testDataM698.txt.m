Hard-Working, Humble, Passionate person who Loves food and is willing to do anything to learn! Gchef703 @ linecook you should not Be a Pre Madonna!!! Should not be late, ask for days off, breaks or a special jacket to show off to your friends Gchef703 @ linecook you should Be a Sponge Listen! Learn! and ask a million questions even if they are stupid questions. ask em! You're about to explode.  There's too far too much blood and oxygen coursing through your veins, and your eyes your pupils are so dialated that they would catch the attention of any police officer you came across.  You just finished your stage, and it went so beautifully that you're too wound up to eat, or drink, or even talk about it.  This is one of those perfectly fleeting moments, so you just sit there on the bus, missing your stop, so you can soak it all up.  You start Tuesday as the new fish cook.  Unless: You blew it.  It seemed like your stage was going ok, but right around the end of the first turn the sous told you that you could take off.  You considered protesting, but instead you decided to change, have a smoke and get a bite to eat.  Sitting down at the bar, you order your food and a drink, and sometime later the chef tells you that you're welcome back anytime...but no job is discussed.  And you dont ask about one.  Your stage is over, and you wasted it.  So how did this happen? Prep: You went into the restaurant between lunch and dinner service dressed appropriately, resume and knives in hand.  For a week you've been reading the menu on-line, and bringing yourself up to speed on the background of the chef and the restaurant itself.  After your chat with the chef, you let him know that you're ready to stage that evening if he would like.  He tells you to come back Friday instead.  On Friday you show up early, smiling and introducing yourself to any staff that you come across.  You take your knives and a spoon out of your kit that you slimmed down a bit, and settle in with any prep work that they'll give you--herb picking, cutting bread, citrus supremes.  You work quietly and cleanly, with eyes and ears open so you dont miss a thing.  Unless: You drop into the restaurant as you walk by, and approach the chef who is expediting a fairly busy lunch service.  He doesn't have time to talk to you right now, but tells you to come back that evening at 4 for a stage.  You tell him that you have tickets to a show, but could you come in tomorrow?  He asks for a resume.  You dont have it with you.  When you do show up for your stage, the chef asks you why you want to work in his restaurant; what is it about this place, this food, that turns you on?  You stumble through some bullshit answers.  He smirks at you.  Unpacking your kit you pull out 6 knives, a spatula, tongs, and a handful of spoons.  The sous steps in next to you. "Um.  What's all that shit for?" Working through your prep, you dont shut up--about your last job, your opinions on how things should be done, and who you think should win top chef.  No one really responds to you, but you go on anyways.  Service: The chef had told you that he needed a fish cook, so this is the station that you stick with through prep, line-up, and into service.  During line up you politely ask if you can taste mise, and as you taste dishes you take notes, and try to memorize the station set-up.  Just before service you sweep the station and wipe down everything for the cook.  You ask the chef if he wants you anywhere else during service, but he says no.  During service you pull plates, and garnish, but generally try to stay out of the way and observe.  Eventually the pace starts to build a bit, and the cook catches your eye. "Alright.  We're going on 7 fish and 6 scallops.  We'll go together, ok?  You take the scallop dish." An hour later you're cooking all of the proteins on your own, with the fish cook plating and garnishing for you.  When the sous asks how it's all going for you, you tell him you love it, and want to close the station that night.  There will be no end of shift meal or drink for you.  Just a cold family meal, a watery iced tea, and a nod of approval from the brigade.  Unless: You bounce around the kitchen getting all up in everyones shit, but not really absorbing anything.  You taste without asking, and more than once you criticize the food.  During one of your rants about how you used to do it at your last job, the grill cook catches looks at you and growls "Well that's so fucking interesting."  Most of your evening is spent leaning against the ice machine, and when you do step in, you're so fucking slow wiping plates and garnishing that the sous knocks the chervil out of your hand and shouts "JUST FUCKING SEND IT!"  You cook zero orders, and when you sit down to eat at the bar, you order an expensive cocktail, and dont tip.  You.  Fucking.  Blew.  It. There is nothing like a stage in any other field of work.  Sure, athletes have tryouts, and actors have auditions.  A stage is both.  It lasts many hours, is physically and mentally draining, and everyone is already expecting you to fail before you even begin.  It's the culinary equivalent of  getting jumped into a gang.  You get one chance to get it right, and being thrust into an unfamiliar, borderline hostile environment guarantees that if you don't fail outright, you are at very least probably going to make a stupid mistake. And at the end of your stage, it's all of this pressure that makes succeeding all the more sweet.  To have cooked well, and won over the cooks that let you into their home is a special thing.  It's a re-affirming rite of passage, and a fleeting feeling you only get to enjoy every once in a while.  Don't let your stage just pass on by. notes . that's not bechamel. holy shit!  I updated finally! podcasts are coming back.  no really.  they are. get some rest. burrito stepping into an open grease trap means youll probably need new shoes. that's pasta water.  not a deep fryer. fish &amp; farm seems like its becoming the new industry night off spot Quotes and Conversations. Me, to Gerardo :  Hey dude.  Tell your partner if he mouths off to me again, im gonna tie him up. Eddie :  Shhiiiiiiieeeeeett.  You wish!  You wish you could enter the dungeon! (I pinch Eddie's nipple.) Eddie :  Hey dude!  Not the nipples! Me :  Oh, im gonna get the nipples. Eddie :  ( pause )  I'm...ticklish. Me :  You can call him a pussy if you want to. Eddie :  I don't want to call him a pussy.  That would be the pot calling the kettle black. Me :  Eddie.  Want me to give you a hand massage? Eddie :  No. Me :  With my balls? Eddie :  That's not a massage. Goose :  Those new light fixtures are bad.  The block looks good now. Me :  Yeah dude, they're nice. Eddie :  And they reduce light pollution. Me :  Fuck off Ed Begley Jr. Goose :  Get the fuck outta here with that shit. Eddie :  Did you know I can ruin any conversation? "I'm a human snuggie.  You wrap me around you and watch t.v.  I come in different colors.  But mostly white." - Corey .  Human snuggie. Gerardo :  Can I borrow your skimmer thingy? Merrell :  It's called a spider. Gerardo :  I know a guy named spider. Me :  Elton John has hairless balls?  What? Goose and Dega :  I have hairless balls! Me :  I hate you guys. Me :  Would you bone down with a guy that wears a lot of gold jewelry? Dega :  How much gold jewelry? Me :  A lot. Dega :  Hell yeah.  Mr. T? Me :  You'd bone down with Mr. T? Me:   Wouldn't that be cool?  If you had a hinge on your balls?  You could move them like this. Goose :  Yeah.  But then you'd have to grease them.  You wouldn't want squeaky balls. Merrell :  My stomach is getting flat.  See? ( Gerardo is watching the conversation. ) Merrell :  This doesn't concern you Gerardo. Gerardo :  I was watching you touch yourself. "I evaluate every stripper on a case by case basis." - Eddie . Eddie :  You missed out.  I brought candy yesterday. Corey :  What are you?  A pervert?  Halloween's over bro. Eddie :  I think old people are cute.  I saw some old people going into Good Vibrations... Corey :  Stop.  Stop.  Sentences should not include old people and Good Vibrations. (Jamie is feeling my abs.) Jamie :  You should feel his abs.  It's impressive.  Merrell :  I'd rather feel yours.  (Jamie walks away) Merrell :  Was that weird? ( Merrell walks into the corner of the stove. ) Me :  Did you just jab your pussy with the oven? Merrell :  Yes.  Even though I don't have balls, it still hurts. Me :  Graceful.  You're a real pageant queen. Merrell :  I'm a fuckin lady. from top:  sautee, line up, al, a gift from ryan farr, mer-mer's balls, where am i vol. 6, fuck you in your ear, super bowl, you figure it out Would you rather work with someone that was fast but a completely out of control, or a person that was slower but composed and in control? CookhouseSF @ linecook As one of the latter I'd like to work with the former KellyNg1 @ linecook i would take slower over sloppy anyday. seems easier to speed up a nice slow snail than to tame a rabid slob. KyleCWilkinson @ linecook Fast and out of control. Would balance my slower and more composed workstyle. theNeilD @ linecook What about fast and composed with poise; that's true talent. Those are the people that make you better. aphexplotz @ linecook Slow and composed. I've worked with both, and I'd rather be down one than have someone I can't predict or control. rupski23 @ linecook composed and in control. no question about it. the kitchen is crazy enough that if your leader is spazzing then its gonna be bad.. FattedCalf @ linecook Composed. Definitely composed. In my experience, people who go too fast and don't think can really put a banana in the tailpipe. tournant @ linecook slow/in control, for sure. fast/out of control=messy, doesn't listen, takes shortcuts GuyArnone @ linecook fast&amp;out of control = slow for the extra time spent fixing Speedy's mistakes. gardenstatechef @ linecook what's the end product? give me speed and insanity if the plates are perfect. jesachrist @ linecook slower and controlled. Working too fast creates more problems than it solves, and in the long run slows down everyone most_impressive @ linecook Slower, but in control. Speed can be taught, but accuracy and commitment to perfection is more valuable, IMO. TheNPA @ linecook All headway gained by being fast is lost in the ER while the Doc stitches Speedy Gonzales back up. MatthewSievert @ linecook in it to win it baby. Planning will allow for swift execution. cookerguy @ linecook Slower and composed, just not too slow. Fast and out of control disrupts others as well. ingridc @ linecook If I had to choose I'd go door #2. Out of control cook drags the whole ship down w/ them. Slow affects the line too, but less so. ingridc @ linecook (and for the record I've been both quite enough, thanks!) Benjamin_Parks @ linecook Slower but in control. Chaos always creates more work (cleaning, fixing, etc), so quick chaos just produces more work faster. cnewton9 @ linecook neither, I always try to teach the kids that efficiency=speed vs accuracy, fast but sloppy no good, slow but perfect also no bueno Gchef703 @ linecook Slow,Composed and in control FTW! They can always gain speed later. But sometimes speed is what you need! good question. stresscake @ linecook absolutely slow composed and in control. Frenzy causes stressful miserable work environment. Calmness is more productive over LT Jerry: It's looking like a slow Tuesday night, and the cooks are coasting through their prep period, all laughs and smiles. There's a lightness in the air, and there are plans being made for days off. A special family meal is on the stove, and reggae plays on the dining room sound system. Everyone is a quiet shadow of their usual kitchen self. Except for Jerry. Jerry has his headphones in, playing Pantera so loudly that the cooks across the kitchen can hear it. He bounces around nervously, and just before service he jumps around and rolls his head like a boxer getting ready for a fight. The kitchen will do 135 covers tonight. Jerry will treat it like he just defeated the Roman army. Denise: The first thing Denise does when she comes in is crack a joke and say hello to everyone in the kitchen. She'll breeze through prep with a smile on her face. Then when things get busy on the second turn, she will completely lose her shit. There will be muttering under her breath, mise slammed around, and a constantly shaking head--like each order on her station is a personal insult to her mother. Denise will stop calling back tickets completely, until things escalate with her sous chef to the point of yelling and him kicking her off the station. Nights like this will happen at least once a week. Mark: Mark is the first cook to show up for work, every day. He sets up his station meticulously. There will not be a single detail missed, and he will be almost invisible while he works. There is a quiet dignity to him during this time. Then when service starts he start acting like someone has taped a live grenade to his back. There will be dips and dives and spins and some of the most violent movement you have ever seen. The other cooks will be watching him out of the corners of their eyes. At best, he will end up exhausting the entire kitchen. Jen: Jen is like a warm blanket; when she is next to you on the line, you feel comforted...happy. She helps quietly, cooks with dignity, and maintains a level of composure far beyond her years of experience on the line. She never raises her voice, or flails, or loses her temper. Her movements are so fluid they appear slow--yet she's always setting the pace for the other cooks. Sitting with her, eating family meal, you ask her how she does it. "It's just food, right? Why panic? I'm not doing open chest surgery or anything." Composure. It's what separates good cooks from great ones. It's that quality that causes a guest to sit and watch, transfixed by the grace and elegance of a dinner service. It's certainly not the most important quality for a cook to have...but it's something that kitchen lifers immediately recognize and come to respect in their peers. When I started cooking, my only goal was to be fast. Aside from not working clean and generally spinning around in my head, I probably looked like I was having a seizure. Then I started to notice the other cooks around me that were better than me. They were so collec
ed...so expressionless. Did they just not care as much as me? Did they just not take things as seriously? Well, no. They just knew what they were doing. As my sous chef at that time said to me: "You don't want to look like a little bitch." Time passed on, and as I slowly came to find a comfortable place in my own skin, my movements became more relaxed, but my head didnt. I still felt like I was one step away from flipping over my cutting board, throwing my salt at the food runner, and fist and elbowing my way out of the front door. It would take lying to myself to cure it; daily affirmations of "You're on control, you can cook, you're a motherfucking handsome badass." It sounds ridiculous. It was. And it worked. Finding a way to be composed makes the other cooks look differently at you. The crew will respect you, your chef will be quietly impressed by you, and your skills will improve. You'll have more energy. And you'll know what to tell Mark when he starts to lose it. So how do you deal wih it? Where do you find your place of balance? How do you compose yourself when things get crazy? Notes : That G-Shock lasted a hard 10 years on my wrist. I washed it by putting it through the dishwasher. If the girl is more Ghost World than Mean Girls, it's probably a good thing. When someone says they did a "stint" in a kitchen, what the fuck does that mean? In order to truly find balance in life, I think a person really has to explore every single corner of the human experience before coming back to center. Ingrid writes some good stuff.

Here I sit, at the end of 2009, and it feels like everything is different.  None of the details have changed;  I still live in San Francisco, and I still cook at Nopa as a sous chef.  I'm still writing this blog.  But when I look in the mirror, or have a quiet moment to myself, things feel different.  2009 was a crazy year for me.  It was a good year for me.  In 2009 this blog seemed to find its place.  Through things that seem as trivial as a twitter account, or a podcast, I met people and made friendships that are deeply important to me.  Through countless emails I was able to connect with cooks from all over the world.  As everything seemed to be expanding and moving towards one big interpersonal disconnect, the opposite ended up happening.  My world got smaller.  Then I turned 30, and came to realize that I needed to take life a little more seriously.  Soul searching, introspection, whatever.  I made some decisions, and decided to stick to them.  Then I woke up one day, and wow.  Things had changed. 2010 is a little scary to think about.  A friend of mine said to me "2010 is the first year I haven't been excited about."  I had never thought about it like that, and im not sure that's my sentiment.  But it does feel like a giant, scary beast that I have to tackle...like im getting into the ring with a faceless terror.  In the following year im going to to be faced with figuring out whether im a better writer or a better cook.  There's a chance that this blog could end in 2010.  There isnt an infinite amount of topics for me to write about here.  Sometimes I feel like im just regurgitating the same old garbage.  Add to that the fact that im going to be a father, and want to open a restaurant this year, and things start to get very cloudy and scary and im suddenly very aware that nothing feels perfect or right, but things just are.  It's an amazing thing to be faced with the rest of your life.  I thought I knew what it would feel like, and how I would deal with it.  I don't.  And I suspect that's perfectly normal. The thing is, its not like anything is actually ending.  If anything, things are just beginning.  After a year like 2009, where things were so good and changed so much, I can only imagine what's coming.  It's possible that just being daunted about knowing that you have to make something for yourself is enough to leave you shaking...but maybe its better to try to run through all of the insecurity and bullshit now, before everyone is toasting at midnight. So whats next?  What's going to happen come July, or next December?  Shit, what's going to happen next week?  Does the fear or uncertainty ever go away?  Do things ever start to feel right, or perfect?  Or is it more important to just let things happen?

It's the easiest equation quality ingredients and a bit of care equal good results. swedishmike @ linecook Taking good ingredients and making them taste bad. It's a cold Tuesday night, and you're on a cook's night out; something your crew has looked forward to for days. The plan is to hit a string of new restaurants, eating as much as you can, then topping it all off with bourbon and shameful behavior. Rules are in place: no eating anywhere that anyone has been before. And no salads, pizza, or fancy renditions of mac n cheese. Things started out well enough. There were some tasty fried bits, the required offal dish, a polite terrine. But the in the past hour, things have taken a turn. There was raw fish paired with fried cheese. There was a risotto that was so rich and salty that your fish cook polished off the wine, straight from the bottle. And the lamb saddle was so over-techniqued that your best-of-friends hot apps cooks started screaming at each other over which part was the meat, and which was the marrow-wrapped tongue and kidney croquette. And it was cold. The night ends with you and the grill guy sitting on a stoop, having a smoke, wondering what happened. "Maybe they were having an off night..." "It's only their second month. Did you hear the chef de cuisine came from Mugaritz? Maybe they're just settling..." "Remember that case of nasty chicken bones we got last Wednesday? Maybe there's an epedemic of bad stocks sweeping the city..." "I saw that dude Damien in their kitchen. I hate that guy..." Bad food stays with you. It haunts you. You feel violated--your precious time and money wasted. It's made even worse when friends, or expectations are involved. And it's something that you are more likely to experience as the craft of cooking expands and evolves. But why? Is it as simple as a cook that doesn't care, or that isn't truly passionate about their craft? Of course. But I think in most cases it's something else completely. Bad cooking happens when things fall out of balance. Temperature. Tastes. Textures. A cook's focus. A cook's attitude. Have you ever eaten a meal with so much technique that the kitchen forgot about the actual taste? Have you ever had a meal so rustic you were left wondering if the kitchen was just slopping it out? Remember that night on the line where you were so focused on your meat temps that your veg was constantly scorched? Remember that night on the line when you were having so much fun that you kept forgetting to add that garnish you worked on for an hour? Balance is essential to good cooking--on every level, and in every position. It's the most difficult thing to achieve--and when it's happening, it's almost invisible. A cook's personality in general is not balanced. A group of people, given to such highs and lows, and dedicated only to pleasure and sensuality...where do you find balance in that? As cooks comes to know themselves, their awareness of balance slowly starts to reveal itself. They can feel the push and pull of their own emotions. Their heart swells and almost bursts when things are good, and shatters to pieces when things are bad--but they find a way to stay anchored in the middle, head down, with only a deep breath as evidence that they're feeling anything at all. Coercing their mind into this mental middle ground starts to translate into the pan, then onto the plate. The quiet balance in the cooks mind tells them when to hold back and when to push--be it with seasoning, speed, or technique. It's a mental high wire act that's exhausting, with far greater consequences. If you fall off the wire, you die. Big deal. If you cook bad food, you've lost guests and shamed your kitchen. You actually have to live with that. Some cooks never find balance--and that's ok with them. They produce food that they're happy with--and that the vast majority of diners would be happy to eat. But if the goal is to get better...to progress...to contribute, then isn't it important to find a sustainable method for mentally and physically producing your craft?
