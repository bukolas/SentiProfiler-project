We’ve added a new cartoonist to cagle.com, Omar Abdallat from The Addustour newspaper in Jordan.  I’m sure Omar’s cartoons will make some of our readers angry as he often draws bloodthirsty-monster-Israel cartoons, which is common fare for cartoonists in Arab countries - but unlike some Arab cartoonists, Omar draws on other subjects too, and he has a nice style that our mostly American audience can easily understand.  (It isn’t easy to find foreign cartoonists that our American audience can understand!) I just got back from a cool editorial cartoonists conference in Colombia last week. I’m an editorial cartooning wonk and it was great fun to go to a conference where I didn’t know the cartoonists. In fact, the Colombian political cartoonists rarely get together themselves and it was interesting for them to meet each other. Bogota is a huge city of about 8.5 million people, full of universities and libraries and a thriving community of cartoonists. Colombian politics are crazy, bloody, complex and difficult for me to digest in just a week of cramming. Colombia is the second biggest country in South America and the third largest recipient in the world of US foreign aid, because of all the drug issues there. The US State Department brought me to Colombia on a speaking tour to attend the conference as the only American cartoonist.
