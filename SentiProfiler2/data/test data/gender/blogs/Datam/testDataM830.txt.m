As I read about the massive earthquake this morning in Chile and the resulting tsunami, my mind raced with prophetic thoughts. Then I went to the Word; I wound up in I Kings 19.Perhaps it is wise to wait for that Still Small Voice that He will surely send to us if there is more to this or if there is something we need to know. That is not to diminish the power of this event or its possible prophetic significance.
