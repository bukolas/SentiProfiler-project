IMAX videographer Peter Rubi stands in the foreground as a Discovery Channel videographer interviews DOW driver Herb Stein in the background.  And behind it all?  A wall cloud scraping the ground roughly 60 seconds before forming the first (and only) tornado Vortex 2 intercepted in year one of field operations.  This was shot on June 5, 2009, in Goshen County, Wyoming.The giant retractable antenna on the back of Doppler on Wheels #6 is designed to both loft weather instrumentation high into the air (where ground obstructions do not interfere with it) and to act as a radio repeater for communication between storm researchers. I found this little bit of nostalgia recently while working through the many-years long backlog of old film and slides that I had from my non-digital days; this is one of my first ever storm shots, shot back in 1999 or 2000, back before I took up storm chasing.  Don't remember the exact date on this one; what I do remember is that this was the first time that I really wished I owned a camera with a wider lens, as the arcus cloud in the distance (rapidly approaching Kearney, Nebraska) covered almost the entire sky and looked like something straight out of the end of the world.  The lightning bolt in this shot is pure luck; it happened to strike at the exact moment I pressed the shutter.
