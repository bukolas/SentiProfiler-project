There is so much in health care that can be changed to improve care, but society's view of what is expected from a doctor, a nurse, a hospital, or rehab facility needs to be adjusted. Research is showing that people recouperate better in their own environment. Also, research shows, that longer hospital stays increase the chance of acquiring a hospital based infection. People need to know that staying in the hospital is not the best thing if they are medically stable and can be transferred to home or a rehab facility.
