And it's a "traditional" sort of story telling that I have in mind here.  Not the kind played out in big city court rooms between corporate crooks and ravenous lawyers but the kind that brings to mind the dusty, dry heat of a Western high-noon.  A frontier town sheriff on the hunt for a thieving outlaw.  Or in the case of Timothy Olyphant's Raylen Givens, a U.S. Marshall on the trail of a Neo-Nazi with a rocket launcher.  After all, this isn't Deadwood we're talking about here.
