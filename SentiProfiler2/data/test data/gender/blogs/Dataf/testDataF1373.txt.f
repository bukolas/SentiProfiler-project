Happy New Year everybody! What an incredible year 2009 was. It was such a great journey and I have met so many wonderful and talented people along the way. Thank you to everyone who has participated in my portrait project here. It was such an honor to have spent time with you and to take your portrait. I am so lucky to have had the chance to meet people from all over. I know some of you thought I should make myself the last portrait but I had already shot myself earlier this year. Take a scroll back and find me! But the main reason I chose not to make myself the last portrait was because I wanted to be surprised. I didn't want to plan or think about that too much. I also knew that it would be hard to choose one person so shooting a family seemed to be a great way to end the project. I have been going back and forth with whether or not I should continue the project in 2010 and I have also decided not to continue L'image Quotidienne in this new year. I am sorry if I am disappointing anyone but this project was to be for one year and although it would be great to continue on, indefinitely for that matter, there are some other projects that I would like to work on. I know I won't be able to completely stop shooting portraits of random people I see on the street but please look for those posts on my M Photo blog . Thank you everyone for your kind comments and support. I am so grateful. But before I say goodbye I wanted to leave you all with two last portraits. They are the same ladies I shot at the beginning of this blog. What a difference a year makes! And please don't forget to check out what my December portraits are into. Super cool stuff people! Thanks again and all the best in 2010!!
