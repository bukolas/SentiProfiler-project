When I was younger, my Dad would take me for drives in the car. He never had a particular destination, it was just his way of spending one on one time with me. Usually he wanted to talk about something or just talk about the day, and sometimes he would just drive and we would listen to the oldies on the radio. I didn't truly get it back then, but I get it now.

My family of 4 went on a Carnival cruise in Oct '08. We cruised on Carnival Sensation. I had an 8 and 3 year old. Camp Carnival was AWESOME. The kids would get mad when I got them. There was so much for them to do that they never got bored. They have a great staff of very friendly people who take the time to get t know yorchild even if they are only with them for a few days. I would like to ass tat cruising is the best way to go for our family. We get all the food we want, shows, babysitting so the parents get some alone time, games, dancing, gambling...need I say more.
Woke up at 5.30AM and read my morning email, as always. I usually have an alarm to read it at 4.30AM but it's a Sunday. Just caught the husband leaving for an offroading on his bike and went right back to sleep, after asking him to take care. 
You never go into an ultrasound thinking there will be something wrong, at least I never did. It's the whole "This happens to other people, not me" disease. The idea that my baby isn't in perfect health and may have to endure pain during the first few days of his life is scary, or that he could even be enduring pain now.
We cruised during the week of Thanksgiving and had THE BEST TIME OF OUR LIVES as a family. Every detail was amazing, from the free arcade cards delivered to our rooms for our kids, to the guest towels folded into animal shapes. We got an amazing deal through Small World Travel (check them out online). Our family of four cruised for only $1300 total for a 4 day, 3 night cruise to Nassau and Castaway Cay. On chilly days, the crew sprang into action with trays of hot cocoa delivered to everyone.
I've found out that my best friend plans to come and visit me for a few days the weekend after Christmas, and additionally, since we aren't going to Florida this year as planned, my family from Merritt Island are going to drive to South Carolina to visit for about a week. I unfortunately will only get to see them for one day since I'm going to be flying to New Jersey to spend a week with my boyfriend and his family for New Years. So much traveling, so little time!
This really is a rectangle sewed together in a tube, but it was good practice with a ribbed pattern.  And the yarn that I have is a bit too chunky for this, but I think it could work over my usual leather gloves for some extra warmth.  Or to wear in the cold office and still be able to type.  At the advice of a friend I'm going to try to learn a new technique with each new project.  So for my second project I learned how to cable knit.  It actually is pretty easy.  And now I can look at my store-bought sweaters and see exactly how they are made.
No blog post yesterday because I was preoccupied with getting ready for the show this weekend. I got to stop off in Tigard to visit Mia and help get her face trimmed up for the show. She was actually quite good. She wasn't thrilled about me trimming her face during the time that she stayed with us. But then again, she was much younger. I also practiced stacking her rear. Every dog is different and I'm so used to Bess who is pretty much fine with whatever I do to her. Mia takes a lighter touch to maneuver her rear feet into the ideal position. Otherwise she likes to lift the leg WAY up into the air. And then it's much more difficult to place it where it should be. And it looks pretty funny!
I use to belong to quite of few different backs and one of them was bank of america...i had so many problems with them it came to the point my money was starting to get missing!  Thats when I had to go down there and find out whats going on and close my account immediatly and opened up with Wachovia!  Ever since I opened up with Wachovia Back never had a problem with my money, checks, atm card, and ect.
I took jetblue on my way home from Italy, and the service was excellent. The flight attendant kept the passengers laughing the whole trip with her comedy routine. She was hilarious, and extremely friendly. Also, the unlimited snacks is a bonus what with airlines giving up on serving meals...overall a great experience.
Hi everyone, I bought the 1" solia flat iron about 3 weeks ago because I wanted a flat iron that straightens my hair as fast as it can curl it, and is not as heavy as my Conair flat iron.I came to find out though that it doesn't straighten my hair as fast and it does tug on my ends a little.I have it on about 350 because i have thin hair and i dont want it to break as much but i still have to go over pieces of hair about 3 times. I really like however , how it curls my hair with only one slow time of going through a piece, but it does leave the hair dry afterwards.
So if you want a flat iron to just straighten your hair you might want to get another one that is way cheaper and does the same job. I cant complain about the curling part, though, so I just straighten my hair with the Conair and curl it with this one.. so this is my hair after straightening it with the Solia 1"-took me 20 min.
USAA automobile insurance was initially for military officers only (but open to all military members and fam now). My dad went to the Naval Academy and served during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He completed his term right before troops were "frozen" for Vietnam.Since my dad had USAA, all family members could also sign up. I was on my dad's policy when I was a kid, and I continued my service when I "grew up."
I grew up in a small town in Connecticut the second of four children. When it was time to "spread my wings," I attended Ricks College in Rexburg, ID. At the end of those two years, I transferred to Southern Utah University in Cedar City, UT where I graduated with a BS degree in teaching, emphasis on Physical Education.
I am excited at the thought of going "back to teaching" and still being able to by home with my kids. I love children and helping them learn and develop, and I look forward to getting to know you and your kids.I am excited at the thought of going "back to teaching" and still being able to by home with my kids.

There are tons of Radar Detectors out on the market these days. The question is: Which one do you buy?
There are cheap ones and expensive ones. There are some things in life that cheaper is better. Radar Detectors are not one of those things! The more you spend the better off you are!
The Valentine One is a state of the art Radar Detector. It can sense radar from the front, back and sides and tell you exactly where it is.
Blizzard be damned!  Brandon and I holed up in the podcasting hatch in the midst of what New Yorker's referred to as "Snowmageddon" this week to bring you the good word on the week in TV!  Ellen on Idol, Kate on the loose and The Jersey Shore crew on lockdown are all items on the docket on this week's show.  Have some thoughts of your own on these pressing matters?  Then head to out our Facebook group and be heard!  And keep Toob Tied on constant rotation by subscribing to us on iTunes!
Having to deal with the Fall weather isn't just limited to the rainy season and the onset of cold weather. It also brings with it a lot of wind, which will pick up the dust, and virtually fling it at your eyes. It is very similar to walking during the summer and having specks of pollen get into your eyes. The discomfort is enough to drive you crazy every time, and anyone who has even had something in their eye knows the feeling all too well. When this happens, you run the risk of scratching your eye if you are not careful on how you deal with it.
All facials follow the same basic structure and order. They will begin with makeup removal and cleansing. The cleansing is normally repeated twice to ensure it is thorough. Then comes some method of exfoliation to remove dead skin cells and smooth the surface of the skin. A massage is then performed that can include all or some of the scalp, face, neck, shoulders, back and even the hands or feet. Next a mask is applied, chosen according to the client’s specific skin type. Once the mask has been removed the skin is toned and the final eye, neck and face creams are applied.
I think that I mentioned a while ago that I've decided to pick up knitting.  I've been meaning to for a while now, and I recently found my starter kit so I got going.  It does seem to be the thing to do these days.  And there are a few women on campus who get together once a week to knit over lunch, so it is a nice thing to do to relax a bit at work (not that I really have the time).  Anyhoo, I am happy to announce that I have two projects under my belt now!
Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis were the best Sci-Fi shows out there. Then the moron producers had to cancel the two series and put on Stargate Universe with a bunch of snot nosed bubble gummers. As a adult I hate watching shows that mistakenly put stupidity in a show in place of drama. Writers can't and I guess the producers can't make a decent movie or television series without stupidity. And on top of the stupidity, they think we want to watch a bunch of stupid kids acting like stupid kids.
I had in mind that Precious was a comedy film. It most definately is NOT. It does have some moments that will make you laugh, but this is a heavy film. Really heavy. But, it is a film that will make an impression and stick with you. Definately worth watching.Precious gets kicked out of school at age 16, because she is pregnant - yet again. She already went through this one time. So, the school farms her out to an alternative school.The alt school is a chance for a second chance, but the deck is really stacked against Precious.
Fortunately, scientists have developed an imaging system that analyses skin and predicts how it will age. It's called Visia Complexion Analysis, and not only can it predict how our skin will age, but the rate at which it will. It provides a snapshot of what damage has already occurred, and can thus provide a realistic assessment of our skin. The system looks at the major issues in skin aging - brown spots; pores; the bacteria underneath the skin that causes acne, redness, and uneven skin tone; as well as wrinkles, and UV damage. It's a great way to quantify the effects of our environment and our current skin care regime.
Hi my name is Dee I am new to blogging and I hope that I can get use to it sooner than later. I love make up, the art of it and the creativity of it. I am starting this blog so that I can give you reviews on new products and older products also. I am a very fair person and you can be assured that I will be giving you my honest opinion. Also if you have something in mind that you would like me to review let me know and I will try to make it happen.
I will also try to do some step by step tutorials. I will be showing you guys how different thing work and how to store your make up. I hope this works out well and to hear from you guys.
I cannot get enough of this show and its books. The plots and the chemistry between the characters is fantastic and believable. They all seem down to earth. The show has equal part humor and seriousness which I love. Also, when they have emotional story lines the actors portray it so well. Also John Barrowman is just amazing.
It is fine unless you have to deal with customer service and then the experience starts to go downhill.  They range from unfriendly and unhelpful to completely inconsistent and give conflicting advice and information.
And heaven forbid you don't notice damage to the car before you take it out because you will then be stuck with the $500 fine- I'd rather take a cab and not have the hassle.
Real school starts on Wednesday. I am excited but nervous about that too. I am still scrambling to put together my class on modernist poetry and just decided to have a course website for the first time ever. One reason is swine flu (we're supposed to make it easy for students to keep up from home so that they don't spread their piggy germs around) but really I just want to be able to add online readings throughout the quarter instead of choosing everything now.
A great cosmetic line that you should look into is the Maybelline cosmetics line. They have everything your need to look and feel your best. One of the best items in their makeup line is their mascara. If you need
 waterproof, lash lengthening or any other type of mascara, they have it and in all different shades. You are sure to find the one that will work best for you. Their products work well and perform completely. Their prices are on the lower end compared to other cosmetics in their category. They also have lipstick and face makeup and much more for every cosmetic need that you may have.

You can find them at many stores and shop online with them, too. You will want to pick up two of an item when you purchase the Maybelline cosmetics. It is a good idea to have a set of makeup for use at your home and another set of cosmetics to take with you on the road.
I have been used for almost 4 years. The car is just "nice". I remember it never made me " "terrible". I would say that it is economical. More, the size is meet to family riding. I mean the utility is kind of "a Choice". Frankly speaking, I never dissapoint to put my money for this " marvelous car
Yesterday, I cleaned up Joyce Road , so today I cleaned my street ( Campbell) because it was full of trash and it was very awful and gross. I thought it is time for me to get up and clean up this street before it gets worse.
The best part about being a pirate is that we don't have to explain why we do what we do. So if I laugh when saying 'poop deck', 'seacock', or 'why haven't we gotten this autopilot fixed yet?', you better not look sideways at me, or i'll keelhaul you. Also, laughing makes you live longer. And if you're a pirate, you know very well why you would want to do that.
Whether you commute by bus, train, car, or on foot, lugging a laptop around can get cumbersome. Between that and everything else in your bag, your back can get seriously strained.

We give you some of our favorites.The Editors' Choice Toshiba mini NB305-N410 ($400 direct, 4.5 Stars) is one of our top-rated netbooks. It weighs in at 2.9lbs. and has a screen-size of 10.1 inches. This pint-sized computer has a full-sized keyboard for those who don't want adjust their typing habits for less space.

At the Game Developers Conference, which just wrapped up yesterday, many attendees wondered about one of the final sessions held at the show. Little was known about it, except its title, "Metaphysics of Game Design," and its speaker, someone called "Phaedrus."
It turned out that the mysterious session was being headed by none other than SimCity and Spore creator Will Wright."I am not Phaedrus," Wright said, as he made his way to center stage amid thunderous applause.
As the name suggests, melanoma occurs in the melanocytes cells. Melanocytes contain a substance called melanin that are responsible for skin pigmentation (skin color) and also help protect the skin against the UV rays of the sun. When you go out in the sun, the melanocytes produce more melanin for protection and thus the skin gets tanned. Melanocytes sometime mutate faster than other normal skin cells; as a result, they accumulate together and form tumors. Malignant tumors can also affect the healthy tissues and further give rise to new tumors in the body.
Living in a bicycle-friendly town like I do, I can live without the hassles and expense of owning a car because I use Zipcar for mega-buying and out of town adventures. Zipcar takes care of the maintenance and insurance and gives a generous allowance for gas (they provide a gas card and up to 180 miles per 24-hour reservation). It's also fun having a variety of cars to drive; most in my university town are compact, but there is also an SUV when needed.
There is a trail of thought which heads to nowhere. There is a landscape you always dream of but can never happen to lay your eyes on but in your thoughts. There is a valley lost in the wilderness which beholds all the things that you need to fathom out your non-fathomable life. Talking about life, there is yet another life in your own existance; you could never ever reason out or argue with her for a just sacrifice of actions towards you for your thoughts to reach the sanctuary of things beyond your territorial reach.

There was an escapist. He was lost in the material world. He took a break from it. He went out to make his life change her route, and forced her to give him every thing that he thought is some unknown energy. He renounced his lifetime of possessions and came down to streets. He ran away. He ran away from everything that beholds the people's hearts to cling to their everyday existance, doing that what has been imposed on them by the faggot society that we so often cling to for our happiness.

He roamed around like a lost vagabond, striving for his daily bread and shelter from the formidable weather.


"Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat-
Come hither, come hither, come hither!
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather."
-W. Shakespeare.

Quite true. The strife which the escapist had in his mind for the non-distinguished facets of life came to benefit him. He was alone, but he, for a change, had to battle against none but the nature, at the worst. But he got what he wanted. He was happy.

He wandered places, went to the mountains. The fields of innocence seemed to enrapture his thoughts. The wind sang it's own song for him. He was like a wandering piece of energy, where there is purpose, and there is nobody to oppose him or obstruct him. His naiveity, his faults didn't matter any more to anyone. The negativity seemed to seep out of him into the dust that he tread on. He was his own master and his own slave. He went to the mountains. He wandered around, not for self-dicovery, but to get back to where he came from, in that state. The state that we existed in when we were born, care-free, loving, cheerful. The flora and fauna were his friends. There was a bittersweet melody in the nature, sighing softly as she deteriorated wearily somewhere on the mother earth, but the sound of her said that if nature had eyes, those motherly, loving eyes were trying to appease the grief of humans and calling them towards her. Towards more simple things in life. No life could be simpler than this. And he felt that pang.
Dear Mom,

Mental illness runs in our family. You mom, Dianne was Bipolar. Her mom was clinically depressed and stoned constantly. Her husband, or your grandpa was also Bipolar. Me, though have not yet had a therapist tell me I have a disorder. Knock on wood.

I could never wrap my mind around your illness, but now I can recognize it more clearly. You always told me about mental illness, but I never understood yours. I remember coming home from school, and trying to talk to you, but you wouldn't respond, you would just sit there. Your eyes were angry.I asked why you were so mad at me, and you wouldn't say a word. I never knew. Then you would get up and slam things like doors. I shook every time you slammed a door. You would take glasses and throw them at me, and I would dodge them. I remember the day one hit me. You were screaming at your boyfriend and trying to rip out your hair. You were yelling and hitting your self with your fists in your head. I begged you to stop, I tried to grab your hands, but you would just get madder. I cried hysterically. Your make up was running all down your face and smears of black and red covered your face. You told me to leave, that you hated me, that you didn't want me anymore. This probably intended to make me stop crying, made me cry harder. You went to the wall and started banging on it. You told your boyfriend what a piece of shit he was. You took the light bulb right out of the lamp and threw it on the ground. I yelled at you to stop once more. You walked into the kitchen, where I was standing and grabbed a glass you threw it at me, but missed and hit the window. You turned around and I thought you were done but then you turned again, picked up another glass and threw it. I couldn't dodge that one , and it hit me in the neck and chin and fell to the ground, where it shattered. I broke down and fell to the ground, around all the glass. That's when you stood there and stared. Then you walked away and left. You slammed the door again. I laid on the floor crying and your boyfriend tried to get me to stand up but I wouldn't. I fell asleep there. When I woke up I decided to pick up the mess. I saw a pool of blood next to the light bulb you had cracked earlier. When I went to clean it up with a towel I threw up. I saw so disgusted. I still cannot stomach blood. I finally got myself together and finished the mess. You walked in later that night and left the lights off. I was in my homemade bed on the floor when you laid down and curled up next to me. I was awake, but you didn't know that. I could smell the alcohol on your breathe, it was outrageous. I'm almost afraid to say that I think your illness raised me.
Love, your daughter.
Well, let's see. I am nothing special. Just an ordinary girl. The only thing that makes me special are my family, friends and my smoking hot boyfriend Ernie. Along with my mother I own and operate a automotive upholstery shop. We Rock. Yes we are that damned good at what we do. I don't always like it, but I do it well and I am proud of the work we do. I have two boys. 15 and 9. They are the force that holds my universe together. My duct tape. Both are beautiful, intelligent, caring wonderful kids and I am blessed to have them. There is also my niece who is 15. She lives here off and on, and we love her like crazy. I have a ton of other nieces as well. All are special and I wouldn't know what to do without any of them. My friends have saved me more than once. The ones here and the ones that live 10 miles up the road. Always there for me to lend a helping hand or an ear. They are fun and crazy and understand my weird sense of humor or else they are just laughing at me. Thank you all. Ernie came along when I least expected it and grabbed hold of my heart. I hope he never lets go. He has added joy to my life I didn't even know was missing. And I met him right here on Myspace. Guess that means I should be nicer to Tom, huh?
You know that saying, "when it rains, it pours"?

Monday night, I found out that the dog I grew up with is not doing so well. My mom didn't think he'd make it through the night. I cried. A lot.

First thing Tuesday morning, my car nearly gets hit while backing out of my parking spot because some idiot was flying through the parking lot. She had the audacity to honk at ME and make me pull back into the spot so she could continue speeding by. Thank God I didn't get hit!

Tuesday afternoon, I deal with a pain-in-the-butt coworker who I simply can't handle. One of those argue-for-the-sake-of-it people trying to give me more work and make my life harder. Because, you know, it's not like I have a 600-page book to publish in three weeks, or anything. Gah.

Oh, and my boss scolded me for talking to a coworker, in front of my entire floor. Super.

Tuesday evening, I found out my childhood dog is being put down Wednesday night at 5:30 p.m. In my distraught state, I put a thermos of coffee in my purse. When I put my purse down, the cup spills over, filling my Coach bag and drowning my iPhone.

Today, my father-in-law is going in for tests as he has been rediagnosed with cancer. We are praying the xrays show it is not lung or bone. Although we're all trying not to worry, it's a little overwhelming since we know it could be serious.

It's not that I want a pity party; I just want this week to be over so I can spend the weekend in bed recovering. I know that God says he won't give us more than we can handle, and I know I can handle this (other than it putting me in a bad mood), but does it have to be everything at once?
How dare they (the media) come on the morning news shows and show webcam pics of the beach off the Hilton, bright and sunny, beckoning, promising, and then tell us that it is but forty nine out, and the blessed Gulf waters are 55 degrees. What kind of glory to know that this is the coldest March since such records were kept.

I go out to do morning barn chores wearing my pajamas. No kidding. Beneath my jeans and sweat shirt and puffy jacket and ski cap, and the only gloves I have are flowered gardening gloves, I wear my pajamas. Even the horses hardly know me, fat with clothes like the Michelin Man.

There was frost on the grass, and no sign of the tortoise that has taken up residence near the Magnolia tree. They dig holes, tunnels, mazes beneath the earth, and I never know from which "door" it will emerge. The barn cats sit on the tin roof to gain warmth from the meagre rays of the sun. The horses do not mind the cold, but seem quite comfortable in their fuzzy winter coats. They nuzzle the thin cover of ice from the water trough to drink, and munch quite happily on the frosted pasture.

The robins are drunk all through the yard, from eating the berries off the Brazilian Pepper trees. I doubt they will sober up until April for their flight north. A few are so besotted, I have to step carefully as I cross the lawn in order not to step on them. Fortunately, my spoiled fat cat is too full to bother them.

But, as cold as it is here, I feel for my kin in the true north. The house there has had frozen water pipes for a month (they get their water for use from the spigot at the pump.  ) The man of the house goes to the gym after work so he can shower.

The worst I heard was when my daughter called to say the dog was frozen to the driveway.  It's a little and spoiled dog, and coming out from the warm warm house to do her morning "chores", and stood for a moment on the concrete driveway to bark at a squirrel,, and thus froze to the concrete. My daughter had to bring a pan of warm water out and pour it on her feet to free her.  It was minus ten at the time.

Still. It seems a dang cold winter that is hanging on far too long, EVERYWHERE.
What a fine weekend in my world! Ughhhh Life goes on and I look for those better days!

Kat is flying into DC tomorrow from Italy; she’ll spend 1 1/2 days there in DC, and then fly home. Maybe she’ll get to rest up some before arriving here; she said her feet are tired! I’ve Missed her like crazy. It’s been so quiet around here!

Tim is coming State side towards the end of the month and depending how long the processing takes I’m not real certain when he’ll be back here but I know it’ll be sooner then I originally thought.

One thing I do know is change is coming my way once again, big changes, and whether I want to or not I’m going there, rest assured I will roll with it; which isn’t easy cause these days the unexpected seems to really want to jump out and mess with me!

I use to love change, any kind of change; if I didn’t feel it then I’d make it. When did I become that person who really doesn’t like change who hangs on to what I know and like till I’ve drained the life out of it? Ha! I believe that happened when I hit 40 and thanks to all my friends above 40 who didn’t warn me it was coming…

Anyone care to share how their weekend was?

How about u, do u like change?

Does ur furniture attack u on occasion? 

Does this happen to u with or without alcohol use?

I couldn’t imagine what a little alcohol in this mix would do to me! Seriously! LOL
Check out Mischief’s Musical March Madness by clicking the picture below. It really does ROCK almost as much as she does!
OK March 1st and now a new mind set.  At least I am trying to focus on the positive:):):)
It has been a fun past few days , I have been blog browsing.  Blog browsing can be quite fun, but sometimes I would get a little kick in the gut when you see all of the family blogs.  Really, everyone is so in love with their kids?!?!  I mean I unconditionally love my children and do everything I can for them but really people.  Maybe because most of them only have about 1 to 2 kids, but is everyone being so real on their blogs.... " I am married to the best guy...... I have three wonderful kids......blog, blog, blog and so on."  Get my picture?
Really I do have a great husband and three wonderful kids.  I ask myself all the time how did I become so blessed .  I am working on finding myself again because being a wife and mom can cause a woman to lose themselve, so I will not be boasting about my wonderful family.  Sorry, at least not right now!
Sometimes it seems so surreal that I am  somebodies mother, it is like when did this happen?!?!

Then as I navigate the new world of blogging I am amazed at the layouts and wonder who the hell has all this time on their hands?!?!?  I am lucky to be able to have the time to blog when I can and it is not very often.  Do any of you work?!?!  I guess there are lots of creative people in this world !  Ok that does not sound like a good mindset does it.
Its been a lot of fun out here the past few days. I've had around 30 knots, I'm headed almost right for Cape Horn, and I'm going fast!! Yesterday I got up to 16.6 knots! Today has been a little lighter but not much. Though doing any work is pretty difficult and it had been gray and rainy, I'm really enjoying everything out here.

I've got seas of about 15 feet, not that huge, but they definitely make for a bumpy ride! The cushion on my nav station seat keeps sliding under the desk everytime a big wave comes. Its making writing this a little difficult, typing a few sentences in between sliding under the desk.... I'll have to rig up something to hold it in place.

I was informed by a friend the other day that its spring break, so I decided that its about time I pulled out the school books. That lasted for a good half hour, then I decided that I shouldn't over do it on the first day, climbed into all my foul weather gear and spent the next few hours up on deck. I love being outside weather its flat clam or rough. Its my favorite thing to do whether I'm working on something out there or just sitting on deck watching water rush under Wild Eyes. Even on the worst of days, when you're not feeling so great about being in the middle of the ocean all by your self, there is something about being up on deck that makes any sad or lonely thoughts disappear almost immediately.

Yesterday I went out to try and get some good pictures for the blog. I ended up spending a good hour out there, getting soaked, and not getting one picture that showed what its really like out here right now. Pictures are great and do show what things are like out here better than I could ever describe them, but they still don't seem show it as it really is.

Its about 70 degrees out right now!! Better go find my jacket!
Dear Mom,

I realize now that you have ruined my perception of men. Actually, let me rephrase that, I feel like like your actions have ruined my perception of men. The way I saw you interact with men, was not normal. I have come to that conclusion.
You told them you loved them, you held on too tight, you cried when they left, and you cried when they were there. His name was Brian. He was Caucasian, with dark hair and dark eyes. His hair would never be combed and his frizzy hair would be in this rediculous Jerry curl. I hated him. He had a wife, and two kids and you had no problem with that. The drugs had to have played a huge part in those decisions, because a normal person would not have made such rash decisions.His face was pale and stubbly. His chin was very ugly and his cheekbones were high for a man. He was nothing but skin and bones. He drove a Volkswagen. At first, I like him and his family. His wife's name was Lalani. She was a big woman. Her kids were so cute. She hated Brian for his drugs, and his drinking. I hated Brian for his drugs, for treating my mom disgusting and for his pedophile friend. That relationship made me sick. I walked down stairs one day and saw you having sex with him. It was so gross, I didn't know you guys were sexual, you were friends with his wife for god sake. I remember when she came over and put a knife in your face and I thought she was going to kill you, but she didn't. You were really upset when he followed her back to their old apartment and kissed his kids goodnight. You cried and when he came back, you cried in his arms, while he soothed you with his fake excuses and his gross touch. When I went with him to go get coffee for you one morning when we were living in that prostitute motel he took your coffee and dropped little things in it, and I had no idea what was going on. Later that day, you and him sat down and did whippits. I tried to drown out the loud noise that was coming from that stupid ass metal thing. The room was tiny and you had sex in the same room as me with him. When you guys argued, the cops came and dragged you out naked. It was embarrassing. They let me stay with him. How nice of them right? NOT. I can't believe that your most influential relationship only last a few months. I remember it like it was yesterday, and I see myself in you all the time when it comes to relationships. It's hard to comprehend. I don't ever want to be in a relationship, I feel to young and restless. This I believe is directly from you.
Love Winona.
The dogs have been in and out all morning, but for the most part are playing indoors as we all watch the snow falling - pretty, like falling snow should be.

We still don't have much furniture in our living/dining room, which makes it a fun playroom with its slick wood laminate floor. They all love tossing and running after their balls.

Every once in awhile I have to get up and help retrieve a ball that has rolled under the computer desk or behind the oak dining chairs against the wall, in line to be repaired. The last time I was assisting Chelsea and Harley over in the far corner, I picked up the folded vinyl tablecloth that had been knocked off a box, and then gathered up the gauzy curtains that had slithered off a chair.
 
"Sorry, babies, I don't see your ball anywhere down here," I sympathized, and started back across the room to my desk. 

On one of the futon chairs in front of the TV table lay Frankie, relaxing for a change and calmly watching the other dogs as they searched high and low. He rested his chin on one big front paw, stretching the other paw out beside him, guarding not one, but two small rubber balls.
 
We made eye contact as I passed by, and the sparkle of amusement was unmistakable.

That boy!
so this is my first blog and i have no clue how or where to begin so i am going to just start typing. right now i am currently sitting at home by myself. (boyfriend is working today at the golf course, he is a golf pro assistant at a near by country club) he pretty much stays busy allll day during the summer where today they have a mens tournament. so i was sitting here thinking about starting to blog. my best friend ashely gave me the idea of blogging as where she blogs frequently due to her being a stay at home mom she has time on her hands (not that much because she is raising a 1 year old). (she is not in the picture above). In the picture above is actually one good good friend of mine that i work with in the emergencey department as a registered nurse named Laura. I threw her a bachlorette party last saturday at a local bar in downtown roanoke. we had tons of cutsey gifts, dinner, and a cake. about 15 girls showed up and we all had a great time celebrating lauras wedding in a few weeks (they are going on a cruise to get married.we danced all night long until about 2am:):) (late late night lemme tell ya).
Last night there was a death in my family, my Nana's husband Ted.  

We weren't close...  Nana and I aren't particularly close- we're too much alike, and they were the kind of couple who are maybe so close to each other that there just isn't much room for anyone else.  

Ted was loud, overbearing, a know-it-all, bellowing stories and pontifications for anyone who would listen (you could hardly help it), and perhaps most annoyingly, he was prone to correcting pronunciations, vehemently and incorrectly- he had the accent of a New York Taxi driver.  

He was very white...  The kind of well intentioned whiteness that admires and borrows from other cultures as an homage, but can make it feel more like a souvenir, if you know what I mean...  

But Ted was also genuinely interested in the world and foreign cultures, in people...  He absorbed it with delight, and he shared it.  He and Nana traveled the world together.  They saw the Aurora Borealis together!  They kept the local Children's Theater going for years!  They were co-chair people of their little chapter of the AARP for so long that when they had to resign, it was like they were abandoning their personal garden club.    

As I said, they were the kind of couple that left little room for anyone else.  That's it's own kind of wonderful, I think. 

He was a loud, bossy sumbitch, but I never, ever doubted the goodness of his heart, and I'm sorry to see him go.  

But I'm glad he was able to go gently.
Way back in late 2006, when the social Web was just starting and Twitter was but a mere messaging Web site, along MyBlogLog, which gave us the concept of a social Web profile  and creating a community around your Web site.

The idea was a good one, and oh so exploitable by some unseemly social media marketers. And I think one of the better ideas to be popularized by MBL was the idea of the embeddable Web site widget featuring recent MBL visitors to your blog (see lower right hand side of cleverhack for the visitor widget).

Not that long after MBL arrived on the scene, they were acquired by Yahoo and their founders moved from New England to California. Unfortunately, Yahoo didn’t treat MBL all that well and never really improved the service or the MBL UI for that matter. The fact that MBL wasn’t really that integrated with Yahoo didn’t help matters much. And but three years later, we hear that Yahoo will kill MyBlogLog next month.

MyBlogLog - a great idea a little ahead of it’s time and never fully developed into a friendly usable product. I’ll be pouring out a 40 for one of the early pioneers of the social Web.
My birthday seemed to forever continue this year. . . but now things seem to once again be settling down a bit. Thanks to everyone for the calls, the texts, the facebook messages, and the presents. It has been a great week!

On Tuesday night, a group of girls I know through church took me to Red Robin for dinner- YUM! One of my favorite places ever!

On Wednesday, my actual birthday, Mom and Dad had cookies delivered to my school (another YUM). The kids loved it!

That night, my friend Nephi took me to dinner at PF Changs, then on Thursday, my friend Michael took me bowling and to TGI Fridays. (No pictures :( 

On Saturday, for my actual present, Nephi got me tickets to the Travis Tritt concert down at Stateline. 
Upon taking our first picture, he discovered that the recent scratch on his face was noticeable on the picture which he did not like, so we had to take a new one. :-P
I dream of a family too, but I am not going to sit still and make myself less than who God has made me in order to be acceptable. In my own mind, my future goals are simple. I want to go back to Macau- a small place with an incredible amount of life, culture and worlds packed on top of each other. 

I want to work with local Christians to start a "L'Abri" type center for kids at risk, providing counseling, skill training in English and jobs, music and art classes and eventually a live-in center for kids who don't fit in the normal education system. I want to show them that this life is real, the decisions they make are real; that there is more to this life than money. I want to show them that this reality is Jesus. I want to spend my life among these people, not as a leader but as a representative of Jesus; as a friend. I want to do this not for the response that I may get but because an act of love; of incarnation is always valuable. I want to live upstairs in this center and grow flowers with my husband who does whatever job glorifies God and makes him happy and who also is committed to incarnational living. My mom will be happy to know that I do hope to give her grandchildren...someday. When I retire, I want to run a flower shop with Tina Cheong.

What's special about this? I think it's just the location...or maybe it should be only the location. 

But being in my hometown inevitably makes me feel strange. The things that I have achieved, the friends that know me best, the goals that I have given myself to since graduating from highschool are not represented here. I would like to face something that I have always tried to ignore: I am an outsider here. Maybe if I had gone to Hart or Shelby High I would have enough warm memories of the past to tie me together with people that I grew up with. 

Maybe if I had learned earlier that spirituality has a lot to do with laughter I would have made bridges with friends from highschool. I spoke too much truth without dancing; made goals without warmth.  People here have always been good to me, but sometimes I wonder if that is because they like me or because they are trying to do the "right" thing. It is an interesting cycle that many people my age left Hart for a while only to return when they married and had families. This is a good place for stable people. Maybe I am not stable enough yet. I am too idealistic. I am too passionate. If I care about something I can't laugh it off. Perhaps I am perceived as a ballastic missile fallen in a farmer's field. Mabye if I was a guy my gifts would make more sense to people here. Maybe I think too much.

 I am a white person who sometimes thinks in Chinese, I am an evangelical Christian who is not Republican. I believe in committment and loyalty but I have moved at least 8 times in 5 years. 

The problem is that I care too much. I don't think I will ever be able to give up trying, and I can't just say the way I think is my neurosis and move on. I can't turn my back on this place because I don't think that is the right thing to do. I am not someone who doesn't care how many people dislike them. I am an idealist. I think things can always be better. People can always change. A crippled relationship is better than a cut-off relationship because there is still chance for improvement. But this also means that there might be infection and no healing.

Is this idealism or addiction?
Today I feel like I have a lot of time on my hands, even though I am watching one more child today for a total of 3 under 3, not so bad they are all mostly good as long as they are fed and rested that is.

So why is it that I feel bored? I cleaned the house yesterday...so not much to do there...I did laundry on Tuesday and Wednesday so only one load today...oh wait there is clothes to put away in the boys's room (dang). Maybe I am bored because I am procrastination making more cotton cloths and dryer balls? Well I don't want to get too crazy with those, if I don't sell more pretty soon I am going to have a laundry room full of balls...at least my clothes will get dry in a jiffy!

So...I decided this morning that I would make a good dinner, you know the works, home made bread, salad, sides and main dish...well since then I've made a couple crocheted cloths, 3 facial cloths, 2 dryer balls...I've even watched some TV (which I hardly ever do!) I guess I really don't want to make dinner. I just don't know what to make. It seems like I make the same thing over and over again, stuck in a rut. I've looked for other things to make but they all seem like the same thing... tweaked a bit. Hmmm...I think I'll go crochet some more and worry about the food later...

Happy afternoon everyone!
My name is Lala Ema. I’m French with Malagasy origins. I was born and raised in Aix-en-Provence then lived in Paris until I moved to the south of Granada in Andalucia (Spain). I love this city and although I sometimes miss the buzz of the city life and my dear old Paris, my heart is taken for ever by Andalucia and my Spanish boyfriend.I'm a designer and recently started an activity as a wedding planner in Granada.
A waiter-sommelier appeared to allow us to consider our tea choices, elucidating each one with well-rehearsed morsels of syntax, designed to tantalise and tempt. Having tremulously made our choices after parsing his foreign syllables with difficulty, we sat quietly and waited for something to happen.

With a few minutes we were poured our tea in china teacups and we began to feel infinitely more relaxed; quite a few people in the neighbouring tables were Just Like Us and the only silver spoon to be found was jostling in the saucer with the teacup, and certainly not in one of the patrons' mouths.In a rather ungenteel manner, we demolished the sandwiches as soon as they arrived, so sadly there are no pictures of our delicious tidbits-crusts-cut-off-thank-you-very-much. Our favourite was the smoked salmon and wasabi, delicious with a waspish sting. Next came the pastries expertly arranged on a tiered stand by a wind-up toy of a waiter who'd clearly served over-excited childish adults with chocolate smeared around their mouths before.

...And so mindful were we of that tiny silver spoon and how one must stir their tea gently so as not to chink the sides of one's cup. And to expertly steer conversation clear of politics or money, and to keep said conversation no louder than the chink of the china we were eating from.
I arrived in Israel exactly a week ago and haven't been able to find enough time to sit at a computer or upload my photos. 
I spent my first two days with family (grandparents, uncles aunts and cousins) in Tel Aviv. 

Then I went off on a 2 day seminar in Jerusalem to prepare for my internship. All in all, those 2 days were mostly spent on touring Jerusalem and the old city. I felt like being on Birthright-Taglit again. A group of about 40 people from all over the world gathered to prepare for their next 2 months in Israel by learning about political issues, examining cultural differences, and learning about the Israeli workplace. 

We toured Jerusalem in the old city and City of David. Jerusalem used to be completely religious. Today it is a mix of everything, but still keeping it's religious history, and marking it's name as the "holy city" for many religions. It's divided into four sections of Jews, Muslims, Christians, and Armenians. 
I spent time on Ben-Yehuda street, a touristy spot with lots of restaurants, shops, and local music. The next day I went to the Western Wall (for the millionth time). We happened to go on a Thursday when lots of Bar-Mitzvahs were going on so it was very busy. It is common to write a note with a prayer or a wish and place it inside the blocks of the kotel (the Western Wall). Every time I go there I get annoyed that the wall is separated by men and women, yet he women's side is about half the size of the men's. I also tend to forget about small traditions in the kotel such as walking backwards as you leave the wall so you can face god.
Well, It's Monday and I'M NOT AT WORK. Because I'm 24 and still observe spring break. No, I'm out of school. But that's just how I roll. Yesterday was one of my favorite obscure holidays: Pi Day; second only to National Talk Like a Pirate Day.

I'm about to clean out 6 boxes of old items from my past. I'm sure it will be thought provoking. Thoughts mainly like "what the hell was I thinking on that??" "When/WHY did I ever wear that??" Hindsight is 20/20. I wish foresight was. There is probably more to come on this particular topic. This will probably be a day with two postings. But foresight is not 20/20. It is not even a real word. So stay tuned. I know you are on the edge of your seat regarding the question of the day: What do the boxes in my mom's den contain from my glorious high school days??
Recently, I had a conversation with someone about what I'm doing with my life. They said to me, "You know Rebekah, you've never gotten over the 'when I grow up' mentality. Just do something radical." I looked at them questioningly, thinking to myself, Yeah, easier said than done.
But then I got to thinking. I've been mulling over this statement "just do something radical" for over a week now. And last night, something popped into my head that made me stop, and contemplate. What if doing something radical with my life doesn't necessarily mean doing something that's going to change the course of history, or the ways of a culture? What if, in my life, doing something radical simply means to do something with my life I've never thought I was capable of before? What if I'm not meant to change the world, but simply to change my own world, the world I can immediately impact? Does doing something radical have to be a huge gesture that hundreds or thousands will notice, or can it simply be something small, something many other people give no thought to, but something that is a huge step to me?
What if doing something radical means to fulfill the plan God has for me, however simple it may be, even if it's not glamorous or impressive?
Every Valentine's Day I am alone.  
Alone.
Yeah, let that sink in. Feel the weight of it....

Now that you sufficiently feel bad for me, and want to lavish me with words of adoration, dozens of roses, and diamonds (they are a girl's best friend), I will ask you to hold all tokens of affection because I already have more than a gal could ever ask..... I have you. Yes, You. 

I have all of you wonderful readers and people to read. You allow me into your minds and your hearts; soooo many interesting places. I also have me. Me is pretty awesome, so why should I bemoan this wretched day? I know, it's insanity.... I'm far too amazing to spend hating one day of the year. So, I decided that this year, I am my own Valentine and I have also picked from some of the awesomeness on here to be my Valentine's as well. Strictly singles though. Yes, I do <3 many on here who are married, but this one day of the year married already have what we single are possibly searching for, so I must withhold my love for this single day. Forgive me marries. 

Tomorrow if the weather permits, and I pray it does, I'll be getting two more tattoos as my Valentine's/100 lbs lost gift to myself. And, my suggestion is that all of us do something nice for ourselves. We deserve it.
Now on to my Valentine's. A collection of awesomeness that defies the laws of gravity, or is that the laws of attraction? Either way, go to these people and shower them with the love and worship they deserve.
This beautiful, bright, bold woman needs little introduction
Ms Marissa is one of the most amazing women that I have had the pleasure of meeting on MySpace.
I can't even imagine how many hours we've spent shooting the shit in my box at all hours of the day and night.
Jessie and I were talking today about how much we love Rissa. 
Jessie suggested that we all get together to show her how much she means to us all!
Following the death of the world's last Bo speaker (picture courtesy of BBC News) at the start of the month, the blogosphere was inundated with comments, questions and arguments about the importance of minority languages. To my dismay, a lot of people (many of whom seemed to hail from deepest inland US of A) seemed to think that language is nothing more than a method of communication. That the fewer languages the better. That, seeing as language is nothing more than a form of communication, why can't everybody just speak English?

As a linguist (albeit a poor one) I was saddened by these sorts of views. To reduce  language to the mere some of its parts, to a collection of words used to indicate something is to discount the awesome development of humankind. At the basest level of argument, language is what differentiates us from animals. At the highest, according to Jean-Jacques (not Henri) Rousseau, from its first moments of existence language has been the downfall of humanity from a pure and natural state and has a lot to bloody well answer for.
Ok, so I am not really creative. In the writing sense. Currently I have been puzzled with an assignment for my Intro to Theater. The project is to write a final scene. RIGHT... Well, I have a thought, that is I am DEAD. Not really. I have been thinking about this assignment for a while now, and I think I have finally figured it out. I am now in the process of thinking. =) My thought is to write a very simple story line. The setting is a coffee shop. You have two friends who haven't seen each other in four years. While they are talking they become distracted with all of these different costumers in the coffee shop... and that is as far as I have made it. I only have until Monday to write this fine piece of art. For it is due on Tuesday!!! I am in search of my creative self!
Each morning, I pack up all my stuff for work and leave it by the door, before heading out for a little walk with the puppy. Then I can come home and just grab my stuff, change my shoes (which have also been left by the door), and head out! I'm a girl that tries to get as much sleep as possible, therefore, little morning time is wasted from my wake up, til me being out that door. 

Today the puppy was antsy, or I dont know, maybe I was antsy, so we skipped pack up time, and headed out on our walk a little prior to schedule. Then when I got home, I had to run around like a crazy girl trying to get myself out the door by my usual time. About half way through my 20-25 minute trek to work I was chatting on the phone, and I looked down to my feet. And this is what I saw. . .

Totally forgot to change my shoes!! Agh!! Can I BE wearing a more unprofessional pair of shoes??

Risk it and head to walmart hoping to find a decent pair of black shoes that I could pass off for the day? Or just head home now and be a few minutes tardy to work? 
I decided to head home. . . what if Walmart didn't have ANYTHING? Then I would have wasted valuable time and still had to have gone home!

Luckily, I usually try to do more of my planning stuff before school rather than after, so I am typically an early arriver. That meant that with today's little catastrophe, I was only a couple of minutes late. PHEW! Better that then be walking around in complete humiliation with pink fuzzy crocs on my feet all day long!

Can't WAIT til I am living closer to work!
i'm incredibly lonely, go figure.

the past year i've spent with you my one and only, fuck. you're still my one and only. so many empty promises left unkept, i don't know how to react.

i'm so unstable, every other minute i'm biting my lip trying to hold back tears. everything doesn't seem to be getting better like everyone's promised.

i'm spending christmas alone. i'm spending my mornings, afternoons, and nights alone. i crave being held, i crave being loved. i crave being the first priority, the first one thought about, the only one wanted.
always second best, seems that's all i will ever be.

i drift through, day by day. trying to see a point in getting ready and standing up for the day. i don't see me having a future, it seems like there's some mental block keeping me from looking forward.

why is it, that no matter who i get close to, there will always be someone better, and more worthy of they're time, energy, and thoughts? am i really just worth that little, that not one person would put me as first?

'no, it's sarah. it's okay to shove her aside. she'll still be around. i can't say no to the other person, because if i do they'll walk away. but sarah, she'll never leave no matter what i do.'

people know i'll stick around no matter how i'm treated, everybody tells me that. they tell me they don't mean for me to end up as their punching bag, but that they need to let it out somehow, and that they know i'll be around regardless. and that i'm 'strong enough' to take it. it rips me apart. maybe i just care more than they do.
maybe i'm just not strong enough to walk away.
A couple of weeks ago, I had what can only be described as a serendipitous beauty moment; a happy accident predicated upon both my own chronic forgetfulness and sore, sea-whipped lips caused by an hour or two on the British coastline. Generally speaking, I like to leave the house looking as put-together as I can be: my clothes are ironed and donned following at least half an hour of indecisive dithering (more if I'm having a fat day); my hair is suitably coiffed and fluffed; my liquid eyeliner is flicked and even and there's often a lash of scarlet across my lips.

Although my morning routine may seem lengthy and labour-intensive, I count myself as a lazy girl when it comes to beauty: I never under any circumstances powder my nose, touch up my eyes or trowel anything else onto my face, except for my lips. I make the extra effort in the morning and it makes me feel good about myself; I bounce and strut out of the house, confident in the knowledge that all I need in my makeup bag I carry with me is a lipstick and a lip balm. Sometimes there's a gloss, but I'm fickle about those.

So on one particularly inauspicious day, I was sitting on the train bopping to... oh, I don't know... David Bowie or something, and then, as the train chugged its dull way out of the station, I realised I'd forgotten my precious makeup bag. I had no lipstick, no back-up lipstick; not even a smidge of Carmex.

Being the sensitive sort about the relative pallor of my lips without their swipe of lovely red, I hastened to Superdrug to find something to salvage my now sea-sore lips that had a little bit of colour.

Maybelline left me cold; all the 'do-able' shades were either sold or tampered with, and it was the same with Bourjois. I live in a town where grubby hands like to paw at the cosmetic displays, it seems. Resigning myself to buying a very cheap and nasty lipgloss from a brand whose name I can't even remember, I wandered past the Sleek display (yes, this post does have a point) and stopped because something caught my eye: the Sleek Pout Polish.
the job entails responsibility, sacrifice and phenomenal communication skills. Being a leader comes in handy from life's smallest events, from organizing playground games in elementary school, to grand events when you're older. Some people are natural leaders, some are quiet, wise leaders, some are charismatic and others have the ability to persuade and lead people. However, these characteristics aside, I think what sets apart a good leader from a great one is vision.
Heads up all my lovelies... I have made a slight change to the setting of my blog - before your comments are posted I will be reviewing them.  In the last couple of weeks I have received some odd, random and illegible comments.  

No offense to anyone, but I don't want links to questionable sites showing up mixed in with all my lovely comments from friends, followers and legitimate visitors.  

I don't mind people expressing their opinions about my writing - I love the dialog... but when those who are obviously phishing for their sites leave bogus comments, I just get plain pissed off.



I spent time with my little art buddies this afternoon - they just have so much fun.  I showed them how to make silhouettes by cutting out this model from a catalog and painting around her.  Then she got passed around and ended up in three journals - they thought it was soooo coooool!!
Friends hereabouts are starting to email out pictures of their 2010 crop of foals.  That's Miniature horse foals.  Most of the pictures show the newborn in the arms of their new owners (the owners standing, holding the foals like newborn puppies.) Since a Miniature horse foal is about twenty pounds and seventeen inches tall or so.

Miniature horses don't know they're little, just as Chihuahuas don't know they're no bigger than the squirrels they chase. My main man, a stallion named Fyr, is a wild and fierce as a Montana mustang, and he's a whopping thirty inches tall, full grown. We're coming into another Spring breeding season, and as the mares start to think about being receptive, Fyr snorts and prances and is READY to do battle with anything or anyone that gets between him and the loves of his life.

I have another stallion, Talisman. One day, unthinking me, left the wrong gate open, and both stallions jump-started out into the main psture. All those 'wimmin' and two stallions; and the war was one. Screaming in rage, rearing pawing the dirt, twisting their heads in that way stallions have, and shouting obscenities at each other. They dug in like two drivers about to play "chicken" and charged.

It was a wild battle. The mares looked and gathered close (no doubt gossiping about which 'hunk' appealed to them most.) The stallions screamed and lashed out at each other, and bit and tumbled and, it was most ferocious. Dirt flew, bits of horse hair were spat out, the barn cats raced to higher ground, the barn roof, to watch.

I finally decided I had to brave the flying hooves and lunging teeth, waded in and grabbed each halter. "Knock it off, you guys." It was like breaking up a battle between two four year old kids.

I got them separated and put back where each belonged. There they were, safely in their own paddocks again. Pacing the fence, screaming at each other, "wait 'till next time, dude."

The mares wandered away, probably disappointed.
I always pictured life like the movies. But i have realized that movies are not the source. They are unrealistic and dreamable. I wish that life were like the movies because there is always a happy ending! (sometimes). All the best movies are the ones that are realistic like Juno and all the ones that are based on true storys. hehe
I believe that life can be like movies. It's rare but it can be the same.Waiting with Angela

Just siting here waiting for my tutor to come. today is a short day in school and My tutor doesn't know that. So i have to wait another 10 minutes for his arrival. hehe. I had tutoring with him with just me but now Angela is joining in. Shes in Geometry im in algebra. I know. How is that gonna work out? Well i guess he can multi task. Thats good. Because now i have more time to do problems without half pressure.
And all I can say is Thank You, Thank You!!!  
We thought we were looking at having another surgical procedure yesterday, so the boy got doped up before we saw the surgeon and he said "Nope, let's just wait a bit longer and see what happens.  It's healing so nicely I just don't want to cut him again"  Relief all around!!  So, we came home and set up his new computer, cleaned his room, I cleaned mine, sprayed bleach all over the tub - again, and I finally got all the laundry caught up.

I was standing over him as he was doing something on the computer and he looked up at me and I said "Do you know how much I love you?"  and he said "A lot, I know Mom.  I love you too."


This month's Tip-In Swap on BAJ was about Love - what kind of love makes your heart go all warm and fuzzy.  Mine is about Mother Love and it will go out in the mail tomorrow to Stacy  Here is what it looks like...
This is the story behind it is - I was at an estate sale a few weeks back and I saw this lonely little, beat up quilt hanging over the railing in the attic.  I picked it up and thought how sweet - it had little Sun Bonnet Sue's all over.  It was only $1 and I was debating - do I really need another thing to add to my collection of "junk"?  This woman was watching me and she said "That was well loved, wasn't it?"  I agreed and that was it - it came home with me.  As I was paying I saw this old office name plate for a desk, with the name of the woman who's things they were selling.  Turns out she is a lady who once attended my church.  She is now in an assisted-living home as she is almost ninety and very frail.  Next time I see her daughter I will let her know that I bought the quilt that was most likely hers and I am including it in my art - so it will live on in a variety of ways :-))


All for today my lovelies...
Well, first up, HELLO WORLD! haha!
I never thought i would be one of those people to "blog", but here I am and it will mostly be about the goings-on in my television career here in the United States.
I will be posting links, videos, photos and try to reach as many people as possibly, for I am a woman on a mission: To host the brand new X Factor that will be airing on Fox in the fall of 2011. Simon Cowell is leaving American Idol this year, and will be bringing the new generation talent-show juggernaut that is X Factor, to the US!
I know it is over a year away, but that gives me more time to create and spread as MUCH hype as possibly, because isn't that what this little world wide web is for?!
Make sure to check out my myspace and you can see some of the awesome TV work I have been lucky enough to be involved in, as well as a few videos: www.myspace.com/ashakwork

Welcome to my review of the above product. I hope this helps someone out there. 

First of all, this product's name is way too long. However, in its defense, it is in no way a marketing ploy and is pretty spot-on about what it does. For example, a "spot corrector" could be a great concealer, a pimple buster, a bleaching agent, some to remove unsightly blood stains with, a dog-killing agent (but only for dogs names "spot") etc. But no, this product is an Overnight Whitening Peeling Cream.
Are there levels of disappointment? Sometimes people just generally fail to live up to your expectations. And sometimes, betray, lies and disappoint, I know. But what about the time when there is no coming back from it? Like all the trust, respect and love you had for the person looks so minute and meagre when weighed against the disappointment? Can you ever get over it? 'To forgive is divine' they say. But can there be a time when it's not in your capacity to forgive anymore? What if I have to shut things/people out in order to grow, in order to shun something I've been so used to, because it's doing nothing but sucking the life out of you?

Sigh. I hate change. How do I get over something I've been so used to? Somehow I had made peace with the regular disappointments. But there is a line you just don't cross, right? You have to stop letting yourself be used and stop throwing yourself out there somehow, no matter how strong it needs you to be. Argh. I need strength. Anyone selling any?
I have come to realise that Americans, or at least all the college students where I live, will find any reason in the world to get drunk. From football games to award shows...we have even know taken it to the new level of using other country's traditions in holidays to have a reason to "get crunk." this came to my attention really clearly the past few days...
1) while listening to the radio on the way to work each morning, I have heard an advertisement for Universal Studios, and many other places, mardi gras parties....before feb 17 (ash wednesday, the day lent begins) I was like "ah tight yeah that could be fun!" now, one month past ash wednesday i am thinking...WHAT THE HECK. a quick explanation to the world mardi gras is french for "fat tuesday" it was a tradition the french began to binge on their last day of freedom before lent begins...not the tuesday and monday before, not the weekend before and the monday and the tuesday... just the tuesday hence it only naming tuesday....it's whatever if as americans we feel the need to have it start a little early because really who can afford to party on the tuesday with work/school. but having mardi gras celebrations a month after is a bit too tacky for me.
2) tomorrow is st. patricks day. i so far, since i woke up this morning have been invited to 5 st. pattys day parties....that begin TONIGHT...now dont get me wrong, i'm always down for a good irish shin dig (seeing as i am 50% irish 50% scottish)...but preferably i'd life to party on the day the party is supposed to be held. all this "lets go get drunk to go get banded tonight so we can get drunk tomorrow" is WAY beyond me...and just so the world knows, st. particks day began as a feast (not drinking binge) to celebrate st. patrick the patroned saint of ireland....so its a christian holiday that has obviously become secularized.

so americans....lets come out of the closet...admit you are all alcoholics or budding alcoholics or wanna be alcoholics....instead of ruining other countries traditions..i'm not sayin, but im just sayin..
Well things are going very well here with my sis! I am VERY Pleasantly SURPRISED!! Bobbi is trying so hard and is really getting out there and is making some AWESOME progress!

We have decided that She will defiantly be on my Show!! That is if the judge allows it!! I see it as her ONLY Hope!! Since our country cant figure out how to care for its people properly!! Grrrrr!

She WANTS To go to treatment and No insurance!!! HELLO OBAMA!! Start acting like you care about us like ALL of the other countries do!!!

Thank You all For your prayers!! There working! ~~HUGS~~
I was blessed with two children with two very different personalities. La, who my oldest, is sweet, sensitive, high maintenance, and bursting with energy (ALL the time). KiKi, the younger one is laid back, kind, pensive, and very generous. The both have qualities that I love in small children. They are not perfect either. Sometimes they have me so frustrated that I want to pull my hair out in clumps. 

There are also moments that I have, like today, where my heart wants to burst of my chest with the amount of pride I feel for my child. This morning I was dropping of KiKi at her nursery school on my way to church. The teacher was in the class buzzing about, greeting children, diffusing the small problems that each child had. Normal morning there. Then she stopped, turned to me and said "I just want to let you know what a joy it is to have KiKi in class. She is such a sweet child. She is so laid back and she shares with everyone. I just wanted you to know that."

It is just so nice to hear someone say that about your child. 

This afternoon I have LaLa's parent consultation. Let's hope I get that feeling twice in one day. Cross your fingers, toes and touch wood.
So I had another odd dream.....

I enter some unknown town and am waiting in line with my mom.  This kid says to me "what are you doing here?"  Then I look up and my brother also says "aren't you banned from here?"
My mom responds saying "She's invited by me so she has permission to be here"
I turn and see my step dad coming down the escalator and I kiss my mom on her cheek and say "thanks, but I'll be right back"
As my step dad turns to me I go out the door and into my car as the rest of his party begins to chit chat w/him.
For the first time my mom defends me, it's in a dream.  How likely.This is a good story and is true, please read it all the way through until the end!
I am a mother of three (ages 14, 12, 3) and have recently completed my college degree.
The last class I had to take was Sociology.
The teacher was absolutely inspiring with the qualities that I wish every human being had been graced with.
Her last project of the term was called, 'Smile.'
The class was asked to go out and smile at three people and document their reactions.
I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake,
literally.
"I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life in which he has imagines, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.  He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higer order of beings.  In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness.  If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them."
Hello, dear blog, you must be feeling lonely.  I have been in this place between working like a dog and worrying like my mother.  It's a very uncomfortable place, leaving little room for words or tranquil thoughts.   Working has been good in a sense - people are having babies again, which directly correlates with my paycheck.  And worrying has been related to our accepted offer on a house.  It's a good thing, really.  Right?  Oh the unanswered questions.

But I have had other thoughts admist the work and worry.  I've had a few very hippy, grass-roots, patients that I spent hours conversing with over the last few days.  My patient last night talked with me about life without television or news, just novels and music, and how empowering it is.  My coworkers of course laughed at her - but I was secretely inspired.  I love to read, and lord knows I would read and write more if there wasn't a tv constantly blaring.  Oh how I miss writing.  I used to write like my life depended on it.  I remember being eighteen years old & the incredibly close relationship I had with my creative writing & poetry teacher - she enscribed 'Never stop writing - it will kill you' on my notebook the last day of class.  And I do feel a bit empty in a sense.  I started this blog to write, yet the inspiration wasn't there. 

So, a big thank you to my patient, Tori Amos (my current nostalgic as ever playlist), and miss Emily B.  I have been reminded of inspiration.  I will take the time to read more novels and turn off that idiot box of mine (baby steps, of course).  I will remember what is real and important, and I will write.
I began this new decade with a three day cleansing fast of just water and tea. I used to fast regularly and was always amazed at how full I could feel from being empty.

I used to suffer from immobilizing panic attacks. In retrospect, most of them were due to alcohol and/or xanax withdrawal, both of which I abused for most of my life, but I still sometimes get them. I haven't had one panic attack in three weeks, in spite of some heavy duty real life challenges.

I think it is because the fast, as short as it was, put things in perspective. On the second day I was miserable and my ego was screaming at me to stop it.
One of the problems (admittedly, a lesser one) about being alone is that there is no one to vouch for you when you claim that every single time you get in a check-out line the person ahead of you runs into some sort of major glitch. 

It's still true, but I've got no back-up. Kyle never ever got into the same checkout line as I did. And generally, by the time I got out of the store, he'd have the truck warmed up and waiting for me at the exit. 

Now, where was I setting off to go?

Oh right. 1958. I know, most of you weren't born, but that means you certainly didn't have Mrs. Banks for home room, and that's a good thing. 
Mrs Banks was a huge bitch. Reminiscent of someone I met here on MySpace.

At any rate, that year someone new transferred to my junior high, and we quickly became friends. Her family lived in an great old antebellum house with interesting nuances like a back stairway for servants (and used by the youngest child in family when I knew them), and a button under the dining room table to step on to call the maid...of course no one appeared, but it was a neat idea.

My favourite part, though, was the fact that the front hallway telephone could be taken into the coat closet through a hole in the wall. Making it possible to talk while IN the closet. How avant guarde was that? Seemed like the height of telephone sophistication to us.

This morning my SKYPE "phone" rang, and there was my old friend, looking slightly rumpled in her bathrobe. She said, "I can't see you. Can you see me?" I said yes, but I'm not yet ready for early morning video calls. Maybe in another 52 years.
OK.. So I came down to flordia to finially meet Nikki Wodrich who I have been talking online for 6 years. I came down here to hang out with her and and girlfriend Tina. So I get here and I end up sitting at there "daughter" Roo's girlfriends house the whole week. Next week I spend more time with Nikki's daughter then her. Nikki, promised sooo many times we'd go out and do things. And she lied every single time.. Some excuse after another came up. I had her pictured as this completely different person. She lies about everything. She even mooches off her own daughter and her daughter's girlfriend. To the point that her own daughter can't stand living with her. Nikki and Tina are getting kicked out because Roo and her girlfriend can't stand there asses anymore. They don't pay their bills haven’t paid rent since January. She's a lazy bitch that won't get off her fat ass and get a job. As for tina that bitches barely works. Don’t pay bills.. I just can't believe I wasted my time and money on these cuts. Seriously, this trip was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I really wish I would have not ever started talking with nikki since the last time she became two-faced. Funny, how everyone that told me shit about her came true. She's selfish, Only cares about herself. Shit she proved that when she was bragging about cheating on tina. I thought that was kinda funny.. and yet she had the balls to tell me that tina was on a two week probation and that she doesn’t want to be with her anymore.. She only keeps tina around because tina FINALLY has a car and job. Which nikki had neither. She’s mooching off everyone she knows. It’s pretty fucking sad... she really needs to grow the fuck up. I just seriously can't believe that every single person I talked to about nikki told me the truth. After 6 years you think you know a person. Nope, I was wrong. Sad thing is that I started to see all this the 2nd day I was here. But, that’s okay. She’s no longer my friend. I don't want anything to do with these bitches ever again. as far as I am concerned they can fall off the face of the earth. I hope tina's car breaks down...I really believe they blew me off because I don't start drama, and I don't make nikki cheat on tina. That’s funny but whatever. Fuck it. No sweat off my nuts.. I hate this bitch... just goes to show don’t trust anyone who don't know.
To take another pill, or to sleep?
It reminds me of all those extremely stressful moments, when I have to solve the last question of the last problem in a math test with only ten more minutes left. That's the exact moment testing what kind of person you choose to be. Whether hold on the faith to work it out and make yourself outstanding, or give in with the long-lasting regret and admit you're no more than ordinary. I believe it is the experience of sticking to the belief for oneself and walking through the breathtaking moments that make a person into a much stronger one. Even if s/he fail in the end. And a lifelong self-confidence was also established in such a cruel way.
 
So please hold on one more time and work it out. Don't make an easier choice.
Austin is 6 months already! I can't believe how quickly he is growing up! Now I can't imagine life without him. He is such a blessing to us and we just love him so much. Here are some of the things Austin has been doing lately: 
-On our last day in Texas over the holidays, Austin rolled over! Now he is a rolling machine. Only he won't do it on command. 
-He loves to laugh and coo all the time. 
-He is going through a rough phase with sleeping during the night but hopefully it will pass soon. 
-Austin loves books and he tries to read them to me now whenever I pull them out. It's so cute! 
-He weighs about 18 pounds.
-Does not enjoy bath time.
-His new trick is spitting and he thinks it's really funny.
-He is getting so good at grabbing and playing with toys.
-We have started him on eating cereal. He hasn't quite got the hang of it yet.
-He has been teething but no teeth have come through yet.
-He loves being out and about and seeing new things.
-He loves music and songs especially if they have actions to go along with them.
My mum bought me this lovely swirly mug for christmas. If I look at it in the light the colours on it are a creamy-rose and a faded green. But in the dark all these wonderful yellow stripes shine off it. I think it's a magical cup - oh and the pattern on it is very interesting. It's fun to watch out of the corner of my eye: if I look at it straight on it just seems to be a ordinary swirly cup, but when I'm not looking the spirals winding around it move and I sometimes forget it's not really spinning. Perhaps it is and I'm just not supposed to see... I think I'll buy another one if I ever see them. I'm excited now: it'll look so pretty when I'm writing and my two mugs just spin around on the table next to me. I won't fill them right up though: I'll just make my drink in one then pour half into the other. It'll mean twice the washing up but that's not so bad.

We've just bought a new washing-up liquid that smells so sweet, it's like a lemon, apple, and grape tree have been bred together and this smell is their new fruit. It all works though: when I close my eyes I can pretend I'm far away from England. Sometimes I wind up in Greece, sometimes in Italy and sometimes places I've never even heard of. All these wonderful places a lot of people might never get to see. If I could I'd take everyone on holiday: but alas I'm not so rich and there are far too many people. That's why this new liquid is really lovely to use, it's almost enough to just pretend I'm somewhere else. I hope they make a new smell soon, I think the dishes prefer this one too: they seem to sparkle with happiness when I've done them. So yes, I shall buy another mug. I just hope it likes the washing up liquid as much as his partner does.

My new mug swirls a lot in the water, the bubbles look like they can't stay on top of it. They keep trying to climb their way to the top but it just wipes them away again. Like when kids play in the funhouses, I remember there were these huge, cylinder rotating things and it was always a competition to see which one of us could stay on the longest. It was usually a boy with really long legs that he could wrap around the rotating thing. Everyone else would throw the coloured balls from the ball pit at him, trying to knock him off. But those balls weren't really that bad when they were threw, so he usually stayed on for a really long time, until he got tired of course, or until the bell rang for all the children with 'blue' stickers to come out because their fun time was up. But when I'm washing up, none of the bubbles can stay on the mug as long as the children in the funhouse used to. I think it's because they're so wet and slippery. Like a dolphin. I like dolphins.. no I'm lying.. I love them. No-one but me will ever understand why, and that's just how I want it to be.
I wish I could say I'm strong, but I'm not. I wish I could say I can endure this, but I can't. I wish I could continue to keep my positive "glass is half full" attitude, but I don't think I can. While I've learned I cannot endure this without Him, I continue to wonder, when is it going to stop? Where is my reward for bearing with this and being so patient? Then I remember there might not be one, not on this earth. But I need to embrace and accept that. That the reward I'm waiting for is in heaven, greater than any reward I could possibly hope to receive on this earth.
Two of my greatest heroes are probably Betsy Ten Boom and Regina Lago. I had the honor and privilege of knowing the latter. She was beautiful in every way. God took her home a few years ago when she died from a brain tumor [pretty sure that's it...]. She was strong and faithful throughout her suffering, and in the end, her reward was going home to Christ. Same as Betsy. Even though she was put in a concentration camp, she remained unswervingly devoted to Christ, whom she knew was much greater than what she was going through.
I visited my bestbestbestest friends at Kibbutz Hazorea this weekend. Most of my girlfriends (have to emphasize the girl part) embarked on a program after high school called Garin Tzabar. In this program, they were able to make Aliyah on their own with a community of same-aged peers who want to serve in the Israeli Defense Forces. The program provides them housing, adopted families, and certain privileges that regular Israeli soldiers wouldn't be able to obtain. 
All of this is possible when residing on a kibbutz. A kibbutz, in the old days, used to be a socialist community where families live together, work in the same field (i.e farming, agriculture), and would get back the same necessities as everyone such as housing and food.
Things have changed since those days, although a lot of main kibbutz characteristics have remained. The cows, the chicken, the food production, and the main community dining room have remained. It was really nice having dinner and breakfast with the entire community of babies, children, working adults, and elderly that all live in this town-like place which serves the same foods.
..I can't believe I am going to do this. I am doing the thing I make fun of other people for doing. I am making a good-bye MySpace blog.

I know!

I was just going to delete my profile without a word, but that just seemed so cold.  I can't just fade away because I can't quit you people. (of course I mean you blacks)

I have fun here. I may have fake profiles, but my connections to people are as real as they are in the real world.

Am I just doing this for attention? Of course!

I mean it too, though.

I will continue to watch over all via God Smith, (he sees all, even when you are masturbating), but I am done living my life so "out loud" for the world to see and I am done with this profile. When I come back, (and you know I will) it will be from a different profile.

Take care of yourselves, MySpace- and each other.

P.S.

I do so love you miserable bastards.
Over the past week, I have done a couple of really interesting interviews for the book. 

Michael, an old friend of Mike's, told me about some of the Rose Tattoo days - and about an incident with Dit and Der. (They published a fanzine in the 80s.) If anyone knows their real name (or how to find them) I would love to hear about it.

I also spoke with Veronica, an ex-girlfriend of Mike's. She was very open and talked with me for hours. Her recollection of their time together will make for some great stories too. 

The more I get into this project, the more I have come to respect the people involved. I had no idea that I would learn so much - not just about the underground scene in New Orleans, but about the power of the human spirit in all of us - no matter what we have been through.
Upon searching through a very commonly used website, I found a quote that really stuck out today. It stated "She is my rock, my inspiration. Though impossible to define in just one word, she is my sister". This quote seems to be the only thing that I can possibly relate to lately. Every relationship I have been in has had it's ups and downs, it's faults and it's breaking points. But the relationships that truly stand out, the ones that will stick with me for the rest of my life, are the ones that I like to categorize as my sisterhood. I'm proud to say I have three sisters.

I was born one of three daughters, the youngest unfortunately. Not only did my birth order usually cause trouble in my household, but also the circumstances that brought me to today have effected the relationships I have with my sisters. We fight, like many women do, and up until recently I would have to be honest in saying there were times when we had to be ripped away from each other for the fear that one of us would kill the other. But we also laugh. Laughter is the one thing that I know I can count on to fill the halls of this house that up until recently were very silent.

Through the hard times the three of us have faced, we have all dealt with life in a different way. But when push comes to shove and all the superficial bullshit is pushed aside, the only place we want to be is sitting in a car, drinking some coffee, and talking about our problems.
The word that most of the people love the most and then get tired of it easily, 'forever'. Lovers existing in the poems still live with it, withstanding all the grimaces and graces. It exists in the politicians' vows, the mother's bonds, a friend's talks(how much ever fair weathered that friend is). It exists in the minds of the ladies who want their "perfect-est" guy. And according to a friend of mine, he says that all the female fraternity existing on the mother earth who believe in the fairy tales of the brave knight in shining armour or some macho hunk from the moon's chunk (reminds me of Goku from DBZ, don't know why) existing for them, should be given a whiff of reality. (I can hear: Take me down to the paradise city....where the grass is green and the men are hunky...oh won't you please take me hooouoome yeah yeh yeaaaaah....sigh. GnR. Sorry. A lapse of insanity. No meaning whatsoever). It exists in every relation's start and hides in a veil of decay after that, most of the times.


That word never does any justice to all, but seems to hide within it some strange magnet which every one craves for. All those promises, dreams. Like that song of oasis (song: little by little) says,


"dream our dreams alone with no resistance....

fading like the stars we wish to be."


Yes, forever fades away, too. And we see it. We live with that fact every day. Struggle to get a tiny part of that forever, to seek constancy in everything that we do. We don't like twists and changes thrown on our face every day of our life, we wish to do it at our pace. There are relations which you feel you always could keep them the same way, the way they are right now. Even after fights and disputes, we wish to seek the smiles on the same faces every single day of our life and without them, life goes a complete wreck. We seek "forever". But it's so futile, it's tragic. And sometimes, we fear the same tragic blow hitting us again and again in our life. But still, like a courageous (but scared within like crap) soldier, we march on towards the same old pits.
Rafael Omar Hernandez jr. Can't believe how time flies by just to think that it felt just like yesterday when I found I was having a symbol of mine n omars love.

You’re my angel! Te quiero mucho mi vida! With love always mommy!
I love art. Art that moves me. I love beauty. When something moves me, gets me feeling, I see it as beautiful. (Not horror images though, moving me to tears.)

What I have in my house, I have it there cause when I see it, and it makes me feel good. I have a stack of art postcards that are not up on the wall cause some are grotesque and weird and amuse me momentarily but not on my every day wall.

So at the moment most of what is in our house, we´ve created ourselves (don´t read all ego hear cause there is plenty of other pieces of art I would like but I am choosing not to spend my assets on purchasing).

The girls and I all paint and the kids are so creative, they love to make anything. Right now they have taken over our living room, as they often do, and built a whole world for their toys to play in.

I´ve painted for about 2 years, off and on. Acrylics mostly. I like oil but it smells bad and I am very sensitive to odors. (So is Julianna by the way, she just has to stick her head out the hallway in the morning to smell if the girl upstairs have already gone to school, because of how her friends´mother smell).

I´d like to share some paintings and some drawings I did for a local art show that I was not selected to participate in, but I did them anyway.

It´s not easy to take good photos of framed art on the wall but I really enjoy framing my art cause it confirms and completes it in a very nice way.
I wonder what I'll think of when I look back on this months from now.. So first I'd like to say - hi me! If I read this later... ;)

Anywaaay.umm. So lately my heart has been hurting and I know I've been pretty emo, but I think that’ll change now. Spent an awesome night with my brudder, got a Lovato pep-talk, and just spent time with my best friends (saw orphan - scaaaryy!!!!), so its just amazing. I'm happy.

Thank you all for that unconditional support you showed me, that's how I know I have the best fans in the whole wide world :)

You guys are seriously the absolute. Best.

I love you guys so so so so so much!! Your so amazing to me and I hope my music and my work expresses a small amount of how truly grateful I am for you. I cherish you from the bottom of my heart.

I love you!!!
Ps picture comments please :) xx.
Love always, XX,

Yes i realize that i have already written a blog today but after becoming a blogger so many different topics have played on my mind and i really need to get this one out of my head before it is all that i think about.

Music can change a persons mood, it can fill in as background noise or it can be the reason many people are gathering in the one location but my question tonight is; Is music really so influential on peoples lives?

I ask this because i just finished watching a DVD or pinks latest tour. now its no secret that i am a die hard pink fan, but her music has helped me through some very hard times in my life. For as long as i can remember i have listened to her music and learnt all of her songs word for word trying to learn hat they are about and their meanings. Now I'm not saying every one else is a die hard fan of hers but every person has at least one band that they love unconditionally, my partners for example is Korn.

The thought that has continued to run through my mind all day is "does music influence others the way it does me?" I'd really like to know, because i know in my life every time i look back on a hard part, a good part, the times that always make me cry and the times that always make me laugh, the on common denominator is music, different types for different moods or occasions but still music.

Meg's recent post on fears and dreams in partnership inspired me to make public my own. This wont be a comprehensive entry. It will be an expression of pain and hope. I will be back soon to write a real game plan, a real inspiring post.

My partner and I live 3 hours from one another. He is in grad school, I work to support us. He's come a long way and put in a lot of time, effort and money to make our partnership possible. We are both sacrificing and risking a lot, but we do so with great enthusiasm and trust that our dream of spending our lives together - supporting and challenging one another - will be realized.

As it stands it is difficult not to be focused on Destination Happiness. I wrote an ode to August 2010 last night. That's the month where we start breathing easy or at least in a more reliable rhythm. He'll be working, and we'll be living in the same city, under the same roof.

My fear is that I'll get more entrenched in this habit of thinking of the next step instead of loving where we are now.

When I lived in London I was very much in the moment. Because the moments were so fantastic probably. I've been thinking often about the first time I ever cooked for him. We sat cross-legged on 2 meters of floor in my small flat, eating a homemade steak dinner off an overturned cardboard box for a table - I thought not of my microscopic bank account. We were so present in that moment. We glowed, we gazed at one another from across the 'table'. What fun it is to be broke and in love!

Someday soon, I will see the distance from his front door to mine as equivalent to that cardboard box. Something we had to do for the time being, something that makes us stronger. In the meantime I will try and glow and gaze from across the the highway.
I'm into the Roaring 40s!! I crossed over into the 40s late last night. The skies didn't turn black, there was no roaring wind or crashing seas, no pouring rain or anything else. In fact, all there was to hear was the occasional flogging of my sails as the little bit of wind I did have faltered in and out.

Every big event that has taken place during my trip seems to be maddeningly calm and slow. When I left Marina del Rey, there was barely enough wind to keep my sails full, I almost crossed the equator twice in one day because there was no wind and a current pushing me backwards and now I have a good day with lots of wind but I get into the "Roaring" 40s and my wind dies. Next thing you know I'll be down at Cape Horn up on deck in a swimming suit reading a book!

As frustrating as it is, I guess I am really lucky to have such calm weather so far, even if it doesn't make for many exciting stories. The wind is beginning to pick up so hopefully I'll be able to make up for the slow day.

My chart desk seat is much more stable. Whether thats due to the Velcro thats all over the bottom now or just because of it being calmer out I have yet to find out. It was nice to have a little bit of calm weather and sun to give everything a good check over, finish up a few jobs, and get the batteries nice and full from the solar panels.

I'm about two weeks away from Cape Horn now and very excited to be getting so close!

Well, thats all for now. Thank you all for your comments! I really enjoy hearing from everyone!
There are currently... let's see... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, maybe 10 persons (and that's without their affiliated persons) the thoughts of whom upset me in one way or another. With 6-7 or them it's really bad. With two of them it's decidedly painful. Rejection, deceit, jealousy, unrequited love, hopeless mutual love, loss, misunderstandings, conflict, hurtful words, unanswered questions, ignored requests, longing, regrets, uncertainty, anger, blame, self-questioning, guilt, unfulfilled desire, disregarded feelings, inability to understand... Keeping my thoughts away from them is exhausting. I need a place to rest my thoughts.
so anyways i usually work about 36-48 hours a week depending on the week and the days vary to 3-4 days a week and every other weekend. i work at a level one trauma center in roanoke and we see about a million patients a day ranging from all sorts of diseases and problems. to say the least we are very very busy and the staffing is short these days. i enjoy what i did and just recently finished recieving my bachelors degree in nursing from a local school in the community. i am hoping to further my career in nursing one day but i want to learn as much as i can right now and take a few years off from school.



i currently live with my boyfriend (just moved in about 3 weeks ago) aprox 45 minutes from the town i grew up in where all of our friends live and where i work. so far so good. i loveliving up at the lake. it has been a little bit of an adjustment getting used to commuting back and forth to roanoke. we are in the process of cleaning up around the house. yesterday he took off from work so we could clean the yard,the back and from porch and "de-clutter" some things from the trailer. :) anyways...we worked all day cleaning and picking up. thank goodness he helped me, because one person doing all the work is very difficult. derek put up solar lights around the house which look really good. lots of work to be done but by the time summer rolls around hopefully we'll be all ready to celebrate the summer and spend time with family and friends up here at the lake. today i am off so it will be a time for lots of laundry and dishes...maybe a little work out.
If you know me pretty well, you'll know that doing this was stepping pretty far outside of my comfort zone. But I told myself that when we moved, I wanted to have more people over. At the old house, we almost never did. Partly due to our antisocial leanings, but also because of the house itself. It just made me feel self-conscious to have people in it unless I was very comfortable with them.

So, it was good and I'm glad we did it. I'm happy that we were part of making something cool and wild and crazy happen for Zeb as one of his final memories of the Life Learners. I also offered to take one of the kids to the park the next day with us, as his mom is not in town right now, and I discovered how well he gets along with all my kids, so I think perhaps more play-dates could be in our future. So that was a very good thing.

I had been thinking and worrying a lot lately that there was not enough social interaction in my girls' lives. Having this sleepover has helped me to see that maybe I'm just not doing enough to invite opportunities into our lives. But it hasn't been just this; new friends just seem to pop up when I'm open to it. I was worrying about the lack of girls around my girls' ages and then, all of a sudden, there were some. And then I realized that maybe they don't need girl friends quite as much as I thought they did. They all three of them had such a fun time with the boy who stayed after everyone else was gone.
Having forgotten to take my book on the Metro this morning, and then discovering that the battery in my MP3 player was dead, I spent 20 minutes investigating what my fellow travellers were reading! Yes, I was bored.

Top place went to the variety of free newspapers that can be picked up outside various shops, or are handed out on the streets (20 Minutos, Que and ADN). I normally get a copy of 20 Minutos at the top of the Metro stairs on the way to my early class at the Ministry of the Environment. It's handed to me by a man whose face I have never seen. Come rain or shine, he's bundled up in a waterproof jacket, gloves, hat and a scarf that's wrapped around his face only leaving his eyes exposed. Still, his eyes appear to be smiling and there's usually a muffled "Hola". Maybe once summer comes, I'll actually find out what he looks like!

One very geeky, terribly small, thin man who looked about as far removed from a football fan as anyone I've ever seen was dissecting his copy of Marca, the Real Madrid official paper.

No less than 3 people were reading whatever that damn red and black book is by the author that died before publication of the final part (someone please tell me what it is!).
