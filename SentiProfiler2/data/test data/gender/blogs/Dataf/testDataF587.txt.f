Today was the day. Today was the day I spent all afternoon in my kitchen, blissfully free in bare feet and with the living room window open, cool air kissing around my legs as my long skirt swished and moved. Today spring was like a voice in my head, the one that talks with a rhythm spun out&nbsp;on gypsy jazz, all bouncy nonsense and playful lisps. Spring and autumn are my most sensually extravagant times. In the fall I go mad for plums and the first of the root vegetables. All of my body seems to gravitate to my hips and legs, those pillars that are heavy on the earth, intimate with its lumbering ways. But in the spring I’m all toes and fingers and buzzing brain. When that sun finally finds its way into me I am like a newborn thing, fresh and wide open to every passing scent and sight. Yesterday I shopped. I bought bright things: a pink shirt, a purple one, one with red roses, a blue bra, a little white sweater. The air was cool but the sun was out and as warm as I have felt it in forever, so I swung my shopping bags and sashayed from store to store. Today I dyed my hair a little blonder, looked in the mirror to see my blue eyes glow just a little brighter. Tomorrow my beloved visits and I wanted to prepare something that exudes my current heightened state of deliciousness. A collaboration of many, many good things. So I have cooked up a traditional lasagne, made the rich tomato sauce, simmered it long and slow with garlic, onions, carrot, torn pieces of salty prosciutto, a good dash of white wine and a massive handful of fresh, soft, fragrant basil. The ragu alone took three steps and plenty of cooking, and when it was finished I alternated between squeals of excitement and groans of pleasure. Oh, it is good. The lasagne waits to be baked, gorgeous strips of mozzarella and the rest of the prosciutto tossed around atop the creamy white sauce that covers the pasta. Forty minutes in the oven and if the aroma does not seduce my Scotsman, then my kitchen witch days are numbered. For dessert I have made mousse chocolat, a Green and Black’s dark chocolate wonder with a slosh of French brandy. For now they also sit in the fridge, bittersweet clouds drawn down from their formations and piled into wine glasses. Oh my, spring is here. Mmmmm…tangy. Take the first song you hear and make yourself at home, all that languid hope lost on strings and rhythmic vibrations. Pretend you live in a place that is both old and saturated with sunlight. The kind of place where lemon trees grow in the front gardens of old ladies who dress in black and wear head scarves. They bicker like all the other old ladies in the world, except they have lemon trees in their gardens and their feet know the arch and&nbsp;angle of every cobble on their street. This afternoon as I was walking home my head was caught in a cloud of scent. Lilacs, as if suddenly I was about to crash into a mountain of them, pollen raining down and staining my skin and clothes. But when I looked I saw only a small plant inside a grocery bag which was being carried by the woman in front of me. I thought:&nbsp;I want to be as bold as that plant, issuing such an exuberant pulse into the world that doesn’t expect it. Think of&nbsp;kissing strangers just as they are on the brink of a decision, then stepping back and watching everything they have ever been slip from their expressions. They can’t remember where they are, who they have been, what they were thinking. They can only feel the breath that has left their lungs and the ghost of your lips on theirs. Leave them before they find their way back to themselves. Store up those strange, blissful manifestations. Know that periodically throughout their lives, they will remember that moment as if it were some porthole to themselves that they haven’t found since. I can’t remember the last time I was barefoot outside. I think it has been cold forever, even though the sun blazed into my eyes as I walked down Princes Street and resisted crossing and going into the bookstore. Even though there are tiny flowers poking up through the grass in the park and the teenage boys are starting to venture out in t-shirts, their hands dug deep into their pockets as they pull their shoulders forward and attempt to create warmth inside the curves of their chests. No, I can’t stop thinking about&nbsp;a land of olives and sundried tomatoes and fruit that squishes juice almost as soon as you touch it. Somewhere you can still feel the warmth in the stones of the buildings all the way until the evening, until eventually the night pulls the last of it out like the final little shudder after an orgasm. The one that makes your whole body relax and sends you off to sleep. People keep telling me spring is coming. But it isn’t enough. I need to be filled with the sun, bathed in it, turned over in it until not one inch of my skin remains&nbsp;cool to the touch. I want to be like the Lilac, like the stones in the evening. A giant pulse, a little shudder. Bliss. Gee, what did you do this weekend, Sophia? Not much. Farmers' Market, bit of cooking. Oh, and I wandered around the city taking photos of a sock monkey . And you? What did you get up to? -found this today. Written a few years ago to beloved friends of mine. I miss you so much I would snuggle down in those words if it wasn't 30 degrees So I've put them in the freezer Every once in awhile I take them out and give them a lick There is a hint of saskatoon and full moon first frost stirred with rosehips and honey. Tasted individually The I holds the metallic purity of an icicle snapped from where it was hanging from the roof of a lonely (but snug) cabin. Both M's are all berry bliss the sun finding a way to drip and swell. I have to linger over ss to coax out the cinnamon the autumn waiting bees tucking away their stings. Y is surprisingly cherry flavoured while Ou is milky, a cream stirred so long and with such love that it can only be eaten scooped straight from the bowl with a hooked finger. The single small s is bursting with sun-warmed wild strawberry The kind I crouched over and plucked as a child Popping their ruby bodies into my mouth before performing the miracle - my tongue crushing them against my palate loving and destroying them in one sweetsour second. The o which follows holds the tang of snow freshly fallen and grazed upon from where it is heaped on the wooden railing. u how much can this letter hold? The tang of it keeps changing one second it's salty broth like the perfect veggie stock sipped from a hot spoon Then smoke the flavour used to purify a space in the spring sandlewood freshly peeled birch bark pine needles and the first shoots of dandelion leaves The spices may alter but u always holds the zest of an offering. ch is a fast-melting orange juice popsicle clear ice crystals becoming exposed as the juice is frantically sucked It works if you make the sound while breathing in It becomes the noise of a locomotive chugging backwards through slush Overall Five single syllables have made me feel so much better And I am taking a moment to thank you before I head once again to the freezer Today it snowed. Driving, freezing sleet. I am waiting for the world to change its perfume, waiting&nbsp;to feel the heat from the sun make an exchange with the soil, to walk through the haze of it, feel my body remember. For Renee : I love knowing that by late this afternoon I'll be in his flat, already laughing and sharing details of our day. Two trains and a hike uphill&nbsp;- I know the route so well now. And if it's nice tomorrow I'll head out for adventures, seeing what I can see. Last weekend I saw some shells, and since I resisted picking them up, I collected their images instead.
