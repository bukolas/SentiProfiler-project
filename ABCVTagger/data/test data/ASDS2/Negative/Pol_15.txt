Mr. Torney asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science if he will ensure that future appointments to the University Grants Committee result in a wider representation of interests on the committee.
Mr. Waldegrave: Members of the University Grants Committee and its sub-committees are not appointed to represent particular institutions. They are already drawn from a wide range of academic and industrial backgrounds.
