Activists help put an end to gross negligence and primate deaths at a University lab . It's amazing to me that most Universities, even seemingly progressive ones like UC Berkeley, conduct useless experiments on animals. Legendary "Humanzee" Oliver, his friends, and the bitter fight over animal welfare at a Texas refuge . "MEPs Jens Holm, Caroline Lucas, Sajjad Karim, and Robert Evans are today calling on other MEPs to back a landmark call to make plans for an end to the use of chimpanzees and monkeys in experiments across the European Union (EU) . The call comes at a point when almost 50 MEPs have signed a declaration before the European Parliament to end primate research across the EU in the next six years." Let's hope the U.S. wakes up and follows Europe's lead. I find it very sad that we as a nation aren't leading this fight for compassionate science. New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) has the most captive primates in the world, and is affiliated with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. A former employee revealed disturbing allegations of animal cruelty that prompted an investigation and lawsuit , and another group that analyzed reports requested from the University (as is our right under the Freedom of Information Act) found disturbing signs of abuse and neglect relating to a group of rhesus monkeys . NIRC has also conducted maternal deprivation experiments , what I consider to be one of the more cruel, useless, abominable "research" activities. Write to Thomas J. Rowell, the veterinarian in charge, and request that the aging chimpanzees under his care be released to a sanctuary. These animals will not be forgotten. Thomas J.

Also, facilities that receive federal funding such as Chimp Haven must return animals to laboratories if they are requested to. In my book, that's not really retirement. Project R&R; has a list of sanctuaries that can take animals , and notes which have received funding, and I assume approval, from them. Personally, after watching Chimpanzees: An Unnatural History on PBS and getting to "know" Gloria Grow , I think the Fauna Sanctuary is truly a place that's earned it's name. Most Americans think that chimpanzees who have spent more than 10 years in research deserve to be retired : seventy-one percent of us, in fact. Despite this, nearly 90 percent of lab chimps have been used for more than 10 years. Jane Goodall's pioneering research has opened a window into the private lives of chimps. To read how similiar they are to humans, visit JGI's Chimpanzee Central . "Once we admit that we are not the only beings with personality, reasoned thought, and above all, the ability to feel and express emotions such as joy, despair and empathy, then we develop a new respect for chimpanzees. The line between human and other non-human beings, once thought so sharp, becomes blurred. This forces us to a new respect also for the other amazing animal beings with whom we share the planet. " From the Wisconsin State Journal : "A Dane County judge said Monday that the law is on the side of animal-rights activists who want to buy buildings next to the UW-Madison's primate labs and open a museum highlighting the cruelty they say happens at the labs."
