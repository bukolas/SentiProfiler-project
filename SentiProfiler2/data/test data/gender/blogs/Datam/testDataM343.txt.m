Only the brave take on a complete renovation while living in the space, but Jay, a professional painter and general handy man, is wired for these types of projects. Their home is made cozy by their choices of plush furniture, throw blankets, and vignetted nooks, and is unified by neutral creams and natural wood. The fresh baked cookies and colorful cut roses adorning all rooms pay tribute to their bed & breakfast inspired feel.

Melissa is a graphic designer and likes incorporating typography. The DIY triptych in the living room exemplifies this as well as the burlap coffee sack curtains she made using simple black ribbon.

All flooring other than the back living room (which is still on their to do list) has mix-matched original hardwood floors and no two rooms are the same. There are polyurethane boards in some rooms, while others are left sanded and dull, making a quilt-like pattern in the space, complimenting their aesthetic.

In their kitchen they removed an L-shaped corner counter top and added a center island from IKEA. In order to integrate the modern island into the space, they covered it with bead board and added a matching laminate counter top. They made the island big enough to fit up to 8 people and use this intimate setting for dinner guests, rather than a formal dining room.

Now that the work is nearly completed, they are looking for another fixer-upper two family and hope to have at it once again.
