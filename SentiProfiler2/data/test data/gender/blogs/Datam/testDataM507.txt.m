hey :) Cool questions, is this like a test? I would say guys probably did lose weight faster then women at a guess. This could either be because of some biological reason such as men having more muscle the women thus having higher metabolisms, or it could be due to the stereotypical ways in which we train differently. In general women shy away from doing weights because the don't want to look manly but lifting weights causes a much higher increase in resting metabolic rate then cardio does. So there's my ill informed answer lol hope it helps in some way :)
