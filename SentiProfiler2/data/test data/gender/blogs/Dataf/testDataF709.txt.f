I'd never laid fingers to a MAC before my husband purchased two for us last month. I've been a loyal Gateway customer until the last one started crapping out a year before the 3 year extended warranty was up, and they gave me problems about fixing it. I said "no more!" and started looking at the iMAC. I love it! Easy to learn, easy to use, so many options, and I can still use Microsoft Office on it, which is important to me, because I do work that requires Word.
