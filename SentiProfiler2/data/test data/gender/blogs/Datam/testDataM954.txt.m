I'm getting older every day and I am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. I am Husband to 1, Daddyo to 5, Grand(Poppy) to another 5 (so far). I use Nikon Cameras and Lenses ... but I really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with ANY kind of camera. Photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. It has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. I am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. I think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos I capture and in effect "see through my eyes" but for a moment. Thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. I hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. All of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way. God bless you all. NikonSniper Steve
