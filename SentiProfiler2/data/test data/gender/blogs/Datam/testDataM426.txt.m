Over the past year, there were many moments when I just wanted to be left alone. I didn't want to hear any type of advice. Words of encouragement were often transformed midair into little daggers that somehow made me feel worse instead of better. On top of struggling with a major progression of my rheumatoid arthritis, I was also having a difficult time accepting the full extent of my depression. And as is often the case with depression, my mind was constantly tricking itself into believing that I was more comfortable staying where I was, than trying to dig myself out of the emotional hole that I was in. “Too difficult”, “not possible” and “I can't” were phrases that all too often floated around in my head. So when helping hands were offered, I often found it much easier to snap at them. “I don't need help. I can help myself.” So true, yet so false at the same time. I could help myself…but I would need help in doing so. I started seeking the help that I needed.
