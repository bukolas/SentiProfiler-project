I have some photos I've been meaning to post from David Reid who went to Lola a few months ago. I've post them all over the next few weeks!This is Makali, a bonobo rescued from a biomedical centre. He has somethign to say! Noki and her baby are in wonderful health! they've been released into the enclosures. Noki is nursing her baby well and protecting her from slapping branches and the sun. but she is also very proud and loves to show the baby to the other bonobos! ooo - i got this photo from Val when Noki just arrived at Lola. Val is a volunteer at Lola - and has been for 15 years. She works practically full time handling Lola's accounts - the sanctuary wouldn't run without her. She comes in to Lola almost every day, for no recognition or reward other than helping the bonobos. We love you Val! and look at little Noki and those huge black eyes.and then here is Val helping Noki give birth - 10 years later!we share so much with these bonobos, they become so much a part of our lives. Val has been sending photos like crazy - she is a very proud grandmother. Ok back to Lola now and I'm a little behind on all the news - but Noki had a baby!! Noki is one of the cat burglers at Lola - she is also a prolific tool user - which bonobos haven't been seen to do in the wild, fyi. once she used a long stick to steal my camera bag. noki is also one of the smartest bonobos in all the experiments we do - she is so wildly interested in all the tests and sometimes we have trouble getting her out of the testing room!  now she has a baby!! Fanny the vet was there for the whole thing, and so was Valerie, who was there when Noki was first rescued...
