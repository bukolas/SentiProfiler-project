Hi Kristyn! I thought this was a really well done blog on sensory integration dysfunction. I will pass it on to others. I found out last year that my son is very sensory seeking. I had never heard of sensory integration concerns before my son started exhibiting signs of this dysfunction, and it was a very confusing time for me. I wish I had gone on-line and connected with others! Currently, I am trying to raise awareness about SPD through our book I Can Be: A Child's Whimsical Introduction to Yoga. I have been practicing this book with my son since he was a baby and little did I know that it was a great tool for his sensory concerns. A percentage of our proceeds goes to a local nonprofit dedicated to preventing developmental delays through education. If you get a moment, we also have a blog, our website is www.qandjbirdpress.com. I look forward to reading more of your blogs.
