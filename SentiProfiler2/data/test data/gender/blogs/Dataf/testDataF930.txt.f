I am DEFIANTLY Thinking positive!! It's my Sister that is in need of prayer As well as my Mother. My sister Bobbi is the one in the family who has chosen to follow a not so honest path! She has been in and out of Jail & prison for multiple reason mostly drugs and theft. She in detained right now and had collapsed THREE Times when...  they finally took her to the hospital after she tried to hold herself up as she was blacking out AGAIN and ripped the toilet out of the jail floor. THEN they took her to the ER!!! They did a CAT on her and was tested positive and has a spot on her brain. Then they TOOK HER BACK TO JAIL!!! I think that they should take this more seriously!!! Donâ€™t you? There are family members that do love her. I am trying to hold good thoughts for my mom because she is not that strong unfortunately. Please Pray for them both!! XOXO THANK YOU!
