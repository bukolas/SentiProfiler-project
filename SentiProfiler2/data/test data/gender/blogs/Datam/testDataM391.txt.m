Every Wednesday my school takes groups of students out and you have options where you can choose to go. The options this week where Swimming, walking and gym. I decided to go to the gym. When we got there a man had to show you around and tell you how to use the equipment, I didnt want to talk to him so I stayed with my teacher in the hall. In the gym it was very loud music and a lot of people so I didnt go in, I just stayed in the hall. Then my teacher took me for a walk for a few minutes. I am not going there next week . thanks for reading, bye.
