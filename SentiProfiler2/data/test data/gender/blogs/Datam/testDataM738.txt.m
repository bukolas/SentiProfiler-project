to conduct some full-page interviews with people I never thought I'd talk to. For the September issue, I yakked on the horn with the still very much bad-ass Ice Cube. Out this month, my interview with stripper-obsessed impresario T-Pain. And in December, they'll print my conversation with Stone Temple Pilot Scott Weiland.And to cap this very good day off -- Obama even won Indiana! -- this week's newly published Time Out New York features my interview with Paul Rudd, who is more awesome than Joe Biden's mother.To celebrate all this good news -- although after staying out until 3am last night, I probably don't need any more of that -- I am listening to my new favorite song by the Flaming Lips, which isn't at all new, as you'll no doubt see by this straight-outta-the-early-1990s video:WHY I'M ANGRY TODAYI've tried, but I am finding that it is impossible to be angry today!
