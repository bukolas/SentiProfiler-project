Ok Fellas, hopefully all the stragglers have caught up and finished the first book by now!
We have confirmed that we will have our first meeting Saturday 12/12/09.
Do us all a favor and don't show up not knowing what the Whole book is about because you didn't finish it. You might get voted off the Island...

Our new book for December will be "Holy Lockdown", by Jeremiah Camara
