Today I'm inspired by Moerenuma Park in Sapporo, Japan designed by Isamu Noguchi. The entire park is considered to be a sculpture! What a fun place this would be to have a picnic and take the kids. Look at the variety of facilities here. Have any of you readers been for a visit?(Photo Credits 1 - Nobihaya 2 - Saname777 3 - James King 4 &amp; 6 Elle* :  5: Antsinpants) Have you seen the beautiful looks of Ann Taylor Loft lately? I am a Lucky Magazine Style Shopper, so I was sent a Spring Loft look book and items to peruse and was really charmed. I enjoy the fact that the Loft has wonderfully styled clothing at reasonable price points, especially when they have sales and promotions. I am in love with the girl's bun -- wish I could pull that off.(images from Loft lookbook) Last week I bought the song Sweet Disposition by Temper Trap on itunes and I cannot get it out of my head! What do you think?You may have heard it before, because it was featured in this commercial, this commercial, and this movie. Have you seen the stunning details of Eunice and Daniel's wedding in Martha Stewart Weddings? Eunice is the creative director and co-owner/founder of the specialty letterpress design studio Hello! Lucky -- one of my lovely sponsors, doesn't their day looks so magical! You'll want to peek at more photos at Martha Stewart and Hello Lucky, because there are many more details to see.
