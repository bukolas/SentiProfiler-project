English translation ::Fighting the Heads of Infidelity(Sada al-Malahim ) In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate Praise be to God Who said: `Fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained` (Partial Koranic verse, Al-Tawbah, 9:12). Prayers and peace be upon God Messenger who said: `Who would stand up for Ka`b Bin-al-Ashraf for he has harmed God and His Messenger?` The Arabian Peninsula in general and the lands of the Two Sacred Mosques (Saudi Arabia) stand in the gateway of a new phase of the conflict between the truth and falsehood; between the believing mujahidin and the heads of infidelity from the rulers of Al Sa`ud. This ruling family has transgressed in the country and spread corruption. They blocked the application of God`s laws, permitted usury, plundered the wealth of Muslims, and established the military bases for the Crusader forces that attack our brothers in Iraq and Afghanistan and support the Jews who occupied Jerusalem. The Al Sa`ud have fought all classes of Muslims. They have arrested the scholars, preachers, teachers of Shari`ah, and the mujahidin, among which are Shaykh Walid al-Sinani, Shaykh Sa`id Bin-Zu`ayr, Shaykh Salman al-Ulwan, Shaykh Hamad al-Hamidi, Shaykh Faris al-Zahrani, Shaykh Abd-al-Aziz al-Tuwayli`i, Shaykh Nasir al-Fahd, and many others. They were not satisfied with this, but they arrested hundreds of the seekers of knowledge and their followers until the number of detainees exceeded 8,000. Not only this, but they also arrested university professors specialized in physics, chemistry, and other different branches of science in Saudi Arabia. They described them as small gangs as their head, the Pharaoh of Egypt, described Moses, peace be upon him, and his people (in the Koran). They have also described them as deviated groups similar to what Almighty God said about the infidels in His words: `And whenever they saw them, they would say, `Behold! These are the people truly astray!` (Koranic verse, Al-Mustaffifin, 83:32). The rulers of Al Sa`ud have pursued and killed the mujahidin and put them and their wives in jail. They have heinously tortured the mujahidin and violated their honor and their prisons are the best proof against them. The Al Sau`d have also handed some mujahidin over to their countries to please their US Christian masters. The rulers of Al Sa`ud and the followers of Ibn-Salul (Derogatory reference to Al Sa`ud monarchy) were an obstacle in the path of the Muslims and the mujahidin all over the Muslim countries. They have created the Awakening Councils in Iraq and Afghanistan and attempted to quench the light of Almighty God. This severe campaign against Muslims was shouldered to Prince Muhammad Bin-Nayif Al Sa`ud, who is called the defeater of terrorism `Islam.` Yet, a grandson of Muhammad Bin-Maslamah, may God be pleased with him; a lion of the lions of Islam and a heroic mujahid; a migrant in the cause of God, who escaped the tyrants of Al Sa`ud, Brother Abu-al-Khayr Abdallah Hasan Tali al-Asiri, stood up for him. He carried out a qualitative martyrdom operation that was the first of its kind against the tyrants of Al Sa`ud. Abu-al-Khayr was a pioneer of goodness and a defeater of evil, who revived the tradition of assassinating the heads of infidelity. What the well-reputed mujahid brother Abu-al-Khayr has done pleased the believers. He boldly and confidently crossed all the strongholds of Al Sa`ud and their security barriers and penetrated into their palaces. He did not pay homage to them, but he used a trick just like what Muhammad Bin-Maslamah, may God be pleased with him, did. He humiliated Al Sa`ud and opened the door widely before the Muslims in Saudi Arabia to assassinate the heads of infidelity of Al Sa`ud and the tyrants of the Arabian Peninsula. Let us restore the dignity and glory of this nation and establish the rightly-guided caliphate on the path of the Prophet to replace the current oppressive governorship. As the honest and trusted one said in a hadith narrated by Imam Ahmad: `until religion is all for God.` By this martyrdom operation, Brother Abu-al-Khayr made Al Sa`ud drink from the same cup they have forced the Muslims and the mujahidin to drink from for a long time. Thus, fear and panic filled their hearts because of what they saw. Yet, we wish to tell Al Sa`ud: `Wait for what will harm you. Your star has fainted and your governorship has vanished, God willing. Do not be deceived by the scholars of evil who distort the real meaning of the words and favored this life over the hereafter. They sold the verses of God for a very trivial price. By God, we brought you some men who love death as much as you love life.` We call every Muslim, who is zealous for his religion and nation, to kill the heads of infidelity of Al Sa`ud; everyone according to his abilities. Brother Abu-al-Khayr has opened the door to attack Al Sa`ud; therefore, you have to enter and not fear them for you are victorious, God willing. Let the tyrant Muhammad Bin-Nayif know that everyone`s life is predestined by God and that his escape from death is just a plan by God to drag him to his punishment. `By degrees, shall We punish them from directions they perceive not. A (long) respite will I grant them: truly powerful is My Plan` (Koranic verses, Al-Qalam, 68:45). The last words of our brother Abu-al-Khayr, may God have mercy on him, in his last telephone conversation were: `I ask you to think well of God. There is a hadith that says: `I am as My servant thinks I am.` Therefore, think well of God because the favorable judgment on God is the key to goodness in this life and the hereafter.` Yes, we trust God because God`s promise to grant victory and strength to the believing people will be fulfilled, no doubts about that. Victory comes after patience until God alone is worshipped without any partners and religion is all for God. `And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take!` (Partial Koranic verse, Al-Shu`ara, 26:227).” source: Sada al-Malahim (The Echo of the Epic Battles) 11th issue
