In November we went to Disneyland with our friends and neighbors the Heatons. We had an absolute blast!! This was part of our Christmas to our family and it was a much needed break from life and a chance to have some fun as a family. Kinsley wasn't too thrilled when we told her about the rides and stuff, but when we told her that she would be meeting the princesses, her eyes became like saucers and she got soooo excited. She met as many as she could and even met some of the others like Mickey Mouse, Pluto, and Woody and Jessie. She actually liked most of the rides like Matterhorn and Space Mountain, but absolutely hated Splash Mountain. When we got to the bottom of that drop, Kristie and I (who were sitting behind her) asked what she thought and she started bawling. She really didn't like that experience so to get her on any other ride, we couldn't include the word "mountain" in the name or she wouldn't get on. Kenton loved all the sights, animals, rides, etc. The first ride we went on was Pirate's of the Carribean (my absolute fav!) just to see how the kids would fare with this. Geoff used his phone to see Kenton's facial expression when we first went in the dark tunnel before it dropped. His eyes were wide, and his hands were in fists and stuck to the front of his mouth. But he loved it! He kept getting excited at all the animals and moving people. He really loved it! Kinsley loved it too. She said that was her favorite ride. In the two days we were there, we went on that one 3 times. All in all it was a great vacation and one we hope to repeat again sooner than later.
