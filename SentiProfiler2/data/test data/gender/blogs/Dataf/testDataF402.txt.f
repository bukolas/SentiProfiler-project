Getting out of the capital of the Philippines, Manila, to nearby cities and towns is not an uncommon occurrence among the urban dwellers. With friends and relatives from abroad visiting every now and then, it gives us more reason to escape the metropolis. But with the “Viaje del Sol”, Spanish for “Way of the Sun”, we have all the more reason to embark on an adventure north of Manila.It was a road trip like no other. Armed with a Viaje del Sol map that would take us to the provinces of Laguna and Quezon, we studied and selected various tourist spots where we can stop over.
