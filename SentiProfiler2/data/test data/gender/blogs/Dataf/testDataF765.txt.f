Then there's my work life. I had an incredible review from my boss 2 weeks ago, and have been slowly adding more and more to my occupational plate as opportunities have been presenting themselves. I'm now going to be the head coach for 7th/8th grade girls' volleyball in the fall. I'm working at the Harlem School of the Arts this summer, just two mornings a week, but they've tentatively asked me if I'd be interested in working their Saturday program during the school year. I have three new piano students for the fall -- kids who are my students at school and will now also be my private piano students. I had my first lesson today with one of them, and it was incredible.
