Let us hope Donnie Walsh's free-agent signing this summer works out better than the one he made in December with Jonathan Bender.

Bender's season is over as he will have surgery Monday on his broken ring finger he injured Friday vs. Philly. Bender's career may be over, at least with the Knicks, who are not expected to bring him back next season.

The 6-11 Bender played in 25 games and averaged 4.6 points. He had an excellent start, playing with panache his first three games before petering out. Bender was only playing Friday in place of injured David Lee and Wilson Chandler.

In the end, it wasn't worth the expenditure or the fact it teed off Eddy Curry, who was benched after three games to make way for Bender.

MSG P.R. man Sammy Steinlight leaves the Garden in a week (check out tomorrow's Rumble for more on his future). Steinlight will be sorely missed.

The best tip Sammy ever gave me was not Knicks-related. A diehard Springsteen fan, he called one afternoon a few years back and said he's hearing from sources Springsteen was going to make a surprise appearance that night at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park.

A Springsteen band member, Suzie Tyrell, was the headliner and Bruce, Sammy claimed, planned to take the stage for a few songs. My friends and I skeptically piled into a car and made the long drive from Long Island. Sammy's rep was on the line as there's always frequent false rumors of Bruce at the Stone Pony. Bruce indeed showed that night and Sammy became a legend among my friends.
