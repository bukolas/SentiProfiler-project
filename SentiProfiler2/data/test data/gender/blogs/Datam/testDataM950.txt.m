Theyâ€™re re-building Banbury Cross or at least one of them, there are supposed to have been six original crosses dotted about the town. These were vabdalised by Cromwell's troops during the English civil war as part of their purging of Catholic monuments throughout England and later Wales, Cornwall, Scotland and of course Ireland. There is already a Victorian cross that stands in the middle of a busy roundabout which no one can get near to but this new one, by all appearances will be a monstrosity made from modern materials. At a time when money is short for frivalries I can understand why the council has opted not to have the cross built using more traditional techniques, but I am deeply resentful that this money has not gone to providing affordable council housing instead of the local housing lotery that they farcicly use in place of providing taxpayers with their deserved security.
