good2c the griffmiester has already hit up the new apple store at chadstone. heard about it on my radio this morning, tauntin me they had lots of ipod touches in stock, literally. it's not much for melbourne but it's a start. techgeek.com.au also has a gr8 gallery of the store, free apple tshirt + itouch he just posted a review on : "The Touch remains a tremendous and innovative device, with enticing features, unparalleled ease of use, and plenty of expandability through the App Store.", and jealously a itouch and tshirt:( :P Techgeek.com.au on Chadstone store : "The first 1,000 people (which included me) got a free t-shirt, and I managed to snag a iPod Touch while I was there - with me giving my input soon. The store still looks like what you expect from Apple, and this store has the Genius bar, meaning that you can always ask them for support."
