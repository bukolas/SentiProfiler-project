Yesterday was the typical Saturday.  Up early and on my way to a job.  It seems like more and more I'm working every Saturday.  Partly because business is good, and partly because some things I have to do are better done when employees of clients are not around to get in my way.  Yesterday's adventure was to change the lamps and ballasts of ten recessed compact fluorescent fixtures located over the grand entrance stairs of a giant software company.
Simple, right?
I had to rent special scaffolding that is designed to be used over stairs.  I had to drive twenty miles down to San o Haze Friday with my personal truck and trailer to pick up the scaffold because it wouldn't fit into my company van.  Loaded and ready, I headed for the Dumbarton bridge and Shallow Alto as the sun was rising Saturday morning.
For several years, I have had an automated toll paying device that allows me to zip through without having to interact with a human toll collector.  Because of the multi axle trailer I was pulling, I opted to pay cash for the toll so I would have a receipt to turn in for reimbursement of the eight dollars it was going to cost to cross the bridge.
