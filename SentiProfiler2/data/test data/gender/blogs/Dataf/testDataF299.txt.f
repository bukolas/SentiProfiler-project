I'd like to have a comprehensive list of links on the side of the blog so that people interested in school lunches, nutrition, food politics, food journalism, food service, foodies, mommy meal planners, school gardeners, school lunch companies, etc. But I don't have time to hunt each of you down and figure out your blog URL, etc. If you want to have a link in a new list to the side of the blog, please comment below with your blog's name, URL and how it might possibly relate to the discussion we have as a community around school lunches. I'll add and update the link list slowly over time (you know, when I get some!) Thanks!
