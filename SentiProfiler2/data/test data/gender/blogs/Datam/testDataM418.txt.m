The College Baseball Blog continues our weekly awards today by honoring Florida International outfielder Jabari Henry and Texas RHP Taylor Jungmann. In five games last week, Henry went 9-for-18 for a .500 batting average and a 1.389 slugging percentage. Over the five games, he hit five home runs, two of which were grand slams, registered 17 RBI, scored nine runs and totaled 25 bases. He had multi-home run games in two of the five games. He also drew three walks, stole two bases and threw a runner out from left field trying to stretch a single into a double at second base. Jungmann was outstanding on Friday night as he pitched 7.1 innings while giving up a first inning run. He ended up giving up five hits and walking only one hitter. His most impressive stat was the fact he recorded 17 strikeouts in a possible 22 outs as the Iowa Hawkeyes struggled to find a rhythm. The 17 strikeouts was a career-high and fell just two short of the school record set by Burt Hooton in a 13-inning game against Texas Tech in 1971 and tied by Eric Stone in a nine inning game against Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette) in 1998.
