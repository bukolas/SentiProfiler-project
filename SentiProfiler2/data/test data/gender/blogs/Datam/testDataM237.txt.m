President Obama has repeatedly said that failure to pass a health care reform bill is simply not an option.

But Democratic leaders are facing an uphill battle in convincing some of their own members to push the legislation forward -- and hoping history doesn't repeat itself.

There's a lot at stake for Obama's future, political observers say, including the ability to get other key pieces of his legislative agenda passed and signed into law: banking regulation, climate change, economic measures and immigration.

Republicans have marched nearly lockstep against Obama's policy proposals, especially on financial matters, and indicate that they will continue to do so.

The bill's failure could also spell trouble for Democrats facing tough election battles this year. Whether or not the bill is passed, Republicans have threatened to use it against Democratic opponents, noting its cost and effect on the deficit.

As for the costs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Democrats' revised health care bill will cost $940 billion over the next 10 years, a House Democratic source said Thursday. The bill cuts the deficit by $130 billion during that period, according to the source.

The president has stepped up his efforts to sway worried Americans. He put his name on a health care reform proposal last month and then went on a campaign-like barnstorm across the country to warn Americans what will happen if reform isn't passed.

"We need health insurance reform right now," the president said at a rally outside Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday. "This debate is about far more than politics. ... It comes down to what kind of country we want to be."

Obama said the status quo on health care is "simply unsustainable," adding that Americans "cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people."

Editorials in some of the nation's top newspapers have also railed against keeping the status quo.
