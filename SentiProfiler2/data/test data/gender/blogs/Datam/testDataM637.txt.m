There's some simmering resentment still there for Norton, though.  When he talks about the character, there is a visible love for the full history of Hulk and Marvel Comics that isn't just an actor selling a film.  He's a genuine fan, and he has ambitions still regarding the character and what he could do with it.  But if Marvel really wants to win Norton back as a public cheerleader for the company and the character, the first step would be allowing him to restore the full 2-hour-20-minute version that Norton and Leterrier wanted to release.  If they put that movie out on BluRay and DVD, I think Norton would get much more likely to sign on.  His frustration over the way running time became a battleground on his film the same year that "The Dark Knight" became a phenomenon makes perfect sense, and I think it would be great to see all the other Marvel references (like the entire Super Soldier project subplot) layered back in.
