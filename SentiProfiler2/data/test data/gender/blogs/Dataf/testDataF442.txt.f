Climbing up to Fishermanâ€™s Bastion in the Buda district and waiting till dusk to watch those final rays of sun cast their warm glow across the Danube, over the Parliament building, and across a dozen or more centuries-old churches scattered around the Pest side is a scene hundreds of photographers have probably captured yet it remains breathtaking, no less.There are a few cities that truly photograph beautifully at night, and Budapest certainly is one of them. While summer months bring in droves of tourists, traveling in early March for us meant fewer crowds and strong wispy winter chills filling the air. This also meant more locals going about their daily business, and a smaller chance of getting mugged or harassed.
