I've made my very first Mosaic picture, and it's all thanks to Mary over at Little Red House and the tutorial that she made! I do also want to thank Brenda over Cozy Little House for giving me that info! Thank you both so much! Seeing how much I loveeee pictures I know what I'm going to be doing alot of.
Please don't forget to stop in at Mary's blog Little Red House, she's the hostess of Mosaic Monday and there you'll be able to view every ones beautiful mosaic pictures, maybe even enter yourself!
So until the next time...Bead Happy!
Hugs and happy beading...
