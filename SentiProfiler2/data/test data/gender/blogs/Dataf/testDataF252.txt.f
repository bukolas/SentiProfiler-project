My name is Kim and I am another newbie to the blog. I am 28 years old and was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis 2 1/2 years ago. I take a lot of medication, which at the moment doesn't seem to be working, I am currently on 22.5mg of Methotrexate weekly, Hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day, Diclofenac 50mg three times a day plus pain killers to help control the pain and I occasionally have steroid injections when I have a flare up which is more often than not at the moment. My RA first started in my hands and wrists but has gradually spread to other parts of my body, my feet being the worst with arthritic nodules popping up. I have an appointment in a couple of weeks to see a podiatrist I am hoping they will help with the constant pain in my toes, my RA nurse and Dr always tell me to wear flat shoes and trainers but to be honest it doesn't make a difference what footwear I have on the pain is continuous...i'd be happy wearing my slippers all day they give me the most confort but i'd look a bit stupid walking around work in my fluffy yellow slippers :-)
