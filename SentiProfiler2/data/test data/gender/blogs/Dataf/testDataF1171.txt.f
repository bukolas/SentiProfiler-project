Thalassemia is another disease that has the heterozygote advantage. This disease is very similar to sickle-cell and it also prevents malaria in heterozygotes. This disease is caused by a mutation and it causes the body to have fewer red blood cells than normal and less hemoglobin. This disease can be deadly at an early age, but in the case of a heterozygote, it can be left untreated, have blood transfusions needed, or just eating healthy. Sickle-cell is found in people of African ancestry, while thalassemia is mostly in people with Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, southern Asian and African ancestry.
