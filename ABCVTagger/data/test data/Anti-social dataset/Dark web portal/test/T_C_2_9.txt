The militant Islamic group Fatah al-Islam has said that its leader, who fled from Lebanon last year, has been martyred or captured in Syria. The group said Sheikh Shaker al-Abssi and two other members had been ambushed by the Syrian security forces in the small town of Jermana, south of Damascus. It said Sheikh Abu Mohamad Awad had been named as his successor. Fatah al-Islam fought a three-month battle with the Lebanese army last year in a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli.
