Thank you Blut Und Ehre! It is a pleasure to be here. This really is a serious topic, and leave it to the niggers to dumb it down and call us racists and bigots. Our government infrastructure is collapsing because we have to support these ignorant, inferior niggers. Our prisons are filled to the brim with negroes, at the tax payers' expense of course. Those who claim for welfare and unemployment, are mainly minorities. Our western world and ideology is fading....and our race is as well. We Americans are projected to be the minority in 2042. I cannot stand the idea of us being a minority in my own nation...the land where our forefathers and ancestors sacrificed to create this great nation we have today. Our culture and way of life is indeed coming to an end...unless we take a drastic course of action. If I must be labeled racist just for caring about the well being of my people, then so be it. We, my white brethren, should not be ashamed of expressing our racial pride! When other races express pride in their roots, it is acceptable. Why is it when we do it, we are automatically labeled as rednecks or racists? We must be comfortable in our own skin. This is the first step in regaining control of our nation. I do not want  my future children to be minorities in the country that their ancestors founded. America belongs to us! Remember this. If not, our next president will be Juan Sanchez...or Chow Ching. The mistake we made is to allow a minority to have control of us, who are the majority. I would write more, but unlike most of these degenerate minorities, have  to work tomorrow. I do not condone rednecks, nor klan members. I believe in a white movement led by rational and educated people. That is how we will survive. Until next time...
