Finally, we departed the station and took the nearest freeway. Since I got to see little as the bus entered the freeway I dozed off to sleep. I suddenly woke up in the middle of the trip and found myself staring at a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. The scenic spot was very serene. I was mesmerized that it was too late when I took out my camera. I tried to read any sign that would tell me the name of the place and found a Vista del Lago signage.
