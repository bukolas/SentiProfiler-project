AOL Inc. has just launched KitchenDaily, a new food property that adds yet another culinary site to its existing portfolio of AOL Food and the blog Slashfood.

“KitchenDaily is designed to help busy home cooks, moms in particular, make smart, informed decisions about food and cooking while also helping to instill confidence in their abilities in the kitchen,” said Stephanie Dolgins, senior vice president, AOL Women’s and Lifestyle Group, in a press release. “We aim to offer real food for real life and want our audience to know they don't have to sacrifice quality and nutrition for speed. Our extensive video series shows our experts making healthy and inexpensive dishes in the same amount of time it would take to get a pizza delivered to their door.”

The site features partnerships with a number of food personalities, including writer Mark Bittman, chef Marcus Samuelsson, and Gail Simmons of Food & Wine and "Top Chef."

Cheryl Brown, formerly of Gourmet magazine, is editor-in-chief, and Megan Steintrager, formerly of Epicurious.com, is senior editor. Gourmet food editors such as Kemp Minifie, Ruth Cousineau and Gina Marie Miraglia Eriquez have also been tapped to run the site.
