Seriously though, they're starting to wind me up. There's literally no way of telling if it's going to be a nice soft one or one of those ones that isn't hard but it isn't soft, it's just in no-man's land. It's like it doesn't know what to believe anymore (since it came back from Vietnam).
And then there are others that are perfectly nice and yellow on the outside but when you peel them they're ridiculously bruised and you just feel like saying 'well i wish you'd told me the truth from the beginning to be honest mate, cos you've wasted everyone's time now'.
I might start taking them back if i take a bite and don't like it from now on, without saying a word, just placing the banana back on the till with a face that denotes exactly how i'm feeling.
