My heart is beating whenever I see him, It’s too hard to hide it.

I don’t remember since when. He was not my type. He is too tall for me and I’m not good at typical handsome boys.

Might be I like him. 
He makes me smile a lot. He makes me happy always.
I wish he wouldn’t pretend.

I can’t make him smile and 'm not his interest. 

It‘s sad.
