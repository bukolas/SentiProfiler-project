It appears that people have Opinions about Trollope, especially about which Trollope a Trollope-virgin should Trollope with first&nbsp;(keyboard appears stuck on&nbsp;'Trollope').&nbsp; The consensii seemed to be one of The Warden, The Way We Live Now, and Can You Forgive Her? &nbsp; That last sounds deliciously salacious, but I went with the fairly short The Warden to start, due to my debilitating laziness. Laziness, you have been rewarded!&nbsp; The Warden is fantastic and sweet and a bit sad.&nbsp; Also, and I know that this is basting the turkey with Obvious Sauce, it is ridiculously Victorian.&nbsp; Because Septimus Harding is the warden of a hospital and the precentor of a cathedral and what are these things? Ok, I am still in the dark precentor-wise because Wikipedia is Too Much Work, but the warden of the hospital (which is not a 'hospital' like you're thinking, but more like an old-man charity house) is the guy who looks after the old mens.&nbsp; This is a bit complicated, but bear with me.&nbsp; A Benevolent Benefactor long ago set up said hospital along with a steady income.&nbsp; The income goes to maintain the hospital and feed the old mens, and whatever is left over goes to the warden.&nbsp; For reasons I don't understand (because I do not Get Economics), the income got bigger and suddenly the warden is making piles of money just for hanging out with some old mens. Which, fine.&nbsp; Except that some young reformer is all, NAY!&nbsp; Such injustice shall NOT go unprodded!&nbsp; And he starts prodding into what the Benevolent Benefactor's will actually stipulates and whether more of teh moneys should go to the old mens and whether the warden is living off of ill-gotten gains and then the warden starts wondering if he is living off of ill-gotten gains and did I mention that the young reformer and the warden's daughter ARE IN LOVE!?!?!&nbsp; Conflict!! So the warden is trying to figure out if he's doing a bad thing and the reformer is trying to figure out how to maintain the good opinion of his lady-love while prosecuting the hell out of her papa and the warden's son-in-law is trying to strong-arm the warden into standing up for his rights and then the press gets involved and everyone is quite overwrought. And that's sort of the whole of it.&nbsp;It is super. Cross-posted at books i done read. I think I liked the idea of this book more than the book itself. A gothic mystery/horror story set in Victorian London, featuring Charles Dickens and narrated by Wilkie Collins sounded like exactly the kind of book I would enjoy. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its fascinating premise and I was left with mixed feelings about it. Drood is told in the form of a memoir written by Wilkie Collins (a close friend and collaborator of Charles Dickens, as well as being the author of The Woman in White, The Moonstone and many other novels and plays) and addressed to an unknown reader in the future – that is, to us. The story begins with the Staplehurst Rail Disaster of 1865, when the train on which Charles Dickens is travelling crashes, sending most of the carriages plummeting over a viaduct into the riverbed below. Luckily Dickens is in one of the few carriages that doesn't fall. As he helps to rescue people from the wreckage, he encounters a mysterious figure dressed in a black cape who introduces himself only as 'Drood'. In the days following the train crash, Dickens becomes obsessed with finding Drood and discovering his true identity. With the reluctant help of Wilkie Collins, Dickens begins a search for Drood which leads them through the dark alleys and underground catacombs of London. Interspersed with the Drood storyline are long passages in which we learn about the family life and living arrangements of both Dickens and Collins, how much they earned for their various novels, their walking tour of Cumberland in 1857, the details of Wilkie's laudanum addiction, the story of the Swiss chalet given to Dickens by his friend Charles Fechter, Dickens' interest in mesmerism and every other piece of biographical information you could possibly want to know. Simmons also incorporates some genuine historical letters and quotes which adds some authenticity to the book. I can see why some readers might find this boring, but I enjoyed these sections – I thought the descriptions of Dickens' reading tours were particularly fascinating. Simmons has attempted to imitate Wilkie Collins' narrative style (including the Victorian habit of talking directly to the reader) but I felt that he didn't get it quite right. He also uses a lot of words and phrases that just sound either too modern or too American to me (the real Collins or Dickens would have walked on the pavement rather than the sidewalk, for example). This is only a small complaint though, as overall, Dear Reader, I thought his style was quite convincing. I do like the way the book takes us through the process of researching and writing The Moonstone . However, some important plot points are given away so if you haven’t already read The Moonstone and think you might want to, then I would suggest you read it before you begin Drood. It might also be a good idea to read The Mystery of Edwin Drood first (I didn't and kept wishing I had). Another thing I liked about the book was the way Simmons deliberately tries to confuse and mislead the reader - at several points in the novel we are made to wonder whether something we've just read is real or an illusion. This journey through the cemeteries, opium dens and underground sewers of London is a good atmospheric read for a cold dark night, but I was slightly disappointed by it and despite reading all 775 pages I still can't decide whether I enjoyed it or not! However, it will almost certainly leave you wanting to learn more about Dickens and Collins and their works, which can only be a good thing. If you like this type of book I would also recommend The Quincunx by Charles Palliser - another book set in Victorian England and written in a 19th century style. Before I come to the end of this review I would just like to say a few words in defence of poor Wilkie Collins, who happens to be one of my favourite authors. Simmons clearly doesn't rate Wilkie as a writer (I saw an interview where he described him as 'mediocre') and in Drood , the character is portrayed as a not very talented, second-rate author who is consumed with jealousy of the more successful Dickens and becomes increasingly bitter and unlikeable as the book goes on. I admit I'm biased because I've absolutely loved every Wilkie Collins book I've read; he was a much better writer than Drood suggests and definitely not mediocre, at least in my opinion! -Pictures of Charles Dickens (top) and Wilkie Collins (bottom) both in the public domain Helen Loves Books The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&nbsp; by Anne Bronte (1848-409 pages) The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the second and last&nbsp; novel written by Anne Bronte in her twenty nine years (1820 to 1849). &nbsp;&nbsp; Last month I read and posted on her first work, Agnes Grey. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is told in a very interesting way. &nbsp;&nbsp; It is a novel very rooted in its time and place. &nbsp;&nbsp; The book is divided into three sections and each is told from a different point of view and narrated in a different fashion. &nbsp; Part One is from the point of view of Gilbert, a well off farmer. &nbsp; A mysterious woman, a widow and her son, have moved into Wildfell Hall, a once grand mansion. &nbsp;&nbsp; Gilbert begins to court the widow, Helen Graham and loses interest in the woman his mother wanted him to marry. &nbsp; In a search for revenge, this woman begins to spread gossip about Helen. &nbsp; &nbsp; One needs to keep in mind that in the time and place of the novel a woman was not thought complete without a man and any single woman, widow or otherwise, above the age of twenty five or so was seen as a potential threat to the stability of the community and its morals. &nbsp;&nbsp; A friend of Gilbert's is also seemingly courting Helen. &nbsp; When Gilbert behaves in a jealous fashion, Helen gives Gilbert her diaries to read. The diary reveals her abusive marriage to Arthur Huntington. &nbsp;&nbsp; Helen begins the marriage completely in love. &nbsp; Over time Arthur seems to become bored with her company and prefers to spend his time with friends from his days prior to marriage. &nbsp; These friends lead him back into a life of heavy drinking and partying with women of dubious repute in the company of male friends. &nbsp; He becomes abusive to her and he tries to turn her son to his ways, teaching him to disrespect his mother and use improper language. &nbsp; In a move of extreme boldness for her day, Helen left Arthur. &nbsp;&nbsp; There some interesting twists and turns of the plot and throughout it all Helen behaves in a near saintly fashion, returning to her abusive husband to nurse him&nbsp; through a fatal disease. Part 3 begins when Helen leaves Wildfell Hall. &nbsp; We see Anne has kept some secrets from us. &nbsp; &nbsp; The ending is much like the ending of Agnes Grey . &nbsp; I liked several things about this book. &nbsp; I liked Anne Bronte's use of differing narrative modes for different sections of the book. &nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed the conversations in the book a lot. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall shows Anne was rapidly developing as an artist, compared with her first work. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall is one of the first novels showing a woman leaving an abusive husband. &nbsp; &nbsp; The abusive husband is a bit of a stereotype of the times (hence the name Huntington meaning he prefers the pleasure of the hunt to the company of his wife). &nbsp;&nbsp; You can see how deeply Anne felt alcohol was at the root of the problems in her marriage. &nbsp; She was very unhappy when her husband began to teach their son to drink. &nbsp;&nbsp; The novel is rooted in the time as there is no longer any great mysterious stigma that attached to a single woman with a child as there was in England in the 1840s.&nbsp; (Or perhaps one should say a single woman not of the poorer and majority class of people.) &nbsp; &nbsp; The world of women is a small one in the novels of Anne Bronte. &nbsp; She explores its limits very well. I read Wildfell Hall in part because I have decided to read all of the novels of the Bronte Sisters. &nbsp; There are only seven of them and I like feeling closure on a reading project. &nbsp;&nbsp; As I was reading I could not help but wonder if almost everyone reads her works mainly because of who her ates were . &nbsp; ("Ate" is a tagalog word for "big sister" that conveys for me the familial relationship between Anne and her sisters. &nbsp;&nbsp; A young sister or brother will call&nbsp; their older&nbsp; sibling "Ate Jane" and it is meant to convey respect for an elder sister.) &nbsp; &nbsp; Wildfell Hall is worth reading on its own. &nbsp;&nbsp; Her work does not have the power, depth and beauty of&nbsp; the work of her ates but not much does. &nbsp;&nbsp; I really thing anyone into the Brontes, the Victorian novel or 19th century women writers should read all of&nbsp; the Bronte novels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mel u The Reading Life &nbsp; click on poster for link to trailer Corey and I had a date night tonight to go see the new Alice in Wonderland movie. We saw in 3D. Alice is 19 years old and has dreams about the happenings of the original movies.... My thoughts are....... that it was just okay. We will not be taking the kids to see it at the theater. First and foremost, I think they would be bored. The beginning is very slow to get going and the plot would kind of be over their heads I think with her being rebellious about corsets and stockings, and then attending a party that turns out to be her engagement party. That doesn't ruin the plot I don't think. She eventually chases after the white rabbit and falls in the rabbit hole...etc., etc. It was very much like the movies I have seen before..just different looking. The plot is a little different but several of the same things happen, but with less "childishness" about them. My conclusion is that...it wasn't serious and deep enough to make it very interesting for adults, but it wasn't childish and silly enough to make it fully appropriate for children either. The gruesome aspects (stepping on human heads to cross a moat, monster eyes being plucked out by straight pins) make it just too much for little kids, so then the lack of more makes it slightly too simple for adults. I think it should have gone one more step one way or the other. It does look very interesting and beautiful. The 3D affects are great. There are some really funny parts with the Red Queen when she goes on her tirades, but I don't think kids would "get it." The March Hare is pretty funny. The Mad Hatter is typical of what you would expect with Johnny Depp playing that part. The White Queen is whimsical. There is a good message of good conquering evil and the Red Queen's demise. I even picked up on some easy to make comparisons between the overall story/characters/storyline and Christianity. Overall...if I were rating on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being Mystery Science Theater level and 10 being like Epic Life Changing Films...I would give it a ....... 6. I would watch it again maybe, the story is good because the story was already good, but it will be hard to find the just right age for our kids so we can watch it together as a family. Better versions of this movie have already been made, in my opinion the Disney one is the best because it makes me laugh a lot! Even though they said it is not supposed to be "the original movie" it kind of is. A good version, but disappointed because it could have been so much better. I think the fault lies with whoever wrote the screenplay. This movie completes my Victorian Film Mini-Movie Challenge. I didn't even realize it until I was posting on my other blog and saw the list of what I had already completed. Although most of this film is NOT set in the regular Victorian setting, it is for part of the time and the essence is there, even in Wonderland, or "Underland" as it is called in this film. Ok so, I read this a long time ago before I understood things like 'subtlety' and I was all, What?&nbsp; This isn't scary.&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real. But now ACK!&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real!!! So a bunch of people are sitting around telling ghost stories over Christmas (you know, as one does ) and this one guy is all, I have a story that will chill you!&nbsp; But it's at home and I have to send for it, so you can all go ahead and wait.&nbsp; And that's how tenterhooks were born. The story finally arrives and he reads it and its this governess who takes a position looking after two wee chillens who are beautiful and perfect and good and innocent (which is sort of freaky on its own, no?) except that maybe they are communicating with and/or possessed by some wicked ghosts.&nbsp; Because the governess keeps seeing said ghosts, who are apparently the valet and the previous governess (who got knocked up by said valet and drowned herself in the lake [allegedly]), and they appear to be trying to get the children.&nbsp; Except that whenever the ghosts appear, the children make a POINT of REALLY DELIBERATELY not seeing them, even though the governess is sure they do.&nbsp; It's pretty sinister. But then also maybe the children really don't see the ghosts because there are no ghosts because the governess is going mad?&nbsp; Because maybe they make a point of really deliberately not seeing them because they actually don't see them because&nbsp; they aren't there ?!?!?&nbsp; And the housekeeper doesn't seem them, even when they're right there but maybe she just doesn't have that ability?&nbsp; And I realize that I'm not making this sound very scary and loads of people read TotS and don't stay up nights but few things&nbsp;terrify my shit more&nbsp;than ambiguity.&nbsp; Except maybe sharks. I also feel like I should shoot you a disclaimer here and let you know that James is a mad&nbsp;over-commafier and no one thought to&nbsp;pelt him with&nbsp;periods, so his sentences get rull long and Victorian.&nbsp; Not like Lisa Appignanesi's do , to the point where you totally lose track 
f where the sentence started, but enough to exhaust the old temporal lobe.&nbsp; But I find him Worth It. Cross-posted at books i done read . Montmorency is a thief. A common criminal, doing time in one of Victorian London's notorious prison in 1875. But what makes him a different than many criminals is that he's very smart, and that he is lucky enough to have a benefactor of sorts -- a brilliant doctor who saved his life. While fleeing the police after a robbery attempt, Montmorency he crashed through a factory skylight and landed on an enormous machine, and would have died from his injuries if an ambitious young doctor hadn't wanted to use him as a test case. A year after his accident, following multiple painful surgeries, the thief who is known as Montmorency (an alias he has adopted, from the name on the bag of tools he was clutching as he fell) is routinely trotted out for meetings of the Victorian scientific community. He's prodded and poked like a laboratory animal, while the upper-crusties are treating him like some kind of rare zoo exhibit, Montmorency, a bright young man with an excellent memory, is actually studying them, and storing away all sorts of useful information. He's not stealing valuables items any more -- just valuable ideas.&nbsp; After one such exhibition, Montmorency absorbs up a very interesting piece of information: a map of the newly renovated London sewer system. Montmorency realizes that this would be the perfect escape route for a thief, and for the rest of his incarceration, he begins planning. He will use his burglary skills and newfound knowledge to reinvent himself as a gentleman. I really enjoyed this book. Of course, I'm currently fascinated by the Victorian period, but this book was both well-written historical novel and an exciting adventure/crime story. Though I personally would never have the nerve to burglarize, it's fun to imagine -- I do love heist movies and crime capers, so there you go. I think Upland did a good job imagining any plot holes and figuring out plausible explanations as to how Montmorency is able to pull off a double life as a Victorian gentleman (a trick in itself) and a thief that spends his nights in the slimy sewers of London without getting caught. He does encounter all kinds of setbacks and dangers. I do wish that Updale had given more details about the actual burglaries -- once it's established that he's a thief, she doesn't give many examples of the crimes, just the fact that he's a burglar. Also, she doesn't flesh out too much of his character -- Montmorency is so busy trying to reinvent himself, yet the reader learns next to nothing about his history, not even his real name. A little more detail would have been great. Since this is the first in the series of four, I suspect the reader will get more information in the later volumes. While I do recommend Montmorency , I have to point out that there is extensive discussion, especially in the beginning, about the filth of the London sewer system and everything that's in there -- and fairly explicit descriptions of the sanitation systems of Victorian prisons. If you have a weak stomach, you might want to skim those chapters. I like to read while I eat, but I would not recommend this book for mealtime&nbsp;reading until you get past about Chapter 13. It's short, only 233 pages, and a fast read. This volume of the Montmorency series is also available on audiobook, narrated by the wonderful Stephen Fry (aka Wooster from PBS' Jeeves &amp; Wooster). I've already put Monmorency Book #2 on hold at the library. Sadly, though there are several copies of the first book in my library system (which has 24 branches) they only own one of each of the remaining books in the series. It's too bad this book isn't more popular.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe if all the teens read it, they'll get hooked on Victorians and we'll have a whole new generation of lit lovers. This is book #4 for Our Mutual Read challenge. In some ways, this reminds me of Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky which is another instance in which the story behind a book is just as interesting as the book itself. My first online search for information about The Bondwoman's Narrative pulled up not information about the narrative itself, but an outline of events about Henry Louis Gates Jr's discovery and analysis of the manuscript, the proposed theories surrounding its authorship by Hannah Crafts (a pseudonym), and its journey to publication. Which admittedly is fascinating. I'd been unsure whether to include this Virago Modern Classic in this month's reading, but the story behind the story cinched the deal for me. As fascinating as it is, however, I became more interested in the story behind the story and almost forgot about the narrative itself; there are about a hundred pages of text before the novel begins and the introduction is engaging, but in its efforts to illuminate the various possible identities for Hannah Crafts, much of the story's plot is revealed along with abundant information about the actions of the characters therein. I would have preferred the introduction be presented as an appendix (but this is a pet peeve of mine, being so spoiler-phobic, and simultaneously being an orderly reader who would prefer to begin at the beginning and read straight through); but, the appendices are filled with their own interesting information (e.g. detailed description of how the manuscript was authenticated) so there wasn't much room there for more, I'd guess. So I read about 20 pages of the Introduction and then I jumped ahead to read the novel, and I jumped back to the Introduction when I had finished Hannah Craft's novel. butButBUT...the backstory is gripping and vital, contextually, to a more complete understanding of The Bondwoman's Narrative , so I am not actually complaining about this (even if it kinda sounds that way). Here's the thing though: forget about all the history behind it for a second... The Bondwoman's Narrative is a gripping tale. Apparently the author was heavily influenced by books like Bleak House and Jane Eyre (I've only read Jane Eyre of those two, but I'm not sure I would have spotted the connections, although scholars have pointed out many direct similarities between TBW'sN and these two texts) and there are all kinds of creepy and dramatic events that pull the reader into the story. A hatchet with hair still stuck to the heft, trees haunted by spirits still furious at their unjust treatment while alive, women driven mad, conniving business dealings (and, yes, this includes the business of human trade): this is not a dry, historical narrative, but a fantastic yarn. Nonetheless, a yarn with considerable import. As potentially the first known novel written by an African American woman, this novel is significant for being one of few of that time period that took the author's race as the norm. Unlike other narratives of that time period, which were sometimes even written under pseudonyms by white women pretending to write an "escape-from-slavery" chronicle (true abolitionists or simply opportunists who envied Harriet Beecher Stowe's incredible success with her 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin ), the black characters in The Bondwoman's Narrative are never described in stereotypical terms and the presumption is that characters are black, unless otherwise described. This is the exception rather than the rule for manuscripts dating to this time period, so it's certainly possible to read this novel for scholarly reasons, but too much emphasis on its importance might discourage readers who, if they just approached this as a 19th-Century Sentimental novel, might just find it a good read. Surely a book can be both: important and enjoyable. Anyone else read something lately that they were surprised to find themselves truly enjoying, even though they might have originally chosen the book because it was culturally or historically significant? I am running out of cliches to express how much Sarah Waters rocks me like a hurricane.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; She is amazeballs.&nbsp; When she is good, she is very, very good and when she is bad, she is still pretty damned good.&nbsp; Admit it, The Night Watch only kind of sucked because it wasn't Fingersmith . And to be fair, Affinity ?&nbsp; Also not Fingersmith .&nbsp; Ok but come on, you guys.&nbsp; SPIRIT MEDIUMS and SECRETS and spinster ladies who are recovering from the deaths of their fathers and then also something else horrible that they're not telling you about and also VICTORIAN LADY PRISONS.&nbsp; You would like read. Ok so.&nbsp; Margaret is a spinster lady who is visiting women in prison because that is the sort of benevolent thing ladies did in those days, to guide them in the ways of not being felons, and also&nbsp;so that the benevolent ladies didn't go stark raving mad while living at home with their mothers and being spinsters.&nbsp; Also, something horrible happened to her and no one is talking about it but everyone is mentioning it obliquely and&nbsp;glancing significantly at everyone else.&nbsp; Prepare to feel out of the loop. But then Margaret meets Selina, prisoner-slash-spirit-medium, and if you are at all familiar with La Waters you will be all I SEE YOU COMING, LADY ROMANCE!&nbsp; And if you are not, well, you have eyes.&nbsp; And I really want other things to have happened so that I can delineate them for you, but for the rest of the novel Margaret goes to visit Selina in prison and that is sort of it for&nbsp; many, many pages &nbsp;then something Fairly Unexpected happens at the end.&nbsp; So. And it is awesome and atmsopheric and there may or may not be spooks.&nbsp; Waters can toss a word salad like she was born to it.&nbsp; I...literally have nothing else to say about this novel.&nbsp; I'm going to start just putting 'ditto' for all of my Waters reviews.
