I've been enjoying so much new music lately that if I could find the time I'd have a song a day to post here. But given that I don't, I have to be content with once or twice a week, and in doing so I invariably skip over songs that I was enjoying earlier in the week. So, it's Sunday afternoon, and the sun is shining and the children are running around the garden in the hazy light that teases us with memories of summer. And this here is what is playing in my kitchen. A sweet, soulful, dreamy song that makes me feel as though we have all the time in the world. Hear more of The Low Anthem&nbsp; here . The second song 'To Ohio' is another favourite I have on repeat, along with the above 'Charlie Darwin.' There is also a gorgeous stop-animation official video to this too which you can see&nbsp; here , but my love of live music overrides even that, and I just had to post a live video. Hope you had a lovely weekend. Enjoy! Well, a few weeks ago I was alerted to the fact that my favourite shop&nbsp;in the world now has a&nbsp; blog . I can't remember when I first discovered&nbsp; Pedlars , it was certainly a few years back and may have been in an interiors magazine that I first saw it mentioned. Over the years, from the time I first received their lovely catalogue into my letterbox, although I would not necessarily have been a big spender, I have bought a number of things and poured longingly over many more. I'm not sure what it is they have that makes it so appealing, but I suspect it has a lot to do with their manifesto: Stuff We Love That You'll Love Too. In other words, they buy and sell stuff they they love, and they happen to have the most amazing taste in the world, which in turn makes it so appealing to the likes of me!&nbsp; One thing I immediately loved when I first flicked through their catalogue was not just the diversity of products, or the overriding sense of fun, or even the downright coolness of it, but the broad range of prices. Here was a shop that had divine lighting that cost hundreds, but they also had pocket-money stuff that not only could the kids afford, but that they actually really wanted! Of course a bit of investigating showed that of course they had lots of children themselves. And they lived in a beautiful house in the wilds of Scotland. As well as the most amazing holiday home &nbsp;which you can rent.&nbsp;And lots of dogs. And all I could think was, darn it, these guys have it perfect. (I'm sure they would laugh at that, but we have to have heros, don't we?) (By the way this is NOT the holiday home!) In their own words: ' we also have an organic farm in Scotland and a Christmas Tree farm, too. We have six children, four dogs, lots of horses and ponies and three chickens. We live in Scotland and in London and we have a fruit and vegetable farm in Wales. We are constantly on the look out for things that interests us.' Sigh... I love everything about Pedlars. They have amazing&nbsp; Vintage finds , fantastic&nbsp; homewares , brilliant&nbsp; fun stuff &nbsp;for all the family, as well as a&nbsp; music club &nbsp;that is right after my own heart. In fact there is so much more to see that I have to just recommend you take yourself on over there and have a look. And I do think&nbsp;what they are doing&nbsp;must be the greatest job in the world. Imagine! So if you get a chance do pop over and become a follower on their&nbsp; blog , and you never know but you might actually win one hundred pounds to spend in their shop! (Because they are very clever.) And even though it's lame to say I was planning to do this post anyway, ever since discovering their blog, and definitely before I did win that very amount yesterday, it is true. Honestly! Nothing &nbsp;more satisfying than finding something for next to nothing is there? Our local town recently had a new addition of a charity (thrift) shop! This is a very telling sign of the times and rather something as this particular well-to-do town is more home to the likes of up-market boutiques and I never thought I'd see a charity &nbsp;shop there. But there it is, and I have to say the quality is delightfully up-market! But of course. And even better, the prices are proper charity shop prices, unlike certain other ones who have been taking the you-know-what of recent years. So I popped in the other day with very little in my purse and no intention really other than to have a look. But I did spend. A little. This sweet cardigan is so perfectly Julia Childs that I&nbsp; couldn't resist it at just €3. I think it's the colour as much as anything. And although this skirt (for €5) doesn't look so great on a hanger, it's lovely on. It's years since I wore something so long and I bought it thinking I would alter it in some way, but it's too nice as it is!&nbsp; But then, part of my intention not to spend was because earlier in the week&nbsp; I had (fatally) gone to my favourite shop,&nbsp; Avoca &nbsp;for breakfast and as&nbsp; usual stopped to look at their sale rail on the way out. Shopping with friends&nbsp; can be bad for you. Persuasive friends. Friends who insist you try on that dress that made you gasp when you saw it, and then rave about how perfect it is on you...sigh... I am weak...I am. So I bought it. And, yes it was on the sale rail, but this is Avoca we are talking about...&nbsp; So I won't be telling you how much I paid for it, even when one friend was cheeky enough to ask them to knock a bit more off it (which they did!).&nbsp; It wasn't huge. It was less than €100. But still more than I would usually spend. But I had to. And I'm glad I did. Because it is just so lovely. A friend said it is like something out of Bagpuss, which is so apt because that is a world that still exists in my head. Some days I think in my head I am in that little shop: Bagpuss &amp; Co. It's perfect. A shop that doesn't sell anything. It's just a place for lost things... Take a little peep here. This is&nbsp;my childhood,&nbsp;this is all that makes me who I am today. I cannot think of anything that captures it better. Listen here for more of Danny And The Champions Of The World. Here's a band we've been listening to over the last week or so, and I really wanted to share this video with you. I don't think it's an official video, I think it's probably fan made. But from the first time I watched it I've come back to it again and again. Because it is just so incredibly moving.&nbsp; It's such an uplifting song, and coupled with footage that is simply people dancing, it somehow breaks my heart, in a good way. Dancing is such a human thing, and done with such quiet joy and confidence and honesty, with no self-consciousness, that it becomes a thing of great beauty. And watching it my heart is filled with such great love for humans. I can't explain it. But maybe one of you will get what I mean too. And even if you don't, it's a joy to watch, regardless.&nbsp; And do turn up the volume a little! I can't believe I haven't posted here about this band before now! Back in November I was thrilled to read that on the back of their new album,&nbsp; Midlake &nbsp;were on tour, and coming to Dublin. I was still feeling grumpy that I had missed out on no less than four gigs by bands I would love to have seen, so I was determined not to miss this and bought tickets the day they came out. I've been listening to the new album and it is just gorgeous, with echoes of English Folk that just rolls over you like warm water. I wondered if I would like The Courage of Other's as much as I loved their previous album The Trials of Van Occupanther which is on my list of Albums I Never Get Tired Of, and so far I am loving it. (The above song is from the Van Occupanther album). Have a listen&nbsp; here &nbsp;for some more songs from The Courage of Other's. So, that's where we'll be tomorrow night, and I'm looking forward to it, to a night of meeting and eating with friend's, a night of live music, of being transported away for the evening. Happy Valentine's Day to you all, and I hope you get to do something lovely, wherever you are! Update:&nbsp; It was amazing. They were brilliant. It really is something else to see seven incredible musician's up on stage, playing together like one fluid entity, each playing one unique layer of sound, yet knowing exactly where everyone else is, all in a perfect, seamless fusion of beautiful &nbsp; music. And they did &nbsp;take beloved songs and bring them to another level, and it was everything a live show should be. I have to say, the above song was one of the highlights for me. The drumming alone on this song was heady stuff, and just gorgeous. So, a happy girl I am. This will keep me warm for many weeks to come! And A Few Of My Favourite Things. I was never one for fashion magazines. Although if someone produced a Vintage/Thrift fashion magazine I would no doubt be a fan. The only exception might be the Irish magazine&nbsp; Prudence &nbsp;which is not only aimed at people who are broke, but it doesn't have a ridiculous price tag like most fashion mags do. I like that! This may be why I love places like Etsy &nbsp;and ebay. But of course that takes time to browse, something I don't have an awful lot of. Which is why magazines are great, I guess! I do go through phases of buying Interiors magazines when I need inspiration, my favourites being Homes and Antiques , and&nbsp; Living Etc. But my absolute, all-time-favourite, can't-live-without magazines have to be my monthly music regulars Uncut &nbsp;and&nbsp; Mojo . I just love to hide away with these and a cup of coffee&nbsp;for an hour or so and devour every word I can. It's never enough, but there is a month's worth of reading in them and by the time the next one is out I have just about finished it. And you get a free cd each month too. My favourite pages are the music review pages, which is where I find all sorts of jewels, both new and old, new bands, new singers, new albums, rereleases. It's all there. And if I like the sound of it I'll take myself off to Spotify &nbsp;to check them out. (Although sometimes you have to wait a couple of weeks for a new album to be available to listen to.) One thing I have discovered from reading these two magazines is the record label&nbsp; Jagjaguwar , which is host to some of my all-time favourite bands like&nbsp; Bon Iver &nbsp;and&nbsp; Volcano Choir . This months Uncut included a cd of songs from bands on this label, some of which I have heard of, some I haven't. And I wanted to share the one that jumped out for me, the one I am listening to on loop. From British Columbia,&nbsp; Pink Mountaintops. Their sound reminds me somewhat of&nbsp; Mazzy Star &nbsp;gone somewhat gospel,&nbsp;and someone else I can't put my finger on. Last year's album 'Outside Love' is just gorgeous. Have a&nbsp; listen here . (The title track in particular is sublime). So, let the middle of the week just slide right on by us. I am focused on the weekend, with the right kind of laidback sounds to keep me company. And plenty of reading material, which I've no doubt will furnish a number of posts here on ~Carnival~. Hope your week is going swimmingly for you too. And what might you be listening to? I have been entranced. Yet again. On loop in my kitchen, in my car, is 'July Flame', the new album from the lovely Laura Veirs. A number of years back my sister, Emma, gave me a copy of 'Carbon Glacier' which she had picked up in the US. I loved it. From the first listen. And the following year went straight out and bought her follow up album 'Year of Meteors'. When she played in Whelan's the week before Emma went back to the states for good, we went to see her, sat right up the front, and I cried at least twice. She was amazing. And yes, I was emotional about saying goodbye to Emma. But Laura Veirs rocked. In a sweet sort of way. So, when I read the reviews in my favourite music magazines, Mojo and Uncut, and words like enchanted, suffused, and mysticism were used, I just had to check it out. And it didn't disappoint me. As I said. I have been entranced. And the inclusion of the likes of Laura Gibson and the mighty Jim James of My Morning Jacket just sends me into raptures! There is hardly a wrong note on the whole thing. Laura is on tour at the moment, though I was very sad to read they won't be coming to Dublin this time. But seeing as Laura is very pregnant I figured it wouldn't be fair to make a fuss! Do check out her&nbsp; blog &nbsp;over on her website. And while there you can have a look at some of their other&nbsp; videos &nbsp;too. You can also listen and buy her (six) other albums, as well as a recording of a young French choir who recorded nine of her songs, the result of which is a strangely moving experience. If you think you might be interested you can also listen to more from Laura Veirs&nbsp; here . And read reviews or download songs&nbsp; here . I so wish I could post the track called 'Little Deschutes' here for you to listen to. I am listening to it as I write, with goosebumps. It truly is sublime. But the album is so new I haven't found it anywhere that can post here. So have a listen if you come across it. ' I wanted to make something sweet, The blood inside the maple tree, the sunlight trapped inside the wood, make something good.' Nothing like a weekend away, is there? As I mentioned&nbsp; over on Milkmoon , myself and Jay managed to escape for a long weekend to visit some friends, Marta and Sam, in Madrid. And as everyone knows, there is nothing better than having someone who knows the city for finding the best of everything! So, there was endless wanderings around the streets of Madrid, and on Saturday myself and Marta took ourselves off &nbsp;and we found a number of vintage shops which I was very excited about. And let me say, the prices were amazing. This sweet dress was €18, and it's in mint condition. I am loving tweed and plaid at the moment, and I couldn't resist this rather school~mistressy kilt for €10! It's 100% wool and so warm , which was just what I needed as we traipsed about in the snow. And this gorgeous leather bag which we both admired in the window, Marta bought, and then gave to me (sweet thing that she is!) was €5.95!! I love it so much! I could have filled an entire suitcase with fabulous finds, but as we were restricted both financially and in terms of baggage I had to limit myself, sadly. But I am already planning my next trip, hopefully in June for Finn's 12th birthday. I promised her a Mum~and~me trip somewhere, and I think it might just be Madrid! With two empty suitcases...
