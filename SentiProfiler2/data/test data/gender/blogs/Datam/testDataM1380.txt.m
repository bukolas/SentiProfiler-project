Super Star Rajni next movie "Enthiran" with ace director Shankar and his dream crew has begun shooting recently......So i thought let me put my insights about the movie and do Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat(SWOT)  analysis about the movie....I dont want the readers feel that i will be biased in doing this analysis as i have a penchant for Rajni....i assure that it will be done in a neutral manner...

STRENGTH:
The greatest strength of the movie is Rajni-Shankar-Rahman combination,this combination has been a great success in "SIVAJI" and they proved their mettle in that blokbluster.Technical crew for "enthiran" is one of the strong points for the movie.....Ratnavelu for cinematography,anthony for editing,Yuen Woo Ping who handled stunt for many Hollywood movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Matrix and Kill Bill has been roped in for "Endhiran".

WEAKNESS:
Writer Sujatha's demise is one of the weakness for the movie.....He has been instrumental in Shankar's success since "boys"...It is also believed that story of enthiran was written by him...One of the weakness of "sivaji" was it lacked a coherent story,the same can be repeated in Enthiran....Aishwarya rai  roles in recent movies except "guru" were very lackadaisical....Hope shankar provides a meaty role which has a scope for acting.....
