Others might have thought Iâ€™ve gone bonkers but it was something I had already set my mind on. Of course, there was some anxiety on my part as I would be traveling alone but I braved through it and trusted my guardian angel to be by my side during the entire trip. Traveling alone on unfamiliar surroundings seemed a dreary thought but I shook my apprehensions away and readied my belongings.My friend who generously took me in her LA apartment for five days volunteered to bring me to the Union Station. We dragged my heavy luggage as we took the subway at downtown LA.
