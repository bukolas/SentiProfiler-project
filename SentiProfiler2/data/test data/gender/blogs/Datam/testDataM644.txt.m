he is one of my best friends. a very cool attitude. a pure cine buff....(just like me). u would love to be in his company as he is very friendly and jovial. both of us share the same name and also our likes and tastes. he is a die hard fan of DADA and AJIT KUMAR. has got real practical brain and i will not be surprised if he starts a business of his own in another few years. overall one of the few friends of mine who will travel with me till the last stop in the journey of life.
