If I’m being completely honest, I’d have to say that my quest to cut down on my multitasking has really been in vain. I really just don’t think it’s in my nature to only do one thing at a time. I try, but I get bored or I feel guilty that I should be doing more. My addiction to technology doesn’t help either and neither does that the fact that I’m a workaholic. I mix work with play all the time & play with work. Not to mention trying to fit in family friends in between errands and new projects I start.

I came upon this whole goal of reducing multitasking thinking it might cut down on my stress, but I think it’s making me more stressed thinking about all the shit I have to do! Added to the stress factor, I also heard a few reports on NPR about how multitasking can make your brain less effective, but so does a glass of wine and I’m not giving that up!

Oh, why can’t I be happy doing less?  I have these notions of mediating and being more in the moment, but both of those things just seem to yet another thing to add to my to-do list.

What about you? Am I along in this quest or are you all struggling with the idea of trying to lead a simpler less harried life only to be thwarted by yourself? I am on the search for a virtual intern for Summer 2010.

Responsibilities will include:

   1. Conducting research for stories.
   2. Help me coordinate a variety of projects—which will mostly involve contacting artists, scheduling & organizing details.
   3. Respond to email!
   4. Writing assignments…both assigned and those based on your own interests.
   5. Other stuff that comes up.

Workload will be about 8-10 hours a week and there is absolutely no pay, but the glory, oh the glory…

If you are interested, email me at jen@indiefixx.com with a brief note about why you are interested in being my intern and a resume as well. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone who may be interested.

For a student, I’d be happy to write a letter of recommendation after a successful internship. I’d also be happy to promote projects that the intern may be working on personally.

I will collect resumes until May 15th and get back to those who I’d like to interview after that. Please note that this is a virtual internship, so your location does not matter, but you must be super self-motivated.
