Hi my pals! I was just visiting one of my best pals Tweedles at "Through the eyes of Tweedles " . I do love Tweedles and she got an award and she passed the love to me. I am so lucky! Please go and visit Tweedles and see the wonderful pug pin she got and is wearing proudly. Tweedles and I have many adventures with our magic bubbles. Here are the rules: 1. Publish it on your blog, referring the friend who passed it on to you. 2. Share 5 things you like to do. 3. Pass it along to keep the circle growing. Here are 5 things I like to do. 1. Sleep with my Mommy, all snuggled in right next to her. 2. Eat, I would eat all day if Mommy would let me(which she doesn't) My favorite is cheese. 3. I love to go for walks with my Big Sis and Dad 4. I love to protect my family 5. Play, I love my squeaky toys for playing and stuffies for snuggling. I have so many friends it is so hard to choose.

I will be expecting you on your magic bubble or will you be coming on the beautiful Owlbert ? licks and sniffs, Sasha I was just being curious, that is my defense. I am sitting by the back door watching for squirrels. Mommy has let me out on the deck before and I always come right back in with her. She went out to do put a cover on our outside stove cooker griller thing and I decided it was time for me to explore the lay of the land. I wanted to see the backyard on my own, I am a big girl now. Come on Mommy please let me out, I won't do anything sassy (giggles and paws crossed behind my back) Just open the door and you will see how good I am. As soon as she opened the door, down the stairs I went. Our backyard leads to something called a 'marsh" I don't know what that is except that it is wet back there. I decided to run like the wind to the front yard. Mommy had to run to try to catch me and with her bad back, she couldn't run too fast. By the time she caught up to me I was in the road in front of our house barking at some kids on skate boards telling them to knock it off. Mommy caught me there. Why was she so mad at me?? I was just being curious. Now I can't go out by myself at all and I am grounded, so no parties for me for a while. I will try to change her mind, cause turkey day is coming and I don't want to be in trouble for that. Can you talk to her?? Please???? I am not exactly sure what grounded is, but I know she is pretty mad at me and I don't like that at all. licks and sniffs Sasha ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ p.s. can you send treats, I think grounded means no treats, shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sasha really scared me when she ran off and especially when I found her in the road. I know better then to ever let her out there without a leash again, but in the past she has been very good and stayed with me on our deck. Lesson learned and don't worry she is still getting plenty of treats. Anne Please go and visit Bozo at Pet pride for more pets doing fun stuff! Bozo also keeps track of birthdays and lets us know who to celebrate with. Some days , you just don't feel like getting up. Have a fun and lazy day. licks and sniffs, Sasha p.s. Mom wants me to ask you to visit her Comfort Food blog and check out the cookie recipe exchange. Ok so I did and now I'm done and back to sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Hi my pals. When I had my recent trip(nightmare) to see the Vet Lady, Mom found this article. Some of you may already know about this. You can never be too careful with us pets. The Vet Lady said it would be ok to give me a baby aspirin(81mg) if I needed cause my paw was infected. "Tylenol and Your Pets ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a pain killer and anti-fever medication commonly taken by people for minor aches and pains, fever, and soreness from arthritis. It is also a common ingredient in many children’s cough and flu medications. Because it is so regularly used in humans, most people believe that it is safe for their pet. This is incorrect. Tylenol is extremely toxic in cats, and can be toxic to dogs as well. Cats are more frequently affected because they lack an enzyme pathway that functions to metabolize the drug properly. As little as ½ tablet of Tylenol can be fatal in cats, and although a higher dose is usually required to be toxic to dogs, many can get severely ill with a low dose. Tylenol causes damage to the liver as well as to the blood cells in both species, and clinical signs can include depression, rapid breathing, dark colored gums, swelling of the face, paws, and limbs, vomiting, drooling and death. The safest way to avoid potential fatal reactions from Tylenol is to NEVER give it to your pet, even in very small amounts. Keep all bottles of Tylenol or other acetaminophen containing products in a securely closed cupboard or medicine cabinet to avoid spillage. If you think your pet is in pain, contact your veterinarian before giving any pain medications at home. It could save your pets life!

There have been no problems associated with grape seed extract. Onions and garlic (raw, cooked, or powder) Contain sulfoxides and disulfides , which can damage red blood cells and cause anemia . Cats are more susceptible than dogs. Garlic is less toxic than onions. Xylitol (artificial sweetener) Can cause liver failure. Mushrooms Can contain toxins, which may affect multiple systems in the body, cause shock, and result in death. Macadamia nuts Contain an unknown toxin, which can affect the digestive and nervous systems and muscle. Chocolate, coffee, tea, and other caffeine Contain caffeine, theobromine , or theophylline , which can be toxic and affect the heart and nervous systems. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ With the holidays coming, we need to be careful and try not to get into some of the people foods that could make us sick. Cheese however, seems to be just fine, thank you very much. Be safe and lets stay healthy! licks and sniffs, Sasha Hi my pals. It was kind of boring around here this weekend. My Daddy was sick and of course I was on duty to take care of him. He didn't feel like playing with me. Here I am making sure that he stays calm and rests while he was watching football on Saturday "Stay down Daddy, I am here to take care of you. Do you think Mommy could bring us some get well cookies?"" What Daddy, you don't feel like cookies?" Thats ok , I will be happy to eat them for you." It is a very hard job taking care of sick peoples. I can't wait until Daddy can play with me again. He plays the best games with me. I love my Daddy. I hope you all had a nice weekend. I am getting very excited for Thanksgiving. It is my favorite meal of the whole year. What is your favorite food on Thanksgiving?? Mine is mashed potatoes... yummm . The Wisconsin Badgers beat Michigan!! Congratulations to Brutus and the Ohio Buckeyes for their great victory! licks and sniffs, Sasha Hi my pals. I am trying to go to sleep and I am thinking about the things I might dream about. Sometimes I have bad puppy dreams and make woofy sounds and kick my legs(Mommy says). I hope I don't have one of those tonight. I would like to dream of a place where all my doggy pals and all my people pals can live together and no one ever gets sick. We will have such fun, running and playing. In this magic place there will be lots and lots of cheese and no shots and no sickness. I will call this place " Sashacheeseland". Will you come join me there? Free cheese for all! Cheese...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Here is another little joke I got from another Uncle, I hope it makes you smile. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -The Silent Generation are people born before 1946. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -The Baby Boomers are people born between 1946 and 1959. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -Generation X are people born between 1960 and 1979. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Generation Y are people born between 1980 and 1995. Why do we call the last one generation Y? I did not know, but a cartoonist explains it eloquently below...I Learned something new today! licks and sniffs Sasha Please visit Bozo at Pet pride for pictures of pets and pals all over the place. I am feeling a little dazed here after my Vet Lady ordeal, but even still I agreed to pose for a photo. Well Mommy was holding a piece of cheese out, so that was my focal point. After my horrible haircut experience, they had the nerve to put a shirt on me. Even though I wasn't feeling well, it only took me 2 minutes to work my way out of it when I got home. Here I am half way off. If you roll around I find it slips right off. licks and sniffs, Sasha Please visit Camera Critters Meme to see oodles of fun pictures of all kinds of animals doing all kinds of stuff. Hi my pals. I am feeling better today. I was pretty sick for a couple of days. The Vet Lady said it was a reaction to the shots and also the infection in my system. Well if the shots were gonna make me sick, why did she give em to me?? I don't know about that shot thing anymore. I am better and back to my old sassy self. Here I am feeling down still. Pay no attention to the back round. I am in a room that is being fixed up and changed and all that. I am trying to gather enough strength to play with my favorite squeaky hot dog . After that I went back to sleep. For the rest of this post I am going to show you a nice walky I took with my Big Sis before the dreaded haircut and "shots". The first one is a picture of the house where the meanest dog alive lives. Her name is Bridget. I would have Big Sis take a picture of her, but I am afraid the camera would explode with her ugliness and melt and dissolve. Ahhh a lovely morning walky. Ok, back home. I need to go in and check on Mommy. I can't stand to be away from her for very long. She needs me. Ok anytime now. My Mom is in there and more important my good girl treat awaits. Thank you for all of your good wishes, I love you my pals. licks and sniffs, Sasha
