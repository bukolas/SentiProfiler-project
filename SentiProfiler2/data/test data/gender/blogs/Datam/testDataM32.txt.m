Change!!!
Its been almost five months since i graduated and started work and here i am now, at a standstill...Life seems to be in a pause phase at the moment. 
Its strange how you change from a teenager to a grown up in such a short period of time, all cos of a simple fact that now i am on my own..lol..sounds strange doesnt it...It was much clear back then as to what, where, how etc,...but now life seems slower than it ever was. 

Theres this strong urge in me to be someone, to do something and show the world but then again, the fear and the insecurity within makes me feel even more vulnerable and weak. 

Sometimes i find myself over excited and filled with positive energy and optimism and other times i am like, comparing myself to the better ones and saying wow, am i even getting there...i guess the more i compare, the more i pull myself down, well thats when i am jealous..but otherwise it kinda motivates me to do even better.
Sometimes i feel great about myself but many a times, especially when i am with others, i find myself comparing myself with them for every little things...i guess its gotta do with the insecurities that has build up within me over a period of time..may be the past..lol...Anyways i gotta work on it...after all, its the change within that can change the exterior circumstances isn't it...Anyways as for now, i have to do my laundry and i hate it..

Meanwhile you take care and happy surfing!!!!
