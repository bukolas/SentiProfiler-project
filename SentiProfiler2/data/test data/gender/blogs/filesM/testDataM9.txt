Terrorism. global warming, natural disasters, the economy .....troubles ahead.....worry, fret, stress; the constant struggle to compete.....to keep up.....to survive. This is modern reality for the vast majority of the American population. We are constantly sensually bombarded; seem perpetually connected; almost universally psychoanalyzed; and thoroughly medicated.
AUSTIN, Texas - Twitter CEO Evan Williams on Monday announced @anywhere, a service designed to make it easier for Twitter content to be directly incorporated into Web sites.The announcement was part of Evans' keynote interview at the annual SXSW conference here. The @anywhere service is designed to make it easier to use the service without using twitter.com or a client app like Tweetdeck."Users will be about to follow their favorite columnist or writer directly from the publishers' site," Williams said. Currently, the process of following someone requires a Twitter log-in.
To cut a really long and winding short story, I was discussing the celebrated and illustrious Indian Premier League and the chances of Delhi Daredevils against Mumbai Indians in the match that was going to be held that day only in saddi Delhi. My dear friend refused to budge from the fact that DD was much better than MI. The discussion finally ended (after he and I had divulged all the strengths of our respective teams) with me and him betting on our preferent teams.
At IX Marks Liam quoted a few times from Spurgeon which made me realise that I haven't read any Spurgeon for a sometime. Why I would neglect something that is soooooo beneficial to the heart, soul and head is beyond me. Just a few pages in on his Soul winning book and I find this gem of a quote:We do not go out snow-balling on Sunday's, we go fire-balling, we ought to hurl grenades into the enemy's ranks.
California Natural is one of the best dog foods available. It has the shortest ingredient list of any dog food... chicken (or lamb), rice, sunflower oil, and vitamins. Great for dogs with food allergies as it limits the number of ingredients used over all other dog foods.Transition with the chicken and rice to settle the stomach (and make back yard cleanup easier,) then alternate flavors every once in a while as the lamb and fish formulas are great for skin and coat.
The SPY has now beat its all time record by two days, and there is nothing to say that it can't continue. But I think odds are there will be one down day between now and opex. There is no way to no how much down it will be but you have to tkink that people are starting to get nervous and are itching to book some profits. I think there is still room to the upside but I would think further upside would be healthier if we could digest the move of the past few weeks. I mean we are up 12% from the recent correction.
Well I have been working on a lot of thing. Finishing up the semester and trying to get my master degree program started as well as my freelance, but i am always working in 3D on something else. Here is something that I made last night in ZBrush. The Hair I am sure about, but i will more then likely change.
The next Reformation truth to explore is the Sovereignty of God.  The absolute supremacy of God over all of His creation and His creatures.  The absolute control of God over His creation and creatures is known as His providence.  God is God and does what He pleases. These are some of the truths that must be explored.
 WCF 2.2- "He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and hath most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever himself pleaseth."
This really was a movie worth seeing. For me, there are some movies that really take me somewhere, and this was one of the movies. The scenery and photography is excellent, and the soundtrack complements the movies, terrificly. When you finish the film, you feel that you left your own life for a short while, and took a lil journey worth taking.  I am a big fan of action scenes and war scenes( when they are well-done),and this movie has that coverred. I really enjoyed the fight choreography, and how they integrate skill, intelligence, and strateg yinto the fight scenes, creating a realistic vision of the ultimate warrior.
What's up, my peoples? Granted, I shouldn't have started my first review of a product with "what's up" but it's part of my personality. I decided to write a review of the iPhone because I have always wanted to write a solid review of a product for people to read and because I don't see a lot of reviews written by African Americans. Don't get me wrong: I read and respect all that write reviews or what-nots but I want to see more reviews by African Americans once in a while. This site will hopefully be a medium for such reviews.
i can put my money and coins everywhere...YEAH!!!!i will not be waken up by him in the midnight anymore...WooW and no longer to see his lazy face.. well, i have just finished my trip in Genting..
i think my next post will be something about that.don't think that i always play around and don't study at all,
if you really think so, you are wrong!!Anyway,
wishing you all have a nice day in every single day,
at least you could able to find some happiness from someone,
and thus make yourself happy.

So then I'm a swan flying off into the sky and then the credits pop up...I never watch credits because I'm hardly ever interested in the actor...I'm more interested in the character that they played...but Bobbin had an interesting voice actor, so I watched the credits to see who voiced him (a one-hit wonder, I guess). And ka-pow there he is (I mean Card of course) right there on the screen. Script something or other...it was really cool...because I was thinking of him before and then there he was...like a dream come true...or something like that.
The World Wide Leader has finally acquired rights to broadcast the Barclay's English Premier League (that's soccer for you neophytes). ESPN had twice bid on arguably the most famous league of the most famous sport on the planet and it looks like the third time's the charm. The massive branch of the Disney media conglomerate will pay £250 million ($408 million) for the rights to 46 games for the 2009-2010 season and 23 for the following three seasons.The EPL, home to such powerhouses as Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal (go Gunners!) is one of Europe's infamous futbol leagues along with La Liga in Spain, the Bundesleage in Germany and Serie A in Italy.
Coast is a great sushi restaurant in the Damen/Armitage area of Bucktown.  The atomsphere is relaxed, modern, and dark and the sushi is top notch.  The only minor downside is that it's BYOB, and we never remember that.  Of course, there's a liquor store a block away if you need to snag a quick bottle of wine.
I did a lot of thinking about my business today. I got very close to taking the first step. I am not sure still. I think I need to finish this book I am trying to get through. It is basically about this kind of stuff, so I might learn something important. Jesus Christ! I thought I was just overreacting last time I complained about my parents watching movies to loud, because I have been watching my movies pretty loud too. But what the fuck. They are going to knock the fucking house down. Seriously, it is fucking 11:30pm and my brother is trying to sleep so he can wake up at 5 for school tomorrow. They have the volume way too loud.
I just finished reading Rainbows End by Vernor Vinge and I recommend it. It is science fiction in the style of Gibson's Neuromancer series or Stephenson's Diamond Age but less cyberpunk. In Rainbows End, Vinge describes a near-future which includes augmented reality and life-changing medical advances.
United Services Auto Association (USAA) is far and way the best insurance company in the world, bar none.I guess that's a bit of hyperbole. But I can't think of any organization I have dealt with that is more entitled to a rave.I became a member of USAA when I was an officer in the US Air Force in the late 1950s. 50+plus years has given me ample opportunity to test the performance of USAA. They have never let me down.
i don't even look good touching one.
lol in other news my wrist is feeling better after the fall at 4F 2 weeks ago. should be back on my bike soon its driving me crazy cause i cant. you should go check some of these sites even though its not like my blog gets any looks any ways
There is a recent trend sweeping the diamond ring world and this can be a trend that enables newly engaging couples to save a lot of money - as they may need to since they are young and since at the time of this writing the economy has taken a sharp downturn that looks like it will last for a little bit longer - but, still be chic and not ever have to worry about any stigma about being "cheap".
Man...this car rocks! Push button start...automatic everything...the only downside was the speed so I upgraded mine to the 350 with exhaust and man is it one crazy ride...I still want to test drive the ISF...Anyways, bottom line= lexus engines are the best and this ride gets a lot of compliments.
XM Satellite Radio, with its over 130 stations (most commercial-free) can appeal to anyone, but it has real appeal to those of use who do some long distance driving.  you know, those drives that leave you hitting the scan button on your AM/FM radio looking for a signal, any signal that will pierce the night. 
There's hardly any sport that isn't better on horseback.  Hockey on horseback? It's called "Polo."  Instant win. Horseback riding on horseback? Even better. But no sport could benefit more than figure skating. How many times have you seen the same dips, backwards skates and triple jumps? Boring. Now imagine all of that... But on a horse. Everything old is new again!
Last May, I wrote a two-part series entitled "Understanding Apple." (Part 1, Part 2) In it, I pointed out that, as someone who has followed the company extensively since 1981, I'd developed a pretty strong understanding of the way it had operated over the previous 27 years. I've also spent a lot of time with Apple's management team over the years, developing a pretty good understanding of why the company does what it does.
the city i live in is bisected by a beautiful river. i cross it two times every day. the otonabee was once a wild river that the first nations used to travel through this region. later, it drew the early settlers to its side because it provided not only the necessary liquids around which all life inevitably gathers, but also because it provided a source of energy. energy to drive grainmills and woodmills. many cities began their lives this way.
I have been going to Dr Michael Marcus for at least 5 if not 10 years.  He and his office are fast, efficient, thorough and completely professional.  The hygenists are very well trained and remember me from appointment to appointment.  They never make me wait and I am always out of there in one hour.
No, I didn't put those in the wrong order. As many people know, I have collected every incarnation of Star Trek ever seen on the screen, both large and small. However, there are definitely some I have not had the time to see. I decided to correct that, and start watching them all. I watched the first episode of Enterprise tonight. Unlike my recent attempt to go back through the original series, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, this was the pilot, so not everything worked smoothly. The actors need to learn their characters a little, and definitely need to work on their chemistry. But I found the plot engaging, and the effects decent. I enjoyed watching some more flawed characterization. It is logical that humanity had a ways to go from where we are now to where we are by next generation days, but I had not seen it on film before.
Blizzard is one of the few companies that has consistently offered Mac versions alongside its PC releases. While a beta is ostensibly a chance to stress-test the servers, and thus it makes sense to concentrate on the platform with a larger audience, some Mac users have felt a bit put out by the long wait. The beta is expected to end in late spring, making the two month gap for a Mac release a pretty substantial chunk of available time. Still, Blizzard is committed to making it happen, when most developers don't bother with the platform. As the old saying goes, better late than never.

I am writing this post as I am in an Enterprise Architecture class, specifically on the Oracle Enterprise Architecture Framework (OEAF).  I have been a long believer that SOA’s key strength is that it is the first IT approach that blends or unifies business and technology.  That is a common view and is certainly valid but is not completely true (or at least accurate).  As my personal view of EA is growing, I realize more than ever that doing EA is FAR MORE than creating a reference architecture, creating a physical architecture or picking a technology to standardize on.  Those are parts of the puzzle but not the whole puzzle by any stretch.
As I read about the massive earthquake this morning in Chile and the resulting tsunami, my mind raced with prophetic thoughts. Then I went to the Word; I wound up in I Kings 19.Perhaps it is wise to wait for that Still Small Voice that He will surely send to us if there is more to this or if there is something we need to know. That is not to diminish the power of this event or its possible prophetic significance.
ust a quick LOST-related thought. I think that most discussions of this season have neglected key insights from last season, such as that Widmore and Hawking may both have been acting in order to prevent the death of their son, Daniel Faraday. As far as Widmore can tell, the attempt was unsuccessful. And so perhaps he has gone to the island not to kill the smoke monster but to capture him and to make a deal. He wants his son restored to life
There is no place to hide from God- not in the heights of heaven nor in the depths of hell. God finds us. In the light or in the dark; In the open air or in the womb; God knows us, loves us, and helps us- guiding us, holding us fast. When doctors do not know enough, God knows- for He made us. Not one cell, one molecule- not one atom or subatomic particle-- that makes us who we are is hidden from Him.
Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion is the best computer/game console game ever known to man. I got hooked on the Elder Scrolls Series starting with Morrowind about 3 years ago and still enjoy playing it now. Oblivion starts where Morrowing ended, but its is a totally different world with different objectives and charaters plus if you get the Game Of The Year Edition you get 2 bonus expansion packs with it. You get "Knights of the Nine" and "Shivering Isles".
The session began quietly for me. On my brow and temples I felt a pain on the right side of my head. It was strange and only bothered me during the session while on my head. Michelyne felt short zaps of electricity particulary on my brow. Also on the temples I felt like I was squinting my eyes light one would from a bright light. I didn't really notice any colors.
As a last thing, I was handed late last night the two books of award winners in comics and in prose from the Philippine Graphic/Fiction Awards that Fully Booked and I have been sponsoring for the last 5 years. They are really solid, good-looking books I'm proud to have been a part of helping to bring into existence. They'll be on sale tonight -- but only after the award winners are announced (because the winners are in there and we don't want to give it away).
This story now in it's last season5, chronicles the city of Baltimore from 4 distinct angles.  The Street, the Law, the Jgovernment, and now the Media.  It shows how all are intertwined. It is a robust offering and packs plenty of power. 
Final Fantasy XIII is finally out on PS3 and Xbox 360. Square-Enix’s newest adventure eschews the visiting towns/talking-to-people/choices focus of the previous games in the series in favor of a new battle and story-heavy system. And whether you enjoy it on the PS3 or pretend it doesn’t bother you that the Xbox 360 version is terrible, you’ll have a lot of free time on your hands watching those FMVs and hitting those “Auto-Battle” commands. So while you’re waiting, why not play a drinking game?
Take A Shot Every Time You promise yourself the game will get better than this. You run straight. Someone says the word “hero.” You read the Datalog to understand what the hell just happened. You look at the box to make sure it’s actually a Final Fantasy game.
Has literature got a flavour? And if it has, what does it taste of? When I first read Salman Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children', I felt the same way I do whenever I have my favourite brand of crisps: Kettle Chips. I call them grown-ups' crisps: mature, intelligent (none of that half-full/half-empty pack shenanigans like Walkers') and addictive. Same with Salman's fiction. It's full of a silliness that is trascendental and lyrical at the same time. He clearly has fun writing, ergo, I have fun reading him. And I have fun, too, eating Kettle Chips.
The Apple iPod Touch 3rd Generation is a calendar, PDA, and many other things. Of course the fact that it can do these functions ,music/video/movie/audiobook/mini-computer, makes the perfect business helper. They're so convenient and user freindly that everyone can use it very easily.It can be used also as a storage unit to transfer files from iPod to computer. You can check your email using Wi-Fi.
In my last post, http://jahaines.blogspot.com/2010/03/performance-tuning-101-what-you-will.html I talked about performance tuning queries that appear to be well tuned.  There are a lot of optimization techniques available unbeknownst to most developers that do not require indexes or radical code changes.  These are the optimizations that I will be talking about in this post.  There is absolutely no way I could go over every possible optimization technique available, but I will do my best to present as much content here today, and will make future posts on other techniques.
The most striking thing about Cozumel right now is the hurricane damage, and seeing what's been repaired and what hasn't. Cozumel is actually on a small island just off the coast of Mexico, and bore the brunt of last season's storms. At first, much of the island looked like old photos of post-war Europe, with only the skeletal remains of buildings standing. We found, as we got closer, that there was a great deal of construction going on trying to refurbish these large buildings (you'll need to click them to full-size).
Nice moon , is it ? While I was waiting for my friends to reach the car park of my school , I saw this big moon ! haha ... luckily i brought my tripod , so i can take a nice moon photo ! :)
This is Chap Goh Meh , the last day of Chinese New Year , in China today was valentine day . :) like previous year ( last year ) , we went out for dinner , the different was this year we didn't go to temple after dinner .
No other country, with a history of successful education, applies economic principles of competition and incentives to the teaching profession. It’s too narrow-focused. There are so many other variables to consider. Community, family, individual differences. Schools are not factories. No other nation, with a successful school system, abandons courses in cultural subjects, like music and foreign languages, to focus only on basic skills and testing.
I haven't posted about music in a while, but here goes. So, I'm cruising through iTunes, building a playlist of 'essentials.' There are some songs that I just have to be able to listen to whenever I want. Here, in no particular order, are a few of them. 1. Jet Airliner, by Steve Miller. (i love the joker and fly like an eagle but hear them too much) 2. Heart of Glass, by Blondie. (the original not the funky disco one *must* have the word ass or wph wtp) 3. Life in the Fast Lane, by The Eagles. (this is prolly #2 on my atf list)
Hey all you Sunnydale Alumni, ever wondered whatever happened to your classmates? Ya know, since that whole "Hellmouth" thing? Man, those were bitchin' times. Well, you're in luck, because Timeout New York has you covered.The Buffy the Vampire Alumni Event promises to party like it's 1999. And you won't have to run for your life! Organizer Clinton McClung has lined up an evening of trivia, Oscar-style video tributes and even a "Class Protector" award for the best dressed costume, presumably.
I am a big fan of the zombie apocalypse genre, probably because it usually features lone individuals finding each other and joining forces to survive in a hostile environment filled with mindless infected masses.  I love playing the computer game Left 4 Dead 2 and I enjoy watching zombedies such as Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead.
Due to high work load in my day job, just a quick update. My picture at istockphoto fell through - AGAIN! Can't deal with it right now though. Will do later. I now claimed a few blogs on technorati, as you know. Turns out, now I have one more thing to worry about. There's something called technorati authority. This is a measure of how important your blog is in the blogosphere of that topic. So now I have to build technorati authority.
Honda Accord is a a great car. this is the first car i owned and i am really impressed by the looks, performance, durablity and and the long lasting engine. This car is really a worth for the amount spent in its class. you can use it for 200,000 miles (two hundred thousand miles) without much trouble and maintenance required.
When it comes to choosing diamonds, there are many aspects to consider, but most gemologists consider the cut as probably the most important feature when it comes to a gemstone's appearance.

A diamond can have perfect color and clarity but will suffer in value and appearance due to a poor cut because of its dulled appearance.

The cut determines a diamond's brilliance or how light enters the gemstone. A diamond with an ideal or excellent cut grade proportions will return the maximum amount of light to the viewer's eye, making the gem appear more brilliant and beautiful as a result.
oh, The breakfast flakes sprinkle on some paradox ...hear one happy bird a perceived delight!

When I was a young boy my Grandmother came to live with us for a while, and she loved the soap operas on the radio. I can’t remember the names of them but there was One Man’s Family, but every day she wanted to listen to those. This was a prank as a young boy I would set up the phonograph so when she came in to listen, instead of the soap operas coming on, the theme music for drag net would come on and she wouldn’t know how to change it. So she would have to come get me and I would change it back.
I bought it for my friend daughter. I have two Britax car seats, the Decathalon and Roundabout.  These car seats seem to be the safest on the market.  I feel incredibly comfortable putting my children in these seats and they seem to provide the support in all the right places.  I also love how incredibly easy these are to clean.  I take them out every so often and vacumn them out completely and they look (almost) new.  The belt is very smooth moving, especially when you press the button to give you more belt when strapping the child in.
Had this for awhile when a key part broke. The customer service had to be pushed to perform, and pretty disappointing.
At one point in my life, I literally thought that you must be insane to pay for audio programming...why pay for something that is available for free on any AM/FM radio?  That was until all of that same AM/FM programming became very stale and I became annoyed with what seemed like endless commercial breaks.
Let me say from the start that I work for Sprint and get free cell phone service. If I didn't work for Sprint (which will be the case very soon), I might easily make a different choice for a cell phone. However, I wanted to get a new phone and didn't want something as bulky as a Blackberry or even the Palm Pre. Most of my cell phone use is for simply making and receiving calls, so I wanted something that was so easy to carry that it was almost like it wasn't there.
I love this show sooo much. its very interesting and the charecters are real and great.  it was nice seeing richard dean anderson again.  he is hilarious in this series.  I like michael shanks, he is good looking and his charecter is a total stud.  Amanda Tapping and Christopher (teal'c) are also great actors and they all get along great on the show.  i just love the concept of the stargate show, love it love it love it.  recomend it!
Harley-Davidson has developed some exciting bikes since they became employee owned, teetering on the verge of bankruptcy in the mid-eighties. What a turn around for the company, from just about out of business to a lean and mean organization that has case studies written about the excellence of its management for use in prestigious business schools.
This winter, as we all gathered at my parent's to decide what excursions (onshore activities) we'd be signing up for, we all decided that today would be the day that we do something as a group with my parents. After all, they were paying for everything, and neither of them were planning on the snorkeling/caving/speedboating activities. So we decided to take in a Mexican folklore show, and then just kick back and check out the shopping and eating and everything else we might find.
As I sit here late at night I mourn what I have lost. I have perhaps mourn what I have lost for too long. It seems as life moves forward I keep glancing in the rearview mirror to mourn rather than look forward to what is to come. This has crippled my life. I have stopped to gaze into where I have been rather than charge forward to where I am going.
After days of rain that dropped 5-8 inches in the Boston area, the sun is out, the waters are slowly receding and it's beginning to feel like spring! These beautiful crocus blossoms greeted me at my side door this morning as I was leaving for the office - I'm pleased to share them with you.
Saint Patrick's Day! I totally forgot. That is really sad since I am 50% Irish and almost 50% Scottish. I have no cultural identity. I am just a lost soul who has no culture. I think maybe the one thing that I inherited from my Irish forefathers is anger problems, but that is a different story. I didn't wear any green, I didn't do anything to celebrate. I am surprised I even thought of it at all. I guess its because my Mom cooked a Corned Beef and it smelled so Damn good. The green tablecloth also helped. Otherwise I would have probably gone throughout the entire day without even having a clue.
Toxic people living in toxic environments leave toxic waste. Hurting people hurt people. In update New York there was a toxic parcel of land called the Love Canal - it is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls where 21,000 tons of industrial waste was buried and built over. The original canal project to connect the two sections of the Niagara River in the 1800's was abandoned.
The Heavy Rain game is more of an interactive movie, in which a bloody origami is found near dead people, which suggests very interesting paper-y things happened to them to make their Facebook status a frowny face for a long time before they finally died.
i like it services. very polite and sweet stewardess and steward. they very friendly on my last flight they made me laugh and do did i.the only thing is i never got air miles for my tickets . i don't know if i can.i think it should fly new places . cause is worth flying jetblue. big planes , lots of space and lots of farts along the flights.laughing my ass off. but hey who don't lay one.here or there.
The other aspect is of course personal but with my wife and I both doing reiki, this makes for some interesting dinner conversations. I must say that our relationship over the same cycle as my improvements in general mood has also improved. I guess a good way to put it is that we feel more kindrid. yes that's it. Laughing and doing as we please. That's a good thing.
This first day of school is a little different than the dozens of others I've experienced. Winter 2008 marks the first semester that I start the advertising major at BYU, and it feels good to finally have a focus in school. Today has been a day mostly of standing in lines for various reasons, but I did manage to get some required reading in for my marketing research class. So far, the text has not lived up to its price ($153.) My first class starts in about an hour, goes for about 2.5 hours, then I have the wonderful commute back to the salt lake valley after that.

Last week, a friend said to me, "Are you excited about Vancouver?" And I looked at him blankly, desperately trying to remember when this new movie Vancouver was coming out and what the plot was. Don't make my mistake. Vancouver is a city in British Columbia. British Columbia is a province of Canada. Canada is basically part of the United States. Just kidding about the last part.
While more of a performance tweak than an actual sequel, Rock Band 2 is still the best music game on the market today. The game comes with over 80 songs on disk and 20 free songs with a special code in the instruction booklet. The game is also compatible with nearly all songs from the original Rock Band with the purchase of a minimal licensing fee. New songs are made available for download each week. The song selection is widely varied spanning multiple genres from country to black metal.
1. gentle crescent moon

Coast has become one of the best sushi spots in town and is no longer just for folks living in Wicker Park and Bucktown.  We love the "White Dragon and Volcano Rolls" which set Coast apart from other creative sushi places in town.  If you like signature rolls, you must try Coast!
In 1970 I got out of the Navy..... and at that time met my soon to be wife Deborah she was a school teacher. One year later we were married. For the next 2 years Debbie was teaching high school so that I could go to culinary arts school to become a chef.
The color and texture of facial skin reveals signs of aging. If you look carefully in the mirror you will probably see variations in pigmentation, particularly in the cheeks, forehead and around the mouth, and your skin may have a rough appearance with large pores and a dull finish.The Obagi regimen will remove the outer keratin layer of skin (the layer of dead cells which has not yet fallen off), and will also blend the pigment in your skin, giving you a more uniform color rather than blotchy multiple colors. The overall effect is a smoother, brighter, younger appearance.
There are a few possibilities for this problem. The first one is that the little switch that is behind the burner knob either went bad or got water in it. To isolate the switch that is the problem you can pull one of the wires off of behind the burner knobs one at a time till it stops. That one is the one that is bad.
Men and women who have excess fat deposits and loose skin in their abdomen and who find it difficult to lose the excess fat through pills, exercise and dieting opt for abdominoplasty. Women who have had multiple pregnancies and stretched abdominal muscles and skin and are unable to return to their original shape can also choose abdominoplasty.Women planning to become pregnant should not go for abdominoplasty, as the muscles in the abdomen would expand during pregnancy. People who have had any type of abdominal surgery should not opt for abdominoplasty.
couldn't believe it when I heard that Naseem soa is teaching kids of all ages at his residence. My first thought was "how could any parent take their child to him?". Are we so out of touch with what is right and wrong that we think everything is OK? What does it say about us as a society?My next thought was why the concerned authorities are allowing this to go forward? I hope that their response would not be that there are no laws in place to keep such offenders in check.
This is the best car I've ever had! No probs beyond routine maintenance. It's tall enough to see over traffic, and fast enough to zip through it smoothly. It's a bit narrow - can't rest my elbow on the window ledge as I was used to - but I can live with that. Mileage is great for a traditional vehicle: 23-26 mpg. Cargo capacity is remarkable, too. The back seats can be folded down or removed. A neat added feature are the hooks in the back for hanging grocery bags.
Software developer VALVE had a couple of major announcements earlier this week; the first of which was that there is going to be a sequel to the critically acclaimed Portal released later this year, and the second was that the company's game distribution service Steam, as well as many of its games, will soon be coming to Macs. While the latter may only make a small sect of gamers happy, the former should put a smile on the face of anyone that has escaped the Aperture test facility in the past. To honor these big announcements this week's Auctioneer is all about VALVE, and the games that they've brought us.
he wireless industry is a notoriously tough nut to crack, and it's become pretty clear that the first iPhone wasn't about total domination so much as priming the market and making a good first impression with some very dissatisfied cellphone users. With the iPhone 3G, though, Apple's playing for keeps. Not only is this iPhone's Exchange enterprise support aiming straight for the heart of the business market, but the long-awaited 3rd party application support and App Store means it's no longer just a device, but a viable computing platform.
Heard a song today called Unfaithful. Not sure who sang it originally but Rhianna does it now. It's about a girl that is unfaithful to her lover. Seems like I lived my whole life like that. Not a single girl being even the least bit faithful to me. They all cheated on me. It's a good song. I can actually say I sympathize for the lover in the song cause I went what he went through every single time.

My niece is starting to show new actions that show her evolution from baby to actual child. I watched her today move her car seat to the little table and place her little pooh bear or baby as she calls it into the seat. Then she placed a bowl of little gold fish crackers in front of it then walked over and sat down in her own little chair that my father built and started eating from her own bowl. She would get up occasionally and take the little wet cloth that we used to clean her face with and use it on the "baby" to clean its face with.
Let's face it, most of the newest car innovations fit a family about as well as a studio apartment! While Ford never says so, the innovations designed into the Reflex concept make it look like they were designed with family in mind. A hip sporty family, that wants to go green, but a family.There are the reverse butterfly doors which make it easy to get in and out of front or back, and mean a parent is no long bumping into the door installing a car seat, or buckling baby in. And speaking of car seats, it comes with one; built right into the rear seat. When is the last time your car came with one of those?
I survived the day. Had a hard time waking this AM but made it somehow. Work was interesting had a headache most of the PM, wonder if it was Caffeine as I had a coffee this AM and then a Pepsi. Had an instant ice pack on neck and shoulder most of afternoon. Was told by a couple of people should go home. Told them kinda hard with no sick time left and they just looked. If they only knew. I made 3 out of 4 metrics on Friday and 2 out of 3 for week. Pretty sure am off to good start for this week but who knows. Better yet who gives a shit. really,.
This game was a blast. You (as Drake) start the game waking up in a train that is dangling over the side of a cliff. You have to climb up the train car, which is slowly teetering off the edge of the cliff, ready to plummet miles down into a snowy abyss. From the snowy beginning there are flashbacks to what led Drake to this predicament. The story unfolds in a very cinematic manner, and the scenes in between levels, while a bit clichéd by Hollywood standards, are still just as good if not better than your average brainless Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis action movie. In fact, the cheese is part of the fun and I would venture to say it's intentional.
Stopped by the post office this morning to pick up a package on my way to the lab. I thought it would be as good a time as any to clean up my desk and at the very least make it appear that I am more organized than I really am (seriously, it's a mess). It's pretty nice here on the weekends, it's quiet, there's less worry of disturbing undergrad classes if I do any experiments in the daytime.

Anyway, it turns out the t-shirt I ordered from Concrete Rocket arrived! Here's how the design looks:
I had pretty bad vision since I was in 3rd grade.  About 5 years ago, after watching many people around me get Lasik, I decided to take the plunge.  Because this was an elective surgery that in rare cases, could cause damage to my eyes, I decided to find the absolute best doctor for the job. I chose  Dr Coleman Kraff and he was amazing to watch.  Very confident, poised, fast, and focused....well like a laser.
This camcorder is really good for the price and it has an easy button for people who are not good with camcoders. There is also a touch screen in the camcorder ang you can turn the screen so you can see yourself. It also has a built in lens cover and you don't have to worry about lossing it.
At the time Debbie and I moved to Rapid City  our family started to grow by one boy and four girls. I'd like to introduce You to my "little kids". On the top row starting left to right, my son Brian and my daughter Leslie. On the bottom row; left-to-right, my youngest daughter Shelley, my eldest daughter Christy and my next eldest daughter Suzanne.
They are all adults and they all live in Rapid City.
Ideally, the process for buying a laptop would involve a single question: "Which laptop should I buy?" The answer would then spring forth from the heavens or your favorite technology Web site. Unfortunately, finding the right laptop for your budget and needs involves answering not one but a series of questions. Fear not, laptop buyer, we know which questions to ask, the answers to those questions, along with the current market trends and where laptops are headed.
Slept until 11am. Time change seems to have no effect. in fact filled my tires with air and went for a bike ride around the complex like 5 times. Legs were hurting so stopped and came inside. Time change no effect as of yet but being cautious. Feeling pretty up and positive. Need to get gas for car and then run a few errands. Laundry is going to wait again. Goal for next week is to complete all of it. It is at least in a semi organized piles and ready to be washed. Need to find a laundry shop to complete. Also need to register for IML volunteer and start working on getting taxes filed and the $5,000.00 medical bill from last hospitalization. That is approximate including Doctors which I have yet to receive. Funny they are charging me over $3,000 for the CPAP. that is the price of a new machine. I plan on fighting that charge to see what happens. Will be using health advocate to see what, if anything can be done. Last night did not sleep right away so created contracts for my support system alerting them if what they should be on the look out for and what actions to take if they see me doing those actions.
Yesterday we had dense fog, heavy rain last night and fog again this morning. It is supposed to transition (whatever happened to just saying "change"?) to rain beginning around ten this morning. And yes, today is the day we load carts onto the Bookmobile, unload them, reload them, unload them, reload them -- all day long. This will be my first experience dealing with that in the rain. I understand that we have some flimsy tarps to put over the carts, but the word is that they are not all that helpful. At least it is supposed to get up to about 53 (11.6 C).
Remarkably inventive, animated masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki who has been responsible for 3 or 4 of the finest animated films I have ever seen and at leas half a dozen excellent ones as well.Spirited Away is the best known and it has been dubbed by a well cast group of English speaking actors so that you will not need to read subtitles to enjoy this new classic.
I haven't decided quite what I'm going to do with them yet. I might try a short game using Rattrap's Broadsword Adventures, or else I might try running a solo RPG scenario using one of the old school D&D clones, probably Labyrinth Lord, along with the Mythic GM Emulator, which I just recently picked up and which looks fairly interesting. Either way I'll most likely post the results here.
To start off, this thing is basic when it compares to other portable music players on the market.  It doesn't have all the thrills and frills that some portables have.  It doesn't have the video capability, it doesn't have touch screen.  What it lacks in aesthtics, it completly makes up for in funtionality, ease of use, portablilty, as well as over all relaibility.  The size first off always amazes me that something so tiny can hold so much.
I live to bash Al-Farouq Aminu, so bash him I will.  The only chance Wake has of winning this game is if they do it in spite of Aminu.  The kid is – amongst many other things – garbage.  You sit there waiting for him to assert himself until you realize he can’t.  Three words to describe Aminu: uncomfortable, disconnected, and content.  Similar to how I want you to be aware of my Turner love, I also want you to fully understand my Aminu hate.  I’m as low on Aminu – pause – as I am high on Wall.   
Yes, observers of the Kansas City Rights Voting Rights Massacre know about Mr. Hearnes and his work behind the scenes in our sister city, St. Louis and across the nation.

The article also talks a great deal about the REAL ID act. Missouri State Rep. Jim Guest (R-King City) is a national leader in opposing Real ID. Yet for some reason, the anti-REAL ID forces in Jefferson City didn't see the threat of voter ID laws.

Clearly the governor's office is aware of the issues. Matt Blunt was Secretary of State during the 2004 election. His chief of staff, Ed Martin was former chairman of the St. Louis City Board of Election Commissioners.

Yet where does the buck stop in the administering of Missouri's elections? The Governor? The Secretary of State? The County Clerks? The Board of Election Commissioners?

Yes and No. Welcome to the Missouri's segregated election system with anti-machine politics protection. Missouri's system is a result of Jim Crow laws and anti-Pendergast "reform" efforts.

Sigh. The work of reform is never done.
I was looking for a small, inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts at the gym. An i-pod seemed a bit too costly for what I would use it for, so I checked out mp3 players on eBay. After doing my research, the Samsung YP T9 J seemed to be the way to go. It's small, has multiple features and is much less expensive than an i-Pod. I purchased a refurbished 2GB model on eBay for less than $50. 4GB models are also available for a bit more. I didn't think I would need anymore than 2GB at the time of purchase.
So, I have now seen about 9 Enterprise episodes. I am actually really enjoying this show. It does have a different feel than many of the Star Trek shows. I feel the characters are more realistic in their human reactions. We have also watched half the first season of Gary Unmarried. This is a pretty funny show. My wife says, except for his life situation, I am very much like the main character. Apparently sarcasm and a biting wit are how I communicate. No argument from me, I guess....
I was wondering if any of you follow specific fat burning and muscle building programs? If so do you follow programs that you found online or do you follow programs that are sold in stores or shown in magazines or books? Where exactly do you get your workouts from, if you even follow them that is? And what programs have worked the best for you as far as muscle building?Also I was wondering what you have tried that has helped you build muscle as far as supplements and programs - as I am trying to compare and test against the best muscle building and fat burning programs.
It was a curious Minister's Bible Study I held tonight. Several of the great "poles of opinion" came up (yet without contention). One of the group said: "How should we think about these things? Healing, predestination, women in leadership -- and totally different views?" I said, "My closest friend in ministry [he has since emigrated] held the opposite view to me on women in leadership -- and he still does. I think that God smiles on him with humour, and says, 'I'll show you ...'" One of the group interrupted me, wagging a finger: "I'll show you a thing or two!" I said, "No. 'I'll show you what wonderful things I can do through you, in spite of your quirky views.
