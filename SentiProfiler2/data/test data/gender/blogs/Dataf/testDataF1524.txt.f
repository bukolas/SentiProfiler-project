That one day, the world will change, and people will start realizing how beautiful life really is. I pray that one day the world will be rid of liars, cheaters, and thieves. &if not rid of, than those people will see that their actions actually do affect others. I pray that their eyes will be opened, and they will start to feel the way that God feels toward His children. I pray for the rid of ignorance and foolishness. I pray for the rid of selfishness. I pray that God's hands will protect the hearts of the ones who live for Him, and pity those who never believed. I pray that God will bless those in need of strength and courage. I pray no punishment. But I do pray for the people who need to get what they deserve. I pray that people who don't care, will start to. And people who do care get what they need out of everything. Life isn't about wanting things for yourself. It's about loving those who you easily provide for. Materials are nothing without the feeling of loving what you have. The thankful feeling you receive when blessed by things that you love. I pray that anger will be lifted off of my shoulders. I pray that God will give me the strength to lift my head up and walk with positive energy. I pray that God will give me the strength to forgive those who I feel I cannot forgive, and help those to forgive me for the wrongs I've caused upon them. &I pray, that one day God will help me believe that this is all worth it, and happiness is really obtainable.
