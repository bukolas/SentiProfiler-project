Arrived in Stockholm all smelly and hungover. Got back in the game with some beer on my brother's sunny balcony.
My family drove up from Varberg to celebrate my sister's 20th. The birthday girl herself was hungover and tired, but the rest of us were happy bunnies.We ate, drank, walked, laughed and did the kind of stuff our family generally does. My brother took great joy in trapping me in revolving doors, my dad told rubbish jokes and we overdosed on garlic.
 haven't been to Stockholm in the springtime since I was a toddler. I was born there, but my family moved down to the westcoast quite early on. But I still have the same relationship with Stockholm like I would with a hometown. Hatred mixed with passionate love. The accent can drive me mad, I get sick of having to correct people when they assume I'm from Gothenburg, but every time I leave I feel like crying. It's odd. I still don't think I could live there for any longer amount of time, but I do love that city. Love, love, love.
 And this time round I got to meet lovely Anna for a coffee and discussions about love, life and everything, which made me happy.

I'm back home in Edinburgh now. It's so much warmer here, no snow, and plenty of spring flowers. I've got a horrid headache and loads of uni-reading to catch up with. I guess I should get round to it.
