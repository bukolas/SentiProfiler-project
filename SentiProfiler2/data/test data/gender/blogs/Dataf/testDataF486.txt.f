I have a special place for Tibet in my heart — especially since one of my dearest friends is a Tibetan. And I think that it’s quite a strug gle for Tibetans today try ing to find their iden tity wher ever they are in the world. It’s not easy when your home land is no longer yours. Or that you can no longer even “visit”. And that the only images you can see of your home land are the ones you see through films that make their way out of the bor ders. I can’t even begin to think what it feels like for the Tibetan community.
