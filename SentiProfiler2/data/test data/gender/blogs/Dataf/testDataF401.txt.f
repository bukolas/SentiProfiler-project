In 1765 the curate of Sahuayo consisted of four villages; Sahuayo, San Pedro Caro, Santa Maria Asuncion de Xuquimatlan and San Miguel Guarachita, with Sahuayo being the main village. During the War for Independance (1810-1821) the Sahuayenses sent a large contingent of men who fought to defend the island and port of Mezcala (now Lazaro Cardenas) from Spanish warships. The Hacienda de Guaracho sided with the Spanish and was attacked several times by the insurgents.
