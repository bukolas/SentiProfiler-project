I have a surprise in store for you. Where's Prozac When You Need It? The phone rings. "The Bistro," I answer, "How can I help you?" "What kind of cuisine do you serve?" a female voice asks. "Northern Italian madam." "And what's your sushi special tonight?" I pause a moment. "We don't serve sushi madam." "Why not?" "Because we're not a Japanese restaurant?" The caller thinks about that for a sec. "Do you serve tuna?" she asks. "We do." "Can't you make sushi out of that?" "No." "Why not?" she asks incredulously. "Because." "Oh." There's a long pause. I can visualize this woman sucking her thumb. "Would you like to make a reservation?" I ask "No, I really wanted sushi tonight." "Sorry," I verbally shrug. "Could you suggest a place?" she asks testily. I give her the name and number of a very expensive sushi house and hang up. I look at the clock and sigh. So far I've put in eighty hours at the Bistro. When Fluvio comes back this Sunday it'll be 110 hours without a break. Phone calls like this threaten to destroy whatever sanity I have left. It's time to self medicate. I go to the back and fetch a can of my new best friend – Red Bull. "Cocaine in a can?" Gerald quips as he walks by. "I can't afford the real thing," I deadpan. "The dumpster dealers will cut you a break," Gerald says, referring to the criminal element that delivers behind restaurants everywhere. "Never did that stuff actually," I reply. "A couple more of these double shifts and you will be," Gerald observes. "I'd settle for some Prozac," I say, "Got any?" "I'm fresh out." "Damn." I go back to the front and start reading The Times. The Red Bull kicks in. Great. Now I'm wide awake borderline psychotic. I try and lose myself in the Dining In Section. There's a good article about aperitifs. I crack up when I get to the part about Cynar, a liquor made from artichokes. Sounds disgusting I know but it's quite good on the rocks with soda. We have it. No one orders it. Hmmm. I wonder how that would taste mixed with Red Bull…………. Gerald interrupts my reverie. "The lady on 26 left her credit card on the table," he says handing me the checkbook. I look at the folder. Not only did she forget her card – she forgot to sign the receipt and leave a tip. "Was this woman drunk?" I ask. "I wish she was," Gerald replies, "she and might have been less of a bitch." "What was the problem?" "You know the type," Gerald says drolly, ''water with lemon, chicken Caesar spilt, and three hours of prattling with her friend." "You can retire on checks like that," I observe humorlessly. "You'll take care of it?" Gerald asks. "I'll lock up the card," I reply, "maybe she'll come back for it." "Ok." Two hours go by. The lady doesn't come back. I call the credit card company. "Hello, Credit Card Company," a pleasant voice chirps, "How can I help you?" "A patron left her card behind in my restaurant," I say, "Could you call her and let her know we have it?" "What's the number on the card?" the rep asks. I rattle of some digits. "Thank you sir," the rep says, "that card has now been deactivated." "Wait a minute," I yelp, "I just wanted you to call the woman and tell her we have her card!" "I'm sorry but its procedure to invalidate a card when it's reported lost or stolen." "Could you at least call the lady and tell her she left her card here?" I ask. "I'm not allowed to relay messages to a card member," the rep drones robotically. "But…." "Please destroy the card." "But…." "Destroying the card protects you and the customer," the rep continues. "But…." "Thank you for calling the Credit Card Company. Have a nice day." Click. Gerald comes back up to the hostess stand. "Were you able to get a hold of her?" he asks. "I called the credit card company and they canceled the card." "Why didn't you call information and try and get her number?" Now why didn't I think of that? Maybe because I'm exhausted. "Too late now," I say. "Try anyway." I call information. The name on the card is unique. Of course they have her number. I ring her up. "Hello," a professional voice answers. "This is %-&amp;%- at The Bistro. You left your credit card here." "Oh yes I know." "I'm sorry but I tried to have the credit card company contact you and they invalidated the card." "WHAT!!!!!!" the woman shrieks, "I just got that card!" "I'm sorry. I should've tried to call information and find you. But my first impulse was to call the credit card company." "THAT WAS THE WRONG IMPULSE!" the woman yells. "Well it's been deactivated for your protection." "You're really stupid," the woman huffs. "Well madam," I reply angrily, "you left your card here, didn’t sign the bill, and forgot to leave the waiter a tip. I don't know you. What would you have me do?" "Now I have to get a brand new card!" the woman moans ignoring my tirade. I look at the name embossed on the card. It has the letters Ph.D on the end. "Pardon me," I ask, "are you a psychologist?" "I'm a therapist," she says, "Why?" "Just satisfying my curiosity," I murmur. The woman hangs up violently. I hope she wasn't with a patient. Then again I feel bad for anyone she's treating. I cut up the card into tiny pieces and dispose of it. Gerald returns. "So what happened?" I tell him. "So I don't get a tip?" he asks. "Something tells me you weren't getting one anyway," I reply. Gerald laughs. "Fuck her." I echo the sentiment and return to my paper. I look at the clock. Monday will be my first day off after eleven double shifts. I can't wait. Phone calls like this don't help. I'm burnt out. I start praying for a blackout so I can close early. Of course it doesn't happen. I'm not gonna make it three more days. I better get some Prozac soon. They should start putting it in Red Bull. Hmmmm. Now there's a million dollar idea. Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net ! Attention Loyal Waiter Rant Readers! Waiter Rant is going to be down for maintenance for a short time today. The changes I hinted at earlier are coming soon. I have worked 70 hours so far this week without a day off. After I get some rest (and time to write) I'll post more new stories. Baby Bucks I'm tired. Fluvio went on vacation and I'm stuck minding the store. I've got seven more double shifts till he comes back. I'm worried. It's only Sunday and I'm already punchy. There are bags under my eyes and my cheeks ache from maintaining the customer friendly smile. My feet hurt. Every customer is becoming an obstacle to overcome. I dread the phone. Waiters constantly harass me with problems. By the end of the week I'll probably be psychotic. The Sunday rush ends. The last tables are finishing their espressos. Soon the Bistro will be empty. I look at the clock. Fifteen minutes till closing. Thank God. I want to be in bed before midnight. I start doing my cashout. I'm wondering why the drawer is short ten bucks when the door chimes. A youngish guy stands in the doorway. Damn. "Can I help you sir?" I say cheerily, but my heart isn't in it. "Can I get a drink and some take out?" the man asks. The guy looks familiar. I spin through my mental rolodex of faces. Ah, there he is. Dan something or other. Cute wife. He proposed to her in my section two years ago. I stuck the ring on a piece of tiramisu. Now they're expecting their first child. Tempus Fugit. "How's your lovely wife sir?" I ask, smiling at the memory of his spouse, laden with child, sweating like a pig in the July heat. "She had the baby earlier this evening," he replies with a wan smile. "Congratulations!" I offer. "Thanks." I can’t help but notice this guy doesn't look entirely happy. "Mother and baby are both well?" I ask carefully. "Yeah they're both ok. Jen was in labor for twenty four hours." "Yikes" "Now she wants Porcini Risotto from her favorite place," he says. I groan inwardly and pull out my dupe pad. I have to let this guy get some food or my soul will burn in hell. The kitchen guys are gonna be pissed. "So one Porcini Risotto. Anything for you sir?" "Just a Ketel One on the rocks." "Coming right up." I put the risotto order in over protest and get the guy his drink. "Here you go," I say handing the man a frosted highball glass. He scarfs the vodka down greedily. "Want another?" I chuckle. If I just had a kid I'd drink too. After a short pause New Dad replies, "No I'm good." "Well it'll be twenty minutes until your entrée's ready. If you want another let me know," I offer as I return to the cash drawer to find my missing ten bucks. I start counting but stop. Something's not right. Even with my back turned I can feel the tension coming off this guy in waves. I'm emotionally attenuated I guess. Chalk it up to my years working in a psychiatric hospital. I turn around. New Dad's knee is bopping up and down nervously. His discomfort is making me anxious. I decide to intervene. "So did you have a boy or a girl?" I ask. "A girl." "You poor man," I say winking. "Tell me about it," the man sighs. "God has an exquisite sense of justice sometimes doesn't he?" That provokes a laugh. "You're right," the guy agrees. Now you might think my comment's inappropriate but it isn't. Whenever men undergo a major life event, like getting married or having a baby, we guys tend to respond with a certain gallows humor. For example, my brother, on his wedding day, had to walk down a long dimly lit corridor to reach the main part of the church. As we groomsmen walked behind him, ostensibly to keep him from running away, I was reminded of a line from a movie. I couldn't help myself. "Dead man walking!" I cried out. The guys cracked up. The minister cracked up. My brother smiled nervously and walked to the altar to await his bride. Now he's married and sipping beer on some beach in Maui with his beautiful wife. My point? Sometimes a little ribbing helps soothe a guy's anxiety and snaps everything into proper perspective. Usually. "And then there's dating. Oh man…." I continue saying to New Dad. The guy's laugh's smaller this time. Actually he looks like he's about to throw up. Ok, so maybe gallows humor isn't the way to go. A quiet minute passes. The guy stares at the floor. He take a deep breath like he's about to say something. He doesn't. The clock ticks. I see moisture in his eyes. "You'll be fine," I say gently. The guy wipes his face quickly. "Yeah I know," he says, "but there's so much to worry about. I mean summer camp, private school, college. You know what college is gonna cost in eighteen years?" "No idea." "A million bucks!" he explodes. "That much?" I wonder skeptically. "And then there's braces, toys, broken arms," New Dad gushes as if a dam burst from within I recognize what's happening. When New Dad held his baby for the first time the enormity of what's happening hit him. He's trying to process it all at once. I don't have kids of my own but I have friends who do. I've seen how they've handled it. I know what to say. I hope someone says it to me when my time comes. "It's a lot of stuff but you'll break it down into small steps and it'll come together," I offer quietly. "I guess," New Dad says. "Think about everything at once and you'll go nuts," I say, "just remember, one day at a time." "Your right," New Dad exhales. "Enjoy your little girl. She's only a baby once." I finally see a real smile. "She's beautiful," he says. "I'll bet she is." "You have kids?" New Dad asks. "Me? Hell no. I just have joint custody of a dog." "You'd be a good father." I feel myself blushing. "Thank you sir." "How old are you?" "Thirty seven," I reply. New Dad is about ten years my junior. "Well, be sure you have them before it's too late…" "Sir," I say clasping my hand on New Dad's shoulder, "one of the great things about being a guy is we can still make babies twenty minutes after we're dead." New Dad emits a soul cleansing laugh. "I have plenty of time," I reassure him. "You're a funny guy," New Dad says. "I try sir." The food's ready. I slip a tiramisu, gratis, into the bag, run the check, and take the order to New Dad. "All set sir," I say, "and since your wife likes tiramisu so much I threw one in on the house." "Thank you," New Dad says shaking my hand. "You're very welcome." The guy signs the check and leaves. I watch him walk off into the night his life changed forever. That kid's gonna be all right. When I open the checkbook and my exhaustion dissipates. On a thirty dollar check the guy tipped me fifty bucks. Totally unexpected. As I close up the Bistro I can't wipe the grin off my face. Baby bucks! Ka-Ching. I hope this guy has lots of babies. Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net ! Please update your bookmarks and links to www.waiterrant.net To the Rescue! I've received a couple of aggrieved emails lamenting that I haven't written many posts this week. I'm grateful to have readers that eagerly await each post. The readers, as you can see by the comments, are one of the major reasons why Waiter Rant's traffic has steadily risen over the past months. Thank you! Normally I post two to three times per week. This past week has been especially crazy for me. My brother got married over the weekend. Now, "Fluvio," my boss, is going on vacation and I'm going to be living at the Bistro for the next twelve days. That's right – I'm gonna have to drag my laptop to work! Right now, this instant, I'm sitting to write a post when Fluvio calls. "Hello?" "Get over here. Gwen is throwing up all over the place." Oh, that's appetizing. I groan and look at the clock. It's too early to be hearing this shit. "So what do you want me to do?" I ask. "The restaurant is full and I have no one to work," Fluvio says. I can hear the near panic rising in his voice. "Can Gwen hold on till I get there?" I ask. "I don't think so." I sigh deeply. I wanted to post today. But I've got a job to do. I've got to go now. "I'm on my way boss," I say. Off to the rescue. Again. "Thanks!" Fluvio says hanging up. Folks - I've got to go! I'm a waiter after all! Have a nice weekend. New stories next week! Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net .

Lawyer Blog "It is the trade of lawyers to question everything, yield nothing, and to talk by the hour." - Thomas Jefferson Over the past couple of weeks I've been reading Opinionistas , a blog written by a young female lawyer in NYC. In addition to her describing life as an indentured billable hour servant, replete with grueling hours and impossible workloads, she also describes colleagues sloughing off their youthful idealism as they struggle inside the pressure cooker environment of a major law firm. I particularly liked this entry - Casting That Stone . It’s about how some women seem to abandon their hard earned professional lives in pursuit of safe, boring, marriageable men. Opinionista wonders if women have evolved, if at all, during the past sixty years of feminist awareness. But what I really like about this blog is that you get the sense the author is in the midst of a psychological struggle of her own. In her world of high priced graduate schools, expensed lunches, and status hungry sycophants; everyone is constantly comparing themselves to everybody else. Do I make enough money? Am I more successful? Why is she married and not me? Who's got a corner office? Why did that associate get the deal? It can be a toxic soul eroding landscape that not everyone survives with decency intact. Its obvious Opinionista has second thoughts about being a lawyer. Her ambivalence permeates the entire blog and you wonder what she'll end up doing. Will she chuck her expensive law school degree? Or will she make whatever accommodations she needs to make within herself to remain a lawyer? It's a process all professionals struggle with when they realize the career they've dreamed about since high school isn't all it's cracked up to be. Well written and humorous - I recommend you check Opinionista out. The author
does "question everything" but yields insights into a slice of life we might otherwise have never known about. Go read! My Name is Clark Kent Now that I'm thirty-seven I need glasses in order to read. Not prescription eyewear, just a good set of readers you can pick up at any pharmacy. Years of reading books, peering into computer monitors, and working in low lighting have taken their toll. At least the glasses lend me a professorial air. I'm constantly taking the glasses on and off. I'm always reading something – a dupe pad, the POS monitor, or an order form. Sometimes I'm wearing them tableside. Sometimes I'm not. This occasionally leads to confusion…. A four top sits in my section. I'm wearing my glasses. I go to the table, special, cocktail them, and take their order. When I deliver the apps I've taken the glasses off. "Excuse me," a rather distinguished looking man says, "Could you ask our waiter to come over here?" Huh? I am the waiter. "I beg your pardon sir?" I ask. "Could you get the waiter with the glasses?" I stifle a laugh. Without my spectacles this guy thinks I'm a completely different person. "Right away sir," I reply. I duck out of sight and put my glasses back on. I return to the table. "How can I help you sir?" "I’d like another Manhattan please," the man asks. I make a little bow and go to make the man's drink. I take my glasses off and deliver the cocktail to him. "Who wanted the Manhattan?" I call out. "It’s for me," the man signals. As I place the drink in front of him he peers at me intently. "Hey, you’re the same guy!" the man yelps. "Actually my evil twin works here too. I guess you've met him," I reply winking. The table busts out laughing. "Arthur it's always been the same guy. You’re the one who needs glasses," his wife teases. Chagrined the man take a sip of his drink. "Your other brother is the handsome one," he says. Touche my brother. Touché. I put my glasses back on. The table's cracking up. "So I look better with the glasses on?" I ask. "Actually nothing can improve your mug," the man ripostes. I like this guy. He's customer you can screw with. An optometrist eats in our bistro almost every day. He's left us a pile of business cards. I leave the table and go and fetch one. Returning I hand the card to Arthur the Blind. "Call this guy. He can help you pick out a nice pair," I say triumphantly. "Ok, ok," the man says waving his hands in surrender. "If I may say sir, you desperately need them," I continue. The table is in stitches. "I like your other brother better," Arthur laughs. "Make sure you leave him a nice tip," I counter. Arthur's wife turns to me and says, "You are the first waiter to ever give it back to him. Good for you." Lady, I'm letting him off easy. "For everything there is a first time," I say. The table finishes dinner. I hand the check to Arthur sans spectacles. "Here you go sir. Please don't be mad at my brother. He's a bad, bad waiter." The man chuckles and takes the checkbook. When I return the book is stuffed with cash. "That's all for you," Arthur says smiling. "Thank you sir," I move out of sight and count out the bills. On a $200 check I get fifty bucks. Righteous. The table gets up to leave. I thank the man for his generosity. "You're a good sport sir," I say. You really threw me with the glasses." "Well sir," I say opening the door for him, "now I know how Clark Kent got away with it for so long." The man roars with laughter and walks out into the humid night. As I watch him go I realize Clark Kent and I have a lot in common. Like the reporter from the Daily Planet I too have a secret identity to protect. Mild mannered waiter by day – Superblogger by night! Hey, I've always wanted to be a superhero. I think I'll indulge myself in that delusion for a while. Just call me Clark Kent. Now where's a phone booth?
