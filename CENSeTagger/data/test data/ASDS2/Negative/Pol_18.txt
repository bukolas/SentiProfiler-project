Heffer: If need be, part of it would come from more taxes. No one should shy away from the fact that part of a new economic strategy would comprise more taxes, particularly taxes from those in society who can afford to pay, rather than from those who cannot afford to pay, which is what is happening now.
No, I shall not give way. The hon. Gentleman knows that this is a short debate.
How much money?
Some Conservative Members do not always treat these matters with the seriousness they deserve. We are talking about millions of working people out of work, and we are talking about trying to get the economy right. Conservative Members get serious only when they find that their own companies and interests are involved. Then some of them scream their heads off. We are not concerned with individual companies. We are concerned with the people and with the country's economy. We are concerned about what the Government are doing to them, which is utterly disastrous.
Mr. Charles Morrison <memberconstituency>(Devizes)</memberconstituency><membercontribution>: Many of us had great sympathy with the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) when he referred to the levels of unemployment in his constituency. They are bad enough in my own, but by no stretch of the imagination, thank heavens, do they compare with those in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. However, he does not help his case when he produces woolly solutions and refuses to answer entirely reasonable questions.
It would have been a hard-hearted, insensitive or prejudiced person who would not have had a great deal of sympathy with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as he set
about preparing his Budget. Granted, and much to the Government's credit, inflation is running at half the level of last summer, but otherwise the outlook was anything but rosy. I at least did not entertain the highest of hopes with regard to the Budget. More than usual, it seemed to me that it would have to be based on an assessment of risks and judgments of the lesser of two evils. Almost for sure it was likely to hit at consumption, and if that was to make it an unpopular Budget it had to be accepted as one consequence of the world recession and current conditions.
