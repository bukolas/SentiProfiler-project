As days go, it doesn’t seem like a bad day. The sun is casting a golden glow on the branches of the cedar and spruce trees in the front yard. Other than a couple of drifts created by shovel and blower, the snow has retreated to a few spots that will be shaded by trees for another few weeks. The temperature is balmy enough to make T-shirts a viable alternative to coats. Like I said, as days go, it doesn’t seem bad.
