Numbers are Still Jumping All Over the Place The title says it all. I am not getting consistent numbers on my blood glucose tests at all. Many nights it comes back in range, only to have the next morning be high. Often I can't think of a thing I've eaten that would make the numbers go too high, but they do anyway. The most glaring example lately was while we were traveling, and I had a grilled pork chop and 2 scrambled eggs. That's all. No toast or grits or any carb at all, and had one of the highest readings I've had so far. So, I've made an appointment with my Diabetes doctor for next week. I wasn't scheduled to see him until November, and I just couldn't wait that long. I did have my last Physical Therapy session yesterday. I've got a pretty good exercise routine now, if I can just make myself do it. I've been so down about the testing numbers that I've not been exercising as much as I should. I'll have to do better, for sure. I had a strange morning this morning ... up to my old ways ... been up since 3:30AM. Don't know what happened, but I woke up wide awake and couldn't get back to sleep. That's all I have for today ... just discouraged right now.
