We're leaving for the log cabin in the next hour or so. (I've been calling Greg at work every 30 minutes to tell him to please hurry up. Scout is getting upset and Marvin is ready to leave without him. Ha!) Tomorrow, I am meeting a blogger friend from The Retirement Chronicles for lunch in Mackinaw City. This will make the fifth blogger friend I've met in person so far. Watch out - you could be next! This past weekend we went to the Detroit Kennel Dog Club Show and Scout's brother won 2nd place in the Bernese Mountain dog puppy division! His name is Jet. (And at our last play date, he kept making out with Scout and I had to tell him to take it easy!) Here's a photo of Jet. Isn't he a handsome boy? It was fun to see so many Bernese Mountain Dogs in one place. I wanted to take this boy home with me but his owner said no. I fell in love with this Anatolian Shepherd and decided I want one of these too! Greg dragged me away from the breeder, begging them not to answer my questions and to just ignore me. (I got their business card - ha!) And finally, doesn't this sign crack you up? Scout: I'm having a great day today! It's sunny and I've been playing in the backyard! As long as I have my mommy, dirt to dig and toys to bury, I'm very happy! Marvin: All I need is a patch of sunlight and for that dog to stay outside - and then it's a great day! My Loons should be back within the next 30 days. I'm so excited! I have to get ready. Get the kayak geared up. Another memory card for my camera. And a bull horn so I can yell at all those boaters and jet skiers who get too close to my Loon babies! Here's a video so you can hear how beautiful the Loons sound. Okay, some of you already know how I'm always waving from the deck of my log cabin to my non-acknowledging neighbors across the lake. About half the time it's in the morning when I'm wearing my crazy pajama pants and now combined with my big fluffy ski coat. Looks great, I promise! (HA!) Anyways, the ice fishermen fascinate me. I'm always checking them out with the binoculars to see if they've caught any fish. Imagine my surprise when I was looking at them and saw one of them looking back at me with their binoculars! I waved. And you know what.....he waved too! I'm making progress people..... Do you think I need to throw this bird feeder away? Some updates: School is going well! I was recently inducted into Phi Theta Kappa which is an honors program for community colleges. Greg is joking now he's married to a sorority girl! Okay - then on spring break, he better take me to Florida! Also, I've been volunteering at a local hospital and just love it. The highlight of my week last week is when this angry man was yelling and swearing at a fellow volunteer next to me because he felt like she gave him inadequate directions. When he left, I asked the woman "Who is that?" She replied "The pastor!" LOL!!!! I miss all of you and will be around to visit. (I miss your humor Suz & Jen, I miss your stories and history Betsy, I miss your decorating Penny, I miss your comments Wendy a.k.a. little sis, I miss your projects Sandi, I miss all your interesting tidbits Mildred - and so much more!) Please let me know if I've missed anything! I think it's already snowed 4 or 5 inches and it's still coming down! About 26 degrees but the weatherman says "it feels like 14" - okay then. School was canceled tonight - woo hoo! Oh wait, I don't have any classes on Tuesday night...figures! How is the weather in your neck of the woods today? Here's some photos of my snow monster Scout enjoying the snow! She is a tomboy just like her mom... This sign is posted in our moose-themed bathroom. My hubby gets a lot of use out of this one...ha, ha! Somewhere out of the log cabin.... ...down a wooded winter road.... ....a man tries to walk his spoiled Bernese Mountain Dog. The "offender" in question, who shall remain anonymous, has decided to test the man and show him who's boss. Little does the man know, the "offender" doesn't do this with mommy!
