After eating our meal and taking photos of every nook and cranny of the restaurant, we proceeded to the art gallery found across the parking lot. Other services, like massage and spa, were also available at Kusina Salud. The sun was beckoning us. It was time to leave Kusina Salud and continue with our food trip through the Viaje del Sol.
