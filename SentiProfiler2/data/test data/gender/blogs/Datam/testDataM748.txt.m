The Weds night hang is in flux. Tomorrow is St Patty's, so we'll be steering clear of bars. Plan tomorrow: 5:45 pm: meet at Polly Judd. 6 pm: Ride We'll ride the middle trail south to miserable climb to Bernard/Highdrive, then drop back down on the top trail to Polly Judd to land at Huck's by 7pm. This is all swoopy single track with some climbing. The single track is easy, but the bluff drop off can be distracting to newbies. If you're not into the ride part, then feel free and clear to meet at Huck's. Remember: this is about hanging out and -talking- about bikes. This whole riding thing is new to the Hang, so all bike-talkers are always welcome. Picture this: A rad dude on a "vintage" Bridgestone MB-2. The MB-2 has been hacked into a single-speed. There's no unsightly chain tensioner. Tight. The rad dude is track standing in the front of a long line of traffic at a busy intersection waiting for a red light to turn. He's listening to 20 year-old rad punk music in his mp3 player. It's a sunny day and life is good. And rad. He's aloof but ready to hammer off the line. The light turns green and he lays into his pedals with all of the fury of his middle-aged strength. Bad Religion drowns out the POP! his chain makes as it snaps. His elegant chain line was the result of hours of filing, grinding, and chain-length fussing -- indeed, he had to add and remove his half-chain-link a number of times as he tried different combinations of freewheel and chainring. In the split second he slams his members into the top tube of his vintage steel, he ponders the hackneyed phrase, "you're only as strong as your weakest link." The phrase, as it turns out, does make some sense. Cars move around him, perplexed drivers staring. Another cyclists rides by and says something the rad dude can't hear. Was it, "that didn't look good..."? By now the top-tube has made clear it's immovable, cold, steel resolve upon the rad dude's groin. Tears well up in the rad dude's eyes as he picks up the chain and limps his bike to the side walk, where he will call for a ride home for the second time. With apologies to Lynyrd Skynyrd--if you're not familiar with the song you can check it out here --I offer up this for every cyclist riding in traffic. Gimme Three Feet I was riding along, My head stuck on this song, Right wheel tracking in my lane. When the cars in the mirror Brought on my greatest of fears. They think passin' bikes is a game. They would brush by close As if they wanted to boast Of making three lanes from two. Now I don't like to fight But this just isn't right And I'm lookin' out for you know who. Oh, won't you gimme three feet, Gimme three feet, drivers. Gimme three feet and go around. Gimme three feet. Gimme three feet, drivers, And we make it home safe and sound. I know that I'm slow, But we're sharing the road So please don't make me squirm. Go ahead and zoom After you give me some room And I'll go back to hearing this earworm . Hey, there fellow With the truck painted yellow, I pay my taxes, too. I know that you'd be swayed If you and I would trade And this cyclist now was you. So gimme three feet, Gimme three feet, drivers. Gimme three feet and go around. Gimme three feet. Gimme three feet, drivers, And we make it home safe and sound. I can already hear it playing. Can't you? Score. I see lots of tools on the side of the road when I ride. I've stopped picking up channel lock pliers. As we rode down Broadway this morning I saw this wrench in a flash as we passed. It took me another 10 feet or so to process what I'd seen. All I knew is that whatever the wrench was, it was metric. Hells yeah. A 8 mm/10 mm combo wrench. How perfect is that? I never find such obvious bikey tools like this. I was thinking it was about the best road find one could hope for. But the obvious holy grail of all bike finds would be the Hozan Rock Ring Wrench. I hacked this out of Nate's private fancy invite-only blog. From our ride on Friday.... This is a great ride. I think the last time I rode this was with Jason . Sorry about the formatting. -------------- East Temple Road. Today's half-century-plus took John, Friday Ride newcomer Andrew, Tom and I to a place where winter actually visited, and still lingers. I had a heavy sack of rain and warmth gear on my back, but the promised rain never came, except in spits. It was much warmer than yesterday. We did however meet with lots of wind and plenty of mud. We started at the Scoop for coffee. John was eager to get going. We made our descent on Bernard, and headed out Centenial Trail. We climbed deadly Lehman Hill and made our way to Temple. The climb up Temple is double-deadly, but the views are great... ...in all directions. The guys waited for me to catch up on the hills. At the top of the hill, the eastside gravel road turns to dirt. There was snow, mud, lots of water flowing. The temp dropped in shaded, protected parts of the road, though there was little ice. I walked some of the slipperiest sections, but still managed to fall off the bike once in some snow. (The others rode the whole of it.) But the descent was a blast, and the woods a beautiful place to be. We stopped for some gas station food by Newman Lake, and I took a look at my shoes under the table. Heh! The ride home back on CT was up tempo, into the wind. That section of the CT is pretty on the river side, but bleak on the other. I was getting tired. Tom and I high-fived when my odometer hit 50, then again when his turned 50 a mile later. By the time I got home I was at 57.1, my longest single ride of the year so far. Click for big. Before I begin any postings about where or what I ride, I'd like to introduce myself. Some of you may know me. In fact, "I" seem to be everywhere. You see, I may very well be you. Or you may be me. I'm (we're) the person that loves to bike. Yet, it's often too cold, wet or far. We're in a hurry or there's a meeting we need to look nice for. Or -insert reason not to ride here-. When we do get on the bike we realize how much we like it. How much freedom it provides and how good it makes us feel. But the neighbors dog scares me. I'll ride tomorrow. So here's the deal. Beginning tomorrow, Saturday March 13th I will ride every day for 42 days. It may be a long ride, more likely it'll be a short one. No excuses. Gotta work a 24-hour shift at the Fire Department? Too bad! Ride to work in the morning and home the next day. Heck, that's two days right there. Each day will be blogged about on my personal site (which is even more stale than my bike riding). Send me a personal e-mail at ffemtjacque at gmail dot com if you need the address. The really cool rides I'll post here with pictures. In an effort to keep this post short that's all I really have to say. I'm me and very well may be you. Let's stop making excuses and ride. Till later, Who Loves Ya? Oh, this is why 42 days. --Edit-- Does anyone have a mileage computer I can borrow for this? I'd like to track my daily mileage. I'll return it after the 42-days. --Edit #2-- Thanks for all the responses and support. I've got a computer to track miles and look forward to some rides with ya'll. This just in. Shimano has gone back to their original 2-strap sandal style for the 2010 version. Hallelujah. I've carried on endlessly about the demise of the 2-strap Shimano sandals on this blog. And then there's the Keen Commuter woes . Everytime I talk sandals, I fear the wrath of BSNYC, or his/her followers, but I am proud to speak for the wool-sock-with-sandal-wearing nerds of Fredom. Thank you Shimano for making your sandal look and act more like a sandal again. Now if we can just get Ibex to bring back the Hybrid ...
