Then there was my life, which had fallen apart. All I was left with was the thought that I has tried, really tried and nothing in my life worked and my psychic pain was worse. God, I thought was either ignoring me or he just did not think I had prayed the right prayers, thought the right thoughts, gone to church enough, repented enough, suffered enough, believed enough, done enough, or was just not good enough. And I was very, very angry at Him.

After awhile I gave up and recently decided that I would try to fix me, to save me myself. Then I gave up on God again. And it has been wonderful. My therapist is helping me find hope in, to accept, to connect with, to believe in, myself. I have reached points where I just want to crawl out of my hole and join a wonderful world. When I have those moments where I can't take 'it,' where my childhood demons overwhelm me and I want to get away, I retreat into my room, but I don't want to crawl in a hole anymore. I am open to the ideal that there is indeed something 'else.' Something nurturing, kind, loving, in this universe but I am looking for that within myself.
