Staying in a relationship when it is time to call it quits can lead to serious consequences for your health or well-being. Stress, tension and anxiety can take their toll and it simply isn't worth it. If you are suffering in a bad relationship and there's no sign of improvement, then it is best to end it and move on. It is better to be alone and happy then to stay with someone who makes you unhappy. You owe it to yourself to find true happiness with someone who loves, cares for, and respects you.
