I can't take pictures when the Chapter is open but I snuck a photo in before we got started. Jean is giving some preliminary instruction prior to opening the Chapter.Jean and the Worthy Matron in a pre-meeting conference. Notice the large book on Jean's lap. That is just some of the material they have to go over. I was a little surprised to hear some of Jean's opening remarks and her closing....She got them right here from the "Found For Friday" jokes. I am glad that they were of use. Here are the rest of the photo's Enjoy! Hugs, j
