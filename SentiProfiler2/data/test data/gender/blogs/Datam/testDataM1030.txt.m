Last Friday, the drama department at my school went on a field trip to the University of Arizona in Tucson to tour their theatre department and watch their production of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." The drama teacher asked the faculty if anyone could chaperon. I said I'd do it if my daughter could come along, which she was fine with. So Sofia took a day off of school and we went to Tucson for a little Shakespeare. Since Sofia enjoys drama, I thought it would be a great experience. We had a good time.
