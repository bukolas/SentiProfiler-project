The pending arrival of the 4G wireless technologies, particularly LTE-A but in general even the ‘4G-Lite’ versions of LTE and WiMax, foreshadows a fundamental change for the mobile phone industry.  I’m not just talking about the move to flatter, IP-based architectures, or mobile connections approaching (or exceeding) 100Mbps, or the popularity of 3DTV.  I’m talking about the demise of the mobile plan based on voice minutes.  It is already becoming standard practice for the Operators to mandate data plans with the purchase of the latest smartphones. 

In the next two years we are looking at a 50% growth in phones with Advanced OS (Android, iPhone, Blackberry OS, Symbian S60) which will continue to drive the push for mandatory data plans.  These are data plans with values that can easily exceed the value of the voice plan for the same device.  And they should – for a growing segment of the population, voice usage is dropping dramatically while data usage is skyrocketing (tell me something I don’t know, right?).  So at what point do the voice minute plans become irrelevant for these data-oriented devices and voice-only plans become the entry-level point for the operators for base devices?

Operators could continue to offer ‘voice minutes’ as part of their plan but to what effect?  When voice truly moves to IP, whether it is VoIP via Skype or some other program, just how does the operator actually MEASURE and thus value voice traffic?  A circuit that can be measured in time is no longer set up, packets are sent only when there is something to be transmitted, so ‘time’ as a measure of a voice call becomes irrelevant. So how do you measure the value of the mobile connection?  You COULD still use minutes to measure plan value, but with certain demographics using less and less ‘voice’ and more and more ‘data’ it would seem this is so, well, sooo 2010 and not 2012.  Or soo 2G and not 4G.  I’ll be watching to see how these plans develop.
