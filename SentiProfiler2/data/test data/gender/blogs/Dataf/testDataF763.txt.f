LaLicious Sugar Soufflé body scrub has a devoted following and I now understand why.I received a sample of this body scrub in Tahitian Flower and after one shower with this tub of sugary goodness, I was hooked. The lush scent is deliciously intoxicating and it ended up inspiring compliments and extended sniffing from both loved ones and strangers alike.Furthermore, this scrub packs one heck of a punch when it comes to pampering dry skin. In fact, LaLicious promises that this body scrub is so rich that it will eliminate the need for applying your post-shower lotion. This claim is true — if you follow the directions.
