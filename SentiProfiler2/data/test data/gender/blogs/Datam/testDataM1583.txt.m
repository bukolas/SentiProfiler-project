So, one weekend we were sitting on top of the jungle gym when Roger reached into his backpack and unveiled his most recent acquisition, the price tagger gun from his parents’ store. “This is the coolest thing in the world. I can stick a price on anything now,” he said, fiddling with the dial for a bit, then promptly tagging the jungle gym at 88 cents per can. “See? Now if anyone wants to buy this jungle gym, they have to pay us 88 cents!”
