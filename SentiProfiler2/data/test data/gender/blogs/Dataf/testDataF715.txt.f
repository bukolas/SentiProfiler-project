It was another late arrival home today, so I ended up taking my walk after dinner rather than prior to it, grabbing the camera with the 18-55mm lens on my way out the door. I wanted to get a couple of photos of the downed trees from the storm we had over the weekend. It was NOTHING like the bad weather that my friends in CT experienced. We didnâ€™t lose power here. Below is the old cherry tree that split the lilac in half last year. Can you tell my heart is still broken over that lilac bush?
