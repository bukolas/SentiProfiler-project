I LOVE to read and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE books. So much so that my entire career has been about selling books!

I started off selling Bibles at the Bible Society Bookshop that used to be on Bathurst St in the city. Let's just say that working in the city wasn't dull, even in a bible shop!, then went from there to managing a particular chains bookstores(I decline to name the chain on this blog), an interesting experience in itself, and what lead to my burn-out at only age 25 in the retail industry! Never again, unless I OWN the shop.

Which leads me to my current position as Special Sales Manager for a book importer and distributor. Special Sales basically covers any stores that want to sell books to compliment their existing range of goods. I sell to everyone, from military enthusiasts, to auto nuts, crafters, woodworkers, hobbyists, miniature dolls house makers, sex shops, dvd shops, dog schools, antique stores, equestrian shops...you name em, we sell to em. It's a pretty interesting job and pretty full-on at the moment since the former Special Sales Manager left to have her baby and decided not to come back. Still waiting for someone to replace me...until then I do it all!
