Our country celebrated it's 62nd independence day today.The main essence of celebrating the independence day is to remember our heroes who fought for our country to gain independence from the hands of British.But is it the real case happening in our country.It's really a question to ponder. when we start from school life,the students are asked to come to the school and some chief guest will come and hoist the flag and students will clap.Then the chief guest will be rendering some useless speech and students should clap for it and they will be given a chocolate and return home so that they can spend the other part of the day happily watching TV shows and movies telecasting in it.
When you take the TV channels instead of putting shows on how India got freedom or at least a film taken on patriotism they will be telecasting a film of masala genre.So the children don't know anything about the national heroes.So the Gen Next would also be knowing anything of the national heroes and slowly the main essence of independence day is being forgotten.And it will be considered most of holiday than a day of remembering our heroes.
The worst of all this someone given to pinup the flag in his shirt and he is doing it outside.Even the political leaders exchange wishes only and instead of remembering their heroes they will be thinking of how to impress the people with the help of this day by giving some useless speeches. Worst of all this is Vodafone which charges for sms on special occasions stopped charging on this day and that tells the significance of the day.
