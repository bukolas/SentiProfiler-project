I love Sushi!  The only problem I run into is that my husband is not a fan so I am typically eating sushi as carry out and delivery.  The rolls arrive as fresh as they are if you are lucky enough to have them at the restaurant.  Coast is a great dinning experience either at home or there.  When I do actually get to the restaurant I love to go with girlfriends and share rolls and a bottle of wine.  It is byob but no corkage fee so it actually makes going out for a sushi dinner affordable.
