Maybe I've simply become less patient with idiots and stupid turds.  In a mundane situation, like picking up food I've ordered from a cafe or restaurant, I will get annoyed with the cashier's stupid *** joking and "friendliness" to the point where I get angry.  Shut the f*uck up asswipe and just give me my food  ... quit wasting my time.  Oh you may think you're cute but you're not.  I genuinely feel anger in that moment over some dickhead kid for wasting my time.  If my mental powers were such that my intention or wish came true, the asswipe would spontaneously combust and be dust in the wind.  Seriously, I can get riled up enough that I complain to the person's manager.  I'd like it if all such nuisances were fired from their jobs and I didn't encounter them in the daily routine of things.
