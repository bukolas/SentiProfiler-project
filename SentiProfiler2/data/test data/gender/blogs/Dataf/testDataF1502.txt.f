I dont know why its taken me so long to realize most people don’t live with principles in their lives? I guess since I was raised to carry myself with some integrity...I figured others did the same. No good deed goes unpunished. This I learned the hard way. Humans do not realize they are the very cause of their own demise. In this myriad of complexities we call the matrix or cyber world. People become lost. Hiding behind their pc or phone screen. Playing dress-up for their webcam or camphone. No real friends or relationships. Nothing tangible. Me? I like to be able to reach out n touch someone. Whether it be to show love or put tips on em. Old skool stilo. Just know in my life..Integrity exists. Dignity is honored. Principles matter. When I leave Gods green Earth I can take those with me. The matrix is all an illusion so doesn’t be mislead.
