It's 2010, a whole new year full of possibilities has begun. For so many people, it's seen as a clean slate to mark a starting point. For others, a desperate hope for a terminus of a crap-filled past. For the rest, it's just a date on the calendar that reminds them to do something trivial yet important, like changing the batteries in their smoke detectors.

For me, I suppose it's all three.

First, I find the old soldiers, scattered around but within reach. In the glove box, in the travel case, in the overnight bag, in the dresser. It was time to say goodbye to my old pals, sad they couldn't see any action on the front lines, rotated out, having served their vigilant duty. It was time to bring in the new recruits. Then off to the local recruitment office (AKA Abu's Gas-n-Sip) to find the replacements.

I stood there surveying the troops at Abu's. Twisted Pleasure, Her Pleasure, Shared Pleasure, Intense Ribbed... they've all had their time on the front lines. Magnum XL? I knew there was a Magnum, but an XL??? Damn, I feel sorry for that guy. I finally settle on the 3-pack "Ultra Thin" variety. Good, I could never feel anything with these before, maybe this version will make me feel like I'm actually a part of the process for once. Only a 3-pack because I've thrown more away for being too old and unreliable than I've made use of in my life. Plus, I was a bit jaded after tossing out 2 unopened family packs the day before.

Which really brings up the question: Big boxes of twelve are called "Family Packs". Isn't that a bit counter-intuitive, considering their intended function? Maybe that's what my subconscious was thinking at the time I bought the last few boxes. If I get a Family Pack, I can make a family. Huh.

So anyway, I got the ultra-thin... Not because it was Ultra-Thin (although that might be a bonus) but because it was the box with the furthest-off expiration date: 06-2014. Maybe if the stars align just right, this box will be opened before then.

Oh, I bought a Mega-Millions lottery ticket too while I was at the Gas-n-Sip. I figured I'd have better chances with that than with my other purchase.

Come on, 32!!! Win for me, Sweetheart!
