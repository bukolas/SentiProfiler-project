I can't sleep. I really should be in bed but after tossing and turning while trying to fall asleep, I decided to hang out here and blog instead. Maybe if I empty my thoughts I can actually relax enough to go to bed. I feel like I have had a week long rectal exam. Seriously, my anus hurts just thinking about it. The bank has been poking around our asses for a couple of months now. At first it wasn't so bad. We were approved for a nice size loan and we decided to stay under $20K of the pre-approved amount. So it's not like we were breaking the bank. Then we decided on a new home and the new loan was $35K under the pre-approved loan amount. We patted ourselves on the back for being so frugal. A poke here...a poke there. We can handle that. Our bank seemed to be taking their sweet time but they assured us all along that we were on schedule. About two weeks away from our closing date and all hell breaks loose. It's like they put on their rubber gloves, broke out the petroleum jelly and got their " all up in yo bidness " faces on. I actually had to send them a signed letter yesterday explaining to them that my "alias" on my credit report was my maiden name. I mean, seriously?? I could drone on and on about each and every thing the bank has asked for, and how many times they have lost stuff we have provided. They even forgot to cancel the first loan and even though they sent us a letter stating they had cancelled it the first week in February, they didn't even realize they forgot to until our file went to underwriting and those folks caught that we had two loans on two houses at the same time. Of course, they wear some big britches over there at the bank, so all we can do is sit with our palms out, and play nice until they give us our money. As much as I want to hurl every four letter word I know at them, I grit my teeth and allow them to continue shoving their heads up my butt only because I don't have $200K sitting in my bank account right now. When we bought our first home, we had none of this nonsense. Of course we built that home 8 years ago when the economy wasn't in the shitter. We got our mortgage through the builder since they were offering up a sweet package deal. We have made all of our payments on time. We have stellar credit, and the income to loan ratio is well within our means. We have played this as smart as we can and yet, we are still up late at night biting our nails and wondering if the bank will give us our loan so we can finally have a home again. I don't know what would have happened if we had a couple late payments, or if we had something happen to drop our credit just a tad. I am scared to even think about that outcome at this point. It seems that we, the little people, have to pay for all the mistakes these big banks have made over the last decade. Not only are we digging into our pockets and throwing these guys a bone or two so they don't go bankrupt, but now we are taking it up the rear so they can protect what's left of their assets. We just can't win. You'd think banks would welcome people like us with open arms but instead I feel like this: "You want a piece of me?" No thanks, Mrs. Cheapskate. Keep moving. So here is my situation. We could have closed on our home this past Friday, but because of the two loan errors they have pushed it to this Friday with a possibility of closing sooner if they wrap it up sooner. So we close on Friday. We scramble to order appliances, paint what we can and clean the place up all weekend. We set our move in date to retrieve our items out of storage on Monday. Oh...did I mention my husband goes out of town on Monday? Yeppers. He's out of town pretty much for two weeks as we put our house back together again. Not to mention the move out of our apartment. Gee, I wonder why I am losing sleep right now... On a happy note, I ordered my curtains for the dining room. Yes. I totally effed myself there, didn't I? Taking the plunge and ordering curtains for a home I don't own yet. I know....shame on me. But I pushed my superstitions aside and junped on these curtains because they were on sale. I even ordered them online (eek!) so I have no idea if they will be the look and feel of what I really want, but I am winging it since I saved like $100.00! I dropped $47.00 for the pair so I feel really good about that. They are a grey damask pattern. I am in love with damask right now. Common sense tells me that I need to be more wiser in my color choices, being that I have three monsters and two dogs that will be running in and out of that patio door dragging in who knows what from outside and wiping their ketchup fingers on my dry clean only elegant damask curtains...but the little princess inside me screams for some sort of femininity in a sea of males. These curtains are my lipstick, dammit! I just have to pray, they don't end up covered in actual lipstick, being that my toddler has a newfound infatuation with my makeup purse lately... Welllll folks. I am actually getting sleepy again. Looks like hammering out this post helped after all! It's the beginning of a great day! At least that is what I'll tell myself as I bend over and grab my ankles... Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Good Morning, Everyone! I've been busy getting ready to move from our apartment to our home, but I took a break and was checking out some of blogs off my sidebar and on The Whitt's family blog: The Whitt's there was a post that struck me and I felt I had to share with you in hopes you can help Spencer raise money towards a cure for childhood cancer in honor of his sister Tuesday. Some of you may remember little Tuesday Whitt's battle with neuroblastoma. Her story is one I will personally never forget. Tuesday was a little girl I never met in person, but through her family blog, her courage and grace touched me. Her mother, Jessica has continued to blog and over a year after Tuesday went to be with our Lord, I think of Tuesday and her family every single day. Seeing Spencer on the site in a photo holding Tuesday, and the words that he was going to shave his head in his little sister's memory....I am moved beyond words. I wish I had all the money in the whole world to donate to St. Baldrick's. If you would like to donate, you can visit Spencer's page on the St. Baldrick's site. In the meantime, every cent counts. So please, even if you can't make a monetary donation, please visit The Whitt's and read the post, then share the word any way you can, blog it...tweet it....facebook it..whatever you can. Awareness is so important! God Bless! --NOTE-- If you are like me and you prefer to donate via Paypal, there is no paypal option on the St. Baldrick's site. On The Whitt's Blog is a sidebar with a "donate" button which is a paypal option. You can send a note saying you are donating for Spencer's St. Baldrick's fund. Just thought I would let you know to save you the trouble if you like using paypal!! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom I was introduced to the Old Fashioned on my first trip to Wisconsin to meet my husband's family. I am not a big drinker and I favor beverages like margaritas, mojitos, plum wine, beer with lime, anything fruity. In my life as a mom, I never get to go out so on the rare occasion that I find myself at an actual bar, I end up frozen like a deer in the headlights when asked what I want to drink. This moment arised on my trip to Wisconsin, and my husband ordered me a brandy Old Fashioned Sweet. A few minutes later, he arrived with drink in hand. It was a rosy pink bubbly drink with green olives. Hmmmm....interesting but I felt a bit adventurous that night so I gave it a go. The Old Fashioned was an instant hit with me. It was so good! Sweet, a bit fruity and the olives...if you save those and eat them just before the last sip...they are a perfect end to this drink! You can make the Old Fashioned many ways. Mainly there are two ways to order it, either Sweet or Sour. Sweet usually means using Sprite in the mix. Some people like to pass on the olives and garnish with cherries and an orange slice. You can use whiskey or brandy. Brandy makes it sweetest. Sour usually means using Squirt in the mix. I like the sour version just as much as the sweet. I've had garnishes like green olives, and pickled brussel sprouts (again WEIRRRD but really good once you get over the fact it is a pickled brussel sprout, haha!) Whiskey is normally the choice of liquor for the Old Fashioned Sour. Try ordering the Old Fashioned outside of the midwest and you will likely see the bartender stumped. We tried several times in Denver and usually got something completely different than we wanted. It was never the Wisconsin Old Fashioned. Here is what you need to make an Old Fashioned: Old Fashioned Cocktail Mix: (1 ounce) (It's hard to come by outside the midwest but if you are an online shopper there are a few places that sell this mix. I found a three pack gift for $18.99 plus $6.99 shipping.) Alcohol: (2 oz or to your preference) Choose from Whiskey, Bourbon or Brandy Soda: (1-2 oz) Sprite, Squirt, Club Soda...I like Grapefruit Sierra Mist or the cranberry soda that comes out around the holidays. I prefer using diet soda to save myself some calories. Garnish: orange slice, cherries, green olives, pickled stuff, lime wedge... This drink is served on the rocks, preferably in an old fashioned cocktail tumbler, hence the name! After a long week of chasing kids, nothing is better than a couple Old Fashioneds on a Friday night! I hope you enjoyed this taste of Wisconsin! I love sharing these midwest tidbits with you! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Lots to do as we prepare to move again! So I leave you this weekend with a weiner. No, not my gay dachshunds though I am sure they would slobber all over this hunk of meat! Have a pleasureable weekend! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom (Thanks hubby's co-worker for the tip!) Remember this sign? Looks like word got out about my Nickname...(ok really it's just a funny coincidence!) Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom This morning I woke up, knowing that today was going to be a little tough and ready to get the day over with. It's a gloomy day, with a steady light rain cleansing the surface. I was happy to see green grass poking through the dead stuff. While driving my son to school, the radio announced that Corey Haim had died of a prescription drug overdose. "Take it back!" I yelled at the radio. My 6 year old looked at me like I was nuts. Before they were finished announcing this sad story, my phone rang. It was my husband calling to tell me the news. Corey Haim was my childhood crush. To say I was in love with him is an understatement. It was more like obsessed. I had planned our wedding numerous times. I knew we were soul mates. I had posters covering every inch of my walls and ceiling when I was a teen. I would trade Tiger Beat and Bop photos with my friends. They all wanted NKOTB pictures so I would collect as many as I could to trade for Corey Haim posters. I didn't have a lot of consistency in my life, and Corey Haim stayed with me, in many bedrooms for many years. His posters were worn and ragged with missing edges from the countless times I moved him from one home to another. To think that he died on the same date that my Father died...Damn. It is just a coincidence, but it just makes March 10th even sadder for me. I fell in love with Corey while watching Lucas. In the movie, he was so sweet and shy. He was also determined, and that quality reminded me of myself. He had a broken home, he was picked on at school, and he just kind of shuffled through life without being noticed much. In the end, he won the affections of his school and his town as well as the adoration of a 10 year old girl. When Lost Boys came out, I felt like I had struck gold! My older foster siblings were drooling over Jason Patrick, but I was all about Sam. Corey had grown up from little boy to totally rad teen. I was in love. The scene with him singing in the bath tub. That was my favorite. I'd watch it over and over and sigh with stars in my eyes. He was so dreamy... I never really understood why everyone referred to Corey Haim and Corey Feldman as "The Two Coreys" they never really seemed like a good pair to me. Just because they made a couple of movies together, and they shared the same first name. I think that paved the path for failure for both of them because it was almost like they were expected to make movies together even though they really were very different in ways that made for bad movies. Don't get me wrong, I loved License to Drive and the Lost Boys. But when they got around to Dream a Little Dream that is when they really should have aggressively explored their independence. I think they were waiting for the next big script that would pair them up and it never came. By the time they came out of their drug induced stupor long enough to realize it, they were already considered to be another washed up pair of Hollywood kid actor casualties. Corey never left my heart. The good thing about movies is they can be played over and over and I would get lost in Coreyland daily, whether it was through pictures or movies, he was my future husband and that bond (though one sided) was solid as a rock. Somehow through the years, as things changed in my life, I outgrew the Corey posters, but always had a place in my heart for him. I watched him go from smiley kid to troubled teen. From troubled teen to the man on the A&amp;E reality show "The Two Coreys" I was so sad for the loss of the Corey I fell in love with. That Corey was dead. Long ago buried by a mix of drugs, alcohol and prescription meds. My heart broke for the young kid with so much potential. I was disgusted with the shell of a man Corey turned out to be. I didn't understand why he felt his life was so hard, he couldn't face it without some sort of high. Then came the fight between him and Corey where he broke down and said that Corey Feldman knew his "friend" had molested him and he did nothing to help him. My heart ached for him. I know that kind of pain. It can eat you alive. For some reason, victims have a common trait, they blame themselves for what happened to them. The guilt...it consumes you. To be a successful actor, in the prime of his career...to have someone rip your innocence from you in such a disgusting way, and then know that your only friend doesn't have your back...that explained a lot to me. To know that Corey never got counseling for this, that he turned to drugs and alcohol to numb his pain, it is just so very sad. I hope that Corey Feldman finally comes forward and brings justice for Corey Haim. I don't want to know who hurt Corey, but whoever did needs to be punished for his actions. If this man is still out there, who knows how many people he has hurt along the way. 38 years old is too young to die. It is so tragic. Even though he did this to himself, his life was full of people who enabled him. This could have been avoided if someone loved him enough to step in and help him get the care he needed and helped him to understand that what happened to him was not his fault and it was not ok to bury it the way he did through all those drugs and all that anger. Now, Corey Haim can stop running from his demons. I pray that he can finally rest in peace. This is the way I want to remember him... Sadly, in death there are no take backs. Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom It's foggy, cold and dreary today. I'm stuck indoors in my apartment. As my son naps, I am alone with my thoughts. So I'm just going to dump 'em here and wait for the sun to peek out. Tomorrow marks 3 years since I lost my Dad. I knew it was coming. I try and pretend that my heart is healed from losing him, but it is still broken. I feel orphaned. I felt that my whole life, and then for a little while I got a taste of what it was like to have a parent. Some days it was nice. Others, it took work. But when it came right down to it, I truly enjoyed being someone's daughter. When he died, the daughter part of me died with him. I miss being loved like a daughter. I miss the bond we shared. His big bear hugs. His gentle nature. His goofy sense of humor and the way he would smile with his blue eyes. He was a beautiful man, and now he is a beautiful spirit. I pray he can see my heart and feel my love 
or him today, and know that my love for him has not faded with time. I do want to thank everyone that left me encouraging words when I posted the note from my mother . I haven't had a chance to write you each individually, so I want to tell you how much your words meant to me and how they lifted me up and gave me strength when I needed it. I pride myself in being strong, but every now and then I know it's ok to gather the strength of others when you hit a weak patch. I have been tossing around the idea of writing my mother back. One moment I tell myself not to bother, the next I feel I need to give her a piece of my mind. The teeter totter balanced favorably towards me responding, so I did. I feel better now that I have said what I needed to say and I can finally move away from that negativity. Onward and upward. My bank was supposed to respond to us yesterday in regards to closing this Friday. They have yet to respond. I find it frustrating when people think they can just not bother answering you, just because they have no news. I'd rather them just call and update us, even if it is "Hey, we are still working on things but I will let you know once we have an answer" instead of "Hey, I'll have an answer by the end of the day..." then nothing...nada. Not even returning calls or emails. Makes me want to scream. Sitting here in this apartment wondering when I can get my hands on our house is making me want to scream. I think I'll have to go back to digging through catalogs and get lost in design dreamland. That has been my sanity saver! If only I was like a buzillionaire, I could actually buy everything my heart desires!! Money does not buy you happiness, but cool stuff from catalogs makes me happy! Of course I can be happy about one thing today...at least I don't have a mega case of the crazies like Lindsay Lohan! OMG - she has flipped off her rocker. Time's up! This concludes my therapy session. Have a Nice Day. --Update-- Sun came out to say hello! I snapped this picture while driving and then it faded away again. Keep on the sunny side... Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Good Monday to you!! I hope you all had a great weekend! I am super excited because a week from now we should finally be in our home!! In my last post I shared some ideas I have been pondering for my kids playroom. Over the weekend, I got my first Land of Nod catalog and there were a ton of cute ideas in there! One picture captured almost exactly what I envisioned for my boys' playroom: I especially love the chalkboard wall cling panels! They come in a set of 4 panels and chalk for $58.00 Of course I think $58.00 is a bit steep so I did a search to see what I could find for less: I found a great vinyl chalkboard panel for $38.00 from Etsy.com store Wilson Graphics It measures 24.5" Wide by 48" high. The Land of Nod panels when combined measured 38" x 49" so for a little less chalkboard space I still get my money's worth! I picture applying the chalkboard "sideways" as opposed to how the photo displays it. That way I get the look I am going for. I also LOVE the funky alphabet letters in the Land of Nod catalog photo. In the catalog they are asking for $49.00 for a set of 51 letters. They are not reusable so when they come off they stay off. I went on an Amazon hunt to find me a bargain! For just $12.99 I found an adorable complete alphabet set that is reuseable and includes upper and lower case letters! I'm thrilled with this price! I'm an Amazon freak so I know I will find something else to buy so I can get my free super saver shipping! Maybe I'll buy these cute number wall decals to go with the alphabet! Last night I was at Target with my husband and I was on the prowl to find a good deal for my playroom. I came across this cute organizer on sale! It's normally $59.00 but at Target this week it is only $37.00! That's $22.00 off! So I snagged the second to last one! The book rack in the Land of Nod catalog is $199.00 but you can grab a Kidcraft Sling Book Holder from CSN Stores for just $29.95! I love the table and chairs set in the photo, but I am not at all willing to spend $140.00 on two chairs and $249.00 for the table as shown in the catalog. The biggest feature I love is the storage under the table and I found this adorable KidKraft table and chair set for only $89.99! Just think about it...for a little more than the cost of one Land of Nod Chair you can get an entire set! Or if you like the look of the warm wood with the colorful chairs you can opt for the KidKraft Euro Honey Table with Four Chairs for only $159.95! I looked at places like Amazon and Wal-Mart and they were $50.00 higher than Allkidsfurniture.com! Notice the cute polka dot mat under the table in the photo? Land of Nod sells these "Splat Mats" for $39.00! I found one at JazzyJem's Artfire shop for only $28.00 which inludes shipping! So let's do the math: Land of Nod Play Room: $736.00 Cheapskate Knock Off Playroom: $305.90 (which includes the storage organizer and the more expensive table and chair set!) Pretty Impressive, huh?
