It has been a while since my last post. These long breaks are becoming more frequent and I'm not quite sure why. My life is probably no more hectic than some of yours, so for me to make excuses would be completely reckless. Many of you may have known that I have been in the media business for many years, and about 5 years ago I partnered with someone to open our own media sales organization. It was an exciting time for me and I'm glad that I did it. We had made significant progress over the years, but at the same time I felt it wasn't significant enough for me to continue in the partnership. I recently decided to hand the operations over to my partner and the other two companies that we had formed a relationship with. It was time for me to move on. I was hired four weeks ago by our local Fox Network affiliate, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, the largest independent broadcasting company in the country. It has been a crazy few weeks, but things are really starting to fall into place. I am excited for our future and will try and keep all of you posted on our progress. The kids are in school and once again we are pleased with the curriculum. Robin is doing extremely well in her classes to become a PA. I keep on telling myself that she'll only be in school for two more years thinking that it may calm me down a bit. It doesn't work. I'm sure that once we find our rhythm, things will fall into the proper place.
