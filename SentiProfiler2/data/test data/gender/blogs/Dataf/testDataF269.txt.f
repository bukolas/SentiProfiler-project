I want to reiterate that I really like the lunch "ladies" at my school. These are hard-working women and men doing their job every single day. The quality of the lunches is something completely out of their control. I worked in the dishroom of my dorm cafeteria my first year of college. It was hot and smelly work standing in the spray of an industrial dishwasher. Shifts started early and you had to wear uniforms and hairnets. I was usually half-awake. Every day I would go back to my dorm room and smell like grease or fast food or...I couldn't put my finger on what exactly, but if you ever worked in food service, you know that smell. The unwritten rule is that you MUST go home and shower after your shift is over. It's not enough to take off your uniform! I had a lot of fun in that job because the other employees were college students and we got to socialize during our shifts. I made some good friends. I also knew it was not my lifetime vocation. The women and men working in the lunch room have to put up with similar conditions as I did, but they do it year after year. There's a lot of heavy-lifting, smelly food garbage, and messes made by the children. I'd like to point out that the cafeteria and what I've since of kitchen are exceptionally clean. It's a credit to these devoted professionals.
