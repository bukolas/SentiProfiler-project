Junior right-hander Jose Macias (Bronx, N.Y.) threw a no-hitter on Monday afternoon to lead the No. 14/20 nationally ranked Franklin Pierce University baseball team to an 11-0 victory over Saint Michael's in neutral-site, non-conference play at Santaluces Sports Complex. Earlier in the day, junior third baseman Derek Ingui (Sterling, Mass.)clubbed a two-run home run as the Ravens rallied from a 4-2 deficit to defeat Nyack, 5-4. With the wins, Franklin Pierce improves to 9-1 (0-0 Northeast-10) and extends its winning streak to six games. In the second game of the day, Franklin Pierce scored the only two runs it would need in the bottom of the first inning. With two outs, junior left fielder Mike Munoz (Bronx, N.Y.) reached on a single and immediately came around to score on a double by senior right fielder Phil Hendricks (Pittsfield, Maine). Hendricks in turn scored on an RBI single by graduate student first baseman Mike Augustine (Kingston, N.Y.). Later in the game, Franklin Pierce would score three runs in the fifth, two in the sixth and four in the seventh to create the 11-0 final. Munoz knocked a two-run single in the fifth, while Ingui drove home a run with a single in the sixth. In the seventh, freshman center fielder Nick LaCroix (Grafton, Mass.) had an RBI single, freshman shortstop Dan Kemp (Sturbridge, Mass.) clubbed a run-scoring double and senior second baseman Cody Kauffman (Blue Bell, Pa.) hit an RBI single as part of the four-run inning. Meanwhile, Macias was sparkling on the mound for Franklin Pierce. He allowed only three baserunners on a first-inning error and both a hit batsman and a walk in the second. Thanks to a pickoff, he faced 29 batters, only two over the minimum, during the game, issued one walk and struck out 12. He struck out the side in order in the fifth as part of five consecutive strikeouts and later struck out five of the final eight batters of the game. It was the sixth no-hitter in Franklin Pierce history, as well as the fourth thrown by the Ravens against Division II competition. It marks the third no-hitter in four years for the Ravens and the second year in a row with a no-no for the program. Last season, Mike Adams and Kyle Vazquez combined to throw a no-hitter for Franklin Pierce at Dowling on Feb. 21. Before that, Andrew McNulty did the deed against Bloomfield on March 16, 2007. Senior right-hander Mike Robert started on the hill and took the loss (0-1) for Saint Michael's. Over 5.1 innings, he was touched up for six runs on eight hits and issued a pair of walks. In the first game of the day, Franklin Pierce found itself trailing 4-2 heading into the seventh inning. Kauffman led off the inning and started the rally off by working a walk. Ingui followed and drilled a two-run, game-tying home run, his first round-tripper of the season. Sophomore catcher Mike Dowd (East Bridgewater, Mass.) followed, was hit by a pitch and moved around to third while Munoz reached on an error. Dowd would then score the eventual game-winning run on a sacrifice fly by Hendricks. After freshman right-hander Rob Blanc (Sandy Hook, Conn.) worked a scoreless eighth inning to run his relief appearance to 2.2 shutout innings, junior right-hander Rob Nicholas (Southborough, Mass.) pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to chalk up his third save of the season. Senior right-hander Heath Wasylow (Rehoboth, Mass.) started on the hill and did not factor in the decision for Franklin Pierce in the first game. Over 5.1 innings, he allowed four runs on eight hits, did not issue a walk and struck out five. Blanc picked up the win (1-0) in relief, as he allowed three hits and one walk over his 2.2 innings. Sophomore Kevin Earlie went the distance on the mound and took the loss for Nyack. The Ravens return to the field on Tuesday, March 16, when they travel to Nova Southeastern for a non-conference contest. First pitch is scheduled for 6 p.m. at NSU Baseball Complex in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
