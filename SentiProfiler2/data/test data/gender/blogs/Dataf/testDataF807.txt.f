This really is a rectangle sewed together in a tube, but it was good practice with a ribbed pattern.  And the yarn that I have is a bit too chunky for this, but I think it could work over my usual leather gloves for some extra warmth.  Or to wear in the cold office and still be able to type.  At the advice of a friend I'm going to try to learn a new technique with each new project.  So for my second project I learned how to cable knit.  It actually is pretty easy.  And now I can look at my store-bought sweaters and see exactly how they are made.
