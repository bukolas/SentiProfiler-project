Watch this and die from hysterical bouts of laughter. Only for those who know Russian. But anyway - visuals are also good. By the way, long time ago I was a  Viseum Ad Agency started this new campaign for Hummer. “Get Out of My Way!” Exactly! I’m not sure who exactly buys Hummers in Europe or the US (Borat?) but in Moscow (judging by their driving habit) they are all blood-thirsty Trolls from Mordor. It’s hard to say as windows are always heavily tinted. This ad was criticized by Russian advertising community for being actually a call for irresponsible behavior.teacher of English and German at a high school numero uno in Onega Arkhangelsk Region (activate your Google Earth). This is one of the most hilarious cartoons I've ever seen in my life. Every bottle of this "Standart" vodka has a small silver coin. Coins are different so one has a chance to become an owner of a good collection. Recommended retail price is 160 rubles ($6.15). I see a man (left) and a squatted woman with a huge hair do (right) who's giving the man a blow job. Prodvizheniye company from St.Petersburg promotes a vodka brand RUS that should be national and local at the same time. It’s label looks like a car license plate with regional codes. If you live in Chita you buy 75 vodka but if you’re from Saratov then you choose 64. Your local chauvinism should prevent you from buying ‘alien’ vodkas. I’m sure St.Petersburgers (78 code) would angrily refuse even to touch 97 vodka (Moscow). But wait! Moscow has at least three codes: 97, 99, 117. Muscovites are already too rich and now they get at least four different vodkas while the rest of the country must be satisfied with only one. It’s unclear to me why all prizes for the most stupid, ridiculous and unfocused commercials in Russia are always won by ramen noodles producers. Take this piece of commercial by Rollton, for example. If you want to win your man give him Rollton ramen noodles. Right! This is a kind of birthday dinner every homeless dreams about.
