I went to the doctor today. I have gained one pound in two months. But keep in mind that I'm no angel outside of work. For example, we just had Valentine's Day and I ate a lot some chocolates. I also want to let you know that in December I did have blood taken, I did a sugar fast, and the basic stats were run. At that time I was normal. I did have low HDL (the good cholesterol), but my overall cholesterol is fantastic. Why did I do that? Well, I have awesome insurance that gives healthy adults a yearly discount if I get a physical and basic blood work done (thereby proving my health status). I love the policy because it's common sense. Plus it's a great way to discover a problem before it turns into something. Preventative versus reactive. It's way cheaper to give discounts up front than pay for a major problem five years down the road. When those tests were run, I hadn't even fully come up with the idea of the blog so it's really fortuitous. Whenever this project ends, I'll be able to compare pre- and post-data. That being said I haven't been feeling myself recently. I'm having more stomachaches and that's why I visited the doctor. I'm looking into it and I'll keep you updated.
