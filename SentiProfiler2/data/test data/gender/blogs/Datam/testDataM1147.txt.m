Getting Motivated
Posted by Scott on Mar 12, 2010 in Marketing
Today I am presenting you with the opportunity for motivation. Opportunity may knock, but it’s never going to beat down the door with a battering ram, so you better be listening for the knock. I am going to ask you give yourself a motivational test today, and once a week for the next month. This is opportunity knocking and I need you to be motivated enough to open the door and let it in. Now you know in your mind that the opportunity that’s knocking will require you to work, right? Don’t play the “I’m going to play like no one is home” routine because opportunity will not come back to you again. Getting motivated to do something is not an easy task, and for many of us it does not come naturally. Would it be easier for you if I gave you some atta-boy’s right off the bat? You are a valuable photographer. People in your community place a lot of value in your work. When your clients think of their most valuable possession in their home, the art and memories that you created for them are at the top of their list. OK ego’s stroked enough because my wrist is getting tired… Seriously now the word “value” is an important description of you and your work. The more valuable you are to your clients the more money you get to earn. Notice the word “earn” You are earning a living as a photographer.  I am always preaching about identifying your top clients and getting into their networks of family and friends.  Well this time I want you to identify the top clients of yours that really believe in your value to them.  They are going to be your best evangelists.  Many photographers have developed a wishbone where  there spine is supposed to be.  I wish, I wish, I wish… but never an “I really put my back into it and worked hard to accomplish ______”  Too much wishy washy crap going on in our industry.  If you want to stroke something three times and make a wish I’ll give you something to stroke… Probably not the results your hoping for though.  You are never going to win an award for mediocrity so stop trying to.  Look for client trends in your studio.  Where are my best clients from?  Who sent them?  Where can I reach more people like them? I am telling you this stuff works, but it takes some effort at first but trust me it will become effortless in the future.  Every day I hear from photographers that are struggling in this industry but 95% of them are like the fat guy ordering a Big Mac and a Diet coke but wondering why he is not loosing weight.  Working on yourself first and your business second will get you so much further in life.  You are the tool, and the business is what you create with that tool. (not to be confused with “you are a tool” that’s something else)  Being motivated will allow you to focus and accomplish so much more with your business.   Here is the simple test, print this out and keep it on your desk.
If I were motivated to improve my life, I would be more ______________________ (insert answer) Fit, reliable, happy, successful, etc…. Insert as many as you want.  Put the most important ones first.
If I were motivated to improve my life, I would have more ____________________
If I were motivated to improve my life, my business would be more _________________________
If I were motivated to improve my life, what could I offer to others that I’m not offering now ______________________
I will commit myself to being happier and more motivated.
I will take specific actions in my life towards obtaining the items listed above.
I wish no more…. This week I will complete __________________ (Insert a task you have been wanting to do) 
Join me on our 30 days for change.  Fill this out once a week and see if some of your answers change or move positions in the lists.   (your weekly tasks better change)    I know many of you have tons of things that you have been putting off doing, that you know you need to do.  You spend more time thinking about not doing those tasks than it probably actually takes just to do them.  I’m not just preaching to the choir here I too need to get my act in gear on several things that I keep putting off because I’m not motivated to complete them.  I am highly motivates towards certain things, but I have an unmotivated bag that I seem to carry around.  I keep putting crap in it that I don’t want to do until it’s full and I can’t close it anymore.  It’s my man purse!  (metaphorically speaking of course) and it’s filled with a bunch of little things that I am going to do.  I don’t know if this will inspire anyone or if it was just good for me to put this challenge out there.  Redefine your life right now.  What do you want and how do your want it?  Now how are you going to get it?  A race is never won if you never take the first step.  Today is your first step…. Maybe you won’t win but I hope you at least reach the finish line. 
I want you to be a quitter!  Some people say never quit, never give up… Blah blah blah….  Quit procrastinating, quit smoking, quit eating crap, quit thinking negativly, quit all kinds of bad stuff and start replacing it with the good stuff. 
I can’t light a fire under anyone to get them motivated, they have to pull out their wick and light it themselves.  I can pass the lit match to you, but you have to take it from there.  Now go lite your little wick.
