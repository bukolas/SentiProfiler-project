Slept until 11am. Time change seems to have no effect. in fact filled my tires with air and went for a bike ride around the complex like 5 times. Legs were hurting so stopped and came inside. Time change no effect as of yet but being cautious. Feeling pretty up and positive. Need to get gas for car and then run a few errands. Laundry is going to wait again. Goal for next week is to complete all of it. It is at least in a semi organized piles and ready to be washed. Need to find a laundry shop to complete. Also need to register for IML volunteer and start working on getting taxes filed and the $5,000.00 medical bill from last hospitalization. That is approximate including Doctors which I have yet to receive. Funny they are charging me over $3,000 for the CPAP. that is the price of a new machine. I plan on fighting that charge to see what happens. Will be using health advocate to see what, if anything can be done. Last night did not sleep right away so created contracts for my support system alerting them if what they should be on the look out for and what actions to take if they see me doing those actions.
