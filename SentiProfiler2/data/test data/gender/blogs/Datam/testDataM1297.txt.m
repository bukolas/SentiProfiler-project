Jane decided to attend the ward round meeting earlier this week. We had been to the planning meeting only a couple of weeks earlier. But of course, yet again, things change so quickly that there is a need for a short term response and the longer term plan can be quickly forgotten. We wanted to emphasise our thanks to the staff for the fact that they were still being positive with Sam and with us while things have been difficult. Also we wanted to suggest that there needed to be a major input of some sort in terms of psychological and therapeutic support to try to get Sam over this blip. They started though by trying very hard to reassure Jane that they had no intentions of trying to move Sam elsewhere. Jane must have mentioned this. It is a real fear. It has happened everywhere else. They are so used to "improvement" in their behavioural sense with the possibility of patients moving on. When an initial improvement leads ultimately to further decline they are at a loss and eager to move him on before it becomes apparent or because they do not know want to do next. Sam is now on a forensic ward. Where does he go from here if they can't cope? But only a few weeks ago on Christmas Day Sam and the family enjoyed a lovely day together. So it can go well for him and us. How do we get back on the upward spiral? So they were trying hard to reassure Jane of this. Then they started to talk of medication. They see a need for change. They do not understand him. He seems to be outside their experience. Usually on Clozapine patients do so well ... Sam has been there for eighteen months now. This is the second time he has been on Clozapine. Both times he has been taken to hospital with physical health concerns. So what do they propose now? More psychological and therapeutic support? No ...
