So yesterday was my first weekend shift. It was from 12PM-11PM, but I didn't show up until 3PM. Lol, it had completely slipped my mind. I had woken up around 1PM and made breakfast and stuff. As I got out of the shower, I was like, "Holy shit, I was supposed to be at work right now". Needless to say, I got dressed and drove to work.

I was assigned to a new trainer named Lauren. I think she mentioned that she trained Katherine, not entirely too sure on that. Anyhoo, Saturday was a pretty lax day comparatively. I had begun to practice documenting on a notepad and then entering in the computer system. I'm getting the hang of it, but there's still so much to learn about the whole thing. I met a lot of new people on Saturday. I guess it was because that's when most people worked, considering they are around my age but a little older.
