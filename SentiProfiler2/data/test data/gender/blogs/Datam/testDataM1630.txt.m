So, by now, I would imagine that if you are reading this, you've probably heard that I am no longer in the Kendalville-based metal band, Forthcoming. Well the rumors are true. I made the decision about a week ago to part from the guys, and get my life on track. Thereâ€™s still some uncertainty in my head as to how I stand in the eyes of everyone else in the band. Here is how I see the situation:

   I am a devout christian, and everything Forthcoming stands for is based around Christ, and I love that aspect of the band. Second, I couldn't have asked for a greater group of guy to perform with for the year I was in the band. I learned a lot from all of them, and looked to all of them like family. Being the youngest in the band by quite a few years, I got to pretty much experience having 3 older brothers that I didn't get to have growing up. Joe, Jeremy, and Jake, no matter what, I'm always going to love you guys. I want you to know that.
