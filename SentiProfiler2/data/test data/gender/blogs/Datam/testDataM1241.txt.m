Hear ye, hear ye! I doth proclaim myself a full-fledged (or as close as I can be) adult. I’ve schooled. I’ve worked. I’ve lived. I’ve toiled. I am a fully-fledged adult. I’ve taken on responsibility. I’ve buckled down when the times required me to. I’ve been the epitome of Emily Post’s great-great-grandchild. Yes, I am a full-fledged adult. I may now proceed onto bigger and better things. I am an adult who is comfortable in their own Chupa Chups skin. I’m as honest as can be. I feel really guilty lying to people, but I’m not one to shy away from a little white lie; you know, like the few times a homeless person comes up to you and asks you for change and you say you don’t have any. I mean don’t get me wrong. I give up my change if I have it. However, if I’m not in the best financial situations, I’m most certainly not going to give up my laundry money quarter to a stranger who’s probably making good on loose change. If I can’t afford to give coins, I do my best to offer whatever food I may have. (Haven’t you noticed that although they say they want something to eat, they’d rather get the cash instead?) So, yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. I practice good hygiene. In the winter, I shower, floss, brush, and rinse at least twice a day; morning and night. When summer time arrives, it’s at least three times. I commit to nourishing my body with healthy foods. I’ve just taught myself to eat celery. I’m not 100% there but I’m a good 40% there. I’ve taught myself to eat spinach, broccoli, bean curd, tofu, etc. Yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. Sadly, as this fully-fledged adult, my metabolism isn’t the best. It’s increasingly slowing down. It’s harder for me to manage my weight. Although I’ve not gained much weight, I’ve also not been able to lose any; mostly because I forget the most important part of the component of weight loss- actually get up off the couch. Sigh. SO to the world: I doth proclaim my adultness. I am one of you. I’ve joined your ranks. I’m a doer and not just a follower. World, that is all. Please continue with your day. Goodbye.
