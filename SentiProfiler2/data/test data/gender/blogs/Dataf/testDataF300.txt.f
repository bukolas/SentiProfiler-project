My favourite olympians are speed skaters Catriona Lemay Doan and Susan Auch. Actually I love our whole women's speed skating team to pieces! These women inspired me so much at the Nagano olympics that I started speed skating soon after. Susan Auch also has asthma. Oh yes, and all of Canada is pretty enamoured with mogul skier Alexandre Bilodeau at the moment. He and his brother, who has CP, seem to totally feed off each other for inspiration, I love it! I have more, and frankly they're all fantastic but Catriona and Susan are my top! PS Kyra and Amy, a couple of my fave American bloggers have expressed their total bewilderment at the sport of curling. Yes, it's totally a weird sport but in Canada it's one of those weird-but-normal things. I had no idea it was such a thing. How's Miss Sidekick's project coming?
