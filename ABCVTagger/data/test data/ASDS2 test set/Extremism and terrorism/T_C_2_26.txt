RISE(AND FALL) OF GRAVE WORSHIPPER MILITIAS IN SOMALIA(part 3) : - Now reports are coming in of Ethiopian troops reoccupying Beled Wayne,Hiraan's capital.This seems to be part of the plan mentioned by a Purdue University professor(forgot the name,surname is bernstein or weinstein) in an article on Garowe online,published just before Ramadan(mid August).The plan,hatched in Washington and Addis Ababa,calls for close coordination between the murtad govt.troops,grave worshipper and other clan and warlord militias,kuffar AU troops and Ethiopian forces,to defeat the mujahideen. Though not mentioned in that article,on analysing recent events,it seems that the initial plan to prop up the murtad govt.was based upon expanding the AMISOM mission.BUT AU DOESNT HAV MONEY TO DO THAT,AND DOLLARS SEEM NOT TO BE ENOUGH.IT TURNS OUT BURUNDI HAS BEEN PAYING THE BILLS OF ITS CONTINGENT OF TROOPS IN AMISOM,ON ITS OWN,NOT BY THE WHOLE OF AU. That is why so many players have been brought together to fight the mujahideen,by the kuffar and the murtadeen.
