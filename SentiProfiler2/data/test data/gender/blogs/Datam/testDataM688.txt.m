Waiting for the World Cup is like shoving my face full of Christmas cookies and counting the hours to Christmas. I'm saving my voice up so l can scream my head off like Chewbacca at the vet. Here's a translation for those of you who don't speak Dutch: "The Dutch are driving now... and the ball falls to DeBoer... oh wait, the delivery guy just walked in. Thank you Mr. Delivery man for this giant meat grinder. I'll just... OH MY GOD MY ARM! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! ARRRHHHHH! DEAR LORD! Please someone call an ambulance." On a lighter note, nothing seals a goal like an a little operatic improv. SATAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ..... I'm good! I'm good! How you living, brohaim? ..... { Sigh } Yes. I know you're not technically alive. Don't be snarky. What I mean is, how's it going? What's the 411 on the 666? ..... Oh word? That's cool. ..... Me? Just chillin'. Kicking it at work, you know. Slow motion, playa. Sitting here playing minesweeper, hating on my mark ass buster boss who thinks I'm actually gonna come in on Saturday and work on the big presentation. He's bugging. So wack.Wish I was home blazing an L-Ron Hubbard playing COD4. Instead I'm stuck in this stupid office, on some straight up Dilbert shit. Whatever. It is what it is. How's your day going? ..... That's cool. Hope the rest of the day goes OK for you. I just wanted to call to thank you for the awesome birthday present. So thanks. I dig it! ..... Yes, I do really like it! ..... Stop. It's a great gift. What's not to like? I love McDonald's. I love chatting. How can I not fucking love it? It's easily the best phone I've ever owned. ..... I mean it! I tell ya, it definitely beats the pants off the faggy pocket watch the wife got me. ..... Hahaha! I know, right? What is this, The Industrial Revolution? She must think I'm 158 years old. Why would I want that for my birthday? Get me an Ipod, get me a set of Golf clubs. But why get me a fucking pocket watch on a chain? It's ridiculous. ..... No, no, no. I'm not being dramatic. Satan. She's an idiot. ..... I don't care if it sounds harsh. I married a shockingly stupid person. I think I know why she got me this. But it doesn't make her any less of a retard for doing it. ..... One time I watched "Antique Roadshow" with her and mentioned how old things are kind of cool...you know, just to say something so she wouldn't talk. I didn't really mean it. One little comment and now she thinks I'm Winston Churchill. God, she's dumb. ..... Yes. She is stupid. Just because she got a 1412 on her S.A.T.'s doesn't mean she isn't a freaking r-tard. Those tests are culturally biased anyway. ..... Regardless, the point is the watch she gave me sucks. I suppose it wouldn't suck if I worked on a Steam train inside a Mark Twain novel. But I don't. So that makes her an idiot for giving me Scrooge Bling when it's 2010 outside. Did we lose a war or something? I don't work in a textiles factory in London in 1836. I work here. In a shitty office with fluorescent lights, surrounded by fat nerds and computers that are smarter than me, in a futuristic age of scientific discovery and technological advances, not in the motherfucking past. So, she's an idiot. That's all I'm saying. ..... Well, agree to disagree. Way to take her side, by the way. ..... You are taking her side. Very dickish of you. You can't be the Devil's Advocate. You're the Devil. Choose one and stop being an asshole. ..... Whatevs. Let's drop it. Anyway, Speaking of the ladies, If I tell you something, do you promise to keep it on the D.L. Hughley? ..... Just promise, asshole. I don't care if you're the Devil. You can promise me. ..... Ok. So check it out: You won't believe the amount of Poontang this phone is getting me!!! ..... Yes, bro! I'm not lying! It's silly. I'm like Lorenzo Lamas up in this motherfucker. ..... Believe me. Shorties are feeling the double arches. I'm baggin' digits like the Hamburglar! High five! ..... { Sigh } The Hamburglar? The striped guy who hung out with Grimace and Mayor McCheese and stole burgers? From the McDonald's ads? Jesus Christ, do you get cable down there? ..... Whatever. Google it. All I know is that this Ronald McDonald jump off is totally the new Iphone. Tell everyone. Go blog it out! I just tweeted that shit like 12 seconds ago. ..... Yes I am! I'm calling you from it right now! How rad is that? All hail the Dark Lord! You are truly the Master of Evil and supreme emperor of casual gifting! Booyah! Up top! ..... Listen...I was wondering what you're doing later...See I got these Carrot Top tickets my dickhead boss isn't using, and was wondering if you're not busy torturing the damned tonight if you wanna catch the show with me, maybe catch a brew or two, play some Big Buck Hunter... ..... Oh. Yeah. I'll hold. Pug Life. I watched a ton of figure skating this past Olympics. It's awesome. It's the Freddy Mercury of the Sporting world but with more falling and less good music. (Actually no good music.) I watch it because I like theatricality in my winter sports. I also like sparkly things and public humiliation, so it really works for me. But one thing has me coming back every time: The falls. The falls are so fucking amazing. Some kid from Farawayistan practices tornado jumps and triple lutzes 14 hours a day at gunpoint hoping for the big day when all their work will pay off, only to have life sucker punch them in the grundle precisely at the moment of their promised glory. I feel so bad for them when it happens, but I can't avert my eyes. Talk about having your dreams taken away. And how much must it suck to have Bob Costas narrating your life's single most embarrassing moment. As if you already didn't feel bad enough, now you have a Paddington Bear inspired man child mocking you with a voice beautiful yet full of judgement and disdain. You can almost see God's hand reaching down from Heaven balling up into a giant fist, then obliterating these poor souls until all that is left of them is sadness. Glittery piles of pulverized sadness. That being said I can't help but wonder who feels worse: An ice skater who falls flat on their face in front of millions and millions of disappointed friends, family, and countrymen, or B: Kurt Kobain while watching this video? B. By a landslide. I hope Zombie Kurt Kobain rises from the dead just to eat this man's brains. (via Craplinks ) Fun fact: The well tanned circus bears that raised Dolph Lundgren taught him to sing, dance and ride a unicycle in the hopes that he could put some "threat" back in the term "triple threat". But Dolph learned a lot of from the human world as well, like how to wear a tuxedo and not be afraid of fire. Thus, our hero can make a well dressed torch wielding entrance (at about 0:50). Yes, strange things are afoot on planet Sweden, otherwise known as the Graceland of Scandinavia. From Sweden, we travel half way around the world to St. Petersburg for another world champion of outstanding greatness, Edward Khil. Clear evidence that the iron curtain was an effective policy: This guy was kept in and Yakov Smirnoff was let out. Don't get me wrong, I love Yakov but as the great man himself once said. "In Soviet Russia, you don't laugh at the state of the country and in America no state in the country laughs at you". But, seriously what is up America? We used to lead the world in prodcution of ridiculous variety shows. Giants of the small screen like Laugh-in, the Gong Show and Hee Haw testified to our greatness. Somehow, somewhere between the Jerry Springer and the Backstreet Boys, America lost her way. We've got to get back to simpler times. We've got to strap on a smile, activate the jazz hands and show um what we've got. Come on people, how's about a little less Julius Caesar and a little more Cesar Romaro? Someone's Twitter account just sent me a Viagra ad. (Actually, it was a Viagra knock off. Viagra doesn't need to advertise. But that's not the point. ) The point is this: A human I actually know in flesh form had their microblogging alter-ego possessed by an invisible (yet clearly capitalist) computer-robot, designed with the sole intention of selling me synthetic sex enhancers in pill form while disguised as a person I've known for years, leaving me feeling violated and manipulated. Future: 1, Me: 0. I'm old fashioned, I guess. But I swear that this event is important somehow. My gut tells me it's another sign that robots are taking over the world. And my gut's gut tells him he's probably right. This shit happens all the time to people like us (internet/tech users), but not to those Outlanders who for some reason stay off the grid (non-nerds, seniors, mountain folk). It's weird and unsettling if you step back and think about it. It feels like the old guy that oversees the logic center of my brain just crossed an item off his Armageddon bucket list. You might think I'm crazy. It's just spam. What's the big deal? The big deal is, if this message was sent with exactly the same content but delivered as snail-mail instead, (the kind I grew up with, also known as "mail" mail), I'd only be able to come to the conclusion that someone took my friend hostage and sent me a ransom letter demanding I buy dick pills or else I never get to see him again. We put too much faith into people's social network identities. So what exactly happens to the internet version of you when your friends' internet versions of themselves go missing? Do you call the Architect from the Matrix? Dial 311 and ask for Tron? Put up flyers on Facebook walls until they come back to us? God. It's all so befuddling. I get caveman hands trying to type about it. Just imagine what the grizzle-faced rapey dudes from "Deliverance" would think if you tried explaining this to them. They'd be so mesmerized by the pops and clicks in those fancy college words coming out of your pretty, city-slicker mouth that they might just forget to anally rape you long enough for you to make a run for it. Oh well, I guess it's all inevitable. I'm just glad this particular pirate-tweet is one with health benefits in mind. If I have to have internet ninja robots hacking into my world from now until I die, it's better to have a cool one doing it rather than one of those asshole robots. Because evil or not, a robot that wants to make my penis strong is far more preferable to getting a email confirmation from Skynet telling me they're sending one of their special T-1000 Life Technicians somewhere between 2 and 5 tomorrow in order to disconnect my life service. Well, podcast 2 has arrived in the mail and damn! it's over 30 minutes long. Enjoy. (Click here to get to the Downloadings) (photo via realtybs )
