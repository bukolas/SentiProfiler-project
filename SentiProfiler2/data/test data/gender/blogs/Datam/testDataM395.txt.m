I'm the father of an 8 y/o boy with a learning disability. He has seen a child-psychologist and a neurologist. The neurologist saw my son when he was 6 years old and was very careful not diagnose him. He was under the impression that my son had Dyspraxia and now 2 years later the more we (my ex wife who is a family physician and I) learn on it the more we think our son has it. He is now in grade 2 but his reading and writing skills are at least 2 years behind curriculum. Our son show's no signs of hyperactivity and can concentrate very well when doing tasks such as building LEGO spaceships or Bionicles. He can sit still in front of the television and watch a program or movie for a long time. His mother has been wanting to try and put him on Ritalin in order to help his concentration at school. In light of the very latest news about Ritalin (CTV Canada AM: Tom Kennedy on rejecting Ritalin http://watch.ctv.ca/news/latest/rethinking-ritalin/#clip95418 ) I'm wondering if we really should try medication as the last option for our son and for now to really try to do classroom accommodations and try to see what we could do in order to maximize his learning. My ex also wanted to put our son on bio-feedback but I feel that he really would not understand the principles of bio-feedback at his age in order to make the best use of it. I'm just afraid that his mother might be trying to desperately seek anything that she might think might be useful for our son. I want to try to avoid the panic attacks and go methodically and slowly at what might work best for our son. Also I was wondering if Dyspraxia was a Sensory Integration Disorder. Your input would be greatly appreciated.
