First of all, I love the name of the blog that this cabinet comes from - The Chubby Dove ! Who doesn't love picturing a portly little bird with a paintbrush? I love everything about this restored cabinet, including the color. My current favorite craft paint color is FolkArt Patina , and this is very close. Chubby Dove does a great job distressing and restoring. Go here to read more about it and see it before the jump. In other news, I want to make you aware of a Couture Cardstock review I did for Paper Crafter's Corner . Now that I'm making cards like it's going out of style, I whipped up a few using Couture Cardstock's fantastic line. Go here to see a few more of my projects, and also enter to win some Couture Cardstock product AND a Mod Podge starter pack. Good luck! I must admit that I sometimes overlook doilies. I've been seeing them around a little more than usual for whatever reason, and every craft I've seen them on, I've loved. That includes these tealights and matchbox from the gals at Mint . It's a design that is a worthwhile visit in and of itself, but the fact that they use Mod Podge makes it a must-see. Visit here for a tutorial on the goodies above. I love that they are so dainty and Anthropologie-esque. This is the official bathroom of Mod Podge Command Central. There IS a point to this picture, by the way, not just to show you my toilet. Remember when I did the AllModern.com giveaway not so very long ago? Well, I also ordered a Dwell Studio shower curtain and I LOVE it! My bathroom needed a sprucing and I have always liked Dwell Studio - I was tickled pink to see that Dwell makes shower curtains and one specifically with animals and blues (my favorite color). So here she is . . . what do you think? Anyway, I can't say enough good things about AllModern.com and CSN Stores , who provided the giveaway for you and sent me my shower curtain. They have awesome products. You must go visit them today! Time for the giveaway! I think you remember the rules, but just in case: 1. Comment on THIS blog entry. I LOVE my new shower curtain. What recent purchase or gift do you love? 2. Only one entry per person. 3. Contest will close every Wednesday at midnight (EST). 4. PLEASE leave your e-mail address if it's not attached in Blogger - I need some way to reach you. Last week was awesome - you introduced me to so many tools I hadn't heard of! Last week's winner was Scrap Bat. What is that in the picture you ask? It's a nightstand, done by Chase. Her mom, Amy (who writes the blog Chaser, Boo and Mommy Too! ) is super cool - I wish my mom had let me Mod Podge my furniture! I always enjoy seeing children Mod Podge. If you are a mom and you don't already know, Mod Podge is completely non-toxic and safe for the kiddies. Which I like because then I know it's safe for me too. Back to the dresser - it's very cute and worth a visit here to see more pictures of the action. It's Friday, and that means it's my post for Torendi . That means it's another adventure in cardmaking! The glue is not even all the way dry on this baby because of the last minute button addition: Meet the colorful circus bird of thanks. I had so much fun with this one, because I love the brights. This uses several items from the Torendi March 2010 Kit " Framed Cuteness ." I want to thank you all and the academy for your support as I move through this cardmaking process. I do have a confession though - I didn't use Mod Podge in this project! Before you gasp, keep in mind that it's a challenge for me NOT to. I'm giving away the starter pack today to celebrate Torendi month, and you'll see me resume my Podging again next week. Supplies Cardstock: American Crafts (red), Couture Cardstock (lavender), Sassafrass Nerdy Bird "Sprightly" collection Punch: Fiskars oval scalloped Die Cutter: Sizzix Big Shot, Tim Holtz Alterations Collection Cage Bird Die Stamp: American Crafts Thanks Collection Ink: W R Memory Keepers Tiffany Set Ribbon: American Crafts Allure Paper Flowers: Prima Iced Got Flowers in Tiffany Teal Adhesive: Glue Dots and Tacky Glue Accents: Buttons and Mini Pop Dots And now, the giveaway - the rules are very easy: 1. I'm giving away one starter pack every Friday for the month of March when I post my Torendi card (this is in addition to my typical Sunday giveaway). 2. You must be a US resident, one entry per person. 3. Comment on this blog entry. This week, you have to visit one of the Torendi Design Team blogs (list featured the upper left side of my blog) and tell me one of the projects that you like! 4. Contest ends tomorrow night, 3/13, at midnight EST. BONUS - at the end of this gig, on March 26th, Torendi is giving one of their fab fabrics away to a lucky person who has left a comment on a Friday during the month. AND ONE LAST THING. This month is National Craft Month! Plaid (makers of Mod Podge) is celebrating, so you need to head to their website Plaid Online to see projects like the Fabric Mod Podge wall hangings I did below. Aren't you proud of me? They are also having a huge promotion on craft goodies like Mod Podge so you might wanna stock up. I'm just sayin'! I just recently posted Kristen's owl caddy , but I couldn't just leave it at that. Her site, Kristen Powers Ink , is too intriguing and has too many fun Mod Podge projects. This robox, which is a basically a robot out of a matchbox with some other recycled goods, is an example of one of those projects. You need to go here to learn more about him. He could be a necklace too - go see - you aren't going to believe it. I had the pleasure of discovering Tammy's work on my trip to CHA in late January. There's no other word to describe her than amazing! She did some design work for Basic Grey that I saw at the show, including the piece above (created with their Cappella collection ). The only way to do Tammy justice is to send you to her blog to poke around and see all the beautiful things she's doing. Visit the canvas above right here and a coordinating frame right here . It's all so, so pretty! I don't know about you, but I'm so ready for spring. I'm also ready to fix up the lame, plain clay pots I have housing my plants on the porch of Mod Podge Command Central. I like the ones shown above by Christine of lavender and limes . So simple, so cute and for the small pots you can use one larger scrap of fabric from your stash. For the big pots, you could still use fabric from your stash - just piece it together in patchwork-like fashion. Before you start, head here to Christine's blog to get her step-by-step. Don't forget to use Outdoor Mod Podge - then you can keep these outside without fear.
