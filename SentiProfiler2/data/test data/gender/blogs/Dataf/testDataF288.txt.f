I am a thirty-something wife, stay-at-home mom, school volunteer, community group leader, writer, scrapbooker, jewelry designer. Oh yeah, and I have this chronic, painful disease called rheumatoid arthritis that tries to take all that away from me. This journal is all about me trying to keep it all together while still living a normal life. (Plus bonus literary quotes! What's a former English major going to do without her quotes?)
