I wish I had taken a more proactive approach to my son's eating habits. Being the first-time new mom I did not know what the right quantity of food that should be given to an infant nor did I know how and when to feed the infant. Now after a year and 5 months I realize a few things which I wish I had known earlier. These would have helped my son be a better eater and me a more satisfied mom. 1. Never force feed your baby even when they are tiny babies. That habit must start from the cradle. 2. Kids know when they are hungry. So force feeding will kill their basic instinct. (It is very difficult to get back that instinct). And they will start developing hatred towards food. 3. If you start force feeding during the baby days, you will probably end up like me - always running behind your child during meal times. I dread meal times! Phew! It breaks my back. 4. Kids are not machines or "gunny bags" to eat some standard quantity of food at regular intervals. They will have their own pattern. We could possibly produce food in front of them every three hours or so and let them eat sitting in one place. This pathetic habit of showing some entertainment while eating - SUCKS! Don't even try it. 5. This really limits my ability to travel with my son and generally doing other things because a ) it is hell time consuming b)I donâ€™t think I have the energy left to do anything else after a war with my son. Phew! I wish some day my son and I would break this lousy habit of running around and chasing each other while eating and I wish we would have happier and peaceful mealtimes. God help me!
