The scenery in Library at night. That's all I managed to capture before the Flaming Lamborghini came.

Ahhh where do I begin with the Flaming Lamborghini? How about the recipe? The ingredients are a combination of blue curacao, coffee liqueur (Bailey's and Kahlua's) and erm, yeah. It doesn't sound too bad, but drinking THAT was an adventure in itself.

What happens is the blue curacao is lighted up and goes up in flames. Then they pour the blue liquid through a chute of sorts, and into a small shot of Kahlua's and Bailey's at the end. Once the coffee liqueur has flames on it's surface, you drink it through a straw, all in one gulp.

Goddamn delicious. Hur hur hur. Really, really nice because I love Bailey's. (In other circumstances that would have sounded dirty.)
The schedule is bananas and I haven't had time to do ANYTHING yet! I'm hoping to catch a break tonight or tomorrow afternoon to get on my computer, clean out my email inbox and upload a few pics. So exciting! The kids are having a blast and the tour we are on is SICK.

It's a tour you can't BUY - It's only available through the CEO of Disney. We are being brought in through exits of rides and they are closing down stuff for us to eat in at night. They are supplying snacks and taking us into shows without having to wait on lines. It is incredible!! Oh and we can go on rides a few times - not just once. We get off and then hop right on again. People are very confused watching us!

They have this purple card that they show which is like SUPER DUPER VIP - they said it's how the celebs go through the park. I swear - it is SICK!!

Will update more later.
Faith - The other day someone remarked that I have too much faith in my Guru. Such remarks/comments do keep flying around me all the time. However, this time it set me thinking. Do I have faith in my Guru? And if so and if not, what is 'faith'?  H H Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder of The Art Of Living says "Faith in the divine and faith in one's faith. You know everything is being protected, and everything is being taken care of."

Osho said "Faith is a leap into the unknown".

Both these conceptualizations I could agree with. After all they have been given by spiritual masters ! But conceptualizations are done merely for the benefit of intellect driven humans trying to fathom truth through their cognitive abilities. My agreeing with them or disagreeing with them does not take me any closer or any farther from truth. As truth stands beyond what I agree with or do not agree with. So, do I have faith? Faith in whom, faith in what? Do I have faith in my Guru? Do I have faith in Him? Do I feel that He is with me? I am protected? Or better still do I feel that I am with Him? Both don't seem to be absolutely true. It is neither. Where is He? Who is He? If He is there then He doesn't seem to be with me and it doesn't seem as though I am with Him. He seems so distant. Yet He is!
I stand there shorn of His proximity or distance. I am and He is! He is a part of me, an integral part of me, He is me !! Is it blasphemy to say He is me? I don't know. He is me.
I am also shorn of all protection............ protection from whom, from what. All that is there is a part of me, it is me!
Is this faith ??
So that wasn't so bad. Have had already 5 glasses (small) of beer and feeling supremely woozy. World was all fuzzy, glasses came off (so I don't break it) and face was hot as heck. Things were suddenly really, really niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.

I was talking a fair bit of crap too. Can't remember what I said but judging from the delighted faces of my colleagues, it must have been awesome blackmail material.

And so there I was, singing off-key, swaying to the music (I was swaying anyway from the alcohol) and having shit-loads of fun.

Then the Black Russian came. He took the rest of me to the toilet. In a good way. (Yeah, that sounds dirty NOW.)

But make no mistake. It was DAMN tasty too. (At this point, JA kidnapped my phone to update my Twitter in a most drunken manner, IT WASN'T ME.)
Chile Earthquake and Spiritual Promptings
On the LDS Church News website last week there was an article about the earthquake in Chile and how the mission there had already been preparing for an earthquake in the weeks leading up to the quake. The article is an e-mail written by Sister Lisa Laycock, wife of Chile Santiago East Mission President Larry Laycock, and originally sent to her friends and family after the quake. Here is an excerpt:


"When we were set apart for this calling, Elder [Richard G.] Scott of the [Council] of the Twelve Apostles taught us many important lessons. He spoke from personal experience when he was a mission president in Argentina. One message that he shared with us is this: 'At times, during your mission, you will be awakened in the middle of the night or the early morning hours with thoughts of specific things you should do for certain missionaries. Do not ignore these thoughts. They are promptings from the Holy Ghost who will communicate with you in the stillness of the night or the peace of the early morning hours. He will speak to you then because that is when you are still enough to hear.' Elder Scott further instructed us to keep a notebook beside our bed so that we could record these precious promptings. He said that by the next morning, we would be likely to forget the promptings if we didn't write them down.
"We have been astonished at the fulfillment of Elder Scott's prophetic words. We have received many promptings in the exact manner that Elder Scott described. We are so thankful that Elder Scott taught us how to recognize and act upon these precious promptings. Had he not taught us, we may not have given these promptings the attention they require.
"Nearly two and one half weeks [before the earthquake], I was awakened at around 4 a.m. by just such a prompting. I did not hear a voice, but the thought was as clear as if it had been in the form of spoken words: 'There is going to be an earthquake. Prepare your missionaries.' I sat up in bed and immediately remembered Elder Scott's counsel. That morning I told Larry what had happened. He immediately set to work organizing our missionaries to prepare for an earthquake.
"In talking with our office missionaries to arrange for them to put together a list of everything we would need to prepare...in both Spanish and English...we discovered that the Lord had also let two of our office missionaries know of the possibility of an earthquake (in the form of dreams) and the need to prepare our mission. We set a goal and arranged our schedule so that we could visit every apartment in the mission to check for safety and to review with our missionaries what to do in case of an earthquake. What a wonderful experience we have had as we have met with them and shared scriptures with them about being spiritually and physically prepared. '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear' (D&C 38:30). We instructed every missionary to have a "go-bag" (36 hour kit). We reviewed our emergency action plan with them of where to go and what to do if they had phone service and in case they did not. We gave everyone a paper with all instructions in English and Spanish, and we reminded them that 'this life is the time to prepare to meet God' (Alma 34:32-34). We shared with them our thoughts and feelings about the need for spiritual and physical safety. Some of them became frightened and asked us if we knew something they didn't know. We smiled and repeated '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.' We didn't want to unduly alarm them, but we did want to impress upon them the need to be prepared. We tearfully reminded them of our recent transfer conference where we had shared our feelings about our dear Elder McKay Burrows who was unexpectedly called home in January while serving his mission in Romania...how he was prepared in every way to meet God. We reissued our challenge to 'be prepared' in every way. Then we knelt with them in their apartment and dedicated each apartment, asking for a blessing of safety and security to be upon every apartment.
"When the earthquake came, we were prepared. We did not experience the panic that many felt. We knew we were prepared. Because of the words of the Lord's chosen apostle, Elder Scott, we had listened and heeded the quiet, but clear promptings of the Holy Ghost. We were blessed with peace in the midst of chaos. We learned an important lesson: our preparation helped us to avoid panic and fear, but the Lord, in His wisdom, allowed us to experience enough discomfort to know that He has all power. He is in charge. We are nothing without Him. We are dependent upon Him for every breath we take. Only He can save us from death and destruction. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He is our perfect example. If we follow Him, we will be saved through obedience to the laws and ordinances of His Gospel.
"As the earthquake became more violent, the mission home groaned and wailed. The power died, so the whole city was black. The windows made a hideous screeching sound, and flying objects banged against swaying walls. The printer/fax machine, books, book ends, and fifty-pound television burst from the entertainment center and crashed to the floor, cabinets emptied, drawers flew open, the refrigerator moved, water sloshed out of the toilets, the floor jolted up and down as we ran across it trying to hold onto the walls to keep from falling down, and the piano toppled over like a small toy. As we made our way to the back yard, I remember thinking, 'God is all-powerful. He is our only refuge from this horrible mess.' I prayed and prayed for Him to still the earth. When we reached the back yard, we watched in terror. By the light of the moon we could see the swimming pool water form giant waves and crash out onto the rocks. House and car alarms screamed into the night...some from being crushed by falling debris and others I guess from the bizarre movement of the earth. I am not sure if the intense rumbling sounds came from the earth itself or from everything else that was shaking so violently. Finally, it stopped. When the calm came, we had to sit down because our legs were weak and unstable. My legs stayed wobbly all day and night yesterday. Today (Feb. 28) the muscles in my legs hurt like I ran a marathon. The aftershocks have been extremely unsettling. Each one begins like the one last night started. We just close our eyes and wait to see if it escalates or dies down. I have never experienced anything like this!"
Wow! The description of the earthquake was pretty cool to read, I don't think I would ever want to experience that myself. But the description of how the mission was already preparing for the earthquake was even more amazing. Heavenly Father really cares about us and he does provide us with spiritual promptings if we care to listen. What would have happened if this sister and the other missionaries had decided to ignore the prompting they received? I'm sure all the missionaries and their families are grateful that the three individuals who received promptings to prepare for an earthquake were in tune enough with the Holy Ghost to realize that it was a warning and take action.
One of India’s six largest IT outsourcing companies. Counts such Fortune 500 companies as Sony among its customers. The biggest corporate scandal in India. More than $ 1.5bn of investors’ money dwindled thanks to one family. Rather, one man who famously said, “It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten”. Ya, right. Its my !@#$%^ money, you moron! But guess what’s new? The man is happy, leading the life of a King, though he’s still a B-class prisoner. A B-class prisoner is a habitual offender or a professional crime-doer. Someone who can harm the society in a greater way. He is expected to share his cell with another prisoner. And the well known rule, is that NO electronic gadgets are allowed inside the cell. Our Constitution happens to be the longest and our country, the biggest democracy in the world. “All Men Are Equal Before Law”, did they say?  Some equality, I tell you. A man died in custody after being brutally beaten in the Neelankarai Police Station day before yesterday. For a silly domestic issue. And here’s Mr.SmartyPants who gobbled up MY bloody money, eating a 5 course dinner.
As a blogger of only a few weeks, I'm learning there is a certain etiquette for blogging. (I just scratched my head trying to invent a word like blogiquette, but it didn't quite work as it turns the G into a soft G.) In my surely deluded mind, I'd get hundreds of followers and comments alike, full of praise for my irreverant (am I deluded again?) style of blogging. As I said, this was in my mind. 


What I have learned is this: You won't get followers if you don't follow others. That actually sounds like a life lesson as well doesn't it? Same for comments. So I started following and commenting, and guess what, yay, I got followers and comments. This may be obviously to you lot reading this, but it wasn't to me. I'd previously been used to blogging on my own website for my 4 year old son, full of pictures of what he'd been up to. My readers were my family and friends, living too far away to see us regularly, able to catch up on the blog. But I'd not had to earn readers. I am slowly appreciating that I now have to.
Hot,hotter and hottest Chennai has finally turned into a better place.Thanks to the showers! But despite the rare downpours in Chennai, a few people still despise the rain. I’ve always wondered why people don’t like the rain. Rain enlivens the lifeless earth, gives a fresh look to the otherwise dry leaves, ensures a free supply of  ‘water-the elixir of life’ throughout the year and above all isn’t it beautiful ? Rain has served as an inspiration for many poets independent of the language in which they write. Rain songs have become a part and parcel of every movie just like the item numbers.And, invariably the Rain song is a definite hit! Not just a hit, most rain songs are beautiful too.Is it just the music that brings the beauty ? Definitely not.. Its the rain itself which adds beauty to the song.The rhythm of the rain drops falling, the crystal showers filling the place, the beautiful heroine dancing in the rain.. (does she dance to the song or to the rhythm of the rain ?? .. I’ve always wondered! ) Isn’t it magical ?
When I look back at who I was and how green and naive I was when I entered seminary and first approached the ordination process in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, I am astonished that I made it through the selection process. I believe it was only because the Church's discernment process at that time was rather loose and lacking in rigor (and also rather still functioning as the "old boys' network" now having to figure out what to do with women).

There was still plenty of confusion, mixed messages, and what might, at least in retrospect, seem like warning signals that I did my best to ignore.

The discernment committee suggested that I do a year's internship in a church (five years in a non-church job might have been more appropriate!), because, they judged, that I was "too sweet and inexperience, at least in appearance". While the bishop in charge of the ordination process told me to "go on being your own sweet self"!
When shooting outside at or around twilight, it’s pretty important to know where the sun’s going to go down (or where it’s going to come up). It’s easy enough to look up sunrise/sunset times, but the sunset/rise moves across the horizon throughout the year.

This took some digging to find, but it’s actually very easy to figure this out. You’ll need:

This link to the NOAA Solar Calculator
A compass, which you can get pretty much anywhere.
Then do this:

Find your location (the location where you’ll be at sunse) on the map in that link
Enter the date you’re interested in
Note the sunset time. Under “AZ/EI” you’re getting a degree measurement, which is what we need eventually; but it’s actually showing the current azimuth instead of the azimuth at sunset.
Enter the sunset time in the time fields next to the date fields. The AZ/EI field will update. That’s the number you’ll need.
The number you’ve just found should be a degree measurement, between 0 and 360. This is the solar azimuth angle at sunset. Generically, an azimuth is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. The solar azimuth is calculated (by the application at that link, anyway) as the number of degrees clockwise from true north that corresponds to the position on the horizon that the sun is directly above. If that seems confusing, it’s because it is. On the bright side: it’s really easy to work with when you get to where you want to shoot:

When you get to your location, take out your trusty compass and:

Align the compass with magnetic north
Find the degree measurement on the compass that matches the number you got earler
That direction is pointing toward where the sun will go down.

There’s definitely a margin of error here. First, this doesn’t account for topography getting in the way (if you’re next to a mountain, the sun will go behind it long before it’s “down”, so the angle will be off). Second, the compass is reading magnetic north instead of due north, and the reported azimuth is measured from due north. But: it’s free, it’s pretty easy, and for my purposes, it’s good enough.
The other day a random thought crossed my mind while scanning through some photos of a friend…When was the last time i opened a album ? (i mean the paperback ones) God,it’s been so long ago..I can’t even remember now..Digital camera’s just spoilt us crazy..  I remember when we would just click pictures with our Minolta camera and wait desperately to receive the photos from the studio just to see how they turned out…That excitement is dead now..No curiosity ..nothing   Forget the inquisitiveness,that is an attribute long dead anyway…but the fact that you can sit on your favourite chair with a photo album and a cup of tea to remember the funny and happy times on a rainy evening..is just priceless…  I am not against digital camera’s…I love them! But the feeling when you can open  an album and reminisce is extraordinary…   Now for the smart ones out there..yeah yeah..just print the photo out…(i know that!) …but really how many of us do that? we just keep gaping at the photos on our laptops …!!!   I miss having pictures adorning my wall!  Pictures of you…and me
Yes, there’s a pattern in the plots of all his books. But that’s how it is for 90% of writers across the globe. The bad ones included. We’re all people who wish to express ourselves and that shines through our words. Have you ever noticed that you use a limited set of words in your life. This even if you might have mastered your copy of Barron’s to flog the US consulate later. You think he’s all fascinated about the IIT/IIM atmosphere? Welcome to the world of Indian Chick-lit. India is one crazy nation churning out engineers mindlessly. Parents throw their kids into IIT/PMPD coaching centres in 7th grade. Why, it starts with Abacus classes in 1st grade these days. So why not? We’re talking of a sizeable target audience here. And besides, if we could lap up Miss.Kaavya Vishwanath’s stolen tale simply because A.She’s an ABCD and B.She’s from Harvard, I don’t see a reason not to love Chetan Bhagat. My personal favorite. I adore his female lead characters. They’re not silly nitwits (there are other women to make up for it) but are bold, career driven and they know exactly what they want out of life. Which, is the reality today.
Holiday Sneer 

It's always funny to me when people wish me a merry Christmas. I mean, I can understand the whole holiday spirit and cheer and whatever, but the whole thing means nil to me. However, I did watch so many hours on the Discovery Channel about the life of Jesus, Mary, and everything else surrounding the New Testament that the Disocovery Channel could muster. I watched so many hours, in fact, that I had a dream last night that I was Mary, Noah (of the Arc), and Jesus rolled into one. 

For Xmas eve I went over to my friend Ridge's house in Queens. We watched Peanuts cartoons, Edward Scissorhands, and ate Jumbalya or whatever it's called/spelled. Afterwards I headed back into the city a little earlier than planned and had a quick drink with Marc. I also tried to climb into his suitcase so he could take me to Australia with him for when he goes to interview the Vines. As I was heading back home, my brother Lawrence called me just as I was driving past him on the street in my cab. I jumped out and joined him for a drink at some cheesy club that was hosting a Matzoh Ball. It was so incredibly lame (I yelled out "Sausage Fest!" as i walked in and got shot with dirty looks all around) that we left after 20 minutes. He headed off to the new Crobar and I went home. Apparently the Lubuvatch Organization were in their Mitzvah Mobile outside of Crobar trying to recruit new followers of the ultra-orthodox jewish cult-like group. When I was little my mom used to take me to visit Rabbi Schneerson (sp?) who is the person the Lubuvatch's look up to as a sort of profit. We'd wait in a long line in Brooklyn for hours and hours and walk up to him, hand him a dollar, he'd give us a blessed dollar in return, mumble something or another, and then we'd go off on our way. I was about 8 years old when we did this, so my memory is a bit cloudy... however, I'm sure he brought happiness to a lot of people. I'm just confused by what the Lubuvatch community is trying to do with their Mitzvah Mobiles... i should do some research. 

Speaking of Lawrence, he changed his friendster photo to images from high school. He was so fucking cute and new wave. Look!. 

Yesterday, for Xmas Day, Nate the fabulous Roommate, cooked an amazing meal for his bandmates. It looked amazing... I couldn't eat it cause it wasn't kosher, but basically it was chicken rolled with ricotta and feta cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Nate cooks! He's like the best boy in the whole world. He also got a Christmas tree for the apartment which he decorated with white lights and blue balls (to pay respect to Hannukah), and we made an angle for the top using an image of Thom Yorke i found in Blender magazine. 

After dinner I went to the movies with Karen and Jordan to see "Big Fish" (I was crying like a pms-ing girl who has just watched a Sally Struthers "kids in africa need your money" commercial at the end... not to mention squealing everytime Ewan came on screen). We all noticed Drew and Fab in line for popcorn behind us and so this prompted Jordan to ask quite loudly while we were sitting down "I THOUGHT DREW AND FAB WERE OVER?" not noticing them sitting two rows directly in front of us. God Bless Jordan for delivering the quote of the night. So Drew and Fab are back on! 

 
When I got home, after going to Lit, I watched the World Idol competition that i had taped while at the movies. I'm totally in love with Kurt from Norway's performance. He was so utterly amazing. He sounded a lot like the singer of Kent. I think i'm gonna buy his album. 

 
Free Jack White items are for sale just in time for belated holiday gifts. Incase anyone is interested, i'm a women's medium. Thanks to Rachel for that link. 

Finally -- I'm DJing at Don Hills on New Years Eve. The party is apparently gonna be really great, so if anyone reading this needs something to do that night, you should go. Come and say hi to me if you do! I will probably be very drunk and possibly try to make out with you and then you'll also discover my inability to remember anything and total need to document everything with my digital camera as a result. I promise to also play "Ice Ice Baby."
It has become a common sight to see children as young as 5 years old in the spotlight singing and dancing to the latest film songs, dolled up in fancy clothes and layers of makeup, trying to behave very much like adults- tinsel town adults at that. While the tremendous talent demonstrated by most children is truly amazing and applaudable, it is debatable whether it is ethical of us to push children into a commercial world of make believe, where their talents are being harnessed into making money. Also on the downside, the children are being subjected to stress beyond their years and maturity levels and also, in some cases, to abuse. It comes down to us to sort through the goods and evils of reality shows and come up with some very necessary decisions – should reality shows for children be encouraged or banned? Should we come up with stricter measures to ensure the well being of the child participants? 
the place is Residency...that is where this picture is shot. in 1857, when India fought against the British, the Indian Army attacked the Residency in Lucknow, where the British forces luxuriously resided. this particular grave is of a man called M. V. Nazareth who died on 5th August,1890 and was one of the defenders of residency during the seige of 1857.he was 75 years 8 months and 26 days, when he died...he was survived by his daughter who mourned him deeply. He lost his wife, Eliza Carina in the seige of 1857, who was 36 years 2 months and 8 days when she died.  Moving on to read the epitaph of Late Mr. M. V. Nazareth...
"ONE JUST SHALL REJOICE IN THE LORD, AND SHALL HOPE IN HIM,
AND ALL THE UPRIGHT IN THE HEART SHALL BE PRAISED."

Now reading the epitaph of Mrs. Eliza Carina...
"THOU HAST PROTECTED ME FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF THE MALIGNANT,
FROM THE MULTITUDE OF WORKERS OF INEQUITY."

There are profound thoughts that this post can leave to you...i do not know if the ones that come to me are justified or not. Do bother to leave your thoughts here and share them with me.
I am sure a lot of people attending training would have posted about the nature of training, some maybe even about training especially at Haldia. The very reason I started to blog from our training premises is because I wanted to get over my frustration. So I’ll stick to the positives. Food, Learning and Entertainment is definitely not going to be a part of it. Sorry guys, the less said the better. Being at Haldia,I’ve learnt to manage things myself,manage finances et all.But, I would have done that anywhere.Whats specially positive about Haldia ? Right,It is a village, but its not all that pollution-free or clean-green.Thanks to the industries.They spew fire 24×7 and contribute to more holes in the already hollow ozonosphere.Nothing positive yet ? Wait for it! The people are the asset of this village (teenage guys excluded).Innocence personified.Their life is simple and they have no reason to complain.Born and brought up in a city for 22 years, our life looks so complicated when compared to theirs.
Forgiven not Forgotten 1
The meeting of the Indian Council of Textile Owners had just dispersed. The lounge of the hotel ‘Grandeur’ was filled with rich businessmen, old and young alike; the young entrepreneurs were being introduced to the elder members by the Chairman, Mr. Ashok Sahai.
At the centre of the lounge stood Mr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, surrounded by a group, consisting of the richest members of the council. He needed no introduction. The Jindal Textile Corporation had been the most powerful and successful industry in India for the past 15 years and had only doubled in its value ever since Mr.Ryan inherited it after his father five years back. Ryan had been an MBA fresher when he took up the responsibility; everybody knew there was something else in the man that made him what he was- the king of the Jindal empire. He had the strong and slender build of an athlete and was dressed in a black suit tailored to perfection. His body looked chiselled, with not a single vestigial muscle. His face was angular with a sharp, pointed nose.he had black curls that fell over his broad forehead. And his eyes… people who conversed with him rarely looked at his eyes, they made one uncomfortable. They played a huge contrast to the sophistication and aristocracy his clothes displayed. On the surface, they were insolent and impersonal, but anyone with a little more insight could see that they were only a screen to something more savage and terrifying, like the fores of nature bottled up in human form. 
At present, he was completely bored of the flattery he was being entitled to by a group of businessmen around him. They were saying something about him being the responsible son and the future badshah of the textile world. He smiled and nodded appropriately to all the comments, but his eyes were shifting, scrutinising the groups of people around the room. Suddenly they fixed onto someone, someone standing with Mr. Ashok, being introduced to some others. His eyes never lost sight of her for a moment. He stared at her as she stood there- tall, slender- a picture of elegance. Her face wore a smile- a smile that reflected beauty and self- confidence, but more than everything, they deepened her eyes and the colour on her cheeks. A simple sari of blue silk adorned her, but she looked like she would hardly have looked less elegant in a pair of jeans or trousers.
For a few moments, Ryan looked at her and then turned back to the conversation immediately around.
After a quarter of an hour, he heard Mr.Ashok’s voice, “Mr.Ryan, may I introduce to you Miss.Tamanna, and Ms...”. “Mr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, I know him quite well, Mr.Ashok.” “That’s my pleasure, Ms.Tamanna.” Ryan stretched out his hand, his eyes looking straight at her as if he were challenging her. She met his eyes with defiance and took his hands coolly. Even as their fingers touched, his palm enclosed hers. The warmth from him seemed to spread all through her. Her eyes wavered just an instant and she was the first one to withdraw her hands. 
For a moment there was troubled silence, and then Tamanna composed herself and managed a weak smile, “Nice to meet you Mr.Ryan”.
“Of course, Ms.Tamanna, looking forward to see more of you.”
In sometime, Ryan took leave. He never stayed back for the Council dinners. As he walked back towards his car, he thought of her again. There was something about her, in her poise, but she had wavered from that at his touch. The thought made him happy, though no girl had ever resisted his touch. But he knew this had been different. She had been genuinely surprised, perhaps troubled, at her own response. He would find out more soon.
Thinking so, he directed his remote at his car. Something was wrong, it refused to open. He pressed again, no response. “Is anything the matter, Mr.Ryan? That’s my car.” Tamanna stood loking at him, hands folded, a smug smile on her face. Now it was his turn to be genuinely surprised. “This is your car?” He had every reason to be surprised. The car was the first of its kind in India and he had been the first Indian to get it. He loved cars, especially, huge, black ones. He would never have imagined anyone elseat the Council to have ever owned one like that. She broke into his reverie, “If you’ll please excuse me,” and she pressed the button on her remote. The car dutifully opened its door for the rightful owner. As she walked past him to get into the car, he involuntarily shifted aside, and saw his car parked some 100m away. “Good night, Mr. Ryan”, she said and just sped off.
For one moment he stood dumbfound and then a smile crossed his lips, a cold, cruel smile. He had discovered what was different about her. After a long time, he had been challenged. He felt a gush of adrenaline. She was an independent will, a tigress. He would possess her, he decided, “Very soon…”, were the only words that came out of his mouth.
Music - The fact that we have something called music to appreciate is utterly amazing…I consider it one of the ingenious things we discovered(mind you..not invented).The right music just lightens up your day! It still amazes me as to how we react emotionally to different frequency of sounds…how do we do that ? hmmm..I am no scientist so won’t delve any deeper :)  I know that the genre of music is a touchy subject for some…for example: i am not a fan (at all) of heavy metal…I detest it..but doesn’t mean i wont allow anyone else to decide for themselves.  Personally i have no particular genre to call ‘my kind of music’,it all depends on my mood…when i am up for it..I enjoy mostly romantic and soulful music..but i also enjoy R&B,Bollywood and Pop a lot too..Of late..soft rock and punk rock have caught my eye(Green day :) )  Anyway that’s a lot about me…just one question…how many of you out there listen to a particular song a million times till you are fed up? (that is my exact story..yeah i am quite boring! :p)  Coming to favorites I have way too many…so many that they can’t even be called favorites anymore.. :) Music can REALLY heal..it’s just a matter of listening to the right songs  so go pick up your i-pod,phone,laptop(or any other instrument that plays music) and get happy!
Calling all Moms
I know it's been awhile since I've blogged. Things have been a little crazy lately. More on that later.

Now, I have two questions for all you moms out there. Eli is turning 1 next month (how did that happen?!?) and so I need to start looking for a new car seat for him. I don't know much about the next size. I've heard things about 3-in-1 and booster-convertible or whatever, but I really know nothing. So, rather than researching like I should, I thought I would just ask:

1) What kind of a carseat do you recommend for a 1+ year-old?

I don't really want to spend a fortune, but at the same time, I know it will get used through the years, so I don't mind investing in something that will last.

Next, I need ideas on food. I seem to be a little stumped on what to feed Eli lately. I know there are probably lots of things I'm not thinking of. He LOVES to feed himself and is not so keen on the purees anymore (mostly because I have to feed him), but he only has 4 teeth, and he's not a year old yet, so there are things he can't eat yet, so I need ideas. His favorite things lately (finger foods) are avocados, bananas, crackers, cheerios, and peas. I'm still breastfeeding, so he gets a lot of his nutrition from me, but we are nearing the weaning phase, so I need to find more balanced things to give him. So, the next question:

2) What foods (finger foods mostly) do you recommend for a 10+ month-old?

Okay, I'm ready for the suggestions now. :) I've seen other people do things like this on their blog, and I'm always amazed at the awesome responses, so I'm counting on you! Any and all comments are welcome (even if you don't have children). Thank you! :)
The Kitchen Cure
A couple of years ago, my husband and I received a trip to a spa as an anniversary gift. This is not the kind of place where you lie a reclining chair and get a gentle massage, a pedicure and a facial. We arrived at this place at 7 o'clock in the morning and became inmates. They locked up our things. We each talked to a medical doctor. After we received a personalized schedule of treatments, we were nudged into the labyrinth. The inmates, stripped of our belongings, were shuffling around in matching slippers and white bathrobes. No one spoke. It was Fellini-esque. The experience was jarring and liberating at the same time, since we were subjected to being pummeled with streaming jets of water at fire-hose velocity, dipped in vats of bubbling clay, massaged with compounds, stretched with weird machines, closed up in rooms of various degrees of heat and coldness, scraped, kneaded, and otherwise indelicately handled. Loic and I were separated at arrival and raised our eyebrows at each other in passing down the halls throughout the day. We were then left to silently bake together in a cloistered courtyard, exhausted, draped over reclining chairs overlooking the Mediterranean sea, drinking cups of healing water that were refilled by nurses. It was all we could do to make our hands touch each other across the great divide between our wooden recliners while we watched the sun set. We left that place completely drained of all energy but in the weeks to come, wow! The difference was amazing.

Fast forward to today. Since we bought the country place a bit over a year ago, our apartment in Lyon has entered a sort of Feng Shui limbo. Especially the kitchen. We didn't put much thought into how to establish the new kitchen in the mountains, nor did we give furnishing it a line in the household budget. Instead, we shuffled and shuttled things from one place to another in boxes and bags for awhile, then hit the brocantes and doubled certain small things like corkscrews, knife sharpeners and silverware. But since this wasn't thought out or planned in any way, things settled the way they fell. Add to that the arrival of our son, Ian, last spring, adding baby accoutrements and products that never found their places and a vast cut in spare time even to consider the issue, and we've got ourselves a nice big mess. I've been trailing along behind in the wake of all of this. I haven't had the courage to even address the general dysfunction, I just feel more and more like I need a helping hand. This was why, when I came across the 2010 Kitchen Cure at Apartment Therapy, I took the plunge.


They told me I had to dispose of my lovely olives.

Our kitchen is extremely small, and I like it that way. For years, it was a very efficient one. But now it feels like an abandoned rats nest, for all the things I've stolen from it to nourish the kitchen in the mountains. All the bits and scraps of useless junk that remain tucked into every corner have lost their meaning. In addition to problems with clogged energy, I really am going to have to replenish the spirit of my kitchen. I want it to be a place that nourishes my creativity again.

The first assignment at the Kitchen Cure is to tackle the refrigerator and the pantry, removing everything that's expired, inedible, or no longer useful. One shelf at a time, we purge things that no longer belong there, and brush the dust off of that which we will keep. We have a week to do this. This is a task that just takes time. In my house, the kitchen and pantry have begun to spill out into our living space. This first step will make space and find places for the many things that seem to never have had a place to begin with. It will give me a chance also to replenish the essentials.
Haappie haapie new year - ;) well u kno there is an old sayin " Whatever u begin on the new year flourishes" ;) in t same hope, well i m blogging today in the hope that i ll blog regularly ;P yu c i m very buzzzy ma....don get much of tym! :P lols

Neways,I wanted to write on a long promised post, The child in u....Well, i m still nt findin t ryt mood for it....for wen i write it i want it t be in my flow, n its a post tat i hold v close to my heart, that i cant write it without the ryt mood....

So i m gonna skip tat post for nw n write about sumthin tat everyone needs in their lyf..Hope...Well, i guess i m pretty obsessed with the law of attraction, that it is featurin in every other post! :) 

Lets dig a bit deeper on this old sayin, y ppl insist v start on new yr, new beginnin et al...well hidden beneath all this is a basic and primal instinct...Hope,Enthusiasm and Agape...ny1 who ve read paulo cohelo will kno all about agape...well agape is an extended form of enthusiasm, a feeling of joy hope and belief......Lemme quote a truth that is true in all cases..Faith is the burning force behind everything...Anyone, ryt frum agnostics to atheists to deep believers one thing is common..Faith..Faith needn be on lord..For us weak beings, who cant focus on a singlke point, we need an idol, a place of worship, a point to focus on called god..A superior power who we need to c n feel..

In my opinion atheists and agnostics are more deep believers, for they can focus without seeing and feeling..They trust..in themselves and keep pushin themselves..They are more stronger mentally..Denyin the existence of god doesn mean He doesn exist...He is there..In faith..The belief..

Explorin more on faith, havent v heard stories of healing and belief, of extrordinary circumstances, jus based on belief?? Kamalahasan, who s well known t be an atheist, is he nt successful!!? he is...cos he has faith in himself and his profession...Where faith is, there is excellence..

One may wonder y i m goin on n on about faith n belief..For on this nw yr,all i wanna share with u is that wonderful feeling called belief...faith...Jus believe in whatever u want...Close ur eyes, visualize and feel it..never give up and never lose hope...Be happy for all u have and believe u ll get whatevr u want..this is nt philosophy...it is t underlyin truth behind all relegions..Jus believe, take lyf in its stride and trust...Enjoy every moment..This is not jus for t new yr...U follo this everyday will be a new yr to u... 

Stay Young @ heart for that is t most important thing in lyf!! Havve fun.. A happy happy new year to all :)

Cheers!

New Beginnings

My contract says I start on July 1st...but today, I found the familiar dance beginning. Checking with this person, that person, writing notes here, there....wondering...what implications for doing this, that... Back in the swing of things. But in a new place.
My new position. Hmmmm.....due to start in a couple days, but already, this whole thing has started. "What time will you be in?" my secretary to-be-asks. "Uh, I'll see you tomorrow....9 a.m." I say. And I mean it. Work is waiting.

I met the person who held my new post today. He had served for 17 years...the equivalent of a high school junior's lifetime...so hard to believe. I knew how I had felt, leaving Greenville after one year; Central Montcalm after 5....so how could I really know his story? Leaving after all those years. It had to be hard. He said he has plans to do "other things", yet, I know it had to about kill him. To leave things in my hands. And now, all the things he worked so hard for...will they continue, or not? 

I appreciate all he did for me. He went beyond really, what he needed to do. I don't take all that lightly. He seemed non-affected, but he had to feel a little void. And I can't blame him.
Amy Butler
I was able to meet designer Amy Butler at a local quilting shop. She was vey nice and gave me a signed pattern for her cute Butterfly and Lady bug pillows.

Too bad Lydia had to miss the fun since she was getting ready for her cruise. :)

Bradford's in Ghana

Well, we sent off our first missionary. Bradford left Thursday for Ghana.

It's very exciting. All missions are wonderful. The service you give, the growth you make, the testimonies grown, the life changes made, the truths learned and the covenants accepted. He will have challenges but we expect it to be a wonderful time for him.

I made a new blog for his mission. missionarychambers.blogspot.com I just put his addresses up there. I was having trouble up loading photos so that will have to wait until another day.

Primary Temple Trip
Our Primary had a great temple activity in September. It is the 10th anniversary of the Columbus Ohio Temple.

Here's the whole crowd, the Powell Ward Primary. Ellery and the other 11 year old boys were at a campout. Too bad They missed it this was a very special.

Patrick loves the temple. He was very excited to go and learn about the temple.


Here's my handsome Owen. He was so reverent.


We toured around the temple and learned new things on each side of the temple. We enjoyed the gardens and heard the former Temple President and his wife speak too.

Patrick broke his leg early in September. He and Owen were jump ing off the back porch. It didn't really slow him down too much.
Thanks Quinn for letting Patrick use your wheelchair!

He has this spiffy new cast for the next three weeks.

Little Zoo Trip
Patrick and Owen at the zoo

Patrick has been waiting and waiting for a trip to the zoo. Yesterday we went for a couple of hours.

We rode the train. They have never done that before. It was fun!
Let's Talk About Food And Health
David Jesse's recent article at annarbor.com about a Mitchell Elementary School program to provide weekend "food backpacks," made me think it is time to say something more about food, and health. 
Different schools and school districts have different feelings about how much they should help provide a safety net for students. Some schools have stepped up to the plate--for instance, Bryant/Pattengill in Ann Arbor runs a clothes closet, and the Ypsilanti Public Schools run one for the whole district. Other schools have been reluctant to jump into providing services, because the need is so great, and they don't want to be seen as a giant social service agency.

On the other hand--kids who are hungry, cold, or sick don't do very well in school. I think that those schools that try to support students' other needs are doing the right things. But remember, knowledge is power, and a lot of people who are eligible for programs don't know they are eligible. So here are a few resources. Please share them!

1. Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program (which includes breakfast): you can register for this at any time during the school year. If, for instance, you had work at the beginning of the year and wouldn't qualify, you might find that you qualify now. Ask for an application at the front office of the school your child attends. Some schools use this as a way to identify kids who qualify for other benefits/scholarships. (I've written about school lunch here.)

2. The Food Stamp application is now online. This is new, and it is great news. Spread the word. A lot of people are surprised to find out that they qualify. If you want an estimate as to whether your family will qualify, here is the link to a food stamp calculator. And here is the link to the application. 

3. Similarly, you can now enroll your kids in the MIChild/Healthy Kids program with an online application. (Women 19-44 can be enrolled in the Plan First family planning program through the same application.)

4. The Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools has clinics in several local schools, including schools in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Willow Run. Check them out here.

5. Pregnant women and kids up to age 5 can be served by WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)--and that can help stretch the overall food budget. WIC also has some satellite clinics, which is helpful for people living on the edges of the county.
“Rich and creamy New York-style cheesecake swirled with pureed fresh strawberries and a hint of lime juice, all nestled in a buttery graham crust” beamed the lunch special menu. S was wowed. Well who wouldn’t be, look at the picture! She changed her order from bread and Earl Grey tea  to just the dessert. The waitress gave an understanding nod, openly feeling sorry for S’ state, the lonely vegetarian with meager choices and magnanimously approved S’ desperate attempt to fill her grumbling stomach with something. The cake looked big and S considered that she might be overestimating her appetite. “Big deal! It’s a piece of cake , how filling can it be?”  she thought, brushing such preposterous thoughts away. The waitress  brought the cheesecake ceremoniously and with a wink and a patronizing pat, left it on the table and busied herself with the arduous task  of filling the giant glasses with sparkling water and a slice of lemon.  The ambrosial aroma of freshly pulverized luscious strawberries blending with the citric tanginess and the curdled creaminess of the cold cheese tingled S’ nostrils and her pleasantly awoken taste buds without fail began their task of salivating. She took in the deliciously beautiful pink, white and brown on the swanky porcelain plate for a minute. Choosing the spoon was a feat of unimaginable controversies. All the high-society spoons made her uncomfortable for they resembled normal spoons in their design and dimensions save one or two tweaks in the whole shape of the spoon; and it looked more like the spoons were mutilated in an uncanny manner rather than made chic to reflect the sophistication of the place. Sighing , she picked the one that seemed closest to the fork family and dug right in.  In her first mouthful, she couldn’t help let out a low moan. It was THAT good. The strawberries were so fresh that it appeared like they were picked right then from the invisible fields behind the “Only Authorized Personnel” door and the corporate glass and plastics. The cheese was so creamy that she had to wonder what good deeds she had done over her different lifetimes and merits she had earned from the guy above that such a palatable pleasure was bestowed upon her. The cheese was so rich that she had to wonder what good deeds she had done over different lifetimes and merits she had earned from the guy above that such a palatable pleasure was bestowed upon her. The crust was light as air and the mocking hint of lemon danced lightly between spoonfuls. Her tongue had seen paradise.  The cake actually slipped from her mouth to the foodpipe, it was that flawlessly smooth. For the next few minutes, nothing in the physical world was actually perceivable except the wonderous dessert. Then suddenly her taste buds grumbled. They were saturated with the sweetness, they complained. Come on, S pushed. But she knew she was wearing herself out, she was exhausted from the creaminess of the cheese. Every mouthful introduced a fresh blast of the thin crust and the rich creamy cheese that felt like a blow and knocked her out. She tried everything , drinking sips of ice cold water, making conversation with the people sitting around her, interspersed with a million tongue clicks to free it of the sultry sweetness and the heavy aftertaste. It was impossible. All right, she decided. It’s you against me. The cake smiled back peacefully. She took a deep breath in and downed 3 spoonfuls blindly. Then drank water at once. Whew! She opened her eyes to see that the cake was hardly half done. Oh no! Her colleagues had started their main course already, after soup and starters. And she was still stuck with this royal cake which she had received even before the others’  starters had arrived. It was then when her stomach grunted. “I’m full! Stop stuffing me”, it instructed. She knew she had to ,but she couldn’t stop.  She had to finish what she had started. ” I cannot be defeated by a cake, and a cheesy one at it.” she declared. But she revamped her strategy and decided to tackle it one spoonful at a time, chanting ‘I can do this’ every time. The cake smiled back ruefully. After an hour, she looked proudly at the pink -white-brown crumbs sticking on the plate. And even though her motor skills were temporarily incapacitated and she couln’t move, she had finished the Colossal Strawberry Daiquiri Cheesecake for good. “Big deal! It’s a piece of cake , how filling can it be?” She shook her head and took out her red wallet.
golden era What life had got for me was the greatest tension wen i finished my high school. Engineering was for sure but which college was like picking one chocolate out of a 100. I was always in the lost world as to where to go,and who will accept me..hmmmpf finally i'm here in this place which i have hated at times but the place i said hi to real life... The first day of college was a real confusion to me.It was a whole new place with total strangers.But it didn't take time to get to know people. The first day I talked to 2 girls in my class and it was very strange how we became very close in a very short period of time. i was the naughtiest of the 3 and yet both of them were caught always. everybody thought i was the very silent and quiet type..lol...all the teachers thought we were naughtier than the boys(they were actually the silent type though.)
Was ragged by seniors,time passed. it was time we had to split to different departments. we had a farewell in the class. We had fun everybody had to do a task. All of them made me do aerobics in class(was quite embarrassing to do it in front of the whole class). Then we entered the second year. life became busy and we saw less of each other. I met new people.it was quite tuff to cope up with new syllabus new teachers, totally new people but as we got to know each other it was fun. exams, symposiums,friends...i really donno if time flew or i lost track of it.. Now i am in the final year and i really miss college and hostel when i go home. i always wait to come back. i find it really strange how these people totally unknown to me became a very special part of my life. All these days were fun filled totally. Who will know what sorrows are when u have friends like mine.
It is very hard for to believe that there are only six months for the golden moments. no more last benches, no more bunking classes, no more canteen, no more teasing,no more birthday treats,no more commenting on teachers. Just can't explain how much fun all this was. amidst all these there were petty fights, after which we kept our egos at bay and hugged each other and cried. all of us had a shoulder and ear to lend for each other always. Hey guys who have influenced my life so much this is for you.... Thanx for being with me in sun and storm... every little thing you do means a lot to me. And yes i will miss all of you and all of this when i am graduated. tears fill my eyes when i even think of the day.There is so much u have taught me.

dedicated to all my frens:
preethi , abirami & anusha - the people who taught me to stay cool. life is short enjoy life to the max.
sharmila,subashree, viji,krithika,Ramya,Aarathi -people who taught me that life was practical.
Sundari and Surya-two people who make my day by fytng wid me. jus cant stay widout fytng wid them silly fights though..
deepika,sirisha,pooja,geethanjali-people who taught me to take life as it comes.
ravi-the person who never lets me down,always keeps me cheerful.
and there are other people who have influenced me. they are too many to pen.
hey guys the amount of encouragement and support you have given me is what makes me feel the way i am today. Its you people along with my family who have stood by me as a strong support during my hard times... Thanx once again and love you all.
Stuck in Legal Marketing Limbo? Here are Answers.
Imagine the scene … members of the law firm’s Executive Committee sitting around a conference table, unable to reach agreement on which legal marketing programs to implement. There are so many choices now, from Google AdWords to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other forms of social media. 

Legal marketing used to be simple. The Yellow Pages served as a leading advertising channel for personal injury attorneys, while a basic website and nice brochure met the marketing needs of most plaintiff or defense law firms. Add in a strong referral network, and the average law firm of 20 years ago was able to keep the phones ringing without too much work. 

How times have changed! Effective legal marketing now involves many specialists, from search engine optimizers to video technicians and website analytics experts. Of course, you still need copywriters, graphic designers, and event coordinators. 

Today’s competitive marketplace frequently delivers business to the law firms that can master marketing, rather than the best law firms. Does all this sound familiar? 

Avoid Inaction in the Face of Uncertainty

Confusion is a common response I see among lawyers struggling to select the best marketing approach. A natural tendency under these circumstances is for the law firm to either do nothing, or to continue with the same tired marketing techniques that deliver unsatisfactory results. 

Marketing your law firm is a critical issue, and the economic downturn has left many firms scrambling to fill their pipeline. There is no time to wait. The good news is that there is a silver lining in the rapid changes of technology and promotional techniques. 

Let the Market Guide your Promotional Campaigns

Rather than fighting with your law partners over who has the best marketing ideas, turn to the marketplace for answers. Marketing is both art and science, where only actual response rates can truly determine the best promotional campaigns for your law firm. 

Develop a plan to systematically test new or modified marketing strategies, keeping those that work and discarding the rest. Internet marketing offers an unprecedented ability to monitor campaign performance on an almost real-time basis, so you will be able to compare response rates and client acquisition costs across multiple promotions. 

Smart Choices in Budget Allocations

Your marketing budget should be spread across an integrated set of marketing channels (i.e., Internet, sponsorships, events, and advertising) and scheduled against a written timeline with specific goals. Remember that current clients are your best source of new revenue, so be sure to earmark funds for client retention. Take advantage also of the many free or low cost legal directories offered by firms like Avvo, Justia and HG.org to easily increase your online visibility.

Jeeves wouldnt eat on time. He wont play with me. He spent all his time with that big black dog. Things were working out well for both of them until Jeeves's girl started seeing someone else . A big light brown handsome dog. Jeeves was furious and ended up fighting with that dog all the time. It took sometime for Jeeves to get over the pain of losing his love. ( Seriously LOL.. How much drama involved in a dog's life! ) Anyways he is happy with his new girl now :) With the passage of time i observed too many changes in Jeeves' behaviour . He grew from a mature , poised dog into a naughty and playful dog. ( How cool is that!) He plays like a kid. Drags doormats , hides under the bed , chases cats around (that is so like a dog) and so on . He used to be this BIG foodie who lived for eating and all of sudden he became damn stubborn and choosy. He acquired a habit of running away from food and i had to follow him all the way to make him eat. Whew! that was a quite a chase!!
And luckily I did not use plurals to describe them both. Or I would have died from an alcohol overdose. HAHAHAHA - okay, not funny actually. Ahem.

Yesterday, 5th of March, 2 days post-birthday: Colleagues JA, Ivn, Rchd, LJS and CK conspired to intoxicate me to the extent I start dancing on poles. KR was designated 'drive P-chan home once she is drunk'.

BUT ahaha. I did not dance on poles. In fact, I am frickin' good at drinking. I WAS drunk, yes, make no mistake. And I did puke, yes, make no mistake.

BUT I WAS IN CONTROL. Muahahahaha.

So now I sit before my laptop, feeling kinda heady and giddy and sleepy. As I sms-ed my colleague, I am no worse for wear - the hangover is not so much a hangover as it is a kind of loopy feeling. Which is kind of unpleasant but not unbearable.

BUT by God's good name. NEVER AGAIN. I solemnly vow to not touch beer for AT LEAST A MONTH. Serious. I've had enough alcohol to last me for at least ten years.

So here is what happened. (Pictures are terrible, but it was very dark.)

If you have one of these A-Frame studio easels you are also probably familiar with the tendency for the easel tray/support to wobble when you are painting. For years I tried all kinds of fixes, putting in way too much thought and creativity into something that continued to frustrate me. And then came an idea so easy a caveman could have thought of it: I used wood shims. Now it's easy to adjust my height and get a stable work support each time. Duh... For years I had been working on a 12 x 16 glass palette. It fit nicely in my work area and I had an old cookie sheet that I inverted over the wet paint to retard drying. Then I discovered a large piece of glass packed in with some old sketches and decided - why not? It's 18 x 28 (probably came from an old watercolor). I cut a piece of medium gray mat board to size and taped the glass and mat together with painter's tape. I could not believe the difference this made. I was so afraid it was too large and I would hate it - but quite the opposite.
A few weeks ago Bonnie, the more exciteable of the two puppies, charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose. It bloody hurt. Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose. However, me being me, I thought, "it can't possibly be Bonnie's fault" and so I decided I had sinusitis! Stop laughing at the back.  Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had. Except today I couldn't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor. So off I trudged, to his little TARDIS in the next village, and let him have a right good look up my hooter. Prodding and pressing, feeling and caressing, asking me about snot and things on my hankie, he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine. "Have you knocked it recently?" he asked. "Oh, well one of my puppies did a bit since," I answered.  Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis. "You've broken your nose," he said. He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense.
Sleep - I've missed you
The past few weeks have been a little crazy with our little guy. For some reason he all of a sudden decided to loathe going to bed. He used to be so easy to put down. Give him his pacifier - he starts playing with his hair - and zonk. He's out.

Well he started refusing his pacifier, which I at first thought was great because I didn't want him to have it forever anyway. But then a few days later he started with this bed-hating thing and that has been going on for quite some time now. We decided it was time to just let him cry it out. We've never really had to decide whether or not to let him cry it out because nap time and bed time had never been an issue before, but things changed and we knew he needed to learn to go to sleep and stay asleep by himself.

So...long story short, I've heard a LOT of crying in the past couple weeks but we're finally about there. The past 3-4 nights he's gone to bed at night with less than a minute or two of crying and he's stayed asleep until about 5 am, at which point I feed him and he goes back to bed until about 7 - 7:30. I don't think he's quite ready for all night yet, but we are making progress! We're still figuring out nap time, but we seem to be getting back on track there too - much less crying, much more sleeping.

It's just crazy how all of sudden he can change like that. Of course it always happens right as things are going well and stabilizing. I even took him to the doctor last week. We just didn't seem to be making any progress and I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him (I would've felt really bad about making him cry it out if he had an ear infection or something). But, nothing was wrong. I think it was just a combination of teething, growing, wanting our constant attention, and going through some new developments - crawling, standing, etc.

So anyway, this week has been much happier. He wakes up happy now and is much happier during the day too. Babies really do need their sleep and they get pretty miserable when the don't get it. (By the way - he hasn't ever had his pacifier again, so I guess that's good. Some days I miss it, especially at nap time, but I'm glad it's gone).

On another note, we've been enjoying some amazing weather! Eli and I have spent a lot of time outside and it has been wonderful. We go on walks, go to the playground nearby and watch the bigger kids play, sit on the lawn, and eat grass and dirt - oh wait, that's just Eli. 

Anyway, he's a cutie. I bought him a new toy last week at Kid to Kid (have you ever been there? It's second hand stuff, but it's in great condition). Most of his toys are hand-me-downs (I think I've only ever bought him one other toy; poor kid) and he was getting pretty sick of them , so we picked up this cool "new" toy last week (along with a really cute pair of shoes). He really likes it and it holds his attention for more than 10 seconds. Woohoo!So that's probably why my blogging has suffered a bit lately. We've all been tired and cranky, but we're coming out of the fog now. Hooray! It sure feels good to sleep. It's been a long time since I've slept all night, so even though he's not making it all the way until 7, he's doing a lot better than he was, and I sure feel a difference. So that's what's new!

We have some exciting things coming up. Jeremy's brother is coming in town this weekend and he and his fiancee are coming for dinner on Saturday. Then my mom comes into town on Monday and my sister Amy and her 4 kids come into town on Wednesday! It'll be an adventure! We're excited.

Oh, and Happy St. Patrick's Day (whatever - not a holiday I get excited about) and sorry this is the longest post ever...

Thank you!
Thank you everyone for your comments/suggestions on car seats and food. It was very much appreciated and Eli is enjoying many new foods lately and is eating a TON (growth spurt? yes). We still need to find a car seat (we haven't really gone shopping yet) but I've been looking online at ones you have suggested, so thanks! I plan on blogging more and putting up pictures later today or tomorrow, but for now, that's all! Thanks again.
When did I eat algae?

I swear to you, about all I have accomplished lately with any regularity is being sick. Straight up, pukey, green, gross, sick to my stomach. I feel like I ate algae - even though I'm not entirely sure it would make me feel this sick to eat algae, It's an educated guess.


I'm supposed to go to Arizona this week for another Midlife Road Trip adventure. Because of this general state of putrid pukiness, I'm starting to be concerned. What if I am inclined to want to puke off the side of the hot air balloon or throw up when I am  rock climbing or shooting a big ass gun in the desert? I don't care how good the editor is, you can't make vomiting look good.

That's why in the 50's Colonel Tom would yell, "Chew it back, Elvis," and then he would.


I found out today I am not flying this trip but instead am driving all the mother trucking way there with two of the Midlife Road Trip crew - JD (Executive Producer~ left) & the one known only in this country as The Dude (camera god ~ right). Why I'm driving and not in an airplane this time is a long story that's not interesting in the least. All you need to know is that it's entirely OK to feel sorry for me.





In fact, I wish you would start right this minute.
I'm an excellent car-tripper. Love it. That's not really the issue. What is getting all up in my business is that me and my algae stomach are going to be trapped on four wheels with two men who will probably spend the whole trip talking about three things that will make me want to spew even more:
Sports (football, baseball, basketball & synchronized pudding wrestling.)
Women (tall ones, short ones, young ones, young ones, young ones, young ones.)
Gross things they have at one time or another thrown up after drinking too much. (Roasted lamb intestines, Doritos they found in their foot locker from college, and for reasons I'm sure I never want to know, an entire package of pink erasers.)
Dammit. I just made myself feel even worse. I think I am about to burp a green bubble.
Drunk Girls 

Yesterday the fine people at Red Stripe sent me a case of their finest imported Jamaican beer. So I brought it home, called my friend Andy, and invited him over to enjoy the lager before heading out to meet up with Brian for some Kareoke at Lolita Tavern. 

Andy came over with his med school friend Jared. We sat around drinking, smoking, and talking about the Olsen Twins. Jared's family is born-again Christian and I learned that he kept Kosher and celebrates Passover. Like me, he thinks that Hannukah isn't as important of a holiday as the media would like us to think. Whatever, the festival of lights was important, but in the grand scheme of things, the holiday gets more attention than it should because it falls in the same month of Christmas. I think that in my 23 years of living, I got about 3 gifts on Hannukah, and it was all coincedental because my mom just likes to shop. Last weekend she bought me a new comforter and Ralph Lauren sheets... but only because she loves to shop, not because she was posing as Hannukah Harry. 

Anyway... on to the important stuff: 
After the three of us had a few drinks we headed over to Lolita Tavern to meet up with Brian and participate in some Sid and Buddy Kareoke. [By the way, i think S&B will be hosting the Aquarius Birthday Kareoke Bash that i'm having with Laura and Dan -- everyone is invited, of course]. Good times as usual. Jared joined me on stage to sing "Ziggy Stardust" ... I tried to serenade a drunk girl who was passed out, but even my off-key singing didnt wake her. So everyone posed with her. 

Eventually I woke her up (which took a lot of shaking, prodding, etc), helped her up, and told her that she had to go. Andy brought her some water, she drank it and ran out. We tried to find her to put her in a taxi, but she literally disappeared into the night. Vanished.

Dear The Flu 

Dear The Flu, 
Thanks for coming just in time for the holiday party season. I know that you and God had to do it to prevent me from drinking too much and dying from alcohol posioning at the holiday party. That's cool. I can live with that. Instead I sat in bed thinking that all i needed were drops of zinc to cure me until I woke up on friday afternoon and texted Lizzy to come into my room to see if I had a fever since I couldn't move. Determining that I was burning up, she brought me some NyQuil and Orange Juice. Then Damon came over to give me Theraflu. At about 2am, Marc jumped into my bed and found me heating up and sweaty. The next morning I woke up healthy! See ya next year! 

Love, Sarah.
MEN"O"PAUSE - Just don't freak out its just not another biology lecture. Not even the agony aunt section nether i am trying to tell you the psychological and vital stats of middle aged women... ( I know the title will force you to think so)
" Aurat ko pav ki jhooti samajhna chod do"(Its a dialog from some yesteryear movie)
Yes indeed I am talking about our very much prevalent "PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY" male dominance, power and superiority complex. It all started to monitor families more over it was about the family tree that followed which is why the oldest male member had the power to take major decisions to make life simple and methodical. Rules were different for different families. Its basic objective was to follow a routine and have discipline in life.
But as lifestyle got more pacey homo sapiens, typical to there behavior are champions in escaping things. Like the rituals nowadays have become more simplistic even more are celebrated twice in just one year! Moreover this modifying trend and escapist behaviors is now seen everywhere even in are daily mundane chores. This is what we women have been the victim of ...
First place a woman is a symbol of power, force,love and affection. We worship her in many forms like 'Durga', 'Kali' , even when we want wealth and prosperity its Goddess 'Laxmi' whose worshiped before Lord 'Kuber comes in the picture. Then why do have such hypocritical society with double standards, where at one place we give her status of the Almighty and also keep the odacity to harass, abuse and molest her.
I might not be the one give the absolute decision, neither have I researched enough but I chose to speak my mind with perception and knowledge of my own. Patriarchal Society was just pictured and coined not to objectify women or manhandle them. It was just to protect them and allow them to do chores suited for them not because they are weak, but its a proven fact that physically they are not meant to do certain things. As men they are totally misinterpreted it and we have purda-system, female fetuscide and infanticide.
Many conventional writers will freak out at the boldness of my statement but I think its time to say it and face it. other than eve's teasing, lecherous gaze,just being felt in public are the most humiliating experiences experienced by almost every women. But whats most humiliating is when that same women whose your mother, wife and sister is completely shunned for five days of the month.( Its just a situation I am mentioning have been among the luckiest one by not facing it) Now my logic to it is that those five days are for her to rest even the body purges itself. Its like giving her a small vacation from her daily chores. But again the theory of misinterpretation comes in, we absolutely shun her to be in complete isolation not even allowed to worship, why would God have a problem with it when he himself created it. :)
One more dominant characteristic of this kind of society is they die for a son to carry on the lineage and the heir to the property. The most hilarious concept I have ever understood. What will the son do with the million and zillion of sperms when he will not the a women to bore it. After God its the immortal women are the ones who gives life and birth and ironically still seen as the fairer sex or the suppressed one.
So men 'o' pause and together with the support of both the genders we can practice equality and not just talk equality.
I LOVE to read and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE books. So much so that my entire career has been about selling books!

I started off selling Bibles at the Bible Society Bookshop that used to be on Bathurst St in the city. Let's just say that working in the city wasn't dull, even in a bible shop!, then went from there to managing a particular chains bookstores(I decline to name the chain on this blog), an interesting experience in itself, and what lead to my burn-out at only age 25 in the retail industry! Never again, unless I OWN the shop.

Which leads me to my current position as Special Sales Manager for a book importer and distributor. Special Sales basically covers any stores that want to sell books to compliment their existing range of goods. I sell to everyone, from military enthusiasts, to auto nuts, crafters, woodworkers, hobbyists, miniature dolls house makers, sex shops, dvd shops, dog schools, antique stores, equestrian shops...you name em, we sell to em. It's a pretty interesting job and pretty full-on at the moment since the former Special Sales Manager left to have her baby and decided not to come back. Still waiting for someone to replace me...until then I do it all!
A Commercial Break: Whole Foods and Australia
March 04, 2010
I received a press release yesterday from Whole Foods about a promotion they're doing with Australia.

+

'In just the past few years, Australia has earned a solid reputation for producing some of the finest varietals in the world. Whole Foods Market will be taking shoppers on a wine 'walkabout' starting today and running through May 5th, highlighting the value and quality of Australian wines with selections from Australia's diverse wine-growing regions.

From an organically grown Chardonnay and a spritzy, bright, aromatic Verdelho-Viognier blend to a dark chocolate cherry Pinot Noir and the continent's best Cabernet Sauvignon, we will have styles for everyone.'

+

Like many others in the wine world, I've been puzzled by Whole Food's lack of commitment to the natural wine world, as if what goes into wine is not as important as what goes into food. Okay, it's not. Food is nourishment of another kind, but if WF is going to get into the wine biz, shouldn't they have some principles?

So, I wrote a letter. It was strong, hard-nosed, I didn't sugar coat. Perhaps I should have but the gist was basically==shouldn't Whole Foods step up to the plate?

I'll share the response I received.

Alice,

Thank you for the interest and input. We are confident that the products we support meet our quality standards and our support of family wine making traditions in Australia. Additionally, we feel great about promoting a wine trade devastated by fires a year ago.

Ashley


Duly noted. And duly noted that there was nothing about the fires in her press release.

The fires of February 2009 were awful. There were too many deaths. Per reportage in the Wine Spectator in May, 2009, over 200. Yarra Yarra was destroyed. Roundstone was destroyed and about 5 % if the Yarra Valley vineyards were affected. But it is anticipated that the vineyards will come back over the next couple of years.

++

I trust Ashley did some quick spin on this, as there was nothing about fires in the release. Never the less, am happy for WF's charitable attitude, but why not showcase some of the rare organic wines from the area? Or also sponsor a natural wine week? Or learn the differences in certification?

I didn't mean for this to turn into an editorial, but I'm staring out my window with Detroit in the distance, hoping there are no bed bugs in that bed behind me, and it just came on.
H1N1-Popularly known as Swine  Its weird the kind of 'Publicity' these pigs r getting these days (No Offense..Swine being piggy)..no but seriously...this disease..it has a technical name (school ka naam) H1N1 2009 and also a pet name (Ghar ka naam...bole to pyar wala) Swine Flu :-D that is funny :):) Heeheehee..my PJ sense is improving..am I proud of that or what ;-)

No but on a serious note, I wasnt too sure that the situation actually is so grave..not until I learnt that a kid from my school (Can't get over the fact that I have left it ages back now, still have the connections there!!) has caught on the virus..this is real, as are the 'precautionary advices' coming from all sources..esp from home...let me pass on a few...esp when people are so closely following the whole thing..with the PMO officially saying that they would follow the Swine Flu cases on a daily basis!

* Stay away from crowded places: Please shut the offices for sometime and give everyone paid holidays! 

*Stay away from firangs/Desi Firangs: Firangs categorising the originals and desi Firangs the 'I am an Indian with an American Passport'

*Use Tissues and NOT cotton 'Hanky':Am sure all the 'Ba's and Parvati's' are in for a shock!

A few more.. But I guess, I just love this 1:

*Cover your nose/mouth, as you sneeze/cough: Get your basic etiquettes right boss and there will be no more swine :D

Long live pigs...and Humans...in a 'virus free' world :)

P.S: Jokes apart, it is a grave situations and we must all take the precautions..

Just take care!
The END?? but how? -  When i first gave a thought for my second post... my ideas mapped to a world of possibilities continuing ad infinitum. So right they say "A finite world with infinite possibilities"....The world has become so finite that its very end is being speculated by infinite possibilities.

By now u must have rightly guessed(..aha that was easy!) what im talking about... ya ... the "End of the world" or the "Doomsday" or the "Apocalypse" or watever zillion names it has... the most intriguing, controversial, happening topic in recent times. I initially became aware of such thing some 3 yrs ago through a friend. Back then, it was hardly 1 or 2 possibilities i knew of... the main one being the collision of earth with some Planet X(also called the Nibiru). As time passed by, some websites and the media realised the immense potential of this topic with the amount of curiousity it generated in people and started fuelling their content with fabricated rumours, misinterpreted facts and incomplete analysis of events. The result? An amazing increase in the number of hits - a chance for these people to cash in. The effect? The already insecure people to buy in all the stuff and become more insecure.

My knowledge till few days back was limited to little awareness of certain prophecies and celestial events that i gained through mail fwds ,occasional browsing and discussion with friends(especially during exam time ;)) about the topic. With that incomplete knowledge, it was easy for certain people to almost come to a conclusion that 'the world is coming to an end'("A little knowledge is a dangerous thing" applies right here) though not me, i was trying to be optimistic( arey sirf 20% life ko jiyi ab thak...poori 80% baki padi hain! :P ;) ). Then, i started kind of getting deep into this stuff( atleast to write something substantial in my blog :P) . From one wiki article to another, from that wesbite to this website, from this video to that video... my god! the amount of space they occupy in the internet area is truly mind boggling and so is the content!

A liitle research into the topic n u can know that the date, the doomsday 'Dec 21, 2012' was very cleverly chosen. It almost coincides with the end of 'Mayan Calender'. But is it really an end? The Maya, a pre-Columbian civilization well known for their religious and spiritual culture, was also noted for its developed art ,architecture, mathematical and astronomical systems. Their concept of time was different from us. They developed 3 calenders and the last one called the 'Long Count Calender' is used to calculate longer periods of time. The Mayans are particularly fascinated by cycles and this calender worked around various cycles of time from lower order to higher order. The doomsday is simply the end of 13th b'ak'tun, a higher order cycle.There was no much evidence that it points to the end of the world. "The higher b'ak'tuns are yet to come" say some notable Mayan researchers. .Now y did they chose to end the cycle on that day?  Well as i told Mayans are religious and spiritual people. They celebrated certain celestial events with end of cycles... for them it was a change influenced by one cycle on another... the beginning of a new era. So,wat important celestial event is to take place at that tym...?

Well folks, even im beginnin to realise the immense potential of this topic! ;) ... looks like its gonna go for pages(n may be a book :P) . Im gonna take a break( n u 2 ...huh wat a relief! :P) for now... n continue it in my next post... till then have fun! live more! n get more curious! :P
The Spice Rack


Some people collect spices as souvenirs of their travels, with exotic specimens indexed and stored in pristine condition like inventories from archeological digs. Others deck out their kitchens like pharmacological laboratories, with powders, plants, and roots displayed in glass jars.  Some tuck theirs into a special box and dig through when they need them. Some people like mixes and rubs, and fix up a big batch every now and then. Many fabulous cooks I know keep a special coffee grinder reserved for spices. Every cook's spice collection reflects their favorite kind of cooking. Food enthusiasts can compile enormous collections that can go stale if they're not careful. How's your spice rack doing, by the way?

Spices don't last forever. They should be purchased in reasonable amounts and replenished often. In taking my kitchen cure, I am replacing old with fresh.  Since we're not millionaires, I have to approach this with reason and a dose of parsimony. But that does not stop me from feeling great about the possibilities for my spice rack at the moment.

The first task is to take out my kitchen notebook and list the spices in my favorite recipes. Repeat appearances will make the list, and if I am planning a dish anytime in the future, I'll mark whatever I need as well.

Second, browse through the cookbooks for the international cooking I love most. I think the best thing, in building my spice rack up again, will be the opportunity to make a list of new recipes to try and take on some that I realistically would like to add to my cooking repertoire.

Third, rely on my friends. My friend Francine, for instance, comes from the West Indies and has a stash of freshly dried mace, collected from the nutmeg tree of her aunt, and cinnamon local to her home. I will give her a call and hit her up for some of that!

There are also some spices that I have to wait to collect. For example, the anise seed. There is a producer down at the Wednesday night market that harvests wild anise and during a certain window of the year, you can get branches of it laden with the seed. I bought some last year and it was heavenly. The taste was so much better than what you could buy in a shop. So I am going to wait for that.

Some spices just have to come from far away places, but many herbs can be grown. I am not very big on store bought dried herbs, and don't keep them much because I don't think the ones that have been ground to a powder, stored, shipped and traded by the metric ton taste as good as the ones you can get fresh from the market or garden and dry or freeze yourself.

Which brings me to another project altogether: An herb drying rack - one made specifically for that, which can put an end to my having to fight my way through a tangle of twigs and brambles to get to a spoon to stir my soup with.
A recent experience my friends and I had while traveling in a popular weekend train made me realize… the sorry state of affairs that our country operates in. It just somehow runs. My friend lost her purse containing a bit of cash and a lot of cards – atm cards, corporate travel cards, credit cards during our train journey – it accidentally fell out of the train- and my two friends and I decided to place a complaint in the Police Station just so that we have a complaint number to block any of the cards, we weren’t anyway expecting them to find her purse – that would be too much of an ask. Three girls enter the police station at the wee hours of the morning: there’s a lady cop sitting in one of the rooms and two constables – it’s a dungeon like damp smelling dimly lit place. This is what transpired there.
Master-piece  I stare at the canvas in front of me. This large painting sheet in front of me. All filled with colors. Some bright, some dull, some stark and loud, some mellow and somber. Colors carefully put in by me, and some splashed recklessly.   I am breathing hard, at wits end, on a mindless mission to color some more. The parts I like, I touch them not. While feverishly trying to add some sense to the spaces that make me not so happy anymore.

And as much as I try, the colors just run, and mix up with others to make all look as one. I gasp for breath and cry for a pause, and then I see the top right corner on the canvas wall.

There in the corner was a whiteness I had never seen. Where did that come from, that glossy sheen? Staring at it, such beauty I saw. All innocently and in awe.

Oh! it actually was left all alone. Untouched by colors, untouched by me, this little section was the "Master"-piece.
What do you say to them when you realise that whatever you do say might not be understood.  Or will be, more times than not, a waste of time, and will make you feel worse than you probably do already.  Those beautiful malteser eyes stare up at me with huge great tears just bursting with volcanic resemblence, and I am supposed to decide in a split second whether this is an age issue, or one of autistic trait. Last week I lost the plot.  I guess sometimes even mums are allowed to have a tantrum, and that was what I did. The door took most of it, but I must have looked like a mad woman; completely crazed by a child's rudeness.  I couldn't cry.  Tears wouldn't come to the surface even though I was sobbing inside.  I knew having a tantrum in front of my autistic daughter was the worst thing I could have done, and I'm still reliving it seven days later, when she tells me how crazy I was.  But then the inevitable happened; word from elsewhere that Amy had been telling her friends about our little tete-a-tete.
Is it all really for everyone else?
Sometimes at University, we discuss about modern society. It's a Journalism course, so we tend to have classes about Sociology, Midia and Antropology as well.

And often, there is a moment where I am let to think that everything we do, all the stuff we buy and the way we want our bodies to look is not for us, it is not something only for our good. It is for everyone else.


Our personality, what we own and how we look only really means something when the other person notices those things. We live in a society; it's where we interact, share moments, live. And how we are seen by everyone else matters. It really does.

We want to feel part of the whole group. The last thing we want is to feel left out. So we behave, buy and aim the same goals in life. We all want a job that will make us all earn good money, we all want to look good.

We all want to be accepted.

Is that a good thing? Those who go the opposite way tend to be belong to the groups most people wouldn't want to be part of: the poor, the fat, the insane.

Is it really like that? I would like to think we are better than that. We want to belong and feel welcome, that is true. But do we really need to consume and feel like the way we look always need improvement?

Sometimes, wouldn't you just like to not care?
A Letter to Life! Dear Life,

I know you will always do well unless a more treacherous thing than you ditches you. Keep up the game you play every day. The video game of my life is very exciting with each door leading to more pitfalls and just one real door(that is hidden) ;)

Wow, you are awesome! you have a different and new game set everyday for each breathing creature alive! I wonder as to how do you do this. Ambidextrous are you and reminds me of Goddess Durga. Are you really her?

Would like to know more about your multitasking programs and algorithms written since time unknown. Do let me know. Will keep the secret well hidden! Kudos :)

Last but not the least, the list of your fan following is huge. The fans are sort of freaked out in the video games you designed for them so they could not convey their love for you. Some of them are lost in transition through the Bermuda Triangles created in their games by you.

With much enthusiam to see much more,
Love
Nupur (a lover of the video game of my life)
The minute somebody says "desi", what's the first thing that comes to mind? It used to be Indians for me. And I thought it was the same for everybody. Until I met somebody from Pakistan, who had moved here to the US and lived here for quite a few years. She said, "Its so nice to meet desi people!". The association for "desi" people here includes Nepalis and Pakistanis (yet to spot any Sri Lankans)...  And it hit me...  Differences in nationality, religion etc seem so petty when a group stand united to try and help each other settle into a new country. Suddenly, everything going on in the LOC seems like such a waste of precious resources. You learn to look beyond the military battles, beyond the politics, beyond the violence, and get to look into the eyes of a person, who wants peace as badly as you do, and is tired of being told to hate you, just like how you don't want to hate them...  At the end of the day, I just don't have words to describe the bond that keeps us desis here together...  But I sure am glad that love triumphs over hate.
The Rest of the Story: AAPS Budget, Part II
I think I addressed the largest chunk of the budget with my recent post on personnel costs and my post on revenue enhancements, including a look at whether we can increase Medicaid reimbursement. Here are a few other thoughts.

1. Efficiencies--Some of the reductions--for instance, finding efficiencies in ESL teaching and other "split" positions--seem like they should have been done long ago, if they are feasible. (Which makes me a little suspicious. Are they?)

2. Transportation--I've written about my opposition to privatization. There is no reason at all to balance the budget on the backs of the lowest-paid staff in the district. But there were three other transportation issues raised in the budget forums:
We should not eliminate Kindergarten midday bussing. That sure would make it hard for working parents to send their kids to district schools, unless they replaced it with full-day kindergarten (which I think probably costs more than the savings). When my oldest started kindergarten, I was considering a private school with a full-day kindergarten, and if I had started him there, and if I was satisfied. . . I doubt the public schools would have seen me for several years.  [At the forum, I was asked by my group's facilitator, "Well where did your kids go then, at midday, if you were working?" Answer: to their preschool, where my second child was enrolled all day.]
We should be working with AATA. For my high school-aged kids, the walk to the AATA bus route is not any further for us than the walk to the AAPS bus stop, and it doesn't take any longer to get to school. I think many routes could be eliminated for high school students, if we can make it easy. UM students just show their student IDs. Can't high school students do the same thing? Then we would only need to bus those kids who are not reached by AATA.
I question expanding the walk zone to two miles. It may come to this, but I'm not a big fan of my daughter walking two miles in the dark in a Michigan winter. I don't want my kids to have to drive to school. I don't want to encourage the culture of driving everywhere, and in any case, cars are expensive.
3. Reducing high school noon hour staff. This seems impractical, if Pioneer and Huron are closing their campuses at lunch time, even to upper class students.  

4. Reducing substitute expenses--can we do more? I understand this refers to changing the scheduling of professional meetings that take teachers out of classes, and that might be fine. In addition, though, I recently read a study that assessed teacher absenteeism. I have no idea if it is high or low in Ann Arbor, but probably that should be assessed--and if it is high, maybe there is a way to make it lower. I have also wondered if it would be less expensive to assign a building substitute in each elementary school building (and more in the middle/high schools). 

5. Reducing administrators--can we do more? It is convenient for the district that Maggie Jewett and Michael White are both leaving high school principal positions, and it makes it easy to propose reducing one class principal at Huron and Pioneer. For mid-year reductions, it makes sense to stop there. But for next year, I believe that we could get by with 1 principal and 2 assistant principals at each high school. Before Skyline was established, there were 5 at each high school (or 10 total). Rather than saying that we now need 4 at each high school (for a total of 12), why not say that we can get by with 9? I'll bet that it can even be done by attrition. And is it possible that some of the higher-level departments can be consolidated, thus allowing us to eliminate some management positions?

6. The high school cops. Susan Baskett raised this issue as a question at the budget forum I attended. Do we need them? I will add my confusion about them: What are they there for? What do they do? Can we do it for less? I don't know the entire costs, but I do often see an empty police car, just sitting there, even late at night, at Skyline, and it seems like a waste to me.
Every time I lose a phone (this happens a lot to me), I go through this immense confusion when deciding on the next one.  These are my usual choices. The good old Nokia basic models – These are highly functional, dexterous, full of no-nonsense and your trusted friend. Mainly because they are resilient to all kinds of mishandling and continue to serve you faithfully.  They still have your favorite snake games, and let you type SMSes at lightning speed. Of course, they can mean three things about you: either you are super-bogged by too many features and want to keep it simple, or you do not want to move on to newer technology no-matter-what, or just that you can’t afford a high-end phone. Be wary of these judgments and make sure you know your slot.  :) The latest on the menu – iPhones, Nexus Ones, HTCs and Blackberries of the world. Hmmm. I am not a fan of these phones. Mainly because the features are so many and so distracting that you don’t feel like doing simple things -  like checking your email on your laptop and replying at your own snail-ish and convenient pace, after  giving a thought about how and what to write. I remember, in my primary school, we were taught by our IT teacher that the main advantage of an email is: “An email service doesn’t have the dangling urgency of a telephone call”. So why change the way nature (err… ) used to work, and get hooked to replying to emails at lightning speed? Why obliviate all those expensive MP3 players, IPods, Cameras and Laptops that you invested in? Use them too fellas! Don’t give it all to your mobile communicating device.
Something amazing happened yesterday.  I knew at the beginning of the week that I was nearing the end of my novel, the one I have been writing on and off for the past two years.  The one in which I have fictionalised my own paranormal experiences, seeing them through Camilla's eyes.  I have lived her life, thought her thoughts, created her from my own imagination.  I have felt as if I owned her, as if she answered only to me.  I have visualised actors playing the parts of characters, Martin Shaw as the Reverand Oakley, Robson Green as Michael all verging on a complete fantasy of which I have seen played out before my eyes. But yesterday I realised that I had reached the light which marked the end of my work in progress.  I had said everything that needed to be said, got to the point where stretching out the novel for the sake of length would have been wrong and most likely spoilt the whole effect.  And so I closed the file and finished it.  I haven't typed the words, "The End" because I am sure there will be much to add, and too much to subtract.  I have put my little memory sticks on which the book is saved, into a drawer and locked it.

Feels like a monthly blog!

It dawns on me that it was just about a month ago that I updated this thing! Being in a musical melodrama in addition to work just about did me in! So, the thoughts for today:

To have someone change their behavior, the person must THINK differently. This was an idea I heard of about 8 years ago when I listened to Dennis Sparks (National Staff Development Council) speak to the MAS/FPS board during one of our summer retreats. I never forgot his ideas. One of our assignments was to read an online book: "Designing Effective Professional Development," and the ideas hit home then, and they hit home now.

So why haven't things changed?

I guess I've changed. I've changed jobs (school districts) twice since then, and each time I entered into these new cultures, I first had to assimilate myself into this new ground, before I could start to embark on any change. That is the hardest thing for me right now. Being in my new district merely 6 months, but having ideas that could potentially be employed in an instant, yet knowing that IMPOSING those ideas will not create real change is frustrating. 

People need to THINK differently. The training that I'm attending during these first two school days in Februrary and two days in March involves increasing skills in "Coaching for Results." The idea is to use conversations to stimulate thinking, and to effect change. This kind of thinking is a type that elicits emotion, and allows connections to be made. From this intense emotional change comes change. 
And it ain't easy, and it isn't timely. But it lasts...and therefore it is important.
Rather than wonder if there had been something lacking or unclear in the discernment process, I bore that sense of unfitness like a shameful wound, blaming myself for being inadequate in one way or another (too introverted, too insecure, too self-centered--you get the idea), all because I believed I was under the holiest of obligations to fulfill the commitment I had made to God, the Church, and a couple hundred assorted parishioners, and everyone else I chose to lump into the picture.

What never seemed to enter the conversation and never occurred to me to ask was what kind of holy obligation I owed to myself. 

And for most of those years I found it hard to affirm, not for others but for myself, that the holiest obligation each of us has (whether understood as being an obligation to God or to the world or simply to ourselves) is to be as fully and wholly and unabashedly ourselves as possible. To express fully and robustly the unique and unrepeatable version of life that we are and that we have been given to embody and to carry forth.
The most irritating yet adorable characteristic of Billiken is the way he keeps us up all night with his antics. This incident happened a few weeks back . To complete my usual day , i went to bed and dozed off. I suddenly felt the presence of a living object near me . I felt it . No it wasnt a pillow. I opened my eyes and guess who! Mr. Naughty (Billiken) . I was damn sleepy , i just ignored him and kicked him out of my bed. The next morning i wasnt even sure if Billiken's coming to my room was real or just my crazy dream. I mentioned this to my mom and she was positive that it was my dream , cause "billiken will never walk into our rooms at night". He repeated himself the following night too , but this time i was wide awake. I shoved him away a couple of times , to be exact 6! But he was relentless. Oh! Dash it ! it was already one thirty at night! But he wasnt planning to give up. Later that night , when my dad walked in to check on us , he found Billiken sleeping between my sister and me. Things like this are pardonable once in a while , but not everyday.

Missin' Music

My piano is in a warehouse, but two guitars are leaned up against the wall of my living room. I listen to music, but I haven't played in so long. The strings on my guitars glare at me, and dare me to tune them. 

I stopped in the music store across from my office, and walked through.
"Feel free to try anything you like out..." the guy running the place said. So I wandered about, and tried a Fender or or two. Wandered out again, and drove home. Looked at my guitars, and tuned one and strummed a bit. 

Later this evening, I stopped at the Blues Benefit for the Delta County Humane Society. And wow...I sat through some good tunes. I was only there for about an hour and a half, but my toes tapped the whole time. I wish I knew someone who'd come with me...but I don't know anyone here yet that likes that sort of thing, so I went solo. 
Course, when there's live music, I'm rarely lonely!

November 2009

I rode my bike on November 1 in Escanaba, MI! The wind ripped into every nearly-open article of clothing I wore...and I wore MANY layers. However, it was sunny, not snowing, and I was a bit stir crazy. So off I went!

To be honest, it was the first bike ride I'd taken since moving here a little over a month ago. Biking is a great way to really make sense of neighborhoods, and so as each weekend approached, I thought I'd get the chance to go...but then it would rain, or I'd have to run somewhere. So on Sunday afternoon, I had my big chance. I had great aspirations, and took off toward the lake, but the wind intensified. I coasted as long as I could, and was thankful when it was time to turn around. However, I did it, and it was a pretty good ride. 

My bike is parked along the side of the wall in the garage...next to the snow shovel. However this weekend is supposed to be warmer than normal, so it might get more road time in a couple of days. Yea!

Tamanna sped into the night. She would never have figured out the way to her house, had it not been for years of experience on those roads. Her mind was in an unsettling chaos. Scenes kept flipping in flashes across her mind; most of them carried Ryan as their subject. She felt unrest of the kind, which people felt only when they realised that their worst dreams were coming true. She turned a few corners and finally jammed into the driveway of her private residence. Within moments, she had found her way into her bedroom. She locked herself in and dropped on her bed. The scenes still played and replayed in her head. The touch of his hands on hers lingered. Her deepest desires that she had kept locked away, had been stirred. She could not bear herself to think that all that had taken him was a glance and a simple handshake to break the imaginary wall she had taken seven years to build around herself. She resented herself more than she had ever done before.
No one person had ever occupied Ryan’s thoughts completely since his mother’s death fifteen years back, at least not until tonight. He had always been used to being waited upon- the servants who cooked and served his food, the security who held the door open for him, the employees at his office, why, even successful entrepreneurs and big businessmen used to wait upon him. But today, a mere girl, in the infancy of her business career had made him wait upon her even as she drove past with formal courtesies, each of which had resonated with insult. She had attracted his attention in the crowd; all this had only made him want her even more. Want her, not so that he could impose his will on her, want her so that she would bend her will to attune to his. At any point, he would not command her to do anything, but he would reduce her to a position where she would succumb to his wishes without the need of him even expressing those.
But the moment he had thought of winning over her, he knew he had fallen into a trap. She had taken complete control of his thoughts and, he realised, very soon his actions too.
Inspite of this, he felt alive after a long time. A drive to achieve what he wanted had aroused the force within him. It gave a new sense of life, renewed in its vigour, virile in the challenge it posed.
For an instant, he closed his eyes; his face suddenly became solemn and he uttered one single word from his lips “Sorry.” And then he drowned himself in thoughts of her, again.
Saga of the Golconda Fort!! "Everything that goes up comes down" said someone. The famous saying resonates in my mind each time I visit a fort. There are 2 reasons for it.
1) The glory of the once glamorous fort becomes the memories of the bygone days where as the fort is a new example of gloom in the present.
2)We climb a fort (panting) and come down (refreshed).

The above thoughts revisited me today when I was at Golconda. It is a famous fort in Hyderabad. I visited it with a friend who is a history maniac :) so effortlessly I got to know about the Golconda without a real guide. He told me that he has been to Golconda 6 times before. In one of those times the guides to the fort thought he is a new guide and questioned him......Sometimes knowledge can land you in unforeseen circumstances.

It was too hot in Hyderabad today as May is one of the hottest months here. The temperature and the staircase to the fort almost took my breathe. I was panting and my face all red. The brain demanding for more oxygen......Why I chose May to be here and why not some other cooler months...Huh! My dream to save myself was close now as I reached the top of the fort and there was a cold drink shop I can see vaguely. My friend Saptarshi climbed without much effort; would have become a habit.....how can I forget he has been here 6 times already.

I sat down and requested him to get cold drink.....Drank...What a relief...Phew! :) After that we saw the whole Hyderabad from above the fort. It was beautiful. After all pain it was worth it. Captured the view in my eyes as we did not take Camera and we came down the fort........and hey I was running down the fort......"I hope you do not want your medical reimbursement tomorrow" he chuckled.

There was a light and sound show in the eve which depicts the complete history of the Golconda fort in the voice of the Big B. We thought to go there before time so that we can get the front seats. Alas! we are late but not too late we got seats in the second row along with a Cat sitting beside me on a chair. I was fumbled when I saw that the cat`s fur, cat`s eyes and the chair colour matched. It was light brown.

We two were waiting for the show to begin. Ahead of us was a gang of 5 people from a company and they were waiting for 3 girls who would join them. We never talked to them but since they talked loudly.......so I have ears people. The 3 beauties stepped in and one of them OMG I know her...............or may be I dont.....may be we both do not....or may be just me...."Thanks to orkut" I smirked and thought. She is the girlfriend of my school senior and I saw her in his photo album.
After a long time thinking should I or should I not ask her I decided to ask her....I enquired "Hi ! Do you know ______? ". I felt her heart pounded and she asked who are you. I was his junior in school and blah blah explanation. I found her good. Good choice senior :)

The show began finally.......It was awesome with voice of Amitabh Bachchan as a guide explaning to visitors. In between we had ghazals and bhajans sung by Jagjeet Singh and Kavita Krishnamoorthy(only the audio). The Golconda Fort came back to life with the lights specifying the stories narrated in the background. I could actually imagine the king , the queens, the soldiers, the plots, the plays. I got an Idea these people should include real actors as well to give more realistic images. May be I should send them this idea. All in all the SAGA of the Golconda fort came to an end with Aurangzeb the merciless ruler who destroyed the the prosperous regime of the Golconda empire. What a fantastic day for me! :D I came to know so many stories today. The rocks of the fort have seen them all but they stay calm and quite as ever.

We returned the saga was over and now the butterflies of hunger were hurting my stomach. We had prawns and chicken and I came back home after that............and here I am writing down the experience.

THE MIGHTY SAGA OF THE GOLCONDA FORT WILL LIVE FOREVER.......as the fort will never die.
Living with roommates is a very unique experience. However it is up to you how you go about it. Your house can be like a hotel with different people staying in it, minding their own business, cooking for themselves or it can be a wonderful, funny place. A real home away from home. That happens when you make an effort to connect with your roomies and make it a point to do some things together. My seniors have always managed to cheer me up every time I felt down. Life here for me has been filled with moments of homesickness. Disappointments. Depression. Hunger. Financial crunch... And yet I laugh at most times and bury myself in work at the other times. A bunch of seniors who have helped me out since the day i landed are...  Life is fast right now. I wake up each day and by the time I crash down again, all is a blur. I still can't digest that it has been two whole months since I boarded that flight from Muscat and arrived at Chicago- not knowing a soul here! Life gets tough once in a while but i find myself laughing more than ever thanks to these people :)  As the song goes- its the climb!

I promise, I swear, I'm going to introduce myself to you.  I wrote it in my head on the drive home and then I got home.  Yup...home..to the sound of Niagara Falls, well okay maybe the Humber River. 

I admit it.  There are certain times when I really, really wish I had a boyfriend or a husband.  It's not Valentine's Day or on my birthday.  It's not when I'm lying around on a leisurely weekend morning (what the hell is that again??).  It's when something breaks down.  Let me set women's lib back here.  I don't have a clue how things work or how to fix them...and I have no desire in knowing!  I'm brutal!!! My mother could build a radio out of paperclips, some toothpaste and an old Readers Digest or something.  Not me.  Nope. 

So here were Will and I were a few hours ago.  Hot water pouring out of my hot water heater; sopping into my crappy yet functioning carpet; Will clinging to me because of course I let out a string of profanities when I realized what was happening. 

I ran over to my next door neighbours, you know to ask her husband how to get the hot water off because of course - I didn't know and it never crosssed my mind that she would know.  But with Jo's support...I figured it out and got the hot water off!   Her husband was probably hiding because in the last two months I've had him try to open the gas tank of my bbq that I thought was stuck when it was actually all the way open; and to try and open my car hood because I couldn't for some reason (neither could he thank GOD).

To top it off though - poor Will.  He was not himself when he got home.  We got upstairs and he started to wail and just wanted to lie on top of me and point at things on the tv.  He still wanted to eat something but as soon as that was done, he assumed the position - wailing and clutching at me.  I start to troubleshoot.  Teeth?  Constipated?  Strange alien living in his stomach about to burst forward?  What was it and how can I fix it????  I decide I must get him naked and check him out from top to bottom.  BOTTOM.  His poor bottom.  Red as a firetruck.  A pound of zincofax later and some tylenol and Will is back - dancing and laughing.

 



 

CRISIS ADVERTED.  Do I care about how to fix my furnace?  Nope don't give a rats ass.  Do I want a medical degree so I can figure out what's wrong with my boy?? Bring me the text books now.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Oh and now I wait.  Will has gone for a sleepover at his aunt's house and I wait for the contractor who may be here before 11 or may not be.  So...totally...irritating.  Good thing I washed the old hair this morning or I'd be baseball hatting it to work tomorrow.  WOO HOO!  They just called and are coming!!!
Prologue - Colin returns from the groceries store...opens his apartment door...and what does he see?
Dignam waiting with a suppressed pistol all geared up for a perfect kill. He raises his pistol and points at Colin.
Colin,who takes a moment to register the situation, reacts with "OK"(accepting it, sort of).
Dignam fires...

Wat was the reason for Colin's indifferent reaction?
1-->He was pissed off with his damn life
2-->He thought he deserved (with a sense of guilt) to die...
3-->He knows there is no way out of it

...........................
...........................

okay folks... you can stop scratching your heads now coz this is definitely not some cat compre question! ;P
Its the final scene from the movie 'The Departed'(...rings a bell?) and if u haven't watched the movie, i suggest u do (one of Martin Scorsese's best). So, you might wonder, what has it got to do with what im about to write? n what the heck is genoesis?!? (atleast i got you wondering now :P)

Well, it all started with one of those regular "debates"(u can substitute "combats" :P)with a friend of mine. Being big time movie analysers(what to do...gotta find some work! ;P), we were arguing about Matt Damon's(Colin's) reaction in the final scene of the movie . "Colin accepted his fate with remorse(ready to die) for all that he has done n happened..." was my fren's side of the argument..in contrast to mine that he(Colin) accepted his fate coz he knows thers no escape under the circumstance. Each of us tried to convince the other but only in vain.The argument, of course ended up with no conclusion..

Now you may have your own version(i wonder what the original version is if there is one) of this depending on what you infer and all of us may feel correct at our own reasons . The reasons which are the psychological result of learning and perception ....the perception of one's mind which involves one's life in the making.. n life which varies from person to person(deep huh?). This very insight gives an insight into how distinct the psychology of a homosapien can be from a  fellow homosapien..

So, here i am, coming up with the name GENOESIS(GEet(a)+ NOESIS)...unique n me, on a journey...where im not only the player, exploring and exploiting the 'noesis' part of me, but also a spectator just watching the way it leads to.
Possums Will Eat Anything.

 I'm in such a weird place in my life right now. I'd love to say I'm at a crossroads, but that implies I have some very clear direction to either side of me and that's not the case. I'm more inclined to want to say I'm at a roundabout.


I can choose to make an exit at some point in the circle and see how that works for me or I can keep going round and round and round.

At the moment, let's just say I feel sort of dizzy. 


As I write, I'm at my daughter's house sitting in the baby's room. I should specify there is no actual baby in this room yet. He is currently living at 100 SW. Uterus with an estimated arrival date of July 3. He's a pistol, this one. Kitten's tiny 5'2" body has had a heck of a time trying to accommodate this fella. Today we found out she has hydronephrosis, which is no damn fun. She's in pain and she pees roughly every 1.3 seconds.


I made her banana pudding - cause that's what Southern mommas do when they don't know what else to do. 

I took her to IHOP and bought her a man-sized breakfast at 3 in the afternoon. When the waitress asked "bacon or sausage" Kitten said "BOTH!" I just drank my coffee, ate my French Toast and tried to keep my fingers away from the consumption zone.



The only other time I've ever heard noises like I heard coming from my baby girl was when I was married to my second husband living large in rural Hell and I found a possum eating something one of the farm cat's had thrown up.

You're welcome.


Right now, at this very moment, I can hear Kitten & Dog (my son) laughing hysterically from the other room. They each have such distinct laughs, but they share an insane sense of humor, which I like to believe they got at least in part, from me. I adore them so much. They know I love them, of course. I'm just not sure they understand I'd totally make them banana pudding for breakfast from now until forever if it made them happy. That's probably a good thing. 

So round and round I continue go. But right now, in this blue room, listening to the most beautiful sound on Earth, it's OK. I'm OK.

I may even try it with my eyes closed.
A Walk to Remember - When i started my Blog I swore to myself  I wouldn’t write a review for a movie ever..ever..  I broke that promise today…Shit!  Anyway while my conscience in in remission,I might as well talk about this movie and mind you ..The book too..  I read “A walk to remember” by Nicholas Sparks when i was in 11th grade…Now being the typical die hard romantic that i am ,I absolutely loved this book…For me there exist very few books that move me …emotionally..  I cried while reading this book…not many people can do that to you…I must say stirring emotions on celluloid is comparatively easier….  By far I have seen very few movies that  have perfectly adapted a book… For all those LOTR fans,they would agree the movie  adaptation was one of the best(though i can’t comment as i haven’t read the book..I know…Shame on me..!)  I also remember reading “Man,Woman and child” by Eric Segal…later realizing the storyline was used in tons of movies in various languages…(remember “masoom”??)  “A walk to remember” too was beautifully adapted…  Even After watching the movie more than 10  times now..i always cry ..  By far one of my favorite movies..  watch the movie for the book,for Nicholas Sparks ,Mandy Moore and of course for Shane west!!!  :)
The last working day of last week turned out to be a rather bare… oops I mean sour… Hey I can actually say bare considering the fact that I realized the hard way how difficult it is being bare-foot in a country like ours. It was around 6:15 Friday evening. I usually have this devilish pleasure in getting up from my place only after 6: 25 for the 6 30 bus , fleeing down the stairs and catching the bus right in the nick of time but yesterday by some strange coincidence I decided to get up at 6 17 itself. I bade my good bye and made a balle-ish turn when suddenly SNAPP! The thin black strap of my even thinner black sandal had decided to popp out of its holder and leave me one slipper less. Oh no! wat to I do now??!! was my immediate reaction. Nothing much considering the fact there was noo way I could get another pair of slippers in an 8000 strong office built in some god forsaken place off city limits unless it rained shoes or I shamelessly stole it from one of my sweet colleagues.
When March comes in like a lamb it goes out like a lion. I am not looking foward to the lion part, but we are enjoying the lamb days. After the worst winter in recorded history, literally, we are grateful that a taste of spring has arrived. One of the benefits of living with another stay at home mom is the babysitting trade. This particular morning my sister had taken three of the kids down to the creek while I had some downtime (which included a 20 minute nap). Then I took 3 kids to the park while she had some quiet time. We took Lucy's tea set and had a tea party with snacks before they hit the equipment.




Some of those kids logged 5 hours of outside time that day! Forecast for the next 4 days, rain! How does that saying go, spring showers bring...?

Strange Competitions

What is the strangest competition you have ever been involved in? BE HONEST!! I will tell you one of mine, my family was competing to see who could have the lowest blood pressure. A while ago I was put on some new medication for my blood pressure and in order to monitor the medication's effectiveness I was to take my blood pressure often. I left the cuff downstairs for easy access (I try to minimize trips up the stairs). One day I was checking it while everyone was sitting around the table and my family wanted to know my numbers. You might be thinking, ah how sweet, they were concerned about me. Well you would be wrong, they just wanted to know what numbers they had to beat! My sister, my mother, my dad, my husband, and my brother all had to have a turn. You probably want to know the scores, well...I lost, even on medication I had the highest score (not a good thing with blood pressure). I love my family even if they do come up with some wacky competitions. Your turn!
looking back…  It's been a year since my life changed for the better...since i joined Art of living...Life has never been the same...Life has been a celebration ever since...I did my basic course last May.Still remember the last day of the course.it was drizzling whn i was returning home.I kept singing 'Jai jai radha raman' on may back...the raindrops falling on my face...the world never seemed more beautiful!!! The very next month i was lucky enough to do advance course with Meghal bhaiya. those days of silence are amongst the most beautiful days of my life.Also i met some really wonderful people there who have become real good friends now.There's no looking back since then.so many courses with so many amazing teachers....new experiences,new learnings...and with each course,life takes a new turn.It's been a wonderful journey so far which has enriched me in terms of knowledge,spirituality and even my daily interactions with others.One year of bliss and what better way to celebrate the anniversary than an advance course with Guruji himself !!! Am on my way to ashram next week for advance course in the divine presence of Guruji.It's my first visit to ashram and am so excited about it :)
P.S -Life is nothing to be very serious about. Life is a ball in your hands to play with. Don't hold on to the ball. —Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
Saturday the 10th of May 2008, turned out to be a pleasant and sunny surprise. I got up in the morning, quite early for Saturday standards, and decided to get geeky. So I went around the libraries of the Uni, finally found the books I wanted, and borrowed them. But somehow I was not happy about studying in the serious and studious atmosphere of the library. So I decided to get back to Insterburg (my hostel) and have lunch, and think about it. As I was cooking, I asked my corridor mates, who were lunching, where they studied usually.. And Christian Boese, (the 30 year old guy whose daughter’s name is Salomi) told me that his favorite place is the Schlossgarten (the garden behind the castle of Karlsruhe). I got interested in the idea of studying out in the open, and asked him for more details. He was like ” I am going there today, to study with a couple of friends. You can join us  “. So after getting ready with my books and everything, we set off. Since I dint have a bike, Christian offered a ride on his, and we rode through the forest. It was brilliant, cause the flowers were just popping out, and the afternoon was hot and cool at the same time! We reached, and lo! I discovered that there is a lake behind the castle, which is (even though dirty) quite a great supplement to the green grass of the summer. So we chose a nice place under the trees, half-shadowy, lest we fall asleep due to the cosiness of the shades. And there was this bunch of Spaniards from my hostel, who were chilling, hogging sandwiches, playing different types of drums, listening to music and stuff. There was this group of guys who tied slack lines between the trees, and were trying to walk on them from one end to another. And trust me, after trying it, I realized how little balance I had..  Anyway, after 3 hours of studying, or maybe a bit more, we went to the Marktplatz to have an icecream, and walked around a bit, and finally rode back. For me, the entire aspect of studying outside was refreshing, after realizing that I am a computer addict, crouched all day on my laptop. And all the nature and the sun did do us all good, and in my case, shook me out of my room finally
How to Market a Litigation Support Practice
Marketing to attorneys was on the mind of a document imaging executive when he called recently to talk about appropriate business development campaigns. This small firm has a limited budget and a definite need to sell more services to lawyers. 

Here are some suggestions we offered on how to market a litigation practice:
Market to existing law firm clients. Current clients are almost always your best source of immediate new revenue. You already enjoy a trusting relationship with them, and they need you to stay in touch.
E-newsletters are an inexpensive, effective way to stay in touch with your current list. Constant Contact or other similar services work very nicely.
Attend local bar association meetings, with an emphasis on groups that focus on plaintiff or defense litigators.
Write articles about your litigation support topics for bar association newsletters.
Keep your referral network primed, for favorable word-of-mouth referrals.
Try Google AdWords for online advertising.
There are many other ways to market a litigation support practice also. Call to discuss your marketing needs.

How could God deal with all His billions and billions of children at a time?? We find it difficult to multitask few of our activities... How can God possibly be noting us evvvery millisecond.. and decide what we deserve .. the law of Karma as they call it.. Whom will he watch!! How many eyes could He have!! Then i started thinking- ok, if God can make such complicated human beings, each having different DNA.. and hence different characters , write unique algorithms for each individual.. how easily he would have made a dummy box called the computer!! the sooper computer.. artificial intelligence et al!! and servers with giga tera square memory .. He probabaly would have a random number generator (RNG) continuously stirring out numers.. and each of us would be assigned one. Then there would be an algo which randomly assigns each of us a time of birth ( that would be linked to another 2 numbers dad n mom immediatly - these three will be our primary key :) - )
Recently in my mummy group, all the kids have been asking about death. I have to admit that with my Elf, it's more a case of Mum, why does Darth Vader die? than What happened to your nana and grandad? I heard two funny stories this week from my group and just had to blog them for your amusement.

The great fish tank in the sky
Elf's best friend, Woody, had a fish tank for Christmas. Woody's mum said he hadn't noticed that three fish had already died in the last few weeks, but when the fourth one had the misfortune to go belly-up, she thought she'd approach the subject with Woody. In the meantime, Woody's dad had, he thought discretely, flushed it down the loo.

She tried to console him by explaining that his fishie had been poorly. Woody was in floods of tears at this point, being a sensitive soul. Wondering why she'd gone down the route of trying to explain death to Woody, his mum said yes his little fishie did die, but he was going to the Great Fish Tank in the Sky and that he would be happier there.
This year I had the opportunity to create and donate several paintings to Christmas Auctions that benefit local charities. The challenge was to paint a "Christmas Card" image. I haven't heard yet about the opening night but I am hopeful that all the cards sell. The various approaches in different mediums was very inspiring - these could really make great gifts any time of the year. My studio is in a spare bedroom in my house - a common situation for many painters - and the standard ceiling lighting is inadequate. A few years ago I replaced the ceiling fixture with a florescent fixture, which flooded the room with bright light but made it difficult to accurately judge color. I added a fixture above the west-facing window and used a floor lamp in one corner, but these fixes still did not give me the lighting I desired.
To Die For...
Tic Tac Tic !!!
Well!!! its not the clock I am talking about, neither its that silly game of cross and zeros.
I am talking about those sexy heels which make a women look seductive and adds to that omph... factor
Silly thought I know... but its quite enticing as well (in men's perspective of course it is ;))
First thing that pops in my mind is the sex diva 'MERLIN MONROE ' her white halter dress with a visibly evident cleavage accessoried with those great pair of jimmy choo pencil heels. Is so avid in my mind :) and just a wild thought but in my opinion it was the heels that made her look so stunning and suggestive. It was only that heels that accentuated her very shapely calves and made them look so desirous . Had she been in a normal peep toe or wedge heel she would have looked so ordinary. But the whole ensemble with her luscious red lips and a pout to die for and halter backless dress and don't forget those heels in my opinion has been the most seductive and orgasmic female ever. ( Just her mere glimpse can make a man hard)
Lets not restrict ourselves to yesteryear ladies we will explore nut before that talking of celluloid and 70 mm silver screen it was Hollywood that gave sex to the film industry worldwide and were the first to make it so buyable ... with not just raunchy explicit and hot scenes but otherwise... And heels played an integral part in this even classics like "sound of music" and "my fair lady" it was out an out a heely affair with those drappy gowns well covered necklines very elegantly put accessories was indeed a fine mix but it used to be the pointed pencil shoes in those shiny colors wine red and ebony black that made the entire look so grand.
Heels are commodity every women craves for and its makes the men to crave for her ;) Thanks to Versace and Armani that they widened their horizons and went beyond just designing outfits. Thanks to Gucci for those lovely boots and every well known designer who now dabbles in shoes. From flats to wedge heels, from block to pencil heels and kitten heels to peep toe there is a wide range for girls and ladies to satiate their thirst to look and feel sexy.
Now you not just need a sexy or a lacy lingerie to impress your man even heels could do wonders... :)

so...
to woo a man it's not silk and ooze its simple ' JUST STILETTOS' ;)
A month ago I decided to research studio lighting and discovered that many experts suggest a variety of lighting sources and types. I've included links to some of those sites at the end of this post. I understood the obstacles to lighting that I had: West and North facing windows, a ceiling fixture, a room about 11 x 11, and not wanting a major lighting project that would make it difficult to convert the space back into a bedroom if the need arose.

The research I did led me to conclude that I needed multiple light sources that I could control, a way to avoid glare and, conversely, shadows by diffusing the light. I needed task lighting that I could direct down on my work space, and I needed lighting that could work for me both in daylight and at night.

I ended up with a compromise in what I could do. First, I replaced the ceiling florescent fixture with one from the home improvement store that allows me to direct the light. This fixture uses 50 watt GU10 bulbs and the light does have a yellow cast.
Bad mood? Don't make me fight you.

Me to Tanner, the tiny Yorkie: I feel you are not hearing me lately, Tan. I am feeling like when I talk, it's as though you don't understand a word I'm saying. When you choose to lick the spot where your balls used to be rather than engaging with me in a meaningful way, it makes me feel like I'm not valuable as a person.

Mr. Man: Why are you talking to the dog like you two are in therapy?

Me:  Because the dog is being a douche. By the way, I left all the laundry in the dryer except for my personal stuff. 

Mr. Man: That's just like you. You always leave the laundry in the dryer. And how is it a dog can be a douche? I don't think you are even using that word correctly.

Me: Just like me? Listen Jackson, I pulled ten years hard time in this institution doing YOUR laundry. I mean HARD time. You were a cop, for godsake. Have you ANY idea how hard it is to clean the underwear of The Law after a night of fighting crime? Laundry is your thing now, Mister Man. Suck on that. The dog is being douchey, by the way, with his whining and his nails clicking across the floor and whatnot. It's a perfectly appropriate word to use when a dog is fulfilling all the requirements of douchedom. 

Mr. Man: You should go to bed.

Me: I will fight you. I mean it. Right here. Put 'em up. I will flat mess you up in ways you have only heard about in childhood stories told by your drunken uncles as a means of taking their minds off their utterly miserable and completely uninteresting existence as husbands to some of the ugliest women in the state of Kansas. I will open up a can of legendary Hillbilly Whoopass right up on you until you beg me to turn you loose and let you participate in the sweet release that is the doing of laundry.  

Mr. Man: You're going to Kitten's this weekend, right? Maybe you should get a head start. I think we have weather coming. 

Me: That's right. Walk away, old man. And take the little dog with you.
The peace = Happiness formula! I think I finally found it...no not a Eureka moment, cause it had been there always...ALWAYS..just that sometimes, it takes sometime to really understand how 'true' the whole concept is!

Lately I have been too out of my elements...too many things keeping me occupied..too many things to think about...too many things to make a mental note of..too many things to cope up with..too many things hanging off the cliff it seems! BUT..finally I have sorted it out! Even though the things are exactly same as they were 'bout a week..rather mayb even 1 month back..but now there is a difference!

I think over years the way I had groomed myself, I had made it a point not to get into the expectation web and managed to stay relatively calm and composed and happy (in the public eye atleast!)..and I think I need to get back to the same me!

Expectations are a killer...if things are not right..expecting anything from anyone won't better things, in fact if and when the expectations fail..the misery is worse!

Hence...I am calm...I am composed...and I am saintly ;-)
From Millesime Bio to Galicia! (Part 1)
February 27, 2010
When I was in MB, otherwise known as Millesime Bio, Frederik Kolderup, the energetic Norwegian wine importer, coffee fanatic who travels with his own grinder, and lover of the more nat'l the better, ordered me to check an American making albarino in Rias Biaxis.

Hell, you know me, good 'ole skeptic.

But it was Frederik, so I did.

What I found was Albarino that wasn't: 1) sweet 2) tropical 3) sauvignon blancish 3) creamy.

Not only that but the winemaker and part owner of 
Benito Santos--Todd Blomberg-- an American who fell in love with a Galician and has lived there for a decade--is working naturally, with a brain that keeps on ticking. He's intent on eliminating S02 usage. His method involved a butter churner.

Blomberg only makes albarino and is working on single vineyards. Two elements that drew me to his wines were: a lovely bitterness and a fresh, attention grabbing acidity. You see, acidity is something that I've found lacking in albarino of late as trying to appeal to a mass palate, too many winemakers are deacidifying, capturing sweetness in the wine, and basically reconfiguring nature, reasons I stopped drinking the stuff.

According to Todd, the Benito Santos vines have never used chemicals and the wines had never been yeasted or whatevered.

Impressed, I contacted Todd and asked him when I was in town to be on a panel about wine homogenization, could I visit? He in turn offered to take me around. An offer I could not refuse.
A calm.. sunday evening… me and grandma walk along the dusty roads and reach the destination two streets away..It was my first time to an astrologer’s! Boy! I was excited! I have never really believed in it and was eager to see what it was all about…  We reached the place and aunty led us to the room where my friend’s thatha who is the astrologer was sitting. The 92 year old smiling man led us in. He was all of five feet, occupying 1/5th of his huge bed. Wasting no time, he took the horoscope from me. He had told us not to tell him what we had come for. He said he would find out! Hmm! Loves challenges I suppose… ! He casually flipped to the page where the boxes were drawn. Then started the intense calculations… His frail tiny hands jumped from one box to another … his hands ran along the boxes the way we used to do when we used to play snakes and ladder… He then erupted into a smile… HE is the reason for you coming here he announced pointing to “Venus”.!!! LOL!
Well, as you might have picked up from my front page, I'm a late-20's missus living in the gorgeous Hawkesbury region of North-West Sydney with the lovely Mr.P, my hubby of just over a year.

I've been living out here for about 6 years after growing up in the 'Macarthur Region'...which is a nice way of saying Campbelltown! I didn't technically live IN Campbelltown, I lived about 10 mins outside (the Sydney-side...smug much....lol!)...in the lovely suburb of St. Andrews.

I grew up there with 3 sisters and a brother, the greatest siblings a gal could ask for (although my sibling-in-laws...2 sisters, 2 brothers...are pretty damn cool too!).

I love lots of different things and always have some obsession going...be it knitting, scrapbooking, a tv show, painting, colouring-in (I LOVE colouring-in, most relaxing thing), blogging, tweeting, facebook-ing, Sims 3, Wii, a book series, I can't help myself. I tend to get really into something and let it go after a while, then pick it up again, but one thing I can't stop doing, is reading.
DESPAIR
A social worker friend of mine who works with low-income families wrote recently on Facebook,
Today was a bad day. There is so much despair out there. I think I need a new career.

Another social worker commented to her,
I know what you mean. This is the worst I've seen it in 30 years. 

And a friend who is a principal of a school in southeastern Michigan, a school with a high number of children living in poverty, told me,
The economic stresses on these families are unbelievable. Their instability in housing and jobs keeps them moving all the time. We enroll new kids in the school, and have kids leave the school, every week because of the instability.
And if a school has 30% turnover from the beginning to the end of the year, is it fair to measure kids' progress the way that we do in a school with 5% turnover?

When I was teaching, I remember kids coming up to me and saying, "There is too much chaos in my house (housing issues, immigration fears, lack of employment, etc.) and I just can't do my homework." For some kids, just making it to school is the miracle.

I know a lot of people are worried about those families. We think less often about the front-line workers--by which I mean, in this case, social workers and school staff--who confront increasing need and decreasing resources. I worry about the front-line staff. It is really hard to hear the public discussions around education and social services, to hear that teachers or social workers "get paid too much," to have pay and benefits rolled back, and not to acknowledge that it is hard to be the social worker or teacher working with the kids or families who need so much more, who deserve so much more, and who don't get what they need.

Sure, in our area there is a surfeit of teachers and social workers--so maybe they are replaceable, but is it a good thing to set up a system where teachers and social workers get burned out because there is so much need for their services and so little value placed upon them?

My friend was writing about the despair among her clients, but what I hear from her is the despair that things will get better. We alone cannot control the economy (of course, we can each do our small part), but when we value the work of front-line staff, we can improve their feelings about their work.

Googlewashing?
Over at Electric Educator (linked to on the right), blogger and teacher John Sowash had a post recently about the advantages of using iGoogle to replace school planners. 

It makes me feel queasy.

Full disclosure: Blogspot (the platform for this blog) is Google-owned and yes, I have a gmail account. Sharing documents on googledocs can make life easy. I "google" questions several times a day. Google creates a lot of wonderful products. 

But. Google is also a huge corporation, trading today at $531 per share.

I have no problem with individuals using Google, but that seems different to me from having teachers require students to put their work into systems that are owned by a huge, for-profit corporation. Are we in danger of Googlewashing?

What do you think? What are the benefits? What are the issues? If we had to pay for it, what would it be worth?
Goonj~ ek unsuni cheekh !!
Goonj an echo I heard within me when I saw the most nervewracking cliping of my life...
Two ladies came to aur old campus fondly called the (VKC) from a NGO called goonj. Due to torrential rains my spirits were equally dampened as the roads of our city. My step grew heavy as I entered our studio and saw two ladies, one salt and papper hair and the other a lovely damsel made the ambience very mirthful and informal with their spontaneous chutzpah...
Like all other lectures they had the usualy projector and had something to show. But inside it they had something which I never sensed or see.
Though a very bizzare way of telling what this organization dose but was a relevation of a kind.
Goonj worked on the concept of "Kapda, Roti, Makkan" and focus on primarily on Kapda.
The gooseflesh story began when the head of goonj came in forefront to address the crowd.
"I know I am discussing a topic which in the 21st century is still considered a taboo and I want it to a dining table issue" He talked about how the rural female survives those five days evry month. Yes I am talking about the mensuration cycle. Well you will be surprized to know that they use the same cloth repeatedly for days or pices of rags. The terror is hear to come when I heard that a women dies of titnis they also use sand and due to different cycles in a family women use the same cloth.
I know its awful, I would never have gathered enough courage to out it on my blog but this is where we as human beings need to be aware.
Everybody tallks of education, sanitaion, health and literacy but we never ponder about the taboo subjects. Now the owner of this NGO says that " we have so many festivals like diwali, dushera and other but there should be a giving festival where we give". So Goonj has started a nation wide drive from 27th september to 4th october. So give and celebrate. Collect material from clothing to paper. Goonj is now working for 2 decades and have done immense work acrooss india. Be it Bihar or Tsunami hot victims down south. The NGO is working endlessly making rugs out of audio tapes, skipping ropes from duppattas, Under garments so on and so forth. School bags from discarded demins and many other things.
This Goonj within me will never fade. My soul will always burn since I envision to make this unheard goonj heard.
We had such a fun weekend! It started Friday night when I went out for a lingerie shower/bachelorette party. We went out to Northgate, the big college bar area. I've never been and I realized why Friday night. The bride to be is in her early 20's as were most of her friends. After drinks and gifts, we went to a few bars. At one bar the guy at the door actually looked at my ID and asked if it was really my ID!?!? Really, if I was a college kid using a fake ID to get into a bar, it would not say I'm 30! I just felt old, but I had a good time!


Saturday, we went to Nathan and Mandi's wedding. It was smack in the middle of Alex's nap time so we put her down for an early nap and crossed our fingers that she wouldn't melt down during the festivities. She was super antsy at the ceremony so Josh took her to the atrium to run around so she didn't disrupt the wedding. Alex had a BLAST at the reception. She loved being on the dance floor. We had to hold her so she wouldn't interrupt the first dances. There was another little girl a couple of years older that Alex loved playing and dancing with. She totally hammed it up. At one point, the photographer bent down to take a picture of them together, Alex noticed it, pushed the other girl away so she wouldn't be in the pic and smiled for the camera. Total cheese ball! When they started the dollar dance, Alex walked up to Nathan and put her hands up so he could pick her up to dance. It was the cutest thing ever! We went to dinner with Mark and Veronica when we left. Alex wouldn't eat any shrimp until we gave her cocktail sauce to dip them in. She eats soooo much better if she can dip her food in stuff.

We all slept in Sunday morning, thank you time change, then had a late breakfast. After breakfast, we went to Lowes. Alex loves looking at all the flowers. We picked out some flowers for the beds in the front. We literally spent an hour digging out bulbs that I planted 2 years ago. They don't bloom anymore, but they still sprout grass like leaves all year long. I swear, I planted like 20 and they multiplied. I promised to never plant bulbs again! Alex had so much fun outside. She was such a busy body moving dirt from pot to pot, picking up leaves, playing with mulch and smelling the flowers. She learned how to open the front door and decided to let Cooper out, then she kept going in and out and in and out.

I didn't take one picture all weekend, but we spent more time outside today and I took a ton of pics. Alex and I picked up Subway, then picked up Josh and went to the park for lunch. Since I already know my kiddo hates lunch meat, I got her a pizza from Subway. She loved it...Josh and I thought it was kinda gross, but oh well, she ate a 1/4 of it!
After she woke up from her nap, we went out front to play some more! Alex decided it was sooo much more fun to have Coopie outside with us!
Work has been pretty exhausting lately due to the fact that lots of my students have horrid home lives, which eats me up. I think about them 24/7 and haven't even been sleeping well lately because I feel so burdened with all this. It's just not fair, and the worst part is that the system is faulty, so even when the correct people are notified, nothing changes. It's tragic. We just love on them as much as we can while they are with us, and then pray for them when they get on that bus in the afternoon. It's heart breaking. Needless to say, I am so pumped for Spring Break and I'm ready for the fun and stress-free activities. We aren't doing anything near as cool as we did last year, but we do have some good local stuff planned...
Saturday-going out to eat and downtown (Ft. Worth) with a big group of friends. FUN!!!
Sunday-headed to Ray Roberts Lake State Park to meet my cousins and Uncle for a day of nature and relaxing.
Zac has track practice each morning Monday-Wednesday, but I plan on sleeping late! ;)
Tuesday night we are taking the distance runners (the athletes Zac coaches) out to eat and to bowl. It will be lots of fun and the kids have already been asking about it.
Thursday night Liz, Andy, Madeline and Owen will arrive to stay for the weekend. We are going to hang out and have fun around here Friday, and then Saturday the McKinney cousins and their families are coming down for the day. Yay!
Anyways, doesn't sound like much, but I know the week will FLY by!!
Health officials have been tackling the difficult question of how to apportion mechanical ventilators in a severe influenza pandemic when the demand far exceeds the availability of the treatment. Yesterday, a prestigious group of advisors to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moved closer to delivering their guidance.

A subcommittee of independent ethicists approved, with minor changes, what it terms a draft ethical framework to help federal, state, and local policymakers develop guidelines about which patients should receive ventilators. The document, prepared by a group of CDC and non-CDC employees that met for more than two years, will now go to the full advisory committee to the CDC for approval. At yesterday's meeting, the subcommittee agreed to a request from CDC leadership that the document state it would not apply to the current H1N1 or "swine flu" pandemic unless a significantly more severe or widespread strain appeared.

As we reported yesterday, the guidance suggests that health care workers dealing with a pandemic assign patients a score based on several factors, such as their need for ventilators, their likelihood of survival, and their years of expected life. The document also suggested that maximizing the health of the public in a disaster by directing ventilators to those with the best chance of recovery be weighed against giving all patients with a reasonable prognosis "a fair chance at survival." The group advised against factoring an individual's perceived contributions to society into decisions about allocating scarce ventilators.

The subcommittee embraced the controversial idea that hospitals could remove from ventilators patients whose prognosis had significantly worsened, regardless of their wishes, and provide those ventilators to those with a better prognosis. However, the document advises policymakers to include the public in "frank dialogue and genuine deliberation" about the various tradeoffs among the ethical principles.

The public was able to listen to the subcommittee's teleconference yesterday by calling a toll free number. The vote to approve the document, which was unanimous among subcommittee members who attended the meeting, took place before the scheduled public comment period.

A CDC official who helped run the meeting said, "there are a lot of members of the public on the call today." The exact number and their identities were unclear. They were invited to make comments, but only two chose to do so.

A caller who identified herself as Marcia Baker argued that the government should "build for the peak of a severe pandemic" rather than focusing on categorizing patients into what she referred to as "polite terms for lives not worthy to live."

Harvard University ethics professor Norman Daniels responded that he was "very puzzled" by Baker's comments. "It seems you're suggesting we could purchase ventilators to meet any crisis," he said. "I'd like to know whether you want to pay the taxes."

Baker said, "Yes, and not pay the bailout."

Daniels countered. "You don't want a functioning economy but you want all these ventilators?"

Drue Barrett, chair of the CDC's public health ethics committee, said that the ethics guidance discusses "the importance of building our infrastructure to meet public health needs." She said the full advisory committee to the CDC director will meet within the next two months to consider the ventilator guidance.

Politico's Josh Gerstein offers more details on the discussion, and Christopher Weaver of Kaiser Health News has this interesting take on NPR's Health Blog.
If i were to use the word "give up", it doesn't seems to apply on me.
I don't exactly know what to do because at this moment, i can't solve this problem alone.
I need you God.
Please help me to overcome all these barriers for making me to feel this way.

When i get to see him, i feel all messed up.
My feelings go all ways, i don't feel good.
When i don't get to see him, you know, the feelings when you yearn to see someone so badly?
Wanting to know how is he doing and all.
But what about if the person is opposing you in everything you do?
I wanted to tell him that i hate him yesterday.
Because i'm lost for words.
I don't know what can i do to describe him anymore.
Maybe it's a good thing for him, but definitely a no for me.

God, you need to help me to persevere till the very end.


Realized something odd?
Yep, i've changed my blogskin. Something was wrong with the font from my previous blogskin.
And if you're a constant reader, you'd know this is the one i used before my previous's.
Anyway, i removed the chatbox. And dear friends, if you feel like commenting, sorry that i've to trouble you guys.
Please do comment below each posts i made.
Thank you.

:)

I need a getaway.
Lenovo's quietly unleashed three new 1080p resolution-boasting monitors. Up first, the 21.5-inch L2261 Wide LCD, a pretty basic affair with VGA and DVI inputs. The L2361p Wide is 23-inches, with a more stylized look than the L2261, with integrated speakers and microphone, a webcam, and three USB 2.0 ports. Finally, the real star of the show, the L2461X Wide is a 23.6-inch, multitouch  display. It also has integrated speakers and microphone, a 2 megapixel webcam. There is no official pricing or availability information for any of these bad boys yet, but there are two more images after the break.
I know its been forever and I keep saying I'll update soon...ahhh!
Anyway, this new year has definietly been better for the Rast Family. I was happy to see 2009 go and welcome in 2010. Which we did with my BFF and her family. It was a blast, and I loved having them here with us:)
Baby S did not go home as planned, that has been put on hold until May now. In the meantime we received 3 busy, busy, blue eyed, blond children, that are keeping us hopping. They are 4, 3, and 8 months. Whew! Lots of fun but lots of work too.
My big kids are doing awesome, with school, TKD, and dance. They are a HUGE help to me at home with the littles. They take them out to play, ride bikes with them and go to the park.
We have a few fun trips planned this year. Summer we will go with our "group" to Boulder Beach in Idaho. The fall we will head to San Diego to celebrate our youngest as a teenager, wow!
So thats the update for now.
I am done for the month! No more freaking exams until april. But then, I am still constantly tortured by never ending homework and assignments and of course, the one and only true love, professional exams! Ugh! I wonder when it can end.... It would be so nice to not needing to wake up in the morning and go like "professional exams again". No no, it would be nice to not needing an alarm clock to make you get up from bed.

Owh well,
on't, let this be a lesson to you! Hair Removal... (I don't have a clue as to who wrote this, but.....WHAT A RIOT!) All hair removal methods have tricked women with their promises of easy, painless removal - The Epilady, scissors, razors, Nair and now...the wax. Read on......... My night began as any other normal weeknight. Come home, fix dinner, play with the kids. I then had the thought that would ring painfully in my mind for the next few hours: 'Maybe I should pull the waxing kit out of the medicine cabinet.' So I headed to the site of my demise: the bathroom. It was one of those 'cold wax' kits. No melting a clump of hot wax, you just rub the strips together in your hand, they get warm and you peel them apart and press them to your (or wherever else) and you pull the hair right off. No muss, no fuss. How hard can it be? I mean, I'm not a genius, but I am mechanically inclined enough to figure this out. (YA THINK!?!) So I pull one of the thin strips out. Its two strips facing each other stuck together. Instead of rubbing them together, my genius kicks in so I get out the hair dryer and heat it to 1000 degrees. ('Cold wax,' yeah...right!) I lay the strip across my thigh. Hold the skin around it tight and pull. It works! OK, so it wasn't the best feeling, but it wasn't too bad. I can do this! Hair removal no longer eludes me! I am She-rah, fighter of all wayward body hair and maker of smooth skin extraordinaire. With my next wax strip I move north. After checking on the kids, I sneak back into the bathroom, for the ultimate hair fighting championship. I drop my panties and place one foot on the toilet. Using the same procedure, I apply the wax strip across the right side of my bikini line, covering the right half of my hoo-ha and stretching down to the inside of my butt cheek (it *was* a long strip) I inhale deeply and brace myself....RRRRIIIPPP!!!! I'm blind!!! Blinded from pain!!!!....OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!!! Vision returning, I notice that I've only managed to pull off half the strip. CRAP! Another deep breath and RIPP! Everything is spinning and spotted. I think I may pass out...must stay conscious...must stay conscious. Do I hear crashing drums??? Breathe, breathe...OK, back to normal. I want to see my trophy - a wax covered strip, the one that has caused me so much pain, with my hairy pelt sticking to it. I want to revel in the glory that is my triumph over body hair. I hold up the strip. There's no hair on it. Where is the hair??? WHERE IS THE WAX??? Slowly I ease my head down, foot still perched on the toilet. I see the hair. The hair that should be on the strip...it's not! I touch. I am touching wax. I run my fingers over the most sensitive part of my body, which is now covered in cold wax and matted hair. Then I make the next BIG mistake...remember my foot is still propped upon the toilet? I know I need to do something. So I put my foot down. Sealed shut! My butt is sealed shut. Sealed shut! I penguin walk around the bathroom trying to figure out what to do and think to myself 'Please don't let me get the urge to poop. My head may pop off!' What can I do to melt the wax? Hot water!! Hot water melts wax!! I'll run the hottest water I can stand into the bathtub, get in, immerse the wax-covered bits and the wax should melt and I can gently wipe it off, right??? *WRONG!!!!!!!* I get in the tub - the water is slightly hotter than that used to torture prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment - I sit. Now, the only thing worse than having your nether regions glued together, is having them glued together and then glued to the bottom of the tub...in scalding hot water. Which, by the way, doesn't melt cold wax.So, now I'm stuck to the bottom of the tub as though I had cemented myself to the porcelain!! God bless the man who had convinced me a few months ago to have a phone put in the bathroom!!!!! I call my friend, thinking surely she has waxed before and has some secret of how to get me undone. It's a very good conversation starter 'So, my butt and hoo-ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub!' There is a slight pause. She doesn't know any secret tricks for removal but she does try to hide her laughter from me. She wants to know exactly where the wax is located, 'Are we talking cheeks or hole or hoo-ha?' She's laughing out loud by now...I can hear her. I give her the rundown and she suggests I call the number on the side of the box. YEAH!!!!! Right!! I should be the joke of someone else's night. While we go through various solutions. I resort to trying to scrape the wax off with a razor. Nothing feels better than to have your girlie goodies covered in hot wax, glued shut, stuck to the tub in super hot water and then dry-shaving the sticky wax off!! By now the brain is not working, dignity has taken a major hike and I'm pretty sure I'm going to need Post-Traumatic Stress counseling for this event. My friend is still talking with me when I finally see my saving grace....the lotion they give you to remove the excess wax. What do I really have to lose at this point? I rub some on and OH MY GOD!!!!!!! The scream probably woke the kids and scared the dickens out of my friend. It's sooo painful, but I really don't care. 'IT WORKS!! It works!!' I get a hearty congratulation from my friend and she hangs up. I successfully remove the remainder of the wax and then notice to my grief and despair....THE HAIR IS STILL THERE.......ALL OF IT! So I recklessly shave it off. Heck, I'm numb by now. Nothing hurts. I could have amputated my own leg at this point.
Last weekend we went off to Swansea for my brother-in-law's wedding. As Scott was working before the wedding, that meant that he would travel from Surrey to Swansea and I was left with the delightful (ahem!) job of driving to Swansea with the kids. Oh that was fun!

I drove in tandem with Scott's Uncle, so I wasn't completely alone and we stopped off on the way down for a picnic in the services car park, which the kids thought was great! By the time we EVENTUALLY made it to Swansea, we had about half an hour left to go before we made it to the hotel, but it was in the middle of nowhere and it was pitch black. I'm just so grateful for sat nav, because I didn't have a clue where I was, couldn't see a thing, windy narrow country lanes and Charlotte in the back of the car shouting that we were lost!

But, we made it! Woo hoo!

The wedding was an early one - they got married at 10.30 am (erm great - I have me and 3 kids to get ready!), and Charlotte was a bridesmaid, so I had to make sure she was looking especially gorgeous.

The hotel was right by the beach and they chose to have some pictures on the beach (did I mention they're mental?!), it was a lovely sunny day, beautiful in fact, but it was FREEEEEEEZING!

After the wedding breakfast, they showed the rugby match between England and Wales. In fact rugby was the theme of the day and that is why they specifically picked 6th Feb to get married as the groom (Kev) is English and the bride (Nici) is Welsh.

The whole day was fantastic, and we made it through relatively tantrum free (Charlotte did have a slight diva moment).

So I leave you with a few little pictures. Please excuse any with me on - I hate having my photo taken.

Cameron looking very smart in his suit - but not sure what is going on with his expression. He seems to have forgotten how to smile!
First off I was finally convinced to no longer us IE and now I am using chrome and everything is weird and off and the fonts are all screwing with me. Yes, I am late to the party on this .. one of those, I don't like change and I like fire fox even less. So here we are. Not that I ever claimed to know anything about computers, technology or fonts. All I know is that everyone seems to hate comic sans, I now get made fun of for talking pictures with an actual camera and not an i-phone and I am still freaked out by using skype.


Secondly I am finally getting around to reading Julie and Julia. I love her (Julie), I and I am terribly sad I didn't read it before I saw the movie. But whats done is done. The thing is that it does not make me want to blog more but it makes me what to get rid of this entirely. Which leads me to thirdly.

Thirdly I am really started to get irritated with my addiction..errr, facebook. So maybe I should come over here and say all the status I want to have because I am no longer comfortable over there. Mostly because at how angry some people make me. Defriending is not an option. Well, its always an option but I don't need more drama in this area then is already there. And now "hide" isn't working for one person in particular. They creep into my day, UN WELCOMED, and make me all pissy and unhappy and negative. And I am sick of being that person.

Fourth, fourthly? ..... look, I am sorry for those people in Haiti, really sorry, I have donated what I can to the Red Cross, I have sat in horror of seeing those images on the tv. But people comparing the generosity of us giving to charities over this to the health care debacle in congress is a stretch at the very least. The two are in no way comparable. Moving on, I just wanted to get my feelings out on that.

Fifth, the weather is beautiful here. I refuse to fight my child to get him outside. Perhaps we'd all be better with some sun in our faces. I for one am ready for sitting out on the patio with a beer, with something cooking on the grill. But, I am not yet ready for this nice weather. I would appreciate if it went away till the end of February ... there was something comforting about the cold and being stuck inside during this particular time for our household. I am sure that only makes sense to me.
miss her so.
A week prior the trip, I was advised by frds to inform the princess that "mama & papa is gg away" and she needs to stay with popo & yeye. I talk to her abt it many times a day, and each time, she will choose to pretend not to hear and give me smiley faces.
She plays ignorant and it irks me becoz I know she understand what I am talking abt.

2 days before the trip, she gotten really really sticky to us and was such a baby. She started throwing little tantrums and wakes up at night crying. A couple of times, she cried so pitifully after she woke up from her nap that it was heart wrenching to watch.(I informed daddyhan abt it, and I guess it affected him as well, becoz he actually went to check out the SQ website wanting to purchase another ticket to bring her along! Too bad the flight is full.) I understand that she is trying to cope with the news and it hurts me so. The day befre the trip, we brought her to the toy store so she can choose some toys to bring over to popo's hse to play. On the way back in the car, I turned over and told her, "ning, tonite you sleep with popo okie? Be good girl ya." She immediately gave me a sad face and in that whiney tone, said "I wanna sleep with mama"
I cried.

When daddyhan sent her to popo's place, I did not follow. I cannot handle that kinda emotional moments, so I choose to stay hm and kissed her goodbye. When daddyhan came home, he said ning was having so much fun there that she didnt even cy when he had to go. We had been calling back daily, and is glad to learn that she is having tons of fun, is behaving well and had not ask for us at all.

My baby is all grown up now. She actually understands that we are going away and couldnt bring her along. I felt really really assured by her behaviour and is much more relaxed now. Now, if she understands that we are away and couldnt bring her along, then Im sure she understands what daddy meant when he promised to bring an elephant back for her.
Where to find one now?
Or perhaps we should call this one the "non-sick,non-fatigued, non-fat,non-crazy" post. Ahh, honest writing. It's definitely not for everyone.So, we did something fun yesterday besides going to the Arboretum for the third time this week (the girls are loving it and keep asking to go back). I was sitting around with them after everyone was home for the evening and did a search on my flickr stream of each of the girl's names. What came up was a varied, non-sequential, virtual (Insert name here), This Is Your Life, "baby book" that was entirely delightful. I highly recommend it.
Don't have a flickr account? Here, borrow mine (featuring Anna Sofia):
This blog will be short and totally not exciting or entertaining at all. It won't say silly or witty things either. It will simply say that I made my own tooth powder and deodorant today. I used simple ingredients and my new knitting friend showed me how, and even gave me the tools to do so. She also handed me a pamphlet that teaches me to make my own no-shampoo poo (because I don't shampoo my hair and if you have curly hair you shouldn't either - because it's evil and wrong and basically like putting satan in your mane). And really that's it. See, I told you. Totally not exciting or entertaining at all. But I just really wanted to get that out there.

I love you all, except for those I don't know. Because that would be weird.
Obama confidante and senior adviser David Axelrod hit the trifecta Sunday talking health care, health care and lastly, health care on CNN.

White House spokesman Robert Gibbs lent an assist on Fox: …”we’ll have the votes when the House votes.” The rough translation: We won’t vote until we have the votes and/or we don’t have the votes. Not yet anyway, according to the guy counting the noses. House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) says the will is there and the votes will be too. “They (House Dems) have been looking to us to create a way to do it. I think we’ve gotten to a place where we do have the way to do it.”

No joy in Minorityville. House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio vowed to “…do everything we can to make it difficult for them, if not impossible, to pass the bill.”

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) warned Democrats about a kind of political Armageddon if the bill passes. “There will be an instant, spontaneous campaign to repeal it all across the country… and (in November) a political wipeout for the Democratic Party.

Proving that there will be news after health care Boehner says he doesn’t think Congress will approve funds to move terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay prison to a supermax facility on U.S. soil. Certainly you can count him out: “I wouldn’t vote for this if you put a gun to my head.”

Boehner also said there’s a chance Republicans could take over the house this November.
“These stories are what Washington does,” Axelrod, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, said in an interview that aired on CNN’s State of the Union. “When people think there are political challenges, then the ‘palace intrigue’ stories get written and so on. We are a tight group. We are all committed to the same thing and I would discount those stories.”

On a more personal note, Axelrod also spoke favorably of Emanuel, who has a reputation for sometimes being rough around the edges in his political dealings with allies and foes.
This past Monday morning, I decided to just keep Abbey's diaper off after I changed her.  We have been down the potty training road before with her, but it just didn't work - at all!  We had a challenging weekend with her and I'm not sure why I decided to tackle this task, after a rough weekend and on a Monday morning no less, but I did!  I just thought, well, I'll give it a whirl!  I knew it was going to be different this time though, when she sat on the potty without screaming.  When she actually went, it was amazing.  She had a slip up during that first hour going commando, and she also had to realize that she can't stand up while she's still going, but after that, it just clicked! 

So here it is, Friday afternoon and she's had a week without diapers!  It's so exciting!!  We still have to work with her to keep it up while she's got pants on (since she's just been going commando this week mostly), but we're over that first major hurdle!  If she just has underwear on, she takes them off and goes, but for some reason it's different when she has underwear and pants on.  However, we went out this afternoon for a couple of hours and her pull up was dry when we got home!  I was so excited.  Our little girl is doing so well!  We are very proud of her!!

Oh, and do you like her new bangs?  Jonathan tried to help and cut them while she was in the tub.  He forgets that hair gets shorter when it dries!  They're not straight and way too short, but somehow she keeps getting compliments on them.  I'm just thankful that hair grows!
am pumped with my new program and my new eating schedule. The introduction to good fats from nuts is really helping me crave things that I am trying to avoid. It appears to be regulating my blood sugar levels. Yesterday workout was awesome and I burned over 360 calories in less than 55 minutes. Felt great to sweat it out and I feel strong. Today is HIIT and I that felt great!! I am hoping to get another HIIT workout in today. Maybe on the elliptical this time. Maybe another run on the treadmill. Still have not decided.

What I do know is that I have this new found stable energy and that is what I want to focus on. I want to focus on getting to a leaner body and forgetting what the scale says. I will rely more on my measurements of course and how I feel. How my clothes fit and what this good nutrition will do to my skin and nails. Looking forward to it. Planning all my meals each and every night, so that I am ready to face a brand new day -- full of good wholesome stuff.
I'm still here and feeling great. I volunteer at a free medical clinic on Tuesday mornings. I draw blood and it is so gratifying. Today I had something happen that has never happened before. I was looking at a guy's arm for veins and noticed a lot of scarring. I asked him if he gave blood and he said "no." He admitted to being an IV drug user. My heart almost sunk to my stomach. He had used drugs just recently and still had bruises on his arm from it. 

He told me he was sober for 9 months and then started using again. He was in his twenty's. He was negative a year ago for Hepatitis C, but wants to be tested again for it. I could feel my heart beating faster as I stuck him and tapped into his vein. I was so nervous and did not want to get stuck by that needle. 

But here's the rub: I should be nervous every time I draw blood. People with Hepatitis C can look like anyone. I had it and never knew it. I never "shot up" or snorted cocaine. I can't believe I'm back to my ways of letting my guard down. Oh sure, I wear gloves, but to really respect someone's blood as if it could give me a life-threatening disease? I really needed to have this guy as a patient today. It was a gentle reminder to always be careful.
I write about an hour a day and recently broke into six-figure-a-year earnings. This money comes from running advertising on my websites and blogs, all content sites based on nothing more than articles I’ve written. This is largely passive income that comes in whether I work or not (I choose to work so I can continue to grow my earnings).I got started back in early 2004 when, while going to college, I began having trouble with repetitive stress injuries (a bit like carpal tunnel syndrome, except it was my hands that were troubling me instead of my wrists). I started working with voice recognition software, but I realized that it was going to be hard to get a real job working 40+ hours a week at a keyboard. Everything from driving to mousing to opening jars hurt my hands, so I couldn’t imagine what I could do for a living.And… truth be told, I wasn’t that keen on getting a “real job.” I’d done four years as an enlisted soldier in the army and experienced firsthand what it’s like to be a powerless peon at the whims of superior officers, many of whom are only “superior” because they’ve been in the military longer. To this day, I have a great appreciation for those who enlist in the military and serve our country, but it just wasn’t for me. And I had a feeling corporate America wasn’t going to be for me either. I’d always enjoyed writing and when I started my four-year degree, I had a vague notion of becoming a freelance writer (though, as a diehard introvert, the idea of interfacing with clients and touting my own horn to get contracts made me cringe), but the RSI issue threw a wrench in my plans.I started scouring the Internet for ideas on how I could make money from home. I tried eBay for a while, selling beef jerky of all things (the “Oh Boy! Oberto” plant and factory outlets were in my town), but I quickly learned that competing with others who were into price gouging was difficult and hardly worth it for a dollar or two of profit.Eventually I found my way to various webmaster forums where people were talking about a relatively new (at the time) program: Google Adsense. All over the world, people with little hobby websites were making great money. And interestingly enough, the sites that were text-based–writing!–were doing the best.That was perfect! The only problem? I didn’t have any websites…But, you can’t let the little things keep you down, right?Using Dragon Naturally Speaking (voice recognition software) to navigate the web, I set out to learn everything I could about creating websites, writing content, driving traffic, and optimizing ads. I also delved into the world of affiliate marketing, but I wasn’t much for hardcore selling, so I tended to stick with growing sites I could monetize with Adsense, Chitika, text links, and various other forms of advertising.That first month I made a whopping $2.00.Well, not really, since you have to make at least $100 to get a payout from Adsense.
It is unfortunate that I have no time to take care of them right now.
But I know that soon, I will have time, and I will eventually rare and love one again!
Especially when I move and have my own place! :)
I've been dinging and donging over what kind of dog I want.
I've previously owned a huge and beautiful Golden Retriever, and although he was the bestest dog anyone could ever have, I think now I want to own a smaller sized dog.
I've contemplated miniature poodles. Even miniature schnauzers!
From the pretty to the ugliest! Like pugs or bulldogs :)
The last Sunday, I went out to dinner with my family and I walked past a pet store as I was walking to the bank to get some moolah. I slowed down to see what was inside because the whole place was full and the sounds of baby dogs yelping was too adorable to ignore!
Okay,
So I was walking, right? And my eyes locked on to the most adorablest, most cutestestest, most incredible looking puppy in the world! It was curled up in a sleeping position, but it's little iddy biddy eyes were open, just observing everyone cooing over the other puppies at the place.
I could not, for the life of me, take my eyes off that puppy!!!!
It was just SO CUTE!
SO!
I think I've decided (I say "think" because, admittedly, I've decided on what kind of dog I want before)!
I want.......
I know, I know. It's been about a year since I've last shared "Deep Thoughts by Yours Truly." I find that I am at my best when things are slow and calm. It is typically those times that my little head is able to process and turn events into crazy thoughts in my head. After what seems like a busy and crazy year I've decided to return to the daily grind and be better at updating. These next few entries will catch ya'll up on my life since Wednesday December 17, 2008, but, for now, I wanted to talk about my mid life purgatory.


I don't think I will ever be a person who goes through a midlife crisis. I mean, I strongly believe that having an untraditionally tough childhood has led me to really, really, really appreciate the aging process. My life has increasingly gotten better and more fulfilling with age. But that absolutely does not stop me from having a mid-life purgatory.


For those of you unfamiliar with such above mentioned illness it is when you are literally stuck between being a kid and being an adult. Some people look at this and think...yuck, purgatory stinks while others think its the perfect utopian life balance.


I, on the other-hand, have no idea which one I am. Examples you ask???


1- I walk into the school cafeteria and will shake my head in disgust at all the little children going to school in their pj's BUT find it difficult to leave with my cup of coffee because the TV is tuned into MTV's "True Life"


2. I want to go back to school BUT only if it A.) pays me to study like an adult job does B.) does not require additional work when I am done with class like an adult job does and C.) Gives me 25 vacation days of my choice like my job does (I mean on top of daily classtime)


3. I love hosting dinner parties and throwing keggers and literally having a hoe-down every weekend, BUT the idea of strangers peeing and puking in my sparkly white toilet bowl isn't as glamorous as it was before


4. I attend the "young" events and feel it's too loud, too obnoxious, too hipstery and too, well, young BUT I attend the "adult" events and have a hard time contributing to mortgages, children and climbing the corporate ladder. I mean all I want to do is ask, "Can you believe Tamara in the Real Housewives last night??? I mean, for realz?"


5. I still hate going to bed and will find myself making picture frames, playing Nintendo DS or watching TV til late at night, BUT still getting my purgatory ass out of bed by at least 9 am.


6. On weekends I think about gardening, re-arranging the apartment or running errands BUT typically wake up hung over and wanting a greasy breakfast followed by a nap. (oh p.s. I don't know how to garden, am not too handy when it comes to decorating and really what are errands if not things that can be done tomorrow?)


7. In the sense of cognitive awareness I know that I should be excercising more and eating healthier as I grow older BUT I continue to tell myself that Asians have an additional 5 year bump due to high metabolism and I live in a city that celebrates fine dining so I should never waste such opportunities.


so there you have it dear avid readers. I have now bestowed upon you my deepest and most intimate thoughts. Trust me, more will be coming but, for now, I will leave you with this final thought.


If you find yourself reading this and thinking "yes, yes, yes, I agree" then there is clearly only one solution for you. Move to Brooklyn (preferably as close to Metropolitan and Graham as possible) and let's start a club together where we we act like complete teenage fools with the dignitgy and experience of an adult in purgatory.
Now that I'm selling at three stores and involved in three forums I need to expand my Creative Team. For the most part I'll be selling the same kits at all three stores so creating the LO's is not really an issue. What I'm looking for is are few ladies to help spread the word. I have a lot of events going on at all three stores/forums and my own kit releases, contests, promotions as well.
I am looking for someone to help with advertising, enabling, tweeting, giving RAKS, creating beautiful LO's, and leaving love in my forum galleries!

In return you get full access to all three stores...and full use of any CU products! As well as admission to my private CT threads at my forums. And if I have enough volunteers you get to choose the kits you would like to  work with!
If you are interested email me at aducharme@live.com with a link to your most active gallery, blog, a short bio, and a list of any Creative Teams you are on.

BTW newbies welcome!!!

Good Luck...

This call will be open for a few weeks at least and every email will get a response towards the end of the call.... any help spreading the word of my CT call would be very appreciated!!!
Here's a link to each of my stores so you can have a peek at my products... and what your in for!!
