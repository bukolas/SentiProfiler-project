Mahesh is one of the most sensible guy i've ever met .. He's a very honest and a simple guy . He's passionate bout certain things lik cricket and always has strong views to express .. Brainy guy :) , very studious but has a poor memory .. does anythin for his frnds .. A very outspoken guy and doesn't think about how others may feel bout his views .. His vocab in english is very good and certainly is all set to go to US and pursue his higher education .. I have to mention that he's a very good fielder and has the safest pair of hands :) ... personally i feel its tough to find a guy lik him anywhere els .. nice havin u as a frnd da ..
