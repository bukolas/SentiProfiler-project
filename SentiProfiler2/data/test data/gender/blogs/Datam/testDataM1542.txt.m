Not sure where to start on this one, It moved me and brought me to tears. This young girl, Precious Jones, It starts off with her a 16 year old girl. She has no education, and is very overweight. Wannabe father molesting her, Her mother is a worthless abusive figure in her life that resents her for the father molesting her, and her bearing children of his. Precious is abused and discarded thru her life at home, brought me to tears the things her mother said to her. I can see why Monique won the Oscar, ( she played the mother) It had to been a hard role to act.
