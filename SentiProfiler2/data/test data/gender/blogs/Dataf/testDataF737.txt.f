I really hope that I start to feel better in month 4. Everyone keeps telling me I'll start feeling better soon. Please?! Let it be true! Right now I am so excited that I am going to have a child, but I've hated being pregnant. So I'm really hoping that the 2nd and 3rd trimester will be easier to love being pregnant. I am excited for my baby bump! I want it now :)I started my 'Belly Book' last week and I'm excited to see how this baby grows!
