Today's menu: rotini, meat sauce, green beans, cherry-flavored icee, breadstick, butter, milk. I enjoyed this meal. The pasta and meat sauce weren't bad and I appreciated the variety of rotini (versus spaghetti). I guess the green beans had some kind of butter sauce. I didn't taste a sauce but there was a little buttery residue on the bottom of the paper package. The icee was very sweet. I sucked down a few sips and then stopped. I talked to a couple students about the meal. They said they liked it. I asked if they ate everything and one didn't eat the green beans. Both didn't eat the breadsticks because they were "too busy talking" and ran out of time. In other news I have definitely determined I'm lactose-intolerant this weekend when I ate some ice cream. So I'm no longer going to take a milk when I purchase lunch. I could try and take "lactaid" with me to work, but it's a lot of fuss so I think it's just best if I avoid all milk.
