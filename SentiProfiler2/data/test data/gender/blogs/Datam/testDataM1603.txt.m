Windy here this afternoon; gusts up around thirty-five MPH. Sitting here a bit back staring out my window, sipping a taste of Wild Turkey when I saw a cloud of newspapers sailing by. I ain't talking here about a few, but a goddam blizzard of them.

    I had a flashback to a year or so ago when I looked out there and saw a few thousand plastic grocery store bags flying around, most of which got hung up in my pine trees. Remnants of some of them bags are still hanging around.

    Carrying my glass of Wild Turkey, I strolled down to the road to see what I could see. What I saw was a vortex of newspaper raising from Ms. Graham's backyard and heading my way. I also saw Ms. Graham running around in the road trying to snatch her runaway newspapers out of the air. She wasn't having much luck.

    I like Ms. Graham, seventy-two year old retired school teacher, and subscriber to about nine newspapers, which, after reading, she piles in a stack on her back patio for a year or two.

    I walked on down to her. She was sort of shook up that her stash of  newsprint was blowing off in a N/E direction and getting hung up on mailboxes, power lines, trees and such.

    I suggested to her it was not that big a deal; that newspaper would rot right into the ground pretty soon.

     "Besides," I told her, "if I run out of toilet paper any time soon, I'll just go out and pluck some off my trees."

     You might think a seventy-two year retired school teacher wouldn't find that funny.

     You'd be wrong.
