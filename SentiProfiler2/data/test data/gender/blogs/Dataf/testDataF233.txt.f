About 6 months ago, I had a severe acute asthma attack and was hospitalised for 10 days, requiring IV theophylline and oral steroids. I was on steroids for about six weeks, at about 40mg a day. Before I went into hospital, I was 10 stone 6lbs but after, was 12 stone!!!! (I am 5ft 8). My exercise levels dipped for a few mnths - it took ages to get back on track. Prior to the attack, I was walking abt 12000 steps a day & doing some exercise (about 3 x 30 mins a wk). I am not a big fan of running or heavy cardio, as it makes me breathless which can make me panic. I walk briskly (4 - 4.5 mph). Currently I'm also hoola hooping about 4 times a week for 30 - 45 mins with a DVD which really causes me to sweat! However, the weight loss is SLOW. I only started seriously in Jan and now go up and down between 11st 4 and 11st 6. I am SO careful with what I eat - lots of wholegrains, fruit and veg, lower fat meat etc but it just won't shift. It is making me miserable. Help please! PS yes, I probably did eat more than usual (increased appetite is a side effect of oral steroids) and as I've said, I also reduced my regular exercise as I was unwell. Calories in up, calories out down = weight gain. I'm not stupid. I'm not interested in discussing HOW I gained the weight, I'm interested in HOW I can get rid of it, given that I now walk 3 - 4 miles a day and eat 1500 calories a day? Also, to be fair, as I slept for most of the time I was off ill, I can't see how I would have gained 21 - 22lbs in six weeks as this would entail increased consumption of 1833 calories a day in addition to what I needed anyway?
