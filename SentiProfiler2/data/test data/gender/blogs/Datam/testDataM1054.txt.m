So I haven't been eating or sleeping much lately, since my anxiety and my depression been bad I just haven't been able to do those two things and I'm worried because people told me I look much more pale and skinnier, which you would think me being sober would do the complete opposite, I know things will get better it's just hard doing it by myself no matter how many times people say other wise I'm basically alone with my extreme problems, it's cool though because in some weird way I know I deserve to feel this way.

It sucks big time because I'm a little lonely but it's cool I can deal with it I just need to keep school a top priority So I can start my new life.

The only real thing keeping me here would be my goals because they are keeping me positive. Also I find it hard not to result to old ways since I'm so depressed but I have been clean and sober which is good I just look at this time as Gods way to show me that I need alternative methods of being happy with me.. I know I'll be ok but I just need people rooting for me..... Also in the pic below it's a new sleep tracker app I got and lol last night was the most I had in forever lol I will post more of these because they are mad interesting but hey take a look!!
