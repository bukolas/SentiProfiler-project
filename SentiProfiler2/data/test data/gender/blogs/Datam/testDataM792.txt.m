If the weather this weekend has been anything like here then you too are enjoying rain.  I'm diligently keeping an eye on my extremely religious neighbors backyard for signs the early stages of ark building or animal collecting.  So far nothing but the usual year-round live nativity. The one advantage of Daylight Savings returning over it leaving is the fact that resetting clocks like my alarm clock are easier when all you are doing is moving one hour ahead.
