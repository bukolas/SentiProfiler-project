Some rooms were empty of souls. They held apparatus, desks and chairs, straps. Organized neatly and forgotten this was where monsters were born. In those rooms, those forgotten rooms, the men and women of the crisp uniforms slated their lust on one another gutting their appetites salaciously. They gave no care to vow or matrimony worshipping their flesh on the altar of their uniforms. Bent lines and grinning death’s heads, blood and silver shining brightly on the horizon of arm bands and lapels. Superiors turned a blind eye to these diversions.

Outside, passing these pores, down the flanks and near the edge of the building’s furthest corner two soldiers hovered over their cigarettes. Smoke hung like great thoughts of suicide.

“I hear rumors,” one soldier said to the other. “Some are saying you have a whore locked away for your personal use.”

The other pulled a long glowing drag from his cigarette. Smoke tumbled from his nose and he breathed out fumes from casually pursed lips.

“What of it?” he asked dismissively not looking at the other. “These are rumors. So what?” he said with a shrug.

The other leaned in close. “You know it is against the law to bed these filthy animals! You know a child produced this way would only be partially human! Can you imagine?”

He pulled again on his cigarette, heard paper crumble into smoke under his inhalation.
