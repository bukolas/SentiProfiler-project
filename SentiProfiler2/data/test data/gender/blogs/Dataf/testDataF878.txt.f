I began this new decade with a three day cleansing fast of just water and tea. I used to fast regularly and was always amazed at how full I could feel from being empty.

I used to suffer from immobilizing panic attacks. In retrospect, most of them were due to alcohol and/or xanax withdrawal, both of which I abused for most of my life, but I still sometimes get them. I haven't had one panic attack in three weeks, in spite of some heavy duty real life challenges.

I think it is because the fast, as short as it was, put things in perspective. On the second day I was miserable and my ego was screaming at me to stop it.
