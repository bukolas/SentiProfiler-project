Excellent post brother Abu Fatima, and thanks a lot for the info. In september 2008,the forums published a list of at least 60 murtad sahwa leaders already eliminated by then. I came to know this from an Asia Times article of November 2008,which was perhaps the first mainstream news article that could see the return of the mujahideen,especially the Islamic State mujahideen. IF ANY BROTHER OR SISTER CAN REPOST THAT INFORMATION ON THIS FORUM ,IN THIS THREAD NOW,IT WOULD BE GREAT.IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW THE PILLARS OF APOSTASY THAT WERE DESTROYED ,TO PAVE THE RETURN OF THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ. Also, brother Abu fatima ,are you sure that murtad colonel riyadh al sammerai is dead ? He was a media savvy idiot,as I recall his name from some earlier news reports. I think this idiot was a police colonel. I would be glad if he is actually dead.
