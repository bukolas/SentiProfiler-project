Reuters A suicide bomber killed two people outside a major NATO military base in southern Afghanistan on Monday, officials said, as U.S. Marines pushed on with a major new offensive and sporadic violence flared across the country. The bomber drove a car packed with explosives toward a line of truck drivers waiting to supply foreign troops at the Kandahar air field, a major base for international troops in a province long considered the heartland of the Taliban insurgency. Kandahar is also adjacent to Helmand province, where thousands of Marines launched a big new assault last week to wrest the initiative away from the Taliban in a province which also supplies most of the opium poppy that funds the insurgency.
