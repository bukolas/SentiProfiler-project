..The republicans are the only thing standing between Obama and a socialist 3rd world America. The health care bill is a fiscal nightmare and bodes ill for seniors. The majority of Americans don't want it else it would have already made it through; it is the die hard loyalist to Obama who cling tenaciously to a bad idea and are unwilling to let it go.
Michelle I am heartened by the progress you have revealed your sister has shown. I believe eventually you will find a way to get help for your sister. If you were in Canada or England with their socialized programs you definitely would not have a shot and would be trying to figure out how to get to America to maybe have a shot.
If that bill gets through, opportunities for resolution of complicated issues like yours will be impossible to resolve.
