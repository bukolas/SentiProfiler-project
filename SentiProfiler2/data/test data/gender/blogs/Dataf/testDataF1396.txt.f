SO I TOTALLY DID THE PRESCRIBED WEIGHT FOR WOMEN OF 95#s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am really proud of me. Like really, really really. It was tough. By round 5 I was mentally drained; I couldn't believe that I had 5 more rounds to do. What did I eat today? Not much.
I had Scrambled eggs with Parmesan cheese, bacon, and basil.
A decaf latte.
