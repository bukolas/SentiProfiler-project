Last night, Sofia and I saw The Lightning Thief at midnight. For those who don't know, this movie is based on the book of the same name, about a character named Percy Jackson who learns that he is a demigod: half human, half Greek god. Sofia has loved the series of books for nearly five years. If you remember back to my blog last summer, I waited in line for two hours to get the author's autograph, since Sofia was in Costa Rica. She's crazy for the books.

So it was only fitting that we go see the movie as soon as any non-theater employee/industry insider possibly could.

Sofia didn't have school Friday, but I did. So I purposefully fell asleep when I lay down with Bella and Alex, and then woke up around 10:30 to get ready to go. Sofia also took a bit of a nap.

We dressed, drove to the theater, got our popcorn and drinks, and found the perfect seat. The showing wasn't a sell-out, but it was pretty full.

So now, for those interested, I present my review of The Lightning Thief. I'm always sensitive to spoilers, so when I get into spoiler territory, I'll change the color to almost match the background. If you don't want to read it, just skip it. But if you want to read them, click and drag your mouse across them and read them while they're highlighted.

I haven't read a single review of the film yet, so I want to get my two cents posted before I check out what the critics are saying. I've read all the books, so my opinion will obviously be flavored with that perspective, but I'm not one of those people who hates when movies change the storyline or details. I know adapting a book to a movie is a bit of an art form in and of itself. I'm cool with that, as long as it's done well.
