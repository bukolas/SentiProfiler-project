According to the calendar, winter is officially upon us. It began last week and will be with us for the next three months â€“ Ugh! The arrival of Ole Man Winter is a bitter/sweet for me; more bitter than sweet. While I appreciate the beauty of a fresh, crisp snowfall, I do not welcome the cold. As I sit here by the fire, typing this blog, the snow is falling outside of my windows. It began a short while ago. The large flakes have already created a white blanket completely covering the ground and the trees are outlined with snow on every branch. It is absolutely gorgeous! It is picture perfect scenery that I will enjoy for about two weeks. Then I want it to be warm again. The winter season confines me and limits my activities more than any other time of the year. It is the season that reminds me of the things I cannot do rather than the things I can do. Arthritis alone limits mobility, making every task a challenge. But when joint replacements, fusions and reconstructed limbs are factored in, the challenges increase. Having limited range of motion, decreased strength and the need for adaptive equipment makes the equation even more complicated. Then add icy, slippery conditions, and the combination becomes high risk.
