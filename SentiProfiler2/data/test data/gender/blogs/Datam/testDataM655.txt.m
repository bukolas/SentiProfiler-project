Class 12 is a pivotal point in any student's life.It is the stage where one has to prove himself so that he has a good future in his hands.If he fails there ,then he may have to work hard in his college days so that he can live his better part of life happily.And it was no different for me.
I had secured 85% in my class 10 examinations at the CBSE level and my mother had asked me to take biology group so that i can appear for both medical and engineering entrance examinations.At this point i would like to confess that until 12 Th standard i didn't know what is the difference between an engineering and Arts college.I thought Madras Christian college was a good college and more over an engineering college at the end of my 11 th standard and i was praying i should get a seat there. Since i was living in town there were no great coaching centers like iipe and aspire in our area and the only center known around Tambaram was Arul institute and i enrolled there in 11th itself because a rumour was spreading that they won't take in much students 12th and only those who had enrolled in 11th will get a seat there.
The class 11 was happily passing by and i was just beginning to know every problem by heart in my maths book so that even though i dunno the formula i would solve the problem easily because that was my strength of memory those times. I cleared class 11 with a percentage of 90 and was looking forward to 12th and the tuition in arul institute had begun in late may itself and i along with three friends Bharath,Prasanna and Aravind would go together for the tuition.
