So....I still come around here once in a while.  I read a blog or two.  I rarely leave comments anymore.  It's because I am real busy and self-important, dontchya know!

I have just been swimming in busy'ness. Treading may be more accurate.  OK....swimming sounds like I'm going somewhere.  Treading might not be progressive, but still sounds athletic.  I guess bobbing in busy'ness would be more apt.

My job has taken over my life.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my job.  Egotistically, I even sometimes think I'm kinda good at it.  I didn't acknowledge it (I think I realized it a while ago) until tonight.

I read Misha's blog about her daughter and her sense of wonderment.  It made me smile.  I remember some of the conversations that I have had with Misha and some of the blogs those conversations birthed.  I look back, and compared to now, my life was shit.  We talked about bridges, and love, and Terebithia and I wrote about Hank and Phil, and HER and kicking dirt with my bare feet, and about boobs and poop and such.

I guess I post blogs when I need the catharsis of producing a gigantic mass of emotion, turmoil, angst, wonderment, joy, anger and the like.  I felt that urge tonight....then the kids started fighting.....and all that I could produce was a proverbial wet fart.

Today, as I said, life is busy, and from other's expectations good.  There are the daily grind headaches.  And no time for the heartaches.  I kinda miss the heartaches, and the wonderment that they brought.

This made no sense whatsoever......

Anyway.....have a good night.  The headaches come early when they start at 530....

Later
