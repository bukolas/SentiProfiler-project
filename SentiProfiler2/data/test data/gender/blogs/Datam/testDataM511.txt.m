Along with abuse, it is also important to recognise if your relationship is not only making you miserable, but is also robbing your self esteem. When you realize that the effects of your relationship are preventing you from enjoying life, it is time to step back and re-evaluate your relationship. Of course no relationship is perfect and you can expect to have good and bad times, but if things have become so negative that you no longer feel good about yourself, then the relationship is destructive and needs to end.
