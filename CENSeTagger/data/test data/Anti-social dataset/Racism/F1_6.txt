If a black person has pride in his race. "Good for them" everyone says, but if a white person has pride, its "damn racists." I dont like to admit it, but i have a little mexican in me. I know people are going to say, "he cant be white power, hes a little mexican." I dont care. If I could find out which part of my body had the most berder-hopper in it, i'd cut it off.

Black people whine about every little thing. "my great grandpa was a slave, please feel pity for me." And when there is a white state governor they try to help blacks, white, mexicans and everyother immigrant race, but when there is a black person with a little power what do they do? they do all they can to help THEIR precious race and no one elses.

I dont see a WHITE HISTORY MONTH! What dumb-ass let whoever take away Columbus Day and give us Martin Luther King day? I was watching TV the other day and guess what I saw? A show called THE BLACK FORUM. Where 3 niggers discuss problems in the black community! What the hell is that about?? What do you think would happen if some white guy started THE WHITE FORUM? His ass would be off the air so damn fast and you know it. Why is it that when you see a TV show about a white family there always has to be at least one black person or other race somewhere in the show? but when theres a show about a black family, THEYRE ALL BLACK! It's total bullshit. We have to get treated like shit in our own country.

Could you please post me on "the most offensive letters" page? I want to know who else cant stand putting up with this shit.

Thank you

Robby
