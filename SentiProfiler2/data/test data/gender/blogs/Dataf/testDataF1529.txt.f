I just love and cherish the place where I was born because I am a friend, cousin, niece and granddaughter of people who reside in Israel. I also happen to LOVE the scenery, food, and environment of my homeland.
Fine, so I lied a bit. I would hate to see Israel non-existent or unrecognized. Which definitely means I am NOT anti-Israel. I'm also pro-peace. Glad we got that out of the way...

A little history on how I got into this whole pro-Israel mess:
I was born in Rishon Le-Tzion, Israel. I lived there until I was eight, except for a brief year when my parents decided to venture off to Hong Kong and get all these stamps on my passport from all of Eastern Asia. Too bad all I have is the passport...
I moved to the Silicon Valley where I only started to value and recognize my Israeli identity in high school.
I got really involved in a youth group called Tzofim, and dreamed of joining the Israel Defense Forces after high school as early as freshman year.
I spent every summer vacation in Israel during my high school years. Summers were all I looked forward to.
Did I mention the Silicon Valley has a huge Israeli community? Well this was a huge factor for my ability to stay connected to my culture instead of diving into the big melting pot of american society.

Well as it turns out, there aren't many Israelis in San Diego, where I go to school. Thus, when looking to get involved with the Israeli community at UCSD, I was right away pointed to the direction of Israel advocacy. This is where this whole pro/anti thing comes in. Israel advocacy is basically feeding everyone and their mom the greatness of Israel through it's diversity, innovations, and did I mention- it is the only democracy in the middle east? It's making sure Jews are pro-Israel and non-Jews are simply not anti. Sometimes, I feel as if it one big brainwash. But I live for it.

So.
I'm going to Israel this summer simply to enjoy every beautiful (and humid) moment.
