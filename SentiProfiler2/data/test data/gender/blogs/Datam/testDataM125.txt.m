    * Did actress Rebecca Hall break up Kate Winslet's marriage to Sam Mendes? Sources can't agree. One says, "When Kate found out that Sam had grown close to Rebecca she was upset. Rebecca is totally Sam's type - a thespian mix of brains and beauty," but another insists, "Sam and Rebecca are good friends, of course they are, they have spent the better part of a year working together on the Bridge Project. But to insinuate that there is anything further in the friendship is taking it too far." [Daily Mail]
