last week i got a letter back from the wisconsin review. they turned down my 2 poems i sent them. that's fine. you can't win them all. the poems really go together and i think they deserve to get published, so i'll just send them to another place. if you can't take rejection don't go into the publishing buisness. publishing of any kind, music, book, movies, etc.
