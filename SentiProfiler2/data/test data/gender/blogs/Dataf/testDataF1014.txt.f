I woke up today and got on with my morning rituals – checked my Gmail, Facebook, and listened to some feel-good songs on Youtube. Then I logged on to Google Talk after quite a few weeks to update myself on my friends’ statuses, their profile pictures, etc. It gave me a fair clue of how they were doing. I came to Facebook again. But this time around, I found too much information about the same people – what they like, which groups and activities they are a part of, which games they play, where they have been traveling, whom they have been hanging out with, bla bla – and all this confused me. Trust me, a year back, I kinda used to dislike Google chatting, since it prevented me from thinking about what I was saying. I preferred snail emailing to chatting as it was more static and easier to handle. And today, I find myself preferring Gtalk to Facebook. Why? Simply because Gtalk is not a social networking site where I have to keep projecting an image of my Self. Gtalk is a directed, simple two-dimensional medium wherein I can have a one-on-one conversation with a person I am actually interested to talk to and know about. Wow! Now all of a sudden this has become a privilege, thanks to Facebook and twitter. Suddenly, I feel relieved that I have some real people who are not too addicted to Facebook, and who are not looking at my “information” to know me, but are going beyond it to spend real time with me outside these news updates. And hey, I honestly feel this change happened in just the past one year, when all of us got overly addicted to Facebook. Social Networking with people who live in the same city and area as you – Quite a bad idea. I am very much for picking up my landline,calling up my friend and catching up especially when I live in the same country as him/her, and where local rates are the same as internet costs. I want something real dude – like a human voice maybe? And not a profile picture to connect to a person. Eeks. Creeps me out.  I think its high time someone started a Facebook Regulatory Board – on what can be done and what can’t be done on Facebook. It is such a mess otherwise. And NO. Privacy settings hardly matter and hardly help. Well yes, I do hear some of your counter arguments btw – That Facebook helps me market my events, it helps me connect to older school buddies, it obliviates hierarchies and protocols between people. Hmm…. Alright..  I can accept that to an extent. But whatever happened to respecting privacy? And its not even about others’ privacy here. Respecting your own privacy – what happened to that? Its lost. Gone. I find a lot of people not caring or thinking about what they put up on Facebook, I find myself in that situation too, mainly because Facebook started as a Fun, light-hearted means to pass time. Suddenly you wake up to the fact that its a lot more of a serious affair. Highly unsettling. Anyway.. Being the optimist that I am and desperate to conclude things on a good note like Bollywood movies, I do accept that dear old facebook can be positive at times, which is why I have still not terminated my account there. For instance, there was almost a virtual, spontaneous school reunion –  thanks to an old class photo which someone posted (it happened a few days back and delighted me  ). Everyone started commenting, feeling nostalgic about old teachers and old life, thanks to this photo - as high as 120 comments in a day!! Or a friend who was able to get in touch with me when she really needed my help, but was in some remote part of the world and had lost my mail. Now that – is truly awesome!
