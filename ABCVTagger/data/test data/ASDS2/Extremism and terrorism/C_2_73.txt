those losers who go to kuffar to improve their sorry lives and forget about Allah are in plain error today we see muslims selling their religion for a couple of dollars.....people going to magicians to improve their sorry lives because they dont have trust in Allah....and even muslim leaders selling their own brothers and sisters to kuffar elite for a couple of dollars many people forget about Allah and go to others (kuffar)...thinking...they are the ones who can benefit them... .have they forgotten about Allah? the Bountiful.....have they forgotten about asking Allah Azzawajal to provide for them...isnt it Allah azzawajal who provide for every living thing in the heavens and earth.?.....so why turn your back on Allah and rely on kuffar? ...why not rely on Allah alone and ask Him?....and have trust in Allah And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah, if Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or if He willed some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy? Say: Allah is my all. In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust. "Whatever of Mercy (i.e. of good), Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." (Qur'an, 35:2) "If Allah touches you with hurt, there is none can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is one who can repel His favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (Qur'an, 10:117) "If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you. And in Allah (alone) let believers put their trust." (Qur'an, 3:160) "And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine." (Qur'an, 65:2-3)
