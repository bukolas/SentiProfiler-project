I have a child who is thirteen who has sensory intergration disorder and nnon verbal learnign disorder one of the most difficulty I am having istelling when she is sick. For example recently she got a double ear infection. I did not know until she had a 101 fever and was vomitting. she also does not relize when she is hurt. I have had to home school her because she is considered difficult to teach. Some teachers ask if I have had her tested for adhd and if so why have I not giving her medication. I provide documents on her condition and it does not seem to help.
