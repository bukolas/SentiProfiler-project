I’m still writing with my lucky pen.

It’s been broken in half for a long time now but the ink still makes words.

The words sometimes cheer or bring despair; sometimes the rant gets caught in my facial hair.

There're holes in my boots and there's holes in my life but that just lets out the shit.

I’ve yet to see a wise man stand in my shoes, and see the light of day from my point of view, but perhaps I’m just not wise or I’ve soap in my eyes.

I try to keep away from the things I despise but they just follow my feet like I was so much fresh shit and they’re so many flies.
