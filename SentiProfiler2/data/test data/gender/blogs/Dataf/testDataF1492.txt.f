OK, How many of you like to receive a nice letter in the mail from a friend?  I know I do.  Even though most of the time I get the mail from the mailbox it is junk mail, I still enjoy the wonder of "will there be a letter?"  On small occasions there is a letter that you open and savor.  A nice card from a friend far away with actual hand written words, possibly in a colorful pen.  You read it once, you read it twice, you may read it everyday for a week or longer.  It inspires you to write one back and maybe even write a letter to a different friend.  In this technological world we all email, face book, blog, etc..... and don't get me wrong I love them all, but what has happening to letter writing.  We say we have no time, but really how many hours do we spend on the computer blogging or facebooking. So why has this art form lost its value?  It has lost its value so much that post offices are closing.  Mail delivery may be shortened by a day.

I had the wonderful opportunity to live on Martha's Vineyard for a period of my life . During that time I was an avid letter writer.  Nothing like living on a New England Island in winter to motivate letter writing.  There was this wonderful little store in Vineyard Haven, called Paper Tiger.  It was filled with uniques cards, papers,pens, stamps and stationary sets.  I would walk into town and peruse the store for hours picking out just the right cards for people and write letters.  I think I will make someone happy this week and write them a letter and in the mean time support the postal service.  Just think what would happen if it closed.  Many books and history have been written and recorded through letters.  Let's keep our history going!   Happy writing.
