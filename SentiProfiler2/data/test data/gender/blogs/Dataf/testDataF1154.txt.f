Showing Improvement Well, I've been on the antibiotics and other meds that my Gastro put me on for over a week now, and I'm beginning to see progress. I still have problems with my tummy, but the constant feeling of nausea is gone ... and good riddance! We wrapped all the presents and filled the stockings last night, so we're all ready to enjoy the next few days with our family. We'll all be together this Christmas, and that always makes it extra special. Some years we have to share our daughter with her in-laws, which is only fair, but I'm glad she and her hubby will be celebrating with us this year. We've had a particularly rewarding Christmas this year already, helping a large number of families find replacements for lost or bedraggled lovies for Santa to put under their Christmas trees! We've received wonderfully excited thank you's from many of them, and each time one was received it just made this Christmas that much more meaningful. It can't be said often enough that it really is more enjoyable to give than to receive!! My hope and prayer is that you have a Christ filled Christmas this year, too!
