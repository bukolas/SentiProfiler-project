'    I can feel comfortable about the fact that I have a nice room, nice roommate, meals, education, friends and especially a car, but I do not take joy in the fact that the school that I have chosen to spend 4 years in contains bigotry. I should have expected this in the south, but I had hoped things changed. They didn\'t.  Sometimes, many times, it hurts. I mean, it really hurts. It\'s like I\'m not a part of this society, this world here at SMU. Whenever I meet a new person, I often think to myself, \"Is this person bigoted?\" Or, whenever I contemplate upon asking a girl out on a date I wonder, \"would she like to go out with me, a black man!\"  At home, none of these thoughts took place.  It\'s worse with the girls than the boys here, because the girls will be nice to me, but if the thought of dating pops up, it\'s a different story. It frustrates me that people don\'t look at the inside of a person more than the outside, for it\'s the inside that counts. Also, why wouldn\'t a black man be just as good as a white man for dating! I never thought about these things in the Chicago area, and I mean never!  One example of what I can only conclude to be bigotry is my interest in a girl here. I don\'t want to reveral her name, so I\'ll call her Nora. Nora and I met 2 months ago at Morrison\'s crash party. A friend of mine (a girl from the Chicago area) introduced her to me. When I first saw her, I really became interested in her. I also thought she liked me because we talked for awhile. Since then, I have talked to her many times on the telephone, and it seemed like a relationship evolved. Then I asked her out to a movie, but she said, \"No, I have a lot of homework tonight.\" I asked her to the Eddie Murphy concert a week before it opened, and she said that she would love to go. Then, the night before the concert, she calls me up and says that she can\'t come because her boyfriend (I did know that she had a boyfriend) just called her and was going to visit her the same night of the concert. It hurt. So, I took a friend of mine (female) to the concert, and it was fun. However, I still wondered how it was quite a coincidence that Nora\'s boyfriend was coming into town the same night. Was it a lie? I asked Nora\'s friends, and they said that her boyfriend was with her that night. They might have covered for her though.  I then decided to ask her out a few more times. However, it seemed that this time, whenever I called her for a date, she was always going out with someone else. I knew two of those guys, who were caucasian, and I found it strange that she found time for them and not me. (continued tomorrow.)    I knew that \"Nora\" liked someone, but she dated other guys as well, white / caucasion guys. She never gave me a chance. I often wonder, is she bigoted or does she just see me as a friend, or what? Bigotry has been popping in my mind quite a bit, however.  Why is it that the college that I chose to go to, to spend 4 plus years of my life, bigoted? I did not come here by scholarship, or through any minority program, I came here because my family can afford it, and because I wanted to go here. I especially came here because the SMU administration thought I had a chance here. Why did they paint a false picture? Why am I going through this torture of racial prejudice?  Back home, this thought of racism hardly ever occured to me, maybe that\'s the reason why I\'m here, to realize the presence of it. Now that I really know that racism still exists in the 80\'s, I am hurt because i feel that I may have a foot in the door in today\'s society, but the world will always slam it (the door). My father, had a foot in the door, and eventually opened it to become the first black man to be first in line to be Chief Executive Officer of a Fortune 500 company. Not many people know that, because he is very humble, and doesn\'t want or need any publicity. I respect that in him, because he doesn\'t let his head get \"too big,\" or my head, or my family\'s heads as well. He tells me not to worry about bigotry, because it won\'t go away any time soon. He also tells me that I am just as good as anyone else, and that no one should tell me otherwise.  What makes people think that they are better than someone else because of their race, or any other aspect? My feelings about this are sadness, disgust, and anger. Sometimes I just want to hit someone or something, or scream, in order to release my frustation. But no matter how hard I may pound my fists, or grit my teeth, the situation will not change. I just have to trust God in order for me to get through this, and hope that He will find an answer.  The reason why this topic has been so fundemental is because it shatters my perfect image of college. I thought I could really be a part of the university, and of the people. But to the Southerners, I\'m just an ink spot on a white piece of paper. When I chose SMU, I felt confident, I felt great!  But now that I\'ve experienced SMU life, I feel a little insecure. I may have made a lot of friends here, but I may never really be a part of them, just because of the color of our skin, and that saddens me.    I knew that \"Nora\" liked someone, but she dated other guys as well, white / caucasion guys.

One thing that has really concerned me greatly during my few months here is the subject of bigotry.  I am from the Chicago area, and I was pretty comfortable there.  I went to a small private school (my senior class had only 45 students) and had made many good friends!  Racial prejudice was never evident in my school, and that made me feel good, because I am black.  If there was any sort of racial prejudice present, it must have been subtle, because I couldn\'t detect any sort of bigotry among the many friends I made in my former school.  I was very well known at this school.  One reason was that I have been at that school since 6th grade (it was a kg - 12 grade school), and I sang and acted in high school.  Because of these things and the size of my school I just about knew everybody.  I had made some very strong ties with some people, and I will always try to uphold them.  Unfortunately, I never dated in high school.  At first I thought the reason was that I was ugly, and that no girl would ever want to go out with me.  But then I realized that the reason why I didn\'t date was that most, if not all of the girls that I knew were good friends.  I didn\'t go out with them because it wouldn\'t seem right.  I made attempts to date some of those friends, but I failed.  I never got a chance to meet girls from other schools because I hung out with my group from my school, and we did many things together.  I felt very welcome, happy, and comfortable with that group, and I try to keep in touch with them, whenever I can.  When I got out of elementary school, my parents had to make a decision.  The decision was whether they should send me to a big public school and have a good social life, or to send me to a small private school and have a good education.  Although both factors were important, my parents voted for the education, because a good education can get me somewhere.  Although at times I have regretted this decision, it all worked out for the best.  Now comes SMU, with some happy stories and bad stories.  SMU at first seemed to welcome me,  make me a part of it.  People were friendly and kind, and I felt good.  I have made a lot of friends, and I know quite a great deal of people.  However, then came the big slap in my face, I was told that there was almost no interracial dating down here at all.  My sense of security almost completely vanished, I was shocked, it was like, again, a slap in the face.  In the Chicago area, interracial dating happened all the time.  No one seemed to mind.  It happened in my school and other schools.  So already I had stamped in my mind that interracial dating is fine anywhere.  Then I come down to Dallas, and an awful picture is painted before me.

'    Why am I here at SMU? Why do I study? These aren\'t your questions (necessarily), but they are mine.  I like things that satisfy me. I like a good meal, getting drunk, and most of all, being successful. College is definitely a step towards success. That is success in college is vital for success in life.  My two biggest fears are growing up and growing up and not being able to support my family. What an awful experience it would be to watch your undernourished child come closer to death everyday.  I don\'t want the world just a place in it. Hell, if I had the world I would probably give it away, very carefully of course.  My best friend, Steve, is fucking up. He goes to a huge state school in his home town, never studies, maintains a \"C\" average (very easy to do where he attends), and never thinks about the rest of his life. Which will start for me right after my MBA, about 4 1/2 years unless I also start to fuck up.  I guess it is fear of being a fuck up that causes me to drive hard here at school. Attending college wasn\'t really a choice, succeeding was.  I am happy at college. Not because I like it, but because I like doing well and since I am doing well, I like being here. I\'m sure I would hate it if I were failing. I was failing in Jr High. I HATED JUNIOR HIGH!  I suppose this all ties into my outlook of life and the way I judge other people. Life doesn\'t start until happiness starts. For me happiness is success. So why don\'t my friends start life and work at succeeding at something? I do not want them to wish they had started trying earlier a couple of years from now. I would say something, but that would show some arrogance to do. I guess I am and do things the way I do because I\'m afraid of falling to the side of the road as my friends and others around me seem to be doing. Maybe my early success at selling on commission and independence at home helped me get things set straight early. I don\'t know, but I wish it would happen for Steve as well.    I\'m writing about college again. What do I miss? What is important to me? How are things without them? Is my independence good? Is it new?  I\'m becoming claustrophobic living on campus. I only see a limited number of settings in my day and I\'m getting tired of them. People are fine, for the most part, but I wish I could get out more.  The independence I\'ve taken on here has been no big deal at all. My parents divorced early and my mom had to go back to school and eventually started working. I took on virtually all the father\'s household tasks such as mowing the lawn and changing the oil. Later, at age 17, I landed a high paying job, thus I always took care of myself financially. In fact, in a financial way, I\'m more dependent now. I don\'t like that.  I feel that if I were less shy I could accomplish a lot more socially. I was the fattest child in grade school and as a result every day I was ridiculed and humbled to the point of tears. I avoided people because the term \"fat Matt\" would always enter any conversation.  After I lost the weight I was happier, but still, to this day, I have little confidence in my appearance. In fact, that is one more thing that has been challenging for me. Everyone here seems to be so attractive and worried about the way their friends look and the cars they drive. I hope it doesn\'t wear off on me. One more stuck-up person is not what this campus needs.  Surprisingly, my complaints seem to be from more of the social scene than the academic scene. Which is more important anyway? I know the answer, but if college is said to be some of the best times of our life, then I want to make them great. I have had a great time. Probably because I have started to take my roommate\'s advice on what other people think, \"Fuck \'em,\" or nicely put, \"who cares what they think, who are they anyway to make that judgement about me? Are they better?\" I used to think yes, but now I know the answer. Not necessarily.   College, a lot better education, a better life.  My father always assumed I would attend college, as did I, I suppose. I was excited to come, however my father instilled a fear in me greater than I have ever felt. In a very round-about way he said he was spending thousands on my education and I had better not fuck up. It was everyone\'s anticipation that I would fail. Now that I have proved them wrong I\'m searching for reasons to bust my ass next semester. NOw everyone knows I can succeed.  One thing I do miss being at college is a friend. I had a best friend at home, but we stopped hanging out about three months prior to my leaving. I didn\'t think much of it, I figured someone else would take his place. No one did. I find myself mad at him because he isn\'t a good friend anymore. I want to make someone I can pal around with. I\'m so picky, even though I wouldn`t ever say anything. Many of my friends here have things about them that drive me up walls. I\'m sure I\'d like the guys here a lot more if I saw them less. In the dorm living with the same 40 guys can be quite stressful.  At first I was going to be a \"loner\". I wanted to wake up, study, and sleep, not get close with someone and not let anyone get close to me. I was surprised at how much I wanted friends. I saw all my old friends this weekend and am looking forward to seeing them again in 2 1/2 weeks. \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\" That quote from who knows who is truer than I knew.  My parents have been really cool while I\'ve been here. My father nags, but not to the point I dislike him for it. It helps me considerably knowing he will be disappointed in me if I fail. I guess that can be my motivation for next semester. He bribed me to do well with a car. I performed, but I don\'t want his money. I\'ve considered ROTC. My father has plenty of money, but I want to say when I\'m done, \"I did it all by my fucking self!\" Not to him or anyone else, just to me. Then I would have a feeling of self worth.     Why am I here at SMU? Why do I study?

'    I would describe my first semester at college as a time of stress. I like being away from home. This makes me feel free. However, I seem to have no organization in my life, although I am learning slowly. I can not handle schedules. They make me feel pressured. My free time at college escapes me every day. I waste time a lot and it leaves me feeling empty. I like to set goals, but I hate following structured plans. When I am organized, I feel good, like I have accomplished something. When I skip class, I feel guilty and don\'t like myself. My biggest change is from a structured, sheltered life to a free, but often stressful life. I get stressed because I don\'t handle my free hours very well. I need someone or something to push me, but I hate being pushed. When I am forced, I feel cornered and self-conscious. I hate feeling self-conscious. I want to be myself, but I can\'t find myself. I act differently all the time, depending on where I am. I thought that I would discover myself at college, but i haven\'t so far and I am stressed and frustrated. I want to accomplish something, but I don\'t know how to, What am I really good at? I know that I am good at soccer, but with school I can\'t concentrate completely on my athletics. This is what I hate about college. I wish that I could play soccer all the time. I feel free when I am playing. I always thought that I was smart, but I\'ve found that I am not in college. If I was organized, I would be smart. My lack of organization and structure in my life makes me feel less like a real person. I wish that I could get good grades as I did in grade school. It was easy then. Life at college is too complicated. It confuses me. I don\'t know when to be happy or depressed. I always feel unprepared. It seems as though everyone else is always prepared.     I feel frustrated that I have let things get so out of hand. After starting out with good intentions, I sortof blew it. I am relieved that this semester is almost over. I hope to do better next semester. It\'s hard getting to all of my classes now. I don\'t always like to go. I have a very vegatime attitude towards class. Sometimes I hate class because I always feel less prepared than anyone else. I wish that I was on top of things. I don\'t like school right now. I want to start over. I like being here and the people that I know, but I hate class and work (homework). I want to be liked and popular and I am. However, I feel that if I say no to someone, they won\'t like me as much. I look back with frustration and anger at what I have accomplished. Why couldn\'t I have been spectacular in everything I did first semester in college? I am also relieved that these troubles are almost over. I want to get out of my dorm. I feel trapped there and it is sometimes hard to study. Next year, I want to live in an apartment. When you live in a dorm all the time, everything is school, school, school. I want to be away from school except during the day when I have class. If I get an apartment, I will be able to focus everything better. I don\'t feel like studying when I\'m stuck at school all day and night, every day. That\'s probably why I feel trapped and go out so much. I don\'t mind being away from my friends from home and my family for so long. I want to be out on my own. Sometimes I wish my parents or somebody was here to push me and get me motivated. In the future I want to be more self-motivated, even though it is so hard to accomplish this. I want to find out who I really am. Am I really shy and reserved as people tell me all the time? I hate when people are shocked when I talk. I don\'t feel like talking all the time. I think people are turned off by my quietness and they don\'t like to talk to me. I\'m not trying to be mean. I wish that I had more to say. I wish that I was more outgoing.     I feel so much different now than at any other time in my life. One can not come into college with preconceived notions and expect them to all come true. I came to college expecting to be organized and ready to study. I also expected to do well in soccer. Now I find myself under a lot of stress. I want to do so well, but I don\'t want to take the time to achieve my best. Instead of studying or resting up for a game the next day, I waste time with my friends or girlfriend doing things that are more fun. I feel abandoned by my will power and goals. Why can\'t I get into a normal living pattern? My parents have not let me discover the hard way what it means to fail. I have always done well, so I always expect to do well. I don\'t want to fail, but I don\'t fear it enough to do well. I wish that I was more motivated to succeed. College does not help me motivate myself. There are too many distractions and studying still is not very interesting. I studied so much and read so much when I was younger. Why have I lost interest? Why can\'t people leave me alone sometimes so that I can do my work? Why can\'t I concentrate on my work instead of running around with friends? I don\'t feel the pressure from my parents to do well. I need them pushing me. I can\'t work well without them pushing me. I am out of control right now because I can not adapt to college. Because I can\'t adapt, I feel stress and anxiety.       I would describe my first semester at college as a time of stress. I like being away from home. This makes me feel free. However, I seem to have no organization in my life, although I am learning slowly. I can not handle schedules. They make me feel pressured. My free time at college escapes me every day. I waste time a lot and it leaves me feeling empty. I like to set goals, but I hate following structured plans. When I am organized, I feel good, like I have accomplished something. When I skip class, I feel guilty and don\'t like myself. My biggest change is from a structured, sheltered life to a free, but often stressful life. I get stressed because I don\'t handle my free hours very well. I need someone or something to push me, but I hate being pushed. When I am forced, I feel cornered and self-conscious. I hate feeling self-conscious. I want to be myself, but I can\'t find myself. I act differently all the time, depending on where I am. I thought that I would discover myself at college, but i haven\'t so far and I am stressed and frustrated. I want to accomplish something, but I don\'t know how to, What am I really good at? I know that I am good at soccer, but with school I can\'t concentrate completely on my athletics. This is what I hate about college. I wish that I could play soccer all the time. I feel free when I am playing. I always thought that I was smart, but I\'ve found that I am not in college. If I was organized, I would be smart.

'    A major reason that I decided to come to college is because I would like to keep playing soccer. I know to some people that it seems quite silly to go to college to play a sport instead of to learn, but I came to college to do both. Soccer has been a part of my life for more than 12 years and my life for the last couple of years has revolved around my soccer schedule. I really enjoy the sport, but I have no intention of playing professionally bucause the chances are very slim that I would be able to. But I really wanted to play in college at a more competitive level and travel and really get involved in the school. Getting involved in college is a big step because there are so many new things to do and so many more people to meet. I was very popular in high school and it has been hard to adjust to being a \"nobody\" at college. It\'s like you\'re starting all over again. I am the kind of person who never loses friends so I am rather particular when picking my friends. There are so many people at college that you could meet a new person every day of the year. Some of these people you would be able to get along with and others you wouldn\'t. The whole idea of coming to college and meeting so many new people is just astonishing! I was really looking forward to meeting so many new people and now that it\'s here, I am not meeting as many people as I thought I would mainly because I am sortof shy. I hate being shy! I don\'t know what it is. I think it\'s because in my mind I think that if I say something out loud in front of a big group of people that I will make a fool out of myself, but I have made a fool out of myself before, so what\'s the big deal? I really get mad at myself sometimes for being the way I am and I really like to change the way I am. I\'m very outgoing around people that I have known for a while, but when it comes to meeting new people from all over the world and the country I get nervous and shy away. Since coming to college I have tried a little harder to get over my shyness and who knows, maybe someday I won\'t be shy at all.     The decision to attend a college plays a big part in the rest of your life. I want to succeed in life, someday have a family with a couple of kids, a beautiful wife and a lovely home. To me college seemed the best way to achieve all of this. I could have attended a college closer to home such as a junior college or an even smaller university, but I think it is a necessity for a young man to get out on his own, move into totally different surroundings, meet many new people, and begin to get used to living on your own. I also think it is necessary for you to move away from your parents at one time or another and college is the best answer. I am a very sensitive person and the thought of moving away from my friends killed me at first, but I got used to the idea and thought that it might be the best thing to do. I loved all of my friends a great deal and still do, but I thought that it was time that I got out on my own and met new people. It used to make me so angry when people said, \"Don\'t worry about losing your high school friends, you will meet so many more people at college that will end up being your life long buddies.\" Sure, I know that I will meet some people at college that I will know forever and maybe give my life to save their\'s, but I don\'t want to lose some of my high school friends nor do I want to hide the things in my past. I want to be able to remember all of the good times that we got drunk together. I also will never forget my high school friend that committed suicide. He was very dear to me and even though he wasn\'t one of my best friends it really shook me up. He was the kind of person that could put a smile on anybody and the guy who was always the life af a party. He was very good at hiding his emotions, no one ever knew what he was thinking deep down inside. He had school problems, but he was a very good artist and might have been able to get a scholarship, but his family had hardly any money and he didn\'t think that he would be able to go to college. So it seems that college plays an important part of everyone\'s life even though it is not a must.     A major reason I decided to go to college was because my parents wanted me to. If my parents were super rich and would give me money anytime i wanted or needed it, then I probably would not have gone to college. After all, what is the main reason most people go to college? To make money. Everyone wants to have a great job that pays lots of money so that they don\'t have to worry about things in life. I came to college to further my education so that one day I will become successful. It is a very tough decision to go to college, because it costs so much money and you are going to be away from your parents for so long. It seems strange to me that your parents save up money for you to go to college these days. Back in their days, they had to put themselves through college, but then again, there was a tremendous price difference. It also seems strange to me that parents save up money for their kids to go to college and hardly ever do the parents get a real \"Thank you,\" fro the opportunity that they have created for their children. I plan on doing something very special for my parents in the near future because I care about them a great deal. I love them! What can I say? They expect the best from me and I intend to give it to them. If they are nice enough to put me through 4 years of college, I guarantee you that I am going to work my balls off until I have succeeded in doing so. My whole family would expect nothing less from me. I also guarantee you that I am going to finish my 4 years at least and become a successful businessman to please my grandfather who is looking down on me at this very moment. He was so very special to me and I do not intend to let him down either. Also, why would someone want to put 12 years of school to waste. You need a high school education so much more with a college education. My parents have worked too hard in saving up for my college education for me to let them down now, but I think that even if I had to pay for it myself I would still go just to get the benefit of a college education.

'  Deepest emotions?  I seem to think my deepest emotions are in relation to friends that are guys and girlfriends. With friends I guess I\'m really receptive to whether people are being true friends or fake. It is on my mind a lot when with them. I just can\'t decide who is true and who is fake. With girls, I\'m slowly getting over a two year relationship. Coming here was bizarre. The girls are worse than the guys. I don\'t know, but some of the people, girls mostly are so into themselves it is scary. I have now found a girl that is just great. When coming here it was sick. To be popular all you had to do is have all the girls after you. It is so funny. I guess I have a lot of negative feelings, but I also know that once the year is over everything will be a lot better.  Getting into a fraternity, not being a freshman will relieve a lot of unwanted pressure.  One major stress is what if I would have gone somewhere else? I think everyone talks to friends that say oh my God it is so much fun here at the U of x.  It kindof sucks because a lot of my friends are failing here and thinking of transfering. I think those guys are having fun at other schools, but they blow it out of proportion so to make them look great!  SMU brings in a wide variety. You have some really cool guys and then some real fake people.  My deepest feeling that is starting to go away is my depression. It seemed like I was always depressed about something. With finals coming up I have to deal with that or it\'s all over. In all those stupid Arrow meetings they should have had one on depression and talk about college being serious, but not your entire life. That is my problem I take so serious I get bombed and it ruins my grades. I go through phases of depression then I say screw it and go out. Then I realize I have a test. It is a big cycle that I can\'t figure out.   Sum it up?  Well after a day like today negative feelings are flying, but those are just things caused by my performance on tests. When looking at the entire picture I think college is a game of luck. If you get the right teachers, meet the right guys, life can be easy. However, any other way can be hell. My first experiences have been good except the pressure I\'ve put on school. I have taken it so serious that I\'ve stressed out.  Coming to school has a lot of emotion included in it, but I think it is more expectation than anything. The stress is difficult, but it is all self-inflicted stress. I\'m not happy with my first semester, but I know I can bounce back. I think all college is, is putting yourself in the situation you want to be in. The choices are now up to me, not my parents. I think I had a lot of depression the last two times due to stress in school. I feel positive about the entire picture. I know what the school has to offer now that I\'ve been here a semester.  Coming to school was a big transition. It is something that you can\'t prepare for it just happens. I just hope I make the changes that I want to happen.  The transition is different for everyone. It is all in how you approach it and the attitude you keep while it is going on. It is an experience. I just wonder if it is the same for everyone.  Sum it up?

When first introduced to this I thought first about friendship. I\'ve always wondered who my friends are. This summer I had incidents when I wasn\'t sure if my friends were true. I left attitude. I\'m going to meet true friends. This thought relates back to my brother. I have idolized him for a long time. He had great friends and girlfriends. He is a photographer of famous people, but when I came to school I met a bunch of guys, but I was always worried about whether they were true friends. I still don\'t know.  My parents and I weren\'t real close or more my dad. I wasn\'t real close. So I couldn\'t say I missed them, but I miss home. Just a home. I\'m a very uptight person. I\'m always worried about things and in turn get real depressed. It sucks! But once, I got here I became even more depressed. I know this sounds common, but it is deep depression. It is scary too because one of my good friends this year ups and killed himself. he became very depressed and stabbed himself in the stomach. That scares me when I get depressed. Could I ever get that depressed? I get real depressed with school, but I don\'t do anything about it. the whole thing bothers me. I\'m really glad though that we are in a big city. Except sometimes I wish I could go walk in the woods and just think because everything is so upthight around here. It is scary. I think college is to big of stress all of a sudden. Teachers are so uptight. It is difficult. I\'m happy I\'m here. I look at my friends who went to the local side college UNL and I see no change except now they can\'t drink and do drugs without their parents bugging them. I\'m so glad I got away from that scene. I seriously don\'t know what I would be like if I would have had to do that. It would have been hell. Even my friends that went a little ways away are screwing up. The pressures of dorm life suck. My roommate is Psycho. He has worse luck than anybody else I know.      Coming to college? When first introduced to this I thought first about friendship. I\'ve always wondered who my friends are.

My roommate is Psycho. He has worse luck than anybody else I know.   Deepest emotions?  I seem to think my deepest emotions are in relation to friends that are guys and girlfriends. With friends I guess I\'m really receptive to whether people are being true friends or fake. It is on my mind a lot when with them. I just can\'t decide who is true and who is fake. With girls, I\'m slowly getting over a two year relationship. Coming here was bizarre. The girls are worse than the guys. I don\'t know, but some of the people, girls mostly are so into themselves it is scary. I have now found a girl that is just great. When coming here it was sick. To be popular all you had to do is have all the girls after you. It is so funny. I guess I have a lot of negative feelings, but I also know that once the year is over everything will be a lot better.  Getting into a fraternity, not being a freshman will relieve a lot of unwanted pressure.  One major stress is what if I would have gone somewhere else? I think everyone talks to friends that say oh my God it is so much fun here at the U of x.  It kindof sucks because a lot of my friends are failing here and thinking of transfering. I think those guys are having fun at other schools, but they blow it out of proportion so to make them look great!  SMU brings in a wide variety. You have some really cool guys and then some real fake people.  My deepest feeling that is starting to go away is my depression. It seemed like I was always depressed about something. With finals coming up I have to deal with that or it\'s all over. In all those stupid Arrow meetings they should have had one on depression and talk about college being serious, but not your entire life. That is my problem I take so serious I get bombed and it ruins my grades. I go through phases of depression then I say screw it and go out. Then I realize I have a test. It is a big cycle that I can\'t figure out.

The thing that really is ironic is that I am involved in sports for about 3 hours a day.  The thing that has been on my mind the most since I got here is an intimidation of other students.

For example, washing my own clothes, finding Sunday night dinner, deciding when to stop drinking, etc. These things are basic, but for beginners they become more difficult. However, these simple tasks of survival are only one part of college.  There are also many more emotions that I feel now. I said I would never miss seeing my family. This is not necessarily because we hated each other, but because I\'ve been trying to prove my independence, while my parents refuse to \"cut the umbilical cord\". It\'s not my whole family, just my mom really, but now, things have changed. I\'ve held steady to my promise, almost. I haven\'t been home since I got to SMU, but my parents have come to see me 6 times! Evidently they are attached to me more than I thought. They will actually drive for 5 hrs to get here just to see me for a couple of hours. This could be because they love me, or because they won\'t cut the string and want to check up on me. However, I do actually miss them at times. After all, they are my family and I did spend 18 years of my life with them.  There is also another aspect of college that has changed my life, social status. I really had some good friends, I mean great friends whom I will never forget! But I may never see them again. When I was in high school, I took so much for granted. I saw my friends every day, and it was great. Now I miss them. Sure I write and call, but it\'s not the same. I need to see them at least one more time. At graduation, the reality of never seeing some of the people I knew for 18 years didn\'t sink in. It wasn\'t until i got here that I realized there were things that    I\'ve had some changes in my morals since I got to college, or maybe not. For all I know, I already had them, but with the change in freedom brought with college they have not surfaced. I don\'t talk to my roommate about this because he would probably disapprove. However, I did discuss it with a very close friend from high school.  When I first got here, I was, in a sense, vulnerable to feelings. I had just left home and all of my friends as well. I needed someone whom I could latch on to, someone who would listen to me. The girl who I first met at a party seemed to provide the answer. I\'m not sure what made me do it, but we slept together later on. It was my first time. I didn\'t want to do it. I\'ve also wondered what \"making love\" or more casually \"fucking\" was all about. Sure, for the time it was a great moment. Nothing like anything I had felt before, but now, I think I regret the whole incident. I don\'t see the girl anymore. We hardly talk, and when we do, it\'s not about that night. She wasn\'t a virgin. She may be used to this sort of behavior, but I\'m not. It would have been easy to stop, but very embarassing, but I think I would have stopped if I had the chance again.  I haven\'t gone out really with other girls since that last relationship ended. It never really started. There was no beginning, just a middle and an end. My virginity was something I wanted to keep until my wedding, but I can\'t now. I really think I was manipulated.

'    After being at SMU a week, I now have a pretty good idea of what life here is like, and how I will fit in. This is something that worries me, because I\'m not sure that I will. This place has a fairly well deserved party reputation. The fraternities spare no expense to see that as much of the student body as possible can go to their parties. I have never been much of a partier and I never will. The fact that the social life here is so one dimensional is scary. If you don\'t rush you are left out, basically, though most people say otherwise. It seems that the greek system is dominant here at SMU. I worry that my friends will all join and I won\'t, leaving me and a few others high and dry (pardon the pun). I have nothing against having a good time, but it is too easy to get left out of the fun. I have visions of myself sitting in my dorm room watching as everyone else goes out. I don\'t think that will happen, but I don\'t know. It hurts to see all these people going out and having a good time while I\'m being left out. It has happened to me so often before. I don\'t want it to happen now. As far as my classes go I feel like I\'m probably doing all right. I could be better, i could be worse. Most of the people in my classes seem to be studying about as much as I am. if I work hard, I\'ll do fine. But, to work hard, I will miss out even more on what\'s going on here, There are too many people here who just come here to party, and not to study. Some of us do have to work to even stay here, and I wish others would respect that. If it gets to the point where I am just completely out of everything, I will just leave. I don\'t think it will be that bad though. I\'ve been here just over one week and in that time I\'ve already met quite a few people who I never thought I\'d ever get to meet. Over the next few weeks and months I hope to strengthen my relationship with the friends that I do have and to make new ones. I think the only way to be included in all that goes on here is to go out and get it for myself. I am going to try to. I hope it works. I believe it will.    When I came to SMU in July for AAARO I met with my advisor and for the first time was faced with real choices about what I was going to do with my life.  Officially, I am undecided, but that category only adds to my problem. I have basically no direction. That really worries me. I look around and see people who are confident about their futures. They have an idea, even if it is just an idea, about where they are going. I have none. The next four years will determine what I am going to do for the rest of my life. I have no set direction to help me. Such direction would help motivate me in my studies and in general. Not having any idea really leaves me hanging. I may turn out to do nothing here. I will have wasted all this time and money for nothing. I would then be a failure. Several members of my family (relatives) have done this. Every time we see them my parents always comment on what losers they are and how they will never amount to anything. I can see myself following this path all too well. To help me decide what I wanted to do I took a series of private tests designed to help me find a career that I would be good at. The results were horrible. Not only could I apparently not do any of the things that I had hoped to do, I couldn\'t do even things that I had thought about only in passing. They basically told me that I could not do anything. Literally nothing. Every time I see myself as undecided, I remember those tests. This hurts me because every time I meet up with a challenge I say to myself, \"don\'t bother,\" because in the long run I\'m supposedly doomed to failure in everything that I do. This shadow haunts me, it really does. I don\'t want to bother to study because I really don\'t care. If I\'m going to fail anyway, why bother? The only hint of direction that I have is pre-med. I don\'t know, maybe I\'ve been watching too much TV, but it\'s a thought. I haven\'t told my parents yet because they will probably laugh at me. I\'m only fair at math and science so why am I bothering? I don\'t really know. It\'s a dream. If I don\'t at least give it a shot I\'ll probably never forgive myself. So hey, why not. I have nothing else to do.    My deepest emotions about college were those of excitement and fear. The levels of each changed in intensity as the time to leave home drew closer. When I first came out here to visit, I was nervous, but that changed when I got to know the place a bit better. The excitement grew as I got my acceptance and scholarship. Despite the football jokes, everyone at home was proud, including myself. I am the first one in my family to go off to college, so all my cousins and brothers and sisters were really looking up to me. I felt special and I feel as if I have to really prove myself to them. It puts a lot of pressure on me deep inside knowing they are all watching how I do. When I go home for Thanksgiving and Christmas they will all be asking me things about my experiences here. I hope I have good things to tell them.  As the day to leave home grew nearer my excitement turned to sheer terror. I drove around town looking at things for the \"last time\" before I left. Most of my friends left before I did and it really tore me up watching them all go knowing that my time was coming soon. I wondered why I had not chosen to go to a local college so I could be near home. It amazed me how family problems seemed to dissapear. everyone was going to miss me. I procrastinated until the last day over packing, refusing to strip the room of my character. I felt really sick. I could not eat, sleep, or do anything. I really did not want to go. I thought of telling my parents that I wanted to stay home, but I did not. Everything was fine in the car until we got here. I wanted to stay in the hotel room with my parents. I did not want to move into my room or meet my roommate. The same feeling of sickness fell over me as I watched the car pull out of the driveway and saw them leave. But, as before, once they were away I felt fine. It was time to move on with my life. I still feel that sadness when I talk to them on the phone. I worry if when I go home, will I want to come back? I hope so. I like it here. It\'s really not so bad. Being in a freshman dorm really helps because everyone is going through the same things that I am.

'    My personal adjustments to college have gone rather smoothly, but I tend to feel quite depressed at times about different things. I miss my friends from home very much. I\'m a friendly person and I can\'t wait to get to know people, but I\'m having trouble here and I get down on myself. The people here just don\'t seem as friendly. I\'m in the band too and I\'ve gotten to be friends with many people there. The band has made me feel like I have a whole new family to turn to since I can\'t be with my own family. I do have some conflicts with some of the people in band, but I made many close friendships with quite a few of them. The college life academically has gotten me depressed somewhat. College is much harder than high school was and I\'m having to struggle much more since I am so used to putting things off. My grades are a lot worse than they were in high school. I am looking at myself more negatively every day. My attitude seems to be changing too. I am a nice and happy person, but lately I have been a real grouch and I\'m just not relating to people like I always have in the past. I\'m not having as much fun doing things as I have before. I am becoming very stressed. I often think about myself as being a loser now. Failing out of college and not making myself into what I want to be. Lately I have tried to get like my old self, and I seem to be getting along with people like I always have, but as soon as I think I\'m okay, something else hits me like a slap in the face and turns my whole image of myself around. I want college to be fun and I want to enjoy myself, but I am having a tough time mentally taking myself through it. I\'m not at a point where I\'m going to crack or anything, but I am constantly analyzing myself and trying to make myself the way I want to be. This bullshit about being a freshman and having to do all kinds of stupid things and constantly being told what to do is really pissing me off. I thought college was going to be a more mature place to be at, but I guess I was wrong. I\'m tired of all this. Why can\'t everybody just respect others at this age instead of acting like little 1st graders constantly picking on each other. College has been a real switch for me. I am having a good time here with the people I\'ve met in band and the people I already knew, it\'s just a few little things that I think I\'m blowing out of proportion. These little things are really getting to me, though.    When I decided I was going away to another city for college, I thought that I would be getting away from a lot of pressures at home and have a really great time here, worry free. I guess I was wrong. There are so many things going on at one time that I become delirious with thousands of different things to think about. I\'m constantly worrying about my grades. I know I can do better, but I just can\'t seem to do it. I don\'t know if it\'s a negative attitude I have or just a problem of self-discipline. Maybe both. The people around me are affecting my mental picture too. I have many mood swings just from people reacting differently towards me. It seems I am affected more here than I was at home. Maybe it\'s because of the new environment. It probably has to do with all the stress I\'m under too. From extra-curricular activities, grades, and classes combined. It\'s a whole new ball game being out here on my own, dealing with my own problems and not having my parents there to solve them when I really need to be supported. The people I meet here are all from different places and they all have different attitudes. I am having a tough time adjusting my characteristics to theirs. Many upper classmen want me to be the way they want me to be. Maybe all this arrogant upper classmen bullshit with hazing is going to do me some good, but I don\'t see how. So far I have learned many things from my experiences in college. I am learning to survive on my own better and adjust to different situations easier. I think I need to be less sensitive towards people and the way they treat me or act towards me and just pay attention to what I am and what I want to be. I think college is going to help me in shaping myself and letting me get to know who I really am and what I want to do with the rest of my life. I am learning to make better decisions on things and work out situations that used to be quite confusing and troublesome to me. I want to get to know people and have close friendships.     I am feeling a lot better today than I was yesterday. Like I said before, I have these mood swings that are affected be little things. My roommate is really starting to get on my nerves. I like him a lot, but he doesn\'t seem to understand that I live in the same place he does. He constantly uses my stuff and borrows things without asking. I don\'t understand why he can\'t just ask. He always expects me to do things for him too. I\'m not his mother and I have my own life to deal with. I don\'t quite understand the attitude at this school either. I came from a school where there was lots of spirit and everyone helped each other out and supported each other, but here there is almost no spirit and few people get involved with things to help support SMU. The kids here act like SMU owes them a favor for being here. That is totally absurd. I really can\'t stand all these arrogant guys and girls who walk around thinking they\'re so good compared to everyone else. As far as I\'m concerned, they can get run over by a truck and I along with others, probably wouldn\'t care. It\'s people like this that give SMU the name it has and that sucks. Everybody thinks we\'re snobs and I don\'t want to be classified as one. Why does everyone here act that way? It\'s stupid. I\'m also having a tough time with my self-discipline. I can\'t seem to control myself. Every time I get out of class I either go to the student center to talk and play games or I go back to my room and sleep. I seem to always be tired. I guess it\'s because of all the stressful events that are going on around me. I can never make myself do my homework because I am constantly worrying about other things. I worry a lot about proving myself to other people, like upper classmen. The only way it seems you can get to know them is by proving yourself to them by being the way they want you to be or doing things constantly for them.    I am feeling a lot better today than I was yesterday. Like I said before, I have these mood swings that are affected be little things. My roommate is really starting to get on my nerves. I like him a lot, but he doesn\'t seem to understand that I live in the same place he does. He constantly uses my stuff and borrows things without asking. I don\'t understand why he can\'t just ask. He always expects me to do things for him too. I\'m not his mother and I have my own life to deal with. I don\'t quite understand the attitude at this school either. I came from a school where there was lots of spirit and everyone helped each other out and supported each other, but here there is almost no spirit and few people get involved with things to help support SMU. The kids here act like SMU owes them a favor for being here. That is totally absurd. I really can\'t stand all these arrogant guys and girls who walk around thinking they\'re so good compared to everyone else. As far as I\'m concerned, they can get run over by a truck and I along with others, probably wouldn\'t care. It\'s people like this that give SMU the name it has and that sucks. Everybody thinks we\'re snobs and I don\'t want to be classified as one. Why does everyone here act that way? It\'s stupid. I\'m also having a tough time with my self-discipline. I can\'t seem to control myself. Every time I get out of class I either go to the student center to talk and play games or I go back to my room and sleep. I seem to always be tired. I guess it\'s because of all the stressful events that are going on around me. I can never make myself do my homework because I am constantly worrying about other things. I worry a lot about proving myself to other people, like upper classmen. The only way it seems you can get to know them is by proving yourself to them by being the way they want you to be or doing things constantly for them.     My personal adjustments to college have gone rather smoothly, but I tend to feel quite depressed at times about different things. I miss my friends from home very much. I\'m a friendly person and I can\'t wait to get to know people, but I\'m having trouble here and I get down on myself. The people here just don\'t seem as friendly. I\'m in the band too and I\'ve gotten to be friends with many people there. The band has made me feel like I have a whole new family to turn to since I can\'t be with my own family. I do have some conflicts with some of the people in band, but I made many close friendships with quite a few of them. The college life academically has gotten me depressed somewhat. College is much harder than high school was and I\'m having to struggle much more since I am so used to putting things off. My grades are a lot worse than they were in high school. I am looking at myself more negatively every day. My attitude seems to be changing too. I am a nice and happy person, but lately I have been a real grouch and I\'m just not relating to people like I always have in the past. I\'m not having as much fun doing things as I have before. I am becoming very stressed. I often think about myself as being a loser now. Failing out of college and not making myself into what I want to be. Lately I have tried to get like my old self, and I seem to be getting along with people like I always have, but as soon as I think I\'m okay, something else hits me like a slap in the face and turns my whole image of myself around. I want college to be fun and I want to enjoy myself, but I am having a tough time mentally taking myself through it. I\'m not at a point where I\'m going to crack or anything, but I am constantly analyzing myself and trying to make myself the way I want to be. This bullshit about being a freshman and having to do all kinds of stupid things and constantly being told what to do is really pissing me off. I thought college was going to be a more mature place to be at, but I guess I was wrong. I\'m tired of all this. Why can\'t everybody just respect others at this age instead of acting like little 1st graders constantly picking on each other. College has been a real switch for me. I am having a good time here with the people I\'ve met in band and the people I already knew, it\'s just a few little things that I think I\'m blowing out of proportion. These little things are really getting to me, though.    When I decided I was going away to another city for college, I thought that I would be getting away from a lot of pressures at home and have a really great time here, worry free. I guess I was wrong. There are so many things going on at one time that I become delirious with thousands of different things to think about. I\'m constantly worrying about my grades. I know I can do better, but I just can\'t seem to do it. I don\'t know if it\'s a negative attitude I have or just a problem of self-discipline. Maybe both. The people around me are affecting my mental picture too. I have many mood swings just from people reacting differently towards me. It seems I am affected more here than I was at home. Maybe it\'s because of the new environment. It probably has to do with all the stress I\'m under too. From extra-curricular activities, grades, and classes combined. It\'s a whole new ball game being out here on my own, dealing with my own problems and not having my parents there to solve them when I really need to be supported. The people I meet here are all from different places and they all have different attitudes. I am having a tough time adjusting my characteristics to theirs. Many upper classmen want me to be the way they want me to be. Maybe all this arrogant upper classmen bullshit with hazing is going to do me some good, but I don\'t see how. So far I have learned many things from my experiences in college. I am learning to survive on my own better and adjust to different situations easier. I think I need to be less sensitive towards people and the way they treat me or act towards me and just pay attention to what I am and what I want to be. I think college is going to help me in shaping myself and letting me get to know who I really am and what I want to do with the rest of my life. I am learning to make better decisions on things and work out situations that used to be quite confusing and troublesome to me. I want to get to know people and have close friendships.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.14,0,3.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,1.57,0,0,0,0,3.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.93,Male20b
'    Yesterday I talked a lot about coming to college where as today I\'m gonnatry to talk about now that I am in college. A week before coming here I was very excited yet very scared because I didn\'t know what to expect. It was like starting all over again. The first days here I was alright. I made friends quickly and a lot I did make, but I can remember specifically waiting for my roommate to arrive so I could meet him, I was very excited about this. Finally later on that evening he did arrive. He is nothing special, but mostly he doesn\'t have all that much personality. He is very into nothing. He makes like no friends, which dissapointed me greatly because the only friends he has are the people I introduce him to, but the worst part about it is that my very best friend from home also came here and we didn\'t room together because we figured we could meet more people this way. The way we figured is that with the personality match up test we would room with people like ourselves and frankly if I\'m like my roommate, then I really am nothing like I thought I was. Maybe deep down so far down I am like that and all my personality is just a cover. (I hope not, and I doubt it.) Ok, that\'s the roommate scoop. Nextly I figured classes wouldn\'t be much harder than my high school, being that it is one of the finest in the country, wrong! It was the same class style, but tests were completely hard to the furthest extreme. I figured I was prepared to the limit when all of a sudden, bang! \"Where is this from?\" \"We never learned that.\" How depressing. It would put me down, but I would try not to admit it. Do you know how frustrating it is to get a C on every English paper you turn in when you figure you would get at least a B? It\'s so futile that I didn\'t even try on my last paper because I knew I\'d get a C and I did. Bummer!     Coming to college for me was the thing to do for the reason that everyone in my high school did it and if you didn\'t you were the 1 or 2 out of 125 that got looked down on. Don\'t get me wrong I kindof wanted to come for the education all else, but I was very scared. In high school I thought a lot about college, do this, do that you have to get into a good school. But I really don\'t want to go because here at home I was - I had it made. I was popular, athletic, had the best girlfriend in the world, and did well in school. I realized how great this was and I loved it. It took a long time to get all that I had and to think I would have to start from scratch. What if I couldn\'t do it? What if I were to loose my girlfriend, one of the people I loved most in my life, not many people have been able to do it. All I hear is it will never work. How discouraging because I can\'t stand the thought of losing her. Sports meant a lot to me as well, All State football, All State Lacross two years, All State honorable mention Wrestling. Sports took tons of time and a lot of dedication just like my girlfriend. Luckily, though I found Lacross here and think the guys are great and that\'s a lot of time and effort. Anyhow now being here I am homesick, but just for the people I love like family and my bed. Anyhow, I found my adjustment pretty easily since I\'m doing well, having my best friend from home come with me to the same school made things easier as well. Thinking about being at school also brings the question to me, why school? I worked at a gas station and loved it. The reason I guess is society, but even more than that is money, but to tell you the truth if I had all the money I ever needed for me and my family and the capability of supporting my parents when they grew old, I might still be working at that gas station making $5 an hour. One of the guys I worked with there tells me how he went to school and dropped out because his parents died and he couldn\'t afford to stay in. I sometimes wish he were here rather than me because he knows what he wants, he wants to be a judge like his dad was. I can only feel sympathy for him because he is brilliant guy. If I had the money I myself would pay for him, but not now, but I guess in about 5 years.

Why did I come to college I believe is to be like my old man, smart and a well rounded person. Or should I say to get smarter and more well rounded. Leaving my family wasn\'t easy, the thought of it was always on my mind, but frequent calls home made me feel better.

Overall, I love my parents for all they have done and I realize it now more than ever. My brother and I always had this relationship where there was fierce competition.

He was All-State athlete in 3 sports which he helped me a lot in. He now goes to University of Notre Dame, is in engineering and plays varsity lacrosse. I am so proud of him and he is of me. Being this far apart has really brought us closer together and I can\'t wait to see him and talk with him when I go home. Overall, money I realize is not everything. It\'s nice, but you know your family will be there for you all the time no matter what the conditions. They will always love me and I will them. College is really just something that makes you a more well rounded person so you can associate better with others.

'    My fundamental reason for coming here has been to get an education, but as I have found out, it is much more than that. It is learning about leaving friends and family, adapting socially, and coping with stress. The first two were easy to deal with, although everytime I go home I wish I had gone to college with the people I know and love. Hopefully, here I will also make friends such as the ones back home. When I return to SMU from visiting home it feels great to be back, until I go to class. In class is where my stress originates. Tests, papers, and projects, in all of my classes, all at once! How do the professors expect us to find time to do them all and do them efficiently. I mean, students are trying to adjust to college life and socially fit in, but how can they if they have to spend all their time eating or studying. I have to keep a 3/0 GPA or my parents are going to pull me out of SMU and bring me back home to go to school, which sometimes I don\'t think is so bad. I really don\'t want to go home, but as each day passes I think I\'m getting closer to going to OU (Oklahoma U) or OSU (Oklahoma State U), which are where most of my friends went because they couldn\'t afford to come here! I really wish at least one of them would have come to SMU, it would\'ve made life a lot easier. I am glad I came here, don\'t get me wrong. I just didn\'t expect college to be so much harder than High school, which was really easy for me. I had so much extra time then. Now I have something I have to do every minute of the day. Like a lot of students, I have a bad tendancy to procrastinate. this when all of the work piles up and stress really hits.    I came to SMU primarily for two reasons. One, it supposedly offers one of the best educations in the nation, and two, it offered me the most money. Money, as I have noticed, is flaunted quite a bit here. Everywhere I look people are driving rich cars and wearing expensive clothes. I kindof resent these people because a lot of them act snobbish and don\'t really care about their grades. They don\'t have to worry about keeping a scholarship to go here. They have everything handed to them on a silver platter by \"Mommy\" and \"Daddy\". Now, if these people had earned their money themselves I could respect them, but somehow I don\'t think most of them have. The education here so far as I can tell is fine, but I don\'t have anything to compare it to other than high school, which is next to nothing.  I wish SMU had fall rush like most other schools. A lot of my friends at OSU and OU have joined fraternities and they love it. I think that if SMU had fall rush it would help the freshmen fit in a little more. I for one, have been to a couple of fraternity parties and felt that I didn\'t really fit in because I didn\'t know hardly anybody. With all the Greek occurrences going on and the publicity of the Greek system it makes the freshmen feel somewhat isolated.  I also love the independence that college allows. I bleached part of my hair, which is something I never would have done at home. My taste in music has also changed from pop / rock to punk. I don\'t know if the changes I\'ve gone through is for better or worse. With my luck, my parents will say it is for the worse.    My fundamental reason for coming here has been to get an education, but as I have found out, it is much more than that.

'     The summer went by quickly and I spent time at the beach. I am from Florida. Since I knew that getting to the beach would be a little hard from SMU. I also began to realize the time that I spent with my brothers (younger 11th, 10th grade high school) was special. I am not going to have younger brothers to do anything with in college. Consequently, I made an effort to do more things with them than I had done in the past. I do not know if they realized that I was doing that. I probably miss my middle brother more than my youngest brother because he is as big as me and does not look like a younger whimpy kid. I guess we were more of equals, as I saw it. Although, he still had more education to go. I think he still thought of me as older and wiser and not along the lines of equals. This is not to say that I dislike my youngest brother, I guess that the difference in age made it harder to relate to one another.  On to my parents. Let me say that I have a great family life and strong family values. This type of family life is considered rare in a society where divorce and cheating and unhappy families are prevelant. One more point is that I am religious to the point of going to church each week and believing in God. My parents raised me this way. I was sad to leave my parents behind. I really love them and care for them. I do miss them, but not as much as I thought I might. Maybe I have been too busy to think much about home. I also think that my parents did a good job of raising me to let me feel this way about leaving home at this time. Maybe being homesick will hit me later, but for now I am doing ok.  I did leave behind some friends. However, I wanted to go to a college where I could start over and meet new friends.

I know that my parents had been saving the money and could afford it, but I pondered if this was really right for me. My parents would have respected my decision if I had not chosen college however, I would have had to assume more responsibility around the house. I thought (to myself) spending time traveling in Europe over the summer would have been fun. This was more of a wish than reality. I never told them of my idea. I thought further and decided that college really was the best for me at this time. I do not think that I am educated enough to assume full responsibility for my own life. After some thought, I began to get excited about going to college and the entire college experience. Taking the SAT and ACT was a way of saying \"You\'re on the road to a higher education and life.\" The summer went by quickly and I spent time at the beach. I am from Florida. Since I knew that getting to the beach would be a little hard from SMU. I also began to realize the time that I spent with my brothers (younger 11th, 10th grade high school) was special. I am not going to have younger brothers to do anything with in college. Consequently, I made an effort to do more things with them than I had done in the past. I do not know if they realized that I was doing that. I probably miss my middle brother more than my youngest brother because he is as big as me and does not look like a younger whimpy kid. I guess we were more of equals, as I saw it. Although, he still had more education to go. I think he still thought of me as older and wiser and not along the lines of equals. This is not to say that I dislike my youngest brother, I guess that the difference in age made it harder to relate to one another.

'    One of the most difficult parts about coming to college was leaving my girlfriend behind in San Antonio. I knew that holding on to a relationship would be hard because we would see each other only about three times each semester. We began the semester saying that we would not date any other people. Everything was ok for a while, but then I went out with another girl several times. I felt really bad, but I wasn\'t able to tell her. I still feel really guilty. We have now agreed to date other people. I started to date a girl here, but I don\'t think she is seeing anyone. I feel like she is holding on to the past and not letting herself have any fun. We will still go out whenever I am home, but what happens during the rest of the time? She is so caught up in her relationship with me that she is ruining her senior year in high school. that really bothers me because that was such a fun year for me and most other people that I know. She has been asked out by several guys, but has turned them down. I don\'t know how to make her let go without hurting her too bad. This has caused a lot of stress. I have spent many nights on the phone listening to her cry and I have even been in tears once or twice. I still have strong feelings for her. I hate the situation because if I was going to school at home everything would be fine. I realize that I have to let go of that relationship or I will have a bad time here. I just wish she could cope with the situation as well as I am. We won\'t even be seeing each other very much next year. If we are still going out I will see her during the summer, but next fall she is headed for the University of Penn. I wish there was an easy way to get out of this relationship without having anyone hurt. The pressure of dealing with that has just made moving away from home even more difficult. Not to mention the phone bills which causes problems between my parents and I. I feel like it is my fault that she isn\'t having fun in school. I quite often feel guilty about the entire situation.    Leaving for college was exciting, but has caused a lot of pressure from my parents, especially my mother. I was adopted by them at birth. I have an older brother who is 20. He went to college for one semester and then dropped out. He still lives at home. His grades were always pretty bad. I made fairly good grades in high school. My parents have always expected and pushed me to make good grades. Many times I wasn\'t really motivated for any reason except to please them. Here my grades are not that great. My GPA is between 2/6 and 2/8 I have been constantly receiving parental pressure to bring up my grades. They are very supportive, but always pressure me. I feel like I owe it to them to make good grades because of all they have given me and the money they have spent on college. I really get upset sometimes over this because my parents really don\'t understand what life is like up here. They both graduated from college in the 1950\'s. They really don\'t understand all of the activities that go on. There are so many decisions that must be made on whether to go out and have fun or study. I am here to get an education, but building new friendships and relationships is also very important. I am having trouble balancing academics and making friendships and I have no way of helping my parents understand that. Even in high school, regardless of my grades my parents always thought I could do better and wasn\'t studying enough. My mom is really old fashioned and out of touch with what it is like growing up in the 1980\'s. She grew up on a farm in east Texas. There were only 80 to 100 kids in her entire school. My high school had 200. They don\'t understand.    One of the most exciting parts about moving to SMU has been making new friends. I was a bit scared before getting here of what things would be like. My first week of orientation was kind of scary, as well. I began wondering what does my roommate think of me? Who will I become close friends? These types of questions faded soon as I kindof found my group. I have met so many people from all over the country. My roommate amd I get along well. As a matter of fact, most of the people on our floor get along. I am really ecstatic about the whole situation. I have never had to wonder who I would eat with, go out with on weekends or anything like that. I don\'t always go out with the same group of people either. I have 3 or 4 different sets of friends. I am certainly closer to some than others, but I consider them all good friends. I am able to discuss problems and ask advice from these people. I never feel alone or like I have no one to confide in. This is different than high school. I usually went out with basically the same group. I had two really close friends. The rest were really cool, but I was not able to discuss important personal matters with some of them. These people have been the most important factor in enjoying SMU. I really feel like I can trust these friends and they haven\'t given me any reason to think otherwise yet. I feel extremely secure in that area at this time. It\'s really comforting to know that I have people to talk to when  I\'m having problems.  My friends have helped me deal with the problems I have had including the ones I wrote about in the previous two nights. When I was fighting a lot with my girlfriend they helped me not to become depressed or severely angered. They always had something funny  to say. I even received help from them in dealing with my parents. Several of them were even experiencing similar difficulties. I know that there will never be a time when everything goes well. There will always be problems. I think learning to deal with pressures and setbacks is essential. So long as I have people that I am not afraid to discuss problems with, I     One of the most difficult parts about coming to college was leaving my girlfriend behind in San Antonio.

'    Since I have become a freshman at SMU I have realized the things I took for granted are gone. I really miss being with my mother who is very thoughtful, and doing the things we use to do together. She was always there for me when I had my questions to ask her. We could always relate to each other on the same level.  Another thing that has happened is that me and my girlfriend have separated from each other. It\'s hard being apart from her because we were always together for the whole year and a half that we went out. We are still together, but the bond between us feels like it has just flew away. We try so hard to stay together and it has only been a week. We share a lot of things together, things I couldn\'t even share with my mom. I hope we stick it out through the four years tha I am up here. I miss her voice and her nice soft touch. it makes me wonder if I should\'ve stayed home and went to college with her. It\'s hard to relate my feelings with anyone here because I don\'t trust them like I do my mom and Cindy (my girlfriend).  Since I started thinking about SMU, me and my dad have become closer. My parents were divorced since I was seven years old and I really grew up without a dad. He was never there when I needed him. He never attended any of my games that I played in sports. i guess it finally hit him that I grew up and was leaving for college. The last month and a half me and my father have started to become closer. Before, I never use to call him dad, I always called him by his first name. Now lately, since we have started to become closer, I have called him dad about ten times. i can tell he likes it when I do, but it is just so hard for me to do so. I wonder now if he needs me. I wonder if I should be there for him. He was never there for me, but I guess people can be forgiven of their mistakes if they realize what they have done. I really think coming to college, helped me and my father become closer and start to form this bond. I know I have probably lost some pretty good friends coming to school so far away, but my education was more important. I would love to stay home and have fun with them, but I can\'t. I have to realize that I am in college and I have to make some big decisions. I still wish they will be my friends in the end because true friendship never ends. I have also became lonelier at night because I don\'t have someone to sit down with and talk about my problems.     Here we are again. I guess I will stop where I left off. I wish I would\'ve grown up being closer to my dad, but maybe it was meant for us not to become close until I was about to leave for college. I\'m glad that we have become closer the past couple of months. It doesn\'t matter how close me and my father are compared to my mom. I know it is hard for her to see me gone because I was her favorite. I really miss my mom a lot and wish I could see her every day. It\'s hard not having her there to talk to all the time. She always seems to come up with the right answers to my questions. i know she is feeling lonely at home and that bugs me. I wish I was there to keep her company and talk to her. I miss all my good friends that I made that stayed home. You come up to college and everything is strange. You meet a lot of strangers and become friends with some of them. I like coming to college for my education, but as for coming here to get away, I miss my mom and family. I also miss my girlfriend back home. She treats me so good that I\'m scared to lose her because I\'m afraid there isn\'t anyone out there like her. She is loving, caring, and understanding. Cindy and I are going through a lot right now and I wish it would stop. I wish everything was back to normal. I want to be at home right now hugging and kissing her. Another thing I miss from coming to college is playing sports in high school. I always look back and wish I had another year to play because I loved the game of basketball so much. I wish I could start all over and stay back a year in order to do so, but i can\'t. So all I can do is sit and think about the past and hopefully I benefit in the future. Well, I guess there is nothing I can do. I\'m glad I\'m finally off to college so I can start my life and not have to put up with anybody\'s shit. I want to go on and finish and start my family. I also finally get to see how it feels to be away from home and see how hard it is on your own. I guess I\'m doing a pretty good job.      I guess I\'ll start to talk about my future here at SMU I really love the school and there are some great people here. I hope to finish college at SMU, but that might be kindof difficult. My parents want me to go here and I like it a lot, except for one reason, I hate making my parents put out so much money for me to just come to school. I really appreciate them doing so and that\'s why I am trying to make good grades. I want to please them and myself, and show that I am able to handle college easily. I hope my dad follows through on his end of the deal or else I won\'t be attending SMU next fall. I want to show my father especially the good grades because then he will back me up in anything else i do. I hope I can handle being away from my parents for four years. I am so use to my mom giving me advice and helping me out with my problems. I just don\'t want to rush into anything I can\'t handle. I have to take 18 hours every semester to help me through Pre-business and Pre-med. I wonder if I should try and do all this in five years or cram it all into 4 years. I guess my future here will be promising if I make good grades such as A\'s and B\'s. I am still worried about not having a close enough friend to rely and count on. I want someone I can talk to and discuss my problems with. I miss my mom again everytime I think about something that is important that I want to say. I guess I will find someone who will listen and I won\'t be so home sick anymore. I also feel obligated to give my mom something back for sending me through school. I hope my future here is good so I can repay her with a little reward. I also feel that for me coming to college, it gives my mom happiness because she is seeing me doing something constructive.    Here we are again.

I want to show my father especially the good grades because then he will back me up in anything else i do. I hope I can handle being away from my parents for four years. I am so use to my mom giving me advice and helping me out with my problems. I just don\'t want to rush into anything I can\'t handle. I have to take 18 hours every semester to help me through Pre-business and Pre-med. I wonder if I should try and do all this in five years or cram it all into 4 years. I guess my future here will be promising if I make good grades such as A\'s and B\'s. I am still worried about not having a close enough friend to rely and count on. I want someone I can talk to and discuss my problems with. I miss my mom again everytime I think about something that is important that I want to say. I guess I will find someone who will listen and I won\'t be so home sick anymore. I also feel obligated to give my mom something back for sending me through school. I hope my future here is good so I can repay her with a little reward. I also feel that for me coming to college, it gives my mom happiness because she is seeing me doing something constructive.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.41,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.86,0,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,9.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.63,Male20b
'    I was really ready to come to college. I have been anxiously awaiting it for about a year. I mean I\'ve always been excited to come, but my senior year seemed endless. I really got tired of the high shchool teeny bopper bullshit that went on, and was ready for college and the attitude that goes along with it. Not the snob attitude that SMU is stereotyped with, but the intellectual stigma that is so prevalent on college campus. Even small campuses have that, well almost a peer pressure to learn, and I really like that. I was also damn ready to study theatre seriously. I was sick and tired of no talent, out for the attention, high school kids who called themselves thespians (with a dramatic flair!) Once here, I\'ve found that there are people who live, eat, and breath theatre as do I.  What else?  Okay, No. It\'s good to see other people who have the same mind set as do I.  I was so ready to get away from my parents. I don\'t know that I could\'ve taken anymore of her guilt trips, and mid-Americaness, and everything else about her. Why must she always have to out do her kids? Why are her projects, her interests so damn much more important than ours. Sure, I wouldn\'t be here without them. Well, I could find a way, but yes, they support me, and blah blah blah, but they annoy the hell out of me. Well, she does.  Well, back to college. Things seem slower than I thought. I wanted to jump into theatre, lose myself in it. I\'ve already not made the 1st show so the jumping. Maybe college is going to show me I won\'t make it. I hope not. I have to. I always have. There\'s a lot of, not negative, it\'s just that everyone here is use to being the top dog (I hate cliches) and now we must be the top dog of the top dogs. There\'s so much pressure. I can take it. I sometimes write things that contradict each other. I hope that\'s okay.  What else?  I wanted to start over when I got here. I didn\'t want to get in with the gay crowd right off. Society just can\'t take it. My roommate is flaming. What do they think about me? I don\'t want them to know. I have to study. Anyway, I don\'t want them to know right off. I\'m sure they suspect, but once they know then it engulfs you. You\'re not a dancer, You\'re gay. I hate it. I\'m not responsible enough. I\'m not ready to take charge of my own life. I\'m really not psycho just confused, you know? That\'s why I perform. What else? I can\'t do this for 3 days. I don\'t feel strongly enough about enough stuff.  What else?   I only regretted leaving Janelle. The\'s the only friend who listened to me. Kirsten was all herself, self, self, self. Heather lives far away anyway. I miss Janelle. I miss my sister. How can she stand Mother by herself? Ohhh. I\'ve really led a pretty cush life. I don\'t have \"my father beat me my uncle raped me\" stories to tell.     Okay, now that the dramatics are over, let\'s be more realistic.  I am scared today. Scared that what (yes these are dramatics again) scared that what I\'ve thought I wanted my whole life, well since I\'d been able to recognize what I want, maybe isn\'t right for me. I\'ve never wanted anything, but a life of performing. Now I wonder, do I have what it takes? There are people here who are as talented as I. I\'ve not encountered an abundance of that before, now there are lots of them! And there are 100\'s of campuses, many of them with outstanding programs like SMU all over with more talented people. It\'s scary.  I also don\'t have time to do all that I need to! If I don\'t wash soon I\'ll be walking around naked. I have to read my PSYCHOLOGY. I need to research a monologue. There just isn\'t enough time. College seems a lot more, well my attitude seems a lot more optimistic now because I was sick earlier and now I am better. I was beginning to think I hated college. It\'s true, however that college will never live up to what I want it to be. It\'s been my salvation for the last year. I\'ve wanted the independence, the maturity, the people with minds and ideas and ohhh! It\'s all so exciting, but like I said, it\'ll never be quite how I imagined it.  I worried about really stupid things. I worried that people would look down on me that most of my tapes were copied instead of originals! I worried that I wouldn\'t be well read enough so I read everything this summer and don\'t remember any of it. I never worried that I wouldn\'t fit in though. Performing Arts people have a common bond and there\'s always something to talk about.  I worried (and still do) about being gay. I don\'t want people to know because it\'s not \"acceptable\". Although it\'s very much a part of me. I\'m by no means flaming, but I\'m not Bill the stud either. Anyway, I was pretty stressed out about it, and I still try to be careful because people can be really heartless. During Orientation there was a meeting at which the subject of homosexuality came up, and the general concensus was that they should be herded up and shot. I felt obligated to defend them, but didn\'t want to be labeled on day one. It\'s really a tricky situation and one of the things I worried about the most.  Sometimes I step back and contemplate the fact that things other than theatre go on here.  I don\'t know if this will screw you up because it\'s specifically SMU, but the bit with football was the last thing on my mind. In fact I don\'t think the incoming freshmen are very stressed at all about it. All summer I got info and phone calls and blah, blah, blah, explaining what had happened. I don\'t care!  SMU\'s a great school I don\'t give a whatever if they don\'t have football, tennis basketball or soccer.  MY mind is running out of anxieties to create. Actually, coming to college wasn\'t too stressful for me at all. In fact it was exciting. I dug down to some feelings that just weren\'t there yesterday and today I\'ve tried to stay deep, yet at a reality level.  The professors here don\'t seem like stereotypical college professors. They seem very young, and very down to earth. I\'m not doubting them at all.    I was really ready to come to college. I have been anxiously awaiting it for about a year.

My future here at SMU, I think that I shall be thoroughly prepared for grad school by the time I graduate. I don\'t know that I\'ll be ready for the \"real world.\" I\'m excited about the quality of the theatre faculty here. They really know what\'s going on. This isn\'t the stuff you want to hear.  I\'m kind of scared about the future. Ideas that I thought were unbudgeable in my head are starting to loosen.  Maybe this isn\'t for me. I really shouldn\'t think that. I know it is for me.  It\'s hard for me to write today. I\'m so tired. I have found that studying is much more intense here and the quantity is also much higher than high school. It\'s exciting though, having everyone so excited to study and professors who specialize in a particular area. It\'s great. I\'m so tired.  I got letters from home today which I thought would make me homesick, but no.  I\'m really having a hard time creating more to write.  All in all college has been a positive experience for me. I\'ve had little stress except when I was sick and everything seemed to fall apart.  We explored ourselves in DAT today maybe that\'s why I\'m having trouble expressing myself tonight. The words just aren\'t flowing. I\'m so tired.  I\'m sorry I just can\'t think, but the pen is supposed to keep moving so I\'ll just babble for awhile. I\'ve covered all my anxieties, People not liking me, difficult classes, getting in with the wrong group, missing friends, not keeping up talentwise with them here.  Everyone in college is much more mature than in high school. That\'s a generality, but for the most part, it\'s true. I was amazed at how often a serious discussion will crop up and everyone around chimes in with their opinion and it\'s just cool.  The food\'s good.  I\'m tired of paying for everything I do here. I don\'t know where to get my hair cut. I have 0 concentration tonight. I am slug.  People are assertive at making friends here. It\'s so easy to make friends. They just introduce themselves.  Oh, my pen is stopping again. Why am I so tired?  A new page and nothing to say.  I don\'t want to play intramurals. My mind is spinning. What else to write about?  Twenty minutes is over.  I like college because I can take an art history class or fencing, or under-water basket weaving. There wasn\'t anything like that in high school.   I have to do my wa    Okay, now that the dramatics are over, let\'s be more realistic.  I am scared today.

'    Outgoing. The main thing college has done has made me outgoing. It is much easier to go up to someone I\'ve never seen before and just start a conversation for no reason other than I thought I\'d like to meet the person. I don\'t know anyone, no one knows me and so whatever impression I make on them now is what counts. It\'s so much easier and I feel so much more relaxed that I have to feel good about being away from anyone I know. At least, for a while. Just walking outside dressed in some obnoxious clothes or wearing a funny little beanie and not caring about who sees me and what they think is something that makes me feel good. If I see someone looking at me funny as I walk towards them, I\'m outgoing and self-confident enough to say, \"Hi, how ya\' doing?\" with my head held high and a smile on my face. This has to be done to survive in college. If I hadn\'t been forced to meet new people, which I really wasn\'t in high school or grade school, I would probably be walking around alone on the campus.  Before I came here I almost never greeted someone on the street I didn\'t know. They didn\'t know me, I wouldn\'t see them again, why should I say anything? Now after seeing tons of people my age all around me, if I see someone coming towards me I figure, \"Hey, I wonder what this guy\'s like. I should meet him. He looks like a neat guy.\" So I\'ll start talking to them (if they say something back, that is.) I also figure that these other college people are probably the same way I am, that they want to meet people.  College is a study in the unexpected. I want to do well, I work hard, I expect to do well, and I choke. If I relax and take life easy and don\'t do a damn thing, I get by with ease. I can\'t expect anything now. Life is far too weird. So is school. I don\'t know if the person who I\'m going to meet who looks cool will be, If the test I thought I aced I\'ll get an Aa on, if my \"superb paper I wrote will get the grade I want.      The whole reason I\'m here at a college out of my home state with only 2 or 3 people I previously knew is to get away.  God!  It feels good.  No one knew me when I came.  I could do what I wanted when I wanted and no one would look at me as if I was doing something I normally wouldn\'t.  They just think that is the way I am.  Freedom is a really nice thing to have, you know?  I wanted to get away from it all.  All the hassles, the predictability of the same place I\'ve always lived at.  Not just for a little while, but for long enough so I had no recent or vivid memories of my home town.  If I\'m never on my own, I\'ll never grow up.  Not that I dislike being childish, careless, and walking around mindlessly.  That can be fun.  I do that here, too, but I now have a chance to let go of the apron strings and be responsible.  How sick can you get of doing the same old things with the same old people about whom you know almost everything?  Pretty damn sick.  I want to meet some people who are unpredictable and hard to understand.  The complex people like that are at college.  Those who go straight into trades can\'t be very complex if they already know what they want to do.  It\'s all for me.  I came to college so I could be free, be happy, meet people.  I didn\'t come because my family would have been disappointed if I hadn\'t.  It wasn\'t because teachers and counselors thought I should.  I told those people, \"I\'m going to college.\"  No one forced me to do it.  I wanted to.  It was the first real decision I made.  And now I can make more.  I think about that and my gut clenches with a feeling like, \"Yeah,  Damn straight we\'re gonna do it.  It\'s our life, man.\"  And when my gut tightens like that I know I\'ve done something right.  I\'ve got my chance to be on top of my life, in control, not dependent on someone else\'s decisions.  I can act however I want to, and it\'s only here that I have that chance.  No one made me do this.  I did it all on my own.  I got here on my own.  I\'m independent now.  At least, as independent as I care to be.  It\'s my own c    Outgoing.

When you\'re forced to be on your own, you learn a lot about yourself. I finally found out that I have a lot harder time faking it amongst people because I don\'t know them.  I want to be accepted as normal, but have the leeway to be eccentric and act how I want.  My whole life I\'ve tried to make good impressions on everyone so they like me. It always pissed me off when no one really talked with me because they thought I was fake or arrogant.  Now I get here, I\'m not around my family or people who have known me for all my life, and now I can finally relax and be myself and not worry about what mom and dad will think. It doesn\'t matter, because no one knows what I\'m doing except me.  And what happens? People like me. I\'m not super talkative, trying to impress people, I\'m just relaxed, easy going, and me.  I\'m finally liking the way I get along with people. When people I know see me, they smile. It\'s not one of those facetious smiles saying, \"Hi, have a nice day.\" It`s \"Hey, he\'s a cool guy. I like him.\"  I have to feel better about myself when that happens. I can talk to those girls who I want to talk to, and not worry.

'  The first thing that comes to mind when I think about college and what university life is about is the great chance for the experience of new and exciting ideas, people, and actions. However, I think that some of the ideals I held when I first came to SMU have been shattered somewhat. I believed that the experiences in a classroom full of intelligent people would be a great mind opening time. The reality is that I have to search long and hard for a moment in my college life which I would consider to have changed my life in some unimaginable way. The chance to meet new and interesting people was also one of my perceptions of what college is about, but the pressure of making new friends and trying to form some bond of understanding makes it difficult on my life when I have to balance that with keeping my grades up and trying to find what and who I am and what I want to do with the rest of my life. The search for a good time was also one of my goals, but when is there time if all I can juggle is eating, sleeping, and studying?  When it comes down to it, college life is not all what it\'s cut out to be. However, there are a great number of opportunities to become involved in the university, but I\'m not sure that it would be worthwhile.    What am I going to do with my life? Every time I ponder on this question I get more and more confused. For the first time in my entire existence I am really in control of my destiny, with no guidance from my mom and dad or even a structured pattern in which I have to follow, and yet I seem to have no sense of purpose. The choices are many: what will be my major, what course do I want to take, do I want a liberal arts degree, or a more specified concentration in my major, and the choices continue. What about after college? Do I want to get a masters and continue my education, or just jump right into the real world? These decisions are going to affect me for the rest of my life. How do I know I\'m making the right decisions? I feel a sense of urgency about the whole thing and it seems as if my life is just \"passing right before my eyes\". I sometimes feel I\'m losing control of everything just when I should be confident of myself. Just to end up on a positive note, I just want to say that I think I\'m gaining valuable experience in how to cope with stress and learn to solve my problems in a mature way.   The semester is now almost over so where do I go from here? I ask myself. for sure my lifestyle is very different from what it was before I came to college. One emotional aspect that has really changed is my view on society. At first I thought I might want to be part of a group like in high school where I had my own clique of friends, but now because of the people I have met and what I perceived, real or unreal, as arrogance or plain obtrusiveness, I now emphasize myself as an individual first, with hopefully a tight, small circle of friends whom I would trust. Life is very funny, once you can be on top of the world and next feel like the dirt off of someone\'s shoe. I guess I\'ll first have to enjoy the good and cope with the bad. Perhaps in a few years, with better perspective I can better judge about how my life has gone.

I ask myself. for sure my lifestyle is very different from what it was before I came to college. One emotional aspect that has really changed is my view on society. At first I thought I might want to be part of a group like in high school where I had my own clique of friends, but now because of the people I have met and what I perceived, real or unreal, as arrogance or plain obtrusiveness, I now emphasize myself as an individual first, with hopefully a tight, small circle of friends whom I would trust.

Perhaps in a few years, with better perspective I can better judge about how my life has gone. Right now, I\'ll just \"go with the flow\" as they say and hope for the best.     What am I going to do with my life? Every time I ponder on this question I get more and more confused. For the first time in my entire existence I am really in control of my destiny, with no guidance from my mom and dad or even a structured pattern in which I have to follow, and yet I seem to have no sense of purpose. The choices are many: what will be my major, what course do I want to take, do I want a liberal arts degree, or a more specified concentration in my major, and the choices continue. What about after college? Do I want to get a masters and continue my education, or just jump right into the real world? These decisions are going to affect me for the rest of my life. How do I know I\'m making the right decisions? I feel a sense of urgency about the whole thing and it seems as if my life is just \"passing right before my eyes\". I sometimes feel I\'m losing control of everything just when I should be confident of myself. Just to end up on a positive note, I just want to say that I think I\'m gaining valuable experience in how to cope with stress and learn to solve my problems in a mature way.   The first thing that comes to mind when I think about college and what university life is about is the great chance for the experience of new and exciting ideas, people, and actions. However, I think that some of the ideals I held when I first came to SMU have been shattered somewhat. I believed that the experiences in a classroom full of intelligent people would be a great mind opening time. The reality is that I have to search long and hard for a moment in my college life which I would consider to have changed my life in some unimaginable way. The chance to meet new and interesting people was also one of my perceptions of what college is about, but the pressure of making new friends and trying to form some bond of understanding makes it difficult on my life when I have to balance that with keeping my grades up and trying to find what and who I am and what I want to do with the rest of my life. The search for a good time was also one of my goals, but when is there time if all I can juggle is eating, sleeping, and studying?  When it comes down to it, college life is not all what it\'s cut out to be. However, there are a great number of opportunities to become involved in the university, but I\'m not sure that it would be worthwhile.',3,-3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.12,0,3.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.06,Male20b

He abused his power as a teacher by calling me a lowlife, cowardly, spineless person in front of 100 people including my best friend and my girlfriend. I felt like what he called me, and all I wanted was revenge or justice. Anyway, my eyes are surging out of my head like snakes. Oh, but by the way, Michelle Colder turns me on. She is hot. Just wanted to let her know. I feel as if college is a waste of time, but then I realize that it is for my own good and vital to my future. My emotions? Love to me is my girlfriend. I just wish that I could know if this is really something special or does it get better or is it all unimportant.

A girlfriend is a good thing because it is an investment in your future. I see dinosaurs outside the window. Sad, is when I guess that I\'m not really ever sad.

I feel that going to college has been an official breaking of ties to my childhood and barriers restricting my freedom. The increased responsibility of coming to college especially from a small town has made me stop and rethink my position very often. I wonder if I picked the right college. I wonder if my intended major is what I\'ll be doing in 10 years. I am really in search for myself. I keep seeming to find revelations of thought sweeping over me. I am forming a closer relationship with God and I am getting involved in the Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. I feel that God has helped me to make the transition to increased responsibility.

I am learning more about God through my girlfriend and she is helping me along the path to being a better christian. Although, I feel that I have corrupted her.  College is the beginning of the rest of my life and a lot of serious thought must go into making those decisions which are vital to my future. I am being subjected to many things that try to entice me to believe their ways. I am using the excuse of the college transition to change some of my goals, desires, and plans. I feel that some people will fall subject to wrong beliefs and I just hope that God will pull them through. I have realized that life would be a waste without a family and the church.

'    I feel I owe my parents a lot. I\'m really happy that they care so much about me that they\'ll spend $13,000 a yr to send me here. They spent so much time with me last year filling out forms and making calls. This means so much to them. I love them, and just don\'t want to let them down. I\'m really upset about my grades, I\'m doing fine, but there are so many tests, and they are so hard! When I make a B, it should be an A. I\'m getting really run down but I know I have to keep going at it.  I\'ve already formed some special bonds of love and friendship. Which might have stemmed from the fact that we were all feeling alone and lost when we got here. The friends I have here really keep me going. They never let you be in a bad mood, they really care, and I care so much about them.  Right now I\'m trying to get everyone to like me. Even if I\'m being fake, but it is very important to me that I feel well liked and at home here. I already do feel like this is home.  I\'m worried about if I\'ve changed at all since I\'ve been here. What are my parents and friends back home going to think. I think I\'ve changed for the better.  One thing I really miss is my cat, Brandi. He is almost as old as me, and I miss him so much. I\'m looking forward to seeing him as much as my parents.  Sometimes I feel like I\'m taking the final step before the \"real world.\" I\'m scared, but I know I\'ll be prepared. I look at college as a fun final step. It would be nice if we had more t    College has made me a more emotional person. I think I always took the people I love for granted. Now thAT i\'m here I realize everything I had. I can tell people my feelings easier, and I show affection easier.  I\'m somewhat afraid that I\'m becoming too dependent on some people here at SMU. Like I\'m trying to find a replacement for my family. I\'m at the point where I won\'t go places without these people. Now I\'m starting to want to be alone more. Just so I can be by myself.  I\'m afraid that I\'m going to disappoint my parents when they see my grades. I know how they talked about my brother when he didn\'t do well, and I don\'t wany them to do that to me. They expect me to do very well. I never got along with my one sister (2nd oldest) I think she\'s hoping that I\'ll do bad. My parents will probably say that I don\'t work hard enough, when I really do. I don\'t want sympathy from them, just understanding.  Most of the times, I try not to think of home. If I do, I know I\'ll start to miss it. As long as I put it out of my mind, I`m OK. I\'ve had a lot of chances to go home, I live 3 1/2 hrs. away, but I don\'t go.  I get angry when I see othet kids doing better than me. This place is so competitive. Everyone is always trying to do better, and get higher grades.

My brothers and sisters went so therefore, I should go.  I\'m not upset about it, actually I\'m glad my parents pushed it so much, it was the right decision.  I really thought that I would be more homesick than I am, I feel really close to my mom especially, and thought that there would be times when I would cry or feel really lonely.  I have adjusted in that aspect as well.  In highschool I was always the smartest or one of the smartest in my class.  I was well known and did well.  Here, everyone was \"the smartest in their class.\"  It\'s hard for me to not be above others in intelligence.  My grades aren\'t as good, and I\'m afraid of what my parents and sister thinks.  I feel guilty because I haven\'t missed my friends that much.  They are all still in high school and I feel as if I\'ve matured.  I love them and still rely on them, but I\'ve made new friends that I\'m just as close to.  Sometimes, I wish I could just leave everything here and go back to them where it was so much easier.  When I do feel this way, I think, just 4 more years and I\'ll be an electrical engineer making $30,000.  Money has played an importance on the career I chose.  I want to do just as well as my parents did, if not better.  I feel that the most important part of going off to college is becoming independent.  I don\'t really want to let go, but I know I have to.  I hope that becoming independent doesn\'t mean that I am going to lose my parents because I love them a lot.  Doing well in college is important because I know it well please them and they\'ll be happy for me.  I miss the security of home.  I always had someone there for me.  Someone to answer all my questions and help me with all my problems.  I\'m afraid of growing up, I want to, but I\'m only 17 and to me, being grown up is about 25.  I feel like I\'m still a child.  I miss home, but I never dwell on the fact that I\'m not there, I\'ve learned to accept it.  College has made me a more emotional person. I think I always took the people I love for granted.

'    The good thing about college is that it\'s a place where no one knows who you are and you can \"start off new.\" Back in highschool everyone knew who you were, how you acted etc. If there was something you didn\'t like about yourself, it wasn\'t easy to change it because people knew you would be doing it. Now that I\'m in college, no one knows what I was like in highschool, how I acted, what I wore etc. NOw I have a chance to change myself and no one will say anything about. In highschool, I was popular but I had a reputation of not being a good date because I \"didn\'t treat guys well\". I was more of a follower, I wasn\'t too outgoing and I had to live down my \"derelect\" years when I was a sophomore. Now that I\'m in college, I\'ve become more of a leader, out of my new group of friends I\'m more of the initiator. No one knows of my past experiences with guys etc and I\'m able to change myself for the better. One thing that really worried me about going to SMU was that I\'d be living with a bunch of snobs, everyone would flaunt their money and that I wouldn\'t make friends. I\'ve had the same friends for 13 yrs. I really haven\'t had to make friends since then. Now that I\'ve been here for a month, I see that my fears didn\'t come true. I\'ve made some really great friends and we\'ve become extremely close for only knowing each other for a month. In ways they\'re better friends than I had at home. At home I never revealed my true emotions to anyone, I kept all my problems inside and tried to work them out myself. I\'ve told my \"new\" friends things about myself that I\'ve never told anyone before. It\'s part of my plan of \"changing\" myself. Another thing that worried me was the fact that I was still a virgin and never did drugs (although I do drink). Out of all 12 of my good friends in high school I was one of 3 that were virgins. I\'m not ashamed of the fact, but it still bothered me that maybe everyone I lived with wasn\'t. As it turns out the 4 really good friends I\'ve made here are virgins also. It\'s so neat how we can talk about guys and what we have not done etc. I never did that with my friends at home because it seemed like they always ridiculed me and put me down.  To me sex is something that shouldn\'t be taken lightly. I know girls who would get drunk and do it and not even think twice about it. Sure I\'ve been with guys when I\'ve been drunk, but I\'ve never gone that far. I\'m sure I\'ll probably lose my virginity in college but I want it to be something meaningful, not just a use and abuse type situation. My best friend in high school had a steady boyfriend for 2 years and I guess I would say I was jealous of her. I was prettier, better grades, cheerleader, better dancer. Everything we did I was better at. Then, towards the end of high school she was more popular, got homecoming queen, steady boyfriend etc, but I still had better grades, better homelife, more money etc. So I guess I really shouldn    Overall, college is what I expected it to be. The first couple of weeks that I was here, I had a blast! But these past 2 weeks I\'ve been in such a deep depression. I don\'t know if it\'s the workload, missing family and friends, lack of sleep or what. I can\'t pin point what it is but I\'m just always sad and on the verge of tears. I just want to go home for a couple of days and remember what life used to be like. I can\'t even imagine sleeping in my room, seeing my parents, or eating \"real\" food. I feel real scared and alone right now. I guess it\'s just because I know that how my life used to be will never be that way again. Right now all I can think about is doing well on my tests and finishing my computer program that I\'ve worked on for 6 hours (and it still doesn\'t work). Although college life may seem easier on the surface, it really isn\'t. Although I don\'t have chores or errands to run, etc, it is still harder. All I have to do is worry about me but that brings on a lot of responsibility. Whatever happens to me is because of me and my actions. I guess the pressure is just getting to me. My mood swings here are very frequent. At one point, I\'m happy, glad that I\'m here, having the best time, and then all of the sudden I hate it, I want to go home etc. I know every freshman goes through this, but it\'s just new to me. I\'m a long way from home and I feel like if anything happens to me no one will care because no one here loves me and feels a need to watch over me. Since I\'m the baby in the family, I\'m used to attention and here, no one really cares. Plus, parents weekend is next week and my parents can\'t come down, so I\'ll really be depressed. But I know I have enough strength (inner) to get through my \"crisis\" and college will turn out to be everything I expected it to be. A place where I can learn about myself and who I am, be totally selfish, learn about life (by trial and error) and be taught a particular discipline. All the best friends of my life are here. If I could get away from my feelings of terror, lonliness, uncertainty and confusion, I\'d be one happy camper! I don\'t want to forget my high school friends etc. I\'ll make new ones here, but I just keep remembering all the fun I had and I keep saying how can anything top that? I just wish I knew more about myself and who I am, then maybe I\'d understand all my conflicting feelings, my problems etc. I\'d be able to work them out and be happy all the time like     At first thought, I believed college was going to be a fun, exciting  experience. Now that I\'m here though, I find it\'s not all that way. This is the first time I\'ve been away from home, and although I\'ve met a lot of new friends, sometimes I feel like I am all alone, that I am living with a bunch of strangers and no one really knows who I am or what I am about. Living in my dorm is fun, but I feel like I always have to act like someone I`m really not just so people will like me. At home I would get in bad moods and be bitchy to my family, but I feel I can not do that here because then everyone always says you\'re a bitch and talks behind your back. There are moments when I am having the best time and love college, but this past week has been the worst. I feel like going in my room and crying because I miss home, my friends and the way life used to be. Here, I am responsible for myself, make my own decisions, do what I want to do and when, but it\'s just such a scary feeling. Even the classes are nerve racking. In each class I have maybe 4 tests so if I fail one of them, I\'m in big trouble. And my parents expect at least a 3/0 and I don\'t want to let them down. In high school I was an Aa student and so far I\'m not doing too hot in college. There\'s so much pressure on me to get good grades, make new friends, to get involved and still keep some sense of my life in order. I feel there\'s not enough time in each day to do all I need to do. Living with a roomate isn\'t too much fun either. I am an easy going person who gets along with everyone. I have never gotten into a major fight with any of my friends before, but my roomate is driving me crazy! She\'s the biggest bitch in the world, flirts with all the guys and constantly complains that I am touching her things. I don`t know what to say to her because I have to live with her for the rest of the year and I don\'t want it to be too strained. When I feel down and depressed I always look at my photo album, yearbook, etc, and it makes me feel a little better. I miss my parents so much but when I call them they seem to get on my nerves. I don\'t know why. My mom and I are really close and I miss doing things with her. She really misses me, too. The other day she called me up to tell me about her new hair style. I thought it was cute! Just today I talked to my friend and she was saying how she went home and saw a whole bunch of people. I was sorta jealous but I know I\'ll see everyone at Christmas! I\'ve always found it really hard to write my emotions down or say what I\'m feeling. I don\'t know why though. I feel a lot of things but I don\'t know how to formulate them in my mind. Right now, the shock of college and the different lifestyle and environment is still there. I\'m not used to it yet, but I\'m sure once I am I will be able to get a grip on myself. I came to college to.    At first thought, I believed college was going to be a fun, exciting  experience. Now that I\'m here though, I find it\'s not all that way. This is the first time I\'ve been away from home, and although I\'ve met a lot of new friends, sometimes I feel like I am all alone, that I am living with a bunch of strangers and no one really knows who I am or what I am about.

I feel like going in my room and crying because I miss home, my friends and the way life used to be. Here, I am responsible for myself, make my own decisions, do what I want to do and when, but it\'s just such a scary feeling. Even the classes are nerve racking. In each class I have maybe 4 tests so if I fail one of them, I\'m in big trouble. And my parents expect at least a 3/0 and I don\'t want to let them down. In high school I was an Aa student and so far I\'m not doing too hot in college. There\'s so much pressure on me to get good grades, make new friends, to get involved and still keep some sense of my life in order. I feel there\'s not enough time in each day to do all I need to do. Living with a roomate isn\'t too much fun either. I am an easy going person who gets along with everyone. I have never gotten into a major fight with any of my friends before, but my roomate is driving me crazy! She\'s the biggest bitch in the world, flirts with all the guys and constantly complains that I am touching her things. I don`t know what to say to her because I have to live with her for the rest of the year and I don\'t want it to be too strained. When I feel down and depressed I always look at my photo album, yearbook, etc, and it makes me feel a little better. I miss my parents so much but when I call them they seem to get on my nerves. I don\'t know why. My mom and I are really close and I miss doing things with her. She really misses me, too. The other day she called me up to tell me about her new hair style. I thought it was cute! Just today I talked to my friend and she was saying how she went home and saw a whole bunch of people. I was sorta jealous but I know I\'ll see everyone at Christmas! I\'ve always found it really hard to write my emotions down or say what I\'m feeling. I don\'t know why though. I feel a lot of things but I don\'t know how to formulate them in my mind. Right now, the shock of college and the different lifestyle and environment is still there. I\'m not used to it yet, but I\'m sure once I am I will be able to get a grip on myself. I came to college to.',4,-5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.13,2.56,0,1.28,0,1.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.11,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,2.13,0,0,0,0,0,1.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.85,0,3.41,0.85,2.56,0,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.41,Female20b
'  The one thing that seems to be the biggest change in my life since I started attending college has been my relationship with my family. I still live at home. Before coming to college my mom and I were like best friends, we were so close. We are still close, but we argue a lot now. About stupid stuff. I still live by high school rules! It bothers me that my friends, living at home or at school, don\'t have curfews. they can go where ever they want and don\'t have to answer to anyone. My mom and I seem to fight constantly about the same things each time. Sometimes I think I hate her. I know I can\'t because I loved her so much before.  My dad and i are another story. We are so much alike. We both have to have the last word in any argument. He works at SMU so I go see him every day on my lunch break. Those few minutes a day are great. We\'re both smiling, actually talking and not yelling, but when he comes home from work, if I\'m not in my room with the door closed and studying, then according to him I \"haven\'t done anything all day.\" It\'s strange that I can kiss him on the cheek while he\'s working, but I never kiss him goodnight or even tell him goodnight. Most of our arguments are about money. I\'m trying to pay my way through school with as little help from them as possible. I don\'t work during school, so whenever I go out with friends I have to ask them for money. Granted, my dad worked at SMU for 22 years so I could go here, but that\'s why I want to pay the rest myself. Sometimes I think that I should take a semester off and work so I could get out from under their roof. That way I could do what I wanted with my money.  My brother and I have gotten closer. After a yelling match about money he came in and told me not to get discouraged. That\'s what he did. He went to SMU for 2 years and UTD for 1. He offered to help me pay for next semester if I would just continue.     I want to retract what I said last night about sometimes hating my mom. I heard a song on my way over here tonight called \"Dear Mr Jesus\" (on Y95) and it is about abused children. I cried through the entire song and realized that my situation could be worse and that I really do love my mom.  Now that that\'s over with, another major change for me was not knowing anyone. Sure 8 people from my high school that graduated with me are going here, but they live here and have made friends of their own. I remember the 1st day of Orientation. I came home and told my mom that I was never going back. She asked me to give SMU another chance, so I did. I feel so alone at school. I think that because I commute, I\'m never going to meet people who will turn into good friends. Right now I have 2 close friends that I go out with. That makes weekends easy because I go out with one, one night and one the other. But the one who is my best friend got back together with her boyfriend and has completely forgotten me. I like Richard, but I feel like I\'m only a part time friend.  Sometimes if I could get back together with an old boyfriend, things would be better, but I seem to lose interest pretty fast. My most recent date was with an \"ex\" about 3 weeks ago. That was the 1st date with anyone since Feb. Sure I went to my prom with a guy who might as well have been my brother. My mom says, \"Give it time,\" but I\'m running out of patience. The guys I\'ve met at SMU have been really nice, for the most part, but I see them in class and that\'s it for a couple of days because I go home and leave school behind. Maybe I\'m not datable or friendly enough. I don\'t know! Walking across campus, it seems that everyone is \"pre-coupled\". Kindof like the Tootsie Roll commercial where everything becomes a Tootsie roll. I have to remind myself that there are people here who don\'t have a boyfriend or girlfriend. Maybe a boyfriend isn\'t what I need. It may be that I want someone to be a good friend to me like Ami who left a big void in my social life by restricting me to go out only one night with Kami. I guess I\'ll just give it time and maybe something will happen.     I want to retract what I said last night about sometimes hating my mom.

I guess I\'ll just give it time and maybe something will happen.     The past 2 nights I haven\'t given you my feelings. I\'ve implied them, but not stated. So, here goes!  I\'m angry because I\'m alone here and that makes me a little depressed. I\'m glad that I\'m not in high school, but I\'m scared about my future here. I\'ve gotten very emotional since August. I snap at everyone when giving answers to simple questions like what I want to eat for dinner. I\'m disgusted with my grades because I\'ve never had to study really, and I\'m edgy about finals! But most of all, I\'m afraid of disappointing my family and myself. I\'ve had one cousin go here for one year, my brother only made it through 2, so I\'m the family\'s last shot.  I guess that`s why we often argue because I want them to ease up on the pressure, but they don\'t really pressure me, I do.  I\'m jealous of Ami (the friend with a boyfriend) because she has Richard, she goes to a Jr college and doesn\'t do anything there. I practically wrote one of her papers for English and she got an A (95 to be exact). She only goes to school 3 days a week. It seems that I\'m over here busting my butt for not even half way decent grades and she doesn\'t do anything and is having a \"grand ole\" time! I\'m missing out on something. Something\'s not right with this picture.  I made a deal with my mom that because I\'m not working nor do I have money to spend, I would do housework when I get home from school for her to buy Christmas presents for my family from me. I think that will make my life easier at home because I\'m putting an effort to not do anything to cause an argument.  I try to act like nothing\'s wrong in my life, but I think that\'s what causes my anxiety and this strange combination of emotions. I don\'t like myself right now, and I don\'t like my attitude about school, friends and family. I guess I\'ll just wait this out and like the song says, \"I\'ve gotta have Faith!\"    The past 2 nights I haven\'t given you my feelings.

'    Change - that\'s what I\'m really feeling, leaving behind my parents, friends and hometown. It\'s a tough adjustment to make sometimes. Sitting alone in your room is the worst. You tend to think about home more than usual. Actually, I\'m adjusting well. I am semi-confident about making my 3/0 this semester, but overall, I am doing much better than most. I think my parents are having the hardest time with this move. They live 8 hours away, so it\'s not easy for them. My dad couldn\'t even speak to me for almost 1 week. He would just cry so I could never talk to him. He\'s the one I miss the most. In fact, I don\'t miss too many things or people because there\'s always something to do or someone to talk to here. Acceptance - I think that is my (and most everyone else\'s) biggest fear. Some people can be very crude and rude. Other\'s are just plain mean. I think it\'s because they don\'t like freshmen for some reason. I think they are just being childish. No mature senior would ever treat freshmen the way they do now. I guess this says a lot about one\'s maturity. Rejection is another big fear. Not only with groups, but with individuals. Why some people act the way they do is beyond me. No one likes rejection, so why do people reject their peers?  Who knows? I also don\'t understand why I don\'t miss my friends and boyfriend the way others do. I guess it\'s because I\'ve met so many new people that I haven\'t had the chance to miss them too much. In fact, unfortunately, none at all. I can now understand why people say that the friends you make in college are the one\'s you keep forever. It\'s definitely different living with other people all of the time. Change - that\'s what it\'s all about!    The future. good question. I believe my future here at smu to be very bright, especially if things keep continuing the way they have been. Classes are getting by slowly, and all the professors try to get you to pursue their courses to major in. It\'s funny how they all say what courses their course comes before. For example, \"My course is the basis on which the next course is built.\" There are so many options in classes, degrees, majors, minors, everything else. How does one decide, who knows! The possibilities are endless. there are some things that you can tell from the first week here, though. One thing I can tell is that I\'m not cut out for economics. I mean it\'s horribly boring. In fact I changed teachers because I thought it was him that was almost putting me to sleep, but it turns out my new teacher does it to me too, and I\'m not the only one. That does make me feel better. Sleep keeps popping into my head. That\'s one thing Mom andDad are good at doing is telling you to go to bed. Heck, everyone I know it seems goes out on school nights. Never! I\'m about to fall asleep and all I did last night was talk to people in the TV lounge until 12:30. How some people do it, I\'ll never know. Like I\'ve said before, at least I\'m not the only one. Gosh, what a cop out! Oh, it seems like I\'m thinking in slow motion today or something. It\'s like my mind is blank. No matter how hard I try, I can\'t think of anything to say about my topic. I can\'t really think of anything to say about anything actually. I guess it\'s a form of writers block, a very different form I might add.    Leaving home. It\'s a tough decision to make. you leave your friends, family, home and relationships all behind you just for the pursuit of a better life education-wise than you were being dealt. It\'s not easy to pick a college either. There are so many pros and cons to them all. So you wind up choosing SMU for assorted reasons and you end up here. What happens next is up to you, but coping with this change in surroundings can be a lot more difficult than you imagined. The funny thing is why some people loathe the idea of leaving home, and they are the ones who end up missing home the least. All year I kept thinking how horrible it was going to be when I left. Don\'t get me wrong, I love SMU, but leaving home was tough. Now, I don\'t even really miss home. My home is now here, and believe you me, my new \"family\" is a million times larger than my real family. I thought it would be hard to adjust, but I love it already. Being here only one week so far is not bad. You can always count on seeing a friendly face around. In fact, today someone asked me if I knew the entire school. The funny thing is, that person was an upperclassman. Strange, but I have to admit it was an awesome feeling always having someone tell you, \"Hi,\" practically every 10 feet!  Acceptance, that\'s what it\'s all about. Without the fear of rejection, you can go as far as anyone else, even farther. Now everyone knows that there\'s a difference between a \"hello,\" and a friend, but what a better place to start. Things are going well here. My new friends, even my roommate is ok (except when she stays out past 1am when I have an 8:00am class!) It is strange how people can adjust to living with new people so easily. I never thought I would. It\'s too bad that a lot of guys treat me like \"one of the guys\" or else I\'d be going out all the time. But hey, that is probably a blessing in disguise. I\'m trying to think of other feelings I\'ve had (especially since I ran out of things to say yesterday) but these are all I can think of. Like I said yesterday - change.

'    I like being at college. I do get homesick sometimes, but I\'m really having fun. It\'s exciting to me, too looking forward to going home. I\'m glad I\'m not in the same city as my parents. It would be too hard to stay away and become independent and grow up! It\'s fun to get to go visit home! I haven\'t seen my parents since I left (end of August) and I actually think it\'s strengthened our relationship! I think my mom\'s actually grown up some. (And of course so have I.) I might be going home at the end of Oct, but maybe not until Thanksgiving.  It\'s hard for me to get used to staying up so late. MWF in my 1:00 French class (2nd semester 1st year) I just about fall asleep and the professor speaks all french which my brain does not comprehend very well when I\'m so tired.  The food is also disgusting. it all tastes alike! I think I\'m losing weight, though which is worth it.  My roommate is great, but her \"friend boyfriend,\" (she\'s not sure which she wants it to be. Really boyfriend, but he buys her love) drives me crazy!  He\'s kind of dweebish only his terrible insecurity in himself makes him kind of dweebish, though. He could be cool. He and my roommate go to dinner and after she comes up to the room he goes to his (right down the hall) the minute she walks in the door the phone rings and it\'s him! He worships her so much that he totally ignores others and is quite rude to everyone else. Total asshole.  I\'m very lucky my boyfriend is very polite (to me and others as well).  This is getting off the subject, but it\'s how I feel. These are my deep emotions on going to college.  Yesterday, I was writing about my boyfriend. We haven\'t gotten along as well this past month because of the transition to college, but I believe it\'s over. I\'m settled in, have friends and know what my teachers expect from me. I feel more secure and can relax. We had a talk the other night about all the tension of being here, first year and everything. He wasn\'t being very understanding with me (for the 1st month here at school). He knew what it was like to be a freshman it was terrible for him, so I guess he didn\'t want to go through it again through me. He probably didn\'t want to feel those feelings again. Which I don\'t blame him! Last weekend just seemed like a turning point. Everything started feeling normal and like home.  Last night was great. I had my first home cooked meal since Aug, whole wheat rice, corn on the cob, and chicken and french bread. Yumm! I bet you\'re getting hungry reading this! I am! Now I have to go eat in the awful student center!     I\'m not sure what I want to do after college.  Before, I was going to be a doctor. My parents didn\'t push me, I just showed an interest so they encouraged me.  In the last few yrs I had thought about it and all the chem, biol, and physics classes and I realized that I really didn\'t want to be a doctor! I was just thinking of something that would be fairly easy. Those are my easiest subjects, but not really what I like.  (I\'m tying this in with the subject.)  I\'m really interested in many things. I\'m not the person who loves history period. I like it all. I feel like I\'m never learning enough and I feel like I was deprived in High school. I\'m so glad to be at college, you get to take so many things, and you get to take classes you love, something you\'d pay to see (even though you actually are paying) even if you didn\'t have to take the class.  i\'ve always loved art classes or thought I could seriously major in it, but I think that`s what I\'m going to do, why not? I love it. It\'s really what I\'m interested in.  Today I actually liked my lunch in the student center. I had a sandwich, wheat bread, philly cream cheese, lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, mushrooms, tomatoes. Try it, it\'s great!  One thing I don\'t like about SMU is not enough holidays. I guess SMU isn\'t strict compared to some places, but I feel like I\'m being babysat sometimes. I shouldn\'t complain because it\'s really not that bad, it\'s the SA\'s on my floor that are bad and they live next door to my room.  I think I wrote this yesterday, but I know that if I had been writing this 1st session I could have written something different. I was depressed and sad at 1st, but it\'s over with. I\'m sure I have written some \"signs\" of depression or sadness in the last 3 days, but it was just the \"left-overs\" that I hadn\'t gotten out of my system.     I\'m not sure what I want to do after college.

Before I came to college I thought it was going to be great. make new friends, be with my boyfriend and have fun! When I\'d really think about it I knew I\'d miss my mom very much. I\'ve moved from city to city all my life and instead of having close friends my age I\'m very colse to my mom. I wanted to go to college and get away from home.  Now that I\'m here I get mad sometimes. I wanted to go further away from home, out of state, but my parents wanted me to stay in state. In fact my father wanted me to go to UT, \"the best school in the Nation\" disgusting! there was no way. So we compromised, I\'m at SMU. So sometimes I get mad that I\'m not where I really want to be.  At first I hated it. My roommate was very weird. It really depressed me because if I was in my dorm room I\'d just get there and entertain myself because we had nothing to say to each other. I was coming to college to meet lots of friends and have great times with my roommate (and decorate our room together). Why wasn\'t it happening? I would walk around the dorm and stop by rooms of other girls. On the whole though, it was hard because I always felt left out since I\'d always be with 2 roomies and then just me.  Then, I switched rooms and my life changed! It\'s so much better now, We`re good friends. We have about the same taste in clothes, music, and politically. (Which is a good thing, I couldn\'t live with a Rep! Yuk.)  I get depressed about money a lot because I\'m so totally broke. That\'s really the thing that gets to me. I guess everyone feels that way, though. It only bothers me when I start getting worn out, no sleep. then I can\'t deal with things so rationally, blow them out of proportion.  Being here with my boyfriend (of 3 years) is really something to get used to! We have a great relationship. He`s my best friend, but being the same place as he is year round is really a change.     Before I came to college I thought it was going to be great. make new friends, be with my boyfriend and have fun!

'    Discussing new issues of why I came here is so hard. Boy, I wonder if I came for the right reasons. Well whatever they are it wasn\'t because the school was white. So my feeling of being prejudiced against didn\'t matter to me any because I knew what I wanted to accomplish and still do. My teachers said that, \"You will never be able to get the same kind of education as you would at a black school. That\'s probably true, race is a big issue for some people, but it isn\'t when it comes to me being somewhere where I\'m not a part of that face. I love being black at a predominantly white school. It\'s interesting especially since I\'ve been around blacks all my life. I get to see how white people think. Which to me in classes isn\'t worth a dime. I feel that I am one of the most expressive persons in this school. I feel very superior in class and performance. I let them know I am black and I am proud of it. I don\'t want to be any different. I love myself, my race, and coming here to me was a big step for my race in desegregating colleges. I feel we could all learn more by learning or at least trying everyone else\'s ways and cultures, and of course trying to understand each other. College here has made me want to prove myself even more. I feel a deep  every time I think about how some black people are prejudice against their own kind. I don\'t understand why parents raise their children like that, but it is sad. You sure don\'t see many white people wanting to be black. Well being here has shown me that I don\'t have to be in an all black setting to communicate freely, it is hard to do anyway. I mean people talk about (you) regardlessly of what you are. Color just gives them another word to call you. I know what I am, and I know what I hope to be, A credit to my race of course. It is kind of strange, you don\'t get to hear the band play \"live\" music like most (black) colleges do. Oh well, who said we came here for the band. I want these people to know that hey, don\'t give me the bull \"I know the deal,\" and believe me I won\'t forget. Coming here I think was a very big step in my life as well as career. I just want to be me, not to pretend to be someone else. I love myself. I may get angry sometimes, but I love myself. Thank you Jesus, thank you so much. It is truly a dream come true. I never forget you have done for me, never. As long as I live. I\'ll know my maker, who to give credit to, who to praise. Unlike most others who come here for no other reasons but to look good, appear rich, and think we are something we\'re not. I know where I came from, tha    Now that I have written down most of my feelings on going to college, I don\'t know exactly how to feel. I do feel good about my decision, it was very wise. Looking back tremendously how I felt then as a child everything is so different. Life seems to just pick me up and I went from being a twelve year old to an eighteen year old. Many of my friends are just teenagers didn\'t make through school, either because they died, or they just dropped out. Life is so confusing sometimes. I\'m glad I\'m here at SMU. I\'m glad I made it this far and hope and pray to go further. Oh it is so scary. Being alone is so scary. Oh God people may think I\'m crazy, but what I believe in, it does not matter to me if they do or not. So much has happened that most people wouldn\'t understand. Now that I\'m here I\'m away from someone I love so much. Claude I miss you. He has brought so much joy to my life. As a child I remember always feeling different feeling alone. I learned soon enough that I wasn\'t, God was with me all the time, he was there. He made everything he ever wanted possible and he still is. My mom and I never really got along to well, I think it was because she and I were both very stubborn, but now it\'s so different. We talk on the phone and I miss her. I knew I would miss mom when I left, but not like I miss her now. I remember her saying all the time, it\'s hard being a grown up. She used to say she wish she was still a baby at home with her mom, with no problems. I understand why she says that in a very big way. I never was really spoiled except by my great-grandmother. The sweetest lady I ever knew. She died when I was twelve. Sometimes wonder what it would be like if she was here. Her and aunt of course. I miss my aunt Hattie too. I often find myself saying, Oh grandma if you could only see me now, would you be proud of me. I\'m sure she would. Now my life is in my hands as well, as God\'s. What will happen after here I don\'t know, I pray God knows, which I\'m sure he does. I love God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, Claude, my mom, my family. Thank you, so much, forever. School is great I love my life. I plan to future it with God, Jesus, the Holy Ghost, Claude, Mom, family, and of course my friends. I am truly thankful. I knew all along I was different. I just didn\'t know how different.    Oh boy, this was the hardest thing you\'ve ever done yet Toni. Leaving home. Oh, it wasn\'t as hard as I thought at first, but now things are different. Coming to this school has been truly just one of my greatest dreams. I am lonely though lots of times. I guess I can\'t help myself. I miss my friends, how we used to laugh. It all happened so quickly that now it\'s like it\'s so unreal. But I know it is. My knowledge and wisdom is so powerful sometimes I don\'t know what to do. Being black at a predominantly white school sure was a joke to my high school counselors, they don\'t think it\'s funny now. I got out here and proved to them that with God\'s help all things are possible. I miss my boyfriend more than anything. I don\'t know what\'s going on between me and my mother. It\'s like all of a sudden since I\'m out here we get along so much better, seeing that we were always at each other\'s throat. Now that I\'m here I\'m really concerned about the image I want to give. I don\'t want people thinking that I\'m not intelligent because I\'m black. I have made sure they don\'t. Being the only black student in most of my classes makes me feel that I have the most important role to play in the class. I express my opinions and so forth. I am very expressive anyway so even if it was all black nothing would stop me. Recalling how my Rhetoric 1 english teacher was trying to stumble over the words \"black people or minorities,\" made me want to laugh and feel sorry for ignorance in that. hey, I am black and proud of it. Some of us were just born the other way. It\'s fun though watching the looks on people\'s faces once they see I\'m not afraid to speak up. But I for some reason love this school. Why I don\'t know, but it\'s interesting watching white people trying to figure stuff out that I already know. Anyway school is an experience I\'m sure I\'ll never forget. I\'ts been fun so far and I do plan on leaving my mark on it for the good of \"my people\". Coming to college and leaving home has been, and is a good experience for everyone or at least for me. It\'s all so funny. You can\'t and won\'t get it from me but I will say this, School is life, we learn from not understanding it.\" I have no more to say on this subject of \"my experience of coming to college far away from home.\"    Oh boy, this was the hardest thing you\'ve ever done yet Toni.

'    I feel like I did a year ago today.  \"The new girl.\"  Only this time it\'s not a unique experience.  There are plenty of other people in the same boat.  But it seems like everyone around me has handled the situation so much better than I have.  Everyone else seems so calm, cool, collected.  These girls are all so poised.  They know what to wear, where to go, what to say.  I feel so frumpy.  I don\'t think there is any way I can measure up to them.  I think the fact that I feel so uncomfortable is showing.  I think people can tell. But I don\'t know how to keep it hidden.  And I don\'t know how to overcome my feelings.  I never seem to feel good about myself.  And I keep telling myself that I should take the attitude that I\'m me, so who cares what everyone alse says.  If they like me for me, that\'s fine.  If not, who cares. But I can\'t.  I feel betrayed too.  I was so sure the guy I like liked me too.  We\'ve been friends for about a month now I really thought he liked me as more than just a friend though.  I like him as more.  But I didn\'t want to wreck our friendship by telling him.  But then I told him.  He just wants to be friends.  It hurts.  I know that\'s just the way it goes, and at least we\'re still friends.  But it hurts because he\'s my friend and he let me down.  But it\'s my fault for trying to make something more of the friendship.  I don\'t want things to change between us, but I think they already have.  And I think he likes someone else.  If they get together, it\'s going to really be hard to be around them.  Maybe in time it\'ll be easier. But it hurts so much right now.  The worst part is that he\'s been the closest friend I\'ve had since coming here.  I talk to him about everything.  And now I don\'t know where to turn.  I feel like I really need to talk to someone.  I\'m just that way.  I need to talk about things that are bothering me. There isn\'t anyone here for me to do that with now.  Why did I mess things up?  I don\'t know what to write about.  I don\'t know what I feel about coming to college anymore. I just wish that I wasn\'t here. I mean, there are some fun times, but there have been some pretty bad times, too.  More bad than good, it seems.  I didn\'t want to go to college.  But my parents kept saying, \"What are you going to do for the rest of your life without a college degree?\"  Everyone expected me to come to college.  So here I am.  But why?  I don\'t want to go home, either, because I might miss out on something here.  I\'m so torn.  Why can\'t this be easier?  Why can\'t I make good grades, get enough sleep, make lots of friends, and be happy?  I just want to be happy.  I was so happy this summer. What happened to me?  This is so scary.  I\'m just numb all over now. I don\'t really feel anything but bad.  I feel all the bad emotions, depression, hurt, anger, sadness.  But the good ones just don\'t seem to come. At least not in large enough quantities.  I want to be happy.  Really happy.  I want to feel good about myself again.  But I just don\'t know how anymore. I just don\'t know.  I\'m always tired.  Always have a headache.  Always bored.  Nothing\'s interesting anymore.    I\'m supposed to write about my deepest emotions.  I\'m finding that extremely difficult.  Why?  Because I  don\'t feel like I have any more.  I did when I first came here.  Everything affected me emotionally.  But now, I feel like nothing does. I\'m numb.  It\'s frightening.  But it\'s not.  I mean, it bothers me, but not very much.  That\'s the whole problem now.  I don\'t feel angry anymore.  Or happy, or sad, or excited, or frightened, or anxious, nothing.  I have the barest traces of these feelings, but not often.  All I ever seem to feel is sleepy.  I don\'t understand.  I don\'t know what\'s wrong.  The worst part is that I want to feel these things.  I think I\'m afraid to, though.  I\'m afaid to let myself feel especially good things, because I\'m afraid of being disappointed.  Maybe that\'s it.  I mean, well I don\'t know what I mean.  I guess I just don\'t want to get my hopes up about anything.  I feel like I\'ve changed so much.  I used to be a fun person!  Now I feel like I bore the hell out of everyone.  I want to get out of this.  Because people don\'t like to be around boring people.  I just don\'t know how to let loose anymore.  I feel like I never laugh.  I have no self-confidence anymore, either. None.  I feel like everyone here is better than me.  Smarter, prettier, thinner, more talented, funnier, more fun to be around.  And when I step back and look at myself, I know other people can tell.  But I don\'t know how to get self-confidence.  You can\'t just wake up one morning and say, \"hey, I\'ll be self-confident today!\"  It just doesn\'t work.  I\'ve tried to see the good in me.  Nothing that would draw people to me.  I wish I knew what to do.  I have no confidence even in school work.  I have always been told I\'m smart.  My grades have always been above average.  But I\'ve never had to truly study.  Now all of a sudden, I have to.  It\'s not that I don\'t know how to study.  I just don\'t want to.  I have no desire to.  I get easily distracted.  I sit on my bed and stare at my toes, or watch my roommate\'s fan go.  For hours.  With the books opened right on my lap.  And an exam the next day.  I think I\'m flipping out.  No wonder people think I\'m weird.  The more I look at myself, the more I begin to wonder.  I forgot what I was going to say.  Now I\'m sitting here staring at the words on the paper, but not focusing on them.  My mind went totally blank.  This is so weird.  I\'m going to fail out of this school, I know it.  I have failed every exam I\'ve taken so far, I know it.  I get a lot of results back tomorrow.  I know I failed. There goes my scholarship!  I need to learn to pay attention.  To stop tuning out.  To look and to feel things again.  I don\'t want to be numb anymore!  I want to get excited over what\'s happening around me.  I think Scott likes me, and I like him.  But am I happy that I think he likes me?  No.  I don\'t want to get my hopes up, then be disappointed.  So I don\'t feel anything.      I think my biggest fears about coming to college have to do with people.  I have always been a very shy person.  I\'m petrified to go anywhere or do anything by myself, because I\'m afraid to talk to other people.  I\'m also afraid that because I\'m alone, people are going to think, \"God, what a loser. She has no friends.\"  So, when the time came to leave for school, I didn\'t want to go.  I didn`t want to be on my own.  I had no friends that were coming so SMU.  I was completely and utterly alone. And that\'s how I felt.  I still do.  Sometimes.  I miss my family a lot, which seems kindof stupid to me sometimes, since I only live about 45 minutes away.  But I miss them like crazy.  We\'ve always been really close.  I\'ve come to depend on them to always be there, and now they can\'t be.  The first couple of weeks especially were terrible.  I cried every night.  No more Mom and Dad to be there all the time to make things right.  It\'s time to grow up.  I\'m not ready.  I guess I have lived a sheltered life.  They  always tried to keep me protected from things and people that would hurt me.  I never really realized how much until now.  There`s a lot of cruel people in the world, and I\'m just now learning how really cruel they are. People make fun of me.  Because I\'m shy.  Because of the way I dress.  The music I listen to, the friends I have.  I don\'t get angry though.  I just get hurt.  I always seem to have my feeling hurt for some reason.  Maybe I look for it.  Send out signals or something.  It hurts so much.  I just want people to like me.  I want to have friends and fit in.  My parents say I try too hard.  A girl on my old floor told my I don\'t try hard enough.  So who\'s right?  I hate my old roommate.  She made my first month miserable.  She turned almost everyone on the floor against me.  I don\'t know everything she said, but I know some.  She told them all I ever do is study.  She said I was boring.  She told them I was gay!  I was really hurt by that.  I mean, it\'s stupid and immature, and definitely not true, but what if someone believes it?  What if a rumor starts because of it?  My whole life here could be ruined!  I can\'t believe she did that.  I always pictured my roommate and I as being the best of friends.  Talk about disappointment!  She is such a bitch!  I`m glad I finally got to switch.  I\'m much happier.  I have a new roommate, room, floor, and friends.  To hell with the rest of them!  I miss my friends back home.  I miss the one\'s in New York, where I used to live even more.  We\'re all so busy with school now that we never get to write or talk on the phone anymore.  I don\'t want to lose touch.  I\'ve known them for life.  They\'re the only people, besides my family, that I can really be me around.  No worries. Just fun.  They like me for who and what I am, and I feel the same way about them.  I want to go back to New York so bad.    I think my biggest fears about coming to college have to do with people.  I have always been a very shy person.  I\'m petrified to go anywhere or do anything by myself, because I\'m afraid to talk to other people.  I\'m also afraid that because I\'m alone, people are going to think, \"God, what a loser. She has no friends.\"  So, when the time came to leave for school, I didn\'t want to go.  I didn`t want to be on my own.  I had no friends that were coming so SMU.  I was completely and utterly alone. And that\'s how I felt.  I still do.  Sometimes.  I miss my family a lot, which seems kindof stupid to me sometimes, since I only live about 45 minutes away.  But I miss them like crazy.  We\'ve always been really close.  I\'ve come to depend on them to always be there, and now they can\'t be.  The first couple of weeks especially were terrible.  I cried every night.  No more Mom and Dad to be there all the time to make things right.  It\'s time to grow up.  I\'m not ready.  I guess I have lived a sheltered life.  They  always tried to keep me protected from things and people that would hurt me.  I never really realized how much until now.  There`s a lot of cruel people in the world, and I\'m just now learning how really cruel they are. People make fun of me.  Because I\'m shy.  Because of the way I dress.  The music I listen to, the friends I have.  I don\'t get angry though.  I just get hurt.  I always seem to have my feeling hurt for some reason.  Maybe I look for it.  Send out signals or something.  It hurts so much.  I just want people to like me.  I want to have friends and fit in.  My parents say I try too hard.  A girl on my old floor told my I don\'t try hard enough.  So who\'s right?  I hate my old roommate.  She made my first month miserable.  She turned almost everyone on the floor against me.  I don\'t know everything she said, but I know some.  She told them all I ever do is study.  She said I was boring.  She told them I was gay!  I was really hurt by that.  I mean, it\'s stupid and immature, and definitely not true, but what if someone believes it?  What if a rumor starts because of it?  My whole life here could be ruined!  I can\'t believe she did that.  I always pictured my roommate and I as being the best of friends.  Talk about disappointment!  She is such a bitch!  I`m glad I finally got to switch.  I\'m much happier.  I have a new roommate, room, floor, and friends.  To hell with the rest of them!  I miss my friends back home.  I miss the one\'s in New York, where I used to live even more.

There are plenty of other people in the same boat.  But it seems like everyone around me has handled the situation so much better than I have.  Everyone else seems so calm, cool, collected.  These girls are all so poised.  They know what to wear, where to go, what to say.  I feel so frumpy.  I don\'t think there is any way I can measure up to them.  I think the fact that I feel so uncomfortable is showing.  I think people can tell. But I don\'t know how to keep it hidden.  And I don\'t know how to overcome my feelings.  I never seem to feel good about myself.  And I keep telling myself that I should take the attitude that I\'m me, so who cares what everyone alse says.  If they like me for me, that\'s fine.  If not, who cares. But I can\'t.  I feel betrayed too.  I was so sure the guy I like liked me too.  We\'ve been friends for about a month now I really thought he liked me as more than just a friend though.  I like him as more.  But I didn\'t want to wreck our friendship by telling him.  But then I told him.  He just wants to be friends.  It hurts.  I know that\'s just the way it goes, and at least we\'re still friends.  But it hurts because he\'s my friend and he let me down.  But it\'s my fault for trying to make something more of the friendship.  I don\'t want things to change between us, but I think they already have.  And I think he likes someone else.  If they get together, it\'s going to really be hard to be around them.  Maybe in time it\'ll be easier. But it hurts so much right now.  The worst part is that he\'s been the closest friend I\'ve had since coming here.  I talk to him about everything.  And now I don\'t know where to turn.  I feel like I really need to talk to someone.  I\'m just that way.  I need to talk about things that are bothering me. There isn\'t anyone here for me to do that with now.  Why did I mess things up?  I don\'t know what to write about.  I don\'t know what I feel about coming to college anymore. I just wish that I wasn\'t here. I mean, there are some fun times, but there have been some pretty bad times, too.  More bad than good, it seems.  I didn\'t want to go to college.  But my parents kept saying, \"What are you going to do for the rest of your life without a college degree?\"  Everyone expected me to come to college.  So here I am.  But why?  I don\'t want to go home, either, because I might miss out on something here.  I\'m so torn.  Why can\'t this be easier?  Why can\'t I make good grades, get enough sleep, make lots of friends, and be happy?  I just want to be happy.  I was so happy this summer. What happened to me?  This is so scary.  I\'m just numb all over now. I don\'t really feel anything but bad.  I feel all the bad emotions, depression, hurt, anger, sadness.  But the good ones just don\'t seem to come. At least not in large enough quantities.  I want to be happy.  Really happy.  I want to feel good about myself again.  But I just don\'t know how anymore. I just don\'t know.  I\'m always tired.  Always have a headache.  Always bored.  Nothing\'s interesting anymore.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.29,0,3.23,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.53,0,0,1.29,5.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.23,0,0,1.94,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0.97,0,0,1.29,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,9.06,Female20b
'    One of the hardest reasons for coming to SMU was the distance it is from my home, Macon, Ga. I have a boyfriend in Macon who I have been dating for two years and ten months. Even though we have dated for so long, my senior year I dated another guy for six months. However, right before I left to come to school my boyfriend and I got real close again. My first two weeks at SMU were terrible. I didn\'t want to meet anyone, I just wanted to be with my boyfriend. Now I have adjusted to being away from him. When I went home last weekend, I did not even care about seeing him. I didn\'t even want him near me. It was as though my feelings really had changed. I would not let him see that I felt different, because I\'m too scared about losing him.  Now I have met a guy at SMU that I like a lot. He is probably one reason why my feelings towards my boyfriend have changed. However, I just do not trust him. I don\'t want to ruin things with my boyfriend, because of a guy I do not trust. This guy gets mad about my boyfriend and says that I can\'t have the best of both worlds. My boyfriend gets mad whenever he thinks I\'m having a good time out here. I can\'t sort out my feelings. I don\'t know whether my feelings for my boyfriend are gone or just on the back burner. I can\'t decide if I really like this new guy or if it is just infatuation.  I start getting terrible headaches when I think about it. I worry that this new guy is going to make a fool out of me. I have never let anyone do that. I have always come out on top, but I don\'t know if I can keep doing that at college. I have never really let anybody hurt me. I guess since my parents have tried to protect myself. I\'m scared that someone is finally going to get through to me, and I don\'t want to feel the pain.    One of the reasons that made it hard to leave home is having to leave my father. My parents have been divorced since I was three years old. I don\'t remember them ever being together like parents. When I was five my dad remarried, but he was not going to have any more children. However my stepmother tricked my dad and got pregnant. I\'m glad that I have a brother now, but my stepmother resents me very much. This is why I have grown to dislike her. One time this man was telling me how much my dad and stepmother were worried about me on my senior cruise. My stepmother bluntly said in front of people that \"she wasn\'t worried because I\'m not her child.\" Another time she almost wouldn\'t let me talk to my dad when I called from school, because she said I had already talked to him once that week. My brother spent a month in the mental hospital when he was nine for depression. I think it was because she wouldn\'t let him grow up. Now that I\'ve left I\'m scared she is going to try to squeeze me out of my dad\'s life. My brother told me that she was going to change the will if my dad leaves me a lot. She really makes me mad. I just don\'t want my dad all on her side because I have always been a daddy\'s girl and I like it that way. I also feel sorry for my dad. Everyone demands so much of him. He is paying for me to go to SMU because he knew it would make me happy. But now he has to listen to my stepmother bitch about me going to such an expensive school. I love SMU so I want to stay here. However, if I don\'t get financial aid, I\'m worried my stepmother will talk my dad out of paying the full price. I want to tell off my stepmother sometimes, but I just don\'t have the nerve. I hate the way she bosses my dad around. I wish my dad had never married her.    For the past two nights I have been writing about my problems with coming to school. I feel that in the future there are going to be some definite changes in my life. I think that I am no longer going to have a boyfriend back home. I think soon I am going to be able to totally let him go. However, I feel that sometime after we get out of college we may get back together. I think that my stepmother may keep on becoming more and more of a problem. I hope that with me being away so much that maybe she will back off and not resent me as much.  The only problem I have with this experiment is that I do not think that I have expressed my feelings very clearly. I guess at this point I am very confused about the feelings that I have. I have always kept my feelings bottled up inside.  The main reason I don\'t want to give up my boyfriend is because then I won\'t have anybody. I\'m afraid not to have anybody at all. I am also afraid that if I don\'t hang on to him that I will never have anyone again who loves me as much as he does. What also gives me a bad feeling is that I never really lived with my dad. I feel like I missed out on what would have been a great relationship. I think we have a good relationship now, but I think it could have been better. I  always wanted to live with my dad for a while, but whenever I was over there my stepmother was such a smart ass that I never could have lived with them. She always tried to say little things to upset me    One of the hardest reasons for coming to SMU was the distance it is from my home, Macon, Ga.

'    Education is very important to me. My family has all gone to college. I want to be successful in life and I view education as a way of learning and developing strengths and weaknesses. I have no real idea what I want to major in. My family doesn\'t pressure me, but they pressure me with grades. They expect certain things from me. I usually live up to them. Their pressure is not too great. They respect me and I respect them. They are very important to me and I love to please them. I have no hard feelings toward them. I love my family very much and we are really close to each other. I came to college to learn, to grow, to find myself, and see how I can stand on my own. I enjoyed it. It\'s satisfying, thrilling, but hard at times. I want to broaden my views on life, people. I like taking classes that interest me, that give me a broader view, some culture. I really like learning. It\'s exciting. I know that if I had not wanted to go to college my parents would have said that\'s ok, but college will help me in the future, besides being knowledgeable about different things. Having conversations with different people you won\'t feel stupid, you would be able to answer in an educated manner. There are many different things to learn and learn from. It is interesting, hard, fun. Many times I feel confused. Not about why I\'m here. I never doubt that I\'m here to grow and become a well-rounded, educated person. My sway of moods confuses me. Those come more from the social side than school. I enjoy school, Learning, studing. I feel better capable of dealing with life\'s little problems. If I can conquer a class, tests I feel better about myself. The big picture, I always wanted to come to college. I don\'t think I want to be a professional. I didn\'t come to college specifically for a law degree. I came to learn about different, random subjects, get different views on things, not be so sheltered as everyone says I am, to learn about the world, people. I am not just here like others say \"to get married\"! No way! That makes me so angry when people say that to me. It makes me feel like they think I can\'t be independent, or successful. That I just came here to find a smart, rich husband! No way! I came here to enhance my mind, self. I can be successful in whatever I put my mind to in whatever field I want.

Some days everything is great. I feel skinny, healthy, pretty, nice, I have a great feeling about everything the world, school, boyfriend, parents, friends, I\'m so excited about being in college, at a new place, I get really into all my classes, I feel energetic. Many sophs this year have told me they felt this way last year and to wait, 2nd semester is better! Well ok, so I wait. So many days I\'m down on myself, totally obsessed with my weight, feel ugly inside and out. I feel mad, confused, sad, depressed. I get in fights or arguments with my boyfriend which is so unusual because we rarely fight. I feel insecure and he doesn\'t know what to do because he\'s so far away so I get mad. Totally stupid. Then I get mad at myself. I sit there and think how stupid that all is! I think that\'s so abnormal. I talk to my roommate about this because she feels this way often too, but I really never tell parents. My mom would just get upset and when she gets upset she gets sick. So I cry and am moody all the time to my boyfriend. He\'s my best friend ever! I know things will get better, but what also lowers all my self confidence is when the guys my roommate and I think are cute always call her and ask her out! She feels bad because I\'m not going out and I feel inferior and ugly and the depression and tears set in again. I don\'t really tell her that I\'m upset that she\'s going out because that would only make her feel bad. I guess I may be a little jealous, but I don\'t ever say anything or take it out on her. I shouldn\'t feel this way I have many things people would kill to have, a boyfriend that I love so much, and a stable family and home.  I\'m really grateful and fortunate. I\'m the person I am and I must be patient. Patience, I keep telling myself. Be patient! God says to be patient. He will give you what you need! I know this hard time in my life will only make me a stronger person. I\'m not dangerously depressed or anything. It\'s just a change. I have my head on straight and I don\'t compromise my morals. If people don\'t like the way I am, tough! It just takes a while to find those close, wonderful friends that I left in high school! I miss them. Many of them have the same feelings I do. Well I\'m not really scared or afraid of anything. I just want this part to end. I want to be happy and secure where I am. Not that I\'m unhappy all the time, but I\'m just self conscious, and that\'s stupid. But I guess it\'s just a part of me! I need to work on being thankful for what I have.

I never argued or even thought that I may not want to go. It\'s just something that one does after high school! I was really excited about going to SMU. I applied early decision and got in. My parents and aunts, uncles, grandparents have all attended SMU and I grew up with a love for the school. I kept thinking of how great it would be to get away from home, be on your own, no curfew. I would day dream all the time about my room and going to school. It was really exciting. The feeling of walking to classes and the excitement and security of new people and new friends. I love all my high school friends, but in many ways it was just time to get out. Friends were starting to get into little fights and it was time for everyone to split up and do their own thing! I came to SMU and was so excited, but one thing people when I was in high school kept telling me how great college was and how much fun I would have. They told me I would have many dates. I day dreamed about going out with these gorgeous guys and being good buddies with many of them. Everyone said school would be hard, but that it was so much fun! I thought about it all the time. When I got here I thought (expected) my whole life to change. I expected too much really. I expected to be asked out all the time and be good friends with all the guys. I expected to go to many parties. In high school I had many guy friends. I\'m kind of shy and have high morals and guys would always tease me about my morals, but they developed a respect for me! many of my closest friends are guys. Well, I expected that to happen here! I guess too soon.  Anyway I got here and I loved it! We fixed up the room. I love my roommate. She went to high school with me and we are a lot alike. Everything was great, but then everyone started going out with all these guys all the time. Parties and everything, but not me. It is really hard. I feel really insecure and down on myself. I have gone out with older guys all my life and here it really seems like guys don\'t even look or say \"Hi\"! All the guys look at are these gorgeous girls with great figures. I\'m not one of the incredibly sexy people. Cute, nice, friendly, but not sexy. Well anyway, I believe that when I lose weight I feel better about myself. Well, one thing I forgot to mention is this guy, my boyfriend. He is a Jr at UT and we are so in love. That also made school hard, but we have a different relationship. He wants me to date and go out with other guys, and I want him to date also. We both know that we just can\'t sit around, but we know God will be with us and we think He wants us together. Well my boyfriend really helps me. He encourages and never says not to do something even when he thinks I\'m wrong, but even though I feel insecure here and unhappy with myself I keep telling myself it will get better and I know it will.

'    Tonight I feel like a fat pig again. I started my diet today, but it\'s so hard to stick with. Are people not going to like me because I\'m not real skinny? That could really suck if they didn\'t. I\'m going to a sorority open house tonight. I hope they like me. I feel so insecure sometimes at college. At home, in high school, I wasn\'t even real insecure. I had lots of friends and I was well liked, I think. I felt really comfortable around all those people, and I could really be myself, but here at college, I\'m not real secure. I sometimes don\'t feel like I can really be myself. It seems like I always have to try to please someone else, instead of myself. I\'m so worried all the time about what people think about me. I feel so self-conscious about my looks. Why wasn\'t I just born skinny? One fucking month ago, September 1, I was skinny and now look at me. I\'m a total pig. Sometimes I wish I were dead, other times I just wish I were back in high school, but all the time, I wish I were skinny again. Back in high school, everything was so easy. Then, it didn\'t seem easy at all, but now, looking back, it was easy compared to now. I didn\'t have to worry about making new friends, impressing people, or acting a certain way. I could just be myself and everyone liked me for who I was. I feel like such a damn failure sometimes. I know I shouldn\'t, I\'ve got so much going for me, but I still do. It\'s just such a big change to go from being #1 in my class academically, popular, and well liked by everyone to being totally unsure about my grades, not real popular, and not knowing very many people. I feel so unstable and insecure. I know my insecurity is part of the reason I feel so homesick for home. I want to talk to my boyfriend all of the time. He makes me feel loved and happy and secure. I feel like I don\'t have to worry about anything when I\'m with him. He is so great. I miss him so much. Why isn\'t he here? I need someone to make me feel secure again like I did in high school. I had it all in high school, now that\'s all gone. Not all of it, but I feel like a lot of it is. I know all of these writings make it sound like I hate college and that I\'m a totally unhappy, miserable girl, but that\'s wrong. I really love SMU and college life. Although I am insecure, I have met a lot of neat people and have made a lot of good friends. I hope that someday I will became as good of friends with some of these girls as my friends back home. God, I miss my best friend so much. I even miss my parents and brother so much. I never thought I\'d miss my brother very much, but I do. Although all of these things I\'ve written about sound terrible, I am having a good time and I know things will get better, I\'ll lose this weight again and feel better about myself which will make me feel more secure and self-confident. Also, I\'ll meet new people and make more friends, hopefully guys included. I try to keep a positive attitude, but sometimes it\'s real hard. I think I need to ask God to help me. He has always been a big part of my life.    When I first decided to come to SMU, I was real excited, but also a little bit scared. I was worried that I hadn\'t made the right decision. All of my friends and my serious boyfriend were going to OU. All through high school (until my senior year) I thought I\'d go to OU, also. My best friend, Angela, and I had planned to room together. My boyfriend, Lex, and I had both planned to go to OU and continue to date. Then, everything changed. I decided to come to SMU and leave everyone behind. It was exciting in a way, but also very scary. My boyfriend was so upset with me. It seemed like everytime we would talk, I would end up crying because he made me feel so bad for \"deserting him.\" I really began to wonder why I had decided to come to SMU. I remember all of my friends and boyfriend left for college almost 2 weeks before I did. I was so lonely for those 2 weeks. I missed everyone so much. I cried every night thinking \"Why in the hell am I going to SMU?\" My parents couldn\'t stand to be around me anymore because I was so gloomy and grouchy all of the time. I always took my sadness and anger out on my family. I know that was not fair and I feel awful about that now. But, thank God, I\'m lucky enough to have understanding parents who understoodwhat I was going through. They tried their best to make me feel better, but I was still miserable. I missed everyone so much. My best friend would call me every night and tell me what was going on with her sorority rush at OU. Everyone was getting what they wanted in rush. She sounded so happy on the phone. It made me real jealous and even a little hostile toward her. I would have given anything to have been there at OU with all my friends going through rush. I also talked to my boyfriend every night. It was so hard knowing that we were going to be at 2 different colleges and dating other people. (That\'s what we had decided to do.) I would always have to be fake and act so damn friendly when I talked to Angela, but deep inside i felt miserable. I felt so sorry for myself all the time. Finally, the day came for me to go college. I was actually excited. I couldn\'t wait to get away from Duncan (my hometown) and stop being lonely. i was really nervous about my roommmate. I thought for sure I\'d get someone who had totally different beliefs and tastes as me. I just knew we would get along awfully. But, I was wrong. When I finally got here to SMU and met my roommate, Shannon, everything was better. I started thinking that maybe everything would be ok after all. I started thinking that maybe I had made the right decision. That first week I was so busy that I really didn\'t have much time to think about all my friends at OU that much. Of course I still missed them a lot, but I wasn\'t always feeling lonely and depressed because they weren\'t there. I wasn\'t feeling sorry for myself like I had been before. I still talked to Lex every night on the phone and I still missed him a lot, but things were beginning to look better. He seemed happy, which made me jealous, but I was also happy for him. It\'s hard to explain, I wanted the best for him, but it hurt to know that he was having fun without me.     Tonight I feel like a fat pig again.

I went from 150 to 120. I felt so much better about myself. I had a lot more self-confidence and I was a lot happier. I was so excited to come to college because I was finally skinny. Weight has always been a problem with me. I think about it constantly. I think I\'m really obsessed with food, dieting, and weight. What\'s wrong with me? I was so happy with myself when i got to college. Although other things were depressing me like being away from all my friends and my boyfriend, I still had my new skinny figure to be excited about. It made me anxious to meet new people and make new friends, boys included. I had confidence about myself when I met new people, and I know it showed. People can always tell when you\'re self-confident or when you have no self-confidence at all. I know everyone could tell I was happy and that was good. I enjoyed going out with friends and meeting group a lot more than when I weighed 150. I finally felt confident about just going up to a guy and talking to him. I wasn\'t always thinking, \"Oh my God, I can\'t talk to him, he\'ll think I\'m fat and ugly.\"  I\'m not saying that all of my happiness was to the fact that I had lost 30 pounds, but it did have something to do with it. Well, after orientation, I don\'t know what happened. Everything has been shot to hell. I\'ve been eating like a fucking hog. I hate myself. I am totally out of control. i have gained 25 pounds in the last month. Is that sickening, or what? I can\'t believe I\'ve let this happen to me. I hate myself so much. I\'m not even happy anymore. I am a fat, ugly, slob again and I can\'t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I\'m so embarassed. I feel like people hold it against me because I\'m not skinny. I hate that. Why couldn\'t I just keep all that weight off. I am such a fucking pig. I\'m always depressed. I can\'t go into that damn cafeteria without eating a bunch. I\'m always craving sweets, cookies, cake, pie, anything. What is wrong with me? I can\'t believe that college has done this to me. Before I came here, I felt like I was in total control, but now I feel like I have no control. Everyone will die when they see me next week-end. I\'m so embarrassed and ashamed. I\'m so furious with myself. My parents and brother and friends will just die. I can\'t believe I\'ve done this to myself. What a total BITCH I am.

'    One of the hardest adjustments for me in coming to college has been learning to trust people. It\'s so hard to get to know a person here. Everyone has been thrown together and we\'re all in the same place. Scared.I have a difficult time trusting people because I\'ve been hurt before. The people I have met so far have fallen into 2 categories: those I\'d like to get to know better, and those who I know I can never trust. I feel that if I can\'t trust someone, we can\'t be friends because all friendships are based on trust. Respect is also important. There is a girl in my dorm who\'s been with 4 guys (not just dated) since we\'ve been here. I have a hard time looking her in the face. I don\'t respect her and we obviously don\'t believe in the same things. All of the people seem to take sex so lightly which really makes no sense to me. I guess I just feel that it is something to be shared between 2 people who love each other. Nowadays it\'s part of casual dating. I have managed to avoid these problems. I have a boyfriend at Texas A & M. The separation has really done us good. Sure, I miss him, but I study, am developing new friendships, and have time to be an individual instead of 1/2 a couple. We\'re supposed to date other people, but so far neither of us have. I know I won\'t because it\'s important to me to be with just one person. I\'m sure in time he\'ll date other girls. We have agreed to be honest with each other about it, though. I want to find out from him, not from someone else. My parents really like him. That means a lot to me. I really love my parents and their opinions are very important to me. I always want to make them proud of me. A lot of the things I do for me are for them, to. Studying, getting good grades, and just trying to be a good daughter. We have a very close family. It\'s just the 3 of us. Sometimes I love it, other times not. There is so much pressure on me to be successful. I have to excel at everything. One day I even want to take over their business. They`d like to keep it in the family. Family is very important to me. I\'d like to have a family of my own in six or seven years. 2 or 3 kids. Not just 1. I\'d hate to have an only child. Sometimes it\'s great. Other times it\'s the pits. I want to get married soon after college. I could see myself married to my boyfriend. He\'d make a great husband. I also still really care about my ex-boyfriend. he was my first \"true love\". That was 2 1/2 years ago. I still care about him and always will. It\'s just that he can manipulate me so well. He always gets what he wants and I\'d do anything for him. He knows that and it has become a problem from time to time.     For me, college has really been an eye-opener. I do love it, though. I love the freedom and being in charge of my own life. Initially college was something I did for my parents, but in the end it had to be what I wanted. In some ways, college allows you to get closer to people because you live with them 24 hrs a day. You also get to see their bad sides, though. People say that you make your life long friends in college, but I think that mine will be the friends I had in high school. The friends that I grew up with are the ones who truly know me. A lot of the friendships which I\'ve seen formed in high school are real. These seem so fake and superficial. Maybe with time they will seem more real. Who knows? I\'m really glad that I came to SMU. It has been easy for me to adjust here, or easier than I thought. I\'m glad I didn\'t end up going to A & M or UT. They are too big. I like the smaller school. It promotes a closer feeling among the students so you\'re not just a number. I think that people should go to school for themselves, to better themselves. One shouldn\'t make the mistake of going to college for someone else, or to make someone else happy. You must make yourself happy first. I think that the world would be a lot better off if people took care of themselves first. We have ourselves to take care of and worry about. Everyone likes to please others, though. Sometimes this happens even at the cost of your happiness. I\'m supposed to be tying things together, but when I start writing I end up getting on to different topics. this writing has been good for me. It brought my feelings for a person to a point where I now understand them and can deal with them. By carefully thinking through a situation, one can come to make decisions on their own instead of letting someone else do it for you. This has been one of the few times when I\'ve sat down and really put what\'s going on in my head down on paper. It\'s important to know what you are thinking and to be able to act accordingly. Take time to come in touch with your feelings.     Probably the hardest part about coming to college for me has been leaving the people I love. My parents, friends, and boyfriend. It\'s seemed like I\'m just a visitor when I\'ve gone home. That\'s because I miss out on so much of the day to day happenings. My parents really miss me. They\'ve commented on how quiet the house is and how the phone never rings. I really haven\'t gotten homesick. Since I only live 20 to 40 minutes away. I can go home as often as I like. It\'s nice being so close to home. i thought that it would be like I never left, but it\'s not.  I really miss my friends a lot. They are all spread out all over Texas. My best friend from 2nd grade goes here, and that makes going here, so much better. We\'ve never been inseparable. Sometimes, even though we\'re only a building away, we won\'t see each other for 2 or 3 days. It\'s important that we have our own lives.I know that she\'ll always be there when I need her. One of my closest friends is still back in my home town. I can pick up the phone anytime I need him and he\'s there for me. I miss seeing him all the time, though. Another friend of mine is at A & M. He\'s a sophomore. Last year he was my \"rock\" who pulled me through even the smallest \"crisis\". he was always there. This year, I\'ve decided that I need to stay in control of my phone bill and he\'s the worst pen pal. Needless to say we\'ve drifted apart. I really miss the closeness we used to share. He\'s so busy and so far away that he really hasn\'t been there when I\'ve needed him. He\'s really let me down a lot. He doesn\'t understand how much his friendship means to me. I don\'t think he ever will, until it\'s too late. hopefully, he\'ll realize before then.  I miss my boyfriend. I haven\'t spent hours or days pining over him, but I do miss spending time with him. This separation has served to make the time we do get to spend together better. We don\'t fight or argue, but I know that neither of us is perfect. He\'s great for me. He pushes me to do and be the best I can for me. Not for anyone else. Above all, he\'s always conscious of my feelings and tries to avoid hurting me if at all possible. Someday I\'d like to marry him and have a family. I don\'t see this happening for 5-6 years, though. A girl in my dorm is already engaged. It seems that she\'s wasting the best years of her life. they`ve only dated a year. She\'s 18 and they\'ve set the date. What happens when they get out in the real world and have to support themselves? Will she still love him then?    For me, college has really been an eye-opener. I do love it, though. I love the freedom and being in charge of my own life. Initially college was something I did for my parents, but in the end it had to be what I wanted.

He pushes me to do and be the best I can for me. Not for anyone else. Above all, he\'s always conscious of my feelings and tries to avoid hurting me if at all possible. Someday I\'d like to marry him and have a family. I don\'t see this happening for 5-6 years, though. A girl in my dorm is already engaged. It seems that she\'s wasting the best years of her life. they`ve only dated a year. She\'s 18 and they\'ve set the date. What happens when they get out in the real world and have to support themselves? Will she still love him then?',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.87,0,0,8.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.47,Female20b
'    I really thought a lot about my friends yesterday after this experiment. I guess I miss them, I\'m used to seeing them everyday. I was going to write them all last night, but when I got to my room I just did homework instead. I keep buying things to write to my friends, but I never write. Which leads me to one of my concerns, money. I am really concerned with the amount of money I have spent for college stuff. I don\'t have a job so the money I have has to last me all year. Independence is really a lot of trouble it seems. It\'s nice and everything, growing up and making decisions, but I\'m worried about making the wrong decisions. I feel that I am pretty steadfast in my morals, so I don\'t think that I would ever not stand up for what I believe, but i have given a lot of thought to the way I act around different people. I have made friends here and I\'m comfortable with them, but there are some people who seem to get all the attention and sometimes it seems I want to get to be friends with them instead of a face they see a lot. I don\'t want to compromise who I am though, just to be friends with certain people. A lot of the time I get along better with guys than girls, because I really don\'t care about \"feminine\" stuff. I don\'t like to get dressed up or wear lots of make-up, but I still want to fit in. I guess I\'m pretty doubtful about myself sometimes. I get along good with guys and goof around and stuff, but i don\'t want to be too \"show-offish\" or anything. I guess I want everybody to like me at the same time, but if that means compromising who I am then I don\'t want that. But that\'s really hard, just trying to be yourself and if people don\'t like it, then tough. I\'ve thought about that a lot lately. Change is hard for me. I don\'t want to change, but you can\'t expect not to being so far away from the things that made you who you were before. Now I have a fresh start, nobody here knows me, and I can make a name for myself for who I am, not for who my father was. He is a minister by the way, and I\'m proud of him. I just got a lot of flack from people being a \"preacher\'s kid.\" Now nobody knows me and I can be whomever I please. I just hope it doesn\'t go to my head and I start acting like someone I\'m not. This might not be a big deal to some people, but it is to me.  I got a letter from my sister today. I really miss her. I want to write her, but I don\'t know if I will. I feel so indifferent towards friends and family. i call my family every night, but I feel like I don\'t want to every night, but that I owe it to them to call. They miss me and stuff, but I just don\'t like calling all the time. I really love my family. I never wanted to \"get away\" like some of my friends. It just has always taken a lot for me to be the one to call people. I just don\'t like to be the initiator. I don\'t know why. I guess it\'s not as fun. i might start calling them less after I get the phone bill, the money problem again. it seems to go so quickly, it really bothers me. I have never been one just to spend money, but there are so many expenses right now, I just hate it! And I\'m always sore from carrying my backpack around. I\'ll probably get sick from all of my complaining and worrying. My psychology teacher told me that through tests, college students showed they were    My future at SMU. tricky question since I am still trying to figure out my present state at SMU. I\'m trying to deal with my classes. I still don\'t quite feel I\'ve gotten into the seeing of things yet since it is still the first week of school. I go through all of the motions, going to class, getting my homework done either on time or ahead of schedule, but I still feel like there should be more than just school, but I haven\'t found it yet. I\'ll keep looking, though. In high school there was more than school, going out on weekends, even on week days, goofing off and watching TV, but what is there to do in a 10 x 15 cubicle called a dorm each evening. I have no car, nor have I gotten offers from anyone with a car. I\'m still waiting for something to make me feel like there\'s more than just class. I\'m not talking about religion either, because I\'m pretty steadfast in my faith. I\'m simply talking about life outside the dorm room. I want to get involved in activities, but things haven\'t begun to get rolling yet, so all I can do is sit and wait, which is quite boring. If you would have asked me later I might be so busy that I couldn\'t have even spared this 20 minutes, but not so now.  I got a letter from my sister yesterday, so I wrote her last night and told her all of the stuff that\'s been going on. It kindof made me miss not having her barge into my room and talking to me. I miss seeing all of my other friends, but not like I\'m gonna break down if I don\'t see them, though. I still haven\'t heard from my \"boyfriend,\" though, and I keep wondering (a lot) what he\'s going to say, how things are going for him, what\'s been happening. I\'ll just wait on that, too.  My anthropology class has a \"people-watching\" experiment, which I love to do. I like to be detached and watch how people interact around me. Sound depressing, but not really. When I am in a group, I really like to be in it, not really the boss, but I like everyone to know I am there. Probably my own insecurities of \"will everybody like me.\" I don\'t care too much if people like me or not, that might be harder to say if I knew that everyone didn\'t like me. Still, I like to know if people like me, whether I care or not. I\'ll try to fit in, and if I don\'t, then I just don\'t. My problem comes in knowing when to stop trying.    My future at SMU. tricky question since I am still trying to figure out my present state at SMU. I\'m trying to deal with my classes.

Before leaving for college I found myself trying to put all of my relationships (family, friends, boyfriend) into perspective. I really thought a lot about how my relationship would be with my boyfriend after I left, and after he left because he moved to another state (because of his father\'s job) one day before I left for college. With my friends I didn\'t worry so much because I knew we would keep in touch. As the time came closer to leaving I began to get more casual about the whole thing. I realized my boyfriend and I would stay in touch as friends, although that\'s not what I really want, but what I knew would happen anyway, and I know that is probably the best. We got along great as friends and I feel that we always will. It was hard to tell him good-bye though. But I didn\'t cry, not once through the whole college transition. I always cry, in movies, after reading sad books, on the last day of high school each year. I really am very emotional. I haven\'t cried one bit at the reality of my being alone at college, away from friends and family. I still don\'t know why because I always cry. I guess I\'m feeling a little detached. I ended all my friendship relationships with, \"See ya later\" or, \"Talk to you later\", just like I\'d see them the next day at school or something. I\'ve only written two letters since I\'ve been here, which surprises me. I have thought of each of my friends at one time or another since I\'ve been at college, especially when I see someone or something that reminds me of them. I\'m never sad, though, I usually laugh as I remember the funny things that have happened with my friends. Maybe it will be a delayed reaction with me or maybe it\'s that I am comfortable enough with the relationship between me and my friends that my separation from them doesn\'t bother me. If I had to choose today, I\'d say that I am just comfortable with my relationships and know that they haven\'t really fallen off the face of the earth. Everyone is just a phone call away. I haven\'t really faced the possibility that my old friends could be replaced (or at least have to share the attention) by new friends. It was real hard for my parents to leave me. Even my dad cried. I never cried, but thinking just now about my dad crying is making me cry. I talk to them on the phone a lot, and they are only 3 hours away so I\'ll see them often. I know I haven\'t lost them or that I\'ll never see them again, but just knowing that things will never be the same again is kindof scary. I\'ll probably never live in my house again, which is a weird thought. Things will happen in my home town without me, which kind of makes me mad. I hate not knowing what is going on. I called my sister today (she\'s 15, and we have never been apart) and asked her about her 1st day at school. She kept me up to date, but it was weird not being there with her or not driving her to school. We went to different high schools so she doesn\'t miss seeing me around there. I still miss just goofing off with her. I guess really I haven\'t quite come to terms with what the future holds, but so far I\'m not too terribly homesick.

'    Since I have come to college, I have felt much more confident of myself. In highschool, at times I would be hesitant to enter a classroom late. Now however, I don\'t think twice about entering tardy. As soon as I stepped on this campus in July for AAARO, I knew I was going to like it here. I had not been on campus for no more than 15 minutes and I had college guys saying hello to me, nudging their friends when I would walk by, and staring at me. Never in highschool had I received so much attention. (Maybe it was because I attended the same private school for 14 years and I knew everyone!) In August, when freshmen had to be here, nothing changed. One day while we were at a seminar or something (it was manditory) a slide show was presented. I wasn\'t really paying attention until several of the guys in the audience began to clap and whistle. I looked up at the high screen in McFarlin auditorium only to see myself. It seemed like my picture remained up there for all to see forever. Later that afternoon, I had about 15 guys (good-looking too) come up and ignite a conversation with me (in which they so cleverly asked me out)! One of them, we\'ll call him Mr C, especially caught my interest. He was different than most guys. He seemed very sincere and he was the only one that didn\'t ask me out. Finally one night during orientation we were both in the same group of people going to a party. Well to make a long story short, we hit it off really well and later on decided to go outside. He seemed so different. Well we come back to school and let me just say he could make an octopus look bad (HANDS). I put a stop to it. He said he respected my decision and walked me to my dorm.     Being accepted by everyone is one of the most important feelings to me upon coming to college. I\'m extremely happy here because I feel I have been accepted. From the first day on this campus I was accepted. There are several people, a lot more than several people, who have not been accepted. I sincerely feel that in order for a girl to be accepted at SMU she must be beautiful, skinny, have a great personality, and must like to party. I feel like I maintain all these qualities, but at times some of them fade. When I came to college, I weighed 123 lbs (I\'m 5\'9\"). I never dieted or anything while I lived at home. Within the 1st 3 weeks of school I had lost so much weight I was down to 111 lbs. I didn\'t diet, I wasn\'t upset or depressed, I just had so much to do that I would forget to eat. I didn\'t mind though because I was skinny. I soon put myself in a bikini and headed for the pool to catch some rays. As soon as it got too cold to lie out, I noticed that I began to gain the weight back (against my wishes). Pretty soon there after, I had gained back all the weight plus 8 lbs more, putting me at 131, the most I\'ve ever weighed in my entire life. I was so upset that I went on a diet for 3 days. I was supposed to lose up to 10 lbs. I only lost 4 lbs. I was so upset. I knew that on this diet, losing only 4 lbs was good because that was all I needed to lose (according to the heart surgeons that invented this diet). I was so upset I starved myself the next day. then the next day I only ate dinner. However, after eating dinner I felt so guilty, I went into the bathroom to make myself throw-up. While unsuccessfully gaging myself, I knew what I was doing was horribly wrong. It was like I had lost total control for about 3 min. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I kept on trying. I finally gained control and left the bathroom and went into my room. Since then I have never tried that again, but I look in the mirror and weigh my    Since I have come to college, I have felt much more confident of myself.

I guess to try and sum everything up in a mere 20 minutes is quite impossible. I still am very happy. I no longer even think of trying to make myself throw-up. I get along fine with Mr H (or whatever I referred to him as). We\'re not the best of friends, but we say \"Hi\" and briefly chat with one another when we cross paths. I\'m very relaxed (to a point). Actually I guess I am very much on edge because of finals coming shortly, rush rapidly approaching, and the guy I\'ve had an interest in asked me to a formal on Friday night. My mom is coming in town, and I have so much to do. My attentions seem to be divided in all different areas and ways. I\'m very tired right now and this writing doesn\'t help much. Although I\'m very stressed. I try not to show it. I\'m usually never like this. I am a very easy going, relaxed person. I think I may need to examine my life and set some new and improved priorities. I think writing about this has helped. I had a lot bottled up inside me that I needed to release. This was the perfect way to do it (I think). I still feel happy and relaxed and extremely tired (both physically and mentally). I really don\'t know what else to write about. I hope that I have been somewhat helpful in your experiment. I do at times feel awkward telling a virtually complete stranger all of this because I just don\'t do things like this, but it makes me feel better and it is hopefully helping you in your experiment. I really am having a very hard time this time writing for the complete 20 minutes. It\'s just that I have a lot to complete and do in a very short ',4,-4,1,1,1,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.39,Female20b
'    I think the most emotional thing that has happened to me during this time was leaving my best friend. We have been friends since I moved to Gillette four years ago and I\'ve never been closer to anyone else. She has also never let me down as a friend as this has happened with people other than her. I liked being able to trust her without questioning it at all. I don\'tthink I have even missed being around any of my other friends, my parents or even my home town. I was only in town for two weeks before coming to SMU for those days we spent almost all the time together. We partied, worked out, ate, shopped and we were almost never apart. She left for college one day before I did and that was the worst day of my life. I felt really insecure without her even though I had a lot of other friends around me. I think the reason me and my boyfriend broke up was because I needed to spend more time with her before I left. Besides my parents, Kim is the only strong tie I have with Gillette. I didn\'t even care to see my mom before I left although I felt really bad about that. When we drove by the town where Kim went to school I honestly started to cry and I didn\'t want my mom and stepdad to know. I didn\'t even cry when they dropped me off in Dallas and I didn\'t miss my real father and stepmother. I spent a good part of the summer with them in Akron. My stepmom and I got along great. Better than we ever had. They were so much more understanding about college than my mom and Bob and they still are to this day especially concerning finances. This is one thing I don\'t like about college is not being financially independent. I worked a little during my Senior year. Enough to pay for car insurance and spending money so I didn\'t even worry about mom getting annoyed at giving me money. I didn\'t really realize that Kim and I were so close. We\'d been best friends for 4 years, but I didn\'t ever think I\'d miss her badly. I always considered myself so independent and not relying on someone else. I haven`t ever really had a serious relationship with a boyfriend and I think it\'s because I don\'t want to have to depend on anyone. I have seen a lot of guys and some have been lasting (3-5 months) the longest was 11 months so thats really not very long, but I never was sad to break up with any of them I just got sick of them. Kim told me she went through a really tough time when I left this summer and now that I feel this way I feel terrible.    When I came here to SMU I found it really easy to meet people and to get to know them. I can see that it is really easy to fall into a click here. I mean I really want to rush a sorority but there is so much pressure. I am fully intent on rushing in the spring but I\'m also very worried, The competition will be really hard. I don\'t care which one I get into as long as I like the girls. It will be a great way to get involved and to meet other people. As I see it now there are so many great people here who I feel so comfortable with. I think I fit in great here, and even more so than back home. Some people I\'ve met are already my good friends and I feel like I\'ve known them all along. The only thing I am worried about here is keeping my major. I am in Biomedical Engineering and I\'m afraid it\'s going to get so difficult that I won\'t be able to handle it with the social life I have. That is one of the goals I am working on is to go engineering without studying constantly. What a joke. I do know that if it gets to hard I\'m going to easily change majors because I don\'t have my heart set on anything really.  Sometimes I am afraid that all of the people here are extremely fake or stuck up. Like I have this phobia that one day I\'ll wake up and everyone will hate me. Deep down I already know that will never happen, but it frightens me sometimes. The first few days after my parents left and before classes began I felt really weird. Like I had nowhere to go, and I felt kind of disassociated. I had friends, it wasn\'t a lonely feeling, just a weird unattatched feeling. I know it was due to such a great change in lifestyle You know, no parents to rag at me or wanting to know when I get home at all. I hadn\'t really ever checked in with them on what I was doing, but here I never even had to see them and no one really cared where I was, when I got in, or who I was with. That\'s a very strange thing. I\'ve gotten home at 5:30 one night and I still had to get up the next morning and I\'m the only one who suffered. It makes one realize how parents really do just worry, They really don\'t care where you go, just that you get home safe. I don\'t miss my parents yet except that I got into a fight with mom a couple of days ago and I still haven\'t resolved it. I did, however, write her a letter but that\'s just not the same. I have to wait so long to hear what she says and how she reacts to my letter. The fight was about money and I hate to worry abut finances. (I\'m sure I could never be an accountant or anything like that). The fight was actually pretty dumb, but my mother never was very organized and it really bothers me. That\'s part of the problem.    My mom and I had always been really close until my senior year, then I was really busy and more or less living without her comments or according to her guidelines. She never knew if I would be home or not, and I really didn\'t care if she knew. She still wanted to know what time I got home on Friday and Saturday nights, but that was it. When I left her to come here I didn\'t even feel close to her. I was so used to making my own decisions that I didn\'t even know how to ask for her advise. This summer when the details of finances and technically getting to college or getting through all of the minor troubles came around she expected me to figure out everything and I wasn\'t able to deal with that. I really needed someone else to figure out everything and I just wanted to be in college as fast as possible with everything all smoothed nicely over for me. Mom and I got into numerous arguements over this ordeal. This was really difficult because I lived 1000 miles away from her this summer. We ended up having quite a telephone bill. She kept getting mad at me for not telling her how much things would cost when I had given her the information to read long before that. I was so aggravated at her! She acted like she wasn\'t going to lift a finger to figure these things out and I should have made all of these huge decisions myself. When I would suggest things to her she wouldn\'t even attempt to do anything and I\'d have to remind her again! I know she cared about me getting here but I didn\'t even want to get close to her before I came. She just really seemed like a stranger and it seems to me like it is because of me stepdad. My stepmom cares so much about me and my stepdad is proud of me but he has too many other things to worry about. He has Pretzled my mom`s brain so she doesn\'t even think clearly or at least like she used to. She\'s becoming more and more old-fashioned. She\'s interested in shit like wildlife and wide open fields instead of exclusive stores and metropolitan like she was. Oh well enough crap. I can\'t stand my stepdad anyway, he\'s a dork and I\'m glad to be away from him. He was never mean to me, he never even had any control over the house. Lately he\'s tried to take over a little of the control but he\'s too much of a wimp. He just bugs me. What a lame duck.  I didn\'t really ever feel detached except from my best friend.    I think the most emotional thing that has happened to me during this time was leaving my best friend. We have been friends since I moved to Gillette four years ago and I\'ve never been closer to anyone else. She has also never let me down as a friend as this has happened with people other than her. I liked being able to trust her without questioning it at all. I don\'tthink I have even missed being around any of my other friends, my parents or even my home town. I was only in town for two weeks before coming to SMU for those days we spent almost all the time together. We partied, worked out, ate, shopped and we were almost never apart. She left for college one day before I did and that was the worst day of my life. I felt really insecure without her even though I had a lot of other friends around me. I think the reason me and my boyfriend broke up was because I needed to spend more time with her before I left. Besides my parents, Kim is the only strong tie I have with Gillette. I didn\'t even care to see my mom before I left although I felt really bad about that. When we drove by the town where Kim went to school I honestly started to cry and I didn\'t want my mom and stepdad to know. I didn\'t even cry when they dropped me off in Dallas and I didn\'t miss my real father and stepmother. I spent a good part of the summer with them in Akron. My stepmom and I got along great. Better than we ever had. They were so much more understanding about college than my mom and Bob and they still are to this day especially concerning finances. This is one thing I don\'t like about college is not being financially independent. I worked a little during my Senior year. Enough to pay for car insurance and spending money so I didn\'t even worry about mom getting annoyed at giving me money. I didn\'t really realize that Kim and I were so close. We\'d been best friends for 4 years, but I didn\'t ever think I\'d miss her badly. I always considered myself so independent and not relying on someone else. I haven`t ever really had a serious relationship with a boyfriend and I think it\'s because I don\'t want to have to depend on anyone. I have seen a lot of guys and some have been lasting (3-5 months) the longest was 11 months so thats really not very long, but I never was sad to break up with any of them I just got sick of them. Kim told me she went through a really tough time when I left this summer and now that I feel this way I feel terrible.    When I came here to SMU I found it really easy to meet people and to get to know them. I can see that it is really easy to fall into a click here. I mean I really want to rush a sorority but there is so much pressure. I am fully intent on rushing in the spring but I\'m also very worried, The competition will be really hard. I don\'t care which one I get into as long as I like the girls. It will be a great way to get involved and to meet other people. As I see it now there are so many great people here who I feel so comfortable with. I think I fit in great here, and even more so than back home. Some people I\'ve met are already my good friends and I feel like I\'ve known them all along. The only thing I am worried about here is keeping my major. I am in Biomedical Engineering and I\'m afraid it\'s going to get so difficult that I won\'t be able to handle it with the social life I have. That is one of the goals I am working on is to go engineering without studying constantly. What a joke. I do know that if it gets to hard I\'m going to easily change majors because I don\'t have my heart set on anything really.  Sometimes I am afraid that all of the people here are extremely fake or stuck up. Like I have this phobia that one day I\'ll wake up and everyone will hate me. Deep down I already know that will never happen, but it frightens me sometimes. The first few days after my parents left and before classes began I felt really weird. Like I had nowhere to go, and I felt kind of disassociated. I had friends, it wasn\'t a lonely feeling, just a weird unattatched feeling. I know it was due to such a great change in lifestyle You know, no parents to rag at me or wanting to know when I get home at all. I hadn\'t really ever checked in with them on what I was doing, but here I never even had to see them and no one really cared where I was, when I got in, or who I was with. That\'s a very strange thing. I\'ve gotten home at 5:30 one night and I still had to get up the next morning and I\'m the only one who suffered. It makes one realize how parents really do just worry, They really don\'t care where you go, just that you get home safe. I don\'t miss my parents yet except that I got into a fight with mom a couple of days ago and I still haven\'t resolved it. I did, however, write her a letter but that\'s just not the same. I have to wait so long to hear what she says and how she reacts to my letter. The fight was about money and I hate to worry abut finances. (I\'m sure I could never be an accountant or anything like that). The fight was actually pretty dumb, but my mother never was very organized and it really bothers me. That\'s part of the problem.    My mom and I had always been really close until my senior year, then I was really busy and more or less living without her comments or according to her guidelines. She never knew if I would be home or not, and I really didn\'t care if she knew. She still wanted to know what time I got home on Friday and Saturday nights, but that was it. When I left her to come here I didn\'t even feel close to her. I was so used to making my own decisions that I didn\'t even know how to ask for her advise. This summer when the details of finances and technically getting to college or getting through all of the minor troubles came around she expected me to figure out everything and I wasn\'t able to deal with that. I really needed someone else to figure out everything and I just wanted to be in college as fast as possible with everything all smoothed nicely over for me. Mom and I got into numerous arguements over this ordeal. This was really difficult because I lived 1000 miles away from her this summer. We ended up having quite a telephone bill. She kept getting mad at me for not telling her how much things would cost when I had given her the information to read long before that. I was so aggravated at her! She acted like she wasn\'t going to lift a finger to figure these things out and I should have made all of these huge decisions myself. When I would suggest things to her she wouldn\'t even attempt to do anything and I\'d have to remind her again! I know she cared about me getting here but I didn\'t even want to get close to her before I came. She just really seemed like a stranger and it seems to me like it is because of me stepdad. My stepmom cares so much about me and my stepdad is proud of me but he has too many other things to worry about. He has Pretzled my mom`s brain so she doesn\'t even think clearly or at least like she used to. She\'s becoming more and more old-fashioned.

'    Being at college for me wasn\'t as difficult as it was for most people. I had lived away from home during the summer. I really miss the atmosphere of home. I feel I don\'t have that supportive hand of my mother. She has supported me throughout my dancing career. She has always been there with me after dance class when I\'m crying and upset because I felt like I couldn\'t go anymore. Now I\'m all alone. I feel really lonely, like all the people I have met have been putting on an act and they are not being sincere and I wouldn\'t become good friends with them. I don\'t miss too many of my friends at home. I just get so lonely sometimes.  When I was at home I was pretty independent, so being here didn\'t hurt me in that way.  Sometimes I feel like this isn\'t the right place for me to be. So many people gave me different advice. People have told me to go to NY and study, stay in Florida and study, go to Atlanta and study. Sometimes I just wish I could end it all (but I never would).

Right now I\'m just taking it one day at a time and I\'m keeping an open mind about things. I don\'t know if I\'ll come back next year. Being a dancer is really difficult. I don\'t know where to go to get what I need to make it in this field so I am very confused about being here. I like it so far, but I know the real world of dance isn\'t as easy and pleasant as it is here. It`s hard because one minute you can have a job and one minute you don`t. It is hard for me to leave my dance school that I\'ve studied extensively at for 5 years. It is scary being here and not knowing a soul, but then I like it because I have a fresh new start at things. I really hate how people segregate here. They will pick their friends on how they look or dress or act. I wish everyone can be friendly and open to everyone. I don\'t know if my future will hold here. Right now I just want to learn everything I can from these teachers and then I\'ll move on and study somewhere else or get a job or something. I just want to be happy. One day I would love to teach children, but right now I love to dance and that\'s what I want to do and I am determined to be the best that I can be. I will make it someday dancing. I think SMU will give me a lot of what I need to reach this goal, I think.     Being at college for me wasn\'t as difficult as it was for most people.

Ever since I got to college I was doing ok and I wasn\'t really homesick, it just hit me all of a sudden. I feel really scared and alone. I feel so small and unimportant here. At home and at dance class I was most of the time the center of attention. People and friends looked up to me and wanted to be like me and dance like me, but now I\'m just kindof there. I\'m really worried and nervous. Ever since I got here I haven\'t been able to sleep at night. I dread going to bed at night. I just lay awake every night until around 3:00am worrying about the next day. My mind is just going and going. I feel like no one cares about me. I really wish I was at home in that loving atmosphere. I feel I don\'t know where I\'m going. No one has called or written me from dancing. I\'m not sure if college is the right thing for me. There is so much I want to do. I want to be on Broadway. I feel like I\'m not getting anywhere, like I\'m at a stand-still, and I\'m not going any farther. I feel like I can\'t do anything.

'    To put the whole thing in perspective. I guess it is like my mom told me it would be. You have to grow away from your high school friends and branch out so you can grow up. I guess it just took me a few semesters of college to realize it. At first I really resented her for even thinking that I would ever be apart from them. We seemed to be inseperable, but the more I think about it I realize that everyone feels that way about their high school chums. I kindof feel sad looking back and thinking what good times I had with all my friends and how close we were, but I guess things have to change. That is a depressing thought that things will always change. It makes me afraid to trust people or to get too attached because I know it will happen again. I will get to be really close with my friends and then will graduate. It makes me glad that I have changed from high school, but I like to think or daydream about everyone. I guess I\'ve learned to be more accepting at SMU. People here are just different than they were at home. There is so much money at SMU, but I guess you just have to go with the flow. It sure is easy to get jealous here. I know I\'ve probably been jealous of one thing or another for the whole semester. It doesn\'t do any good to be jealous, however. If you want something you have to go out and get it and don\'t let anyone stop you. The first semester has been a pretty fun one, just different, but if I put it into perspective it\'s just one small part of my life just like high school. I dislike most of the English teachers here. Or one in particular. I get so angry at my teacher because I feel like she is trying to get us to flunk. I could kick her sometimes. I know this isn\'t really in any one focus, but it is too confusing to figure out all of my feelings and then just write them down because I have mixed feelings. In a way I am so happy here, but in a way I miss home, but it\'s impossible to go back. That\'s the most heart breaking part of all. I realize I\'m not going to end up marrying the guy I dated through high school. He\'s changed and so have I as I said before. I really did love him, but things just don\'t stay the same. That\'s why I\'m kindof sad, but glad and excited at the same time because I have a whole new world to look at.    Well, the last time I wrote I wrote about how angry my friends from home made me. This time I\'m going to talk about my friends here. First of all, my roommate. My roommate is one of those kind of people who is really easy to get along with, but she has this attitude about herself that I find with a lot of SMU students that she is wonderful. She can be really intimidating at times. She isn\'t blonde like most people in Dallas, but just the way she moves her head and the way she walks shows that she thinks pretty highly of herself. For a few weeks she made me really depressed because I don\'t have that great of an opinion of myself and she would use this tone of voice with me like I was basically a fool. So then I just basically avoided her. That\'s when I got really depressed. I wanted to be as cute as she was or as cute as she thought she was. That\'s why one day I decided to look at things in a different way. I tried to not look down on myself as much and just accept her for what she is. I still feel a bit inferior when I\'m around her just because she tends to draw a lot of attention to herself. I guess it is true that whatever you think about yourself is what everyone else will think about you. I\'ve learned that it is important to have confidence and I\'ve been a lot happier. I still feel very insecure around people at SMU. Partly because of the Greek system. There is so much pressure to be like everyone else it is really frustrating. I\'ve heard a lot about SMU students and maybe that\'s the problem. I came with a negative attitude, but I\'m realizing that everybody here puts on their pants or their sorority sweats the same way I so. I think there is too much pressure to be like everyone else. I\'m learning that I myself don\'t want to be like everyone here. Why should I be a little barbie doll like half the other people. So I think I\'ve become more independent. Either that or just resentful. But I don\'t really resent that I\'m not like everyone else because I don\'t enjoy going to Greek parties and being a little sister and getting so drunk that I have no idea what I\'m doing. Maybe I\'ve matured. I know I\'ve matured past my high school friends. Even though they make me angry I\'m glad I\'m not around them because going out and getting drunk all the time gets old. So I guess I\'m learning not to make decisions based on what everyone else thinks. Otherwise I would just be lost in the crowd. I\'m learning not to let my roommate get me down and it\'s working. I just have to act like I\'m as good as she is or poke fun at her to keep her in place. That has relieved a lot of pressure off me. Now if I could just really believe that I am as good as she is. She was anorexic, so natually she has a great figure so I feel jealous, but I don\'t want to get my body screwed up by doing that. She still keeps very close watch on what she eats. I wish I had as much willpower as she does. I guess I\'m just jealous.    The most important things that have affected me in college are relationships with different people. My family, my friends from home, and my new friends. My friends from home have been the worst part of being here. I transfered once and then I went back home and then I transfered here because my parents refused to let me stay. That is the most frustating thing I have ever been through because I didn\'t want to leave. I loved my friends and my boyfriend, but since I came here I\'m beginning to wonder why. I had the best friend I have ever had come to visit me and I\'ve never been so hurt as when she left here. This is someone who knows everything about me and she made me so angry. I hate her. Since she left she\'s only called to ask for her tennis shoes back. That is the worst feeling to think that you could care for someone so much and then they can just forget about you. It makes you feel lost, or it made me feel lost. She did a lot of changing and so did I. She is a freshman and she just went wild being away. She didn\'t even say thank you and I paid for her ticket up here. What a bitch. the rest of my friends from home really make me depressed, too. If I wouldn\'t have called them they probably wouldn\'t call me. The only people I have stayed really close to that aren\'t here are my friends from Mt Holyoke. I\'m glad I have some friends that aren\'t here to count on. They make me feel good about myself. I have gotten a lot closer to my parents. They moved here 2 years before I came. I\'m really happy to finally be friends with my mother. It\'s a relief to finally be able to get along with my mom and dad. It\'s just scary to think how easily some people can just forget about you. I want to cry about it, but I am too pissed off to waste my breath. I have never had a girl friend who didn\'t seem to walk all over me. That is really frustrating. I\'m really glad I came here though because I feel like I\'ve made some close friends. I just thank God that the beginning of the semester is over. I hate feeling so anxious about what is going to happen, but now I feel more secure because I have my own group of friends. This school makes me very nervous, though. I guess I\'m paranoid about people looking at me. A lot of people here have snobbish attitudes about themselves. I guess the only way to deal is to try and feel the same way about yourself as everyone does. Sometimes I think people here are funny. A few of them live in some kind of bubble. They act like they\'re the center of their wonderful little universe. Amazing how much self-confidence can affect you. I have met a lot of people that I really do love, but I\'m afraid to get too close. Who knows what will ha    To put the whole thing in perspective. I guess it is like my mom told me it would be. You have to grow away from your high school friends and branch out so you can grow up. I guess it just took me a few semesters of college to realize it.

'    Tonight, I suppose I\'ll analyze myself, the big picture. I really do think that the reason why I am so offended by the SMU stereotypical population would be because I\'m insecure. I can\'t stand people that put on airs about themselves and try to look like everyone else. That bothers me immensely. I think that the responsibilities of college has weakened my strength. It could be some of the new people we met. Probably not, but my roommate, who I love to death is a dependent person totally. She has a boyfriend that she totally worships. I mean to an incredibly annoying amount, and my boyfriend and my relationship has never been like that, but now more than ever am I dependent on him. Things can not change like that. We love each other an incredible amount, but when I hear how my roommate talks to her boyfriend on the phone and some of the incredibly mushy letters they write each other, as much as I hate how obnoxious that is, I\'m sad because we (me and mine) have never been that gross and lovey-dovey, couplish. We don\'t like it. It bothers me when others do it, but for some reason I\'m kindof jealous because I think that their relationship is stronger, but that isn\'t so. Have I become a wimpy dependent baby? I don\'t fit in at SMU. Actually, I do, it\'s because I like to be different, voice my own opinions. I don\'t like sorority girls and I\'m not rich. I have too high of expectations for my life. I can\'t try to be someone I don\'t want to be, or even can be. I just want to be as happy and normal all the time. I hate bitchy people and weasely people. I need to find a place for myself instead of floating as I have been. In high school I was on dance team for a year and a half, but when I realized that those girls were not really my friends and I didn\'t like the organization, I got heavily involved in drama, and was happy from then on. I have to figure out what I want first, before I can get it. I guess that\'s why I\'ve been unhappy lately, I want something, but I don\'t know what. I suppose my first step is to figure that out, then I can go about getting it. Then, I\'ll be happy. I never realized until just this second what my problem was, but I\'m sure that history repeats itself, because it has so many times. In the meantime, I need to get back to normal, meet some more people in order to help me figure out what I\'m looking to do, and take classes, learn as much as possible. I think I\'ve written that sentence in an essay before, and it might have even been the one i sent to SMU to get me in, and it did. All this I have written in the past few days has helped me realize what\'s been going on with me. Even though it\'s all been obvious, I suppose it does help to write. I will become myself again, quit worrying about stupid things like the boyfriend situation because that`s how we\'ve always been and always probably will be. I know in my heart how much we love each other, even if he is the laziest person I know. I just need to start accepting things that can not change. If we have been working so well together with only one mishap in almost two years, we have a good thing going. I\'m learning to grow up. I\'ve had lots of responsibilities lately and quite a few coming up in the next few weeks, such as huge bills, debts, finals, homework tomorrow, classes, work, etc. But I suppose that all I really need to do is always have faith in myself and not expect anything to be done for me. That\'s my biggest responsibility, but I\'ll become strong again, if I do everything I can for myself. But I\'ll always need my friends and family. I have to quit mooching off my parents so much and work as hard as I can.     Coming to college has been a great change for me. Besides just leaving home and my friends and family, SMU has been probably weirder than I expected. I have been having many troubles with myself in trying to stay at this school. My biggest problem is the attitudes here. I know it is a highly commended school and has high job placement in the future, but I hate the attitudes. This school is very close minded, upper middle class, white, money. I hate those things. It was incredible to me how important the greek system is. Since I\'m here on mostly financial aid my parents want me to stick it out here and can\'t see my point. I\'m getting a wonderful education for the price of a state university. They feel it\'s crazy for me to want to transfer. I\'ve never been a sorority girl type and probably never will. Besides all the bitchiness and artificialness of most of the cloned sorority girls, I can\'t afford it at all. I have too many other things I need to pay for. I am the second oldest of the kids and I have to do well in college. My older sister tried to go to college at home, but dropped out and will probably never go back. My other four sisters are identical quadruplets and I would love to be rich and successful in a few years to help pay for their college, but I honestly do not like school here. When I went home for Thanksgiving last weekend I must have cried 4 hours. It\'s very upsetting to realize that I have to grow up and nothing will be the same. I was very depressed because it seemed like to me that all of my old friends from home that I was so looking forward to seeing all have someone better to see or be with. I felt very stupid for being upset, but I did. After I called 6 or 7 friends Saturday morning and they were too tired to go out or had to spend time with their parents or people that they don\'t see too often, I just broke down. I cried for an hour and my mother was trying to talk to me, but after I told her what was wrong, she repeated what I had said to everyone in the house for the next 6 hours. I felt that I was having a worse time at home than school, and if I\'m unhappy here, then I\'m having big problem and I am. Plus, my boyfriend left on Friday to go to El Paso to see some friend of his in a debutante ball, and they go to school together at UT. I do see him quite a bit, but not really enough and he wasn\'t even there when I needed him the most. I really think there is something wrong with me. I don\'t think it\'s physical, but I don\'t know. I was talking to my boyfriend Sunday Night when I got back and I was so upset on the phone. It was like he made it w    Last night after I finished writing I felt a bit of a release. I have talked to some people about my problems, but not all to everyone. I think now that I\'ve come to college I am more insecure than I ever have been and I feel really stupid about that. I\'ve always been a very outgoing, extroverted, even sometimes boisterous person, but I\'ve calmed down a lot. Actually it has been the past 6 months or so. Maybe I\'m growing up, but I really don\'t want to. I need to be a lot more responsible and as I notice that some of my new friends here aren\'t, I lack it (responsibility) sometimes as well, although I do think that I\'m accepting more and more. I don\'t know why, but I feel like I\'m above a lot of people that go to this school. This has to do with all the Greeks again. When I was little, wearing buttons of clubs (I was in with little animals and cartoons) was really \"cool\", but come on, 20 years old? There\'s a sorority girl that I work with that does nothing but draw her soroity letters and kites and small cats\' faces all day. When I look at people like that I look down on them and am much more impressed with myself. For the first time in a long time. I feel very impressed and shocked, but scared, but happy. It was definitely a turning point in my life. I am now in debt. I\'ve never owed any real amounts of money, but today as I was sitting in the Financial aid offfice and the advisor said, now you really have to pay attention to this, you owe this money, that was defiitely something that hit me hard. It\'s a little one thousand dollars, but that\'s real responsibility. To me anyway. Many things have added to my life as I have come to college, although for some reason I feel like I don\'t really fit it. I don\'t know as many people as I ordinarily do and I feel very unsatisfied. I used to, I would go up to people I wanted to get to know and introduce myself and start talking to them, but here at SMU it seems like so many of these people think they already have enough friends and acquaintances. This causes a big void for me and adds to this incredibly silly insecurity I have attained. If    Tonight, I suppose I\'ll analyze myself, the big picture. I really do think that the reason why I am so offended by the SMU stereotypical population would be because I\'m insecure. I can\'t stand people that put on airs about themselves and try to look like everyone else. That bothers me immensely. I think that the responsibilities of college has weakened my strength. It could be some of the new people we met. Probably not, but my roommate, who I love to death is a dependent person totally. She has a boyfriend that she totally worships. I mean to an incredibly annoying amount, and my boyfriend and my relationship has never been like that, but now more than ever am I dependent on him. Things can not change like that. We love each other an incredible amount, but when I hear how my roommate talks to her boyfriend on the phone and some of the incredibly mushy letters they write each other, as much as I hate how obnoxious that is, I\'m sad because we (me and mine) have never been that gross and lovey-dovey, couplish. We don\'t like it. It bothers me when others do it, but for some reason I\'m kindof jealous because I think that their relationship is stronger, but that isn\'t so. Have I become a wimpy dependent baby? I don\'t fit in at SMU. Actually, I do, it\'s because I like to be different, voice my own opinions. I don\'t like sorority girls and I\'m not rich. I have too high of expectations for my life. I can\'t try to be someone I don\'t want to be, or even can be. I just want to be as happy and normal all the time.

'    I have always been able to communicate with others more easily verbally. Not on paper. I discuss my problems and other people\'s problems all the time in \"talks\", so I do not know how well I will be able to express myself and my feelings on paper.  College is seeming to be a good experience for me, but one of the main things that is affecting me is my loss of security. At home, my parents are separated so I learned to find security in other forms. (Not that I didn\'t feel secure at one or the other parent). My friends meant and still mean the world to me. If it wasn\'t for their support and advice during my parents separation, I would probably be crazy, but then again everyone is in one sense or another. Right?  Yet, at SMU my friends are not here. I am making lots of new friends, who happen to be very nice, but it will take time for them to replace the role of my other friends. (I don\'t know if that came out right.)   Also, I miss the security of my boyfriend. When I got sick here the other day, there was no one around to ask me if I needed anything or if I was ok. Some of the guys here are pretty ignorant. They seem to me more like high school freshman instead of college freshmen. I\'m pretty critical of guys, but when the majority of a group acts the same way I feel it is accurate to classify them.  I thought I had pressures at home, but you\'re 1st year of college has to be the most stressful time of your life. I want to go to medical school, and I know it is going to take a lot of hard work and hard studying. I have always thought I could do it. It is so frustrating though, to study for hours at a time, when you have 50 other things on your mind. Like, how cold your dorm room is at night, how you want your boyfriend with you, how you wish you could be out with your friends, how you\'re going to pay for your long distance phone bill, how you feel everyone in a certain class knows what the teacher is talking about except you. Those feelings aren\'t always there, but they do occur.  This may sound weird to stick in, but everytime I write something I feel like it didn\'t come out right. Maybe because it\'s on paper. I feel I can express my feelings better verbally so sometimes I think anything I write sounds stupid.       I feel better today than I did yesterday. I got some sleep so I\'m going to have a happier tone on paper here.  I am supposed to look at the \"whole picture\" and tell my feelings. I guess under all the stress and depression I am scared. Not scared in the sense of being shot or raped or something, but scared in the sense of if I can make it. With \"make it\" I mean be successful socially, academically, and personally (at ease). I know or I feel that I can do anything I put my mind to if I really try and really dedicate myself, but with so many obstacles in the way, ie stress, lack of sleep, it sometimes seems so unreachable. I want probably what everyone else in the world wants. I want a good career (physician), to be financially independent (I learned early that 1 out of 2 marriages do not work), friends and eventually a happy, healthy family. I have to admit I\'m scared to get married though. I mean I love boyfriends, I\'ve had a boyfriend boyfriends since the 7th grade, and I enjoy the attention, companionship, love, but marriage is an abstraction to me in a way. It is such an enormous thought to actually give a part of yourself wholly, all the time, to another. That didn\'t come out right. I really can\'t explain it on paper. I think I am also completely off the topic.  I better go back to my true, underlying feelings of fear. I have my father, mother, friends, and boyfriend all telling me \"You can do it, you\'re very smart. You can do anything you want to\", but sometimes I feel I\'m not that smart. Actually, I do feel smart, in the sense that I can logically figure things out easily, and my eyes and ears are open to everytihing. I\'m very aware! I just feel sometimes that I want to know (I\'m very curious and interested in anything new I don\'t know about), but that I\'m not going to be able to learn it because I\'m too tired or just \"stressed out\". Maybe those are excuses, but that\'s how I feel. I wish I could be in a controlled environment sometimes, if that is healthy, probably not, but to have no obstacles in the way.     I have had a really long and bad day so my emotions will probably be quite pessimistic. I\'m glad I\'m getting to write my feelings down right now because maybe it will relieve some of the tension I\'m feeling.  I have had a very hard time managing my time at school. I go about 20 hours a day, been getting approximately 4 hours of sleep a night. I have a job, then of course school, and homework (lots), and a lot of little things one has to do every day. I have been going non-stop all day since 6am and I\'m very stressed. There should be 48 hours in a day. The sun should rise in the morning and set 2 days later. (At least while I\'m in college). The world doesn\'t revolve around me though, and I know that. One good thing is that I am going home to visit this weekend. I don\'t know if that\'s really going to be good or bad for me, but I felt I needed to go. I\'m going to see my mother, friends, cats, and boyfriend. Of course, I will probably come back Sunday night and be a total depression case. You have to take chances sometimes. don\'t know why I\'m so stressed, but it\'s getting on my nerves. Is that redundant? My father called me to tell me he\'s very lonely because my mother is not with him. I\'m their mediator. I totally hate it, but I feel it is sortof my responsibility to give him advice and comfort. Responsibility may not be the right word for it though. I hope I don\'t turn out like they did. I don\'t think I\'m anything like them, but who knows? they are really messed up.  To change the subject, last night I had 50 thousand things on my mind, so many that I couldn\'t even focus on one. It was strange. I couldn\'t sleep so I got up, turned on the light, and smoked a cigarette thinking it would relax me so I could sleep although I know nicotine is a stimulant. I was so mad that I couldn\'t sleep because I knew I was only going to get 4 hours of sleep. I ended up getting 3. My major is pre-med and I spent 4 hours today looking through a microscope at a cell of the intestine. Usually I\'m really interested in this type of thing, but today I was so frustrated I couldn\'t think straight. I think sleep would do wonders. I probably sound stressed too. I\'ve been very pessimistic lately, and I\'m usually a very optimistic person. I didn\'t use to get very depressed. I came to SMU with a very optimistic outlook on school, but i don\'t know about that now. I need to study harder, but with my job I don\'t have much time, except late at night. Late at night I don\'t know if the material is really soaking in. I hope so. I feel very tired right now, I hope you can read my writing. Psychology is really interesting, maybe I should become a psychiatrist. That might be kindof depressing though, listening to other people\'s problems, fears, and anxieties all day. Or, on the other hand, it might be refreshing to know others have a lot of problems also and that you\'re not the only one in this world with bricks on your shoulders. I hope tomorrow is better because today was one of the worst since I\'ve been here.     I feel better today than I did yesterday. I got some sleep so I\'m going to have a happier tone on paper here.
