5 Recruiting Tricks of the Trade
 
Amidst wide-spread cuts to company budgets, headcount and resources, recruiters nowadays are pressed to take on more and more with less and less. Current market conditions have created new challenges for recruiters across all industries. Recruiting strategies and sources that may have proven effective in prior years are now antiquated and less productive. The need to be cost-efficient without cutting corners and sacrificing quality of hires is a skill recruiters across the spectrum are having to master. 
 
For most of 2009, I spent more time assessing and re-assessing the effectiveness of our overall recruiting strategy at Esurance, while ensuring that not a penny over what’s necessary is spent. I’m sure this hits home for many of you who either lead talent acquisition teams or play a vital part in identifying talent for your organizations. During the course of these re-assessments, I came up with the following creative ways to do more with less.  
 
Staff Re-alignment & Re-evaluation of Best Practices
 
The past year provided numerous challenges as Esurance tightened its belt and worked to optimize efficiency across all departments. With some relatively simple maneuvering and fluid communication with our business leaders, we moved from a regional recruiting model to a business specialization model. The team’s workload was stretched, and we were able to support a larger, broader customer base. A re-alignment and streamlining of tasks immediately followed and each recruiter now provides their internal client groups with end-to-end (full life cycle) recruiting support. This has led to faster cycle times or an average time to fill of 23 days for Esurance as a whole. 
 
Job Boards
 
Undoubtedly, this is the most cost-consuming part of my budget. While the overall effectiveness of job boards in general is questionable in the age of social networking and talent communities, it still remains a key part of our recruitment strategy. But what do you do when you need to fill a specific or technically niche position(s) due to unanticipated turnover and have little to no more money to spend? This is where “out of the box” thinking is crucial.  
 
Explore options with your Account Manager to see if unused job postings can be exchanged for other services– such as name-generation lists, source and screen, inmail or targeted email campaigns– which enable you to reach applicants with the specific experience you’re looking for without having to dig deep in your pocket.
