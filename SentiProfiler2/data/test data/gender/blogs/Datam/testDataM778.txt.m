I've spent the last few days sick, ugh. Hoping today is better. I think I'll read comics for a bit and then tackle work. More sketches to accompany a short story I wrote. An amazing band covering an amazing song originally done by New Order. Theodor Kittelsen is an artist, like John Bauer that deserves wider recognition in the English speaking world. Kittleson, also like Bauer, is primarily known as a "troll" artist as his best known work was illustrations for books on Norwegian folklore. Unlike Bauer, whose work is filled with unthreatening and friendly trolls Kittelsen monsters are darker, more mysterious and much more frightening. These works are amazing and haunting and have had a huge impact on me. A sketch I did of Atha. Not a lot to say this morning. We're feeding Henry and it's really windy and wet out. I'm off to play RPGs this afternoon. Plan to check out comic shop called The Hairy Tarantula. That's it. A pretty amazing sword &amp; sorcery romp. I can't believe I've never read it before. Moore's writing is quite good, not overwrought like some pulp stuff. The book also feels pretty fresh and original. Not a lot female characters in the sub-genre have been quite like this.I was disappointed she only wrote this handful of Jirel stories. Some sketches for an upcoming book cover I'm working on. The above picture I did to as a sample for a job. It was rejected by the author because he thought the coyote wasn't sly enough. This was one of Canada's most famous writers. Ouch! I got over it. I don't really like his books anyway. I got such great responses to my post on rejection a few days ago I thought I'd post some quotes from them here. Russel Dickerson said ".... there's no one on Earth harder on my work than I am. The actual rejections I've received haven't said anything worse than I've already thought." Glendon Mellow "... send them more artwork. A change in editorial personnel or style, or even just the right art at the right time may see the relationship change for the positive. Rod McKie "Bide your time Eric, the best revenge is living well." Charlene "I don't think they mean 'you suck', which is probably where the sting comes from for most of us." Dave Howlett "Best you can do is believe in yourself and that what you are doing is both worthwhile and something that you would enjoy reading yourself. Certainly no editor should be able to discourage that, whatever their reasoning." Grimalkin Press "PROVE THEM WRONG." Madeline Carol Matz "rejection letters is like an actor not getting a callback for a part. " Viviane Schwartz "Ah, you can't please them all... If the illustrations they generally use look really different from yours than that's just what they're set on using. - It's really frustrating."
