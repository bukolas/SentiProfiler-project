…And as the rain fell brilliantly against my window on a Saturday afternoon I noticed a pattern within the glitter of the rain drops.  The pattern was of a face that I recognized as life and we stared at each other.  We wanted to see who would be the first to blink and neither of us wanted to be the first one to give in.  What I noticed in life’s eyes were my many sacrifices as I have had to hurdle the jump ropes of reality in order to live dreams without having to close my eyes.  And in this life, my life, I have suffered to be able to smile; I have cried to be able to enjoy my fate.  Acceptance is our greatest sacrifice I’ve come to learn because until we accept our challenges we aren’t able to come up with a game plan to reach our goals or to stimulate our own identity.
