i might be moving back to california, maybe in the spring. i don't know. one minute i'm awful excited, the next it almost brings me to tears. i just got started back in school, i have friends there.. i have the potential of having a life.
i just don't want to move again. but maybe it could be for the best.
i'm so unbearably lonely, all the time. i sit at my house waiting for him to decide i'm worth picking up for a moment or two. i hate leaving my house in fear that i'll miss my chance when he actually wants me.
every time i leave to go anywhere, with the exception of school, i get extremely panicked and anxious. i don't know what to do with myself.
i think it's pathetic, how i'm still the one cast aside. the one who's proved loyalty, honesty, devotion.. versus the one who used you 'just to see'. i know things are rough for you, i've been through it with you the whole time. but i can't handle this. i know you care, but i need it to be showed. i need to be taken care of sometimes.

she used you, used us.. the same way she does with everyone.. you won't ever see it, you won't ever realize. but it's the honest truth, everyones else knows.
i mean, who else can go in.. destroy the perfect relationship between two people in love. just as an experiment? to see if it would work?
then a month later, decide. 'oh.. well i didn't actually feel that way. i just wanted to see. i thought so, but i was wrong.'

i'm not even going to lie. it's awful what you and her have done to me. but being who i am, go figure i'd cast it aside. continue to be there for you BOTH. i'm so devoted, my life is spent doing what you want, or need. i take care of you constantly, and i don't even mind. i just wish you'd notice. i love you.

since i've met you, you've been the one thing that i completely put myself into. the one thing that i always think about, the one thing i always work to do for.
on my birthday at disneyland, i told everyone i felt sick with a migraine because you said you were upset, and everything with your dad that day. i didn't want to not be available for you.. i didn't want to not be able to be there for you. so i came home. on my birthday, just to be told that you were going to sleep.
i bought you that $100 stuffed kangaroo so it would be shipped to your house before i left, just so you wouldn't be as lonely at night without me around.
and every day.. i talk to you when you want to talk. i leave you alone when you don't. i'm at your disposal.
and then, i do what i can for her as well. i take care of her when she's drunk as all hell, i take care of her emotions. i'm nice to her. when she back stabs me. im still there
