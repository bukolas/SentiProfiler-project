Impurity is the only thing that is pure. The greater, richer and so called pure things are always vulnerable to impurity. But impurity in itself is the truest of the forms. Look at the world. The corrupt hearts are so strong. Least shaken and unchanged. So mighty powerful that the world used to be a better place once with only a handful of corrupt hearts. But those handful ones had the mighty power of impurity. They spread it like the plague. Look around you. What yo ve is the invincible disease. So much so that the God's heart is touched by it and its a never failing touch.
