I am a 34 yo husband, father, health care practitioner and traveler; though not always in that order. Born in FL, raised in NY, grew up in AK and now reside in WA with my wife of 10 yrs and 2 children. I have been working in Alaska in the same field for the past 11 yrs and I still love my job. I know I am very fortunate to go places, see things and meet people that many people will never get the chance to experience.We arrived to Adak Island on September 28 and I can literally count on one hand how many nice days we've had here.  Yesterday the most recent and even though it was cold, it provided a nice clear day to take some photos.  The first shot is 6 photos stitched together for a panoramic of the town of Adak.  The other 2 photos were taken after capturing a dozen or so still shots of the young eagle.  I stood and waited for about 20 minutes waiting for it to fly off so I could capture it in flight.  I almost missed too, but the wait was worth it.  Adrian and I have one more week here before we fly back home for Christmas with the rest of the family.  I hope to get one more nice day to get more photos of all there is to see here before we return in January when there's sure to be a lot more snow a lot less time.  We'll have less daylight and add to that A season for Cod fishery and Opilio crab.  It's bound to be a busy time at the clinic.  Hope you enjoy the following pics.
