Indiana is very much a player in the recruitment of Moses Abraham.

After meeting with IU coach Tom Crean in Washington D.C. Tuesday night, Abraham has agreed to visit the Indiana campus, possibly as early as Tuesday of next week.

Abraham, a 6-9, 237-pound center from Nigeria, has made official visits to Georgetown, Maryland and Tennessee. He had to cancel an earlier visit to IU because he had the flu. Over the weekend, he had narrowed his college choices down to Georgetown and Indiana and was expected to announce his decision Sunday.

That decision has been delayed pending a trip to Bloomington.

Abraham, who attends Progressive Christian Academy in Washington D.C., is a member of the 2010 recruiting class and could play as a freshman in the fall.
