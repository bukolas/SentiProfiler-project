My facebook has me remember how worthless the people were who I grew up with still are, except the very few, (two out of hundreds!!!), and myspace I have found handfuls of insightful, intelligent, talented, humorous, and invigorating people I thought I had lost, and others I probably would have never met on this planet. 
Due to this, I realize I could have done things differently, but that doesn't mean more worthwhile.  
And with the stimulation of new friends, I have something stirring in my soul that I haven't felt for way too long... confidence to achieve whatever the hell I want!  Just thinking about the possibilities possible, makes me feel like the old me that I admired. The old me that was about fun for everyone.  The old me that could find a use of the info I aquired that could benefit all.  The old me that felt good about myself.  Hell with a new me, I'll keep the old me.
