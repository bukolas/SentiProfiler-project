If Arsenal get Inter in the next round expect 180 minutes of squeaky bum time with little action. My flat mate (the united fan) reckons Arsenal'll get Bordeaux or CSKA Moscow. Obviously I won't complain if we do but one thing's for sure: If Chelsea got through tonight they'd definitely have gotten one of those 2 in the quarters so let's all be grateful for that and keep our fingers crossed for a United-Barca match up. If we can avoid them enroute we can make the final.

Since Bendtner's late winner on Saturday against Hull the stat men have said that Arsenal officially score the most late goals (after 75 mins) in the Premier League. I think any Arsenal fan would probably know that to be true too. I was stood watching the Hull game in the pub and my girlfriend came in after work with about 10 minutes to go and asked if I'd be grumpy if we drew. We both knew the real answer but I said I wouldn't be. I was surrounded by grumpy gooners. That was until Bendtner scored and the place went absolutely ballistic and it felt fantastic. Dan, my other flatmate (the one without a club), was watching with us and as I looked around for him I noticed, what at first glance, appeared to be scuffle. In actual fact Dan had been mobbed in his celebrations by two Arsenal fans in their fifties. It was such a relief and the grin on Dan's face as we left the pub was amazing. He said he was thinking about supporting Arsenal and I told him that if he wanted to he was more than welcome but that disappointment is as much a necessity of being a gooner as faith in Arsene Wenger is. In truth I was dead chuffed.
