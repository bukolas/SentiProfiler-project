Taking shelter from the rain we shook ourselves dry underneath a hut and puzzled about where all these people were. The tidy, simple huts on stilts looked empty apart from the orange clothes hanging outside some of them. Monks robes.
I know this will be hard to believe, but an overwhelming majority of the divorced parents I've worked with truly want what's best for the kids. Unfortunately, a lot of behavior suggests otherwise. But, let me remind you that divorce is packed with overwhelming emotion, high stress, and periods of utter chaos. And keep in mind that some people just do not get it when it comes to healthy interaction. Not only that, some people simply cannot control their anger. Combine that with little skill in the communication department and you have a good chance for conflict.
A formal legal separation is more permanent, more complicated, and more expensive. It's also much less common. It's nearly as expensive as a divorce - sometimes more so, because it's less common - so you may have to pay your lawyer to figure out how to do everything. And often people who get a formal legal separation wind up having to go through all the pain, time, and expense again later to get an actual divorce.
The 72 hours run out from when the bill is posted online. Now, as to what they'll be voting upon. As Kate points out TNR's Jon Cohn outlined three possibilities on Saturday. On Sunday, the White House declared its preference for options one or two when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declared on Fox News Sunday, “We'll have the votes when the House votes, I think within the next week. And I think whoever sits here this time next week, you all will be talking about health care reform not as a presidential proposal but as something that will soon be the law of the land.” In other words: they don't want to wait for the Senate to act – which would take another week minimum. They want President Obama to sign a bill into law before he leaves for Indonesia and Australia – this is, after all, why he postponed his trip. So this leaves us with options one and two. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is doing her best to save her members from one – a vote directly on the Senate bill – as she doesn't want to further burden them with all the Senate sweetheart deals that are going to be stripped out in reconciliation any way. Which leaves option No. 2, the most likely one House aides told me.
Still the captain smiled, but he wasn't blinking and his grin was fixed. I'm not sure who's teeth were worse, but this would be a battle between man and land. The waves were still pushing us Beachfront actionaround and rain was punching down from the sky

hey :) Cool questions, is this like a test? I would say guys probably did lose weight faster then women at a guess. This could either be because of some biological reason such as men having more muscle the women thus having higher metabolisms, or it could be due to the stereotypical ways in which we train differently. In general women shy away from doing weights because the don't want to look manly but lifting weights causes a much higher increase in resting metabolic rate then cardio does. So there's my ill informed answer lol hope it helps in some way :)
A few people have asked me if Our Cancer is just a new name for the blog, so I wanted to explain a bit more. Our Cancer is whole new thing that's a direct offshoot of the blog, which you can find at npr.org/ourcancer. On the blog, Leroy or Laurie would write something each day and publish it. Then the rest of you would then post a comment as a reply to whatever they wrote. It's a great way to collect responses from people, but doesn't make it possible for everyone to start their own conversation.
As the waves approached, the bow and all the passengers would lift into the air, smashing down the middle of the boat heavily into the next wave, right under dirty old fishing fleet my feet. I looked down each time to spot cracks or leaks, but by now so much water had blown in or had rained over the side, it was hard to spot the signs of a sinking ship. We cracked down onto the second wave with the bow facing down and so in the best position for a third wave to crash over and into the boat, soaking us all - first time journeymakers and the long-time resident hippies of the islands.
Look, we all pick up bad habits around our eating. We eat more than required, or we watch the TV while eating, we eat junk food, maybe we're just depressed and don't care and food is a source of comfort - whatever your situation is, I can tell you one thing: If there is anyone who can help you best, it's yourself! Try and use affirmations and visualisation to help you focus on the way you would like to see yourself ideally. Learn  about the Glycemic Index - you probably don't have a "sweet tooth" but are stuck in what's called the "insulin trap", which causes you to eat every so often and also is the main contributor to weight gain. Set up a good exercise routine - preferably with a buddy who can motivate you and hold you accountable, I use GR2 control meal replacement shake as it keeps me feeling full for long and provides a constant source of energy from morning till lunchtime.
Along with abuse, it is also important to recognise if your relationship is not only making you miserable, but is also robbing your self esteem. When you realize that the effects of your relationship are preventing you from enjoying life, it is time to step back and re-evaluate your relationship. Of course no relationship is perfect and you can expect to have good and bad times, but if things have become so negative that you no longer feel good about yourself, then the relationship is destructive and needs to end.
Yes. Men do typically lose weight faster and easier than women. This phenomenon is due to a man's on average higher metabolism. A man's higher metabolism comes from a typically higher muscle mass and muscle burns more calories. Also, men are typically larger than women and just maintaining biomass is an increase on calorie demand therefore a calorie burner. On the other side of the coin, women have other biological goals than men do and that would be to have reserves in order to support the creation, development and birth of children as well as provide those children with milk.
Pelosi's office said the CBO score is now expected Tuesday instead of Monday.Once they have a bill, Dems need to post it online for at least 72 hours for members to review before a vote. They could post this Monday, but more likely it'll be Tuesday. And it'll probably be continuously tweaked as the bill is examined for potential Byrd Rule challenges, CBO scoring conflicts and other rules hiccups. This is not a House rule, but rather a Democratic caucus pledge, one that has been broken in the rush to vote in the past, so it's up to the discretion of the leaders if they want to observe it. But, given that they need as much time as possible to whip votes it seems likely that the full 72 hours will be observed.
Why start off a rough patch by thinking that it will never get any better no matter what you do? When you're trying to work through problems and issues, you will want to make sure that you're going into it with a positive attitude. You don't need to be sugary sweet, but you should start to look at your troubles as learning lessons rather than the doom of the relationship. Try to think about happier times when you start to become negative in order to turn your thinking around.
i never meant to go travelling, I just went. You start moving and can't stop, and when you do the inertia swells in your head like sea until the tides take you off again.I'm loving reading other peoples stories on travelblog and find it a really amazing place to research where i want to go in future, as well as just hearing normal peoples lives, away from the filtered and edited rubbish we are fed by the tourism industry and the cliched 'travel' sections of Sunday newspapers.
His small wooden boat was being lashed with rain and wind. Our ferry journey started as a cheerful trip but now we had fallen silent, soaked and slightly seasick from the side to side pounding. The barefoot captain and his swarthy crew were gripping the oversized longtail motor harder than ever to keep us on track toward the small island outcrop of Koh Chang Noi where two countries meet and tropical storms swell up from the Indian ocean.
My name is Andy Carvin, and I'm part of the team that coordinates NPR's online communities. You may remember that I wrote a blog post several months ago talking about the possibility of creating a new space for members of the My Cancer community that would give them new ways to interact and support each other. Today, we're launching that new space. It's called Our Cancer.
A trial separation may allow the spouse who wants the divorce to experience some of the feelings of being separated without making a final decision to divorce. The main advantage of a trial separation, of course, is that it's easily reversible. You can try it for a while, go through counseling, and then reconcile, or you can try separation for a while, decide you like it - and then proceed with divorce.
This past week has seen a flurry of activity folks, if for no other reason than my recent trip down to Bishkek, our capital, in the warm Chui Valley. While up in Naryn we’ve endured the ravages of the -30 F cheelde (which has finally chicked) and a powerfully battering of snow, the weather in Bishkek has been considerably less intense. Their winter has been marked by only a little snow, a certain amount of rain, and temperatures that might surprise you. During this trip, while we were still below freezing in Naryn, daytime temps in Bishkek rose to a, granted unseasonably warm, 45 degrees.
Many people start to question their own sanity for ever having loved such a beast in the first place. And whether you like it or not, you need to go back in your head to find that person you did love way back when. That can go a long way toward a little bit of reality. If the person you married was a good person then, they're probably still a good person, just not showing it at the moment.
This afternoon the fun will begin with an anticipated Congressional Budget Office score followed by a House Budget Committee markup of the reconciliation amendments that will become the shell that the Senate bill will be added to as an amendment. Presumably, as soon as they're done Chairman Spratt will go to the floor. As a privileged piece of legislation, he must deliver it directly to the floor where it'll be numbered and reported out. Under House rules, the report takes two calendar days before it can be referred to the Rules Committee.The House Democratic caucus meets as Dems whip for votes.
Eating the desired food is crucial for your wellbeing. You can try supplementing your diet with acai berry, it's not solely a widely tested and acknowledged weight loss product, it's a superfood too. There is a risk free trial offered at http://nogimp.newwellbeing.info I have been taking it for 3 weeks now and it is definately working!!
While this was all going on in the background, I pushed it away and did my best to enjoy all the good things that were going on around me, blessed with the support of my wonderful wife Dianne who continues to give me her strength. So it's a new year now and I am back to work and trying to figure out how to deal with an advancing cancer that will limit the time I have left.  I wish all of you the very best in the new year and ask that you throw some good wishes my way.
Talk to your ex-spouse the way you want them to talk to you, and you have a better chance of getting what you want. Talk to them in a condescending, angry, blaming tone and I promise you will not get what you want.
Start going after the drug companies regulate there spending The price of pharmaceuticals is outrageous!!!! The other one to go after is the providers! How can every hospital in the country constantly be expanding they have over priced staff and in most cases over staffed. The quality of care does not need to be lessened it needs to be monitored not OVER COMPENSATED What is the average salary of a drug Representative? EXACTLY!!!
Are you in a tough spot in your marriage right now? Every relationship has its problems and its rough patches, but that doesn't mean that you need to give up when the going gets tough. For many couples, they can actually work through their problems to create a stronger relationship. Sometimes the hard times are actually learning lessons in disguise. Here are just a few tips for getting started on the right foot.
Cooling down with a little fun. If you need a break from the mayhem, head across the street to Bugis Junction and relax by the fountain. If you’re feeling hot join the kids and frolic in the impeccably timed water dancing about.
We all know that the BJP is a dying breed. These changes have been made like giving a person the last blood transfusion. Soon you will see infighting in the partyand the crash of this new team.
Its very cosmatic, like a old dying lady being painted up for the world to take notice of herand think she is a young bride.
BJP have brought down their party of their own doings and the fall is very near.
Its going to be a uphill taks for Mr Nitin Gadkari to hold the party together.this is a bullshit

Aishu alias “KP”(guess what?  ) alias Demagogue s one of my closest nd best frnds nd the first person to tie me a rakhi  Always the source of support..
Honest, good-at-heart, highly conservative(!!), studious(first bencher and favorite of staff!),passionate about programming and slightly submissive (she likes male chauvinists or even those who pose so  guys note it down!) – but trust me she s not the girl u assume her to be  
An epitome of friendship (u can call yourself lucky if she “really” counts you as her close friend!) and its funny when she gets angry  coz its so easy to make her laugh uncontrollably, the very next second…One person out there who is good and always tries to be so! Quite a trusty person (lol good that she is..she knows FAR too much about me!) and one who respects others’ opinions!
U can really bank on her as a friend to sort out things for u when in need of help!I will surely miss this frnd and sister a LOT, after leaving SSN!
Wishing you a gr8 future!
Arun
hmmm.. raju ju ju.. viji attesting in her close friend's testimonial... me and raj started transfering friendship in college.... really he is an all in all azhagu raju attracting not only girls but also guys.. everyone come behind him... such a nice, naughty and lovely characters he is having...
i dont want to attest him has cute.., smart.., chocolaty.., handsome.., awesome.., perfect square.., bindaas and all... instead i can say.... " just see my friend raju's photo" that will do more...
hmmm cool.., he is nice tablist.. not like zakir ussain.., but talented in his own way..
he is very very friendly than anyone else.., the stunning matter i found in him and i never seen such a lovely character in anyone else.. give you example now.., whenever he felt like missing contacts of friends he use to call and say 
" yenna da machi contact ye illa"..
see everyone say like this.. but not within four days.. he couldn't even tolerate four days.. that type of friend he is...
She redefines the laws of thermodynamics:
a) Her food intake is like normal people but she spends infinite energy talking, chatting, debating, arguing, singing, dancing, organizing events, orkuting/facebooking (throwing chappals and kickin in rajinikanth's style),...studying too now a days;) ......wonder how she creates the additional energy!
b) When alone (with say X :P), she cares about everything....wants everything to be perfect, everything to be organized, and everything to be planned....and more so than often she gets them to be....

she lives life kingsize and would do anything to keep ppl around her as happy as her!
The next morning when Swapna logged in she had forgotten completely about the surprise and they were chatting about random things as the conversation went by. Ram did not bother to remind her either. Swapna quickly typed, “We are going to have a huge bash for Anisha’s birthday tomorrow at her place. We couldn’t have a party that day ‘cos she had plans with her family.” Ram exclaimed, “Wow, that’s awesome sweety…. So, you are gonna be at her place all day tomorrow eh?” 

Swapna giggled to herself and replied, “Why do you ask like you’re going to come to the party? ;)” Ram sighed heavily on the other side and keyed in, “How I wish babe… how I wish……” They continued and she went on and on about what she had planned for the party. Ram was missing all the action and he felt bad about it. Ram typed out in frustration, “Damn! Semester ended yesterday and if only I could afford to get to India :( :(.” Swapna asked anticipating a positive response, “Is there no way you can come now?” Ram made a quick and short reply, “Nope.”

Swapna was now asking Ram what else they could do. Swapna asking him for some ideas for the party. Ram said his mood wasn’t ok and he logged off. Swapna tried to persuade him to stay, but, he refused and left. Swapna was missing him online and she was suddenly reminded of the surprise that he had promised. She was now very curious to know what it was and she called him. The conversation was very terse. Ram answered the call and in a very depressed tone replied, “I will call you tomorrow. I know you were reminded of the surprise I promised you. I’ll let you know tomorrow. Waiting at times increases the value of the surprise. Hold on to your curiosity sweety.” Without waiting for her to reply, he hung up.
Yes, i know its been looong time since i blogged or even logged into wordpress.Now am back and taking a resolution(? lets see how long it lasts) to update my blog ‘regularly’.So a quick update on what i was doing all these days.I must admit work was not that hectic though there were occasional long streches.On the travelling front i was frequenting more to home (3, even 4 times a month) from August till now.When i go home, i enjoy the few minutes i spend with my 1 month old yet-to-be-named niece. Suggestions for name welcome as i gotto be naming her officially given the status of ‘mama’ 

On otherside of life been involved with several things i relish. Premanand and me took a Ubuntu Installation ‘hands on’ workshop  @ SSNLUG in an effort to retrive the sleeping club.Presenting something for the first time to a complete set of new audience was a thrilling experience that too with 0 preparation.Pics are here. Post about that coming soon! . As part of extended work been looking into CCNET and just being amazed the way it does everything and the way its written. At home been looking into Google data Contacts API for doing something. Last week went to barcamp chennai (Yes will post one on that seperately) and to sum up in a word its ‘awesome!!!’. Again going to diwali for this weekend for a 3 day holiday.

Reminding myself on what am supposed to write after this post sometime soon.

I helped build Blogger between 1999 and 2001. I've been keeping my weblog -- onfocus.com -- since 1998. I co-wrote a book about weblogs with Meg Hourihan and Matt Haughey from the old Blogger crew; it's called We Blog: Publishing Online with Weblogs"
adt divya....ill say n my simple words......
usually ill not write testimonials anal....but dis girl tends me 2 write.....
pretty gud character with good thoughts and dreams.....
(i thnk dis is enufh 2 prove u)
Been months since i logged into wordpress.So what was keeping me busy? Well a lot of things. Work got tighter on and off, forcing to stretch for project deliveries.But a lot of other activities also took my time. Playing TT at office in the evenings was a great exercise and stress buster.

I typed the above sometime in July and i stopped it and didnt publish that time.So what else is keeping me going? Justifying that i was busy at work all along the year will be a lie, though it can attribute to 50%. So what are the other acitivities that i did? Apart from work, been doing quite few things that bring in some satisfaction. Be it hanging around with busroutes.in guys and making some tiny contribution in python/php/testing or literally roaming around the streets for mapping e-city / hosur or attending the Wikipedia Meetup 3 and getting hooked into it or making my first article appear on the DYK section of the main page or participating in Wikipedia takes Chennai, it was all pure fun and learning. Came across a bunch of awesome people in the process of doing these things. Been to college couple of times during the alumni meet and then for software freedom day, it was just refreshing to breathe the “old air”. So stressed office schedules + Parallel activities like above + travelling home twice a month leaves no time for blogging. I have been tweeting heavily though for quite sometime now. Follow me there. Hope i will update this blog soon and will not keep it idle for a year.

Chiputu is how i call this 'thin frame' if i dont call him Hari. Some of the things that comes to my mind when i think about him:

1. He is always seen doing bowling actions at home.
2. Always on phone.
3. A mini google - I dont know how he gathers information about someone. But he seem to know everyone and about everyone. :)
4. Positive guy.
5. Cannot drive a two wheeler with gears. (Sorry Hari)

The only thing i dont like about him is the fact that he likes the actor Vijay.

I am new to Orkut and hence dont know if i can come back and add few more sentences about him. If not, i will conclude saying that he is a sweet chap and a great friend.
CONTINUATION...
today,after almost 8 yrs since then i find him with the same energy and verve...everfresh and cheerful.he has been thro' my thick and thin all these years(and i badly needed him,more so, during my lean periods to guide me through)..he gives everything to keep his friends and loved ones (oops! sorry) loved one i meant happy.he has been my mentor in almost all walks of my life(except for cricket though where its the other way round..hehehe..no jus joking.he is a great batsman and i adore him there too).he is good at managing situations,his arguments are unbeatable..his smile goes a mile and settles ur nerves.well for all the attributes that he has got,to have his head firmly resting on his shoulders is something that is worth a mention...
and now to the critic part of it..
he is too fussy about his food(jus like me though)...he is a bit lazy is an understatement..and he never lies..ya he weighs 65kg and afridi is the best cricketer in the world.
thanx for being the way you are da..
Additionally, we cannot cross-sell or up-sell products to high net worth individuals because there is no 360-degree view of the customer available to us. Therefore to begin with, UTI Mutual Fund will invest in CRM for service support, and later move to integrate sales and marketing,” concludes Reddy.

Says Rajesh Ghosh, Vice-president and General Manager, Sage Accpac India, “You should know who the top 20 percent of your customers are, and you’ve got to make sure you retain them. You’ve got to find the reasons why they are with you, why they are paying premium prices, why they may have a lot of accounts and how you created value in that relationship to make switching either too expensive or undesirable.

I sailed into the gymnasium with forced enthusiasm and despite the few odd muscle catches that occurred, by the end of my two hours there was a definite sense of improved condition. The bounce came back, the heat of the morning sun on the lawn was welcomed and the entire day has been spent in spasmless wonder !! I wore a new dress. I changed my watch. I wore a pair of shoes that had been ignored for long. I attended to my car repair personally. While driving to Jalsa I reprimanded a traffic offender. I sang along with the FM radio jock as one of my favorites belted itself out from the speakers on the car. I checked the electricals in the house that were giving us a problem. I unpacked and laid out the various gifts presented to me from the Oman Excellencies. I fixed my computer, discovering during the course that I had been using the wrong cable box for my internet connection. I made calls to people that I had been avoiding for sometime. And … I watched the IPL with great delight…

Interest in Norton's take on things, and any reference to him returning becomes a major conversation, and I hope Marvel pays attention to all of that energy being spent.  I think it's really Marvel's decision at this point, not Norton's, and Marvel will make it a priority if they are told, loud and clear, "This is a priority."  They could easily write around Norton or replace him, but I think that would be a creative misstep.  When you have a collaborator who is this smart, and this willing, you shouldn't walk away.  You should embrace them, even if that means doing some difficult things and making some choices that cede some power.  Marvel is being incredibly smart about the films they control these days, and they have a chance to line up a truly great cast when the Avengers assemble.
Yesterday i was sitting and waiting for few friends in a Chinese restaurant. Waiting is the annoying thing I happen to do very often since I am always ahead of time. So now my friends are partially to be blamed for my habit. I end up catching a conversation between a 40 something year old man and a 12 to 14 year old boy. The book I was trying to read was bad anyway. I heard the dad asking his son about school and friends. That grabbed my attention. The son patiently answered like he really wanted to share. How many teenagers do that? (Not like i am the 40 year old dad) Then the topic turned to women. Father asked if the son liked anyone in school. The son just giggled. I wanted to pull that kid’s cheeks. Now lets just focus on non creepy side of me.

Even though we might change and we might part finding our own places in the world, we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face, we'll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us, nothing will ever change so much to the point where we're not all still friends.
We believe that while investments in ERP will continue, many large businesses are buying additional user-licences and modules as they expand their operations and networks. Says Ravi Kathuria, Director, Marketing and Solutions, SSA Global India, “We find a good percentage (over 50 percent) of our business coming from repeat orders from these large enterprises in the form of additional user-licences and functionality modules including HR and payroll. This is because their transactions have grown along with capacities and sales.”
Shiv Gaad, the biggest flirt I know...besides me, of course. I like one thing about this dude - He is a hedonist. He is always looking out to have fun. So, if you are with him, chances are you will have fun too. (even more so if you are a girl ;)). He is a little bit of a wannabe but certainly tolerable. Btw, if you are not friends with Shiv yet, you should want to become friends with him since I feel Shiv is great with people whom he is just getting to know. He will ignore you after he knows you well enough. :-) 
(the latter is not true but the former is)
No, I am not going to write about what I think of God. But, I am going to talk about the gods hanging on our walls. Everyone has a calendar to give you at the beginning of the new year which has the most beautiful of god pictures on them. So, you find it cute, get it home, put it on your desk, hang it on the wall.

After a year, when it has collected dust (ok maybe yours does not, mine does!) and has faded, what do you do about it?

I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2010, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make our country great (not to imply that India is necessarily greater than any other country) and without regard to the race, creed, color, age, physical ability, religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee.
Make sure you utilize all the company contribution. For example, if the company is matching contribution 100% for the first 1% and 50% for 5% of your contribution, choose your contribution to be 6% at the very least. If conditions favor, choose maximum contribution allowed by IRS, 15,500 for 2007. This will increase by $500 for the next few years as per a law passed in the congress.
Ok … so a lesson has been learnt ! Never talk too soon ! Talked yesterday on how positivity had changed my condition and how fantastic I was feeling … hmm .. rubbish ! Nothing worked today ! Ha .. The pain was back, gym was a torture and an entire day spent in lamenting the uselessness of life. Nothing to discourage readers or to deflate their enthusiastic reactions to yesterdays blog, but … ya … just feel when you talk about it, it does not work. Better to do, than to open your mouth about it.
Many would disagree though. Not speaking up, a sign of weakness they would proclaim. But in this instance, I would rather go with what I have generally felt. We must do, others to talk on what we do. And its not important that what we do is talked about. So long as the reason for what we do, are taken in beneficially to the person for whom we do. Cause and reason should know. Not who contributed to the cause or reason. Better this way.

It has been our pleasure to have Collection Services, Inc taking care of our bad debt collections for over 20 years.
On more than one occasion, we have measured CSI's results against other agencies. CSI has consistently delivered excellent results.
   Another area that sets CSI apart from others is their customer service. They have a proven record of collecting bad debt while treating our patients with respect. In the very few instances that we have received negative feedback about CSI from one of our patients, CSI's response and resolution has always been immediate and professional.
   Rarely does a vendor understand and remain so committed to such a mutually beneficial relationship. CSI operates as a true partner. CSI also provides reports through their website, and they are always able to accommodate any of our requests for special information in a timely manner.
John, really you and Shankar have driven these change improvement initiatives by identifying critical business needs.  So, I greatly appreciate both of you having the passion, drive and interest to continuously improve our IT operations in the Rice Building.

Now the harder part is actually delivering results and implementing high-impact solutions for our stakeholders -- Jim, Prof Shanley, Mary, Shari, Rita, etc.... so that they can recognize the decision and efforts were worthwhile.
Mirror, mirror on d wall who's the strongest of them all!!! The one, the only Ankit Rana.
But if scrape through the tough exterior you will come across a heart of gold. The problem is not many guys have d guts to do so but those who do r blessed with a buddy for d rest of their lifetime, fortunately i am one of them.
When he's not humiliating the machines at our gym, he's gaming or going berserk on his bike or biting into delicious delicacies or checking out d cars of the world over or, and this he does d most, being a support system to his pals ( excusive rights of entry into this club lie solely on his whims n fancies!!!LOLZ).
Let not his amazing sense of humour fool you into believing that he isn't focussed, he knows exactly where his destination lay, its just that he does not make a hullabaloo of it like d many other people you might have met.
Repaying you in d sholay spirit "Khali":-

I agree. No one has the right to tell you what to do, how to do things. Anything we do or say, ppl will criticize. What you do right might be wrong to someone else, hence criticism is constantly alive. I would channel those criticize into positive advice and keep your ear opens. Don't shut out these criticism. Criticism is a way of seeing yourself in a different perspective. And I feel twitter, blogging has given the celebrities (singers, actors) a whole new medium to connect to their fans. I'm glad they are doing it. Because I wouldn't be able to praise Shahrukh Khan about his latest movie if it wasn't for him being in Twitter or I wouldn't be able to tell you how much I loved your " O Aiiye" song from Ayan.
Everyone’s in shock over what happened to the Lankan team. None more so than the Taliban/LeT. They are utterly shocked that the rest of us assumed sportsmen would not be targeted.

This was after the Lankan team was promised President-level security. Really? If this is the protection President-level security gets you, I don’t blame Zardari for signing that pre-emptive deal with the Taliban.

No more sports in the country. If it’s any consolation, Pakistan can continue playing mind games with India and ‘double-games’ with the US.

Yep. A call intercepted by the CIA confirmed that the Pakistani military is still actively supporting the Taliban. So Pakistan is happily absorbing billions in free aid whilst merely pretending to help America in return. Kinda like AIG, when you think about it.

It’s been 2 days and no real leads. Zardari has assured everyone that the state is the doing the best it can. Sure, but no resignations. None so far. Shivraj Patil was not reachable for comment.
62 years have paused and many teams have been formed and yet the congress cannot even think of a democratic set up as yet. Performance, if you measure in terms of increase in the growth of BPL families over these period , is no solace either. Neither can you boast of a free and fair society when the terror is lurking on your head at any moment and the economic growth that is being tomtomed is confined only to a few business houses growing richer and richer while the divide between the haves and have-nots is growing wider. Whereas you are questioning the new team of BJP where there is atleast the democracy at its root. Please give them the breathing time and then judge their performance rather than anticipating miracles overnight.
Shaggy as i would like u to him is one i would easily compare with one of my greatest friends , let me tell you he knows how to be himself though he tends to break up sometimes. he has been there as my locker .mostly cool and calm.you'll not realise he's there with u untill he breaks his silence with his good mokais . he pretty much knows everything abt me .and wow a great dude to hang out with.. macha u rock.. and almost forgot to tell u ppl ..we share the twin passion .. BIKES and SPEED... roll on buddy

Sri Lanka's cricket history is replete with fast bowlers, both in the pre-Test era and after, but they have never produced anyone of genuine pace, although many believe DS Jayasundera, a right-arm fast bowler in the 1930s and 40s, was genuinely sharp, and there have been none faster since.
Sometimes, I can't help but feel that it's a 'Truman show' happening here for me at Moscow. Wake up at the same time, have the same breakfast ( not too many veg options) - infact, when I call 'Room service' the lady says ' Oh yes sir, I know what you'll have for breakfast', have a pick up taxi at 11 (most of the times its the same taxi driver), pass by the hotel receptionist who says the customary "Good morning", try to engage in some conversation with the taxi driver, keep looking out of the taxi window trying to identify the way(though we always take the same route, I always tend to find it new everyday), say hi to the russian colleagues, go for lunch at 15h00 sharp and have the same dish (again very few veggie options), try to engage in conversations with the russians colleagues, have a taxi back at 8, hot shower in the evening, have the same dinner(no more mentioning about the kinda food I get) , watch CNN and eurosport(watch the Sheffield Snooker championship) on TV ( only english channels) till about 12 in the night and hit the bed - AND this over and again for 5 consecutive days. Woah - the story of my life in the past week.
There are many things that I missed posting when I was back in India. One among them is this post.Being in SSN, the rules and restrictions of other similar colleges seemed so weird. When one would talk about the rules and restrictions of such colleges, I have often thought that it is either a rumour or an exaggeration. One of such rules that you may see is the formal dress code of engineering colleges. Such rules exist in most colleges. Some of certain rules are wearing absolute formal dress like pants and tucked in shirts. If that is not enough, some restrictions are also imposed. One of the worst cases would be asking the students to wear only light colored shirts and asking them not to wear black. Few of my friends happened to go to one of the college to distribute promotional posters of our department symposiums and they had happened to go to such college by wearing a tee shirt and jeans. One of the security guards didn't let them go until they proved that they were students from other college. There is also an instance I heard that the security guard didn't let one person with a tee shirt to enter the college and that person ended to be the father of a student studying in that college. There is one rule that exists that gives you a glance of the upper limit of stupidity of engineering colleges. That is the rule of asking boys to not speak to girls and vice versa.
hmmmm ... this guys ma friend for almost a year now ... whenever we meet a guy whos jus like us we feel this guy is the rit person to share fun , emotions and everythin n this guys one of them ...a very cool , exciting , always active , stupid , DAWG .... ma best friend .. mama and evthin ... lol . Hey nee gethuu macha ..
(he told me to write all this ) :p ....
I guess I am little late in wishing you all a Happy Pongal but yet the festival season isn’t over yet. So I wish you all a Happy Pongal and a Happy Tamil New Year as well! I guess I am late in posting the first post this year too. It is pretty surprising that I am into my fifth year of my blogging. The journey continues. As far as my blogging goes, it goes pretty slowly at the moment. But it seems just like last month, I stepped into SSN College of Engineering. Now I am just a part of the SSN alumni. Last week, they had conducted a wonderful tribute to the SSN alumni and I really appreciate that, even though missing it by thousands of miles. Every year, we look into the rest with a new hope, trying to build a future that has been carved perfectly in our minds. We try to recreate that model. Sometimes we fail but sometimes we win. Some people drive with the hope of winning. Some drive with the fear of losing. The former is preferred as when driving a car, you go with the intention to go to the destination safely and you don’t drive with the fear of crashing. Again ‘Safety’ is a weird word and I need to use it carefully. ‘Safety’ is closely associated with fear and it is contradicting my opinion. The positive hope is what drives us forward but at the same time, we need to have a small touch of fear that helps us defend ourselves to whatever obstacles we are facing on the journey ahead.
Achu hmmm first thing that comes to mind is discipline( he is always late by ten to fifteen mins for any work).. sincere(this is not restricted just to studies).. hardworking he is, jst loves burning the midnight oil and makes sure the other guy(it was me back in school) also loses sleep.. 4ams were a routine

beach,movies,football,basketball,tv,pc games,Mcrennet,zeta jones,411 if i can recollect r some of his fav pasttimes and hangouts.. and now he has a bike so imagine and yet he finds time to study.. i feel sad tht v dint end up in the same coll

he has his own principles and his own ways of doing things and one has to respect him for tht.. when im down i do get some advice from him... very trustworthy and reliable... im sure he will make it big in the future..

finally, bcos ur name appears first in my cell contacts and Y! messenger list(as it is for others) guys mistake it for some girl's and i get to be a bit popular and maintain some level of 'gethu'... one good reason to remain ur friend :-)

Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass isn't going to be in theaters for over a month, but it premiered last night at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival to huge success. When ComingSoon.net/SuperHeroHype spoke with the movie's stars, Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, we weren't too surprised to learn there's already talk about a Kick-Ass 2 at least in terms of a second volume from creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. 

We'll have a full review soon, but what's interesting about Vaughn's movie is that it starts and ends almost exactly like the first 8-issue volume of the comic series, so it essentially leaves Vaughn in a place where he could take what Millar and Romita do in a second volume and adapt it directly onto the big screen as a sequel.
Nithin a lovable friend of mine. i used to share him many matters. he too shares with me his views.

I'm a web developer from Lincoln, NE. I kind of fell into programming, working with a friend in the mid 90's, trying to figure out what this internet thing was all about.<br><br>		In college I was an economics major, a subject that is still of great interest to me.

New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum is keen to put the lessons learned from a difficult 2009 IPL into practice during this year's tournament.

McCullum is in the middle of a home series against Australia. New Zealand lost the Chapell-Hadlee series 3-2 and the teams will meet in Wellington on Friday for the first of two Test matches. With the 2010 IPL successfully underway amongst security fears, McCullum is still waiting on clearance before confirming his involvement but was eager to participate in the competition because of its massive impact on the cricketing world.
Here we go...the testi of my friend from 7th standard....AN ABSOLUTE GEM OF A GIRL....very kind hearted,a great friend to have...people think she is a very soft character but she isnt..we only know about it...ppl watch out...lolz... But when you are close to her she is the BEST i tell you...ALL THE BEST...
The last few days have been an emotional rollercoaster for the team behind the show. The producer of the show Roshni Menon died twenty days before the opening night leaving them completely shocked and shattered. Until they realised that the best tribute they could give their friend was make her dream come true.

“We had the first audition on the first weekend of November, and had a callback in the second weekend and started rehearsals by the third week. But before the rehearsals, I spoke to Shaun Roberts to get the music ready and Mike (Michael Muthu) about the set design,” recalls Denver.
Lakshmi a.k.a motorrrrr..the world's greatest talking machine...she can talk-talk-talk like
forever..i think she talks even when shez asleep..get her started and u'll find tht u wudnt have

With that never ending talk comes the laughter part..again..she can't stop laughing..she laughs even for the most idiotic jokes and its real tough to stop her..but once she stops,she'll start talking again.. argghhh!!makes u wonder whr tht mouth came from..
Barring all tht.. shez a fantastic person.. real friendly and has an ultra positive perspective towards life..very bold considering all the things shez been thro.. shez also brilliant in studies and a master of the "memory mapping" technique..fun loving,trustworthy(who says she cant keep secrets?!),caring,gregarious,level-headed and damn helpful.. she never takes things to heart despite being the butt of all our jokes..
Thanks for being a great pal!! "motorr" rocks!!

The year 2009 is coming to an end. Many of my batchmates would agree with me that we would have thought about 2009 for so long. I wondered, in 2005, how 2009 would be because just like 2003 and 2005, we always know that 2009 is going to be a big year, atleast for our batch. Now the year 2009 has almost come to an end. Yes it did make one of the most important changes in my life. 2009 is a tag for us. If we wish to go back to SSN or attend an alumni function, we would be calling ourselves 2009 passouts. I would be referred as Kavin of 2009 batch. Kavin CSE ‘A’ is all gone. It is going to be Kavin of 2009. Lol. Every one of our batch mates would have known that they were travelling in the same road of education until 2009. It is in 2009 we departed, each taking our own ways. Some went on for jobs, business, and some want to travel in the same path of education. I belong to the latter. Looking back 2009, it has been a great year for TAGS. It gained popularity which spread like wild fire. More people came to adopt and we were able to do it really fast. This day happens to be the Second Anniversary of TAGS. I wish TAGS all success throughout.
If u see dasavataram in each and every frame kamal will be there dominating the scene which is unlike his movies where he gives his co-actors are  also given a chance to dominate like in  Anbe Sivam,Virumandi and much of his movies.But in dasavataram it was purely Kamal and no one else though Asin was there she didn't do a great deal.And it paid out for Kamal.Dasavatharam is the biggest blockbuster of the year and the only blockbuster in Kollywood. When we come to Rajini he used to be in every frame of the movie and his fans and all other people would love him for his punch dialogues,style and fight sequences.But when you take Kuselan Pasupathi would be in every frame of the movie and Rajini would have dominated the climax where he makes everyone cry.Padayappa is a rare exception but in that movie also he was there full length while in Kuselan he was there only for 55 mins and in Chandramukhi Jyothika dominated only the last 20 mins other parts it was full of Rajini. But unfortunately it didn't pay off for rajini as Kuselan ws one of the major flops of the year along with Bheema and Kuruvi.And Rajini is asked to pay the debts for the loss occued which is really sad because when his film were huge hit no one came and and give him the share he is eligible for but when it is a flop he is asked to pay the debts.  Only one thing is clear from this .For a masala actor it is difficult to give a hit if he doesn't dominate whereas for an actor who gives his co-actors  a chance the people like it any way he acts if the film is good.
