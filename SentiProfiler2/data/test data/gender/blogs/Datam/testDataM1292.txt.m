Sometime in December I decided to find out how long it would take to put together a set by simply buying wax packs. Of course, the holidays were fast approaching, so this became a project for after the madness passed. And now here we are. A few days ago, I put out a message on Facebook/Twitter asking for help: Which set should I put together? The choices were 1981 Fleer, 1990 Topps, 1991 Topps, 1992 Upper Deck, 1994 Fleer, and a random 1980s Topps sticker set. I got a lot of response, mostly choosing a sticker set (5 votes), 1981 Fleer (2 votes), or 1990 Topps (2 votes). After much deliberation, here's the set I'll be aiming to complete: 1982 Topps Stickers. I chose 1982 because of the availability of unopened sticker packs and unused sticker albums. After I complete the sticker album, I will attempt to complete 1991 Topps, a set I never liked and never bought when it came out. After 1991 Topps, who knows. Here are the rules: No trading. No buying of opened lots on eBay. I will only buy packs. I also plan on tracking sticker/card sequencing in packs. I will then fill in each page of the sticker album as best I can. I still haven't figured out what to do with the sticker doubles, but I think some sort of public art around Boston will be on tap.
