Good news. I'm just back from my 6 monthly appointment with my rheumatologist. When I arrived the nurses asked if I was settling back into Lincolnshire life after that famous holiday. They wanted to know where I'd been to do so much to my liver and were so amused that i had been staying in a convent in Jerusalem. Cue jokes about communion wine. They asked if anyone had commented on last weeks blood test and I said "No not yet". So she looked it up and said that it wasn't really good news because the liver results were a little bit higher yet. Good job she'd taken my blood pressure before telling me that. But when I saw the consultant he wasn't bothered at all. He has agreed that I can reduce the methotrexate to just 4 per week and is happy with how my joints are looking. I specifically asked about the liver results and he said he thought they were more likely caused by the diabetes. When I had last weeks blood test I also had the tests for my annual diabetes review and apparantly my cholestral is raised. He didn't comment on the rest of the diabetic tests so that is a joy I have for next week when i have the review. I have never taken my diabetes seriously because I've always had enough to worry about with arthritis but now that is under control I know I'll have to think diabetes. I've only stopped eating chocolate because of the wish to lose weigh and the weght loss blog so you can see I have to rethink quite seriously. Maybe it's time I also joined the diabetes blog!!!! Well I'd have an extra glass of wine to celebrate but it's weigh in day tomorrow so have to watch the calories!
