Hi everyone, I bought the 1" solia flat iron about 3 weeks ago because I wanted a flat iron that straightens my hair as fast as it can curl it, and is not as heavy as my Conair flat iron.I came to find out though that it doesn't straighten my hair as fast and it does tug on my ends a little.I have it on about 350 because i have thin hair and i dont want it to break as much but i still have to go over pieces of hair about 3 times. I really like however , how it curls my hair with only one slow time of going through a piece, but it does leave the hair dry afterwards.
So if you want a flat iron to just straighten your hair you might want to get another one that is way cheaper and does the same job. I cant complain about the curling part, though, so I just straighten my hair with the Conair and curl it with this one.. so this is my hair after straightening it with the Solia 1"-took me 20 min.
