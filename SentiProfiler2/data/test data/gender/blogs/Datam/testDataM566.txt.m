It has been our pleasure to have Collection Services, Inc taking care of our bad debt collections for over 20 years.
On more than one occasion, we have measured CSI's results against other agencies. CSI has consistently delivered excellent results.
   Another area that sets CSI apart from others is their customer service. They have a proven record of collecting bad debt while treating our patients with respect. In the very few instances that we have received negative feedback about CSI from one of our patients, CSI's response and resolution has always been immediate and professional.
   Rarely does a vendor understand and remain so committed to such a mutually beneficial relationship. CSI operates as a true partner. CSI also provides reports through their website, and they are always able to accommodate any of our requests for special information in a timely manner.
