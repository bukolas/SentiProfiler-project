I appreciate the mums for the color and long season they bring to the late summer and fall gardens. I am not particularly knowledgeable about them nor do I care to be...  for me it's simply a matter of planting them, shearing them a few times through July 4th (at least twice, but I prefer three if I get around to it), and watching them bloom. I know I should hand 'pinch' them to help them fill out, but I just don't care to spend that much time on the chore... hedge shears work for me and after a bit of time has passed, any stems that were missed will grow beyond the main body of the plant... that's when I hand pinch those stems. As I said... I think it's time to divide them and spread them about the gardens, so I will go for that this spring.
I'm sitting here at eleven thirty at night thinking about what to write. I started to write something but it wasn't "Gigglemedicine" appropriate. I'm not trying to be funny I want this blog to be natural not contrived but comedy and tragedy are connected. I could go off on a some witty examples: comedy and tragedy like Alien and Aliens, Peter Sellers and Steve Martin the Guess Who and Come back! I think you get it. 
  I was up watching "Behind Enemy Lines" on Spike. I was inspired to play with the premise:
"Apathy."  I don't know if my indifference came from watching Owen Wilson in a War movie or watching the Oilers lose their fifteenth game in a row with three seconds left. But here I am locked on indifference.
   I like the premise. If I can get up in a stage and say I feel nothing. That's a better place then being the wonky Sea Monkey - that comedian that's on auto pilot. I love comedy. Even after all these years I can hop in a 78 Taurus and burn across the prairies . I'm not worried about the destination. God will tell me the punch line.
   I've never really thought about being discovered. And what does that mean? Like how hard was it for that guy who discovered the Moon? "There's Ted he pointed up."
I've had twenty plus years in Comedy I teach it and I still feel like my big  comedy discoveries
 are in front of me- I know what they are: letting go, moving into the unknown, rehearsing, being prepared. I'll keep chipping away it's right around the corner inside a 78 Taurus.
How many memories carries on this jewel of Submarine. It left London on January 15, 1944 to sail for the Pacific Ocean to join up with the war. It arrived in Pearl Harbor on Valentine's Day, the most romantic day, where you will think about the loved one, while you need to face an incoming war.
The crew onboard was prepared as much as possible for the dangerous experience that lay ahead and that they will face during the next days. During that period, for night and days, drills were conducted in the warm waters around Hawaii where torpedoes were fired and gun crews drilled and Pampanito even suffered a depth charging.
Exactly one year after, on March 15, 1944, her keel was laid down at Portsmouth, Pampanito left on her first patrol. 

I have to say that going inside a submarine for my 1st time was an experiece that I could never forget. You put yourself in a marine's shoes. You are inside, the vent-hole is closing. You re going underneath the surface, ready for the battle, not sure if you will see your beloved again. You are there! There is few little space for you to move! And you need to move fast if you do not want to be the bombarded and destroyed!
I was traveling by a public transport this evening of 17th Feb 2010. It was crowded. Hundreds of strangers packed in one iron box(bus). They were breathing over each others shoulders yet complete strangers. People. Thankfully I was sitting by the window seat. While I was looking at the people I was completely taken aback with one thought that hit me.
The only thing in my life that I have not seen getting exhausted are the "people". They are everywhere. Every day and every point of a life thriving on this planet. I remember observing and wondering at People when I was a little unknown kid. The old aged people I used to see when I was a kid are still trudging here in gray. The young beautiful girls of teens and 20s are still running around in colors. The little noisy kids are still going to schools and playing in the playgrounds. The middle aged working men are still tuned with their robotic lives. The shopping, gossiping women are still here. I have been growing up since 24 years and I have seen so many things getting exhausted. The huge green, cool-shaded trees are not seen anymore. The small beautiful streets are not small anymore. I don't see an intense rainy season or feel a freezing winter anymore. I don't see the radiant rainbows arcing a green valley. The childhood days aint here anymore. No more small cozy houses. They are all exhausted. But people are still here. They are everywhere. Everything has changed but for the people. Thousands die everyday and millions every year. But the people are never exhausted. They have become like a layer on the planet.
I wonder if God can find a 24year old sand grain on the beach.
I started this blog back my junior year of college. I worked at a college radio station and wanted to use another way to show my passion for college football and the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame so I started this. Why the misspelled "tho" you ask? Anyone who knows me well knows that I strongly represent the "spell check" generation and struggle at times with common spellings of words. Just a little play on words, enjoy the site and let me know if you have anything for me. Thanks for checking it out.
Last weekend on a sunday i took my wife who had just arrived in UK for a 3 week stay, on a double date with my best friend and his significant otherhalf. Ben and I took our ladies to see Cinderella on Ice, choreographed and performed by the Imperial Ice Stars, on a tour in UK for their last show that evening. Personally, whilst i was really impressed with the magical performance, the fact that i was seeing a show at the Royal Albert Hall excited me far more. I had yet given my another first time to her.

Lucky for us, as we arrived at the venue we happened to come across with a ground staff for directions, who pointed us to the helpdesk for an upgrade of our tickets for better seats; hence our getting the best seats in stalls for the price of the back row balcony seats, which wouldn't be too bad either.

As the performance went on i was wondering how figure skaters could spin 100 times at x Gs and still managed to smile and kept steadfast on the ground, well balanced on the skates afterwards?

As always i could not sleep over this anomaly as a result of not knowing, so i reached out to find an explantion:
After falling in love for Art and Photography I decided to open this Blog. I moved from Italy to Holland in 2007 for my studies, trying to find my own space within my Soul and my H-earth. This blog will be my creative expression while living here and will create new ways of seeing the Earth through the eyes of my Hearth.
I'm not saying that America is this terrible disgusting country. Well I'm not completely saying that. What I am commenting on is the the patriotism of American's that seem to always offend other countries when speaking of how great America is. You don't see African's saying look at those Indonesians starving bastards! No because it's almost like the pot calling the kettle black.
I have known Delbert for a solid 10 or 12 years now. We met at F.A.B. Church (Then Niverville M.B.) in Sr. high youth group. Delbert stands a full 6'5" tall (and as such is one of the only people I know who is as tall or taller than I am at 6'4.5"). He is 26, has dark hair which already has a fair amount of grey (likely from all of the crazy stunts he's pulled), a missing tooth on his upper jaw with a denture that he enjoys weirding kids out with, and enough experience doing so many different things that you'd think he had lived twice as long. He's currently engaged to be married to an awesome girl named Christina in June of this year, and has made the mistake of inviting me to be his "best" man.
Delbert is best known for his hunting/fishing/camping expeditions, his adventures in Paraguay, his stint as a drummer in a fizzled rock band, and his ability to smoothly transition from a full-bore cowboy get-up to a pea-coat and dress shirt in the same day.
As one of the only people that my son Rhys has listed as a friend, Delbert has most certainly found himself on the VIP list with both of my kids. They can always count on Uncle Delbert and Aunty Christina for awesome gifts at Christmas time. Two of my favourites have been my son's Carhart sweater, and my daughter's pink cowboy boots and hat. Truly stellar gifts from both a parent's perspective, and the kid's.
Del does the same thing that I do for a living: carpenter/cabinet installer. He's pretty well respected by both the company he contracts for (Kitchen Craft), and his clients. If there's one thing I've noticed, it's that he is a hard worker, and a really great guy to know if you ever need back-up.
When I bought my house in October, 2 years ago, I did some major renovating before we moved-in. Delbert just showed-up on the first night with a case of beer and a tool belt. He pretty-much was there for the full rest of the three weeks, working almost as much as I did, no need for me to ask. He's done a lot of things like that for a lot of people. I don't know any other guys who would do that, and that's maybe as much as I need to say.
Here's to Delbert (I am drinking a beer right now, and lifting it in a toast).
I am a 34 yo husband, father, health care practitioner and traveler; though not always in that order. Born in FL, raised in NY, grew up in AK and now reside in WA with my wife of 10 yrs and 2 children. I have been working in Alaska in the same field for the past 11 yrs and I still love my job. I know I am very fortunate to go places, see things and meet people that many people will never get the chance to experience.We arrived to Adak Island on September 28 and I can literally count on one hand how many nice days we've had here.  Yesterday the most recent and even though it was cold, it provided a nice clear day to take some photos.  The first shot is 6 photos stitched together for a panoramic of the town of Adak.  The other 2 photos were taken after capturing a dozen or so still shots of the young eagle.  I stood and waited for about 20 minutes waiting for it to fly off so I could capture it in flight.  I almost missed too, but the wait was worth it.  Adrian and I have one more week here before we fly back home for Christmas with the rest of the family.  I hope to get one more nice day to get more photos of all there is to see here before we return in January when there's sure to be a lot more snow a lot less time.  We'll have less daylight and add to that A season for Cod fishery and Opilio crab.  It's bound to be a busy time at the clinic.  Hope you enjoy the following pics.
Well, I'm back from the outer space that is the holiday season. I trust you all had a great holiday?

Relatively uneventful on my end - just some good times with friends and family and usually a few drinks to close out the night.

Most interesting part of the holiday was that Mrs. Shambles's grandmother is in a nursing home right now. And when we visited her, the woman she's sharing a room with, separated by a curtain, kept asking us (apparently Nancy and Bob) how the food was in Jamaica and how big the plane was and why we kept talking about Cincinnati when she knew that we lived in North Olmstead before we went to Jamaica, of course.

When we said we lived in North Carolina before that, she got totally confused.

Oh, and that one of my relatives may soon begin smoking weed due to a medical condition. 

And it was snowing and I'd had little sleep and a sugar free Red Bull, but driving back home I either saw the body of a giant sheepdog or a small Yeti.

So I guess it was a little interesting.

I wish you all the best in the coming week and year!
..The republicans are the only thing standing between Obama and a socialist 3rd world America. The health care bill is a fiscal nightmare and bodes ill for seniors. The majority of Americans don't want it else it would have already made it through; it is the die hard loyalist to Obama who cling tenaciously to a bad idea and are unwilling to let it go.
Michelle I am heartened by the progress you have revealed your sister has shown. I believe eventually you will find a way to get help for your sister. If you were in Canada or England with their socialized programs you definitely would not have a shot and would be trying to figure out how to get to America to maybe have a shot.
If that bill gets through, opportunities for resolution of complicated issues like yours will be impossible to resolve.
This is something that I have never really belonged to personally. I also think for the most part anyway this is a problem on a much smaller scale compared to the last couple topics, that eventually dissipates after leaving your high school/juvenile days behind. Yet still grouping people, labeling people, and then bashing them for ludicrous reasons is discrimination in it's child hood stages, and can still cause damage to others. I have seen first hand how the "popular crowd" really works. You're in, or you're trying your best to get in by doing everything necessary to gain acceptance. These people that try to get into these crowds usually have low confidence in themselves and will attempt to show off by insulting or belittling a different classification of person, for example "nerds", "emo", "outcasts", exc. Sometimes it could also just be the "popular" ones themselves that try to hurt others. This is considered small drama, but drama people have to live with as long as they go to school. So, something like this to the victim of this drama will build up over time...there's your damage. Not fitting in when you're desperate to, and being bashed by the desperate year round. I do realize high school isn't this kind of hell for everyone, but I'm speaking for whom this concerns. There will always be secrets, rumors, and backstabbing especially if you work your way up brutally, that's exactly how your "friends" and social life will be. 
Also another thing I would like to point out is school shootings. School shootings are often caused by these actions of immaturity. Again, if you're mean or unfair to someone consistently, it will have a terrible effect eventually. All it takes is for that person to get to their breaking point. It doesn't always have to be a school shooting; they also sometimes just kill themselves, or release their stress in many other ways. To close this up I just want to say for the wanna-be popular bitches and bastards, get over your minor insecurities, and lack of imagination or someone will get hurt!
Banksy and the Bristol Museum have recently unveiled a ground breaking installation that features a ton of new work from one of the greatest working artists in the world today. I am seriously considering making the trip to check this one out...it looks absolutely stunning.
Just watch these videos and you'll see what I mean.
People who know me well know I love baseball. I love the sounds, the smells, the nuances that make the game different than any I know. 

It's the one game that allows those with less talent and athletic ability to prevail over those with more of both through dedication, practice, patience, and desire. It's the one game that measures the person in a way that crosses over into real life.

I coached for a number of years. What I remember from those days isn't wins and losses, but the kids, their personal fears, their smiles, their triumphs, really everything about them.

One person in particular was Peter. He was kind of a fringe player, but did his best. During one game, he missed a fly ball. He broke down in the outfield and started crying. Quickly, I sent in a substitute and met him as he came off the field. 

He needed a hug, and that's what he got, right in front of the whole world. I told him I was proud of him. I told him he was good. And, I sent him back in the game. Redemption, just like that. 

In all my years as a professional, I've never had a moment like that.
While Dad is busy with my little brother in the bathtub John and I decided to try and see what we got for Christmas!

I told John to wait at the dining room doorway to let me know when Dad comes out of the bathroom while I checked our presents. I walked into the den and saw them. WOW!! There are lots of presents here!! I started looking at the presents trying to find one with the name 'Matthew', my name. I found one! Please let this be the Wii I want! I hope so! Turning it over I saw that Dad learned his lesson last year with me peeking at my gifts. There was so much tape at the ends I couldn’t peek at it without ripping the paper right off! Shoot! Maybe this is the only one. I started checking the others and saw the same thing. Shoot!

 Then I heard John behind me when he yelled "WOW!! Look at all the presents!!" I turned to John and told him he is supposed to be watching for Dad. "But its not fair! I want to see what I got too!" he said. I told him that Dad has them wrapped so good I can’t see what we got.

That was my mistake. After John yelled we should have gotten out of the den and back into the living room but we had to stand there looking at the presents and arguing. The bathroom Dad was in is across the house but he hears everything we do!

"BOYS!!!"

Crap! There was Dad holding Ian standing right behind us. I knew it without looking. That man can see through walls and has super hearing! I turned around to face the music.

"Boys, if you keep this up I will start giving away presents and I will send Santa an e-mail telling him what you guys are doing. So get your bohunkeses back into the living room or to your rooms. I don’t care which but you aren’t allowed in the den right now."

I caught Dad putting together presents last Christmas Eve so I knew he was Santa but he threatened me with no presents for 2 years if I told my brothers and sister that he was Santa. I know some of his threats he doesn’t mean but this one wasnt a threat, it was a fact! 

So we went to John's room and sat talking about our presents. One more week! I’m not sure if I can make it!!
Some rooms were empty of souls. They held apparatus, desks and chairs, straps. Organized neatly and forgotten this was where monsters were born. In those rooms, those forgotten rooms, the men and women of the crisp uniforms slated their lust on one another gutting their appetites salaciously. They gave no care to vow or matrimony worshipping their flesh on the altar of their uniforms. Bent lines and grinning death’s heads, blood and silver shining brightly on the horizon of arm bands and lapels. Superiors turned a blind eye to these diversions.

Outside, passing these pores, down the flanks and near the edge of the building’s furthest corner two soldiers hovered over their cigarettes. Smoke hung like great thoughts of suicide.

“I hear rumors,” one soldier said to the other. “Some are saying you have a whore locked away for your personal use.”

The other pulled a long glowing drag from his cigarette. Smoke tumbled from his nose and he breathed out fumes from casually pursed lips.

“What of it?” he asked dismissively not looking at the other. “These are rumors. So what?” he said with a shrug.

The other leaned in close. “You know it is against the law to bed these filthy animals! You know a child produced this way would only be partially human! Can you imagine?”

He pulled again on his cigarette, heard paper crumble into smoke under his inhalation.
Lady Gaga has appropriated many many things in her music career (the most controversial of which I won't get into because that's otro veinte pesos). One of the most striking is her appropriation of filmic techniques and the visual aesthetics of different filmmakers, including David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, and Quentin Tarantino.

This appropriation can either be interpreted as cheating ("She's just stealing from other people!") or as refreshing ("Yes!"). I, for one, am delighted to see a recording artist who relishes and takes part in the construction of her own music videos.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is, Lady Gaga for SGA President. I'll leave you guys with this:
In order to figure out the market and where you should set the price there is the basic supply and demand graph. (Red is supply, blue is demand)

This makes sense if there is more of an item, people will want/need less, so the price will have to go down to so people will again be enticed to buy and than the supply will go down creating a demand so what follows is the price going up.

While there is many other flaws I will focus on the idea of Demand.

What you may not have realized is that the idea of demand gets down to the social-psychology and the very nature of man. --or maybe you did think of that--

Demand is: how much of a specific commodity can be sold in a definite market in a fixed period of time. Generally this is quanitified

In order to measure demand
A) the commodity in question needs to exist
B) the commodity needs to be in play in that market for that fixed period of time.

Often the idea of demand is paired with something like food, surely food is the oldest commodity and is present in every culture and market on the planet. BUT everyone values food differently and it is only partially paired with our biological need to eat. Crazy?

From my experience (maybe not yours) I have met picky eaters, I have met healthy eaters, I have met meat eaters, and vegetarians, and those who like mexican and german and italian and ---you get the idea. Our demand for food is not just our body telling us to eat, its our "sense of self" telling us WHAT to eat. Yes, even our demand for food (at least in the modernized countries) is simply a product of our socialization and how we percieve reality. Demand has little relation to supply except for percieved scarcity and also a social constructed desire for that commodity.
I am going to share with you something that I experienced this summer that made me realize that life isn't short, it's just delicate.

When I got home from school for the summer this year I only had a few days to relax before I started a job that my brother was gracious enough to bestow upon me. The position was as a safety representative/site supervisor for a general contractor that was renovating an existing structure into a Bed Bath & Beyond. The title was a bit of a glorification as my knowledge of construction is limited. However, I caught on quickly enough to hold onto the job that nepotism acquired for me.

The first thing I learned was that the hours for this position are long. I was waking up at 5:45 am to get to work for 7 (It was a bit of a shlep to get there) and usually working till about 4:30 or 5, sometimes I'd be there until 6 pm. The kicker is that much of this industry employs a "hurry up and wait" strategy so much of this time was spent...well, waiting. Other times I was so busy I wished that there were 4 of me to get everything done that I needed to. Regardless of the type of day I had I was always ready for bed when I got home.
Upon entering the actual classrooms, we are confronted by an array of computer work stations, each one with 3 or 4 computers on it.  They assign all 3rd and 4th block students a computer in each station, and they have to work together to complete their assignment.  Again, I'll go into blocks shortly.  Next to this, is a small theater where they show movies and such to students, and also give lectures.  While it is nice to have it there, in their current location, it looks more like a temporary set up.  I assume this will change in the near future.  After the theater, there is a long hallway that is filled with past works they have done, including story boards, screen shots, character designs, etc.  At the end of the hallway is the 1st and 2nd block classroom, where each student is assigned a computer, which all face a screen at the front of the class.  This lets them see what the teacher is doing, so they can copy it on their own computer.  All of the computers in this school are PCs, and while they recognize that both Macs and workstations are prevalent in the industry, they find it is more affordable and standardized to just use PCs in the classroom.  They will even help a student build a PC, if they want one in their home.
Next door to this, is the mocap studio, which doubles as a green screen.  Here, they have a full sized green screen room, where half the room is a green screen, complete with props and computers and monitors.  They also have a series of mocap cameras in the room, about 20 I believe, to track movements of anyone wearing the mocap suit.  This is the same mocap system that was used in Monster House and Polar Express.
Other than these main areas, they also have a small reference storage area, full of varous reference materials, props and toys all over the place, offices for faculty and staff, a small sound room, and a meeting room I could not see, cause there was a meeting in it at the time.
Now, the entire school lasts for only 1 year for each student (assuming they don't fail).  Each year is split into 4 blocks, which are 3 months apiece.  A student is assigned wither night or day classes, which stays that way for the entire year.  Meaning the faculty have to change which times they teach classes every 3 months to accommodate the new recruits.  In the first block, you are bombarded with information, most of which is 3D modeling.
I like to think of myself as a creative individual, though at times I become frustrated with one or more of my endeavors. I find myself to be quite capable as a writer, instrumentalist, poet and you name what else, but drawing anything with a direct intent has always been something that eludes me.

My typical art, originally conceived of as a method to stay awake in history class in high school, manifests itself in the form of a variety of swirls, reflective spheres and curved and jagged triangles, such as this:

While at dinner some point last semester, I was diagramming a ludicrous plan to place magnifying glasses into orbit which would focus the sun onto an equatorial ring of solar panels that would power the entire world. I was struck by the resemblance of the positioning of the lenses to eyes which inspired me to finish the sketch off of a man made entirely of planets. Despite the fact I probably have lost the napkin, I do have this sketch I drew while in the calculus class I was taking that semester:
It really was just a bag of bones on the catwalk. Young bones. Good looking bones. But bones nonetheless. Living skeletons strutting their stuff in the name of fashion.

Why is it that fashion designers use shapeless, skinny women to show off their wares. They were there in Paris Fashion Week, last week and there they will be in all the other fashion weeks in Europe, and I have no doubt it is the same in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto and anywhere else where expensive women’s designer clothes go on show.

Clothes for the rich are not, apparently, made for normal women. Women who are woman shaped, with waistlines, boobs, legs. Women like you. Not living skeletons who live on crackers and lettuce leaves.

I don’t actually know any women who look like that and, frankly, if I did I would be tempted to stuff a few good burgers into them along with several portions of fries. Ok, so its junk food but if you are that skinny you need something to bulk you out a bit.

More seriously, of course, is the fact that too many teenage girls on both sides of the Atlantic view these women as role models. They envy their status. They envy their earnings and they envy the glamour.

They don’t care about the cut-throat nature of modelling, or just how difficult it is to become a Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell or Cindy Crawford. They just see the glamour.

And if the way to a glamorous career is to be slim, so be it. And that is the trail they go down. Missing meals; an obsession with weight; starvation; even to the point of lying and cheating to conceal the fact they are not eating.  

Inevitably the result all too often is one of the slimming diseases that need medical intervention. Sadly, even that is sometimes too late and girls and young women die.

Die in the name of glamour, of being cool and slim.

Die because the fashion industry persists in showing women that are completely untypical of women who walk the streets, hold down jobs and bring up families.

It is time to celebrate real women – woman who are egg-timer shaped. Women with appetites. Women who are proud of who they are.

Which is not to say that being overweight is normal or cool either. It isn’t. We are talking about extremes here. Both are bad and both are potentially life threatening. 

I should know because I was somebody who was overweight because of giving up smoking. This week I am celebrating losing a total of 47 lbs to bring me to 210lbs – still overweight but I am getting there.

It is time to start a campaign for ordinary women. Maybe T-shirts or badges proclaiming “I am normal”. It is certainly time the fashion industry began showing normal women on the catwalk and maybe even making clothes that the girl in the street is likely to wear rather than the bizarre creations they sometimes come up with.

You must have seen them on TV.

Garments you would not be seen dead in – even at a fancy dress party. Certainly not clothes you would go to work in - not unless you want to make a name for yourself.

So let’s hope our young women find themselves new role models to admire. Women who have achieved things in life; in business; in sport and not on the catwalk.

Most of all it is time to relegate the bag of bones to the cupboard of history.

Which is where they belong.
I have become full of hated. As if I am 12 again. It us a terrible feeling. I want to be irresponsible and stupid. I want to hurt certain people. And I want to ruin lives. Including my own.

You were that needle that broke my god damn back. And all of the sorries in the world couldn't fix this. I have become so upset, that I want to insult you. And emotionally hurt you. But, that is not who I am. But, I am fighting myself to not just do it.

You have made me sick. You know who you are. And you may never see this.

I feel strongly enough to say that I might hate you. Fuck.
When I was a teenager I had a guilty secret I thought nobody knew about. It was hidden under the bed where I believed nobody would find it.

It was porn.

In those days porn was not something you came across every day. It had to be searched out. It had to be passed from friend to friend in brown paper, getting ever more dog eared as time went on. 

And when Lady Chatterley’s Lover was finally allowed to be sold uncensored in buttoned-down Britain the “interesting” pages were very much the worse for wear. It was an era when sex was not something most people talked about and porn was considered completely outrageous.

And to many people – free thinking ‘normal’ people - it still is outrageous.

In just a few decades society has moved from a position where family life was sacrosanct and children had to be protected from “adult” images and philosophy to an age where anything goes.

At one time the most squirm-making conversation a parent could have with a child was the classic birds’n’bees ordeal. Times have changed since those innocent days. Now, it is the internet porn conversation.

The former, although perhaps a lip-biting ordeal, was at least natural, even moving, passing on the golden question of sexuality to the next generation but the latter is depressing and there is no script because the kids know it all anyway – or think they do!

Because of the internet every home faces a tidal wave of porn whether they like it or not. For at least the past decade the default setting for porn has been ‘on’ and parents are expected to guard children from all manner of imagery.
First, let me thank you for your recent comment on my site as well as your support to my plight. Thank you, my brother. Now, I see you are from Leonville, La. The name of your town has nostalgia written all over my recollections. We used to play Leonville High. We, as in Sunset High basketball team. When everybody on their team was called 'Davis.' Lol. Those were the days, some 20+ years ago. I doubt you remember all that because you couldn't have been any older than 6 or so; before the merger/consolidation of all area high schools - to form Beau Chene High. You know there was a time, when I was about 10 years old or so, when I thought I could save the world. From what or who, I had no clue. All I knew was I was going to wrap a white sheet around my neck for a cape. I was going to gly away in my mind...fight the bad guys in my mind...then fly my 'Louise' away...just like the movies...in my mind. But, then I'd conclude that I needed a sidekick and since I had none, my plans were only an illusion. However, when i was a child, I thought like one. Now that I am a man, I'm called upon to act like one. See brother, black leaders don't exist anymore because the influential brothers and sisters are leaders and heroes only in their minds, wearing sheets for capes...looking for a sidekick or fall partner. No one wants to be the positive one, in singular form. I get that. I really do. It takes mean and women who possess moxie to lead. Men and women who are not slaves to corporate influences, or social intimidation. The world watches doers of deeds, not speakers of rhetoric. As a black race, we have placed ourselves back into the wilderness, and no one seems to even notice it. Too busy 'bling-blinging' until ignorant cataracts have blinded us all socially and morally. I wish, when I was free, that my mind would have been so loyal to reality as it is now. There's so much I could have done (would still love to do) to help out our people to see the reality of our existence. See, it only takes one to lead 'some' in the right direction....you, yes you can be that 'one.' You don't build a house by placing a roof up first. No. You build the foundation from the bottom up. You can start by educating the young. Teach them, and lead them into the realm of truth. And when they grow up, your voice and reasoning will be their beacon of justice and a new revolution that will break the chains of ignorance from our people once and for all. Our future rests in our children. Never doubt that! On that note, take care....I'm here for you.
I use to think about stuff like this all the time, mainly on trains. I love trains. Those noisy, crammed, and sometimes smelly Boston transit system commutes were my time to drown out everything around me and just reflect on me. Pin drops would echo within the Zen pools of my mind, it was so quiet in there. You can't daydream on car commutes; I wouldn't recommend it.

During those train rides, I use to think about what truly made me happy, about my relationships past and current, about my friendships, and about my future. I found peace reading and contemplating over the works of Locke, Whitman, and Marquez. And from those uncomfortable subway seats I watched and admired the bustling life of this metropolitan city and the interactions of its denizens. But despite years of watching and reflection, I could never answer that one haunting question: why can’t I be happy?
A couple of weeks ago, I had the good fortune to attend a unique and powerful gathering of senior HR executives and CEOs at a conference put together by CTPartners. 

The conference sought to create(and I thought very successfully) an open and candid discussion between business heads and the HR function to better understand why HR is not viewed as a true strategic player in most boardrooms and what can and should be done to change that picture.

It isn't like this subject has not been discussed many times before because obviously it has, but there were a number of things at this meeting that made it very different from others I have attended.
As my eyes were paralyzed to the sky I remember all the movements and formats waltzing through the air to the sounds of laughter and enjoyment.  It was a parade of unique forms drifting higher and higher as strings lengthened and feet marched.  They were human created birds surrendering to the wind and I was a child mesmerized by the fascination known as flight.  And it happened once a year in Franklin Park.  Many gathered and celebrated the art of flying kites.  I can remember sitting Indian style on freshly renewed spring grass trying to fit my tiny mouth around over bloated, slightly burned hot dogs and just watching all forms of kites taking formation in a sky that always seemed so bright on festival day.   My mother’s boyfriend, Curtis, bought me this huge Superman looking kite and they spent much time putting it together and getting the strings just right.  I didn’t quite grasp the concept of flying kites but I looked forward to seeing mine lifted as high as it could go.
Now don’t get me wrong, I am old and wise enough to realise that the temples and funeral service cant compete with the Disney Channel, but I had hoped some of our other excursions would have at least made the top 5 – we waded in the turquoise blue Indian ocean with 5 foot wild reef sharks for Christ sake, we watched as wild baboons shoved their big red assess into our faces, and we even drove (unwisely) down mountain passes in a knackered old Suzuki APV to find untouched, unspoiled and unpopulated beaches – drives so scary that even the blondest dumbest Aussie surfer wouldn’t dare traverse to catch the a ‘radical’ wave.
I found myself encouraging them to answer how I wanted them to answer, a top 5 that included spiritual, emotional and evangelical experiences, they seemed bemused at my suggestions.
So now as I sit here on my way back to 237 un-opened emails, 40c degree heat, the Olympics and a moody dog, I try to put some logic into why they answered in the way they did. I guess its obvious really, how can a lush tropical Forrest hugging an enormous volcanic calderas, compete with a boy who can change into monsters and aliens? Or how can a barren, wild and deserted golden sand beach beat the graphics, sound effects and monster splitting, head ripping, gut disembowelling joy of the latest PSP game? The truth is they can’t, well at least not to children brought up with international travel as a given, 3 dimensional aliens as role models, and food that tastes the same and is delivered within 30 seconds of ordering – anywhere in the world, it can’t.






So whilst I stood motionless during the avalanche of abuse pouring over me, I had time to wonder and contemplate her argument, gearing up for a repost equal to the verbal beating I had just taken. What could I say? Was she right? Had I been directly funding the imprisonment of minority religious leaders? was I responsible for the decline in the traditional Chinese family system? Had I somehow become a key player in China’s destruction of the worlds sensitive eco system?


I played with responding using the Norman Tebbit philosophy that I was just “Getting on my Bike” and finding work to support my family, or even the Nazi war crimes excuse that “I was just following orders”. None of these seemed appropriate or relevant, I had left a UK job to come to China, and I was for all intense purposes the boss with no one giving me direct instructions. So I mustered all of my intellect, my years of social grooming, the decades of experience and the extremes of my vocabulary to utter a single word – “Bollocks”.
Last Friday, the drama department at my school went on a field trip to the University of Arizona in Tucson to tour their theatre department and watch their production of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." The drama teacher asked the faculty if anyone could chaperon. I said I'd do it if my daughter could come along, which she was fine with. So Sofia took a day off of school and we went to Tucson for a little Shakespeare. Since Sofia enjoys drama, I thought it would be a great experience. We had a good time.
You know it takes very little to qualify as being a 'nice guy' these days.

You pretty much have to just not be a complete prick, and already you're higher up the respectability ladder than many in this cynical era.
If you, humble reader, happen not to be from England and are wondering what it's like, then allow me to attempt a description.

First of all, remove the idea that all English people are positively reserved, yet jovial and kind-hearted people. That cliche died almost a century ago.

No, instead imagine a vast expanse of grey concrete and stained, decaying brickwork; its gloomy litter-strewn pavements populated by silent introverts studiously avoiding eye contact, for fear of verbal/physical confrontation or possibly a suicide bombing.
In fact the general city atmosphere is now one of island-like isolation. People are becoming ruder, less civil even to those close to them, and some base values of politeness and chivalry have been all but forgotten. 'What's
he/she after?' and 'What's in it for me?' are two of the most self-posed questions.

But hey I should be thankful, because it certainly helps increase the impact that a simple good deed or act of kindness has on those around you. Having the words 'please' and 'thank you' garner a surprised reaction is a strange thing to observe, but an altogether pleasant one at least.
You've heard the expression "I've had it up to here (hand parallel to the earth while levitating your hand in front of yer brow)"  It is like we are a vessel that holds negativity, and when there is too much, we overfill and...then... we just plain lose ourselves.   But when positive hits us, the vessel drains.  When I see the level lower, I know that sometime ahead, negative will inevitably be on a future path.  But why let that inevitability lessen the positive?  Savour the great moments, and be prepared to not give the full value of what future negative intends for you.

So how do you prepare for a meeting 30 yrs in the making????

I have thought about what I would say to my father if I ever saw him again at least 100 times. Every time it was something different. When I was 13yrs old I would have said "Who the fuck are you?" At 23yrs old I would have said "You have a lot of nerve to show your face".. Today at 33yrs old I said nothing. I simply reached out my hand, pulled him towards me and gave him a hug. It seems that over the years I have had time to grow up and understand that holding in bad blood and half the story would only hurt me. I didnt ask what happen between my mom and him. At this point it does not matter. A few months ago my brother disowned me and I am not sure why but what I learned from that was that to have been given a second chance at a relationship with him would have been priceless. It has yet to happen but tonight I was faced with an opportunity to give someone a second chance. I lost a brother but gained a dad and now 2 sisters. We exchanged info and hours of stories. I even got him to leave my mom a voice mail saying hello and wishing her well. I guess he is giving second chances too. 

Everybody, this is my dad Mr. Iglesias aka "The Mariachi" and yes he still sings.
Well here I go again rambling.
 
The answers to my questions, the answers that only I can find are found in no other than me. They are deep and imbedded in my soul that are not easily exposed. Without me searching for these answers we are left to pounder where what and why. So here I sit in wrighting this to dwell in the depth and find myself. I look in every crevous and hole to no avail and realize the answers are not to be revealed. Instead the answers will become clear as life is lived and only if I look forward to the path of my father and live as if I have lived my life forever.
Not everyone will encounter it, and not every soul will feel it as strongly as another soul might, but there is a period of trial that in it's depth can almost strangle us. Mother Teresa felt it acutely like a sense of abandonment from God. And others have felt it as a confusion and a deep sense of unknowing. Job encountered it when he lost everything, absolutely everything and sat naked in the ashes with his wife telling him to "Curse God and die!".

I have known some of it's sting when lonely and down I have felt like heaven is closed and my prayers are no longer heard. This is the long dark night of the soul. We are not taught of it in Sunday school where all the answers to the questions are "Jesus". We don't talk much of it in bible school where the times are good, and the friends are near. God is just around the corner and we are creeping closer all the time. But now out in the world we find it. It isolates, and hauls us off into the places where we would have never thought that we would go.
I grew up on a farm outside Cazenovia, NY and attended Harvard College on an ROTC scholarship. I served on active duty in the Marine Corps from 1989 to 1993, including deployment with the 2d Marine Division to Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. After leaving active duty, I worked as a mortgage banker and policy analyst/author before returning to Harvard for my Masters degree in teaching. I have taught history and coached track and cross country at Cazenovia high school since 1996. I've been in the Marine Corps Reserve since leaving active duty and have served with the 4th Civil Affairs Group and 8th Tank Battalion in addition to completing the Marine Corps' Reserve Command and Staff Seminar and Reserve Component National Security Course at National Defense University. My current assignment as a Marine Historian allows me to combine my love of the Corps with my enthusiasm for teaching and history. I hope this site will help me to share my experiences and perspectives with my students and others.
Greetings. 
I do realize that it's been some time. I apologize for the irregularity in my posting, but I have again been somewhat busy in my studies. Now it's Christmas time again! Consequently, I felt the necessity for a holiday update on my life. 
Short version: It's been fine.
Alternate version: School's been good. I've really been enjoying Greek and Biblical Interpretation. My other classes have been fine if not amazing. Next semester I'm required to start my internship. I'm not exactly sure where I'm doing that yet. I'm contemplating (due to the recommendation of some of those over me) either Palm Avenue Baptist Church (which I've been to once) or The Well (which I've never been to.) I'd appreciate your prayers regarding both the reduction of my anxiety and for clarification regarding God's will.
Just three months from today, while much of the United States is trapped amidst a bleak and gray winter, a bright and warm moment will bring the World together as one to celebrate the passing of one age into an entirely new one. Regardless of whom they've supported in the past, or the cumbersome worries they may carry into the future, the World will unite and look beyond what we've known these past few years. Partisan politics will be forgotten (if just for a brief time) and the World will finally turn the page to move ahead with hope and optimism. Men will weep. Women will cheer. Songs will be sung. Bibles will be sworn upon. Children will be forced to pretend they care.

January 20, 2009. My 30th birthday. It also happens to be Inauguration Day. Either way, seems like it's worth celebrating.

Before all that happens, I feel as though there are still a great many things I should do, experience, and accomplish before I exit my twenties. Moreover, I'm interested in your thoughts and advice as to what you might recommend I do within the next 90 days. They can be big things or little things, as long as they are achievable things (its doubtful that I can win an Olympic medal between now and January).
If you're reading this, you're no doubt asking yourself, "Why did this have to happen?"  The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time.  The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn't enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken.  Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless… especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head.  Exactly what is therapeutic about that I'm not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy.  Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all.  We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers.  Remember? One of these was "no taxation without representation".  I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood.  These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a "crackpot", traitor and worse.
You know life is life you can’t really chose where it takes you, god has a reason for everything that is the way I look at it. Sure you going to lose those you think you love and those you do, but if it wasn’t meant to be, there is nothing you can do but love, live and go on about your life. Sometime you get to the point when you have to just stop and think about all the positive things that have happened to you and stop thinking about the things in your life that you have fucked up, or things that have happened to you. My life has taken many many turn's some for the good some for the bad, but I am who I am from my past. I have many people that have been there for me throw everything and some that are just there to support me when I need someone to talk to, I am very thankful for those people and you know who you are. But I have to thank my dad for most of it, we have had are times like may may kids but he has never giving up on me even sometimes when he wanted to just drop kick me in the ass for some of the stupid shit I have done, but if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be the man I am today, if you know who i am u would know that I would do just about anything for those I care about. Some people abuse that to there advantage, but that’s there own fault. I want to thank everyone that has been there for me throw these ruff times and would do anything for you. But i am going to just say if your no longer in my life there is a reason why and you can just fuckin get over it!
I nearly lost last yesterdays post! Luckily the draft was complete. After seeing Laura had commented on Jasons post, I turned in for the night.I had a long sleep. I would like to have more time before class but i should be fine. I did lose the workI had started on my presentation, and I forgot about my chemistry quiz.

Mmm breakfast.. I just lost connectivity. Gessi posted two new models for me to see.
I got some balance transfer cheques!
I missed class and have decided to stay home to work on my presentation. Things that I would also like to do: work on my composition, work on my visual art, work on my guitar. I should reward my self with such behaviour. How much work is resonable to have accomplished before setting out to reward myself? I musn't over reward.

Finish a section, play a track draw a picture, get back to work?
On to next weeks seminar presentation. I'm tempted to work on my new composition. I should pick up something to eat.
Nice, I found the article Dr. Claxton-Oldfield recommended.
Brr, it's kinda cold.
I'm sure you'd suck the nipples off her if you could. Dude! She's a cartoon!
More attractive than a villain, not quite a hero.
Jake did an excellent job cleaning the place.
PB and J is devoured. I'd love to crash right into my bed, but it needs to be made. Yoga class was awesome today. Ah, my bed is made :) Ahh... Orange juice. I should like to eat something more, but what? My internet connection is not being very co-operative. I suppose I should prepare a meal of brown rice and frozen vegetables. I'm craving something sweet.
A bit of chicken noodle rice onits way. I've eaten all of my crackers. I think I'll throw some eggs into the mix.
Channel your feelings into your work
I got my bag paked, washed-up, and I'm ready to head in for the night.
I'd like to feel good about what I've accomplished this weekend. A part of feels as though this pulled muscle in my back is punishment for something I did wrong. The amount of work I got done in RDA and Social Psych doesn't help any. Dominique would count it towards Catholic guilt. Could it be so ingrained?
I'm practicaly caught up on my housework. I wish I had more time to play guitar. Pat Metheny is really good.
With any luck, I'll be up early and rested tomorrow morning with ample time to get some studying done before class. After class I'll finish up my lab and I might spend some time at the gym. On my way home I'll pick up some groceries, have supper when I get here, then pick away at the rest of RDA. I might squeeze an RDA session in while I'm on campas. One day I got through three chapters while I was working in the student center.
I stood, suspended on gossamer words,
Trapped in sound and light they span out, simple
With gently placed phrasings they could not but call
And in these words, and motions, spinning truth
A gentler rhythm, a kinder rhyme breathes
Out, and in the audience, all air,
Stilled, and charged, and frozen in it’s glory,
As upon a platform below our feet
But above our minds, in incandescence
Framed in motions, truly daring in heart
and soulful intent, we are all acting
They seem to say, declaring it to us all,
Ah, but oh, I hear us all exhaling
What beauty in this act, there is, trailing.
The black rock on the left is obsidian I found at a hunting cabin we go to once or twice a year. Obsidian itself I find to be interesting, but in this case, it's not just the fact it's obsidian that makes it unique. If you look closely, you can see concentric rings on the forward face. This is caused to glass by a hard impact, for example if you've ever seen glass that has been shot with a BB gun. Second to that, this obsidian was found in what had previously been american indian territory very far from any volcanic areas. While it's possible it arrived there in another manner, I find it most likely that it had been traded for from a far away place by a group of indians and was discarded in the process of flint-mapping an arrow. Besides this glass being around, there are also grinding holes in many rocks, guaranteeing the presence of indians in the past.

The rock to the right of the obsidian is black and what I see as orange in a striated pattern and was found in a riverbed. The patterning shows significantly better when wet. Besides liking the coloration of this stone, I am struck by its similarity to the flesh of fish.

The next two stones were found at a beach. The one on the left appears to be made of a conglomeration of soft and hard stones and this is demonstrated by the way the stone has worn, leaving protruding bands of the harder yellow stone. The next one appears to be sediment condensed into stone, including shells which cause the white, slightly pearlescent layers. The stone that is not like shell has a green tinge, which suggests it originated from a fairly good depth of populated water.
So once again I have ended a shift at the place i work. It was less than fun and really made my head hurt.
Now to my issues. I have found that people suck. I say have a good day and the reply is pretty much nothing. What causes people to be so rude? I am just some guy working at a store trying to make some sort of liveing. So the journey begins. I have started fresh upon this page. My ideas that shall flow upon here for all to see. This is the beginning of my thoughts lets see what dark ally we get lost in. For you have started a hike along the narrow path which is my inner most ideals. Lets see how far my mind can take us.
The gaming world is a fucking flaming piece of shit. I'm honestly considering trading in my 360.

When I started playing PC FPS games in 1997 it was all about community, respect, friends and fun. I could hop on a server knowing that I was going to have fun, say "good game", "nice nade", "great shot" and in return have the same done back to me.

Now with the release of console games with access to the internet the fanbase of gaming has been spread throughout a wide community of thickheaded kids. Every time I get into a game of Modern Warfare 2 I am greeted in the lobby by hoards of latin-accented shit talkers screaming and not letting anyone get a word in edgewise. There's no longer any room for logic left in the game. Kids attracted to games like Halo 3 and Cod: World at War have completely overrun us. The immaturity level is astounding. I was 7 when I started playing online and I still had more maturity than these fucking assholes.

Honestly, if you're going to talk shit and act like you're better than me, then prove it. Stop being a pub scrub and get your ass into a private game and scrim or 1v1 me. The gaming world is obsolescent.
So if yall dont know i finnaly met somebody who completes me. her name is kendra willingham.just talking on myspace i didnt even imagine anything would happen like this.but so far everything is amazing.i love everything i mean everything about this girl.from her smile,her personality,her kisses and her beautiful looks.theres never a dull moment with this girl and i havent lost a single bit of interest in her every since i first saw her on myspace.you know i thought i loved someone before and you probably know who you are but nothing compares to the way i feel about kendra.its the best feeling in the world knowing no matter what i have done or what kind of day i am having i can always talk to her and every emotion im feeling goes away as soon as my phone lights up and im sure she can say the same.some might call it fate or a coincidence i just so happen to run across her profile while im doing my AIT down here in goodfellow afb but i KNOW it was meant to happen especially how everything just came together like it did.im going to let people talk and run their mouths because of our apparent differences but i know as well as she does im not going anywhere and either is she.call it puppy love,call it fatal attraction,hell call it whatever you want but i know its true love and i would not change a thing and i have no regrets so far. im very happy and excited to see really how far we go. but thats all i got to say. i love you kendra
This Saturday, February 13th from 11-5PM is the first LA Street Food Fest. I will be setting up the Mr Toast booth This is going to be a crazy cool show with 30 food trucks and 30 designer vendors (including our friends Spicy Brown). It is $5 to get in and they are expecting a crowd! It is near downtown at the Center Studios.
Memorial Day. We are here today to remember. To give thanks. To pay tribute. We do this because it is the right thing to do. Our fallen heroes are worthy of our time, our attention, our honor. We also do this to support and comfort the families and friends of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We hope to remind them that their loss has paid the mortgage on freedoms we all cherish. Finally, we do this to demonstrate our values as a people; that courage is honorable, that service is essential, that sacrifice will be sanctified. In doing so, we shape the next generation of young Americans.
This is how the weekend started.  I threw on my blue plaid shirt with the green undershirt, the one that makes my chest and arms look bigger than they are.  Then people came over to our place, and we explored the attic space I'd been too scared to look in since we moved in.  No ghosts.  We took some video and ran voice recorders, hoping to pick up some kind of EVP from our apartment ghost(s?).  So far, nothing doing.  Then we took a midnight (train to Georgia...woo woo!) trip to another friend's house.  She wasn't expecting us, and we rolled out the welcome banner we'd made while she poured us some wine.  I drank too much and got kind of silly.  It was nice to visit.

Saturday, Robb and I visited the library in town.  I got some more CDs, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the daffodils (my favorite flower because the portend Spring) poking through the mud next to the walk.

[DSCF0682]

We hung around the apartment, mostly.  It was nice having the boy home for a change, since the ski season is officially over.  So we basked in the homey Saturdayness of the morning and afternoon, and then we headed off.  We stopped to meet friends in Manhattan (not NY) where one of them was working.  Mutual harassment ensued.  Then we went back to her place and met her new friend:
They say Jesus was a good man and an excellent role model for us as modern day society but, as you will see below, I have strong reasons to dispute this. 


Assuming that Jesus even existed at all, and going on what I have read about him, I can only conclude that, while he may have had some goodness about him, he was little more than one of many mentally unstable, intimidatory, self-conflicting and self-serving preachers who roamed the hot deserts of bronze aged Palestine and perhaps we should consign his memory to the history books along with Zeus and Horus upon whom, many suspect, he himself was based.


I have decided to be fair though and will respectfully give Jesus his due to start off with. Here are some examples of the few praiseworthy aspects of his work on earth.
have you ever wondered why/some people get high/look up into the sky/pondering the exact day and moment at which they will die/well give it a try/you might break down and cry/realize you’re living a lie/realizing life does suck/and how many people out there don’t give a fuck/well some of us run out of luck/lay in on your death bed feel in stuck/lookin into the light/hooked up on life support/tryin to make it through the night/the rich people they got it made/movie stars gettin laid/while some are on the streets just tryin to get paid/well that’s all I got to say/that’s it for today/take it as it is or just walk away
Texas has a lot of history behind her, so far as states go. Her icons like Texas rangers, the Alamo and oil lust are known about throughout the world. We Americans have set the world on fire because Texas oil men wanted to invade Iraq.

Texas is an odd state. Full of natural beauty and the romance of the Old West, led by a crazy Christian cult that cares more for the rights of the rich than life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of the poor costarring horses and bovines. I really enjoyed the place when I was in El Paso and San Antonio and still miss to this day watching storms roll across the desert mountains off in the distance as the desert sun beat down upon me.
Texans see themselves as independent from the rest of the United States, they dwell in a frontier state between Mexico and the US in their collective imagination. A romantic idea to be sure; a respite from the modern world.

The Texas board of education made the headlines today for embracing Christian philosophy while playing down science and set back schooling standards intellectually by about 100 years. Kinda like Kansas did but with more manure.
It always gives me pause and makes me wonder why Christians need to try so hard to push their teachings down everyone's throat through social programing. If their message had true meaning and power in the first place then they wouldn't need to strive so hard to make everyone believe it too. Is their faith so small? Or does this lack of real meaning and virtue reflect their true inner state?
Who's to say?
I do not pretend to know the answer as to why some folk prefer the darkness to the light.
So I haven't been eating or sleeping much lately, since my anxiety and my depression been bad I just haven't been able to do those two things and I'm worried because people told me I look much more pale and skinnier, which you would think me being sober would do the complete opposite, I know things will get better it's just hard doing it by myself no matter how many times people say other wise I'm basically alone with my extreme problems, it's cool though because in some weird way I know I deserve to feel this way.

It sucks big time because I'm a little lonely but it's cool I can deal with it I just need to keep school a top priority So I can start my new life.

The only real thing keeping me here would be my goals because they are keeping me positive. Also I find it hard not to result to old ways since I'm so depressed but I have been clean and sober which is good I just look at this time as Gods way to show me that I need alternative methods of being happy with me.. I know I'll be ok but I just need people rooting for me..... Also in the pic below it's a new sleep tracker app I got and lol last night was the most I had in forever lol I will post more of these because they are mad interesting but hey take a look!!
I keep a pretty good handle on the right wing nutters, but I'd never heard of S.E. Cupp before today when she was talking about Tiger Woods and plugging her upcoming book Losing Our Religion (which is predictably about how the left wing supposedly hates Christianity).

SE was talking to the Hannity stand-in and expressing her outrage that because Tiger didn't come out and say he was a loser, he was a loser. In a tie-in to her book, she pivoted on Tiger's comment about his previous and newfound dedication to Buddhism. Of course, that was a "direct attack" on Brit Hume who had -a while back- commented that Tiger come to Jesus and get some real redemption and ethics.

And then SE was outraged. "Buddhism, whatever," she railed, "Buddhism considers adultery a sin too." She continued: "He's obviously out of touch with whatever his god is."


Why do some people look down on Christianity, S.E.? Because of Christian(-esque people) like you. Ignorant, ignorant people like you who do not think any other belief is worthy of fifteen minutes of your time to learn the basics of the phraseology of their system, let alone the belief structure.

To clarify: Buddhism does not have a creator god, nor do they believe in the self-deprecating Christian construction of sin, original or otherwise.

But because she is informed on only one form and concept of religion, she can't speak in any other terms, even for 5 minutes. How'd she write a book about the subject? Jesus!

Here's an analogy: Many Europeans think Americans are asses because they expect the world to speak English and most won't take the 5 minutes to learn "please," "thank you," and "Do you speak English?" They just talk louder. And that's what you're doing, S.E. Not smarter - or even smart - just louder.

If you want respect from others, whether other religions or while traveling abroad, begin by showing some. I believe some would call that "being Christian."


UPDATE: To clarify, S.E. Cupp is a self-proclaimed atheist. But a bad one. Check the comments for my full opinion.
Now, you'd think the sight of someone in this condition, slumped over on a chair being held up by two people, among others in a waiting room who had only seemingly incurred superficial injuries would be enough to merit immediate medical attention. However, this was not the case. The triage nurse refused to allow her to skip anyone in line. After a half hour in the waiting room it was clear that my mom was getting worse. My dad is terrible in these situations. He saw that I was worried and like a good dad was trying to quell my concerns with lighthearted conversation but I was less interested in that and more interested with what status my mom might be in in another half hour. With that, I stood up and walked directly through the big swinging doors with large signs saying "No Entrance", "Hospital Staff Only", and other such signs. I found a Doctor and informed her that there is a lady, my mother, in triage who has not been seen and (in so many words) whose condition resembles symptoms of a heart attack. The Doctor came back with me immediately to see her. She (the Dr.) told the triage nurse to let her register right away, and when that was said the other people in the waiting room...this was after an hour of apathy...verbalized that my mom, who at this point could no longer move of her own volition, could go in front of them. With no beds left in the hospital, this only helped things marginally. In the triage nurses office there was a bed that my mom was able to lie down on. As the triage nurse took her vitals, she smirked an "I told you so smirk" and said "Her vitals all seem normal." As if to say "FUCK YOU" to this triage nurse my mom immediately began to vomit a bright green fluid. We had to turn her on her side because she wasn't able to move and we worried that she might choke. Seconds later, another nurse came rushing in to take control and my dad and I were kicked out of the room. The vomiting continued for about 30 more minutes. We were called in once more about an hour later to help move her onto a bed that had become available and we wheeled her into one of the curtained off areas where the admitted patients wait to be diagnosed. Sometime between then and when the nurse in charge came she shat her pants.

At this point, I was holding my moms hand beside the bed. I could feel it shaking in my hands but slowly the shaking subsided and my mom drifted off to sleep for about another hour (this was after nurses cleaned off the accidental defecation). If we got to the hospital at 6 pm, it was now 11 pm.
I am going to vote on November 4. I never miss an opportunity to cast a ballot. Ever.

I just want to make a quick comment on the state of slander in the Presidential race. I just can't imagine how far people are willing to go to make a demon of someone. If you don't want to vote for a particular candidate -- fine, but, the fact you aren't voting for that person does not make them a devil, the anti-christ, the precursor to the anti-christ, a marxist, a pal of terrorists, etc. on and on.
Sickening to me.
These are two brilliant, well-qualified men who are running for President. They have both distinguished themselves. They have different views of how to move the country forward. Discuss that. Stay on point. Then, go vote. The one who gets the most votes wins -- and then becomes our President like it or not.
Have you ever been in a situation that was bad for you but at the same time you could not leave? I was in that situation for almost five years. The good news is though, i got out of my situation and can now tell the world about what it was, how i got out of it, and where I am headed. 




  As this myspace shows, i was in a relationship for almost five (5) years with my now ex-girlfriend. We broke up because the love died, the relationship failed to make both of us happy, and we were left wondering with whom we were to be with in the distant future. So she left me, at first it was hard for me to accept. After being with someone for almost five years, all off a sudden its taken away from you. You begin to realize in the beginning of a long term relationship that when it ends it feels like a drug. You feel like you need THAT PERSON just to be happier. I was faced with something I had no control of. It was not like I could go buy her off the streets...no....it was over and that was it. I began to morn my loss. Until my friends and family began to morn because they felt like they lost me!!!! As soon as I realized what I was doing to them and myself I realized that I need to pull through so they could pull through. I IMMEDIATELY snapped out of mourning, and all my life energy went into being there for everyone who "couldnt do it without me" so I choose to choose life for myself first, life for them second. 


  In choosing life I realized life without her was not going to just happen I had to do some of the work. Even if that meant getting out with my friends (and making new ones if you know what I mean ;-)...) Before I started going out solely to meet someone new. We had a first (and last) date to start things off right. It didnt feel right though, you see....we started over so it was supposed to seem (and feel) like we never knew each other. But she was too comfortable around me, and made it seem like we were far from over. I was left at the end of our date thinking "so where did we end?? How are we supposed to do this??" It did not feel like we ended however my heart knew and felt otherwise. I had already done my mourning so I got over it in a sense. Our date did not make it help for this respect it just made it worse. So I decided I was done playing her games. I was not going to listen to her anymore. I was and am going to live my life the way I want to. Although I now hate her for those years wasted. There was some love there too that made it all worthwhile. Im going to remember this life lesson and use it for when I find someone else. Nothing in the world is more powerful then that. 


  The end of a long term relationship is one of the hardest things to let go of if its not good for your well-being. The lessons learned from this though will help me for when god decides to give me a girlfriend (or maybe a wife.) We all have the ability to control our destiny, sometimes though fate has the final say with or without its sense of irony.
I'm disappointed that I don't have this game on tape. Why you ask? Not because of the come from behind victory for the third week in a row (as nice as it would be to watch in the off-season), instead because of the the brain freeze by those at NBC Chicago.
I'm not the only one who saw this, both my sister and my old man sent me text messages from a-far, crying for an answer as to what was going on (in which I had no idea).
For those who don't know or are unaware, NBC Chicago cut out of the Irish victory on Saturday at a very unoportune time. As overtime began NBC got the ball rolling fine but right when Jimmy Clausen was set to take the first snap of the extra period, a message came across that NBC was joining their previously scheduled show already in progress.
Enter roughly two minutes of "Access Hollywood".
I've been working on some new material. " When you're blind aren't your other senses supposed to kick in? like Humor? Hey! I can't fully commit to a relationship- where's my parking spot? I don't know what I'm going off about- Bitter? just a bit. I've been driving through blizzards to perform for twenty years and I'm headlining at Bunker's sports bar Saturday. Yah- I see the obvious Hitler chunk- Bunker! He'll forever be connected to bunker's. Maybe if he'd hid in the Attic with the Franks he would have lived a little longer!
   What am I on about? I don't know. I just ate some porridge and am trying to drag myself to the gym. Good for me! It's Lent I'm not really Catholic I was raised Catholic but every-time one of my Alter boy buddies hung them selves I became a little less spiritual. I'm giving up junk food for lent. It doesn't seem right- Jesus gave up his life for us and I'm giving up Nibs and Junior Caramels. My Cross to bear.
   Well I'm watching the Olympics. We spend Millions on a cross country skier so they can finish 42. Alright- I'm not math guy but if GOLD is a hundred percent return on our investment where does 42 put our investment? Silver is 50% return Bronze 25- fourth 15 See where I'm going? You finish 42 that's the same as some schmuck calling up grandma and saying "hey I'm your long lost nephew! can you front me seven mill so I can travel the world for four years and party me ass off and then finish 42 in front of the family! If you're finishing 42 that's freakin idenity theft!
  Investing seven million so a cross country Biathlete can finish 42? listen that gun you have hanging around your neck- you can't hit a target twenty feet away! idea- spin the gun around and pull the trigger! Don't worry- you'll miss!
I'm OUT!
In many ways I've reached a point where I expect at least something of value to be given to me for free. I expect an eBook about your industry, I expect a small SEO suite of tools, I expect...
I see where Malcolm's distress is coming from - most of the video's on YouTube are pretty low-quality to say the least, there are numerous scam blogs that scrape others and are built solely for adsense - the free community publication sites such as suite101.com and on and on are crawling with subpar articles. I could go on. When you make the barriers to entrance easier more people flood the streets. In the case of Iran this is a great thing - in the case of quality novels perhaps not.
The one thing is for sure, whether or not it should happen won't have a huge effect on whether it will happen.
Just because something will look a bit different and requires more work doesn't mean its all that bad.

Companies need to be dynamic and constantly changing in attempt to adjust to the dynamic markets and constantly changing technology.
I recently saw a krafts cheese add on TV. The commercial talks about how great kraft's is and towards the end it say's "A country is only as good as it's cheese, and Ours (kraft's cheese) doesn't have holes in it." Now I know that a lot of people could care less what a craft's cheese add has to say towards anything.
But to me this really rings "stupid". I'm glad craft's thinks that America is this amazing country. Now of course, I do think that their are few things that actually make this country amazing. First off our education system. Very few places in this world give EVERYONE the opportunity to have an education. I do believe that it's American's who are growing more stupid everyday, because people could careless weather their children have an education or not. Another thing which makes our country amazing is the opportunities that some are given, most people have the opportunity to do things that in some countries would be impossible to do.
As we all know, Guangzhou is a large city, it’s very modern, nearly you can find everything what you want here, you can see the high buildings or you can live in the most luxurious house if you are rich enough. Even like this, there are many dreams you can't come true here.
       Some people prefer to live in a cozy little home rather than in a big mansion, its wonderful living in the village, from here you can embrace with the nature, have a good mood and smiling all the time, what's more, we find the inspiration better which it's important to our study and work. It's so noisy in the large city that we always feel annoyed.
       Beautiful village, beautiful mood.
ve been meaning to delve into the concept of "free" for some time, but I have been roused to ask a few questions about the issue after reading a recent article by Seth Godin boldly title "Malcolm is wrong" which was written in response to Malcolm Gladwell's article "Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?" which was a review of Chris Anderson's new book "Free: The Future of a Radical Price"
whew that was a bit of a circle...
While there are several great points each author has made I wanted to highlight a couple that I found interesting morsels to chew on.
Seth brings forth a great critique of a common analytical framework,
    "should we want free to be the future?"
    Who cares if we want it? It is. (emphasis mine)
Too often when people see change they ask, "should we." When discussing matter of whether something "should" or "should not" be, we have to realize that often the scenario will exist whether we want it too or not. We must adapt costantly, balance is only temporary. I'm not necessarily saying free is the future, I can't say that I am knowledgeable enough to say either way. I do, however, think that it will and is playing a major role in the economy today it will have devastating effects on those old, static, monolithic companies that refuse to change.
This today would be alright to have on main stream ads or billboards and even TV commercials because it's what WE have made socially acceptable. BUT more often than not if it were someone with a lot more clothes on heavier and maybe braces.

Because if two girls like this were kissing it'd be more unacceptable. 

Why is it that a woman can publicly have a relationship with another woman and also be interested in men and it is completely valid and truthful? 

While often times if it were two men kissing, or two straight men exploring their sexuality (like many girls do.)

They'd be considered gay.

So is it a double standard in terms of us allowing woman to 
explore sexually anything and we don't allow the same for men. 
Is it possible for people of every day too put aside the cock blockery bull shit we read in the magazines that say size double D tit's and 12 foot cock be what everyone should look for in a person?





I'm not quite sure if anyone can really just act upon what they want and essentially just DO as they please or who they please weather that mean a guy for one night plays pocket pool with another guy, or a girl play slap happy with her tongue and another girls Pikachu? We've created so many restrictions for ourselves to only play in this little circle that society says is okay too play. I've always believed true rebellion comes from an education and I think people need to begin to educate and talk about something like sexuality and letting it be more of some thing that everyone can explore.

I mean isn't that sort of an attepmt at trying to discorver who you are as a person? & since when was that such an awful thing.

Quite an odd thought to think about. The idea that everyone if not anyone might look at people weather it was a man or a woman "for who they are inside", instead of someone's sex. You hear about people who always say "I go for personality not looks" really it seems no one really does. How many people do you know that look at someone's personality before they look at social status, main stream idea of what's beautiful, or even the sex of a person.

Are we only built to not be sexaully attracted to people for who they really are?

As a collector and dealer, sometimes things happen that are pretty hard to believe. Over fifteen years ago, I purchased an amazing Superman Pep cereal advertising sign. As a cereal collector, this is one of those once in a lifetimes finds. I held on to the sign for a number of years but ended up selling it.

Now years later I was able to buy a second one of these signs. I am sure they made a few thousand of these back in 1947. They were put up in grocery stores and then ended up in the trash. But as with all things, a few were saved, and somehow I have had two end up in my possession. This is the reason I love collecting, you get to be a part of recovering a bit of the past and giving it new home.
Shiloh is the story of a girl that endures the Holocaust and struggles to rebuild her life once liberated. The Holocaust is one of those horrific moments in history, one that is simply too overwhelming to understand and filled with such evil and hate. It is difficult to comprehend the depravity that would allow such a thing to happen to one person let alone six million. What I find particularly puzzling is the aftermath. Whole families devastated and yet these people had the courage to pick up what was left of their lives and rebuild. Shiloh is the recognition of this rebuilding. The girl in the story suffers bitter abuse at the hands of her captors. Through the humiliation and wrenching pain the girl manages to endure and, upon liberation, begins to build her life from what was. The story of Shiloh is one that has been difficult to write thus a full novel is simply out of the question! After much deliberation I decicded blogging the story of Shiloh into episodes would be beneficial, would give this story its voice. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for visiting! --Tim
Something I’d always wondered about: Why do all of the members of the Addams family have names that are sinister in one way or another except Gomez? Dark associations of Morticia, Fester, Cousin Itt, Thing and Lurch’s names are obvious. Wednesday gets her name from the line in the “Monday’s Child” poem — “Wednesday’s child is full of woe” — and Pugsley’s seems like a play on pugnacious or something thereabouts. But why should Gomez get a fairly normal name? A surname for a first name is hardly sinister.


Something I did not know: the members of the Addams family did not initially have first names. Only when the original Charles Addams comics were adapted for the 1964 TV show did the characters need to refer to each other. Addams chose all the character names himself, except for that of the family patriarch. For that one, he was considering both Gomez and Repelli, the former if the character were to be played as Spanish and the latter if Italian. According to the Wikipedia page, Addams left the final decision up to the actor who first played Gomez, John Astin, who chose to play the character as Castilian. Which is too bad, really, because Repelli strikes me as a better name and a better match for the rest of the family members’ unpleasantly themed names. So that explains where the name came from, at least, but not where Gomez came from or whether Charles Addams thought it had negative associations.
Brief: Write a note about Exams.
Assigned by a scarecrow-esque human named Kirk Steaggles.

On a couple of a occassions as i walked into the exam hall i would sing 'this is the end, beautiful friend, the end' from the song 'The End' by the doors.
Kate Bush once sang the words, 'Heathcliff, it's me, it's Cathy, i've come home, i'm cold, let me in-a-your window'.
We can all sing (except Lilly Allen [1-0]) but do any of us really know what incident Kate Bush was alluding to? The answer is no. Until tonight!!

Heathcliff and Cathy had gone to Oceana. Heathcliff had got all dressed up in a striped shirt and smart trousers and school shoes and put on loads of aftershave. He had gelled his hair up at random points so it looked really good. He had drunk some bacardi breezers and so was feeling in a fine mood as opposed to the usual mood which led him to stand on the windy moors for hours on end. Not even he knew why. Some say he was waiting for a boat to arrive on the horizon, bringing his lost love home. But due to there being no water near the moors, this rumour seems to be unfounded and was probably started by one of his mates on the football team, 'for a laugh'.

Cathy was wearing fluorescent clothing because that was the theme of the night. She looked as radiant as a warm radiator on a summer's eve. Much alcohol later and after some terrific 'banter' from the lads, Heathcliff looks round onto the dancefloor and sees Cathy 'getting off' with someone else. He puts his drink down and storms over, considers punching the boy, but realises he's massive and decides against it. He calls Cathy a 'whore of babylon' and exits the club. He compiles some abusive texts and accidentally sends them to his workplace in his drunken state. He gets a taxi home, wishing later on that he'd got the bus cos it cost about ten quid to go a ridiculously short distance to his country estate....in the country.
My elder brother was an excellent student when he was at school and at home he was a good brother who took good care of me, thank you, my dear brother, I’d appreciate it.
       Time flies! my elder brother will be father soon, but what he said and what he did were clearly standing in my mind, there was one thing left a deep impression on me, I remembered my brother never used the school bag when he went to school, instead of it he preferred a plastic bag which was used for holding the clothes, it looked very nice and suited him even more......
       I imitated him today, I held my books with the plastic bag, and it could recycle for many times. Ha, I hope I am as excellent as my brother.
My life will take A different change for 2010. I plan on leaving AT&T for long term while I plan to join either the Air force or the Army. There I will study what I have always wanted to study which is computers. This year will be a year of study as I call it. It will be to learn what this new life holds in store for me. It will also be a year of getting closer to my family and friends while I am here in El Paso. It will be very hard to leave them. They know who they are. I thank them for everything they have done for me in times of good and it times of bad this year. One in particular (you know who you are) I am going to miss you the most. I plan to spend New Years Eve with her. I want her to be there when 2010 turns for the world. She is going to be my guest of honor for MY New Years 2010. My 24th birthday is the last one here in El Paso. I will enlist in February, probably be in basics by March Or April. May or June will bring my career training. By 2011 I’ll have a full military career. I’ll be far away from home to live and do what I want to do. I’ll be living my life the way I want to though, under no ones control like the way it was before.
After 3 or so weeks in the country, (many for the first time) they had gained the irritating view that they understood the complexities of this extremely complex and mysterious land, and that they could expel their beliefs with the confidence of a local inhabitant to all and sundry.

Firstly Beijing during the Olympics was probably as far from reality as you can get. A bit like landing in a working class street during the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations or the marriage of Charles and Diana, anyone visiting the UK for the first time during this period would have thought we were all kind, generous, happy, welcoming, and completely patriotic – if they had arrived several weeks earlier or later – maybe a different experience would have been had? Beijing was a bit like this – a street party for all comers to enjoy (as long as they were from the Chinese Middle classes or foreign), a party town, brightly decorated with flags, clean streets, painted signs and manicured green areas. People were on their best behaviours, tolerant of visitors and charitable to strangers, Christ even the taxi drivers wore shirts and ties.
Secondly, no one can really understand a place, its people, its culture, its history, and its philosophy in such a short period. Of course we all fall into this trap when on holiday – or at least I know I do!
..Stranger,

I’ve never felt stranger.

Tho’ this is not the last time, it feels like the first time, ever being so confused.

My mind is toxic, it has the cure for everyone else, yet ‘tis a curse on my own… state of mind, state of body, and place of being. There is something deep inside me -- a scab that needs peeling. Letting go of past grievances is something I’ve never been good at. But at last, my toxic mind is coming to its salvation. It has found, again, its freedom.

Stranger, 

Have you ever felt this strange?

Things seem to be speaking from every direction, signs fly from the heavens, and demons whisper from the floor.

That there is somebody, after everybody, that knows the feelings you have; that thinks the thoughts you have, and sees the world as you see -- inside the mind of another, yet so apart there is no knowing of truth? A heart can be broken, but can it be repaired? Heavens no. Hell no. Purgatory…. I am there, my mind is a desolate wonderland of cursed thoughts and abhorred desires to feel nothing. Yet, I want something. I wish for all to be good. NO, I wish for myself to be well and to be well unwell.

Stranger…
You have me wishing.
Down the hallway, murky with shadows was a heavy door that opened into the esophagus of a stairwell. Descending the stairs led to another heavy door. This led to the outside world.

Outside and across the walkway was the carefully knitted wire with its elegant teeth and its numbing electricity that hissed in the rain. Outside was the ashe grey sky and the snapping cold. Outside was the hard ground crusted over like a scab. Under foot the scab would crackle and crunch, old bitter bones and sun damaged glass. Very little grew here, only the twisted wees and the mold and the rotting fungi. These preferred the shadows, the corners, the folds of the building. Here in the folds as in the folds of a fat man moisture collected and the skin of the building chaffed. A small film of ooze caressed the inner most skin where soil and foundation met.

Walking beside the building with long lazy strides one passes several entrances all leading into a series of passageways or office spaces. Here, within the nerve center information was processed and evaluated. Papers were typed. Numbers were transcribed. Efficient men and women sifted through their work with precision and efficiency, neat and crisp like their uniforms.
You know this has been the most useful internet tool I’ve ever used. now me being the internet/cp retard I’ve been known to be, I know that isn't that impressive. On that note though look at what you can do with it. you can advertise a band(and don't think the record industry ain't lookin), but for me I’ve located so many friends that I wanted to open a line of communication with, and found people I thought I might never talk to again. I’m so glad i heard of thios fuckin site. To all my friends out there I raise one to you all and toast the connection we will all share for as long as were alive......friendship. and to the people who have not yet become my friend, HELL raise a glass and make a toast to the people that truly make your life shine.
Seriously though, they're starting to wind me up. There's literally no way of telling if it's going to be a nice soft one or one of those ones that isn't hard but it isn't soft, it's just in no-man's land. It's like it doesn't know what to believe anymore (since it came back from Vietnam).
And then there are others that are perfectly nice and yellow on the outside but when you peel them they're ridiculously bruised and you just feel like saying 'well i wish you'd told me the truth from the beginning to be honest mate, cos you've wasted everyone's time now'.
I might start taking them back if i take a bite and don't like it from now on, without saying a word, just placing the banana back on the till with a face that denotes exactly how i'm feeling.
My facebook has me remember how worthless the people were who I grew up with still are, except the very few, (two out of hundreds!!!), and myspace I have found handfuls of insightful, intelligent, talented, humorous, and invigorating people I thought I had lost, and others I probably would have never met on this planet. 
Due to this, I realize I could have done things differently, but that doesn't mean more worthwhile.  
And with the stimulation of new friends, I have something stirring in my soul that I haven't felt for way too long... confidence to achieve whatever the hell I want!  Just thinking about the possibilities possible, makes me feel like the old me that I admired. The old me that was about fun for everyone.  The old me that could find a use of the info I aquired that could benefit all.  The old me that felt good about myself.  Hell with a new me, I'll keep the old me.
But I can still react.
Paris is Burning is not a good film. Now someone's said it; I said it right there. It's just not. Livingston grabbed a camera, threw it on her shoulder, and made sure the lens was open as a number of nonwhite, transgendered people talked and vogued. I won't get started on intentionality, but I have to say this: Jennie Livingston didn't know what she was doing!
And, believe it or not, that's part of what makes it fascinating to talk about. Because we co-sponsored the event with Honors Humanities, the night's focus was on the film's characters and culture, and (I believe) less about it as a film.
To show you why I think it's an important movie to show, but without taking a long time to elaborate, I've instead listed a literal block of film-related questions you might think about the next time you see Paris is Burning.
What kinds of contrast do the scenes of white people walking around the city provide? Does the overlayed music somehow influence the audience's reaction to these scenes? How does the film's structuring privilege certain characters, or does it at all? In what way is Dorian Corey portrayed in the film? Does this influence the audience's reaction to her? How can the audience include Corey, the lone critical voice in the film, as they consider the movie's framework? What do the white on black introductions mean for the audience's understanding of the film? Do they provide a coherent structure? How else might everything have been organized? Should audience members be concerned that Venus Xtravaganza's death seems glossed over at the end? What does that mean for how other characters are treated in the film?
I met a friend at McDonalds for breakfast this morning...yeah, I actually got up early on my day off...go figure!

February in Phoenix is like a Spring day in Ohio...I woke up and the weather was cool, but great.  Less then a month left, and I will have lived here for a year, it's hard to believe.

Okay, so I met up with Brad, and we sat down and just chatted and caught up with what's happened since the last time we met (Which was a couple of months ago, I just see him for a few minutes at work a couple times a week, can't really talk all that much then.)

So I'm drinking my HOT coffee without the lid, and this lady doesn't sit down "Lady like" on the seat behind me, she just PLOPS down real hard.  Hard enough for me to bounce off my seat and feel the HOT liquid spill all over the table AND my thighs.  (I'm not an 80 yr old woman, but I wonder if I can sue Mickey Dee's for faulty booths?!?...just sayin')

Brad and I just laughed at the sight of the coffee all over the table, and sopped it up with napkins and continued our talking...and then it started.

Well before "IT" started, the lady would get up, and Brad would give me eye contact indicating that she was going to sit down again.  It got to the point where I put the coffee out of harms way...in other words on the other side of the table out of my hands!

THEN it started!...she had to have had a lot of nervous energy, because my seat started shaking, I think to the point of where Brad even saw me bouncing up and down.  (I'm not even kidding!).  We decided to move to another table, and I looked back at her, and sure enough her leg was bouncing up and down.  We dumped our trays and sat in a more peaceful environment.

So my adventures in eating at the McCafe!

So requirin' minds wanna know, have you experienced something similar to this in your dining adventures?
A couple of weeks ago, we went to the casino to watch some shows, gamble a little and hang out with some of her friends.  It was around 5:30 am when we were wating for a cab outside the casino.   She was dressed in her cultural attire, not her workaday business attire.  She's Cherokee.  She was wearing a black leather jacket with the long, thin leather tassles (about a foot long) and asked me to dance to the piped music in the foyer of the casino hotel.  So we did.  I just kinda swayed from side to side as I watched her.  She danced, and the leather tassles just swung in rhythm to her deliberate movements.  Grace.  Wow.  At least I thought so.....we were both well under the influence..

I love her spirituality as well.  She follows traditional native spiritual ideals.  She smudges regularly, participates in sweats.  I know so little of the cultural rituals, although we have discussed them on occasion.  

Anyway, what I am getting at is that there is so much about her I love.  I love that way back when.....at the time when my wife declined so quickly, and then when my son was severely injured, that she was one who I could rely on to give me another perspective.  I only knew her online then.  Four years ago, we started to talk.  Only in the last while did we meet.  She is exactly what she portrayed online, except for the physicality.  We really never discussed that.

So yes, I love her.  Is this something that will result in us getting together on a permanent basis, type deal?  Likely not.  I love her in that I really care how she is.  When she hurts, I feel it.  When she is happy, it makes me smile.  But it won't likely happen since I can't see our different lives meshing.  I know she knows that too.  It's a different thing than I have experienced before.  Not really sure......who knows.
It's nice to be back home, in familiar surroundings, but it's sad too, all at the same time. It means that the break is virtually over - work starts all over again on Monday, but, as Sally rightly pointed out, it's not long till Easter, and even out June two week holiday isn't that far away. (guess, we'd better get it booked then)

Did we enjoy our time in Northumberland? Overall yes. Would we go back? Yes. To the same place? Probably. At the same time of the year? No. Right place - wrong time we think.

We went food shopping when we got back home, and saw more people in Sainsburys alone than we had seen the whole time we were away! I mean, the shop was even OPEN. At 3 in the afternoon! Come on, all the shops would have been long shut where we've been by that time on a Saturday afternoon! ;-)

So, where are we thinking of for June? Wales is the favourite again at the moment. The site we stayed at near St Davids in the yurt last year now have the self catering apartment fully up and running, and that is available when we want to go, for either one or two weeks. But, we are thinking about going there for the first week, and then moving on to the Gower Peninsular for the second week, and have found some good looking cottages/flats that are available then for a sensible price - we just need to get a move on and decide which.
It seems as the past few days everything has been crashing down on me. It's only 8 days away from my birthday and this is supposed to be happy and a joyful time. The girl I wanna be with doesn't know if she wants to be with me. My dad's best friend died 5 years ago on my birthday. I obviously don't like Christmas or my birthday anymore. School is beginning to get tougher, I'm sleeping less, and finding a job is still almost impossible. The economy only seems to be getting worse as time goes by, and our wonderful country seems to be deeper in debt. This is cool, right? In my opinion I think our government is the terrorists. They raise taxes to bail out the banks, they also give there self's raises over night. I think 9/11 was something the government did themselves. I'm not very up to date with political problems and what not, but like I said these are my opinions. Life just sucks....

"When life give's you lemons, make lemonade!"
Yesterday was the typical Saturday.  Up early and on my way to a job.  It seems like more and more I'm working every Saturday.  Partly because business is good, and partly because some things I have to do are better done when employees of clients are not around to get in my way.  Yesterday's adventure was to change the lamps and ballasts of ten recessed compact fluorescent fixtures located over the grand entrance stairs of a giant software company.
Simple, right?
I had to rent special scaffolding that is designed to be used over stairs.  I had to drive twenty miles down to San o Haze Friday with my personal truck and trailer to pick up the scaffold because it wouldn't fit into my company van.  Loaded and ready, I headed for the Dumbarton bridge and Shallow Alto as the sun was rising Saturday morning.
For several years, I have had an automated toll paying device that allows me to zip through without having to interact with a human toll collector.  Because of the multi axle trailer I was pulling, I opted to pay cash for the toll so I would have a receipt to turn in for reimbursement of the eight dollars it was going to cost to cross the bridge.
Well where I start. I received my nickname "Gump" from my beloved wife Pat 42 years ago. I met her while driving my 1967 GT Mustang around town. The traffic light at the corner next to the post office turned red. This little girl with blond hair and blue eyes sitting on the steps hollered hey guy how about a ride! The rest is history as it was truly love at first sight. Forty one beautiful years later after a marriage made in Heaven ended this past February 21st at 8:05 AM as the love of my life lost her long battle with cancer. She gave unconditional love to me, our children, grandchildren and family. She was in short, the heartbeat of the entire family. This past twelve months without her is still unbearable at times. Everything that once held meaning has lost it. If I am healing or coming to terms with it, it is going very slow with still daily bouts of tears and depression. She was like a moonbeam that you could not hold in your hand, but just enjoy every minute of her presence. So I trudge on alone now living one day at a time, sometimes an hour at a time. The good thing is I still have my family who loves me very much. I have two daughters, Missy and Tina. I also have a son, Richie. I tend to lean on Tina the most. She has been taking care of me every day. She truly reflects her mother’s love beyond measure. So why did I come to MySpace? Maybe to find new friends who have already made this journey. Someone to share their thoughts with me and in tern maybe I can be some help to them. I love music, poetry, love stories~with happy endings~ and life. Yes I still love life and all its beauty. I'm not sure what waits on the other side, but I enjoy life on this side. So as my journey continues until I am called Home, I'll do the best that I can do. It is the least that I can do for the memory of my beautiful wife Pat....
Ok so this is my very first shot at blogging, not sure why I'm doing this I just have a need to try some new things so here we go. I think seeing as this is called St. John's livin I will focus on goings on in my city mostly because I often feel guilty when I think there is nothing to do here.

A few of my friends have there hands in things that not everyone knows about so I will reference them often. Stephanie writes for a local paper she reviews plays and shows for them, also she writes a fashoin piece for them as well. Ian has his own photgraphy site and it is picking up steam www.ianvardy.com and Ashley is a dance teacher here in the city that has great connections in the local hip-hop scence which is also growing by pops and locks everyday.

Now I know the way my mind works so there is no way I will be able to stick to the idea that this is only going to be about local art and music scene, more often then not this will be my random mind grapes being stomped out into the blogosphere. With that being said I am going to Toronto tomorrow for a family wedding(allways interesting) and I'm also going to try and catch a hip hop class while there, so when I get back I'll chat about that and go from there.
Well, I was gone and now I am back. I have been doing that a lot lately. Life has been busy and I am sure it has been that way with you guys too. Life is still the same out here other than being busier. Its still up in the air about custody of my son Ian but things seem to be going in my favor. The state, Department of Human Services, my lawyer, and Ian’s Lawyer are all recommending that he is placed permanently with me. Of course Chelseas lawyer is recommending he is returned to her. But that is what he is being paid to do. I am sure if he wasn’t he wouldn’t. She is still trying to tell everyone that I take my kids from their mothers just because I have all my kids.

Could she prove her stupidity any better?!? I got Matthew because his mother let her boyfriend beat on him like he is some kind of whipping boy. The state took him away from her and terminated her rights thinking I was dead because that’s what she told them. Only after I found out where my son was and proved that I was his father did the state give him to me. I got John when his mom was having some problems. Texas Child Protective Services placed him with me and his mom agreed with me is the best place for Little John. He is a daddies boy. From the day he was born he has been in his daddies arms. And I share custody of my son Brandon and my daughter Kailyn with their mom. So how in the hell do I take my kids from their mothers?!?

Sorry, I had to get that out of my system. Its been pissing me off.

Other than that things are still the same. No personal life to speak of (Dont blame them, what woman would want this kind of drama?), constantly working to improve the house, and tooling around the back roads in my car to relieve stress. I haven’t even had time to sit down and write anything.

But, the kids are getting bigger, Matts raised his grades significantly (Now I have to give back his ps2 and listen to that shit all day.), Kailyn is getting into more stuff than ever, and Brandons mom got him the worst haircut I have ever seen on the boy. He has a big head already and his mom got his hair cut waaaay to high and now he not only looks like he has a big head, but a fat one too. And she wont let me cut the rest of it off so it wont look so bad. But damn, it already looks bad! That’s it! That woman will not ever choose his haircuts again! Besides, the barber shop is a father/son thing. Beauty parlor my ass. The boy needs to start seeing a real barber. Maybe then they wont make him look like he has a fat head.

It seems like I have missed a lot on here but I see all the old wars are still going. All I can do is sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show. You could say something to the tards but it wouldn’t do any good, they will still be a tard tomorrow. At least it takes my mind off of all my crap. I can watch them and think,' My shit would be a whole lot worse if I was a dumb as them.' Thankfully there are a few of us that aren’t that stupid. 

Well, that what’s going on in my part of the world. While I am listening to my son rock out on guitar hero all friggin day why don’t you all drop me a comment letting me know how ya'll are doing?
Flirting is fun. It provides verification for us as being attractive to the opposite sex. It also provides the Macaroni to our steak dinner now and then that gives us the spice in our lives to constantly strive to renew our sexual relationship at home. My wife and I broke through the monotony of our everyday relationship by discovering the joys of “sexing”. We had forgotten the joys of flirting between each other when; after all, our whole RELATIONSHIP was based on our first flirting exchange.

If you are married, that is your goal. To take the innocent flirtations of everyday life home, and use them to further your relationship there. We get stale, and sometimes that one smile from a returned flirtation gives us the confidence to go home and show our S.O. just how desirable we can be.

    If you guys are single, get to it. There is nothing more attractive than someone who has mastered the art of flirting with confidence. If you need help…as always…I am here for you to try out your flirting on.
..This morning I feel like someone ran over me with a Semi while I was looking somewhere else.  I didn't do anything yesterday to deserve all of this misery and the Sun is shining so my mood should be good.  Even the hair on my head feels like someone is trying to break it in half.  I did not have a good nights sleep but I could not figure out why I kept waking up about every hour and a half.  Even the coffee this morning does not clear my head.  I hope this clears up soon as we are heading down to Chicago tomorrow morning to visit with the middle daughter and introduce the Brown dog to where she is going to spend the month of April while we head out to Arizona for the muddy season.  I was looking forward to our upcoming trip but I sure don't want to start it feeling like this.  Even typing is painful as the hands feel more like hot burning lead and do not get better with usage.  I think I will go dip them in hot coffee.  Later
I am a vicious drinker, but a gentile drunk. I have more stress than people realize, with the potential to let just about anything roll off my back. Gross things that normal people would barf over don't bother me, but I can't stand a messy house. I’m randomly on time, but I always show up. Being stuck in boring conversation makes me want a revolver stuck to my head, but I love carousing threw crowds to find new topics. I have acute paranoia, but am very trusting. I'm bigger better stronger faster, yet streamlined refined downtown and on the ground. my nose is too big, but fits my face well. My eyes are brown, my hair black, and skin hairy and pale. I’m irish, german, and native american, that I know of. my temper is very big while my fuse is miles long. i have entirely too much time on my hands, but not enough money to make it count. I like breakfast in the evening, and dinner in the morning. my thought processes often hinder me, due to the fact that I think way too much. I hold those close to me dear in my heart, but purposefully fail to love those undeserving of my affection. I'm your worst nightmare, your best friend, public enemy, and hero of the day. violence tends to grab me, and loss of freedom sickens me. Some might say I'm philosopher, while others would claim I’m a moron. I value intelligence, while spitting on stupidity. You’ll know everything you need to know about me in 30 mins., then I will proceed to surprise you the rest of your life. 

I'm the best there is at what I do.
Oze
For whatever reason, I was up in time to watch the trainwreck that was the "Tiger Woods Mea Culpa and Press Conference". For a time, I wasn't sure if I was watching Tiger or a repeat of the opening episode of "The Good Wife".
For what it's worth, this wasn't a "Press Conference" so much as it was a "Public Profession of Sins and a Plea For Forgiveness". No questions were allowed. Tiger stood behind a podium, read his speech, acknowledged that he had made "mistakes" and asked for the media to leave his wife and child alone. He took all the blame upon himself (which was admirable) and dispelled the rumors that his wife, Elin, had wailed on him with a 9-iron for his indiscretions by stating that they had never had any episodes of Domestic Abuse.

There were a few Tiger supporters there...but Elin was conspicuously absent.
OK- It's time for my hip replacement. 

As many of you know, after retiring, I joined the circus. Jumbo the Elephant would wrap his trunk around my right leg as I juggled small appliances -- toasters, blenders, coffee grinders. A crowd pleaser, but this probably was the original source of my troubles. When Joey (the human cannon ball) got the H1N1 last spring, circus management asked me to step into the act. The first landings went well, but those sudden accelerations from the cannon applied great pressure to my already weakened right leg. Then, I sort of over shot the landing net -- and well, met some very nice people in the audience. The MRI of my hip, which many of you will receive in our Christmas card, captured the true cost of my fond circus dreams. 

So, I have cancelled my audition for Riverdance and my subscription to Pole Vaulter Monthly. 

And in the prophetic words of Goldie Hawn of Laugh In: Socket To Me. 

More later...

Here are a few random uncompleted items off of my Life List that might spark your thinking. I won't get through them all yet, but I'll cross a few of these off in the next 90 days.
I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening. 

Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven.

Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon's restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I've eaten at a Damon's restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too.

Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave..... All in all a pretty full weekend and it's only Sunday morning. The Penguins play tonight at five and I'm already wearing my new white Jordan Staal jersey in anticipation..... let’s go Pens

I desperately wanted to do some photography this weekend. But every time I stepped out of the house I became uninspired by this bleak New England winter, the colorless landscape, the harsh mid-day lights, and all the ugly people. I don't know why anyone would want to come to America.

So I spent much of my weekend watching Boys over Flowers (Korean drama). Plus I did my taxes, spent a lot of time in my kitchen cooking, ran some errands, and join some friends for dinner at their house Saturday night for hotpot. Overall, an uneventful weekend.

Most of the time, I sat there by my phone wondering when someone would call me up to go hang out. I was too proud to call anyone else up of course. Anything would have done really. It's been awhile since I've experienced this kind of isolation. But I guess you need these kind of weekends once in awhile to put life into perspective. One day when everyone is settled down with family there'll be no one around to hang out with, no snowboarding trips, no birthday dinners with friends, no clubbing, and no meeting up for lunch.

I know I tell everyone that I rather be single; that family life just seems so boring. I make a lot of excuses of why I rather not be in a relationship or ask this or that girl out. But after much thought about this I realized that I'm terrified. Not of asking a girl out, but that I'll end up in another relationship where I'll be miserable and she ends up breaking my heart again. So I've been avoiding relationships like the plague.

But if I don't overcome this fear, then I'll end up seeing more of my weekends like this one when everyone finally settles down. What will I do then?
Life is an illusion, as the Buddhists say. Life is simply a test, as the Christians suggest. Yet with its horrors and glories combined, it is a wondrous experience with tearing negativity and soothing hands that caress in a way that can only be described as yin-and-yang… I am here.

    This feeling in me, is of none I have ever experienced. I once lie in my bed, dreading the morning, wishing to myself that this all be a dream. I had pondered whether or not I was just a thought, an illusion, a dream in the mind of the creator. Pain and anguish flourished in my life: I hoped that reality (my reality) was a dream.

    As I lay here, in another’s bed, cast out of the tides of ravish: into the stream of consciousness -- I feel like the world is passing me by. Helplessness overcomes me as I sit on the bottom of the stream and the currents of my life pass me rapidly. The rivers of time will erode me into sad, dust. Yet as everybody around me comes and goes like seasons -- how they spring to life, stabilize, grow weary, and then fade into the cold -- I am in the midst of a Renaissance.

    Like my younger days, I lie in bed thinking life to be a dream, I hold my pillow close saying, “five more minutes.”
I've had some nasty experiences with dentist over the years. In fact I'm sort of glad you have posted this 'cos I might dig out a letter I sent in a moment of pique to my dentist surgery. I'll dig it out and post it.

My own teeth - despite regular servicing and dental care - are falling like that pack of dominoes. I have few at the back to usefully chew. This makes me favor my front teeth for chewing which has the effect of making me accidentally bite and chew my lips. But I hate the idea of falsies; though I have heard that they are better than the wooden ones they offered folk when I was much younger.
I cannot believe the politicians we send to office. Are the politicians so afraid of not being reelected that they will not give an up or down vote?

I believe that everyone should have access to healthcare, and healthcare needs to be reformed at the most basic level. It frustrates me knowing the politicians do not have the courage to represent the people. It seems every topic is split between the party lines. 

No politician is working for the good of the people, they are all worried about playing politics. It's actually disgusting. Come November I plan on a clean sweep.... my personal belief is, two terms and you're out. Enough of career politicians, enough of politics as usual, enough of this nonsense.
