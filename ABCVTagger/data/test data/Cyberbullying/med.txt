i just got involved with someone and i really like them alot...but they are in a relationship with someone..and now they asked me to send some nude pics.
I broke up w/ my bf cuz he was   always texting me to kno where I am n who im wâ€¦so I posted his texts on my fb wall so everyone could see how crzy he is
This girl who is obsessed with me sent me a naked pic.  She's annoying but she's hot so I forwarded it to a cpl friends. I know they didn't share it.
I text my man all the time 2 c where hes at.If he dont write back, i call him from a blocked #. hes so shady.
This nerd at school made this blog where he posts all the gossip in our school and uses it to make fun of popular kids. He doesnt talk about me tho
i was just pressured to send nude photos to my boyfriend
The girl I was dating started obviously tweeting harsh things about me on twitter. So i got all my friends to retweet mean things I said about her. 
I started a facebook group about our gym teacher being a perv. My school suspended me for 2 days for it. But the grp got over 100 members!!!!! So clearly people agree with me. 
"My boyfriend started a rule that i have to text him atleast once every hour. He calls it ""***'s minute."" I think its kinda cute tho, lol"
My crush at schl tweets about where he is and the parties/events he's going to and stuff all the time. So sometimes I'll just show up at some of the places he's at. Now he is calling me a stalker on twitter.
We found this cell phone at a restaurant I work in. We tried texting some contacts to see if we could find the owner, but we stumbled across some racy pic messages apparently from the owner's gf. We ended up blowing them up & hung up in the kitchen. 
I know someone who had some private pictures of herself in her phone & some creep got his hands on her phone and sent it to themselves. Although the pictures were meant for her use only, they werent password protected.
My Ex boyfriend won't leave me alone, he texts and facebook chats me at least once a week even though I haven't seen him in over a year and a half. He is rude, volgur, and disgusting. I just want him to leave me alone. Why won't he just GO AWAY!!!!
My *buddy of 8 years asked me if we could videotape us having sex this weekend, since he lives in another city and this way we can have something to remind us of our times. I trust him, but worry it'll end up online somehow, someday. 
Me and my ex were together for over a year and he all of a sudden says he no longer loves me. Then tells me we might be able to work out. Then texts me saying that he never loved me, that he just used me for sex, & that he got sex from other girls.
I was texting my ex and he texted me that when i grow up no one is ever going to want to marry me so i better take him back because i wasn't going to get anyone better.   
I have had girls say some hella mean things on myspace. And then when I confronted them in person, they were totally denying it. Saying that their profiles must have been hacked. People feel so tough online. There are no consaquences for your actions
There was a person who created a Facebook, Twitter and YouTube profile using my image. The cyberbully or cyberstalker is  jealous of other people's success. 
I sent pics and was scared cuz it wasn't my phone. My bf talked me into it. I was so scared that after we broke up he was going to send them to his friends. I will never know if he did cuz i never asked him
i had broke up with my boyfriend and he got really mad and now he is telling everyone that i did have sex with him and now a lot of guys are comming up to me and like pinching me in my a**
coaching basketball, i once shouted at one of my players calling him retarded for committing three turnovers in a row...only to look over to see that the other team had a kid with downs on the team
My boyfriend broke up with me because I won't do certain things sexually. And he cheated.   I have a few naked photos of him he doesn't know about.  I want to send them around because he has a small one and its hilarious.  Fair game?
At a high school basketball game I hadn't been paying attention to the final ten minutes of the blow out. I glanced to see no one shouting at a kid shooting a free throw and yelled for him to miss. He missed and I realized the kid was retarded
im dating a REALLY mean girl, she plays cruel head games, ALWAYS makes me pay when we go out.  im thinkin of goin to a $$$$ restaurant and in the middle, go to the bathrm, but just sneak out, leaving her w/ the check (and she'll have to find a ride)
I hang out often with a married woman (I am also married), and in order to do so I am forced to tell my wife that I am working late, as she would not approve of me hanging out with ANY woman alone and without her.  I think she's unreasonable.  
My boyfriend insists that he should be able to read all of my txts because we are dating. He said this makes us open and honest.
my best friend and i slept together. i knew he had a girlfriend and told him i wasn't comfortable with him cheating on her with me, but after a few drinks he seduced me into it. Now he won't talk to me cause its my fault...
I want to have web cam sex and my wife says thats cheating?
My ex-boyfriend, who i wasn't even going out with at the time, kept asking me to send him naked photos. when i said no, he told all of his friends, and his friends were coming up to me calling me prude, or a ******. 
I have had a girlfriend for about a year now, and never will cheat on her but am constantly flirting with and texting other girls, especially ones ive hooked up with before. Bad?
ok what about if me and my gf are in a big fight , and she started by posting embrsing stuff on my wall....is it ever ok to settle the score online?  or always over the line?
I commented on some of my cousins pictures on myspace they were just questions mostly she got mad for some reason and she told me mean things I decided to write her back and called her worst things. I will never forget what I did cause I got punished
"I have this friend -yes it is a friend and not me - that has pictures and videos of himself in provacative poses and with his member out there and other pictures of his ""conquests"". And he is so open about it and he doesn't feel bad at all. Its wrong"
My bf was pressuring me to take a naked pic I always said no. I thought since he loved me y not send him one & I did but the pics didn't show my privates. But he got his phone stolen & had saved those pics to his phone now sum1 has obscene pics of me
I have sent a topless picture to a guy before and he told me he promised not to show anyone and i dont know if i should believe him. I dont go to that school anymore so i dont know if anyone has seen it. And im really scared. what should i do?
soo there is a guy that i have had a thing with. so when things got heated one night and i made the mistake of sending him naked pictures of me. since then we havent talked but im still unconfortable knowing that he has the pics. should i worry?
I used to cyber with anyone who take me.Just Text-but now i'm afaid where it's going end up-because i don't always do fake and poeple have seen my forehead.
i got grounded and caught for sending a picture of me in bra and underwear. i learned my lesson for doing wrong
i sent pictures 2 a guy i talked to,later i got a boyfriend&he is friends w/ the other guys cuz.him&his cuz ended up drunk&showed the pictures to him,the cuz told my boyfriend&he almost broke up w/me&faught the guy.Luckly it all worked out.
A girl that my fiance was cheating on me with made a fake facebook to message me n told me about the affair after he cut it of with her 
"my boyfriend is ""reconnecting"" with a girl that he used know at church. They blog to each other and talk almost every nite. He says its nothing but why is that he'll do things like that with her but doesnt put much effort into our relationship."
i sent a pic to this boy just cause he was begging , i never really liked him , i dont think he showed anyone but i do regret it. 
i said somethinq to some1 on formspring be4 that was mean && i said i was just kiddinq..but i was actually dead serious. But, thatsz prob. y i dont have a formspring because im scared of what people will say about me and what they really think.
I found out my boyfriends ex, whom he's still friends with, was making fun of me so I typed her a really aggressive FB message saying that she needed to get a life and stop being so insecure. She deleted her FB the next day. she doesnt even know me!
i HAD a bf when i was 12 that was 16 , he never forced me into having sex, but now that i look at him , hes yuck , i regret everything i did with him.
"ive been w/ my bf for 4years and it wasnt until 2months ago when i found out his ""friend""  sent him some naked pics. he confessed and deleted them, but now im unable to trust him and going through his texts/email. What to do?i dont trust him anymore!"
i started talking to my ex again after he broke up with the other girl and she started calling me nasty names and posting stuff to his fb so i tried to be nice about everything but she didnt want to hear it and now wont say anything to defend me
when me & an ex broke up a few years ago , he went and got a new girlfriend a week later it hurt me so i trashed his new girlfriend online for a while. i finally got over it but she hasnt & continues to do so and its been over 2 years now . crazy !
My bf & I have been going out for almost a year now, & even after talking to him about it, he continues to not do anything about girls sending him innapropriate txts/pictures plus he has this whole different persona on MySpace that doesn't include me
Me & My ex boyfriend still talk after we broke up. Now he has been really start 2 flirt with me ALOT! & he just asked me if i wanted to have sex with him . But i don't know if i want 2 . & i'm one of those girls who ALWAYS say NO!
my ex and i had some trust issues... i did look through his phoNE, i found naked pictures to an ex. I understand i shouldn't have looked through the phone, but should I stay with him?
I logged into my boyfriends account just to see who he's been talking too. I've done this before, and I promised him I wouldn't, but I just can't help it. It's really beginning to become a problem. Curiousity killed that cat, right?
me and my boyfriend has been dating for almost a year now, and i keep checking his facebook and myspace alot to see who hes been talking to, and i check his phone too sometimes. Iam really paranoid hes goin 2 cheat, even when he goes out i call alot.
I had a bf who i was going out for 4 mons. He went away for a trip with his fam nd while ovr there he would ask me for pics, bt never fully naked. Later on the day b4 he came bck broke up with me nd started seeing a new girl that friday i felt stupid
I just broke up with my ex after 7 months and she blames me for it though it was my choice. She has trashed me on Facebook, constantly berating me and screwed with my VF account and claims he's better than me. Is it wrong to want revenge against her?
"My boyfriend is constantly texting me asking me what I'm doing, where I'm at, and who I'm with. If I don't respond w/in a couple of minutes he freaks out and sends texts saying ""Fine I'm gonna go do what I want now"" and ""Thanks for ignoring me. Bye."""
"Like ""where you at?"", my ex-gf/fiancee had to tell me with every meaningless detail! How many times did I want to answer WHAT!! When I didn't call her she got depressed and act moody. Why did I put up with this for 2 years?? I changed the number!"
My boyfriend reads all my text messages when I'm not looking. Sometimes it feels like he doesn't trust me. Do you think that's over the line?
my boyfriend threatens to break up with my if I don't delete my myspace/facebook accounts, I've deleted them before, but made new ones, eventually he broke up with me and now my EX-boyfriend tells me if I dont' delete my stuff he wont talk to me...
my bf is always texting a girl he used to cheat on me with .eventho its been a yr since theyve done anything they still text an talk all the time.he says that shes just a friend but hes always on his phone an  is so secretive bout it.
What ***s done:talked to some girl constantly.even more then me.walked away when she called.hooked up w her when we broke up bc of her.dated him again for some reason.had pic of my bestfriend in his ipod.Man it was not worth it. digital drama sucks
my bf & i have been together for 2 years over the summer he went to the beach & met a girl while he was there he broke up with me then came home & wanted me back the beach trip is coming up again & im worried hell break my heart again. should i be?
I was with my girl friend for a year and 3 months and I found out a few months back that she had a problem with making fake profiles on facebook & myspace. She ends up breaking up with me so she could go back to her pretend lives. Idk what to do...
my boyfriend is always talking to girls on facebook. The only way the would stop talking is if i get into his page and tell them that he has a girlfriend. if i tell him to do it he SAYS he will but never does. i WANT to trust him but cant WHAT TO DO?
When i have my phone my boyfriend texts me non-stop and when i dont he wont answer ANY of my calls. i feel like theres no balance or trut in our relationship and its worrying me. idk what to do...
My bf is always on his cell. We're constantly arguing bcuz when I call him he doesn't answer, or it'll take him 4ever 2 return my call, but when it's his friends calling he ALWAYS answers. What's up with that?
My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship so the only way we can communicate is threw Texting and Calling. We try and stay in touch as much as we can but sometimes he will go 3 days to 3 weeks without returning any of my calls or Texts!!
A  couple of weeks ago I stupidly sent this naked photo of myself to this guy I only knew for about a week. I thought he loved me then I hear from my friend he showed it to someone. I asked him and he said he didnt, I want to know what to say to him

"I already block and delete someone but since we  have a common friend that person told our common friend to tell me ""I can see what your are doing"" as if I don't have the right to post anything I want on my on wall"
My cousin got married 11 months to the day my sister (her cousin) died unexspectedly and I got really mad  and now my whole family thinks Im nothing but a monster for getting mad. Was I over reacting? Was I over the top? Or was she disrespectful?????

I visited my longdistance BF and posted our pictures on FB when I came back home. A week later a girl started tagging photos of him and I discovered they were IDENTICAL to mine. It was her way to let me know he was cheating on me with her.
Left a comment on someone's page only to be scolded saying that I was never asked to comment..It then turned into a comment fighting war when they did not like what i said. Then immediately after I was blocked from the person's page. *****
My 'friends' (at least they act like it sometimes) sometimes call me retarded, stupid, and an idiot. Sometimes it's funny, but other times I think they really mean it, even when they say they are kidding.

Few years ago, a guy or girl was posting something on zacefronfan.org about something awful about me but they weren`t from school and they kept attack everytime I  go online. I don`t know what to do about this/ :(
My boyfriend keeps texting me all the time, from morning til night usually. He always asks what i'm doing and what my plans were. At first, it seemed really cute tht he cared so much. But now it's like an every day occurance. What should i do?
"Alright so I'm getting dragged into a lot of fights lately, most of them between both friends of mine. I said one thing like ""she's so skinny why did you call her fat?"" to one friend and find out she told the other girl i called her anorexic!"

Me and my ex recently just split up. At the beginning of our relationship he cheated on me. He said that it was my fault that we broke up because I had no trust in him. Haha. Seriously, would you trust someone that cheated on you? Doubt it.

My boyfriend has a couple close girl friends that I feel may be into him. I find it a little odd that he doesn't tell me when he's with either of them ever, and I'm not even sure that one of them, who kinda flirts with him, knows he has a girlfriend.
this guys been trying to get my to go out with him for weeks. and now im really starting to like him, but hes a player. none of my friends approve. but he says its different this time, do i believe him?

So my girl told me she had saved a message from me saying i'd marry her on the spot if another guy had proposed.  In seeing if she really had I came across a text saved from her exfiancee saying he wants her back.  Why save it if she didn't want him?

I've had girls post terrible things about me on their friends facebook walls. They didn't know I could see it, but I could. 
"I had this one guy trick me into thinking he was ""considering"" liking me over the summer. I have big boobs and he really wantedd to see them. It was all done over sexting and all that crap. I didn't do it but he was pressuring me."
i sent this guy nudes, but i made sure to get some from him in return so he couldnt use them against me without me doing the same to him. so he wouldnt ever do that. but is it still over the line?

I've spoken to many guys online who I didn't know personally. And most of them asked me to send them pictures. I've even had previous boyfriends, and really really close guy friends ask me to send them pictures too.
My Boyfriend of over three years asked me to marry him before he leaves for afghanistan the only problem is that I'm 17. So I told him no, I told him when he comes back I will. Now he's ignoring my calls.it's been two weeks since I've talked to him.

"I was recently diagnosed with OCD, and one of my friends keeps saying things like ""I can't wait till your meds start working,"" and she's being completely unsupportive. I she over the line, or am I just being sensitive?"
I know I crossed the line when I read my bfs emails but I found some between him n his ex that he worked wit about breaking in her bed I confronted him about it and he said it's a joke from wrk. IDK if I should believe him He said he'd never hurt me.
"recently read my bf's text, he has a crazy baby momma who is upset he has a new girl. I read one text which said. ""Stop calling me babe, maybe you mistake me for your daughter"". His excuse, he slipped. Cheating boyfriend or an honest mistake? hmmm"
So my boyfriend and I were texting while he was a t a lacrosse game, and all the sudden he just stopped. And it turns out he took another girl to the bathroom because she was scarred. I had to milk the information out of him. Is this bad?
I like this guy and he likes me back. But after a few days he started to get really into my life and asking me many personal questions I didn't want to answer. I told him I needed my own space and time and he got all mad and *****. What should I do?
I cut my brother out of my life..I never felt any real family connection to him, it all felt fake.  I know I've never needed him for anything and never would.  Is this over the line?
well im talking too this guy right now and people are telling me he is playing me  :/ and he is telling me he isn't and that he just waiting for the right time to ask me out and i dont know who i shouls trust :/ 
okay well im having sex with this guy ythat im just talking too he tells me he loves me and evrtything and  i dont know if he is just using me for sex because he likes to take pictures of me too and he doesnt share them thou,

I was with my ex whe i found out i was prego. We kept arguing so we broke up. One of my gay best friends and her ex also broke up. I convinced her ex to be with me, and were happier than ever.. is this crossing the line?
About a Year and A Half Ago, I Started Dating my Best-Friends Ex-Boyfriend. We Only Dated for One Month and we never Even Kissed, I didn't even have real feelings for Him. I learned that My Best-Friend Gave Herself to Him and Defriended Me. 
So my boyfriend thinks he dont treat me like his girlfriend. So we were talking we havnt really talked taht much becuase we have had a huge fight so he thinks its more important to talk with his friends then me to fix it what should I do?
i been dateing my bf for almost 10 month now but i still like my ex and sometime ill still talk to my ex behide my bf back and after that i feel bad about it....
One day my friend asked me something she read in my dental file when she was waiting on me. I told her i didn't appericate her going through my personal files even if it's a dental file. She blows it off and never said sorry about it so i ended it .
"Okay, my boyfriend likes to talk dirty. Really dirty. I ain't that type of person to really go along with that. He always wants my opinion though and i dont want to be mean and just say ""Stop talking to me like that. I am a person."" What should i do?"
My friend is turning into a clone of one of her friends & its not a good thing. Her friend likes to look up random porn & stuff and link it to anyone she is chatting with. Now she does it too! Among other pervy behaviors.. Has she gone over the line?
im having sex with my friend and i dont think i should tell them how i feel cuzz he is really good in bed but like he doesnt act like i am... wat should i do?
iv been wit my bf 4 6mnthz. early in the relationship he cheated,twice w/ the same girl. i decided to look pass tht but it seemz like i havnt fully gottn over it im still hurt and the girl still says she in loves him even tho im his everythin wat2do?
im totally in love with my daughters father.  and he totally acts and talks like hes in love with me too, but he has a girlfriend.  Should i go for him or let him go?
I have friends who in front of me are nice, sweet, and say things to get me to do things. But on the other hand I find out that they are speaking behind my back. How can say no and not regret feeling like I did something wrong?
Ive been with my girlfriend for 2 years already. and she moved and were in this long distant relationship. She has a guy friend that she says is like a brother to him.But she always talks about him and shes always going to his house. 
"my ex & i were dating for about 10 or 11 months before we broke up and two months later i had another boyfriend... we didnt even go out a month before i realized i loved my ex, little did i know my rebound was ""inlove with me"" and i broke his heart."
I have a formspring, and people were anonymously commenting on it saying really mean things. I considered it internet abuse and deleted my formspring. The comments really hurt my feelings. Should I have done something more?
I was dating this guy for 2months and he moved back home. its been 5 months now. He cheated on me after the first week of being together and i took him back I can't help but wonder if he's cheating on me back home even tho he says he loves me. 
so my bff has been talking to this guy for a while. they never met&she always said she wanted me to meet him with her. so we were gonna hang&then she ditched me to go meet the boy she never met without me was she wrong to go without me?
"2 year relationship with my gf now. Long distant relationship. And she has this ""guy bestfriend"". They hang out all the time and she goes over his house almost all the time. He's even introduce her to his family. Im having doubts in being with her. "

I was going through my boyfriends phone and i found a bunch of porn and naked girls. I am certin he would never cheat on me but i got upset.  Did  i have a good reason?
This guy I like took my virginity. I don't think he feels the same way for me. He said he liked me and wanted to go out with me, but this was RIGHT before we were going to have sex. Would it be foolish for me to go out with him? Please help me!
My best friend and I send pics back and forth and have phone sex if we're ever really turned on. He's also my ex but I trust him with the pictures of me, especailly since he sends me pictures of himself too. We're careful about it.
i was video chatting with my guy friend and i was with my best friend. we were in our bras and underwear. he was getting pretty turned on so me and my friend started to goof around. minutes later, we were topless. we told him he couldnt tell any1...
"This isnt about me, but my bestfriend. A ""slut"" is someone who sleeps around. My bestfriend is far from that. How can I get people to stop trash talking her on the internet and in person. I'm tired of it, but I just don't know what to do. Help?!"
Me and this guy have went out 3 times and he is always the one to break up with me but he says he loves me and he wants me to be his first time would it be stupid of me to go back out with him?
Im very friendly, and i like talking to people, but when friends constantly joke around saying im a whore, is that inappropriate? When they know im not? And then they say that im bisexual? i feel lik they are going to far and idont want to be near it
 i was dating this girl for eight months.one of our mutual friends came along and i became super protective over her.she never cheated on me but once we broke up she had sex wit him and soon after she had sex wit another guy.was i wrong 4 wat i did
My Boyfriend and I Go To Different Schools About 15 Miles Different. I Get So Annoyed Because We Dont Get To See Eachother Often And If I Ever Hang With My Friends I Have To Give Him Updates On Who Im With And What Im Doing. And I Get Upset
I hate my boyfriend. All he does is farts around me and it turns me off so much. He doesn't stop and walk away to do so. Should I confront him about it or just deal with it and smell it any ways?
i took naked pics and sent them to my bf he left them on his computer and then his ex looked through his pictures and saw a ton of naked pics !!
"At my school, it's almost as if it's ""in"" to just casually have sex with whoever, wherever. I'm totally not comfortable with that, I want my first time to be special but I'm afraid if I don't do it like everybody else, my reputation will demolish."
My BF & I Have Been Together For 3 Yrs & Honestly I Go Thru His Phone & I Dont Think He Knows I Do, But I Have Read Some Text Messages That I Didnt Like At All! It Bothers Me So Much & Idk How To Tell Him? 
my friend asked me to do his independant study homework and he would pay me $75 for it. After starting some of it a little over two weeks go by and i decide i don't want to do it and he breaks off the friendship. what the ****?? 
my boyfriend is 17 and we always share our sexual fantasies wit eachother, but we dont plan on havin sex till im 18, but would it be crossing the line to suggest anal sex? when we absolutely trust eachother? and Plan on having a future together?
i just broke up with mi Bf that was dating for a year i feel kinda bad because the reason we broke up was because i hung up on him and he just said it was over then he got all mad and started sending me rude text was that over the line ?
ive been dating this guy 4 over a year. ever since he graduated last year & i moved about 20 miles away, i barely see him. we both have our drivers licenses but he always makes me drive 2 come and see him but he never comes 2 see me. ?
well im bi and i have a bf and gf but both of them want me to be with them the whole time what do i do?!!!
last year i wanted to make mi ex jealous by tellin people that i did stuff with a guy...I REGRET that everyday of my life! him and his friends keep harrassing me and theres nothing i can do bout it cause its my fault...they thnk im something im not 
"Me and a friend of mine got into an arguement over something stupid and she desides she gonna say. ""Oh your boyfriends going to love to know how many times you've cheated on him"" Weird thing is I never have. She's trying to break us up. "
i was at my boyfriends house & we had been dating for about 3 months & he kissed me but pulled down my shirt. i got up & went home that minute but now everyone says that im stingy. i thought i was doing the right thing.
my gf tells all her friends how huge my penis to all her friends.  Everytime i see them they give me this crazy look.  she i confront her on this 
i went to a party and made out with two girls, just for fun. Well my bf went *****. Is that a big deal, since im gay?
"I had a guy ask me for a ""favor"". Being the good friend i asked what he needed. He said send me some dirty pics me and my girlfriend hare having a rought time. I told him no and he kept begging. Time after time i told him. NO. "
Is it over the line that I think money is the answer to everything

My bf cheated on his ex-gf with me and cheated on her with two other girls. His ex was long distance. We have been together now for two years. He keeps in touch with his ex openly. He says he hasn't cheated on me. Am I over the line for trusting him?

me and this guy messed around, two nights in a row, i had never met him before...now he is gone and i'll never see him again. crap
I dated this guy for 2months last year and we broke up cus i never got to see him. during the summer we messed around nd were suppose to go out when school started but we didnt now hes all i think about but he likes my best friend nd she likes him D:
so my bf has a fb and so do i. i made a new one and sent him messeges like hey sexxy and things i always tell him but it was like i was another person he didn't know. Do you think that was over the line?
OK SO. ITS BEEN ABOUT 2 MONTHS OR SO SINCE ME AND MY EX BROKE UP. I STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FEELINGS FOR HIM EXCEPT HES GOING OUT WITH THIS GIRL I HATE. SHOULD I ASK IF WE SHOULD GET BACK TOGETHER LIKE WE DID BEFORE OR LET HIM STAY WITH HIS GF????
i cheated on my boyfriend and he found out. now whenever i talk to a guy or am alone he thinks i am going to do it again.he thinks that I have no right to not trust him when he still talks to girls like he wants to get with them. is he over or am i:(
i just found sexual text on my bf fone from2 other girls. i got mad, cause i feel cheated on. i have no idea what to do. should i end it we've been together 1yr &/2. but i love him, he even got on his knees to ask for me to forgive him. who is wrong?
My boyfriend won't give me any time. No hugs, no kisses, no cuddling,... no nothing.(by the way) We're a gay couple..  He says that he's going on some spiritual mission and fasting..etc..  and that he can't touch me.. BUT he wants me to stick around
"My friend is angry @ me cuz she claims im being ""clingy"". But we never hang, and all i did is ask her once after not hangin for 2 weeks to hang out. Is she over the line for saying I'm ""clingy"" or am i ovr the line for wanting to hang out?? ~Confused"
me & my ex talk cuz we r friends but my current boyfriend doesn't like me talking to him because he thinks my ex is trying to break us up so he was caught reading my texts from my ex did he cross the line?
I look through my boyfriends phone, while he was at work, and I thought I found a girls number in his phone so i immediatley got mad &tried to break it off but come to find out he called that person and it was a friend of my family which was a guy.
im 14, and  i have a 17 year old boyfrann. There is this girl he met on the internet nd she wont stop flirting with him. And it really bothers me. Is it ok for him to respond to this girl and not tell her to leave him alone or am i jus really uptight
ALRIGHT SO MY EX WAS TEXTING ME ABOUT HIM AND HIS NEW GF. HE KEPT ASKING ME IF I WOULD BE UPSET IF HE HAD SEX WITH HER. ALL IM THINKING IS THAT WHY THE HELL IS HE TELLING ME THIS?? HE TOLD ME THAT HE WANTED ME TO BE HIS FIRST. WHAT SHOULD I TELL HIM?
i have that boy that took my virginity and were no longer together but he constantly braggs  about him being with other girls &it bothers me is this over the line?
"I hide a voice recorder under my bf bed. he Found it. Its been 2 months..he said i betrayed & lied to him. Now he's seeing other women but has me on the side. I am truely sorry. But now its like he feels he can ""get back"" at me..do i deserve that?"
so I cheated(sex) on my ex for my ex ex and after he found out he was angry then after hes been coming round and been hooking up w/ me. but the day of spring break we had sex(he lost his v-card to me) and now he doesn't talk to me! is it payback?HELP
I have an ex-friends with benefit n recently found out he has a gf. I still get tempted to go over by him even though i know its bad seeing he's taken, and he's not helping much when he keeps callin me. I hate that we act like strangers in the open
My 'ex-friend with benefit' and i was a secret but now that i try my hardest to not get tempted anymore it's like all his friends know what i been doing... they just watch me a certain way n this guy i use to like barely says hello to me now =/
"My friend is angry @ me cuz she thinks im too ""clingy"" just because i asked her 2 hang out after not hangin out for 2 weeks.... is she over the line for thinking i am ""clingy"" or was me asking to hang out.... it makes no sense why she would say that!"
A person I thought was my friend made my life miserable for a long time. She would constantly nick at my self esteem in various and every way. I recently blocked her on everything as a way to fight back. She's upset. Am I the cuplrit or is she?
theres this girl that i love, and we DATED FOR NINE  MONTHS, but then her frieind convinced her that i wasnt good enough for her, but she still calls me in the midle of the night crying, but she wont go back out with me, is she over the line?or am i?
A friend and I fooled around and everything was ok. She told me she wanted more than just hook ups. I don't need a relationship right now so I told her we'll remain friends. I've been txting her for weeks and she won't answer back. What do I do?
a guy at my school let me flurt with him and he knew i liked him and know he wont even talk to me at all cuz we have no classes together is he over the line or not
well me and my bf have been on and off alot and no we've been togehter for a while and sometimes i got thru his phone and go thru his texts sometimes its because im bored others is cause i want to see who he talks to but he does it to. is this ok?
There is this guy that i have known going on 6 years and we have always liked each other but never dated. while he was with his ex we had been talking and i wanted him to leave her and come to me and he chose her. He is single now, and wants me back.
"i'm 13 w/ a 15 yr old boyfriend. i'm in love :)  so on facebook, he;s always commenting on other girls pics saying things like ""*** is seexxyy"" this bothers me! what should i do?"
"Ok i have a friend hes getting out of hand..saying he ""wants me"" but i already have a bf. I dont want to lose my friend as a friend but i think its getting to the point ."
my boyfriend of almost three years broke up with me in april 09 while i was pregnant with his baby. we still arent together but he still kisses me and stuff he doesnt want to be with anyone in a relationship. what should i do?
Over spring break I ran into an old friend named ***. He came over and asked me to have sex with him and that he loved me and us having sex wouldn't leave his mouth, so I did.He told  everyone and my well state is ruined. Take control, dont give in
My best friend and her boyfriend have been going out for 11 months. They say that they're in love, and I believe them. But the way that they're proving it is by having sex all the time. It's at 311 right now. I don't like it. What should i do?
 One day I had to go to the ER. I had left my phone in the room with my ex while i was getting an x-ray, I come back to him going through my phone. Its bad enough when I'm in perfect health but while im in the ER getting and x-ray? Ridiculous. 
 one, he flirts with her in front of me, but two, i know he's just trying to get over his ex. I don't know how to tell him how much it bothers me, but i can't stand that he treats me like some kind of toy.
i cheated....i'm sorry. i still haven't told my boyfriend that. he doesn't deserve it, he is way too nice and amazing. he treats me well and i just go off and cheat on him. i feel horrible.
i went through my girlfriends phone and looked through her text messages . and ive cought her calling other boys baby and other stuff .
My girlfriend's phone buzzed while she was making food. The text message said some pretty explicit stuff so I read the others and found out about the affair. Normally I wouldn't ever look at someone's phone but the text just opened automatically.
I cheated on him, but only because I was mad he cheated on me.  I was going to dump him because I couldn't live with the guilt, but then something happened in his family and now he needs me more then ever.  What do I do?
So... I konw this is bad but i was reading my boyfriends texts and i found out that he was cheating on me with one of his ex's... should i tell him i went through his phone and found it?
 I went through my boyfriends phone and once found out that he was texting an old friend with a reply of sexually chain text and he told me that it was a joke. The girl he texted it to said the same. Ever since then I constantly check his phone.

"i found out that my bf was talking to ""his friend"" callin her baby. but i found out threw a friend so never really had proof, but he has cheated on me before. he says that thats her nick name. wth!"
I like this kid tht by best friend was in love with and dated. i dont think he likes me. she knows i like him but cinstsntly tells me how nice it is to kiss him, I HATE IT! i told her it hurts and i cant take it anymore. . . over the line?
my boyfriend is always right n i really wantd 2 catch him in a lie, so i went threw his fone but he erased him txts n the only 1's left were the drafts so i looked in there n he was textin his X girl i showed him n he ddnt know wht 2 say except sorry

My bf cheated on me w multiple grls at a time. Weve ben 2gether 3 yrs. Its ben ovr 6 mons since he had sex with ne1. I still cannot trust him. That's a huge prblm in our relationship. We haven't had sex since he cheated, and I thnk he will leave me.

I have 14 siblings. Well my girlfriend came over to my house to eat dinner with my family, and she got so irritated that she ended up yelling and storming out because my siblings annoyed her so much. Could she not just put up with it? I do every day.
My friend has this really ugly girlfriend and we constantly remind him that she is ugly and a ****. are we wrong to do this?
A couple months ago, I got together with some friends. I made out with a guy who already had a girlfriend. He said what she didn't know woouldn't hurt her. He sorda forced me to make out with him, I didn't really want to. Did I do the wrong thing ?
When I tell a close friend something about my feelings, she makes fun of it later on. Should I show her my emotions?
I was at my frinds slepover and her friend who's a guy said hey,lets play strip poker i kept loosing, but i had like a tank top on under my shirt and stuff And eventually he said i really wanted to see you in a bra hes been texting me a lot ever sinc

Im 18. today I was chillen with my gf of months now, and I left her alone in my room to come back to her ***** at me and texting my female cousin ***** at her. she went through my phone and saw a convo i had with my cuz. she felt like a retard
**********READ! so i was going out this guy and he would NEVER answer my calls or texts and one day i was in my bestfriends basement and i called him and then a ACCIDENTLY lost signal and he texted me and broke up w me bc of that:(********
ive been dating a coworker for 3 mths now. He has a history of using girls, but he says he wants more w me. he hates the fact that i have guy friends and i did give them up to stop arguing but got them back eventually. understandable or controlling?
Okay, so there is this girl shes always **people off and making a big deal out of NOTHING so her old bff was at the park w// me her and some others so the old bff and her started yelling then she left and her dad came a cussed out the old bff. 
"One of my bestfriends is always bein flirty with guys, and she gives into there little lies and does things with them and when these things get out to people she is crying and denying it because she ""trusted"" this guy. her new name is ***. wat to do?"
My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months now. And She is afraid to tell her parents that she is gay. I told her I would break up with her in the next week if she didn't tell them. Am i wrong for doing this?
I like wearing make-up, but I know I don't need it. Still when I wear it my boyfriend will be like that's ugly or go wash it off. It's not a huge deal to me. It just bothers me that it seems like he's calling me ugly. I know I'm not really.
"so I've been told this by my ex boyfriend, he use to say ""If you love me you'll do it"". I would always be like that's emtional and verbally abusive. He'd still do it. I'd give him the same answer. Is it over the line when anybody says that or on?"
So I did some stuff with my boyfriend a couple days ago, && then I told one person and she didn't tell anyone, and I know he didn't tell anyone but everyone knows, what should I do?!  Everyone is calling me *** and ***. D:
So im dating this girl and she get mad over the littlest things, like when i wake up and she is still in bed, ill go down stairs and leave her there to sleep she gets mad when i do that. 
TODAY WAS THE 1ST DAY ME AND MY EX HAVE TALKED IN MONTHS. HE HAS A GF. HE TOLD ME HE STILL HAS FEELING FOR ME. SO AFTER SKOOL HE GRABBED MY ARM AND STARTED TO MAKE OUT WITH ME. I PUSHED HIM AWAY AND WALKED AWAY. WERE TEXTING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
My MOM iS A * shes always giving me a hard time even when i try to do the rite thing she finds something else to yell about! ++ She doesnt buy me anything and always buys herself something & saying things that a mother shouldnt say to her daughter!
I invited my best guy friend over and then it turned out we started doing alot of stuff. He is my best friends ex and i said i wouldnt talk to him. Now he texts me and is really mean an rude. I do love him but I cant be caught dead talking to him..

This girl supposedly told me she loved me...then because of hard times she told me she wanted to take a break.....so I said okay. Two weeks later she was with another guy. Who she claimed to have hated so much. Theyve been together for 5/mo's.  :(
My boyfriend and I been together for 2 years and every summer since we been together he has completely dissappered for liike 3 months and then he would just come back like nothing happen and tell me taht he was workig 2 jobs.
I'm in love with a stripper named ***. While i eat my fruit, i stare at her at the club. She refused to change her life style for me, so i did something for her, i bought the club. She randomly quit the second day of me owning it, i'm confused.
 my man was outside in his car talking on the phone  i said if that a girl u r talking to then go b with her .his  reply was if it was a girl he would talk to her in my face.  .then later on he come back to me and said he did not mean that 
theres a REALLY cute guy who i know, and he texts me alot and asks me on dates. problem is he's a major player and he asks more than 3 girls the same thing. the other day he told me he would want to date me this summer.  
"so a couple of my ""friends"" think im spreading rumors about them, so they're totally ignoring me. and i got in a fight with one of them at lunch, and they wont believe me. if they were really my friends, they wouldnt be treating me like ****"

my boyfriend is great to me. but he always texts his ex girlfriend, who actually stole my boyfriend before this boyfriend. she already stole one guy from me, she shouldn't be trying to steal this one. especially when she broke up with him for my bf.

Going through somones phone is wrong! But when your dating a guy for 2 years and he starts acting shady, its necessary. He left his phone at home, and i found 400 messages from the same girl. HE WAS CHEATING! For one whole year!!
"i love my bf and all that but hes lied 2 me countless times and ive seen him hug other girls and hes asked out my ""friends"" and idk what 2 do.....should i break up with him or should i work things out and forget about the past..........=?=/*cOnFuSeD*"

Well i'Ve Been Talkin to this Boy for a lonq time but ihave a boyfriend and my boyfriend is the nice and sweetest ever. but my other FRIEND i've been talkin to makes me feel good n ways my bf cant what to do!?
My boyfriend and i broke up back in Jan. the only problem is nothing has changed. We're basically still together without the title. The only thing that gets me is that he still gets other females numbers. How do i make him stop???
I put my ex on psychoex.com because he cheated on me and left me and I was mad at him because he wouldn't talk to me. I also would text his exgirlfriend because she wouldn't stop calling him and tell her he never loved her.
I've had sex with only 2 guys. And the 2nd guy was his cousin. ahhh, is that wrong?
Everytime me and my friends go to parties, guys grab or slap our *** like it's theirs or they have the right to do so. Keep in mind I wear jeans so i'm not giving off the wrong impression. Guys.. it is NOT ok to just put your hands on a girl's ***.
i sent my friend a text message and told him that i thought his mom was hot and i wanted to have sex with her as a joke. she actually switched phones with him and l8r aproaced me on it. and she revealed that she wanted to have sex with me too. 
my boyfriend has never cheated on me, but last week, for the first time i went on his facebook without him knowing (i've had the password) and i found he was hitting on another girl. he said he'd never do it again, but idk.

i was havin issues with gettin over my ex then i meet this guy n i finally got over him.one night he said he loved me so i let my guard down and said 'i love you'. not even the next day he said he wanted to be friends. cause he liked someone else!
well this guy that i really liked said that he hated me and he had nothing to do with me, i told him that i liked him and thats when he said it. what should i do? we were really good friends is it over?
"well i like this guy his name is *** and he says he cares but he only calls or writes to me when he wants to get some no not sex i mean like i feel like a booty call! should i just give up on him or should i tell him how i feel /;"
i have this prob. im emo, lol but seriously i do, i just hate how my bf treats me, it sucks alot, he says he loves me but he's always out at parties& a buncha other places, and now he talks too some girl that wants to get with him. shall i end it?):
My used to b frend sent realy bad pics to her used to b bf. I told her it was wrong but she didnt care, so I told sum of my friends, but its not like they have the pic any way, was it wrong for me to do that, it's not like Im telling her to do that. 
So theres this guy i like, i think he likes me to but he only seems to want to talk about sex with me or call me babe when we , i mean i like him mite truly love him and i want to make him happt but am i just setting myself up to fail?
I was using my wouldv been girlfriends computer to check my face book page and left it open, she  saw all the inbox messages from other women taht wanted to have sex w/ me and even including some from my roomate who is a female.. she hates me now.
I like this guy and we been talking for a while he asked me how many people I had sex with and dsaid he didn't care about the number, I told him and I believe he doesn't approve and is not talkin to me anymore. Was it right for me to do?
my closest friends are all leaving me slowely. Only one of them, I actually talk to but she never asks to hang out and neither do the rest but they all hang together. And another one is always talking about me. is it time to move on?
I am really good friends with this guy. But lately all he does it ask me if i am mad at him and ask all these questions. He gets mad when i don't text him back. He also gets mad when i talk to my boyfriend..
people put carrot pieces in my hair when im not looking and now my whole heads turning orange! it makes me sad.
Okay i am a dude but i recently got a gender change and now im a gurl soo yeah and its all because as a guy i had really bad swet and peple thought thtat was gross. It wwas also bc i was arab. like aladdin. everyone called me alladin behin my back.
My boyfriend and I really wanted to have sex. He told me in advance to start taking the pill. I told him I would but I never did. We had sex and I really think I might be pregnant. Should I tell him I didn't take the pill?
my friend constantly harasses me over text and email... and calls me really hurtfull names. when i confront her, she acts all innocent...
the girl i'm hooking up with is married and has a kid.I have never had sex this good in my life.But i think i'm falling for her.She said all that is happening is we are hooking up.Should i tell her and mess every thing up?
I have trust issues but i rele luv my bf & im tryin hard 2get over them & jus trust him. We were talkin & he got quiet so i asked him wht he wz thinkin about & he said *My GF's*  it hurt me but he says it wz a mistake..i honestly dnt kno wht 2think..
I have this guy friend who gets mad when i text, talk, or hang out with my boyfriend. He also gets mad when i don't text him back. He is constanly asking what i am doing and who i am with and stuff..what should i do?! 
so i was hanging out with my boyfriend and i go to the bathroom. and when i come back hes going threw my phone reading my messages asking me who people are and hes yelling at me. and i mean i like him a lot and stuff but idk. hes too overprotective
this guy and i have been talking on and off  for months and it was always like we were already together. everytime he had a gf, he would still tell me he loved me. When we dated, i was always afraid he was doing telling other girls the same thing
I have alot of friends that every week have a different boyfriend, and ever week they say that they love tham and that they can live without them!! what do u think i should tell them?
I always said sending nudes would end up bad, and im sure i was right. I got one in return, hoping that would be enough for them not to show mine, because they knew i had one of them. Carelessly, he left his phone around nosey friends.. 
while ago my ex bf n i had gotten together. he cheated on his gf w/ me. about a month later i told his gf who still didn't know. she broke up with him but then proceded to take him back. the kid was/is bad news and idk how to make her believe me.

This girl i have been talking to for a couple weeks, we used to be friends a whille back.  He talks to me every second of the day he told me when hes not hes sad and when i fall asleep for a nap i wake up with a ton of text and missed calls.
I have severe public speaking issues. I had to read a paragraph and couldnt get through it. I went home from school. Now, everyone is being really mean to me, and Im just depressed. Advice?

My boy and I have been off n on for 1 and1/2 years. Wen we wernt 2gether he messed around with two girls and lied about it. Should I trust him?

i've been with my boyfrienI for a while now and i love him so much. He makes me feel bad sometimes and we have sex alot i sometimes don't want to but i just wanna make him happy. what do i do?!
Yes i typed alot of things to people that i wouldnt say in person. I type things about me wanting to have s*x with that person and all the things i want to do to them when i see them. i am also bisexual (i am a girl) and i tell extreme nasty to her
My girlfriend and i have a long distance relationship. sometimes I feel trapped, like she keeps me on a tight leash, even though we're hours apart. I keep breaking up with her over it, but then the next day i want her back
I'm in love with a LDS member. We see each other in private. When we're together we mess around, everything but sex. He said we cant date because i'm not mormon, but he still comes around. It makes me feel less of a person because i'm not mormon. 
So, I know I'm young, but I honestly fell in love with this boy. But, my friend dated him first for way longer than we dated. I want him back, but if I get him back, things will be bad between me and my bestfriend.There's no telling what will happen.
Okay. My boyfriend is 23 right now and I am nineteen. We have been together for over three years now. Is it wrong to ask my boyfriend if I can look at his phone, with him there, and he gets mad at me because he says I don't trust him? Advice?

so i am madly in love with my ex but he hates me&ingores me. i understand i messed up, i cheated on him&my friend called the cops on him because he tried to hit me but i wanna be with him more than anything, do you think he will eventually come back?
i like this boy who iz in the 12th grade an i am in middle school but i feel dat if i go out wit him i will not be a virgin any more cuz he already had *** an talks to alot of girls wat sould i do help
me and my boyfriend were hanging out at his house and he asked me to go get him a drink and so i did but wen i came back he was reading my text messages. 
datin bf 4 2.5 yrs. at 14 mths he said we argue tomuch week l8r we break up i find out in tht last week he cheated on me its been a yr since nd stil dnt trust him cuz he txtd her on valentines sayin she look gorgeous in her pic on fb am i ovr reactin
"Ive been going out with the same girl for a lil over 12yrs we started in middle school.. she broke up with me about 3yrs ago but still acts as if we are going out.. I feel like im trying and im just her ""safety blanket""  what do i do?? "
i've been with my boyfriend for 18 months and sex is something we just added into our relationship, i hate it when he begs to do something after i have said no, several times and he keeps going on cause he knows more than likely i'll give in.
I like this guy. He is always trying to get my attention and flirt with me. I told him we could be friends but to not cross the line. I've told him numerous times to just leave me alone but it seems like that just fuels his flirtacious mood with me.
my best friend (who is a guy) and i just went to the movies last night. i didnt tell my bf cuz he gets super super jealous and by best friend does not like my bf . we had a good time. he was very touchy and kissed me. im kinda confused.
I went out with some girl that i really liked in middle school. We went out for a very long time, but she broke up me to go out with my best friend since elementary..he said yes
My friend asked out a girl wen i said no, but the girl said ok. Later i saw her in the hall and she asked me why dont you go out w/ me and i didnt know what to say.so i asked her out. Later people been asking her if we were going out and she said no 
My good guy friend told another guy in our classes that im also friends with that he touched my boobs when he didnt. 
My mom is driving me crazy.Taking her problems out on me.It stress me out .She calls me curse words and stuff.Like if i have a coupon to go to a restaurant and i want to take she would be like cursing at me.ansd she said she would runaway from me.
I been tlking to this huy for almost a yr and he wants some pic that i really dnt want to do n i keep telling him no but he just keeps asking? i really lyk him i dnt wanna let him go
their is this college boy that i like...but a couple of my friends told me that he has std...he's a great looking fella but im undecided he trears me raelly nicely, drive me places buy me stuff he makes me feel really wanted...i dont know what to do
I flirt with my ex constantly hoping she'll come back to me. She keeps me around and i try 2 make her happy. Im cool wit her currently bf but i really want her back. I gave her my all & she still left me. All these mixed signals are killing me.
I've had a few guys ask me for nude pictures multiple times& when I refused to send any to them, they either stopped talking to me, or started throwing random insults here and there through texts. Standing up for your morals ends up with feeling bad.
"My best friend and her husband want me to ""join"" them ....I want too but think it may ruin the friendship Is this situation over the line"
i looked at the history on my boyfriends computer. he looks at porn all the time while im gone. he always watches porn with girls with big boobs and its been eating away at me so much that i want to get implants. i cant help but feel this way
I sent some pictures to a guy that said he wouldn't show anyone. He didn't at first. But my now ex-boyfriend got them sent to his phone because atleast twenty other guys saw them. My boyfriend broke up with me for my stupid mistake. 
"i been talkin 2 this guy fa 3 yrs off & on & my ex b4 last used to HATE that we communicated .. he even wanted 2 fight him|now they're ""friends"" & they been 2getha for a week now. [im inlove with them both so should i b worried? btw i tlk 2 em both]"
"I am a male and I took a picture of ""Myself"" and sent it to my girlfriend and she sent me back some. She showed all her friends so I am going to show hers."
I live  with my boyfriend and his mom but he puts games before me. He does nothing but sleep. I'm always on my own at the house because he is sleeping or on the computer. We have been off and on for 4 yrs now
I've been asked multiple times by my boyfriends and or guy friends to send a nude pic. Everytime I decline, I either get harrassed for it, insulted, or they just flat out ignore/break up with  me. I guess keeping your morals makes you a bad person?
i like this girl but she has a boyfriend, but when shes around people without him its always i dont have a boyfriend. should i pursue?
I'm in a threeway relationship but my gf keeps getting jealous of me talking to my exs. She won't let me talk to her even though I've told her I don't like her anymore. I have to hide my phone and online conversations (including facebook) from her.

My bf of 1 yr, is awesome and I love him. Everyone adores him, comes from a good family & he really takes care of me. But when we have sex he is loving until the end, so rough/degrading. It's like a stranger come out for a min or two, degrading
My neighbor and I have been hooking up but she won't allow me to tell anyone. She tells everyone that she is a virgin, it is very popular in my school. I have pics and can prove she's not a V. I just want her to admit that we are dating.
I got of rehab & my body and emotions are all messed up. I met a guy at a NA mtg and we had sex that night. We didn't do drugs. I would share this at the mtgs but he is there. I feel like a slut but I really like him. I'm not supposed to date 4 a yr.

This girl I used to talk to would text me, and if I was sleeping or busy and didnt reply within a few minutes she would re-send it! This would aggravate me so much that sometimes I just wouldn't bother replying.
My boyfriend got me a ring for xmas, both our birthstones. I never take it off. A few months later for our 1 year i got him a mans promise ring. He lost it after 2 weeks. Then got very mad at me for being upset and not wanting to wear mine. 
my ex boyfriend would look through my phone.it was okay at frist cause i had nothing to hide.iygot to the point where i would leave my purse at our lunch table and he would look through it. i left him, did i make the right chioce?
ok so ive been dating this girl and shes amazing i lover her, but my best friend likes her... and whenever hes around she pretty much flirts with him is that over ther line? I mean she always tells me she doesnt like him and gets upset if i ask her
So i left the guy i went out with for 2 yrs who controlled me all the time and cheated on me multiple times for a guy that i like who respects me and who is honest and who i trust..was that the right choice?
my x boyfriend would constantly be texting girls and i didn't find myself getting mad or threatened but when i would get texts from guys hee would flip out. i had alot of trust but when it came down to him trusting me it never happened. 
My ex boyfriend hacked my facebook and had every single thing i do on their sent to his email. because it was a hack i could not do anything about it. is that wrong? was i right to leave him?
"In middle school i was given a nick name by a guy who i rele hated he told alot of ppl and my kinder frend passed the wrd on :( I am a junior in HS and a LOT of ppl know that nick name, some ppl i dnt know ask me why they call me ""shrek"". idk wt 2 do"
me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2 years and he texts a lot of girls and say when are you gonna come see me. when i ask him about it, he says that it's just talk.. should i be suspicious about anything?
I dated a guy for over a year I loved him and he claimed to love me to, he broke up with me and i started talkin to his friend with no intentions we are now dating, he cheatd on me cuz he thought i had feelins for my ex now i have trouble trustin him

I made a huge mistake and slept with a friends ex boyfriend. It only happened once but he says he is in love with me. I don't love em and told him but liked the attention cause I had just brkn up with my bf. I feel like the worst person in the world.
I have known one of my best friends since pre-K. Thing is my BF is jealous of him because we hang out so much but I mean he lives literally 30 steps from my house. So when he comes over my BF gets really jealous and anger with me. Is this fair??
I hate when people always say jk or just kidding at a end of something rude, like if you didn't write those words it could really hurt someone thats why i mean what i say and don't just say just joking

My ex & I started talking again & he tells me he wants to have sex with me. He says the decision is up to me ultimately but he is always pressuring me to. Should I be worried that sex is all he wants with me ?
" i recently started dating a girl ..Im newly bisexual and everybodys pressuring us to have ""sex"" an i really dont want to An she wants to have sex but she wants to have a threesome wha should i do bcux i dont want to do it but i dont want to lose her"

I was talking 2 this guy for about 6 months, and then we decided to hang out. We got really close&i ended up dumping my boyfriend. Then, this girl @ my school decided she wanted 2be with him&started**** about me, and it worked and now we never talk.
I have a boyfriend for several years now, last night I went out and had sex with a guy and a girl.  I want more but feel like i'm trapped in my realtionship. Do I throw away years of stable relationship for a few weeks of mind blowing sex?
I recently got back with an ex and he claims he loves me and tells me all the time and we constantly hang out but hes so secretive when it comes to his phone and always sends such flirtatious texts to other girls..
I leave my phone turned off, in my room at home when I go to work, a few times when I came home to see it turned on. I put a password on it and came home to find out my roommate made 2 attempts to guess my password.
my parents are telling me that i cant move in with my boyfriend, but they are trying to pressure him to marry me. im 17
i read through my boyfriends text messages and look at hid recent calls because he's got girls numbers in his contacts who i hate, but says he dont text em? so wy have there number?
i call my girlfriend a pot head/ drugie because shes always doing drugs and she gets so mad but all i want her to do is stop cause when shes on them and or doing them she doesnt care about anything that has to do with me or our relationship
"My boyfriend of 3 years has been very stressed lately, but he takes it out on me. He says things like ""I can't believe I got stuck with someone like you"" but later says he takes it back. Is he a jerk or just having trouble coping with his issues?"
I told my friend that I didnt like her friends and didnt want to hang out with them becuase they do bad things like drugs/drink/steal. She told everybody what I said and now everybody hates me. She wants me to stay friends with her. I cant trust her.
I have a guy best friend who I make out with on occasion just for fun. Well he wants to take it up a notch(oral).idk is it wrong to have a friends w/ benefits thing going on if I have feelings for him
Ive been sexting periodically and never have had a problem with a guy telling his friends or showing somebody but somtimes idk if i can trust them because of their past.
my ex boyfriend cheated on me about 6 months ago, but ever since then he has been trying to prove himself as changed and he honestly is. he is going far away to college though, what if i get back with him?
So I had been talking to this guy for like 4 months and it was going really great! He asked me out and we were going strong then out of nowhere he started ignoring me and broke up with me, said he wanted to get at all girls and that he wasnt ready :(
I don't see my friend very often so we text all the time. He's 2 years older. We sometimes flirt, but we are just friends. One day he asked me for nude pictures, and I said no. He got very angry. But I forgave him, and he's been sweet ever since...
I've gone thru my bfs texts lots of times, not bc i'm a spy, i have good reasons not to trust him. Once i went thru them and found out he was drinking w/ this girl he used to like, after he promised me that he didn't. am i wrong?
My best guy friend acts cool when we hang out. but when we talk online he talks dirty to me. then when he sees me again in person he acts like nothing ever happend. or just laughs it off.
i went through my one guys friends phone and saw a converation between him and my ex BF. they were talking crap about me saying i was annoying and wont shut up about the breakup. im totally ***** but i shouldnt have looked in the 1st place..right?
i went out with my bestfriends ex bf about 1 week and a half after they broke up.
My girlfriend cheated on me in the past (we've been together for years) & she's been sketchy online, therefore my lack of trust issues I 'look over her shoulder' when she's online & I go through her cell phone. I still don't full trust her....
Im dating this girl and weve been off and on. The last time we broke up her ex bf came back into the pic and hes crazy about her, i dont exacly know how she feels about him but its not good.Even though we're going out, shes acting shady towards me. 
The guy i really like has been my first for everything so of course im going to like him alot, but im scared hes only using me and doesnt care about me at all, even though he acts like he has feelings for me, should i stop talking to him?
ok my boyfriend wants to have sex but i dont know if im ready for it yet, help me what should i say or do?
I had this boyfriend. He told me he loved me, and I loved him back. He was my first kiss. After we kissed, he started to ask for oral sex. I couldnt say no, I agreed, but knew I'd never do that. A week later I kept it clean, but he broke up with me.
I have a boyfriend, but as me and my ex continue to talk I am developing feelings for him as well. I really love my boyfriend, but my ex is my first love....I still care for him. OMG, what should I do!!!
I frequently get really frustrated with my boyfriend because it seems he doesn't care or get concerned when other guys hit on me. It makes me think he doesn't care about me, so I fantasize about other guys. Over the line?
I Know This Girl Who Askes All My Guy Friends Out And When They Say No She Tells Them To Delete Her Number And Tells Them To Never Talk To Her Again. Then She Gets Mad At Me Because All Of Them Are My Friends And She Thinks They Like Me.

me and my ex broke up. we were supposed to go back out but i got grounded. then my best friend stole him! is it wrong to hate her?
Me and a guy i know were talking about doing stuff. I would have never said the things to him in person we barely talked in person. He was using me and i was ok with it. I just wanted to feel cool i ended up not doing anything with him though.

I gave out my number to one guy online and now im getting all these unknown calls from guys wanting phone sex. but the 1 guy i gave my #, he and i didnt even have phone sex. we txtd abt music. Ik its my fault for givin out my #, but what should i do?
but i blamed my friend for the kiss not my bf so i lost a friend because of him. and then at my friends 16th birtday he was grinding against another girl when i went to get a drink. before i went to dance camp everything between me and him were great
all m the girl and him are family friends so they have known eachother for a couple of years. last night, out of the blue he IM's me and is acting like we're frinds. he was so mean when he broke up with me,
and now without talking for 2 weeks he thinks he can just talk to me like nothing happened. he's trying to make sure his on my mind, and that i will still have feelings for him so when school starts we can go back out. 
but he has done all this stuff to me, and i have never cheated on him or sent pictures to other guys,  so there's no reason for me to go back to him, he wont change. he's a player and i don't need him. but there are always going feelings for,

he calls me names like it's no big deal, then apologizes later for it. he says he doesn't know what he is saying when he says it. he can be so mean sometimes, but great at the same time..

I'm reading Over The Line and all I'm seeing are these stories about how these young girls are getting prego and don't know who the dad is because they slept with multiple people. No doubt about it, it's inappropriate and over the line.
I'm kinda heavy and I get made fun of a lot for it, me and my friends joke about it but one of them takes it over. She's kinda **** about it and I've confronted her about it. She's my best friend, but I don't know what to do, should we be  friends?
I wanna know why girls always like the guys who are jerks to them. And then can never get over them, after that one dude uses them for w.e reason he wanted them for in the 1st place. Is that over the line or wat?
So I have an ex whom I had a long-distance relashionship with. I text him every once in a while to see how hes doing, as frineds. I have a bf and he knows and he always seems to respond back rudly everytime I text him. Should I continue or stop?

My supervisor makes fun of me A LOT. I'm starting to say sarcastic comments back, and now he's treating more like an equal. I know it's wrong to make those comments, but I like being accepted by my boss.  I'm so torn... HELP PLEASE!
I have a friend whos bf yells at her and then apologizes right after. She takes him back everytime he does stuff like that. I dont want to tell her I'm dissappointed in her for taking him back, bc then she might not tell me everything.I need advice. 
well these girls at school think they have the right to talk about everyone when they don't. i really dont like them and im being honest. they think what they say doesn't hurt but it really does. 
I've been dating my bf for 6 months & I've gave 'everything' I have to him. I don't really regret it but I worry about his past. Iknow he wouldn't cheat on me, but i've been hurt so much it'salliknow. That & he's turning 18 & it's going to be illegal
i was talking to a girl for about 4 months. i felt as if she never treated me right, and i would tell my female friends about it and ask them advice. my friends now all hate the girl. and the girl ended it w/ me cuz my friends called her ****.
So my boyfriend is constantly txting me every minute of everyday. he's not demanding to know every little thing but he's becoming really clingy with it. what should i do???
in school people always talk about me behind my back and i dont think they really realize how much it hurts me inside. because i feel like they are actually judging me before they get to know the real me. i dont know what to do.
i care way to much about popularity. i try so hard to be perfect, and everyone says i am. i act really preppy and confident around everyone but inside im sad and i have no confidence. no one knows the real me. i dont even know the real me.
Well, my boyfriend treats me like a hostage. I CAN NOT do ANYTHING (hang out with friends, talk to friends, etc.) without him thinking I'm cheating on him. Basically, I have no social life. Pretty much I feel like I don't have a life at all. Ugh.
I've been dating my boyfriend for almost 2 years now and he wants a picture. I keep telling him i will, but I don't want to because of what happend with my friends. He tells me he loves me all the time, and I don't want to lose him. Hellp!! D:
Ohkay. So i have had this friend for like 8 years and we've been best friends forever. So she gets a boyfriend and then just stops talking to me. So i started hanging out with my other friend and she starts all this crap bout my other friend!PLZ HELP
People at school look at me different from everyone else because im small.i was born 4lbs and very sick/the doctor told my mom thti wasnt gn make it cause i wasnt fully developed.it hurts wen ppl tlk about me&wish i was treated like a normal person.
"Just to others; I had a relationship and I was being totally sufficated. He never stopped texting me. Telling me things I wanted to hear and all... He didn't want sex but he wanted my life. I had to give him up and to most, you should too... Slimebal"
would people judge me if i had sex at 15??
"I have my friend who I truly care alot about but I regret that me and her ex-boyfriend had relations while they were going through a ""rough patch."" If I could take it back I definitely would. "
" i invited this boy to my house oneday & he was forceing me to have ( it )with him & itold to get out my house & He did , & eht was the end of the year but the next year he was awkard i still Felt something for him aloot & He just ignore me "" / "
I walk around like i don't care what people think&say about me. I like the clothes i wear, i do&say whatever i want. But it hurts me when people judge me about that sora thing. I hate it. So i try not to do it to others because i know how it feels.
A few months ago my best friend broke up with his girlfriend who I thought was a good friend of mine...until my best friends told me that she was talking about me behind my back. Sadly I wrote really mean things about her on FB and myspace after that

this boy is completely obsessed with me & he kept smacking my butt & things like that. i am totally uncomfortable with him & i am kinda mean to him sometimes because he never gives up. then he complains to my friends that im being mean. ***
A year ago, I was involved with this guy who used me just for pleasure. I never had sex with him. His girlfriend now hates me and we used to be pretty good friends. She's harassed me, embarassed me and talks crap constantly - I don't know what to do.
I have been with my boyfriend for the past three years. He's my first everything. But he treats me pretty bad. He's cheated, more than once. He calls me names. But i'm still with him. I don't have the confidence to leave him. 
i am going into the 9th grade and i am very popular at school. im with the cool croud but im not like them i hate drama and when they talk mean about someone i dont say anything i just play along because i dont want people to hate me
I get called a slut everyday of my life. And it's because me and my boyfriend were dating for about a year, and everyone knew he was with me for just sex, and I was giving it to him. I was just to dumb to see that's why he was with me...
My boyfriend cheated on me after the girl told him I said a bunch of bad things about him, which I never said, and I got practically the whole school calling her slutface... revenge felt amazing... but was it over the line?
Me and my mom always fight my family gets mad when i dont tell her i love her i use to love her but thangs have gotten so bad i just dont love her no more. At school i am hated for no reason at all and teased.so i put a smile on and walk away in hurt
im dating this guy who is all over me and never gives me space but im in love with my ex i feel stupid because he treated me so bad and it was long distance on top of that he has a gf that he never told me about i want to move on but its hard 
"I feel like idk who i am I feel like i have to fit in with whoever i'm talking to Half of my grade thinks i'm ""weird' and the other half thinks im the smart pretty girl that isnt into guys But i wish everyone could learn about eachother on the inside"
I mean at school I just eat lunch by myself people call me different I want to be normal but I'm not I have ADD im slower then most people I just wish that people can see through my eyes. I dont have any friends hardly..I hate being alone
i'm in love with one of my friends shes a girl and so am i.i hate that i have to keep it a secret cause she has a bf and is straight.it kills me to know i'll never be with her
my bestfriend made another friend who exposed her to sex..nd she keeps setting me up with guyz who r expecting me to put out..i keep telling her that im not reddi, but idk....im going to highschool this year nd im confused....wat should i do?
my best friend(14) says that guys want one thing then once they get it they dont want u..so she decided that why not give them wat they want and get wat u want in the process? i have watched her go thru so much nd im very concerned..wat should i do??
I have divorced paretns, and I live with my mom for the most part, but I love seeing my dad. I hate it when they argue and at one point the only person I felt I could relieve my stress & pain was my gramps. He passed away and they don't notice that..
I act like I dnt care that ppl think Im a ****. I walk around with my chin up like the things ppl say bounce off like flies But really, it hurts. It hurts being called fat when Im not even overweight & being called a **** for saying what I feel. 
I feel like i am a terrible person. I once threaten someone without thinking. That person started to cry and i felt terrible. I pledge myself to stop bullying. I think is better to think before you write or say words. I feel terrible for what i did.
"Okay, i was blessed with really big boobs and a bunch of other girls are ""jealous"" and they started some rude rumors about me that i sleep around and etc. I finally got tired of it and changed schools and now my parents want me to go back. Help?"
Me and my best friend barely talk anymore and it's all over a BOY that we dont even like anymore .. I really wish we could talk more and i dont even think we are stil best friends should i ask her or just leave it alone ? PLEASE HELP !

All my friends are having sex with a bunch of different guys to feel good about theirselves.should i follow? or should i stop them? my bf ask for it all the time and i tell him no and he respects me.our school is about pot and sex. i wanna help. 
"Everyday is like a challenge to me. Everyone hates me because i speak my mind. One day I got up to go recieve a award for principals on a roll. And i heard someone yell ""eww"" when my name was called. It hurt my feelings that i get called that. "
I have a bf. He lost his virginity to me and we're both eachother's longest relationship. I've cheated on him a couple times n never told him. the day before our aniversary he got drunk and had sex. he told me and he regrets it. should i forgive him?
Last year my bestfriend started smoking. I wouldnt have been much of a friend if i didnt tell her to stop. her other friends didnt care. Whenever I tried telling her to stop her friends would make fun of me and yell at me to the point where i cried.
ok, so i ask my so called bestie if she wats to hang and she does txt me bac say yes or no and then i see she goin to hang these other 2 girls the same day i ask for us 2 to hang and i wrong to be mad a replace her cuz i may jst 4get her an not talk 
the kids at my school can be really mean. they crack jokes and make fun of me very often. when i get upset about it, they call me too sensitive. but its hard not getting upset when even the people who r supposed 2 b my frinds r mean 2 me!
Everyone talks about me behind my back, nobody has the courage to say it to my face. I don't start drama, but people try to start it with and about me. It hurts so much. I go to school with a fake smile trying to hide it but I only feel worse |: help
I've been talked about over my weight and people have made fun of me just because I have a few pounds on me and it makes me feel like an outcast of some of them and how if I go to the store and be embarrest about how big I look or how thick I am.
I dont have the guts to admit that matured  earlier than other girls' I started wearing a bra in 2nd grade and got my period in 4th grade when I was 10 years old and sometimes feel embarrest about it most of the time
I sometimes feel embarrest about telling  guys that I like then and sometimes if I like a guy they will find out by a group of gossiping ******* that like to start clonflict
"I am never thankful for what I've got or what my parents give me. I asked my mom for the new album from Drake , "" Thank Me Later"" but I just want to be a better  person this year for my parents."
I remeber a couple of years ago everyone was making fun of this girl and i was defending her then everyone started disliking me callin me the 'party pooper'. So just to fit in i started to join in on the teasing. Sense then i've changed 4 the better.
I never admited  that I tried to act sexual and explicit withmy body language  around other people that I act different around and later I wil regret doing it
Sometimes I just want to have sex and do things I normally wouldn't do because I'm so jealous of girls who do do things like that and I've noticed that they get attention and they're wanted by guys..... I just want someone to want me.
If you really knew me, you'd know that I get teased for being a virgin...&it hurts. I have low self esteem and I always want to fit in. I see every other girl and I get jealous because they're pretty. 
I thought I was in love with this kid who is almost 2 years older than me. and even after he broke my heart, i still would go back to him. We even had a thing going for over a month, and we fooled around at school a little in the locker rooms. bad?
Me and my husband are pretty young and trying to get use to married life. One night we had a pretty bad fight and he went downstairs on facebook. I logged on and read his message saying how he didn't know if he wanted to divorce me...
I dont like sending pics to guys but when they ask and i say no they stop talking to me so i end up sending them. im a horrible person
I've had countless guys text me for awhile then after about a week or so they ask for nudes. It gets hard to find a nice, decent guy who doesn't just think about sex. I'm still a virgin. Something like a nude picture would ruin everything in my life.
ive been with my boyfriend for 3 years and he never trusts me, without reason. and today he asked me if im having sex with other people out of no where i feel like he's trying to hide something now, does it seem like he's the one guilt of cheating?
A couple months ago i had a relationship with a guy 2 years older then me. we went over the line by doing a lot of sexual stuff.we broke up becasue he cheated on me & i did the same. I'm still confused, i still have feelings for him but he has a gf?
So, anyone heard of the site formspring? yeah, well i deleted mine, because people kept calling me fat and insulting me, anonymously. How are we suposed to stay awar from cyber bullying, when were given sites like that?
I had an ex-boyfriend that was cheating on me for 2 weeks and i didnt know it until he broke up with me well i told him that i almost cheated on him but i didnt. and he started callling me a ****! I dont get how im the ****.
Their was this guy that wanted me to send him a pic of me in my under~wear and i said no so he sent me a picture of his penis and he wanted a pic in re~turn but i wouldn't send him one & he stopped talking to me. What should i do?
i get teased all the time for being fat and ugly. But its not like im not trying to lose weight cuz i am! so one day i stood for my friend and this one girl started typing **** bout me and trashed me!  i was SO *******. but i dont know what to do
i cry becuz im sad. i cry becuz it makes me feel better .i cry becuz my mom calls me retarded. i cry becuz i feel like my mom should have had an abortion. im sad becuz i never felt like i fit in any where.
i recently broke up with mi ex, he is 16 n im 14. He keeps telling me he wants to have sex. My mum loves him, even tho she knows he smokes pot and such. she always wants me to be around him, he is a good friend, but its annoying..what do i do?
Okay. I was really into this guy, but, he had a girlfriend. He ended up breaking up with her, then we started getting more into each other. But he said he didn't wanna go out unless I sent him a naked picture. I did and now it could be everywhere. ):
i have been made fun of for how i look and i have been called fat and i have people tell me all the time im not fat or anything. and after my nana died i stopped eating  i lost a lot of weight. i am eating again but i dont know how to confront people
my best guy friend is so funnny and cute. i like him ALOT. i think he likes me but hes a perv like hes always talking about my boobs. my *** and sex. wha do i do? i like him so much but then this.
This guy I really liked him.We texted often.He asked if I would ever want to see  well you know. I caved in & sent him some pics.This was probably one of the worst mistakes ever.He never showed anyone. Be smart & don't do it. It ruins friendships.
My friend was having a problem with a girl hitting on her boyfriend so I thought I would step in an talk to this girl. The talk ended up in an arguement and I called her ugly, fat, a *****, and that I would fight her any day of the week. It was rude.
i recently rejected a girl who has been my friend for 8 years. i did feel bad, then i met this other girl. i told my friend there was nothing going on, even though i put we are dating on facebook. shes mad at me, am i wrong?
I had a friend named ***. Were still friends, we've been on and off since 6th grade. After a bad fight, she tells everybody that i don't shave, all the guys i first date have to ask. What she said isnt true though, its still hard meetin new people.
I constantly deal with mean commments from my grandma She will say things about  me all the time.The worst thing is that she constantly puts my mom down and talks about her infront of me So please tell me what I should do because ive had enough.
somedays i cry myself to sleep because i dont think my friends really care....
Somebody made a fake facebook of me saying mean things about me.. I just got it deleted so they could stop.
I met a boy at practice one day and we decided to hang out. We did some sexual things at my friends house but we don't even go out.  Is this okay? We didn't pass 2nd base but were very close to 3rd.
well the guy i was dating wonted a kid saturday and i told him no and im glade i didnt loose it to him.. and he broke up with me and he keep text me  and i dont wont to talk to him when i do talk to him he keep saying im no good at all 
i have always been known as the small gurl.And t hurs to say that i do cyber-bulling.I dont mean half of the thing i say.i just do it for a laugh.Whats wrong with me?I'm nice in person but mean online.Any advice for me?
I get made fun on my weight too much im not fat yet skinny to the bone. Im tired of it, my family even calls me fat and it makes me cry one of my guy friends said its impossible to carry you i cant take it anymore  idk why no one can expect me for me
I was jealous that I was losing a good guy friend of mine to my best friend Lizzie. So I said mean things about her to the guy. He took a screenshot of what I said and sent it to her. And she hasn't talked to me since.
"I think what most girls should realize is how hard it is for your friends when you discuss your weight or other's weights to them. If a friend is a few founds biggger or a lot they think ""well if she thinks she's fat ...What does she think of me?!"""
My cousin was saying racist things about my boyfriend and made fun of my brother who passed away, so I posted something really mean about her as my facebook status.  Was I wrong to do this, even though what she was saying was horrible?
i never show my true feelings and i let people talk ***** about me.. and i act like i dont care.. because i sometimes really dont care.. but sometimes i doo care. and i will go home and think about it..
i said mean things to people who are in other groups. even if she might hear, we both have shared taht we don't like eachother. instead of dealing with her face 2 face i just talk to others because she does. i don't know why we just don't talk it out
i had been teased by a group of girls for almost a year. they played on my phone,  called me names , they even told this other girl that i wanted to fight her over a guy that i no longer had an interest in. i overcame it, so can all of you.
My ex bestfriend and I made fun of a girl at our school singing on youtube. We posted  a comment on it sayinng how terrible she sounded and that she nedded lessons. We thought it was funny at the time but now i see that it was wrong.
I was at a party with friends, but my bf wasn't coming till later. We were in my friend's basement drinking and I ended up drinking way too much and cheated with a boy i just met. now me and that boy are in an on again/off again relationship.
My boyfriend had been cheating on me during my whole last school year. One of the girls I don't get along with in school sent me a picture of him with his privates exposed. I immediatly deleted it and the next few couple of days she was arrested 4 it
"I get called emo by nearly everyone i know. just cuz i swear a lot of black listen to metal rock and screamo. and i hate it. even my parents have called me emo. if someone is telling a story boutme n they dont know who they always say ""the emo kid"""
Iam a really nice person i have some friends but most of them make fun of me because i have pimples on my forehead! my brother even makes fun of me he always looks at my forehead in disgust i just want ppl to ignore my forehead and tlk to me 
Recently on facebook someone started a burn page. I wasn't mentioned specifically, but a relationship I had was posted as a status that no one should have known about. Only a couple of people knew about the relationship. Someone broke my trust.

Everyone calls me a*****or a **** just because I give my exs a second chance. Does that really make a ****or just curious if it will work out? I've only dated 3 guys only 1 was serious.
i was tesed for going out with this boy who isnt really somthing to look at, everyone thinks im a popular person who can do better. i fell for peer pressure and proved i likd him by hooking up with him. every one calls me names every since 
"My friend always calls me fat, but I am only 115 pounds and I'm ""5, 7"" , now I feel fat and I don't know what to do if I should tell her to stop or just let it go an dpretend it doesn't bug me"
I have NF, And because of te tumors, (1 is behind my eyelid.)Makes my eyelid swollen and look like a lazy eye.People used 2 torment me and made me feel like an alien I put up a defence than now has a bad impact on my life because I am quick 2 defend.
My friend claimed to love this guy. I liked him too. He had a fading girlfriend. I just let go of my boyfriend because he moved. I had sex with the guy, and he told everyone. I don't have my best friend because I tried to replace my one love, my ex.

I feel like the most worthless person in the world. no matter where i go i get the dirtiest looks and the rudest comments behind my back AND to my face. I have gott **** ***** **** and what not. People judge me by my looks and make me feel bad.......
"When i walk into a room, Full of people, They judge me almost immediately ""Oh look metal face"" ""**** shes fat"" ""What is that weirdo doing here?"" It makes me feel like nothing. My peircings BOOST my confidence and make me feel...sexier. What do i do?"

i read someone's story about excema- and i'm the exact same way, i also have dandrift and i'm ALWAYS getting teased cause of it by a group of guys. they're making my life horrible cause of it too
When i was in middle school i had a group of girl friends. one of them would always follow the rest of us, she couldnt be herself even though we liked her for who she was. so we wrote a note saying we didnt like her & to leave us alone, it was awful.
In 6th-8th grade i was mocked by all the guys in my grade. i was called a man everyday. i dont know why b/c i didnt act like a guy and i was quite developed. but it hurt & i've had self image issues since then. i wish they could know what they did.

I am helping my friend get through the rumors and lies that people are talking/spreading about him. hes a nice man, he doesnt deserve this at all! people are so ignorant and immature now a days just teasing everyone for no reason.
for three years now there has been a rumor about me from an ex boyfriend, and no one understands that when they mention it, it pushes my self esteem lower every single day. people think its funny but never know the reality that it has on a young girl

it kills me when i have a best friend that i never see, she seems to have time to see her other friends, but everytime i ask her if she wants to hang out she's always busy. it kills me when i go through everyday thinking everything is okay. is it?
I've been told numerous times over the internet that I'm fat, ugly, ect. I mean, i understand, i'm not fat, i know i'm not, im average for my age and height. but it still sticks to me, i feel uncomfortable with my whole appearence now.

"I have been dealing with depression since I started high school. My boyfriend of almost 3 years doesn't like to even talk about it. He has basically been the focus of my life, but I don't know if I""m the focus of his....what should I do?"
I hate myself. I've never had a boyfriend, I've never been kissed, I've never held hands. I feel like a disgrace sometimes and I wish these feelings would go away.  I don't know how to deal with them anymore. I'm a failure. An ugly failure. 
if you really knew me you would know that the smile on my face is just a mask to hide the pain, that the names  you call me really hurt me even though i act like it doesnt. and that i am depressed no matter how real the smile on my face seems.

One of my best friends is now dating my exboyfriend who broke my heart. We've been broken up for 3-4 months but shes now dating him. She didnt even tell me she liked him and she was there helping me after we broke up. She knows how destroyed i was.
Everyday I walk down the halls at my school (during the school year) and I hear hateful things said about me because of the guys I date. And none of my friends seem to help :(. Even when I'm surrounded by 'friend' I feel alone :( What should I do? :(
i send suggestive texts to guys cause it makes me feel wanted. I'm nothing like who i am when i text. I know its terrible but it makes me feel like someone wants me. I want to stop but the guy I like talks to me now and he wants it. What should I do?
"U'd think looking good with no blemishes in high school would be great, but the truth is that I get stories made up about me, putting on make up, ""daily face rituals"" and being told I dont need to try so hard to impress guys, I dont do any of these=("
im 22, I've been with my bf for a yr & a half now & i've caught him flirting on myspace & FB 4 times since we started dating, he always tells me he wont do it again, i love him but i just cant trust him anymore, what should i do?
My ex bfriend and I broke up but we still were having sex, going out, talking all the time but I didn't know that he was seeing some other chick also!!! I have to admit that I am still very much in love with the guy but I know I shouldn't talk to him
"I just recently broke up with a guy who was ""in love"" with me.Just after it happened I talked to him and he said that we'd be cool and friends. But he keeps trashing me online with his friends and being very immature. How do I get him to stop?"
"so me and this guy have a ""thing"" he's having a party next week. we arent going out. we went to washington with my school and he was all over me. we've never hung out. at his party he told my bff he wants to hook up with me. idk what 2 do!! plz help!"

if u really knew me u would know that almost everyone is my friend and almost everyone thinks im great but inside im probably the most insecure person and im very mean. i hate myself for this and sometimes i wonder if i deserve all the friends i have
"Im With A Guy, And He Always Plays Xbox Everyday And Very Night, I Live In America He Lives In Uk, He Never Says ""I Love u"" Anymore, He Never Talks 2 Me Anymore, Alot Of Ppl Say He Is Cheating On Me,..should i dump him? wht should i do?"
guys at my school try to talk to you because u have a nice body well i dont go for it because ive learned my lesson and it back fired on me... some girls that are pregnant at my school the guys and girls there they call them a ***** 
I've made stupid mistakes in my life that I'm not proud of. I've changed. I'm supper understanding and certainly NOT judgmental anymore, yet people look at my past & judge me for it. I get harrased because of it, it hurts..bad. When will they stop?
Awhile ago i told my friend some stuff about my friends.I told her that stuff becasue i tought i could trust her.Then my friends got her to tell her the things i said about them.So now they are mad at me.I feel upset,alone and betrayed:(Any advise?
i walk down the halls of my school alone and i feel like a loser. I feel so self concious about my self and my self confidence gets ruined
So my last boyfriend would always text me 24/7 & even if I would just reply w/ a yupp or ok he still would tet. &I he txted me when I was hanging with my bff kyle and when I didnt reply right away he would either resend or ask wht we were doing. :/
Digital Drama can really hurt people. I have heard of countless cases of kids and teens committing suicide over cyber bullying. Digital Drama is a huge problem in society today. It's best to keep things to yourself if they can't be said in person.

I constently get judged because i hunt and play sports...... I get called a boy, lez, tom boy, ect. It really hurts my self asteem........
I put on a smile everyday so nobody worries about how I feel I make other people feel better even if I cant keep myself happy I feel alone but have many friends I care for others more than myself but no matter what people make fun of me&treat me bad.
my best friend is bi an atheist does drugs drinks & steals, but he knows me better than anyone one else on this earth, im christian & I dont care.. my family thinks im going to hell for knowing him, I love him more than ive ever loved them.

Basically, I talk about doing everything and anything with these two guys (one only a while ago and the other, it's been for 4 years) and I'm not sure how I feel about myself, and it's all just confusing. Oh yeah, the 4 year guy always has a gf. :/
In 7th grade i recieved a message on myspace saying that i was going to be killed. At the time i was dealing with the death of my grandfather, discovered i had lyme disease and had to stop what i loved the most, ice skating. I will never foget it.
I get teased sooo much at school and bashed against and last year i got assaulted at school by someone ive never met because of drama. im ready to give up and just switch schools
"I post videos of myself singing on YouTube.  I got a comment on a video from someone I didn't know saying things like ""You have the worst *** voice I've ever heard."" and ""You should never sing again. You *** suck."" I tried to let it go."
Back in May the drama club put on a show during school. All the students cheered as the other cast members took their places on stage. When i went on everyone booed. My character died in the play... Only then they cheered.
My friend and I were texting and she flipped out on me because im upset that i have depression. Then she asked me why I was even talking to her. She made me cry. :(
Ok So.I went out with this boy Who doesnt go to my school.His girlfriend goes to my school and we find out that way go out with the same person .since that day we are enemys.She waits for me in the hallways,When we get out of school.Switching classes
i qo out with this boy well i dont think so anymore.But we havent talked for about 2 weeks. hes been acting shady couple days before we stop talking he told me he hasnt had sex for about 3 months since he been with me.is that why is he cheating on me
I love my boyfriend and I feel like we are in the long haul, towards engagement. But he always asks for a nude pic. even when I tell him I will never send one. He doesn't say it constantly, but when he does...he should know my answer wont change. 
Two girls are bullying me and my 'friend' who is also best friends with them, got into a fight with me so were not speaking. So all three girls are bullying me and I don't want to try out for soccer because there on the team. I dont know what to do.
I think I like this guy who is so adorable. I drop hints but he doesnt seem to get it. He will just think Im acting spazzy. He tells me to get a grip of my self and then makes me feel stupid.
so some one was being jelouse i had a girl friend and it wasnt them so to harrass me and her she took pics of me hugging girls like random girls will hug me and i found our later it was all just to make this girl cry and go into depression
I've been talking dirty with guys since i was 12, whether it be on an onlie chat room or sexting. I usualy only do it to people i trust or that i  don't know at all. I just love the sensation.
okay, so i weigh 110 and i'm 13 years old and i feel like i'm way over weight. should i stop eating for a while or whattt? I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT. ):
My dad and i have never been that close. One day i find out that he was leaving for a week and he didn't tell me. He wasn't going to tell me either about leaving for two months to go to some country on a 'buisness trip'. 
my bf and i have been dating 4 a while n i love him 2 death n think hes the 1 n he has really bad anger issues n he always goes MIA in  a conversation.. it really hurts when he does something like this. n if i try and talk bout it he gets mad at me.
This guy I am with does not want to commit into a relationship, but he wants to do sexual things with me.  I really want a relationship with him but he does not.  He is also the only one who accepts me for who I am.
Before I was ten I had lost both grandfathers I had and a grandma. I've lost five close friends and family members to cancer and other life-treating diseases. All I have left are my parents and my sister who doesn't have time. Basically it's just me.
So, me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 4 months, we text all the time and IM whenever we get the chance. My boyfriend flips when I dont reply in 5-10 min, he thinks I'm not paying enough attention to him & I cant have guy BFF. Anyideas?
my bf sent pics to my 2 besties claiming he got them off the internet... i wanna trust him  but i dont think i can, i know he loves me to death and no doubt i love him too! we have been together since 2nd grade! and i just dont know:/
I'm the type of person that likes to mess with people, but not in a mean way, just joking. So when my cousin gives me her friend's number and tells me to mess with him, I do. Afterwards, I tell him it was a joke, but now he wont stop contacting me!
A guy had a crush on me for 4 years now. He befriended my long distance bf on facebook and talked to him about me romantically? He got jealous and had lied to fb and got my bf's profile deleted and claimed to others he didn't exist (not true). 
"an ex boyfriend commented on a facebook picturepurposely trying to start drama by saying ""2 guys in one night? that's never happened before lol jk..."" and gets all of his buds to gang up on me. i don't answer the comments and my friends defend me"
I recently met this boy who is nineteen. I think im beginning to really like him but once again he is 19. Age dsnt matter to me but my friends keep telling me that all he is going to want is one thing. I dnt it though. should I go for it?
"Im datin an oldr guy and he treats me so right its incrdible; i swear im in love from wat i understand of it but the thing that frustrates me is he doens't want any1 2 kno bout us but he is ready to get sexual. i want him happy but i wanna b happy 2"
I sent this guy a picture of me naked awhile ago. my parents found out. but i still really like him. would it be bad for me to start anything sexual with him even tho i know its wrong but i seems ok
Im 13 turning 14 in december nd this guy who well were not dating yet but we are going to is 14 turning 15 in a couple of days. i really really like him alot nd hes already lost his virginity but i wanna give my first time to him. is it a bad thing??
i on the last day of school i found out that my to bffs were going out. they never told me bc i liked him. we got into a huge fight and he called me every name there is. told me i was flat chested and then said he was jk-ing. yah right.
a guy i was really wasnt friends with got my # he started sexting me and wanted pics i said no and the nxt day at school.... every thought i did stuff with him. idk what to do.
i rly like this guy and one night when we hung out we kissed and stuff and while we watched a movie with his parents in the room he was touching me under the covers, it gaveme a rush. is it okay to do this even though we're just talking and not datin
I've liked this guy for 3 years and now he just told me he thinks I'm hot and wants to hook up. I said yes. He wants a pic of me in a cami and booty shorts also. What do you all think about this?
I cheated on my boyfriend awhile back with my ex-boyfriend (also my best friend), and my boyfriend is upset I talk to my best friend and keeps pressuring me to stop talking to him. Is it too much?
me myi sis...n myi cuzzin lyked dhiz boy n he tongue kissd myi cuzzin kissd myi sis on tha cheek....&& wnt out widd me and tongue kissed me.....man now i feel used and dumb...so nxt tyme i c'm imma eitha kick his **** or imma play his wretched ****
my best friend liked this guy and she gave him her number buht he flirts widd me.....&& he dnt lyke her and he called her short and FAT!! Am i a good friend iff i continue t2 let him flirt widd me??
if you really knew youd know that eventhough people say im pretty.. due to one guy i feel different now.. i want to dye my hair, cut it and get color contacts hoping i can get pretty.. i dont feel good enough for anyone and guys want to do sexting :(
If you really knew me, you woul dknow that for a guy i though he was my everythin, fooled me and me innocently gave my virginity to him. After he left me,because he was still in love with his ex He is21.Yet i was still in high school...REALLY SAD.:'(
 groups in my school cool preppy wanna be lame nerd and just plain ewww in my school.all made up by the preppys thay rule the school just because i was new thay started a rumer that my parents smoke crack but they dont that made my life living HELL:(
if  u really knew me u would know that i went thourgh a bad time in my  life and i lost all the people tht were close to me and ever one left me and no longer wnted meee 
I'vebeen seeing this guy for about two years and I love him and I know he lovesd me . He keeps talking to me about having sex . Were both virgins and were 16.He said i have to lose it sooner or later and i want to lose it to you . Im so confused .
i play online games where there r some men who will say ur hot and other innapropriate things, and some even ask for my # or if they can meet me somewhere when i dont even knw them. of course i say no to everything, but i just dont understand them
"my friend has dis cousin who has a huge crush on me one day in class wen my teacher ""went out 2 get mor textbooks"" he went up in front of the whole class and read like a book of his fantasies about me my friend says i shud b glad he cares so much but"
Have you ever felt so alone..? Like everyone in the world only knew you as nothing. Well I have. It's hard. Having so many people say things about you, knowing it's not true..It kills you inside.. But you have to find the strength to move on..ryt? /:
my 7th grade year was drama full.my best friend moved school because there was so much drama.i was left alone with no friends there was a group of girls that were my ex best friends that made my 7th grade year suck and made everyone hate me by rumors
recently told this guy I've been seeing all summer that I don't want to do anything sexual with him.  I've kissed him, but he wants me to do way more.  he's started ignoring me and won't really talk if I text him.  guess that shows what he wanted.
Girls cause so much drama. This one girl who used to be my friend now tries to get other people to make fun of me. This just turns people against her and I try to explain it to her but she just says worse.
i am now datinq a boy whom i have been talkin 2 since apr of last yr. june of last yr, we found out tht his older bro & my mom have also been tlkin but not longer thn us. now they r gettin married in the next yr. but me & my boyfriend r n love. help?

i have to see a guy i had sex with every day.... its so awkward and i regret it so much! he acted liek nothing happend after...like it was nothing... it really hurts....=/ and i see him wioth his gf always and it hurts:(
my boyfriend cheated on me about 2 months ago. I made him delete all the girls numbers in his fone but i recently went through his old fone and those girls numbers are still in there. I honestly dont think he'd cheat again. But you never know. ?
 i dated this one guy, that i'm completely in love with but his ex girlfriend hates me because i dated him. And shes turning everyone against me at my school, and almost everyone hates me now because shes spreading lies. im losing all of my friends
"I have had someone send out a chain text message, about my ""personal"" life. I found out even people who thought were my friends were forwarding it. It really hurts to see that happen."
i feel that everyone in my house hates me. my mom and her bf always fight sometimes bout me. it hurts me My mom does drug.  take care of my little brother that is 9. its hard and i really dont know what to do i need help before i do sumthing crazy
I'm still in love with a guy I haven't seen in almost a year. He got deported and Ive been heartbroken and stupid ever since. I really want him to come back here legal or not . I just turned 21 and I've picked up drinking again to cope with it.

If you really knew me, you would know that my mom doesn't love me, I don't have a dad, and my whole life I have fought depression and O.C.D. How do I handle the outside world and all the crap I get for my disorder?
This girl accused me of calling her a ****, and I never did. She turned all her friends against me, including my friends. She used to be my best friend. Then she accused me of stealing her boyfriend which I never did and started more drama. It sucked
this girl emailed me saying she hated me and that i should die. i told my friend and i said not 2 tell any1. she went and told a guy she liked about it and it turns out he new the girl that told me to die and she laughed and said i was over reacting!
Hi I'm ***, i sent a picture to my boyfriend and i'm worried i'm going to have to register as a sex offender if someone finds out. i'm so scared.
i have this boyfriend, and he loves me alot? but he pressure's me into having sex all the time, i mean we have did it, but i feel i should wait untill marriage and i shouldn't be doing that?? what should i tell him?
If u really knew me, youd know im always depressed and i think i have bipolar disorder. Youd also know my parents dont believe me and wont help. What should i do?
One of my good friends broke up with her boyfriend a month ago because he was pressuring her to have sex. Now he's hitting on me, and telling me horrible things about her hoping I'll spread it around school. Thank heavens for good friends.
I text my girlfriend alllll the time and i never text anyone else or she'll get mad. we've been together for a long time and i really like her but she checks my facebook recent history and knows everything i do, it gets old.
MY BOYFRIEND ALWAYS check my phone and he takes it without my permission

"Ive had it rough. I have the reputation of ""That Girl"" and it totally sucks. I get ***** for it every day if my life. And to top it all off the whole highschools seen me nude thanks to two different guys who sent my picture to everyone.. wat do i do?"
This girl was constantly dissing me online, her statues was always something to do with me. it was all so rediculous I defriended her and told her the next time my name is in her mouth that the internet is not her place to do it. 
"I made a fake myspace once, and messed around w/ ppl. but it got out of hand when ""she"" was sexting other boys and they wanted to meet her. never again well i do that. "
Im super tiny for my age and everyone makes fun of me for it They act like its okay to do and I have zero selfesteem because of it Somedays I dont want to leave the house I hate my body and the way I look but nobody takes me seriously enough to stop.
I lie to make people like me and feel sorry for me. I know its wrong and I am stoping and appologizing to every one.
A girl started w/ me saying she'd knock the taste out of my mouth. I told my mom and she said it was a joke because that's impossible. 2 days later, she accidentally hit me and keeps lying saying she meant it just to look cool
My bf saw a girl hit me and said he'd protect me. For a while, he did and I loved him. Recently, he has his gang protecting me and nobody wants to be around me anymore, I don't wanna tell him off, becuz I'm afraid I'll lose him.
this guy used to be my friend and we used to be best friends,now we never talk anymore,he is having sex,drinking alcohol and smoking weed.Please help I don't know what to do.

I've had a problem with sending naked pictures to people and now I want to stop but am finding it hard to with all the pressure.  I want to find a good guy for a relationship, any suggextions on how to stop?
I can get a guy to want me, & hook up with me, but i cant get a guy to stay. i'm tired of everyone saying i'm too pretty to have a boyfriend, i just want to feel needed. i need affection..
I have an order of protection on someone who is continuously violating it through a facebook  profile impersonating me.This has been going on for three months and nothing has been done.  They have been reported several times and nothing has been done
if you really knew me you would know that i don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm constantly figgeting or trying to make myself look good.my life is always going down hill. i have no self esteem and i am constantly trying to fit it.
i really like this guy in my history class, but he never talks to me. I've been camping his facebook page, is that ok?
My best friend was breaks up me and my boy friend then she goes and asks him out and she like on he will cheat on you and stuff like that. its stupid how she does that she does that with alll the guys i dated.
so this guy calls me baby and flirts alot with me, he always says im beautiful and stuff like that so i started liking him, my friend talks to him and he says he doesnt like anyone hes not ready but he asked me to have sex with him.. what should i do
I feel really ugly, and noone in my class likes me and they all think I'm annoying and I have ADHD so I am kind of annoying but I feel that everyone hates me.
Ive been best friends with this dude for about a year until he started liking me but i didnt lik him in that way. We ended up fighting for a few months and i eventually just told him i dont wanna talk anymore now he calls me a ****** all the time
Ok so i sent a pic o my boobs to my boyfriend do u think i can trust him to keep it a secret or wat shld i do
"i dont get why people think ""rules"" are controlling. a relationship should be about you and your partner. theres no need for the girl to talk to/chill w guys or the guy to talk/chill with girls whether its phone, comp, or in person. love is sacrifice"
if your gf/bf cheated on you and you stayed to prove what love is and that its committment and sacrifice isnt it ok for you to have each other delete pointless sites and have them delete the other sexs numbers? it should only be about the 2 of you...
Okay so there is this boy i dated him for 9 months off & on. He always told me he loved me then a month & a half ago we broke up and no he is with another girl but yet he still says he loves me. Do i move on or what should i do? Helpp !!! Please
if your gf/bf cheated on you and you wanna make it work and be in love the right way, isnt it ok if you agree to have each others info and have each other delete pointless sites and the opposite sex's numbers....? its supposed to be god, family, us.

Growing Up Gay Was Hard For Me I got bullied, Rocks Thrown at me, and got told alot of Horrible Things. When I noticed that I didn't like girls as girlfriends and saw them as just friends I knew that I was born this way. 
My girlfriends accepts the fact that I am gay and everything I do. But they don't feel the same about lesbians, infact they're really grossed out by them. Personally, I am offended, because they are my people, and I dont agree with ANY discrimination
I was in hollywood at the ihop at around 2:30 am this group of guys called me hideous and fat as I walked by their table, they did this about 8 times until I told them all to die and burn in hell, I feel bad but they made me feel worse

"I stood there and listend to them joke about ""the gays"" and whether they could catch it...and what they would do to themselves to keep that from happening.  One guy said he'd jump off a bridge.  Needless to say, I didn't come out for a long time."
People in school raggin on my religion. I am proud of what i believe. Putting a cross on my locker that says jesus freak? Over?
The worst digital drama I have ever had was a few months ago. I was at home and my ex texted me and said that I was worthless and how he never loved me and wished that we had never met. 
My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months now and we are in love. But when we get into fights he turns cruel. Last night he even said he should've just left me after we had sex. He always feels ashamed after his temper cools, but it hurts. 
I was dating this guy, we broke up but I wasn't over him then one day him and my friend were talking about pills and he didn't know what vikoden or hyrocodone was and I did so he started calling me a pill popper and now everyone else is too

I had a girl that for some reason,thought that I was spreading rumors that she was having sex, she than went onto her facebook page to rant about me, thinking that I would not find out, I told the girl, and her parents, and the girl said I was lying,
"Two years ago, I was cyber bullied. People i didn't even know was saying ""your going to get pregnet"" ""wheres your condoms?"" it was horrable. And still to this day random people say stuff. I never really knew how much it hurt until then."
me and my old bff just started hangingThe reason why we stopprd is because she was to fast but now she has a 22 old boyfriend and shes only 13 like how can i talk to her without trying to control her life iwanna be a good friend and not have sex

People constantly talk bad about me...I try not to let it get to me but it's hard when they constantly call you a **** and a **** for no apparent reason..it just hurts really bad n they won't stop
I always assume my gf is cheating on me because she was always hanging out with this one guy and I couldn't be there. Once they even hung out till 1 a.m. It was uncomfortable for me, but when I talked to her she told me I was too controlling. Am I?
So there is this REALLY ugly chick in my class who everyone secretly hates, including me. She was my friend since last year but recently she's being a little stuck up *****. What should I do?

I sit in the corner of my math class with my friend, another boy and girl who hate our guts. Everyday they turn around and try to provoke argument to tell us how ****, stupid, and over obsessive we are. Were hated cause i rejected the guy.
I became friends with a guy who was depressed and suicidal. I helped him through a rough time. He asked me out, I said no. He seemed okay with that, and we continued as friends, until I found out that he was spreading lies and talking trash about me.

This group of popular kids, one of whom is my neighbor, and the son of my mothers good friend, decided to harass me over facebook, and partly in person...The boy would leave comments on my photos, and then his gf would laugh at me in school...
my ex-boyfriend broke up with me and I was **** so in response I made a fake screen name to get back at him. Through this person I became the girl I knew he would like I kept this going on for over 6 months until finally I just stopped logging on
you're with someone you love for 11 months and then on and off for a month. he keeps breaking up with me&changing his mind. he promised he wouldn't leave me and then he took my virginity after the year we've been together. then he left again.
"This girl at work would always make fun of me about being small framed. I am 5'1"" and she would always say things about how small my boobs were which I never really had a problem with but she has made me self conscious about it now. "
I really like this guy, and i thought he liked me before, but nothing happened, then he asked out my friend, and she said yes. then he broke up with her after 2 days cuz he was using her, then he told my other friend he loves her and there going out
My ex boy-friend dumped me then my best friend asked him out, and they both still want to be my friend, should I be there friend??? I kinda don't but I don't want to say that I don't want to be friends how should I till them?

a girl that i lov always calls me mean names and it hurts.and i dont think she even cares about me at all even tho she calls me her bestfriend and she flirts with me she goes and dates sum other guy.when she says she likes me and she knows i lov her
I'm not taken seriously. I have friends that hang out with these girls that like to mess around and pick on me.Whenever i say something to them,they say that they love me.Sometimes the endless blonde jokes hurt,and make me feel like i wanna be alone.
i have friend, actually not my bf. but he is so nice to me. and he said love me every time we chat. actually we are not in relationship. but i love him too. then we never meet before :'(
Ive known a friend of mine for 4 years. i gave him my virginity and he wants to date. i like someone else. Was that a mistake to do that if i know im not interested in him? 
There's this guy at my old school that started asking me to send him nude pictures of myself. Of course I refused, but whenever I would refuse, he would stop talking. Even though he's my ex now, he's still asking me to send them....

During my first year in college someone trashed me via the Honesty Box application on Facebook. There are only 2 or 3 people who could have done it, and I talked to them every day. Yet none of them had the guts to tell me how they really felt.
I was just recently pressured into trying drugs. Dont. Ever. Try it. I only did it once, and every time i see somebody who has a way into getting the stuff he/she needs i have an urge to do it. Also my friend got bullied and i was bullied to help.:(

"my Gf said she loved me and never would love someone else. but anyways, she texted me saying ""i dont love you and never did"" then the next morning she texted ""i only said i loved you to make you happy. then the next day she went out with someone else"
So my friend's boyfriend keeps harrassing me and recently told me Im a ***** creep and that she hates me. Now she told me that her boyfriend is just being a douche, but I dont believe her. at the same time shes been so nice to me.Shoud I trust her?
So I dated this girl for 4 months then we broke up. 2 days later my friend told me that the reason my ex wanted to break up was cause she cheated on me with another girl. She always brags that she is with that girl but says she doesn't like her.
When i went out with a guy his x-girlfriend would spread rumors about me saying i was a ***** and that i was cheting and then everybody hated me 
So I have a younger sister and she's 14...and very gorgeous. It can be a good thing but the guy I like text me asking me if it was okay if he hooked up with my sister, I know I'm not the prettiest but being compared to her and when he did that hurt..
I broke up with my gf a month ago. My best friend told me the reason she wanted to break up with me was cause she was cheating on me with another girl. I sit near my ex and she ALWAYS talks about the girl she cheated on me which annoys me so much.

My bff hated my bf and she kept telling to me to brake up with him but i liked him. he eventually broke up with me a few weeks after he did he asked my bff out and ever since they have been dating. but i thought she hated him?
Me & My Ex Were Together For A Month. When We Broke Up I Was Crushed! And A Year Later We Were Still Really Good Friends & He noticed I Still Liked Him ALOT! So He Told Me To Send Him Nude Pictures I Of Course Said No But He Still Insists To This Day
A friend of mine posted a random fb status & my other friend decided to coment on it and she was ganging up on her so i decided to stick up for her & then the other girl wanted to fight me cause i stuck up for the one that was getting ganged up on
i met this guy on the internet and we talked for almost a year before things got seriouse. Then when we decided to move to the next level i went to go see him he lives in another state... I went on my own.. My family thinks that was wrong was it??
I had an ex who wouldnt leave me alone, No matter what i did. Harassed me over the phone, emails, facebook & even my blog website. So after years of taking it, I finally decided to contact her parents and get it settled. We are now good friends :) 
I had many friends online, until they turned on me because of one person telling them lies. Then i started having people hack me and telling me to kill myself. I hide my identity online just so people won't come to me again with everything. 
My friend developed feelings for me. I told him I don't feel the same way and we just need to stay friends, but he won't stop messaging me and texting me telling me that we should be together. It doesn't matter what I do, he won't stop.
I was talking in fb with one boy,and when he knew that I admire JB,he started to talk bad things about he,n normaly I defend JB,so he started to abuse me with bad words,n he told me that is goin'g to hack my fb,but I set my msn private and now its ok
someone hacked my profile and posted hurtful stuff to somebody my grandma knows and she thought it was me so i called her and she still believed i did it. i had to stop it so i changed my password.
2day we were playing telephone at lunch and it came out as i like doing dogs..... it spread around and now its a rumor :O
i had to block my father from my fb because he was talking the wrong way on my page & i dont want kids 2 read that stuff
had 2 block my sisters on fb because how they were talking about me & my wife
i would get messages from strangers on myspace all the time, idk if maybe they knew my hubby or brother so i would open it & there would be some nasty graphic words in them. i spammed them
"On Facebook, I see many individuals posting things that would often be embarrasing to talk about in person. For ex, a male posting they want to go see Justins' Movie, Never Say Never. Commenting this post many say, ""Gay."" Should one Defend? Why?"
i have been married for 10 yrs this yr & my husband had a kid w a girl he knocked up by mistake, he never loved her but anyway she or some1 she knows sent me naked pics of her  2 my cell. i deleted them instantly & just makes me feel sick 
I am still in love with my ex, who I broke up with and now he has a new gf. One night he asked me to sendhim some naked picture, i did because I love him even though he has a gf. It has going on for a while now and I feel really guilty.

This started on facebook when i was commenting on my best friends picture i was just playing around, but her other friend jumped in and she was saying all this bad things about me and this happened many times when ppl say bad things about me to....
Yahoo: i was tlking to my best friend and this girl got on and was tlking to me and then she said add someone and so i did and she got on there cussin me out over a boy that her best friend was datin and then he broke up with her an asked me out.
I went up my best friends house and i was up there til like 7:00 then i went home and the next day she sent me a video of her naked and she said do u like i just got out of the shower and i replyed H*** NO and i deleted it imediately!
"i was texting a guy and he asked me to send a naked picture. i told that i wasnt going to but he kept asking and said ""you know i'll delete it after."" i still didnt send it cause i didnt know for sure if he wouldnt send it or show i to someone."
I am dating this 22 year old and he has had his share of girls in the past..he not pressuring me yet..but he is getting there. Should i stay with him or just move on to someone who wantss the same thing as me?
So I had liked this one girl for 2 years and she used me and got mad at me all the time. She transfered schools and I started to dog her out on text messages and calling her names
some jerk from my school is going on facebook and telling rumors about other people from the school. its been a week and we still havent found out who it was. and my friend told me this kinda thing happened last year too. smh.
a special needs kid at my school said hi to a girl at my table & the girl just rolled her eyes & said something rude about him.So me & my friend told her the least she can do is say hi,she gave us a dirty look & me & my friend went to talk to the kid
There was this kid in the 7th grade, my friend's friend said he liked me. So, i was thinking about it, i gave my friend a note to give to that kid. The Douche thinks he is all cool-reads it out loud, & i got a note from him saying im a whale, & ****
this is my first year at my high school, & i met this one girl. She was nice, funny, and stuff but the things i would hear about her was that she took a pic of herself in a thong. are you kidding me, IM STILL DISAPOINTED!
My girl friend wants to have sex with me. I dont want to because I think I'm to young and not ready. She just thinks it's because she's not good enough and she gets mad at me
"I've never had a boyfriend before. And I know it's because they think I'm ugly. I think i look okay, but I'm not sure anymore. I've never been asked out and I'm 17 for crying out loud! I really want to experience ""love"" firsthand. :("
I had a friend. This one time she got a boyfriend. She texted my other friend saying not to talk to her boyfriend ever again cause she was jealous. It was really hard because the one being threatened wasn't even that good of friends with her.
My friend was reallly cool until she gave my phone number out to this random guy at school. now he texts me all the time and calls me. It's awful!
There is this girl at my school who I used to be best friends with but then last Friday we were sending each other texts making fun of each other as a joke. But then suddenly she went you don't get it. I really hate you, you used me to get popular.  
i have a boyfriend and i really like him but in class one day i heard him talkin to his friend and he said that he regrets breaking up with his ex and how shes really hot. what should i do?
I've witnessed a girl get bullied and it's not good. It's really hurtful. People have no feelings or a heart now a days. Everyone should be kind to everyone no matter what.
i'm hookin up with ex-boyfriends bestfriend. I don't even like the kid, but its making my ex-bf real jealous. Now his bestfriend wants to start a relationship with me. Would it be over the line... to date someone just to make somone else jealous? 
"My ""friends"" are always Criticizing me no matter what I pooted the other day on accident and my friend went and told my bf right after I told her not to. Are they really friends?"
"My facebook page has been badly hacked because I forgot to log out, and after confronting the person and asking why they would publicly humiliate me, they said, ""I was just joking, it could have been worse."" SPEAK UP and prevent online bullying!"
i been with this guy seen august he fianlly meet my best friend and he has her number n he wont stp txtin her and she dnt reply to him the only thing he ask her is like wats up have u talk to ur friend stuff like that and i dnt know wat to do 
There's this guy I like, who has a fullblown stalker. She calls him all the time 
Because i've lied so much my parents can't trust me. They accuse me of things i haven't done. I admit to doing it anyway because i don't want to fight about it anymore.
So me and my freinds prank phone call people alot. So one day at a party we looked up one of my teachers #s off some website. We called it and had a dandy time... But now I started looking for more #s should I call them or just stop?

Im planning on meeting up with a guy I met on the internet,he's1year older and lives1hour away. We've talked on the phone and so but something tells me I shouldn't do this, help?

So ppl make fun of me for things I can't control, I tell my mom and she tells me to just ignore it but it's hard idk what to do bc it hurts just so much any advice?!

Im on a vball team and there are 3 people who always say their the best and that wasnt their game when they did rlly well But they always say good job to everyone but me they always discourage and bring me down even at school & wats wrong im nice 2
I'm 17 and I drink which my bf hates and I talk to my ex even tho my bf asked me not to. I feel like a bad gf but I can't see myself stopping either of those things
I can't trust & honestly don't think I will ever be able to trust again.
I hate my parents ppl say I shouldn't but it's the truth I'm not going to lie I'm not like them my dad isn't really my dad but he hurts me and I don't know what I did to deserve the way I'm being treated what should I do!!!
"I was ""texting"" my ex's cousin, and he started sexting so figured I'd do it too. -Bad Idea... Anyway, He sent a nude picture of myself and excepted me to send one back, so I went on the internet and looked up ""naked brunette girls"" and used those."
Well, my story of me being bullied started in grade 3-4 of name calling. Then in grade 5 it gotten worse and worse everyday. And then grade 6, I wanted to pulled the cord off of my life. But I didn't, I told my mom and we moved. Words hurt.
Illegal Wiretapping...Currently Americans are being aressted for felony charges for posting videos of police misconduct and/or brutatlity. The law is the Patriot Act, and citizens need to step up, because there is no real privacy in public for anyone
i used to sext random guys but now i dont and now i think im a ****
So this guy made me fall for him a second time! Just to find out he was sending the same stuff to another girl and he lied to us both.  I balled for days but i still love him and he makes me happy, ( he is going through a phase):(   he dated the girl
"I feel like **** all the time; that im never good enough for a girl. I acutally never really had a gf, I just wanna feel loved, affectionate, and have that special someone. i feel like there is nothing for me,every girl i meet deserves better than me"
I'm 18 years old, I've never had a boyfriend. I'm fat. I feel like I have no worth. No one cares about me. I just want to feel loved. But it's understandable that no ones wants to. I'm just a disappointment in general. 
There's this guy I like and he likes me but my fellow colorguard member is forever touching on him and messing with him and when me and him are just together she has to bother us. She claims she doesn't like him AND SHE HAS A BF
Every time I walk into school people always find me and chase me down. They justa always be mean to me and Im a from China so they mock my lunches of rice and wok but they do not know that it is tasty
i would always go hook up with this guy who was my brothers best friend and now i actually like him but he has a girl friend and we still hook up every once in a while.
When I started HS, I told myself I wouldn't be influenced by people around me. But, now in my Sophomore I'm getting drunk every weekend, and I got to school high. And I'm starting to lose my friends. Do I stop and admit I have a problem or not stop?
I Love This Site.. Thank God For This Site
when i was in middle school i never cared what people thought but now that in in HS i really wonder if i will fit in and also im scared for the future and sometimes i feel like i wanna give up with trying to reach my dreams because there so far away!
i was sued and made an examplle of for my friend killing herself in a bullying ring at a school i didnt even go to. the news lied about everything and her parents blame a group of us girls. we didnt do it and it will follow me forever.

I had this boyfriend,i actually liked another guy at the time.There was party where i kissed another guy and my bf found out,it blew up into this big thing,in the end a girl i thought was my friend, put on twitter that i was a ***** and it hurt alot.
In middle school, I had no friends. Everyone in my grade hated me & picked on me for no reason. I only had 3 friends 7 only 1 went to school with me. She kept me alive, I never told her cause i was afraid. I'm in college now & it still affects me. 
My first friend that i made when i moved has really changed in the past 5 years. We used to hang out all the time and have alot of things in common. but now it's always 'let's get drunk' We end up fighting over it. What do i do?
I'm in middle school, and it's my eighth grade year, this guy's been hurting me lately. I broke up with him for this guy I'm with now that I'm happy with and really like. My ex has another girlfriend and says he still loves me. I cant take it !! 
11th grade i met a guy and fell for him, had sex with him and he said he liked me, well school ended and we stopped talking. this past summer we kissed and i felt sparks, he doesnt wanna be with me but i think i fell in love with him. what do i do?
Girls always tell me they are hooking up with my HUSBAND. The last time he got arrested, his mom told me he had been cheating on me our entire marriage, he told me she was lieing b/c she got mad at him. I took him back, but is he cheating or no?
My bfs brother accidently killed my best friend in a car accident. I got hell for being with him and was told I was a disgrace. I ignored it and now I am in love and will never forget my best friend. I love you *** and for all of you it gets better
I had a problem in 7th grade because I had a time where every day I would go home and hurt myself. This kept happening more and more. It finally escalated to the point where i wanted to end it actually. It effected my life, I'm glad I didn't listen.
I've been hooking up with this guy and I believe that he loves me. He's cute and has plump lips which I love. I have sex alot because I like ****, and, I cant stop. He makes me feel special but I think he's using me. I don't know what to do anymore. 
I think my girlfriend is using me for back massages and sex. And money. And entertainment.
Dad's a drug addict, moms.. Struggling. And now that I'm in high school, I'm a hypocrite. I experiment with drugs. With the family, I'm a homophobe.. In reality, I'm pansexual. I don't know what to do- I'm the two faced ***** I never wanted to be...
I have had an entire Facebook made up and designated to people that hate me..if they really do hate me...what should i do? confront them? fight back?
When i was 14 my ex bbf & i had a big fight she got so mad at me she created a hate page about me i didnt know what to until a week after my brother saw it and helped 
Last year, Formspring ruined my life. Was told everyday on there or outside/inside school to go kill myself by people I didn't know. I was put on suicide watch for a couple months. Help me get the rest of my story out there,I want to make this public
I was 14 & there was this boy I really thought liked me I told him a lot of personal stuff about me that no one knows. We were really close to, & then one day he asked me out & I told him no, so he hacked my fb and posted a lot of mean stuff..
Last night Someone made a fake fb profile about me and i cried over it thats how harsh it was Over the Line? what do I do ?
I knew a guy for a year and a half, we use to sext (Words only) talk on the phone and he claimed he loved me, I believed it. He was always so controlling though, And when I showed him a picture of me more nude, he still hasnt replied since that day.
I can't believe this. It's been 2 months and my mom has had NO money. none. since she didnt pay our electric bill, we had to sleep at my cousin's house. we keep eating left overs over and over again...and my goddamn dad wont give my mom any money.
"The past two weeks someone has been calling me mean names that aren't even true..now all my ""friends"" are saying the same thing..i don't know what to do because it was so sudden..guess this is the year to find all my real friends."
I added this guy on Facebook as a friend one day. When I went online , he messaged me. At first it was just friendly conversation, we just talked about regular everyday things. But he asked if we could meet up one day. I logged off and deleted him.
I was on this gaming website and people just started to say to me that i was a *****, a skank and other things.i got over it i let it go.
this girl online and in school started to spread rumors about me. It got to me ihad thoughts saying that no cared if i was in this world or i was just invisible.but one of my friends stepped and supported me thourgh it.now i know that people care.
Me and this guy have been fooling around but we arent dating...Although we did 4 months ago..Is this over the line? :/
Since my homelife isnt so good nor is my social life I have this overwhelming urge to be loved. I get so depressed when I finally get my self esteem up and then someone from school calls me ugly or w/e. Only 13 and I dont want to feel so damn old
am very knowed in my city,some of my ex bestfriend told my life to the whole city now everyone knows about my life and make fun of me . am always getting attected on facebook
i went away during the summer. and my boyfriend of a year and a half stayed back home. he went to the club and was caught cheating. now that im still away im having issues trusting him . i always ask where hes going and i tell my friends to watch him
I grinded -heavily- on this guy named *** at our schools dance, and it was my friends boyfriend but i was unaware at the time they were dating. Now everyone calls me a sl**, sk***, wh***, etc.. I dont know what to do anymoree! 
so this girl is always saying that she knows me because when when i was like 14 i used to go to the movie theater that she worked at im 19 and she 21... Im running out of room im going to post rest in another one
So I have fallin in love with my step brother...we have already kissed. Is that Over the line? 
I have a friend who always claims my statuses are about her.. (none of my statuses are bad nor about her).. She has texted me several times about how I am in the wrong and when I say they were never about her she has called me a liar.
I have always been bullied for the way I look and act but I don't know why everyone is hatin'. What did I ever do to them?
i work on a construction site and there is this one guy inpaticular that calls me hunny and sweetie. but not the way your grandmother would say. to get my attention he caresses some part on me (not in sexual places tho) ex shoulder, leg, knee, waste.
When I was a Freshman, I went out with the All-State Junior Hockey player and at Dinner he texted three other girls, and barely spoke to me. When he asked me out again the next week and I said no, he spread a rumor that we hooked up around school.
U always hav2b careful wat u send2 people exspecially pics over text or Skyping. I have a friend who works for communications he said that anytime you send pics online or on a phone that it's saved copied not once but many times! I wish I knw this b4
I was in 8th grade when this started.i really liked this guy. so ask him his birthday.then his friend said y are u stalkering him? i was mad and he just sat there and let him say that so i left the classroom and cried what should i do?
There's a girl who I onced had her back and was always in fights because of her. NOW we don't get along so she makes fake profiles to comment on my pics talking trash what can i do besides beating her up..

"Last year at school someone made a FB page listing all the ""****"" in the school. People were reading it and laughing but I thought it was over the line."

Beginning of high school my best friend  and i just werent friends and then her, her friends, and her family(her mom being the worst) started harrassing me by text ,at my practices, also spreading rumors ,and im not the only one they did it to!
I was talking to my ex-boyfriend today and I said i missed us being friends. He responded by saying I was a fake, ugly, a slut, and that I was a **** and brought us my fathers former drinking problem. I dont know what to do. Please help
One time last year, i started haning around some new people and they were good friends.But then my old bestfriend told them lies about me.They started too call me a slut,*****,and *****.It got worse and worse everyday.My old bestfriend and i fought. 
In high school, people I didn't even know would send me these awful hate messages calling me a **** and telling me that everyone at our high school hated me even though I was quite loved. I never figured out who they were even though it was reported.
i have this  crush on this boy at my church and i thought he liked me becase he would flirt with me all the time but now my cosin has started to come he has been flrting with her and being mean to me they even make jokes and lagh in my face... 
"I was texting my friend from 3rd block.and he told me that I was pretty and he wanted my number when I got on Facebook.Everything was good&stuff then he asked me for the""pic"" and I said no then he called me a *****.So I don't ever next him no more."
"I was texting this one guy who is a year older then me, he always flirts with me and says how badly he wants to ""get it in"" with me.. some of the things he texts me are honestly discousting and im afraid of what he will say so i just act that way too"
"I give people great parenting advice on my twitter feed and they call me a ""C-word"" and threaten my son sexually with peanuts."
I use dto talk to this guy and I told him I was older than I was but he was still 18 and he would always say like I want your ***** and stuff like that it made me really uncomfortable
October 17 is the day that me and my ex would have a year together.. He cheated on me, hurt me and did me soo wrong.. I can't hold back the tears knowing that on this day I'm going to be the only one still feeling the same love that I felt a year ago
well my name is *** and im in 8th grade i have been bullied all my life. i get wrote about in the bathroom stalls at school and no one really does anything about it im ready to take a stand for people that get bullied or wrote about or anything.
"I""m always the girl people come to  to lay all their problems on but what they don't realize is im dying inside too. I'm not perfect and I just want someone to talk to because im really tired of covering up all my sadness. Please help me. "
After two friends of mine broke up, the guy and I started texting. One thing led to another and before we knew it, we were sexting (dirty talk) each other for three days. They got back together and then she broke up with him. She still doesn't know.
I was bullied for 2 and a half years in middle school. I was so close to comitting suicide but God saved me. I am not ashamed, I am here to tell my story because I was given another chance to change this and make sure it never happens to anyone else.
There is this guy who I have been messing around with for a while and then stopped. I moved out of my moms place and we reconnected and he told me he loved me. I love him. I went though his phone and after seeing some text I feel like I cant trust p1
P2 Him because he texted someone sweetheart and he lied about other girls who come over to MY place to see him. I do a lot for him and most nights, but not all, he stays with me. I'm not one for games. I do to much to much for him to b advice?
Two years ago I was talk inappropriately to a guy, falling in his trap I guess you could say. My boyfriend found out and came out with it, me and the other guy didn't do anything sexual, or say anything sexual. He still holds it against me? What shou
When i was in middle school i was constantly bullied for my weight. if you or someone you know is being bullied, take a stand and defend them , it makes a difference ! It could save yours or someones life !
"In elementary school and middle school I was picked on for my birth mark on my arm. Its blochy red marks all over my arm. Kids used to say it was gross and even say ""ew whats that on your arm."" "
ME and my mom dont get along to well she calls me names like worthless sometimes i think she wants me out of her life!!!!!!!!
ive been off n on with this boy for 2 years. and hes perfect in every way atleast to me he is.but lately hes been callin me a whore because im with some1 else. he left me i didnt leave him. hes everything i wanted but i cant stand him hurtin me again
As a middle schooler, I was consantly teased due to my sexual orientation and my appearance, which drove me to the point of violent anger. I became a bully myself, but thanks to recent events in my life, I'm a difference person. Proud, accepting.
I really like this one girl who goes to my school, and there's this other girl that's just my friend. Everyone else saying I'm guy because I talk to guys that are guy or bi
I've always been a bigger girl and nobody ever really said anything to me about it until I got into the eighth grade. I'm currently a high school Junior and I've been deeling with prank calls about my weight from a girl who doesn't like me.
"In 5th grade I lost my bff to a rumor. I supposedly grabbed another persons body part which was a lie. Then it spread like a wild fire. My ""bff"" thot I was a weirdo n now we don't talk. Was she really a friend in the first place ???"
 I just always feel alone in this world. I have friends but I feel like no ones actually your friends. I always feel like its no need for me to be here because things that happens around me and my environment always gets me down. 
there is a boy @ my school and he's a bully to other people and whenever we call him on it and go to a teacher he just comes up witha lie to get out of it and the teachers believe him... what should we do??? no one wants that around anymore
My bf broke up with me bcuz I wouldn't  sent dirty texts to him. I and I think I want him back 
ima freshman and i get bullied by a girl in my grade and the thing is i never even talked to her . she just started hating me for some reason. and everything she does i always let it slide. like i will just pretend its alright but it isnt.
there was this girl at school I really liked. so I asked her for her number. texte
