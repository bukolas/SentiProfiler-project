Why am I banging on about EGGS all of a sudden on a Saturday night (oops...actually it's 4am in the morning in Hong Kong here...)?  Well, because I've had a bit of an EGG-citing whirlwind trip to Hong Kong where the first part of the trip was already mind bogglingly EGG-citing but the second part also matched that EGG-citing ness in equal measure.  So that's a lot of eggs...

But I promise there is a reason why EGGS are present in the post and hah, it is by no means round about and forced.  Ok maybe it is... oh well, here goes... Joyce aka the store which opened my eyes a little to Hong Kong's forward fashion acceptance last time I was there organised an even more eye-opening event to honour a special one-off project that Rodarte has taken part in.  The Mulleavy sisters have created four one-off outfits inspired by four characters played by Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love, Hero, The Heroic Trio, Clean) that were on exhibition at a bash thrown last night which accompanied a premiere of a short film directed by Wing Shya (most known for his graphic design and photography work on many Wong Kar Wai films...).  Rodarte.  In Hong Kong.  With Maggie Cheung.  Plenty of Wong Kar Wai connections/connotations.  Whats.NOT.to.like. I'm getting to the eggs, I promise.  I pretty much landed into Hong Kong feeling like a zombie but had to get stuck right into the proceedings of this event.  First up, a cocktail preceding dinner at renowned dining experience Yin Yang (weirdly enough, I tried to book a meal here last time I was in HK...).  In a group of about 18 peeps... there was Maggie Cheung bounding up to people introducing herself gaily and pretty much exuding friendliness and elegance.  Feeling small doesn't even quite cut it.  It is one of those cliches that everyone of Chinese origin (or maybe even non-Chinese origins...) universally hearts Maggie Cheung and she has 'national treasure' written all over (Judi Dench, you doth protest too much about the term...!) and frankly I'm not going to exempt myself.  She IS someone both my grandmother, my mother and me can get down with and after meeting her and err....  not creepily watching her at dinner... no, not at all.... I can go back home with happy reports.  The my mother will yelp with jealousy.
