Não queria que esse fosse o primeiro post com o novo template, mas sinceramente ontem eu não tinha muito a dizer, tamanho era a tristeza e o ódio que eu estava sentindo ao ver as notícias do começo do dia. A violência gratuita, o desprezo total a vida humana parece que não diminui. A cada dia novos detentores desse ódio nascem, e eles podem vir de qualquer classe social. Basta ter uma arma na mão, invocar Deus ou o Diabo, e cometer seus crimes hediondos. O assassinato do cartunista Glauco e de seu filho é a bola da vez. Quem será o próximo? Até quando a nossa sociedade vai permitir passivamente esses acontecimentos? Até quando nossos governantes tomarão consciência e fazerem o que deve ser feito? Alguma coisa tem que ser feita. Deve-se começar na base que é a Educação, para não ter que construir prisões e mais prisões no futuro. O gasto que se tem com esses infratores poderia ser redirecionado para outras áreas. O preso na cadeia deveria trabalhar pesado para conseguir o que comer. Mas infelizmente, os baluartes e defensores dos Direitos Humanos os tratam como se fossem coitadinhos, como se tirar a vida de um semelhante fosse apenas um mero detalhe. Não vou aqui discutir o fato do Glauco ser um pastor ou de que seu assassino clama ser Jesus (minha visão sobre religião e Deus já é bem conhecida), mas sim, discutir o homem, o profissional que ele foi, uma carreira que num ponto a minha vida eu quis seguir. Tive a oportunidade de conhecê-lo numa dessas convenções de quadrinhos ou prêmios do HQMix, durante os anos 90, e pude perceber a pessoa que ele representava apenas com um aperto de mão. Você conhece se a pessoa é boa ou má olhando em seus olhos e nas suas expressões faciais. Sua morte ao lado do filho, mostra que o ser humano é obscuro, maldoso e mesquinho. Um acontecimento desse abala a todos. Ontem, na Devir, podia se ver a tristeza das pessoas que trabalham na área, aquele sentimento de insegurança de algo que pode acontecer para qualquer um, basta haver a oportunidade, já que esses assassinos estão à nossa volta. Fica aqui a minha revolta e a minha homenagem ao profissional que se foi, mas que continua vivo em seus cartoons e tiras de quadrinhos eternizados tanto na mídia impressa quanto na digital.

Nessa semana dedicada às mulheres, não poderia faltar aqui, justamente nesta sexta, piadas sobre as mulheres. Portanto, meninas, divirtam-se e não me joguem pedras! Um homem e uma mulher, após uma noite num barzinho, resolvem ir para a casa dele para ficarem mais a vontade... Uma dose aqui, uma outra dose ali e a mulher resolve tomar a iniciativa dizendo, com voz melosa: - Me faz mulher!!!..... O homem, então, diante do olhar sedento da mulher, tira a roupa vagarosamente . Uma vez com suas roupas na mão, ele diz para ela: - Tome! vá lavá-las! Duas amigas se reencontram depois de muito tempo. - Olá, quanto tempo… Como é que vai? - Vou bem. E você? - Vou indo. Como vai seu marido? - Você não soube? Ele morreu faz dois meses. - Ah, eu não sabia! Que horror! - É, um horror… - Mas o que foi que aconteceu? - Foi de repente. Pedi pra ele ir comprar açúcar no supermercado, aí veio um ônibus e passou por cima dele. - Mas que coisa triste… - Pois é… Mas tudo bem. Tomei o café sem açúcar mesmo. Aquela mulher feia, coitada, tão desengonçada que nunca tinha conseguido ter um namorado, vai pedir auxílio a uma vidente. — Minha filha! Nessa vida, você não vai ser muito feliz no amor — prediz a mulher. — Mas na próxima encarnação você será uma mulher lindíssima, muito cobiçada e todos os homens se arrastarão aos seus pés. A mulher saiu dali muito feliz e ao passar por um viaduto, pensou: "Quando mais cedo eu morrer, mais cedo começa a minha outra vida!" e atirou-se lá de cima. Mas, por essas incríveis coincidências que só acontecem em sites de humor, ela não morreu porque caiu de costas em cima de um camião carregado de bananas e perdeu os sentidos. Assim que se recuperou, ainda atordoada e sem saber onde estava, começou a apalpar em volta de si e quando sentiu a protuberância das bananas, murmurou com um sorriso nos lábios: — Um de cada vez... por favor! Um de cada vez! Aos 18 anos, a mulher é como uma bola de futebol: tem 22 homens correndo atrás e milhares de homens de olho nela. Aos 28 anos, ela passa a ser como uma bola de basquete: mais rechonchuda, com dez homens correndo atrás e alguns colegas assistindo. Aos 38 anos, ela é como uma bolinha de golfe: tem só um homem andando atrás dela e meia dúzia de amigos olhando. Aos 48 anos, ela passa a ser como uma bolinha de pingue-pongue: um homem fica jogando pro outro! Em um congresso de mulheres estava sendo discutido quais eram as mais inteligentes: as morenas, as ruivas ou as loiras. Uma morena subiu ao palanque e disse: — Nós, morenas, fomos as primeiras mulheres a fabricar um computador! Todas as morenas aplaudiram. Então foi a vez da ruiva: — Nós, ruivas, fomos as primeiras mulheres a ir para a lua! A minoria ruiva aplaudiu. Até que uma loira subiu ao palanque. — Nós, as loiras, ainda não fizemos grande coisa, mas já temos um projeto de sermos as primeiras mulheres a ir até o sol! As mulheres caem na gargalhada e uma morena grita: — Se vocês foram até o sol, vão morrer esturricadas, suas antas! A loira chega bem perto do microfone e se explica: — Alôouuuuu! Mas nós vamos de noi-teeee! Três mulheres, uma noiva, uma casada e uma amante estava conversando sobre seus relacionamentos e decidiram agradar seus homens. Aquela noite todas as três iriam testar a sensualidade e o poder que exerciam sobre seus companheiros, usando corpete de couro, máscara nos olhos e botas de cano alto. Após alguns dias, elas tornaram a se encontrar. Cada uma relatou a sua experiência. Disse a noiva: - Naquela noite, quando meu namorado chegou em casa encontrou-me usando o corpete de couro, botas com 12cm de salto e máscara sobre os olhos. Ele me olhou intensamente e disse: "- Você é a mulher da minha vida, eu te amo." Então fizemos amor a noite inteira. A amante contou a sua versão: - Ah, comigo também foi parecido. Naquela noite encontrei meu amante no escritório. Estava usando um corpete de couro, mega saltos, máscara sobre os olhos e... mais nada! Usava uma capa de chuva para cobrir meu corpo. Quando eu abri a capa, ele não disse nada... seus olhos me devoraram... me agarrou e tivemos sexo a noite toda. E aí a casada contou sua história: - Naquela noite eu mandei as crianças para a casa da minha mãe. Arrumei-me como combinado: corpete de couro, super saltos, máscara sobre os olhos. Então resolvi incrementar o visual. Aproveitei para inaugurar um perfume novo e um batom vermelho que nunca tinha usado antes. Lembrei-me de um comentário que meu marido fez sobre a sensualidde da roupa íntima preta e coloquei a que acabara de comprar... um fio dental com um lacinho de cetim em ponto estratégico. Quando meu marido chegou do trabalho, abriu a porta e me encontrou em pé no meio do quarto fazendo caras e bocas. Olhou-me de cima abaixo endisse: "- E aí, Batman, o que temos para o jantar?"

Com ou sem embasamento, muitos falam sobre um determinado assunto, pois cada um tem o seu ponto de vista e o que é melhor, vivemos num país democrático e a liberdade de expressão é garantida pela constituição, embora certos setores nem pensem assim. Quando uma pessoa opina, ela quer passar o seu pensamento a respeito de alguma coisa, estando ela certa ou errada, é um direito dela, exclusivamente dela. Os outros podem concordar ou discordar, críticas e sugestões sempre são bem vindas, a não ser quando querem impor uma verdade, o que é discutível e também quando começam a atacar o autor. Eu aqui no meu blog, eu escrevo o que quero, o que penso, o que acredito ser certo. Aceito as críticas e respeito a opinião de quem discorda de mim, mas nunca aceitarei que me imponham algo. Não sou o dono da verdade e nem quero ser, mas eu só quero uma palavra: Respeito! Respeito que muitos não tiveram com o autor deste post no blog Nerds Somos Nozes . O Gabriel Radd , que eu não conheço, é um dos colaboradores do blog e começou a ser patrulhado e achincalhado por aqueles que não respeitam a opinião dos outros. Tudo porque ele escreveu que a literatura brasileira é um pé no saco e fez algumas comparações a J. R. R. Tolkien, por exemplo. Os defensores da cultura nacional e do politicamente correto cairam em cima e o Gabriel até pediu para que o seu post fosse apagado, por causa das proporções que chegou a polêmica. Ainda bem que os editores do Nerds Somos Nozes não apagaram o post em questão , porque seria uma tremenda censura, algo que lá atrás lutamos para que ela fosse extirpada da nossa sociedade. Eu não tenho rabo preso com ninguém, e portanto engrosso a discussão concordando que a Literatura brasileira é um tremendo pé no saco mesmo! E eu não coloco a culpa nos professores não. A Literatura faz parte do currículo e possui um conteúdo programático que tem que ser cumprido. Infelizmente os livros são massantes e sem nenhum apelo, muitos retratam épocas passadas que não interessantes segundo o meu ponto de vista. Se eu tivesse iniciado a leitura a partir dela, eu não teria gosto e nenhum apreço à leitura. Tudo é desestimulante, desde a paisagem até o português arcaico dos séculos anteriores. Talvez o modernismo ainda pareça interessante, mas é só. O meu gosto da leitura se deve a Stan Lee, Carl Barks, Richard Bach, Alan Moore, J. R. R. Tolkien, Peter David, Maurício de Souza, Roy Thomas, Jorge Amado (um brasileiro!!!), Ray Bradmoore, Clarice Lispector (uma brasileira!!!), etc, etc. Sim, eu cresci lendo muitos quadrinhos, ficção científica e RPG. Se hoje a leitura está inserida e latente em mim, eu não agradeço à Literatura Brasileira, pois ela destruiria totalmente esse meu prazer, que por muitas vezes tive que agüentar por causa unica e exclusivamente do vestibular. Espero que meus colegas de profissão Bauru e Jo_Angel não tenham se assustados com essas minhas declarações, a língua portuguesa é bela e rica, reconheço, mas a sua literatura é mesmo um pé no saco. E um recado para os patrulheiros de plantão: Eu não sigo a porra de reforma nenhuma, e não me venham reclamar que o trema caiu. Este artigo pertence ao Crazyseawolf's Blog .

The newest State of the Birds report is out and the news is not good. The 2010 Report concludes that accelerated climate change continues to alter the natural world as we know it, diminishing the quality of our environment and leaving a lasting impact on many bird species. The new report was released this week by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. “Just as they did in 1962 when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, our migratory birds are sending us a message about the health of our planet,” Salazar said. “That is why--for the first time ever--the Department of the Interior has deployed a coordinated strategy to plan for and respond to the impacts of climate change on the resources we manage.” Key findings from the “State of the Birds” climate change report include: • Oceanic birds are among the most vulnerable species because they don’t raise many young each year; they face challenges from a rapidly changing marine ecosystem; and they nest on islands that may be flooded as sea levels rise. All 67 oceanic bird species, such as petrels and albatrosses, are among the most vulnerable birds on Earth to climate change. • Hawaiian birds such as endangered species Puaiohi and ’Akiapōlā’au already face multiple threats and are increasingly challenged by mosquito-borne diseases and invasive species as climate change alters their native habitats. • Birds in coastal, arctic/alpine, and grassland habitats, as well as those on Caribbean and other Pacific islands show intermediate levels of vulnerability; most birds in aridlands, wetlands, and forests show relatively low vulnerability to climate change. • For bird species that are already of conservation concern such as the golden-cheeked warbler, whooping crane, and spectacled eider, the added vulnerability to climate change may hasten declines or prevent recovery. • The report identified common bird species such as the American oystercatcher, common nighthawk, and northern pintail that are likely to become species of conservation concern as a result of climate change. The report is a collaborative effort as part of the U.S. North American Bird Conservation Initiative, between federal and state wildlife agencies, and scientific and conservation organizations including partners from the American Bird Conservancy, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Klamath Bird Observatory, National Audubon Society, The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey.

Cross died February 28, 2010 of heart failure, following a fall at his home in Sanibel, Fla. Cross pursued many passions over his 86 years: He was a real estate lawyer, a publisher, a White House adviser and a leading spokesman for black economic development. He most known for his love of photographing waterbirds – something he didn't discover until he was in his 40s. "I was totally ignorant of birds, then — whammo — 20 years later they became a very important part of my life," Cross said in the NPR interview. "Except for family and friends, there's few things I care more about than these seabirds." His favorite bird was a Reddish Egret. Read, see his photos and hear the story on National Public Radio.

In partnership with Friends of Ballona Wetlands , Global Green and Heal the Bay , the 'Fill the Bill' reception will help IBRRC cover the cost of caring for over 400 cold, wet and starving California Brown Pelicans over the past 6 weeks. The event will include light refreshments, music, raffle and silent auction, and is open to the public. So if you are in the area, please come and support our pelicans! IBRRC would like to thank all the partners of this event for stepping up to make a difference to these majestic birds! Subscribe in a reader The International Bird Rescue Research Center (IBRRC) has admitted a staggering 435 wet and sick California Brown Pelicans since January 1, 2010. The good news is that more than 200 pelicans have been released back into the wild. At our Los Angeles bird center, 101 live pelicans currently are in care. The San Francisco Bay center has approximately 20. See the updated numbers in detail Wet, sick and dying pelicans have been flooding into IBRRC bird centers following the heavy rains, flooding and pollution from run-off that hit the California coast in early January 2010. As seabird specialists, IBRRC is doing its best to treat as many of these sick, cold and wet wildlife casualties at both of its California seabird rescue clinics. The public has responded to IBRRC's call for monetary help and donated supplies to assist this unprecedented rescue. We can still use more help: Please donate online Read the full report on our website Subscribe in a reader More than a dozen pelicans were released in San Pedro on Wednesday afternoon. The birds were found sick or injured, and nursed back to health at our bird center near Los Angeles Harbor. Staffers and volunteers at IBRRC released 14 pelicans that had been nursed back to health. They were set free at Royal Palms State Beach in San Pedro after 10 days of blood tests, treatment and food. Hundreds of Brown Pelicans have been found wet, sick and dying along the California coast since early January when El Nino like storms lashed the state with severe rain and flooding. IBRRC has been appealing to the public to help with the high cost of caring for these birds.

I promise I am not complaining. Really, I am not, although it may sound like I am. In doing battle with pirates everywhere, I have recently been unable to avoid the question... WHERE ARE ALL THE NINJAS??? I understand that we are difficult to pick out of a croud, and that we sorta specialize in the whole "solitary assassin" thing. If someone asked me, "hey, koalaMan, I am starting a ninja-union, do you want to join?" I would be like, "no way man! That's totally lame!" But really, you think that with my precision, my speed, and my general rage, I would sense a ninja from time to time, but the radar is pretty much flatlined these days, which is not cool at all. Don't get me wrong, I am not scared of pirates. They are totally wusses, and ten pirates wouldn't stand a chance against even a modestly-adept ninja (say, one that has a weakness for the biscuits or something.) However, we do need to get down out of the tree, unsheath our shurikens and our laser guns, and get George Washington on their Martin Van Buren asses! Like the 8th president of the United States, pirates may be dense, hairy wusses, but also like ole' kinderhook, pirates stick together and help their own to get ahead. Furthermore, they have recently been demonstrating a disturbing aptitude for improving their image through various media, like music and cinema . Every day it seems like I see some person who seems okay at first, but then is like, "yeah, I love pirates! They are really cool!" Why? I think you know, and so I'll spare you the tirade. But seriously, ninjas-- time is short. Remember, especially while you Yanks are giving thanks today, that a real ultimate holiday is coming up, and then it will be time to show thanks. Flip out on a pirate. Eat a bagel (or a muffin) while wailin' on a scone-eater. Do something, anything, just to show that we're out there. We gotta start biting back, or we'll be drinkin' rum and reelin' like vermin before you know it. Okay, so obviously, I had better apologize for not having gotten a post up for a year. To be honest, I was getting a bit too comfortable up in the tree. It seemed that we ninjas had the whole "pirate problem" under control. As if their insipid music weren't enough, their complete and utter aversion to electric guitars was a sure sign of bad taste. Yeah, life seemed good... ... but only because I had my head stuck up in my, err, tree! The other day, while I was tryin' to rub the sleep and the blood from my most recent victim from my eyes, I heard one of my wee ones screamin' "arrrrrrrrrr....." What? What is this? I cannot be. "Little one," I asked, "what was that?" Surely she was just practicing her frisbee-folding techniques or something I thought, but again she yelled, "arrrrrrrrr....." To which I responded "What is that?" The next thing I heard had me looking for a laser guided, scone-coated, frisbee of death. "I'm a pirate daddy! arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr....." Okay, so it's like that now. Can't fight me wuss-to-marsupial, eh? Have to go after the Joey's huh? Well, now it's on. You know that look that women tend to get when you tell them that men are better drivers, or that barristas get when you tell them their espresso is almost as good as Starbucks? Well, that's me now. I am that barrista, and I am that women. Err, or not. But you get my point. I am totally pissed, and pirates are going to get hurt. And not just by me either. No, I am calling up the real ultimate ninja: George Freakin' Washington! Yeah, and we're going to put a hurt down on anyone who gets in our way. Pain is coming, and it's coming hard and fast. By flipping out and wasting pirates all over the world you can be sure: we are going to save children, but not save pirate children. Oh yes, make no mistake: the world's scurvy rate's are goin' down for sure. Oh, and in case you're wondering, the Joey's are all fine now. I'll tell that story one day, but for now, I cannot make merriment until pirate faces are hurt. I'm here. I would like to start by apologizing for not posting EVER. especially the post about the Thomas Kincade edition Lincoln Navigator: Im sure it would have been funny. I am hoping I will be writhing more. We just moved stuff into our apartment on Tuesday, so we have been settling in, but it was not long before we saw some miniature Jello molded to the likeness of San Francisco. Were we all made for a purpose? Sure. And what on Earth are we here for? Community of course. If I wanted to, I could explain to you the five pillars that support both of these claims. However, I would instead like to take a moment to introduce something else: my purpose driven Louisville Slugger. This thing is long, slim, and can apply a total beat-down to any pirate, dog, old lady, or wannabe gangsta to which I may apply it. Unlike Pant's intellect, it cannot be stopped. Seriously, this thing is bona fide. Like all important issues that you face in life, this bat's significance can be characterized by 5 central points, that is, it ROCKS: 1.)R: it Represents true ultimate power. 2.)O: it Opens a can of whoop ass on those who deserve it 3.)C: it is Cool and sweet and awesome and makes me want to crap myself 4.)K: it Kills anyone to whom it is applied 5.)S: it is Stealth , so that by the time it has struck, you are like, "WOW! I am totally dead!" See, my bat ROCKS. But if one person's bat rocks, then anyone can ignore that. But what if you, that's right, you were to apply these simple principals to your life? Then there would be two bats that rock. That's two purpose driven bats... imagine! Now, let's keep this going. Lets say we had the whole of Chucktown totin' purpose driven bats. Imagine! We would all be like, "I am totally pissed! I wanna kill, kill, kill!", and so all the pirates would be crapping themselves, like, "Oh my god! We are so totally dead!" Well, you get the idea. The nation, the whole world even, united under this simple ROCKS principal, then we would all be totally sweet, and all the pirates would be all beat up, and bloody, and not even dead, but like, "aw, man, this totally hurts! I would kill myself, but I am not even cool enough for that!" And what a great sight that would be. But it all starts with you. And with me. I know that you probably have all sorts of complicated questions, but I assure you that it is really simple. Just go and do. Be purpose driven. Don't let questions and doubt get the better of you. If we all just go out and do it, then we cannot be stopped. A thought occurred to me while stalking a crepe vendor the other day. Whereas I don't wear any clothing, I do notice the clothing of those around me. After all, humans all look alike to me, and so while instructing younger pastries, I'm all like "No, kill the one in the green shirt." What I've noticed is this: while so-called hipsters have been wearing vintage clothing for years, now all of the major clothing chains are selling faux "vintage" shirts. I'm talking like Abercrombie and Fitch 1972, or Old Navy hopscotch team and shit like that. It's kinda lame, but I am looking forward, in fifteen years time, to being able to go to the Salvation Army and purchasing a shirt that is both real vintage and fake vintage at the same time. I've been visiting the Violent Dismemberment Happy Bakery and Deli where I was born this week, and I'll tell you, I wasn't as disrespectful or obnoxious as the confections you see nowadays. First of all, what ever happened to just a regular, tasty, non-hugemongous, un-nasty muffin? VDHB and D is now full of some freakin' obese muffins. Just because you are a source of simple carbohydrates, that's no excuse for carbo-loading all the time you disgusting bran-piggies. Also, muffins should not smell like ham. Another thing, I'm not a racist, but the music these doughnuts are listening to these days really get my filling. (Oh, I'm sorry, that's the REAL spelling, not your hip doughnut vernacular.) I'm just saying that the bakers really need to put their feet down; these delicious baked goods are fresh out of the oven and don't know what's up, they need guidance. Good thing they have an older brother to show them how to throw down. Me and some of the kiddies went on a field trip to assassinate some prominent squirrels in the area (I hate me some fuckin' squirrels). I brought the doughnuts, bearclaws, muffins, and croissants, but not the bagels, as they are a bunch of chewy momma's boys. We staged a daring midnight raid on a major squirrel stronghold, i.e. a big tree. We fought long, fought hard, and occasionally, fought well. By morning, the crack-addicted mammals lay defeated, and several pigeons too. Only half of my squad was killed by the squirrels, pigeons, and morning rush-hour traffic. If that price seems steep, bear in mind we come in pans of twelve. OK, so one thing is certain: no one wants to be the guy posting after the mountain that is " Cap'n Romeo the Lusty and Juliet-san." So, consider this the follow-on post. It was going to be a disappointment no matter what, so no loss. Now that it's out of the way, maybe we can move on with our mortal lives.
Something I am pursuing is graphic design. Here is a banner I am making for Sphere of Hip Hop . Maybe they'll use it? This was made not with Adobe Illustrator but with a program like Illustrator called Xara. I'm still trying to figure out the program, for example there are some lines I'd like to get rid of so that it would be easier to see that the abstract figures in the background spell "Sphere of Hip Hop". UPDATE: did just that this morning. This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com Use your resources in planning an event. Without the help of my friends and people they knew, the event planning for Hip Hop Hunger would not have gone as well as it did. Your resources will of course be different than mine, but I thought it would be helpful for me to provide this list. Here is a list of my resources for promotion and how I used them: Situational: [] RHS (Rogers High School) Leadership's room for making posters and lunchtime announcements. [] Making a watercolor picture advertising the event as a project for Art Class. [] Inviting friends from church and school. [] Meeting and inviting friends' friends from church and school. [] Meeting and inviting friends' friends' friends from church and school (okay you get the point). Helpful People: [] Teachers' and students' wisdom with experience [] Musical Artists I mostly had already had some form of communication with [] The RHS school newspaper calendar [] Students in my leadership class and friends who added unique colors to the black and white posters. NOTE: if you're planning on doing this event at your school, you may want to ask someone in charge if it's okay to make the event information available to everyone in and out of school or to what groups can you advertise the event. Online I used: [] The Hip Hop Is Music forums (for asking questions on how to promote an event) [] BLOGGER.com for making a website to promote the event [] Local Community Websites [] Facebook for inviting friends to come [] The News Tribune's (local paper) online calendar [] Upcoming Yahoo!'s online events listing [] ClubFlyers.com for flyers (thanks Leonard for recommending this!) [] Sphere of Hip Hop's forums for advertising Other posts in this series: Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com Communication is not really a "step," but it is one of the most important things. In the Hip Hop Hunger event, it was my fault that for the longest time I didn't know that my school's portable stage wasn't stable enough for rapping and dancing, so I found that out with only a week before the event will happen. As I write this (I'm writing this on Friday, Feb 22) I'm wondering if someone will be able to donate a portable stage on Wednesday. Other than this, things have ran smoothly because of early communication. If this is your first event you're planning, you should probably talk with some people you know who have event experience and ask them if they can give you advice. My friends who are in a rock band called Supersonia have had many successful events, about two per year from sophomore year to senior year. Before I planned the Hip Hop Hunger Event I sat down with one of them at a coffee shop and took notes about how to plan an event. So if you know someone at your school who's done something remotely similar to what you are planning, then talk with them. Forms of Communication The type of communication you have with people will depend on your event and your goals. In the Hip Hop Hunger event, it was my goal to get some big name acts at it, and I used email with them. It doesn't hurt to ask especially if it's for charity. It doesn't hurt to have at least that small connection with someone in which you invited them to come but they couldn't make it. If the event is for-profit (as opposed to for-charity) you will have to figure out your budget because then it is likely you would pay the artists. (If the event is not some sort of fundraiser or charity event and you want to do it at school, you might have to pay the school or venue.) I also contacted people at my school, and when I talked to them, I just spoke and exchanged phone numbers. Also it's good to figure out what is the best way of communication for the artist/event-crew-person. If you're using email and you have their phone number, and it takes awhile for them to respond, then try calling! Also if you get stuck in a game of phone tag or if the other person prefers email, then email is a good choice. The best way of course, is to speak face-to-face, and if that's an option it's good to do it at least twice before the event. Tone and Attitude Here is a good article about writing effective emails: CD Baby on Writing Good Emails . In whatever way you contact someone, your attitude should be that you are requesting and not forcing anything on someone. Also, if someone agrees to help you, even if it's their job, you should approach them with the attitude that they are doing something extra for you. Your heart should be thankful and if you are, they will remember that. Other posts in this series: Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com Hey Everyone, I am introducing a blog post series about planning events and concerts. When I was planning the Hip Hop Hunger event, I looked online for something about planning events and I couldn't find anything. But, I talked with friends and people I knew who had more experience, and I learned a lot. While I am no expert, I think I can share some helpful information that is worth considering. Keep in mind that you should probably take the advice of someone wiser than me, but hopefully this will get you started. To get you started here is step 1, when I make a new post in this series, I will bump this post up and write a phrase that summarizes the new post: Other posts in this series: Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com The first question to be answered in event planning is "What will this event be and what is it for?" So start broad and think of all the ideas you can, figure out where you're going with it and go from there. Someone emailed me with a question about planning events, and this is how I responded: The first step is to brainstorm and write down every idea you can think of. The ideas can be as out-of-the-box as you want because having something unique helps. Then I'd say to go over your and your friends' ideas, if you're doing this with a group, and pick something. Then after you figure out what it is exactly you want to do, you should talk with the activities coordinator at your school [or an equivalent key person if it's not at school] with a few event dates in mind and find out if any of them will work. Once you have the event day chosen, you will want to make a timeline stating when you want to contact all the artists/performers and important elements of the show such as sound, lights, and a stage. Earlier is better of course and it's good to plot this out. For the Hip Hop Hunger event, I started contacting artists around November of 2007 even though the concert wasn't until February 08. If the event is something you're passionate about that will make it better, it has to be something you'll be willing to go outside of your comfort zone for. Once you go outside your comfort zone enough times, you'll forget it was there and that will make things easier in the future. Other posts in this series: Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com As an artist and a student, keeping my priorities straight is important. So any free time in which I'm not doing rapping, which won't be much time, will be the time that I update the blog. Obviously I love blogging but it wouldn't make sense to spend more time blogging than making music, right? The future of this blog. Someone made a very good point that I should upload some of my music on the site or at least link to a site that does have some of my music. I haven't been in a recording studio yet but I hope to sometime in March and then I will have some music to put online. But that might come after the initial wave of attention. Maybe someone will record a video from the Hip Hop Hunger event? Another thing I might do is a blog post series on how to have a successful event and what goes into that. Hip Hop Hunger is the first event I've ever planned and I learned a lot that I think I could share with people. When I was planning the event I looked for things online and I didn't come across much on event planning, so I talked with people and that was very helpful. A last thing might be to publish some some short stories if I have time, but don't hold your breath, that's at the bottom of my "to-do" list. Thanks for reading! This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com I've been blogging off and on for about 3 years and this was a surprise that I don't think you can prepare for. When I first saw that my site was a blog of note, I didn't know how to react, because I only created the Hip Hop Hunger website to promote a single event. I guess that shows how much a difference site design can make. In a semi-panic, I made a post explaining exactly what the site was and who I am, and then thanks to peoples' suggestions, I put a link in the upper-right of the blog so that people could donate to the charity WorldVision because I realized that a lot of people seeing the site would not be able to come to the event. Also I think I did not react the best way I could have but being a blogger and an artist you could say that I wanted to connect with some people and address them and talk about myself, which doesn't really fit for the Hip Hop Hunger website, which is not supposed to be a blog, but a website for an event that is about something much bigger than me. So, I wanted to add something to the top of the welcome message to put the focus of that site back where it should be, which is that this event is for charity, specifically for hunger in Africa. Someone brought up some good points about food aid on the site at The Cause section . You can follow the conversation there. I tried to answer questions the best I could. This post originally appeared on http://surveihiphop.blogspot.com I know, it sounds like some sort of nerdy liscense-plate frame but it's true. The funny part is that it isn't even really a blog! What I did was I hacked the blogger format to create a webpage for my Hip Hop event known as Hip Hop Hunger . I put a lot into the design of that site but not a lot of writing, and this blog, however, is the opposite: a lot of writing and not a lot of design, yet. But it's the writing that really counts. As an artist and blogger, I am thankful for this publicity, but it's too bad I don't have any music samples of my rapping for y'all to listen to! Well, I'll give what I can, and that is my excitement. I'm excited about my future as a rapper and I am definitely a beginner but I'm learning and taking it a step at a time. Each time I reach a milestone I'm going to "document" it here for me to look back on, and if that peaks anyone's interest well I hope somehow God could use these words on a screen two feet in front of you to affect us positively.

I turned the water on as hot as I could stand it. Steam quickly filled the room and choked out the air as I stepped naked into the shower. (The next part is embarrassing and humiliating to admit.) Facing the water, I closed my eyes. I took a deep breath and held it as I interlocked my fingers tightly behind my head and leaned forward into the stream pouring down. Titling my head toward the ground, I allowed the water to wash over my neck and back, hoping to release the built-up tension in my shoulders and constriction looming deep within my chest. Then a giant exhale. With my forehead now resting against the shower wall and my forearms squeezing the blood surrounding my temples, I remembered to relax. To stop trying to hold on to it. To let it flow through me like rain. And it did. And as a result, I kind of lost it. I started to cry - a very rare occurrence for me! Although I can't be sure if they were tears or just water droplets from the showerhead falling to my feet. Either way, it doesn't matter and neither does this confession. This story has nothing to do with blogging. Although it does help explain some of the recent events happening in my life which have led to a few decisions, including this one... Today marks my 999th post here on The Rest Is Still Unwritten . It also marks the day I say goodbye to blogging. I've always said that the day blogging ceases to be fun for me is the day I step away. That day has come. So I'm stepping back (backspacing?) from writing. I've enjoyed the 5+ year journey, but I no longer feel inspired to write. Lots of things still left to say, just no energy or will to say them. What was once a creative outlet that I've describe as "therapeutic," now feels excruciatingly painful for me to continue. The joy just simply isn't there...and neither are the words. It should go without saying, this makes me incredibly sad. This isn't an impulse decision. It's something I've been mulling over for some time now, evidence of this Tweet (pictured above) from last week. I considered deleting the entire blog and not saying a word as to why, but I felt that wouldn't be fair to you, the reader. Plus, I didn't want to deal with answering countless questions of what happened, people thinking it was just a system glitch. Instead I'm allowing my little corner of the web to stand as is. You're welcome to browse through the rather extensive Archive . But I can't say when, if ever, I'll return. My realization is one that is not...umm, happy. In the past, I've seen writing as a gift. For it has given me the ability to express the things in my everyday life that are often too difficult for me to verbalize. So I put pen to paper in my coveted Moleskine or I blog about it here. I write it all out and I write through it. This time it's different. This time I can't write about it and what's even more difficult is that I've realized I have no one to even talk about it with to help me cope. I don't have that type of relationship with any of my buddies or even with anyone in my family. It's like emotional paralysis where feeling too much is leaving me numb. So instead I'm choosing to share nothing. I'm keeping quiet and keeping to myself. And if the day comes that I feel the urge to write here again, there won't be some lame teaser Tweet to build up online anticipation or a dramatic comeback post! I'll simply slide in just as quietly and unannounced as I slid out. Because in the end, I want to live by my motto - Write Like No One Is Reading. xoxo, David PS (Please don't e-mail me wanting to suddenly be my friend and offer your ear. While I appreciate the kind gesture and I'm sure you mean well, this letter is not my plea for help. It's more or less a PSA as to what is happening on my blog. Also, I'm sorry if this news leaves anyone feeling disappointed. But understand that life happens. And when it does, we cope the best way we know how. Perhaps this will only be a short hiatus. So keep me in your reader, keep me linked and check back soon. Again, my apologies.) ---NOTE--- The follow-up from 1/21/10 - Release After the Melissa Blake fiasco , I swore I would never guest post for anyone ever again! And I didn't, until my friend Elisa Doucette from OpheliasWebb.com convinced me otherwise. Since February is dubbed "the month of love," Elisa put together a great blog series project all about love. She selected 28 bloggers to guest post on the topic and has published their words throughout the entire month of February. 1 Blog. 1 Topic. 1 Month. 28 Days. 28 Guest Bloggers. Although a lie, I like to pretend she saved the best for last by making me the final guest blogger in the series with this post below. Clarity "I want you to get swept away out there. I want you to levitate. I want you to...sing with rapture and dance like a dervish. Be deliriously happy, or at least leave yourself open to be. I know it's a cornball thing. But love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. I say, fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back. How do you find him? Well, you forget your head, and you listen to your heart. And I'm not hearing any heart. 'Cause the truth is, honey, there's no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love, well, you haven't lived a life at all. But you have to try, 'cause if you haven't tried, you haven't lived." - Anthony Hopkins role as "Bill Parrish" in the movie Meet Joe Black, heart to heart father/daughter talk Love is a crazy, dizzy thing. Sometimes it’s all so beautiful I can hardly stand it. I want to capture it. So I take a photograph. To make time stand still. I freeze the moment for all eternity and hang that memory on a wall. But then that doesn’t seem like enough. The photograph allows me to recall that exact same vision I once had, but it doesn’t give me the movement. The way that one strand of hair kept blowing across her face, attempting to unite with her bottom lip. Or the way the early morning sunlight pardoned the rain, reflecting and dancing across the small of her back from the dusty windowpane. ...read the rest of my Guest Post here. Also, be sure to check out the other bloggers (some really talented writers included) who participated in the series. Elisa’s "All You Need Is Love" blog series project will definitely get you thinking and questioning love and your own life. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" Is is a philosophical riddle that raises questions regarding observation and knowledge of reality. That theory is called "subjective idealism" and refers to a time in which objects cease to exist once there is nobody around to perceive them. However, one may argue that... "if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it really fall?" Meaning - the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived. The common sense answer is yes. It obviously makes a sound since we know that a tree falling makes noise regardless of whether anyone is around or not. The metaphysical answer is no. The tree does not make a sound if no one is there to witness it falling. And indeed the act of making a sound isn't even a quandary, all that matters is that the tree in fact ceases to exist if no one is there to witness it. The production of sound requires 3 things: a source, a medium, and a receiver. But what about happiness? It also needs the same 3 elements. So is happiness only real when shared? There is the possibility of unperceived existence. That something can exist without being perceived. If no one is around to see, hear, or feel your happiness, does it not exist? Does happiness need a witness? Someone to validate it? Someone to share in it to make it real? For years I didn't realize how unhappy I was until I was happy. And you never realize how happy you were until that happiness disappears from your life. Happiness is not tangible, but yet it feels very fragile in our hands. Hold too tightly and you smother it. Hold too carelessly and you lose it. Unclasp your hands and you share it. Open your heart and you receive it. I believe happiness can exist alone in ourselves, but I feel it is far more satisfying when shared. In an ideal world, we would share a piece of happiness with someone everyday. Touch them in some way to let them know their existence matters. However, life is anything but ideal. It is often difficult to prove to someone how happy they make you. Whether that happiness is mutually shared or not, the only thing concrete about the emotion is that YOU know it to exist. I know it exists because I can feel it, like 10-million fireflies filling my chest cavity. I may not always be able to explain it or even prove it. But trust me, it exists and it's incredibly real. So what do you think? True or false? Is happiness only real when shared? There is a reason the young are naive. It protects us from the harsh truths and cold realities of a life we are not yet ready to see. As children, we aren't prepared to deal with the heartbreak and confusion that later reveals itself with age and wisdom. Like every kid, I looked up to my father. I idolized him. Worshiped him! He was my Superman. A man that could do no wrong. A man that was always right. A man that knew best. And a man that was in fact human. It often takes years before we see our parents for who they really are. Not these fictitious superheroes we have built-up in our mind and heart, but rather people. People that make mistakes. It was only a year after I graduated college that I learned that painful lesson. That the man I had admired and role modeled myself after for 20+ years of my life had been telling me embellished truths. While the phrase "embellished truth" sounds more pleasing to the ear than the word "lie," both are essentially the same. To embellish is to enhance (a statement or narrative) with fictitious additions, to beautify it. Simply put, it's a fancy lie. If you have ever seen the movie "Resurrecting The Champ," you'll be familiar with parts of what I'm about to say... A writer, like a boxer, must stand alone. Having your words published, like entering a ring, puts your talents on display. And there's nowhere to hide. I don’t intend to write a story about myself or my father. Or about love. Or the lies that can sometimes come from love. We live in that fear. I will tell you this about the man I call Dad. He is, against all reason, my friend. And he is also a liar. But was that because he was trying to make himself better than who he was? Or was it because the one force more powerful than a son wanting the admiration of his father is the father wanting the admiration of his son? Sometimes we need the help of our imagination to achieve that status. For it is no easy task being the strongest, wisest and most beloved man in all the land. And what is sadder is that moment when our children discover that we are not the illusory superman we've created, but rather, as Herman Melville once wrote..."men drained of valor." The lies that come from love can devastate as much as those that come from malice. Dad's legacy, I suppose is the inspiration for truth. A beauty that lets our children admire us unconditionally as I love my father. Today is my BFF's 3rd birthday! Yes, my BFF is a dog. Or at least to you he's a dog. To me he is sooo much more than I can even put into words! Actually, I can attempt to put it into words and I very much wanted to do just that today in celebration of his birthday. However, time is of the essence. And because I would rather spend more time playing WITH him on his birthday than blogging ABOUT him, I'm going to keep this post short and sweet. I'm re-posting the poem I posted on his 1st birthday. Then I'm cutting out of work early, taking him on a shopping spree at Petsmart , to the dog park to play with his friends, then home to do a little backyard sledding/snowboarding (his favorite), and finally inside by the fire to warm up couch cuddling. Go ahead and laugh. Think I'm crazy or think I'm joking. I'm neither. This is how I want to spend my Friday night. Like a fine aged wine, our love only gets better with time. And there's no one else I rather spend my days with. Happy birthday to my favorite chunk of meat. I love you, Diesel! A Boy And His Dog by Edgar Guest A boy and his dog make a glorious pair No better friendship is found anywhere For they talk and they walk and they run and they play And they have their deep secrets for many a day And that boy has a comrade who thinks and who feels Who walks down the road with a dog at his heels He may go where he will and his dog will be there May revel in mud and his dog will not care Faithful he'll stay for the slightest command And bark with delight at the touch of his hand Oh, he owns a treasure which nobody steals Who walks down the road with a dog at his heels No other can lure him away from his side He's proof against riches and station and pride Fine dress does not charm him, and flattery's breath Is lost on the dog, for he's faithful to death He sees the great soul which the body conceals Oh, it's great to be young with a dog at your heels! ---NOTE--- 12/7/05 - Define Sexy (Recommended reading before you start the post below.) Everyone has a different definition of sexy. Five years ago on my blog I attempted to define what the word "sexy" meant to me. However, I left out one keyword - independent. At the time I was working under a female boss and despite the fact she was in her mid-40s and old enough to be my Mother, I felt this very strong attraction to her. She was attractive, but her physical appearance is not what drew me to her. It was a quality she possessed, the type of lifestyle she lived. She was an independent woman and it was so incredibly sexy to me! The best thing about being single and dating is that through the years you discover exactly what it is that you really want...or in my case, what I didn’t want. I’m not a MILF hunter or cougar lover. I date girls my own age. However, I've come to realize that the vast majority of girls I had dated and had relationships with have not been independent women. Perhaps that is partially why none of those relationships worked out. Or perhaps getting a taste of what a relationship with an independent woman is really like is all that I needed to wet my appetite and have me craving my very own Miss Independent. It’s a well known fact that most guys are intimidated by powerful women. They simply can’t handle it. For some, a woman that is fully capable of taking care of herself and doesn’t need a man in her life is a giant blow to the male ego. It takes a very confident man to be with an independent woman. He has to be secure with who he is and rarely doubt his ability to please her. He must understand that although he may not be needed in her life, he is wanted in her life. I love independent women, but I would be lying if I said moments of doubt and bits of insecurity don’t creep into my head when it comes to being with a Miss Independent. There are so many 20-somethings (both guys and girls) out there that don’t have a clue what they are doing! They are in dept up to their eyeballs, but instead of working to pay off that debt, they decide to just travel the world and live this carefree "I’m going to find myself" lifestyle. Sure that modern day hippie/slacker shit sounds all poetic and fun, but it’s not long before reality comes along to slap them in the face, waking them from their dreamy state. They don’t know what they want to be when they grow up, despite the fact they’ve been a grownup for years! They teeter back and forth about going to school or going back to school. They really haven’t given much thought to the future or set any long term goals. Most haven’t even set short term goals! So they drift aimlessly from one location to the next, one job to the next, and one relationship to the next. And when it comes to love, their track record consists of binge drinking and hooking up, rather than any actual dating or a real relationship past. This is why an independent woman is sooo refreshing! I want a 20-something girl that has direction in her life and not only knows what she wants, but is already well on that path to achieving it. She knows who she is, where she’s been
 and where she is going. And she wears $800 stilettos during every step of the way, not to flaunt her success, but because she’s worth it! She has earned it. She is strong. She is sexy. She is Miss Independent. And yes, although a rare breed, she does exist. "Miss Independent" by Ne-Yo Ooh, it's something about, just something about the way she move. I can't figure it out. There's something about her. Said ooh, it's something about kinda woman that want you, but don't need you. Hey, I can't figure it out. There's something about her. 'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss. Manicured nails to set the pedicure off. She's fly effortlessly. And she move like a boss, do what a boss do. She got me thinking about getting involved. That's the kinda girl I need. (Chorus) She got her own thing, that's why I love her. Miss Independent, won't you come and spend a little time? She got her own thing, that's why I love her. Miss Independent, ooh the way we shine. Miss Independent, yeah. Ooh, there's something about kinda woman that can do for herself. I look at her and it makes me proud. There's something about her. There's something oh so sexy about kinda woman that don't even need my help. She said, she got it, she got it. No doubt, there's something about her. 'Cause she work like a boss, play like a boss. Car and a crib she bout to pay 'em both off. And her bills are paid on time. She made for a boss, only a boss. Anything less she telling them to get lost. That's the girl that's on my mind. (Repeat Chorus) Mmm, her favorite thing to say, don't worry I got it. Mmm, and everything she got best believe she bought it. Mmm, she going steal my heart, ain't no doubt about it. Girl, you're everything I need. Said you're everything I need. (Repeat Chorus) Miss Independent. That's why I love her. I never understood people who are into celebrity gossip. Who is crushing on who. Whose marriage is on the rocks. Or who is secretly tying the knot. I mean really, who cares? It's TMI. I subscribe to the belief that what happens behind closed doors is no one's damn business...uh, that's why the door is closed! This is exactly why I rarely ask any of my buddies who they are dating. It's not uncaring of me, it's respectful. Of course I will go into "slumber party mode" with female friends so they can get all girly, giggly and giddy gushing over some boy. I am happy for them and they are welcome to share their excitement with me. Although, for the most part, other people's romantic/sexual interests don't interest me. We live in a world of information overload these days. So I'm perfectly happy and content NOT knowing who is banging who. In fact, I prefer it that way. Besides, what purpose does that information serve me or anyone else for that matter? It would only satisfy the nosey. Don't be nosey. Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT) is the common term for the policy stopping openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals from serving in the United States military. This federal law is in place because they claim "it would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order, discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." Therefore the act prohibits any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships while serving in the United States armed forces. My thoughts on the topic surrounding ANYONE'S personal relationship business, regardless if the person is gay or straight...Don't Ask. Don't Tell. Don't Care. And if it slips out, still I don't care. It doesn't affect my life in the least and it doesn't make me think any more or less about you as a person. It is what it is. I don't care if you're gay. I don't care if you're straight. I don't care if you're married, divorced, single, or have 2.5 kids. I don't care if you're black. I don't care if you're white. I don't care who you slept with, how many people you slept with, or how long it's been since you slept with anyone! All I care about is if you can do your job. If you can cover my back when bullets and bombs fly. Can you do that? Will you do that? If you answered yes to both questions, then what's the problem here? Why not let gays in the military? Who you are attracted to shouldn't make you less of a solider. Just like being attracted to big bottomed brunettes instead of big breasted blondes wouldn't make you any less of a solider either. We just have different tastes, that's all. It should be noted that there are already gay people in our military, but they are in there because they've kept their sexual preferences hush-hush. But when did who you are attracted to have anything to do with the capabilities of performing your job? A problem is often complicated, but the solution is often simple. What's difficult is the follow through. And in this case, getting the rest of the country to see it as such. The fact is this - no one is condoning giant orgies to facilitate in the Army Barracks. And regardless of what your occupation is, very few employers are accepting of romantic/sexual relationships taking place at work. So I think we could all understand and completely accept a rule/law stating that any type of romantic/sexual relationship is forbidden to form in our U.S. military. But to deny someone the opportunity to serve our country simply because they like boys instead of girls seems unbelievable to me! What really irritates me is many of the homophobes who are complaining about having gays in the military, saying "they aren't man enough to serve," lack the balls to serve themselves! I hate to quote a Hollywood scripted movie when trying to relate to a real world issue, but I have to say that Jack Nicholson as Col. Jessep in "A Few Good Men" summed this up best when he declared... "I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!" ---NOTE--- Related post of interest... 11/5/08 - One Giant Leap Forward And One Giant Leap Backwards When this year’s Super Bowl matchup was announced, Saints vs Colts, I renamed it to the Super Snooze. I felt it would lack that action packed, hard-nosed, 60 minutes of thrilling NFL football I was accustom to watching. I’m happy to report that I was wrong. The game was actually competitive and pretty exciting! And the commercials weren’t too shabby either...or at least that was my personal opinion when I went into work on Monday morning. I figured there would be Peyton Manning fans whining, but what I didn't expect were women to be shouting sexism! Sexism, really? I’m sorry, the ads are only seen as sexist if you twist the humor out of them. So lighten up. They aren’t sexist. They are geared toward men! So if you’re not a man, there is a good chance you wouldn’t enjoy something geared to men. Correct? That’s why women subscribe to Cosmo and not Maxim. So what makes you think the Super Bowl should be the exception to that rule? I wouldn’t tune into the Oxygen channel or the Lifetime Movie Network and expect the commercials there to be geared toward me. Let me make something clear to everyone. Football, just like any other televised event/show, has a target audience. The NFL marketing demographic is aimed at males ages 18-34. That is their target audience, who is tuning into the games. So it's only smart business for advertisers to create commercials that appeal to the vast majority of NFL fans, males ages 18-34. Needless to say, young adult males are into beer, tits, technology, cars, and potty humor. This is why when you watch football, and especially the Super Bowl, you see ads for Bud, big breasted GoDaddy.com girls and muscle cars. Sexist? No. Smart! The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year's Super Bowl was $2.6 million! Do you really think any company would waste that kind of cash on a commercial that doesn't grab the attention of males ages 18-34, their target audience? If you were selling Tampax tampons, you would air your ad during "Oprah." If you were selling Viagra, you would air your ad during re-runs of "Murder She Wrote." And if you were selling Zhu-Zhu Pets you would air your ad during "Dora The Explorer." Women, you’re more than welcome to watch the game with men. Although you will never see any man scream "SEXIST" if a woman makes a remark about how tight the QB’s butt looks or how you live in Florida, but you’re rooting for the NY Jet’s simply because Mark Sanchez is cute. Football is a game filled with testosterone, blood and sweat. Men behaving like beasts! Wrestling and roughing each other up in a battle of strength and strategy. So don’t be surprised (or complain) that watching football makes me want to eat meat, drink beer and burp. It brings out the animal in us. Personally, I think it’s healthy to hang with the boys and yell "FUCK" during bad ref calls. I also think it’s perfectly normal for me to drool over two hot chicks in lingerie making out. And it’s perfectly normal that I want to jump up and cheer when I see a man taking a stand for himself instead of being emasculated by an over controlling woman. If that makes me a caveman or a sexist pig, so be it. FloTV (watch here) takes a regular Joe Schmoe and states that his girlfriend removed his spine, made him go shopping instead of "letting him" stay home to watch the game. They then encourage him to change out of his skirt and get a FloTV so he can watch sports on the go, AKA in the mall. In another ad, Dockers (watch here) incorporates a slogan that is as old as the day is long when it comes to relationships. They’re calling all men and instructing them that "it’s time to wear the pants." We all know what that means! But it was Dodge Chrysler's Super Bowl spot (watch here) that got feminists fired up the most! Titled "Man's Last Stand," the narrator is as bold as they come, saying... I will get up and walk the dog at 6:30AM. I will eat some fruit as part of my breakfast. I will shave. I will clean the sink after I shave. I will be at work by 8am. I will sit through two hour meetings. I will say yes when you want me to say yes. I will be quiet when you don't want to hear me say no. I will take your call. I will listen to your opinion of my friends. I will listen to your friends' opinions of my friends. I will be civil to your mother. I will put the seat down. I will separate the recycling. I will carry your lip balm. I will watch your vampire TV shows with you. I will take my socks off before getting into bed. I will put my underwear in the basket. And because I do this, I will drive the car I want to drive. Know why this is funny? Because ALL men have felt this way before! If you haven't, then you must not be married, haven't talked to married men, or haven't been in any type of relationship long enough to experience this robot-like lifestyle. It's like being a shell of a man where you lose the balls to say no or disagree. You simply do as you're told because thinking on your own and doing what you want causes too much drama in your relationship. And you hate drama! Therefore you rather just say "yes dear" and go with whatever she says like a zombie. You do this because you love her and want to make her happy, even though living this way makes you miserable! Then finally something comes along, in this case the car you've always wanted, that makes you finally put your foot down. You realize you take enough shit and do enough for her. So it's time to do something for yourself. I WILL DRIVE THE CAR I WANT TO DRIVE! I can't say I like Dodge Chargers, but I love this commercial because I've always said I will refuse marriage or get divorced before any woman forces me to buy a car I don't want. I will NEVER own a minivan! There are lots of things I will compromise on, but my car is just not one of them. And I don’t care if any women thinks my Ducati is impractical either. My sportbike is like my Bulldog. Both will stay and you will go. I am man. Hear me roar. PS (I secretly loved the Google commercial best of all! It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I guess that makes me a sexist pig with a soft center?)
Sean of the Eff-Stop Local photo blog was taken aback when he noticed this HECKlE &amp; JECKlE'S Chicken Shack sign while tooling around Tacoma, Washington. &nbsp;You may recall Heckle and Jeckle , the mischievous pair of magpies for whom our Chicken Shack owner named his fine restaurant. &nbsp;Perhaps it was in the spirit of these crazy cartoon birds' reckless abandon that the author of the sign chose to write in all capital letters, except, of course, for the lowercase L's. &nbsp;Or maybe it's just as I've always suspected — the world is coming to an end. Yesterday's submission by Randy C. outs Gary Pool as a repeat offender . &nbsp;Today it's a POOL TABlE SAlE. &nbsp;Randy explains: I spotted this one on Niagara Falls Boulevard in Amherst, NY. &nbsp;In the summer this business sells swimming pools and during the winter they turn to indoor entertainment items such as pool tables . Seems that Gary is short on uppercase L's for his readerboard. Trying to get back into the swing of posting more regularly, I was encouraged by Randy C of Cheektowaga, NY, to post more frequently. &nbsp;He tells his tale: I spotted this one on Niagara Falls Boulevard in Amherst, NY, soon after the Buffalo Home and Garden Show. &nbsp;Of secondary interest is the lower case "o" in the word "show." I pass this business three times a week and have gotten so I always check out their sign. &nbsp;Is this just a clever way to get people to notice their business? Just for fun, I've included a second photo to place the sign in context. Not the SPECIAl on this blog. &nbsp;Also reminds me of a&nbsp; POOl &nbsp;or two . SWINE FlU GONE TOO FAR, indeed! &nbsp;Dylan C. from Cairo, NY explained that this was a 12th grader's class assignment. &nbsp;Looks like swine flu &nbsp;is beginning to take a toll on lowercase L judgment ... and education. This is not the first case of FlU we've caught here. Lowercase L errors are usually ephemeral, written on cardboard, scribbled on scrap paper, or arranged with letter tiles on a roadside readerboard. &nbsp;But once in a great while, a lowercase L makes a mark of permanence in the world, and it simply cannot be ignored. Such is the case with the flawed 50-peso coins minted in Chile in 2008 . &nbsp;Surprisingly, no one noticed the misspelled CHIlE until just a few weeks ago. &nbsp;Are people so used to writing lowercase L's among all uppercase letters that everyone thought this was passable? This could be a result of mistaking the uppercase i stamp for an L stamp, or the error could have followed a poorly handwritten note that instructed the Chilean minter to cast the letters CHIlE in metal. &nbsp;Or perhaps there was a conspiracy to inject the market for erroneous coins with fresh material. Either way, this may be bigger than the Manhattan Project incident . Thanks to Adrian Bailey for passing along this news! Lisa B. found this LOBSTER ClAM SAUCE at Moby Dick Restaurant on the wharf in Santa Barbara. Funny that the author almost lost it with the weak uppercase L in SALMON, fully recovered with LOBSTER, and then totally fell apart with the ClAM. It's easy to ignore the lowercase L problem when it doesn't impact our lives in any way other than annoyance or mild confusion. But when someone attacks the family name, it hits too close to home for comfort. That's how Morgan Holzer felt when he read this sign being held by the car service driver at the airport. It reads like a McKenzie Brothers Canadian insult ... Take off, you HOlZER & MORGAN! Yitz Complicated shares this apropos trailer with lowercase L readers, figuring we like this kind of stuff.
Catch the goose... We had our opening night today. Or premiere. Do you call it premiere in English? I'm not sure. Anyway, it was a success. The shot you see I took from where I sit at the piano and I had to shoot from the hip because I had to make sure the audience didn't see me taking the shot. Fun. Party... We had a lot of fun on stage and later had an after show party. We hung out until 4 AM and I was so drunk I could hardly walk home. Water 'n ice... Yuki was at his daycare all day, and I had some time to get my software working. I do have lots and lots of sound libraries and I find it difficult to make them work. The architecture seems different than on my last computer and somehow they're not recognized by my music software. It's long process to get them to work properly. It has been extremely cold in the last days. Siberian cold. The winter just doesn't want to stop. Yuki has a cold again, I think this time he also got an eye infection. Need to go see the doctor. No wonder in this cold... Today we had our last rehearsal. It went well and we're set for tomorrow. Ended the day in a restaurant close to the theatre. I still have an undeveloped film in my Nikon, I'll add the missing pics when they're finished... Almost human... This morning our new CD's arrived. Yeah! A new CD, it's always nice. It's our band's 10th CD. Yuki slept until 10AM, that's 14 hours! After he woke up we went to the zoo where I met Anna Sofie, the costume designer from the theatre. We hung out until 1PM, she feels a bit lonely because she's from Munich and knows nobody here., so I asked her to come to the Zoo with me. After she left Sabina came, we had lunch at the zoo together. I have Yuki all day until 7 when I have to go to the rehearsals again. A long day. First working on the music with Josephine, then off to rehearsals where we tried out our new music, after rehearsalsI changed what didn't work, then went back to the theatre where we had the first of three run through rehearsals before opening night, after rehearsals we had a 2 hour critique with the entire crew, and then finally went to a restaurant for some food and wine. The rehearsal went really well. Joshua watched the play for the first time and liked it very much. I think the opening will be fine. The new music worked perfectly. We were able to incorporate it into the play with only one 2 hour rehearsal, not bad at all... I came home at 2:30 AM, wasted. Pink... A beautiful Sunday with perfect weather for a trip to the Zoo. I had Yuki and we both went there in a good mood. There were millions of people at the zoo. I usually go during the day and the zoo is often nearly empty, but on Sundays it's a nightmare. I'm not used to that... Later I had to work a lot because I had to do last minute adjustments to the music. Tomorrow morning Josephine's coming to my studio and I have to be prepared. We were supposed to have a musical rehearsal today at the theatre, but the whole sound system broke down, so we had to cancel it. This is getting tight now. There's still a lot of additional music we have to try out now that the acting is in place and I wonder when we will do it... It's getting tight. Since I had a lot of free time after the cancellation of the rehearsal, I decided to rip my studio apart and start to setup my new equipment. I know I should wait until after opening night, never should do that kind of stuff in the middle of a project, but I want to finish this as quickly as possible, as I am getting tired of my old studio. It was a nightmare. Millions of cables... But by midnight I was nearly finished and I can tell you: it's fantastic. I threw all of my old studio furniture out, I now have a small, clean table with my new MacBook Pro and the studio monitors on it, very clean, very tidy. Then about 12 Teras of new harddisk power in a cabinet and that's it. Brand new software: Mac OS 10.6.2, Aperture 3, Protools 8, Logic Studio 9, and a lot of positive energy to go along with it. It will take some time to get everything running smoothly, but I'm very optimistic. Rehearsal.. In the morning again rehearsals, then I spent most of the day, as I did yesterday, installing software on my new Mac. It's very time consuming, but well worth the effort. I'll be at the front of the pack again after falling back in the last 2 years. New sounds, new software, new OS. I love Macs, they're the best. Then I composed some new music for the play. Last minute adjustments so to speak. Another world... This morning we had a so called AMA in German, which means "Alles mit Allem", in English "All with all" meaning costumes, light, and makeup. It went pretty well, better than anticipated. We had our wigs for the first time and we locked hilarious. Interesting, most interesting really, was this: As you might remembr our clarinet player Mike has become an orthodox jew. He used to be a catholic, but converted to Judaism 10 years ago. For this rehearsal he had to shave and put on his wig. Within a few minutes all that was "jewish" about him has vanished. The clothes, the skull cap, the beard, the body language, everything. And why? Because it's not real, he's not Jewish. He looked like he looked 15 years ago, a boy from a small village in southern Germany...
A simple method for finding south using nothing but an analog wristwatch and the sun: Hold a watch with 12 o'clock at left. Move your arm so the hour hand points at the sun. The spot halfway between the hour hand and the 12 is south. A few important caveats. First, if you're in the southern hemisphere, you would point 12 o'clock at the sun but still split the difference between 12 and the hour hand for north. Also, if you practice daylight saving time, you should subtract one hour from the hour hand. Use your wristwatch as a compass .

[Lifehacker] A little known school of scholars in southwest India discovered one of the founding principles of modern mathematics hundreds of years before Newton according to new research. Dr George Gheverghese Joseph from The University of Manchester says the 'Kerala School' identified the 'infinite series'- one of the basic components of calculus - in about 1350. The discovery is currently - and wrongly - attributed in books to Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz at the end of the seventeenth centuries. The team from the Universities of Manchester and Exeter reveal the Kerala School also discovered what amounted to the Pi series and used it to calculate Pi correct to 9, 10 and later 17 decimal places. And there is strong circumstantial evidence that the Indians passed on their discoveries to mathematically knowledgeable Jesuit missionaries who visited India during the fifteenth century.

Don’t look at Einstein - it was all done with Newtonian physics. Even though every high school student that has ever taken physics (should) remember Newton’s contributions, not many know about the man behind the science.

IMAX videographer Peter Rubi stands in the foreground as a Discovery Channel videographer interviews DOW driver Herb Stein in the background.  And behind it all?  A wall cloud scraping the ground roughly 60 seconds before forming the first (and only) tornado Vortex 2 intercepted in year one of field operations.  This was shot on June 5, 2009, in Goshen County, Wyoming.The giant retractable antenna on the back of Doppler on Wheels #6 is designed to both loft weather instrumentation high into the air (where ground obstructions do not interfere with it) and to act as a radio repeater for communication between storm researchers. I found this little bit of nostalgia recently while working through the many-years long backlog of old film and slides that I had from my non-digital days; this is one of my first ever storm shots, shot back in 1999 or 2000, back before I took up storm chasing.  Don't remember the exact date on this one; what I do remember is that this was the first time that I really wished I owned a camera with a wider lens, as the arcus cloud in the distance (rapidly approaching Kearney, Nebraska) covered almost the entire sky and looked like something straight out of the end of the world.  The lightning bolt in this shot is pure luck; it happened to strike at the exact moment I pressed the shutter.
Twas the Irish what invented the pipes, you know, and they gave them to the Scots as a joke. And the Scots haven't gotten the joke yet! Chocolate Guinness Cake by Nigella Lawson This cake is magnificent in its damp blackness. I can't say that you can absolutely taste the stout in it, but there is certainly a resonant, ferrous tang which I happen to love. The best way of describing it is to say that it's like gingerbread without the spices. There is enough sugar — a certain understatement here — to counter any potential bitterness of the Guinness, and although I've eaten versions of this made up like a chocolate layer cake, stuffed and slathered in a rich chocolate frosting, I think that can take away from its dark majesty. Besides, I wanted to make a cream cheese frosting to echo the pale head that sits on top of a glass of stout. It's unconventional to add cream but it makes it frothier and lighter which I regard as aesthetically and gastronomically desirable. But it is perfectly acceptable to leave the cake un-iced: in fact, it tastes gorgeous plain. Ingredients for the cake: 1 cup Guinness 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 2 cups superfine sugar 3/4 cup sour cream 2 eggs 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda Ingredients for the topping: 8 oz Philadelphia cream cheese 1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream Nigella's Suggestions: For a simpler dessert, replace the frosting with a light dusting of powered sugar. Preheat the over to 350 F, and butter and line a 9 inch springform pan. Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan, add the butter — in spoons or slices — and heat until the butter's melted, at which time you should whisk in the cocoa and sugar. Beat the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla and then pour into the brown, buttery, beery pan and finally whisk in the flour and baking soda. Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined pan and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake. When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the frosting. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sift over the confectioner's sugar and then beat them both together. Or do this in a processor, putting the unsifted confectioners' sugar in first and blitz to remove lumps before adding the cheese. Add the cream and beat again until it makes a spreadable consistency. Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint.

What an amazing adventure. I'd say we crammed one month into a week as the Snoopy Goes To Cuba tour rolled through Havana. Our little squad of American cartoonists visited with Cuban counterparts at newspapers, animation studios and design schools. We dropped in at Hemingway's house but he wasn't home. We even looked for him at all his favorite bars in downtown Havana but he wasn't there either. The Cuban people couldn't have been sweeter, prompting my new expression: "You don't meet people in Cuba...you fall in love with them." The narrow streets of the city are filled with people (as opposed to cars), not to mention music and dancing. I have never felt so safe walking around in dark alleys at midnight. The poverty and deprivation are obvious everywhere but are not enough to dampen their spirits. These photos include Jeannie Schulz and me with old Havana in the background.
In all my years of reading horror comics I've learned this important fact: corpses are razor sharp, and if you're not careful you can very easily cut yourself on one and start bleeding.

Share it now with the one/s you love (to death.) Hey, how about a second helping of corpse for dinner? Check the THOIA Archive for the Reed Crandell classic--- "The Corpse That Came to Dinner!" ---NEWS FLASH!!--- It's FINALLY coming!

(Stay tuned for pre-order information!) I mentioned filmmaker William Castle in the last THOIA post "Monsters for Rent" because of the gimmick angle to that story (we all know Castle was The Master at goofishly grand gimmicktry), and I'm going to mention him again today too because of the House on Haunted Hill-esque, skeleton-producing, acid pool angle to today's lurid Iger Shop classic.

The last Wally Wood story from the February 1955 issue of This is Suspense #23 (originally presented in the May 1950 issue of A Star Presentation #3 ), PLUS! a Marvel / Atlas story submission from THOIA reader Ben Evans, "The Nightmare Men" by Mac Pakula , originally presented in the June 1957 issue of Strange Tales of the Unusual #10 . Says Ben, "This is more or less what I always interpreted Dream Police by Cheap Trick as being about." Haha, thanks again for the scans Ben! It's strange to think that in all the years of managing THOIA this is only my third Wally Wood post. I assure you this will be rectified throughout 2010. And now the exciting conclusion to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (originally featured in the May 1950 issue of A Star Presentation #3 . ) NEXT: More Wally Wood! But if you can't wait, check the THOIA Archives from May 2008 for-- The Thing from the Sea! While the Feb. '55 issue of This is Suspense #23 is technically the first issue of this short lived series (formerly known as Strange Suspense Stories ) it is also the last pre-code issue. And however you look at it, whether kicking things off big, or the sad end to an "anything goes" era, you certainly can't go wrong with a reprint of Wally Wood's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (originally featured in the May '50 issue of A Star Presentation #3 .) This is definitely not Wood's best work, but it's still tremendous fun seeing him hone his imaginative skill during this phase of his career. (to be continued...) Closing out February with another double header, our first story from the May '74 issue of Tales of the Zombie #5 is a favorite of mine and contains one of the saddest, most chilling endings in any horror story ever. And for you people jonesin' for some damn 50's style pre-code already, I've included the Stan Lee / George Tuska reprint classic "Acid Test!" from the Oct. '73 issue of Tales of the Zombie #2 , (originally presented in the July '53 issue of Menace #5 under the title "Nightmare!")

You can see my last post on the show on Chicago Garden titled Garden Hits and Misses at Chicago Flower and Garden Show . Overall, I really enjoyed the themed gardens and walked away with some good ideas that I hope to incorporate somewhere. One of the highlights of the show was attending the lecture by Anna Pavord, author of Bulb . If you haven't bought or read Bulb you should because it is a wonderful garden book with great information on bulbs. The bulbs range from Amaryllis bulbs to hardy garden bulbs like tulips. I've said before that I liked Bulb because it reads like something written by a gardener who loves bulbs, corms and tubers. My idea of Ms. Pavord as a real bulb-loving gardener was solidified after hearing her lecture. She spoke about bulbs with a passion that can't be faked. Her presentation was filled with bulb recommendations for various growing conditions from her experiences growing these bulbs in her own garden. My&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;anecdote&nbsp;of hers about how her Amaryllis bulb collection was blooming over the holidays and she wished that people would visit, just so that someone besides her would be able to appreciate the blooms. Just how serious of a bulb grower is Ms. Pavord? There were hundreds of tulip bulbs in bloom at the Chicago Flower and Garden Show and she spotted this one among a sea of perfect tulip blooms. This purple and white tulip is "broken" and the coloring is caused by a virus. During the Dutch Tulip Craze , bulbs with dual colorings were highly sought-after and commanded ridiculous prices. This particular bulb gave her an opportunity to talk about the snowdrop craze that is currently sweeping England, where gardeners are paying hundreds of pounds for single bulbs. She told us about parties and gatherings with Brits crawling around gardens on all fours counting spots on the leaves of snowdrops. The snowdrop craze in England won't result in an economic crash, but it is interesting to see how even though we know our history we are perfectly content to repeat it. I can't recommend Bulb enough, and if you are lucky enough to have Ms. Pavord visit your area to promote the book, do yourself a favor and go hear her talk about bulbs. After the presentation I got a chance to sit and talk with her for a few minutes and she even personalized my copy of her book. It reads: "To Mr Brown Thumb- it was good to meet you in Chicago. Happy blogging (&amp; gardening) Best wishes from Anna Pavord." Yes, I got a famous garden author and international best-selling author to address a book to MrBrownThumb . I hope she chuckles over it for years to come, I know I will.&nbsp; Another lecture I attended during the show was about the history of the D. Landreth Seed Company by owner, Barbara Melera.&nbsp;The D. Landreth Seed Company is America's oldest seed house . She sells some really interesting herb, vegetable and flower seeds. If you're an African-American gardener check out the company's African-American Hertiage Collection of seeds . I picked up a few seed packets and some Maris Piper seed potatoes. &nbsp; From the Dutch bulb growers I bought a Eucomis Comosa, a Pineapple Lily with pink to burgandy blooms. The circular corm is for a hardy cyclamen and the smaller one is a Dracunculus vulgaris. Last year I purchased a Voodoo Lily from these guys and it bloomed before it was warm enough to put it outside. The smell that took over the house was horrid. Here is last year's bulb with the original bloom fading and a new one emerging. The greater Chicago cactus &amp; Succulent Society booth, was awesome. I purchased a new Euphorbia obesa. Albuca longipes (bulb in the center) and a Tephrocactus articulatus, on the left.&nbsp; Kedrostris africana, the bulbous plant on the left. Fockea crispa center top and a Cyphostemma juttae (Tree grape) on the left. The green mound in lower half of the center is Selaginella K. Brownii. Did you go to the Chicago Flower and Garden Show?

So, I guess this is the 4th Annual Burpee Seeds post, which probably makes this more of a Burpee Seed Watch by now. In last year’s Burpee Seeds at Home Depot post I pointed out how the Cypress Vine labeled Burpee seeds were what most people call Cardinal Climber. I’ve never grown Cardinal Climber, but I have grown Cypress Vine and it is my absolute favorite climbing vine to grow in the garden. The first time I saw what I know to be Cypress Vine labeled as Cardinal Climber by Burpee I thought it had to be an error, then I thought; “Who am I to question a seed giant like Burpee?” But then I came across these two seed packets at Menards and I was again left scratching my head. I purchased these two packets of Burpee seeds at Menards. The one on the right is packaged as an heirloom and the one on the left is just a regular packet. They're both the same weight and price and seem to use the same photograph. The "heirloom" packet lists Cypress Vine and Cardinal Climber as the common name. I know that common names vary from region to region and from person to person. A Google search for "Cypress Vine" will result in page after pages of results discussing (or picturing) the Cypress Vine I grow . Similarly, a search of Ipomoea quamoclit , the botanical name listed on the heirloom package, will return results for Cypress Vine. Do a search for Cardinal Climber or Ipomoea stoleri or Ipomoea x multifida and you’ll get results for Cardinal Climber, the plant pictured on these two seed packs. Park Seeds sells the vine pictured in these two seed packets as Cardinal Climber Ipomoea x multifida . So, what is up with the Cypress Vine sold by Burpee? Was there a name change that I haven’t been able to find or is this an error on Burpee’s part? I don’t think an error like this would’ve gone unnoticed by gardeners who are sticklers for properly identified plants. To most gardeners this probably doesn’t matter but I’m a seed nerd who likes to know what he’s buying and things like this keep me up at night. Most of my seed purchases are done in local big box garden centers and nurseries since they’re what are conveniently available. Being far more familiar with Home Depot, Menards, WalMart, Kmart and Lowe’s than I usually care to admit , I know there are differences in prices for just about everything. The same can be said for seed packets and if you look, you can save yourself a few cents. Here are two Burpee seeds packets, both for Cosmos Seashells Mix. The seed packet on the right was purchased at Menards where all the seeds were on sale. After the “sale” price was taken into account it came out to $1.07 before taxes. The seed package on the left came from Walmart’s garden center and retailed for $1.00 before taxes. What makes the Cosmos seed packet from Menards more expensive? The bilingual labeling?&nbsp; The pricing was the same at Kmart with Walmart beating both retailers even taken into consideration their "sales." It isn’t just the pricing; the size of the selection varies at these garden centers and nurseries. Kmart’s Burpee seed display is downright pitiful. Home Depot didn’t have their Burpee display out but it is usually a small island. The selection seemed to be larger at Walmart with Menards coming in a second. This is the first year that I visited Lowe’s in my seed buying adventures, and while the display wasn’t as large as Walmart’s or Menards’ the selection looks to be different. They carry the Burpee Signature series, which is a blue seed packet that I’ve never seen before. The varieties of seeds look to be fancier, like the name implies, I couldn’t resist picking up some seed packets of Viola Blackjack. The prices are higher, with no “sale” when I visited, but for premium seeds I don’t mind paying a few cents more. If you’ll be buying Burpee seed at either of these locations visit them all and compare the prices and varieties before making your final selection. Burpee Blacklist? When I discovered I had an interest in gardening the first seed company I became aware of was Burpee. I’m not sure if I made the connection myself or if it was as a result of knowing older gardeners at the time who were from generations of Burpee seed buyers. I came into gardening wanting to be a Burpee costumer.&nbsp; The first seed catalog I ever requested, 12 years ago now, was a Burpee seed catalog. Over the years I’ve requested one off and on. The odd thing is that the darn seed catalog never comes. I don’t know if I have mailman stealing my seed catalogs or if I’m on the seed catalog equivalent of a “No-Fly” list.&nbsp; In January one Email led to another and I ended up exchanging Emails with Kristin Grilli, who is in charge of public relations at Burpee. She couldn’t have been nicer and more accommodating, even offering me the opportunity to speak with George Ball, Chairman of Burpee. In the same Email she informed me that she was going to have a Burpee and Cook’s Garden seed catalog sent out to me and that I would have it by the next week.&nbsp; I know I’m late for the Golden Age of Burpee’s seed catalog, but I wouldn’t be honest if my heart didn’t flutter at the thought of holding a seed catalog that I’ve longed for since I was in my late teens &amp; early twenties. I didn’t take Ms. Grilli up on her offer to interview Mr. Ball because wanted to look through the catalog and do some research first. Every day since that Email I’ve walked out to the mailbox like an old spinster thinking this would be the day a letter from the one that got away would arrive. I even checked the mailbox on Sundays because you never know with Chicago mailmen. It has now been over a month and no sign of the Burpee seed catalog, I’ve waiting 12 years I’m not sure how much more of this I can take. I’m now convinced that I’m on some kind of list for bad gardeners. &nbsp; Seed Starting Tips. Read these previous posts if you're looking for seed starting information and tips. Seed starting in plastic soda bottles Seed starting in plastic baggies Seed starter pots from news paper Home made seed pots Paper tube seed pot holders Update: The morning after I published this post I&nbsp;received a call from Ms Grilli who was calling me to make sure she had my address correct because she was going to overnight me the catalogs that hadn't arrived. Thanks for going through the trouble Ms. Grilli, like I said it wasn't necessary, but I do appreciate it. Here is what came this morning. The Burpee seed catalog, which is more awesome &amp; wet than I could imagine thanks to lazy postal workers, the Cook's Garden seed catalog, a nice catalog with an interesting selection of fruits, veggies and herbs. Finally, The Heronswood catalog which seemed to escape the water/snow damage caused by the mailman throwing the package onto the snowy stairs. On the cover of the Heronswood catalog is a black hellebore ('Onyx Odyssey') that is out of this world. I've been on the Heronswood site before but haven't really paid it much attention, but looking through the catalog I can see I'm going to have to change that. I can't stop drooling over the Heronswood catalog while I wait for the other two to dry out. In the comment of the post Nathan gave his theory as to why the seeds with the Walmart label (above) were less expensive than the ones bought at Menards. He got me curious so I opened the packets of seeds to compare them. Do you see a difference in the quality of the seeds? Chicago Garden MrBrownThumb my blog about indoor & outdoor gardenin.

The links below will be to Amazon where you can purchase them and if you buy them from me I'll get a small commission on the sale. It is a good way of supporting this garden blog if you find it useful. Grow Your Own Drugs and Grow Great Grub: Good garden books for beginner gardeners. Ever since I first visited the medicinal plant garden in Chicago I've wanted to create a garden where I could grow many herbs, annuals and perennials that are used in alternative medicines. The idea of being able to create all-natural remedies from ingredients I'd grow and harvest right in my own garden really appeals to the urban homesteader inside me. It is a shame that with every successive generation we move further and further away from growing pharmacies in our gardens like our ancestors did, heck our grandparents did. When I heard of the BBC Two documentary series, Grow Your Own Drugs , by ethnobotanist James Wong that has him trying natural remedies on members of the public, I wished it aired here in America. It hasn't been picked up or copied by American broadcasters but fortunately his book, Grow Your Own Drugs , is being published in America this month and I've got my hands on a copy of this international best-selling book. Grow Your Own Drugs isn't as nefarious as it sounds, it is all perfectly legal stuff and just teaches you how to use the various healing properties of many plants that you can grow in your own garden. This book is set up like a cook book with a list of ingredient and equipment (mortar and pestle, glass jars-simple things you probably already have) that you'll use often and should have on hand. Nothing seems terribly expensive and can be found at your local home goods store and health foods store. Grow Your Own Drugs teaches you how to make things like teas, creams, lotions, balms, gargles and cough syrups for common ailments from plants you can grow in your garden. It guides you through creating natural remedies for things like digestive disorders, skin complaints, aches &amp; pains and "female problems." The 60+ recipes are easy to follow and most consist of only a handful of ingredients. If you don't have a lot of space for growing the plants that make up the ingredients you stick to growing the Top 10 medicinal herbs and source the others from places like your local farmers market, health food store or a regular grocery store. The last third of the book lists the Top 100 medicinal plants by fruit, vegetables, trees &amp; shrubs, roots, herbs and flowers and leaves. The suggested plants section contains some information on growing but it mostly lists the beneficial properties of the plants and the growing conditions and times of years you could forage for them. With a few exceptions, the majority of these plants are plants you can find in your local garden center or grow from seed. Now that I know that lady's mantle can be made into a salve to stop bleeding in cuts and wounds or to ease itchy skin I'm going to have to stop letting the dogs pee on my plants. Grow Your Own Drugs is a pretty cool book and one I'd recommend to gardeners who would like to dabble with making their own remedies for common ailments or who like to grow productive gardens. It is published in the U.S by Reader's Digest and retails for $19.95 Growing your own food. Grow Great Grub: Organic Food from Small Spaces is Gayla Trail's second book. It is a beautifully produced book on edible gardening, perhaps the most beautifully done book on the subject I've ever seen. Grow Great Grub is filled with information and tips on composting, seed starting, sugges
ions on which vegetables, herbs and edible flowers you should grow, what vegetables, herbs and flowers you should grow based on the site conditions of where you plan on vegetable gardening. There are even recipes to help you prepare dishes so that you use the crops your garden produces. For crafty gardeners or people who aren't afraid of small DIY gardening project Gayla included a few like the upside down tomato container. If you have ever been on the You Grow Girl garden blog or the gardening forum you've no doubt noticed Gayla's trademark graphic design style. The design of Grow Great Grub is very much like that of the garden blog and gardening forum. Curling up with her latest book feels like you're curling up with the You Grow Girl site, without your lap getting hot from the overheating laptop. Grow Great Grub is a beautiful vegetable gardening book filled with good gardening information and inspiring photos that makes vegetable gardening look stylish and affordable to younger gardeners and those of us without huge gardening budgets. This is a great vegetable gardening book for people in urban areas who only have small spaces like balconies, decks, porches or rooftops who want to get into growing some of their own food. It is written in a casual and fun style that new gardeners will be able to relate to and understand. If you want to be an urban farmer or urban homesteader pick up a copy of Grow Great Grub , it is the only vegetable gardening book you'll need for a couple of years. It is published by Clarkson Potter and retails for $19.99 There is some overlap in the plants you can grow for these two books. Buy both of them and you can create a sustainable-themed garden that you can use to feed and heal yourself. Chicago Garden MrBrownThumb my blog about indoor & outdoor gardenin.

Re-publishing of my feed & my original content on another website/blog without my expressed written consent will cause me to release the flying monkeys. http://mrbrownthumb.blogspot.com Earlier this week I was invited by Mike Nowak to be a guest on his Chicago gardening radio show. Being a regular listener of the show I was excited about the opportunity, but really scared. It is a weird feeling to be asked to come around from behind the computer and be "MrBrownThumb" in person. The first time that happened I had the benefit of going in with other garden bloggers and it feeling like someone had my back. Part of the reason I don't like to do it, besides people not asking regularly, is that I'm not sure the "MrBrownThumb" shtick translates outside of blogs and 140 character tweets. So, after being invited to be on the radio show I quickly had to improvise another security blanket to help me cope with the stress. I asked Mike if I could bring my laptop in and perhaps incorporate Twitter into the segment. He agreed and this morning I headed down to the radio station extra early. I got there so early for my segment that I&nbsp; had time sit down to read Waking Up in Eden and was a couple of chapters in when Mike's producer came running into the room I was waiting in and said I was up. The next thing I remember I'm sitting in a studio with a microphone in my face and my fingers tapping at the keys of my laptop posting something on Twitter. Mike introduced me as something to the effect of the King of Twitter (honestly, I can't remember exactly what he said) to which I replied that I was the Court Jester and that Ron Wolford, having way more followers, deserved the title. The rest of the half-hour segment is as much of a blur as how I got into the studio and into the seat but I was fortunate to once again have gardeners who had my back. Several garden bloggers and gardeners on Twitter were listening to the show and they became part of the live radio show. Here is a list of those that tweeted at me during the segment: Xanboni The Yarden&nbsp; Alexander_Roman MySkinnyGarden HoneyCoop UrbanGarden (The King of Horticulture and Social Media) FineDiving Kiss My Aster NSandlin&nbsp; JPirovano TomNTMJ Even some gardeners outside of Chicago were listening. BG_Garden (Ohio) SJones71 (Connecticut) IndoorGarden-er (Washington DC) Get In The Garden (Western NY State) If you're looking for a fun bunch of people to follow on Twitter give these tweeple a follow. If you don't do Twitter visit their Twitter account any way and check out the profile links because many of them are gardeners and bloggers too. My favorite part of the segment was seeing some of them get a kick out of hearing their names said on the radio. Garden Corporate Shill The one part of the show that wasn't a blur was talking about how I like to blog about seed saving and seed starting. Right after that Mike asked me if I had started my seeds yet. I answered that I hadn't because I had yet to check out what the "big box" stores were carrying. I said this right as he was segueing into a commercial for a local garden center that, get this, had their seed supplies ready for customers. Did I really go on "Chicago's Progressive Talk" on a gardening radio show with lots of local gardening sponsors and mention that I shop at "big box" stores? Yes, yes I did. After the show I had almost convinced myself that I hadn't committed such a fabulously idiotic faux pas. I had almost talked myself into believing it hadn't happened but then I checked my phone and saw a message from a gardener who noticed that I gave an unintended shout-out to the "big box" garden centers. At least @TheYarden benefited from hearing about Sid's Greenhouse and said she was going there to shop . Maybe that will balance out my karma. Why I like Twitter&nbsp; I know Twitter isn't for everyone and not everyone will "get it" but I really like it, for now. Besides it being a place where I can get the validation my parents never gave me as a child, I think it is as great place to meet fellow gardeners. As I mentioned on the show; I like how I was able to connect the Cook County Master Gardeners with Renee's Garden and seeing the donation of 500 seed packets she made to them. Twitter made that possible.&nbsp; I hope the interactions that Mike had during his radio show with gardeners on Twitter propel him to add social media into the programing. I know sometimes when I'm listening to him &amp; Beth Botts I feel the urge to chime in but don't feel like picking up the phone. Being able to send a quick question or comment to the show would be great. Plus, there's the ability to tap into a national audience that could be listening online like those gardeners from outside Chicago were doing today. We may not all live in the same gardening Zone but we all speak plants. I'm grateful to Mike and his crew for being so nice and for the opportunity to be on the show. It was scary but it was a lot of fun and now I wish I had a radio show all of my own. :0) You can listen to The Mike Nowak Show on WCPT 820 AM in Chicago on Sunday's from 8-10AM. It is always informative for gardeners and really funny. He has a regular column that runs in Chicagoland Gardening magazine that you should check out. Visit MikeNowak.Net and poke around his website to learn about his articles, lectures and performances. Podcasts of his show can be found here (the February 7th show is the one I'm in). Oh yeah, and support those local advertisers too. Thanks for going on The Mike Nowak Show with me. Chicago Garden MrBrownThumb my blog about indoor & outdoor gardenin.

Over on the www.GardenBloggers.com blog I announced a project called GROW, for active, personal garden blogs. What we'll be doing is gathering a number of garden bloggers within the U.S to grow the same climbing nasturtium seeds provided to us by the online seed catalog, Renee'sGarden. Throughout the growing season the participating garden blogs will be posting updates about the project and sharing their experience and tips growing the same seeds in their garden. The idea behind the GROW project is to create a sense of community among garden bloggers who may only know each other online by getting them to share the same plant. We have a few spaces left, so if you'd like to participate check out http://grow.gardenbloggers.com and read the details about the project and see if you'd like to participate. Unfortunately, space is limited so it is being restricted to active garden blogs, that means garden blogs that are regularly updated. Blogs for or by garden businesses are not&nbsp;eligible&nbsp;at this time because we have a small amount of the nasturtium seeds to distribute to the participating garden bloggers. If you're an active garden blogger and can commit to posting once a month and sharing pictures, video and text about how your plants are growing in your garden don't hesitate to sign up. Curious? Visit http://grow.gardenbloggers.com to read the details and see what garden bloggers are already signed up to participate.

The one that gets the most votes is the "winner" and celebrated all season long and we're giving seeds (for free) of the winner to grow. The seeds for the winning plant are mailed out to everyone in the Chicagoland area who voted and you can plant them in your garden, windowsill, balcony, container garden or a community garden if you don't have land to garden on. This year's candidates are: Bee Balm, Nodding Allium and Purple Coneflower. Visit www.OneSeedChicago.com to familiarize yourself with the three plants up for voting and vote for your favorite. This year three native/prairie plants were chosen to help educate Chicago gardeners about the benefits of growing native and prairie plants in our gardens. Native plants once established require less water, are resistant to diseases and pest and attract beneficial insects to your garden. Last year One Seed Chicago gave away 10 thousand green bean seeds to gardeners and classrooms around Chicago. My nephew's class grew them and I saw how they got him interested in learning about growing food. Recently, I decided that I wanted to become more active in my community and one of the things I wanted to do was help inspire other people the way my nephew was with those bean seeds. I contacted NeighborSpace and volunteered my services and here I am.

A few days after Bulb by Anna Pavord arrived in the mail for me to review I got a copy of Grow Your Own Eat Your Own by Bob Flowerdew. While flipping through the pages I was charmed by the photography, design of the book and food styling for the recipes. Yes, I judge books by their cover and the whole look of the book is a bit of a shock for someone accustomed to the antiseptic (in a good way) design of books and magazines by Martha Stewart or Organic Gardening magazine. While they contain good information and are aesthetically pleasing, it sometimes bothers me to see hand models with perfectly manicured fingernails and oxford shirts in gardening publications. Where was I? Oh, yes. Everything about the garden (farm?) that's pictured in this book would probably give Martha Stewart a heart attack. An old garden gate leaning against a pile of unidentifiable junk, strawberries growing in tire planters, a backyard vineyard planted in white buckets, missing windowpanes, a ladder leaned against the grape arbor that leans against a dilapidated shed. All of these beautifully flawed vignettes would probably be cropped out of photos or not show at all in most garden books and magazines. In Grow Your Own Eat Your Own the largest photos are dedicated to the chaos of a real garden, one that isn't concerned about the way it looks because the purpose of the garden is to grow fresh organic crops. Who is Grow Your Own Eat Your Own for? Gardeners and the latest urban and backyard agriculture enthusiasts. People interested in a sustainable way of life where they're connected to the food they're putting on their table. While you can find many books about growing your own food they only guide you to a certain point. What do you do with the crop you grow so much of you don't know what to do with besides unloading it on your friends and family? And what to do with that crop that doesn't yield you enough to share with your friends and family? How do you keep all of that fresh produce, fresh? Not many gardening books give you practical advice such as; preserving, canning, juicing or give recipes that make the most of the crops your grow, Grow Your Own Eat Your Own does. What I like the most about the ideas for preserving and recipes is that it doesn't look like you need fancy kitchen gadgets and appliances to make the dishes, preserves and deserts suggested. After you've picked out all of the vegetables and fruit trees you want to grow in your garden pick up a copy of Grow Your Own Eat Your Own so you know how to preserve and produce your grew in your garden. I wasn't familiar with Bob Flowerdew before I received a copy of this book, but the book jacket informs me that he is "Britain and Europe's leading organic gardener." With a surname like Flowerdew it probably shouldn't have come as a surprise, but it did. Other books by Mr. Flowerdew of interest to gardeners and backyard farmers include: Bob Flowerdew's Organic Bible , The No-Work Garden and The Gourmet Gardener .

Hello again all, I join you briefly today to discuss a little bit of Internet security. We all know how dangerous the web can be if you are not careful about what you view and download, so we all take the usual precautions and hope for the best. Well, sometimes the best doesn't happen, and you're left with a nasty virus, noisome malware, or some other sort of security vulnerability. Most users are caught unawares by these issues, and when they realize what's going on, they usually don't know what to do. That's why it's good that there are sites like PCThreat.com out there. I got an email about PCThreat.com a while ago, and while honestly I usually ignore such emails, PCThreat.com actually seemed like a useful site. Every day I hear about peoples' computers getting viruses or griding to a halt under adware, and so often do I hear the scared cry of someone who thinks their computer is about to blow up because of all this stuff. Well, I can usually tell them that nothing is going to blow up, but really, however annoying these problems are, they are usually fixable, and most often preventable. That's where PCThreat.com comes in. They have a really good website that outlines a lot of the troublemakers that are out there in the vast tubes of the Internet. I was looking through their list of " Parasites " and came across some interesting things - such as a rouge antispyware programs that seem to be helpful but are actually dangerous malware programs. Ironic eh? And while many skilled users out there will laugh at this, the fact is that many people don't know the good from the bad on the internet, and fall victim to these kinds of scams. PCThreat.com has information on thousands of these sorts programs seeking to cause you harm or violate your privacy. Of course, when you actually have one of these nasty things on your computer, you often don't really care what it is as long as you can get it off as quickly as possible. PCThreat.com again comes in handy here with instructions on how to alleviate your computer's malware ailments. For example, check out their page on the Trojan.Agent.cbdr trojan. They have an excellent description of the infection and also list in simple terms the danger level and the common symptoms (see the sidebar on the page). Very useful indeed. Everyone loves to browse the web, but it is important to remember to do so safely. Check out PCThreat.com and become more educated today. Every so often, as I wander my way through the myriads of blogs in the blogosphere, I stumble across one that strikes me as possessing a certain "something" that sets it apart from the usual monotone self-absorbed blogging world one is exposed to on a daily basis. Other times, that blog happens to stumble upon you! Recently, I was contacted by a very nice teen who happened to be Spanish and wanted to share some bloggings. I checked out his blog and, although it was in Spanish, I liked what I saw (I am actually learning Spanish in school at the moment, and I'm quite enjoying the language). It's a fledgling blog, but I think it has potential, and the fact that the author contacted me was pretty cool (props to you man!). Really, it all kinda reminds me of when I started blogging... I never really thought anyone would take notice of my blog. However, I spoke to some more experienced bloggers, and they helped me out (thanks :) ). Sometimes, all it takes is a link to get a new blog going! Anyways way, check out the site! HERE is a link for the blog in full Spanish, and HERE is one translated w/ Google to English. Note from the Nerd : Gotta love that name too eh? The best start is a good name :D One of the few problems I experienced in my recent fresh install of Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) was the non-functionality of the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard. This problem came as quite the odd surprise, seeing as the keys worked great in 7.04 and 7.10. It has always been puzzling to me that a new release can actually take a step backwards in terms of device compatibility... but what do I know? I don't code it, so it must be harder than it looks. Either way, I soon set out to find a solution for this irksome issue I had on my hands. Who would have guessed that salvation came in the form of a Gentoo wiki page ? Nice eh? Well, if you have explored that link a bit, you may note that it is quite lengthy and perhaps just a tad confusing for the Linux newbie. So... I bring you my simplified version! I have taken only the essential steps that were required to get the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard working. I am sure that the guide works for other keyboards as well. The first step of this process is find the raw scancodes that the kernel spits out and X interprets when a key is pressed. To do this in a nice, simple fasion, issue the following command and press the keys you would like to configure in an order that you can remember: xev | sed -n s/"^.-keycode -\([0-9]\+\).-$"/"keycode \1 = "/p | uniq Close the window when you are done. There should be an out put left that looks somewhat like so: keycode 36 = keycode 144 = keycode 162 = keycode 164 = The first line isn't actually a media key, so just ignore/ delete it. Now, we must set up xmodmap to recognize the keys and assign them their proper keysyms. In your home directory, create a file named .Xmodmap. In this file, you will enter the appropriate keysysm to match the media key. My file ended up looking like this: keycode 162 = XF86AudioPlay keycode 164 = XF86AudioStop keycode 144 = XF86AudioPrev keycode 153 = XF86AudioNext You can find all possible keysyms listed in the following file on Ubuntu: /usr/share/X11/XKeysymDB. This should now all be automatically loaded at startup. If it doesn't... try: /usr/bin/xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap Now that we have the keys properly identified and configured, we can assign them to the actions of our choice. I like to have my keys set up in Amarok, so I set the to their respective functions under Settings > Configure Global Shortcuts. You can also set the keys through gnome by going to System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts. However, in the past, I have noted that this can cause conflict with Amarok, so I usually just leave the keys disabled in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog (Amarok will handle them just fine that way). If all went well, that should get you full support for you mutlimedia keys in Ubuntu and Amarok. If it doesn't work, then take a look around the wiki page... maybe you will find something that fixs the issue or (even better) inspires you to come up with your own hacks and workarounds :D Have fun! Note from the Nerd: Many thanks to the people who contributed to the Gentoo wiki page I have so extensively referenced in this post! Hello all! I start this summer's posting off with a review of the topic that is on everyone's mind... of course... the new Ubuntu release! Or rather, it was on everyone's minds. Seeing as I just didn't have the time to crank out a review during the entire post-release-blog-all-you-can-about-Ubuntu hype fest, I bring you my review now and hope that it reaches just a few of you out there. Let's get started. Installation What can I say, I love Ubuntu installations! As with most previous releases, Hardy Heron comes on a nice LiveCD through which you can dip your toes into Linux and decide whether or not to take the plunge. As for me, I've done my fair share of dabbling, so I tend to just boot up the CD to see if the preliminaries work (wifi, sound, video(ish), etc). With Ubuntu, there is a great probability that a large percentage of your hardware will be detected (if not, as in many cases, all) and configured properly right off the bat. On loading the CD, you have the choice to try the "Try Ubuntu Without Making Any Changes to Your System", go straight to the install, boot normally, check the CD for defects, or test memory. Choosing the "Try Ubuntu Without Making Any Changes to Your System" will get you into the nice LiveCD mode. From there, you can test out your internet connectivity and check and see if your basic hardware has been detected. Clicking the installer icon on the desktop will start the installer. The installer is excellent as usual, and even the unassuming Linux newbie can figure out what to do. Most of the process consists of the standard language/ time/ user/ password setup. The installer also features an assistant to help import your bookmarks and other preferences from older versions of Ubuntu or other operating systems. My favorite part of Ubuntu's installer continues to be the integration of the nice gparted disk partitioner GUI. It really makes a difference seeing how the hard drive is layed out. Other distributions like openSUSE don't have this nice visual aid and can be confusing. Ubuntu really has it figured out. In its entiretity, the install was amazingly simple. The total install time on my AMD 3700+ system was about half an hour (about 10 min of which were spent messing w/ my partition scheme). First Impressions and Usability Usually, this is the time when I grip about how ugly Ubuntu looks... but honestly.. why bother? I can theme it all I like, and quite seriously, Ubuntu has a much more refined look than any other distribution I have ever come across. I'm actually kinda warming up to the whole brown-orange theme. In Hardy Heron especially, I find it to be tastefully done and altogether not all too obtrusive. Ubuntu scores big again on hardware support in Hardy Heron. All my devices worked and required practically zero configuration. The exceptions to this are my wireless connection (rate set at 1MB/s on startup) and the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard. I'll discuss my solutions to these problems in upcoming posts. Media support is great again too. The helpful codec installer gets you all the plugins and codecs you need to jam to your favorite mp3s and ogle at your beloved DVDs. I immediately installed Amarok, seeing as it is the single best media player in existence and greatest thing since pre-compiled kernels (aka good stuff). Not sure what else to say... everything just worked :-) Compiz can be simply enabled after installing the nvidia driver through the restricted driver manager and provides several levels of desktop-effects goodness. Overall Overall, Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron ) is another great release in the Ubuntu line, and surely deserves the prestigious "LTS" (Long Term Support) title that accompanies it. So, this hasn't been quite as inclusive as some of my other reviews, but I'll be churning out a few other posts to explain my fixes for my keyboard and wireless issues. I'll also update the review as I see fit (hoping that some more inspiration will randomly come to me). Hope you enjoyed what I did have :-) I'm slowly getting back into the blogging world, so give me some time to re-adjust. Peace out everyone! And remember, have some fun with Linux this summer! Many moons ago I posted about a fledgling project seeking to provide fully open graphics cards and drivers to the open source community, and consequently the world. After some separation from the tech world, I have come back and note that this wonderful project has made some brilliant strides! In fact, it has come so far as to now offer pre-orders for their first card, the OGD1. The road hasn't been an easy one: The OGD1 design has actually been finished for a couple of months now. In that time, we've been chasing a chick-and-egg problem. We can take all the orders we want, but there's as much as an 8-week lead time between when we place our order for 100 boards and when we get them so that we can test and then ship them. It would be inappropriate to charge our own customers until we ship to them. That leaves us with a $60000 bill to pay before we have any revenue, and that's too much for Andy, Howard, and I to float on our own. We didn't want to make a formal announcement for re-orders until we solved this problem. The card will initially be offered at $1500, with discounts of $100 for the first 100 pre-orders. But who is this card aimed at? Obviously the $1500 price tag is a bit high for the performance offered, so those seeking cutting edge graphics acceleration will have to look elsewhere (Matrox?). Rather, the card is meant for hackers and for those wanting to accelerate the pace of open graphics. We often get inquiries about the use of OGD1 as a graphics card. It can easily-enough function as a graphics card, but for most such uses, it is badly over-priced. On the other hand, OGD1 is very competitively priced as an FPGA development kit. We need to make it clear what OGD1 is and why buying one is an important step for Free Software. Check out the full announcement on the project's mailing list or read a bit @ Kernel Trap . Also, be sure to visit the project's wiki . Everyone loves a good April Fools joke, and this year the BBC came up with one which was quite appealing to the Linux crowd. Since I am particularly partial to penguins, I simply must share this video, be it a week or so old now (live with it, you can never see too many penguins). I'll let the video speak for itself: However, the true geek will want to know how this was made possible. Of course, "CG" can blurt out of anyones mouth, but I'm sure there was more put into this than just computer graphics. So, I went off to stroll the Internet in search of some behind the scenes footage. Well, leave it to BBC to make my search easy, apparently I wasn't the only one asking questions after having seen this vid. Here's some great "making-of" footage: But now, what would a great joke be without a parody on it? Leave it to digg to share the most random stuff on the Internets... I recently found this rather nice Linux-themed "improvement" on the original video: I particularly enjoyed the music on this one. It is well made, almost as though it were always meant to be a Linux commercial. Well, I hope that these penguins have brightened your day as they have mine today (and for that matter the other 5 days I have watched this vid). Recently, my trusty 2GB Corsair Flash Voyager died on me when it's head suddenly popped off as I was attempting to use it. It was one of those moments where your whole life just flashes before your eyes... Ok, so maybe it wasn't that bad, and, like all bad things, this rather tragic incident had a quite enjoyable bright side! Namely, I got to buy a new flash drive! Yes, the nerd inside of me is still alive and kicking. I decided to go with the same brand/ model because it had been so good to me for the years of its service, with one "small" upgrade... 4x times the storage :-) Yup, that is 8GB of flash memory goodness in my pocket. Great stuff really, I got it off the 'egg for just $40! That's how much the 2GB model cost a few years ago! It is really crazy how much flash memory prices have gone down. As one usually is when receiving new hardware/ gadgets, I was rather excited when the drive shipped just 2 days later (I love you newegg). I popped it in my computer and received an interesting surprise. Instead of nautilus opening up, I was greeted by gtkpod. Apparently, the drive was being recognized as a "Digital Audio Player." Annoyed, I set off to find a solution to my problem. Sadly, forums were not much help, but finally I found a post far back in the Ubuntu support forums that quelled my need for an answer. According to Bug #90286 on launch pad, I was not the only one experiencing these issues. Check out the solution @ the Ubuntu forums . That worked for me! Now my drive is recognized as a normal USB disk. I'll include these keywords to aid searchers: Corsair Flash Voyager Recognized as Digital Audio Player IMPORTANT UPDATE: I forgot to mention in my original posting that one of my best friends kindly saved my data for me as my flash drive was dying. Using a complex system of holding the drive in place and quickly maneuvering through "My Computer", she managed to save the most essential of my data. Here's to you! :: CHEERS :: The Asus Eee PC is one of the hottest new "gadgets" making its hype around the internet.

A union in Amsterdam which represents Dutch nurses is saying no to patients who believe sexual services should be part of the standard care. The campaign began after a 24 year old nurse complained of a 42 year old disabled man asking her to provide sexual services that other nurses had actually performed. I guess massive, gigantor balls could become somewhat of a disability. 3. Monday on The View , Jessica Simpson discussed ex John Mayer's revealing Playboy interview about their sex life saying that now she feels like "more men are undressing [her] with their eyes." Jessica, Jessica... is it possible to have more than all? 4. President Obama traveled to Ohio on Monday with Rep. Dennis Kucinich to deliver a health care reform speech and urge lawmakers like Kucinich to pass the current measure. Kucinich had previously been opposed to the current legislation, but after the speech said he would take a closer look at the health care bill. Kucinich then fled up into his tree to finish making cookies. 5. Anna Arrowsmith, a female British porn director of over 300 adult films, is set to run for Parliament in the coming weeks as a Liberal Democrat.

Haim starred in hit movies such as Lucas and The Lost Boys , and a few networks have begun pre -production for a TV movie based on his life. After possessing another person's body to tryout, Haim was disappointed to find he couldn't get cast in that either. 2. Bank of America has announced that they will soon not allow debit card holders to overdraft their accounts. The move is in anticipation of new federal regulations which limit overdraft fees.

They really have become a democracy! High five.
I challenge you to try it. This should stop that kind of nonsense. Want a print?   A couple of toy eye balls.Sir Lawrence Olivey-EyeJust because.Also- My goal this week is to start working on more zombie related images.  You love 'em, I love 'em, so why not take advantage of this situation and make more? Sometimes I get ideas that I need to follow through with, even though I'm not sure why.Materials -  One and a half packages of beef jerky ( I ate the other half ).   12 inches tall.I got him to balance for about a minute at a time. Just long enough to take a few photos.This may be the first jerky sculpture on the internet. I couldn't find any others in a quick search. I found a dried beef dress, but nothing else. If it is the first, then goody for me, and I deserve some kind of prize, like a couple of packages of good beef jerky. Feel free to send me some.Edit Feb. 9 - Thanks to Joe for commenting and leaving this link.  This film was on my mind when I was making this jerky guy.
I didn't have a lot of studio time today, so I looked for a small project I could quickly finish. I'd done the drawing for this painting about 6 months ago, and thought I'd be able to complete the underpainting in the short time available. After about a week, this layer should be dry, and I'll be able to paint the color layer. I think it should be a nice little painting; I'm looking forward to it. Most of the in-progress images I post here are of work on the final color layer, so I thought I'd show a little window into work on the underpainting (above). Here's the completed underpainting: Tomorrow I'll be starting on a very, very fun project. I'll write a quick post about it in the evening. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 6 x 11 inches Actually, this painting is done. I won't post final images of it until it has dried and been varnished. It's probably hard to appreciate with this lower-quality shot, but there's a depth and richness to the color that I'm very pleased with, especially the copper, which has become one of my favorite things to paint. I managed to finish it despite the torrential downpours we got here in Eastern Massachusetts; about 8 inches of rain in the last 48 hours - falling on saturated soil from another recent storm. I now have a nice duck pond where my back yard used to be, and water is flowing freely into my basement. However, so far the pumps have done their job, and it's been more of a nuisance than anything else. Others nearby were far less fortunate... mandatory evacuations, submerged automobiles, and all that. Since I barely slept last night dealing with the water, I'm exhausted; think I'll head off to bed early. More progress, and getting close to the finish. At this point, the biggest thing I need to worry about is anchoring the objects to the surface they're sitting on. Objects which aren't properly painted in relation to their context never feel like they have the proper weight and gravity, and as a result sit awkwardly in the painting. And that, of course, just wouldn't do... I wish you all a great weekend. Jeffrey Hayes Work In Progress 5 x 11 inches Here is further progress on my current painting. I really like the idea of building paintings around 2 opposed and unequal groups of objects. It seems to lend the composition some built-in tension and intrigue. I'm almost tempted to call the painting "Culture Clash" or something similar, though that's probably more amusing to me than it is to most others. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 5 x 11 inches This is the very latest piece I've been working on. I don't ordinarily work on one larger piece immediately after finishing another larger piece, but I'd completed the underpainting for this some months ago, and just wanted to get it done. After this, I'll be working on a very cool project; more on that in a few days. After my recent cancer experience , I got a lot of messages of concern and support, so I thought I'd pass along some good news. Today I had my first physical since then, and overall I'm in very good shape. So... back to work for me; I'd like to finish this one as soon as I can! I haven't mentioned it here in a while, but I have an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter. I'd like to invite everybody who reads this blog to join my Facebook fan page and follow me on Twitter . Thanks!

The wait is over. All across the country, undecided voters have been waiting by their televisions, constantly checking email, listening non-stop to NPR, just to learn which presidential candidate  has earned the Apparent Dip seal of approval. I know how much sway my choice has, believe me, as the author of the world's leading thermochronology themed blog...well, let's just say the responsibility has weighed heavily on my (figurative) shoulders.Apparent Dip is officially endorsing the Obama/Biden ticket. No big surprise perhaps. As someone who reads books, did well in school, and grew up in California, I obviously don't belong to the "real America" I've heard so much about at GOP rallies. I grew up in a decent sized city, which means I lack "small town values" and therefore hate my neighbors, can't stand families, am allergic to hard work, do nothing worthwhile, am a communist, cavort with terrorists, and of course, want America to fail. I am also an elitist because I think issues are complicated and can't always be summed up as one-liners, oh, and I also enjoy reading and non-motorized outdoor activities, which means I am a whiny liberal tree-hugger. Oh, and I don't believe that the term "mothers health" should be put in air quotes or muttered in a snide tone. I care a great deal about my mother's health, and don't consider that an extreme position.On the issues, well, this seems to be a no brainer. I can't think of a single thing that has gone well in the Bush administration, and McCain agreed with Bush 90% of the time. Right now, the university I work at has a football team that has had a rough few years. Really rough, no bowl games, no winning seasons, no big crowds, embarrassing losses, you know what I mean. Much of the blame is laid at the feet of the coach. Would a fan of this team want to replace the coach with someone who thought he did 90% of everything right? Of course not.Add to this the fact that for the first time in my life, I have been inspired by a politician. Now, I don't agree with everything Obama is proposing, and I understand the realities of politics, I know many of his plans will be difficult to enact. They always are. What gives me hope though, is that Obama recognizes and acknowledges that issues are complicated. Obama has even spoken about what a huge problem anti-intellectualism is in America today. Seriously, a politician who isn't pretending to be a doofus. A politician who thinks it is important to be more than a guy "you can have a beer with." You know what guys who you can have a beer with are good for? Having a beer with.On a  serious thermochronology note, McCain and Palin have both made offensively ignorant and anti-scientific statements recently. They both love to rail against government spending on research, even when it is obvious that they have no idea what the research is really for. Remember Palin's rant a
Hey guys, sorry I haven't posted in a while! Rest assured, we'll be back in full force soon. In the meantime, has anyone out there seen this site ? It's totally gruel, by which I mean great + cool. Hey guys! Sorry I haven't posted in a while, but don't worry: With this one, the Short Box is back on track, because it's time to.. LOOK AT MY BOOBS! Ha ha! Not mine, I mean! Wonder Woman's! See, back in the '90s, comic book publishers used to use highly over-sexualized drawings of women to increase sales! Ha ha, can you believe that? Using sex to sell products? That's so wacky! Now that I think of it, they might still be doing it today! But I'm not sure; I haven't read any comics since 1996. Fortunately, I have a stockpile of examples for when I get lonely, and in my experience, one of the worst perpetrators (or worst titillators , ha ha ha!) is Mike Deodato! Some people might remember him from a run on Thor where he insisted on putting Asgardian goddesses in thongs, but he's probably best well known for his work on Wonder Woman , which was even more sexed-up than the standard at the time. But heck, he is the guy who had Dr. Strange "accidentally" astral projecting himself into Elektra's shower once! Ha ha! Get it? He's a dirty old wizard! But anyway, back to Wonder Woman! Don't be fooled by that cover, folks: That might pass for a cleavage shot from Brian Bolland, but it doesn't hold a candle to what you get once you're inside! Oh man! It looks like there's a big arrow pointing between her boobs! That is hysterical! Some of you are no doubt "wondering" (ha ha, get it?) why the Wonder Woman in this comic has red hair and a drooling problem. Well, at this point in "continuity," Diana, the regular Wonder Woman, had been replaced by another Amazon called Artemis. It's sort of like that time that Superman was two guys or Batman was French, and it lasted about as long. As for the drooling, well, I think that was just mandatory. If you ever want to know if you're reading a bad comic from the '90s, just follow the checklist: 1. Lots of hair? Check! 2. Copious amounts of spittle? Check! 3. Shouting about something with tiny feet at least two yards apart? Check! Or you can just look for it on this website! Ha ha! Doing stuff in list format makes it easier to write and easier to read! As you can see, she not only gets Wonder Woman's job, but also her clothes, including a pair of sandals that grant the power of flight and a corset that grants the power to stand with one's shoulder blades totally perpendicular to one's ass. This leaves Diana fighting crime in a fetching ensemble composed of bike shorts, a bra with shoulder buckles, and an entirely new article of clothing I've decided to call Ab Straps . But this issue isn't just about fashion! There's also the hint of a plot to keep things moving along: Artemis is mad at Diana because everyone still thinks of her as Wonder Woman, and so she tries to kill a crime boss and then Diana throws her through a building. That's pretty much it. Oh, except for the part where she's put in tentacle bondage, becuase it just wouldn't be Wonder Woman without that, right? Ha ha! Man! Comics sure were crappy back then, huh? Isn't it hysterical?! And that brings another installment of LOOK AT MY BOOBS to a close, but before we go, since us guys have had some eye candy, here's a little bit.. for the ladies! Ha ha! Crappy comics!!!!! Hey guys! Sorry I haven't posted in a while, but things have been pretty crazy around here lately! Rest assured that we'll be back to our regular posting schedule very soon. In the meantime, here's an idea I had while I was looking over the 93 comments on my post about Wonder Woman wearing a thong. What if from now on, instead of saying something was "cool," we started using the word " Caddyshack " as a universally positive adjective? Ha ha! Wouldn't that be radical? Or should I say... Wouldn't that be Caddyshack ?!?! Rumor has it that back in the day, Brian Doyle Murray and Chevy Chase discussed this same thing happening, and that on a dark night out on the golf course, Chevy sacrificed chances of having an enduring career and a good reputation to make this very thing happen. And now I'm bringing it to you! I know! Sometimes I can't believe how clever and hilarious I am either. But in order for this idea to bring me the mountains of fame that I totally deserve, you guys are going to have to do all the work! Why not start by using it in casual conversation with your friends or in post comments? Then you can email these images to your friends or use them in your sig files on message boards! Isn't that a totally Caddyshack idea you guys?! It's simple visual comedy using found art that EVERYONE can enjoy! Ha ha ha! Check it out! You can use it to express your opinion about baked goods... Or your bowling team... Or even your favorite movie! Ha ha! Isn't that great? You can use it almost everywhere! Just don't use it in reference to Caddyshack 2 because oddly enough, that's not Caddyshack at all. Weird.
Let me break my blogging break to wish all those who start with month when writing their dates, a wonderful Pi Day as March 14 or rather 3 14 represent the first three digits of the mathematical constant Π (pronounced Pi). The British and the rest of us, however, will have our Pi day on 22nd July (22/7) which is apparently a Pi Approximation Day since 22/7 is not the precise value of Pi So, if you're celebrating your Π day today, have precise fun. Looking forward to approximate celebration of Π celebration in July! :) Some angry 'Moroccan' has hacked the Africa Cup of Nations website after Morocco got beaten by Ghana, the hosts, 2-0 on Monday 28th January 2008. The website, www.ghanacan2008.com and below is the screenshot in case they've fixed it now Update: Fixed the url. Thanks Jeff. The website has been restored now. I've also changed the tooltip text on the photo from "ghanacan2008.com hacked by soyapi, on Flickr" to "ghanacan2008.com hacked. Photo by soyapi, on Flickr" :) With that loss, Morocco is now out of the competition. We all know how physical exercises are good for your body. That is equally true with your brain. Regular brain exercises make your brain healthier. That's why newspapers usually include puzzles to help your brain as you relax during a short break at work or after work. I remember playing the cross-number puzzle which features regularly in The Daily Times of Malawi, when I was young. To win the puzzle game, you fill empty boxes with with one digit numbers (1-9) such that vertical, horizontal and diagonal numbers in the inner 4x4 boxes add up to the sums in the bottom and right-most cells - similar to a cross-word puzzle. Every time I saw a copy of the paper, I would write down the puzzle on a piece of paper solve to it later. I spent my childhood days in Chikwawa, south of Blantyre, and I would look forward to reading The Daily Times and solving a new puzzle whenever my father returned from a trip to Blantyre. But when I started using computers, I slowly found myself without pencils or pens and started shifting my reading medium from printed papers to electronic files. That also meant playing less and less of my favourite puzzle game. I'm sure there are lots of you out there who used to solve this or similar puzzle games but no longer do so these days. Maybe you've started playing Freecell or other computer games and puzzles. When I was learning computer programming back in 1998, one thing I really wanted develop was a program to help me play and solve that puzzle game. The program would also be intelligent enough to solve a puzzle for me. I remember starting to code it in dBase IV :) but got distracted and went on to code other things during my free time. If you're one of those who enjoy solving puzzles that involve numbers, I have some good news for you. You can now play that cross number puzzle game, this time online. I have finally developed a web application that will let you play a game or solve one from The Daily Times, or another source, for you at http://soyapi.com/puzzle New button gives you another Puzzle to Solve. Create lets you upload a new game from the Daily Times or any other source. Solve will give give a solution for the puzzle either created or generated using New You can use keyboard arrow keys to navigate through the cells or click on the white cells to enter the numbers. But that's not all. What happens when you see a Puzzle in The Daily Times and want XNumber Puzzle to solve it for you but you're not on a computer with internet access? What if you want a new game to solve on paper but can't find a copy of The Daily Times around? Well, you can go to http://soyapi.com/puzzle/m via your GPRS enabled mobile phone. Since most mobile phones don't support JavaScript, you'll have to play it on paper. And if you care about the technical details, it's not written in dBase IV. Times have changed since '98. I used Ruby on Rails and little bit of good old C. After almost 10 years, I've finally canceled the Cross Number Puzzle Player and Solver on my To Program list. Now get your daily brain exercise. Prescription: 2 puzzles, 3 times a day! One reason I haven't blogged in the last 2 months is because of my other personal software projects. As Dare Obasanjo once put it on his blog description, "Writing Code Will Always Be More Important Than Writing About Code". I'm therefore pleased to announce that SearchWith version 0.4 has been released and is available at Mozilla Addons SearchWith site : (addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2194). SearchWith is search extension for Firefox, Thunderbird and Flock. It allows you group search engines by service (content type) and search from the context (right-click) menu. Apart from big fixes, this version includes improvements to the Addressbar option especially in Thunderbird. Addressbar option now integrates well with Google's Feeling lucky feature. Another enhancement in this version is that when you search with all engines for a particular service, SearchWith will automatically remember to pre-select all engines under that service, by default. To select all engines or change this back, use the Advanced Search dialog which pops up when you hold down the SHIFT key while selecting a search service on the context menu or when you right-click without selecting any text. Thanks to all those who sent comments, suggestions and bugs. I recently had the privilege of holding and playing with Apple's iPhone. Wow, What an experience it was! It was wonderful to play with the device's on-screen keyboard, iTunes' Cover Flow, shifting photo slides, turning the little animal 90 degrees and the like. What I realised after playing with the iPhone is that there is new paradigm of User Interfaces from What You See is What You Get (WYSWYG) to What You See is What You Touch (WYSWYT). Since Graphical User Interfaces came up with Windows Icons Mouse and Pointers (WIMP), it has been fun moving a mouse beside a keyboard and watching something move accordingly on the screen. Although it becomes a simple and wonderful user experience dragging and dropping stuff this way, it requires a lot of getting used to initially. Novice users have to learn some principles of the mouse e.g. it doesn't work if you lift the mouse in the air. To be honest, we can all agree that this is not a perfect user experience because in the real world, if you want to open a door, you don't move around and click some weirdly named device on one side while watching its effects on another. You push or pull the door open. If you want to poke or slap someone, you poke or slap them . As simple as that! At Baobab Health , we have seen how touchscreen systems are so intuitive to users. No one needs a class to learn how to touch a button on the screen; not even in developing countries. I'm therefore excited to see Apple bringing this user experience to the masses with their iPhone and iPod Touch devices. Of course there have been others who developed Touchscreen systems way before Apple. But Apple's design genius and hype production behind their touch devices have opened doors to more simple intuitive and exciting user experiences. Just hope Facebook's touchscreen slap feature won't be as painful. Tim O'Reilly has written a post suggesting a source code version control web service for Google Gears applications. While reading the post, I was reminded of my what I've been asking myself lately when I started porting one of my open source projects from the Desktop platform to the Web. You see, for desktop apps, SourceForge provides open source projects with download services so that users can download and then install your application. But web applications don't need downloading, rather, support for various server-side scripting languages, server side database access, monitoring tools and bandwidth. The requirements are different. For the non-commercials users, the "Sourceforge for Web2.0" can run mandatory ads on every application and impose bandwidth restrictions. You can then allow developers to run their own ads and provide them with monitoring tools so they see for themselves when it's time to go "pro". That should be workable, right? So far, I haven't heard of any service like this. It looks like Amazon is the only well-known company doing something similar with their web services division where they are providing storage and CPU services. But as far as I know, that's only paid for services that don't include hosting various types of databases and scripting languages, or does it? 'cause that would be super cool! WhiteAfrican has been playing African TechCrunch recently covering creative Africans working on cool startups right here in Africa. Some of the interesting innovators covered that I really liked include: Adventures of Nyangi A 3D Adventure game created by a Kenyan game developer who also created the engine that powers the game. (via http://whiteafrican.com/?p=675 ) Peupe A made-in-africa blogging platform by Kenyan-based Multiple Choices (still in beta) via http://whiteafrican.com/?p=658 iblog.co.za Another blogging platform targeting South Africa (via http://whiteafrican.com/?p=404 ) I hope you'll find it :) bwanji.com A Zambian social networking site Akopo A blogging, chat and games platform by Nino Afrikeo An AJAXy homepage creation tool (via http://whiteafrican.com/?p=673 ) In Malawi, the windmill kid William Kamkwamba is still making headlines even at Digg and BoingBoing . Malawi's The Nation Newspaper of 2nd July 2007 also carried a feature article titled Behold, the scientist from Malawi. The same paper carried a programme by ESCOM, Malawi's electricity company, detailing scheduled power outages running the whole week in various areas. Some outages were scheduled from 05:00 to 13:30 and others from 17:45 to 21:00. Innovators like William have huge opportunities in Africa! At TEDGlobal 2007, participants were privileged to listen to great speakers give their well prepared talks in Arusha, Tanzania. And indeed, you'll agree with me when the videos get uploaded on web that they were great talks. The sessions included both 18 minute talks and short 3 minute presentations by a diverse group of speakers including business leaders, artists, activists, engineers, inventors and musicians. Among these was a 3 minute Question and Answer session where the curator Chris Anderson asked William Kamkwamba questions regarding the Windmill he created for his home in Kasungu, Malawi at the age of 14. Through the Questions with photos on the slides, William told his story which made people shed tears and later, give him a big applause and a standing ovation. In the sessions that followed, William's story became the most cited talk among the talks at this conference. Speakers like Ory Okolloh of Kenyan Pundit , journalist Dele Olojede and Noah A. Samara of WorldSpace referred to William Kamkwamba's tale of invention in their sessions. The picture above shows Ory Okolloh who included the photo of William's QnA session with Chris Anderson from the previous day in her slides. Look out for the TED Talk videos from TEDGlobal 2007 when they're uploaded on TED's website .
Reading Bob del Grosso's blog, I saw that fat is a 6th taste . As Bob points out, fat isn't a flavor - it is a taste . I'm reminded of the chart above about Mangalitsa pork, from a Swiss book . There's a nice post here about our Mangalitsa lard . I encourage everyone to compare whatever lard or shortening they've got side-by-side with our Mangalitsa lard, so they can see how superior our stuff is. Besides Foods in Season , Chef Shop is also selling Wooly Pigs brand lard. There's an article about butchery in the Sacramento Bee. It had a quote that stood out: "There are a lot of chefs getting into salumi and curing their own (pork) bellies and curing their own pork jowl, and because of that rising interest in salumi, you have to be fairly adept at butchery," he said. You don't have to be adept at butchery, if you buy your pork from Wooly Pigs . As described in this document , we sell cuts that are ready to be cured, whether by meat processors or chefs. The chef doesn't need to know how to produce a neck or a belly - he just needs to have the money to pay for it. I was talking with Michael Clampffer of Mosefund yesterday and he mentioned that he'd sold some pork to Momofuku, a famous New York City restaurant. I found this blog post that mentioned it : If I had to describe this extra fatty pork, it would be "foie gras pork". If I had to describe Mangalitsa, I'd call it, "pork that's actually worth eating." There's so much hype about pork these days, but most of it isn't worth eating - and that includes "heritage breeds" . The reason Mangalitsa gets so much press is that it tastes fantastic. Other pork doesn't live up to whatever hype it has. Americans are used to ignoring food hype. When something is actually superior, it makes waves. I think the fact that Mangalitsa is incomparably better than all other pork just shows how pathetic pork is now - you'd hope that some other pork would be somewhere close to Mangalitsa in eating quality. Unfortunately for consumers, there's no pork produced in the USA that isn't Mangalitsa that comes close to Mangalitsa in quality. Hopefully Momofuku will serve Mangalitsa again some day. Curemaster Rufus Brown (left) I saw this on the web about Provenance Farms and their Mangalitsa pigs . I got to meet Steve, one of the owners of Provenance Farms , in New Jersey at Mosefund , where he helped to kill, dehair, butcher and process Mangalitsa pigs under the instruction of the guy who trained our processor how to cut pigs, make lardo and Speck and so on . I love the fact that due to the efforts of Wooly Pigs , people across America - from California to Texas to Florida to to Maryland to New Jersey to Massachusetts to Minnesota to Missouri to Washington - are enjoying a new sort of extremely high quality food. I'm very pleased to see non-foodie Americans - the kind who own trucks and live away from the coasts and wear camo - producing this stuff. That tells me that extreme lard-type pork isn't just a fad. Speaking of which - from talking to Rufus, Johnston County Hams is about to finish its first batch of hams, bacon and cured jowl , made from our pork. Mike Sloan and his Mangalitsa lardo The Sausage Debauchery has a post about Mangalitsa lardo . Knight Salumi is about to start making Mangalitsa lardo . I'm going to bet that in 2010 and 2011, American foodies will start to talk about how amazing Mangalitsa lardo is. Pre-sliced Mangalitsa lardo - jalapeno flavor Wooly Pigs has finished its first batch of Mangalitsa lardo. It was made by Swiss Meat &amp; Sausage Company, the company that Christoph and Isabel Wiesner trained . We did four flavors. Inspired by the Wiesners (who export pepperoncini lardo to Japan for sushi), I had Swiss make some jalapeno lardo. I would have done pepperoncini, but I've not had American-made pepperoncini as good as the Italian stuff, and Americans like hotter stuff like jalapeno, so I decided to go for it with jalapeno lardo. It was excellent. The pepper gives the product some "heat". Mangalitsa bellies Swiss Meat can cut Mangalitsa pigs the way they do in Austria, as the photos show. There were no Austrians in the room when they fabricated these parts. It was an entirely American production. People who buy our products and meat are helping to improve America's culinary expertise one bite at a time - because that's what pays for it all. Mangalitsa hams, ready for curing While we were there, a guy who'd bought some feeder pigs from me, Harry Cope, brought one in to have it killed and cut, Austrian-style. He specifically brought his pig to Swiss to get it done that way. He could have gone somewhere closer, but they couldn't cut his pigs that way. If Wooly Pigs and Swiss hadn't taken pig butchery to the next level, he'd be stuck with wasteful Anglo-American butchery . Mangalitsa shoulders, ready for curing In addition to getting hams to cure, Harry will get shoulders, de-ribbed bellies, de-reribbed loins cur curing, fatback for lardo, fat for sausage, soft fat for rendering and leaf fat for leaf lard. Much of that product is going to Mark Sanfilippo - the same Mark Sanfilippo that the Wall St. Journal wrote about , along with Mangalitsa Lardo maker Rey Knight. The fact that Cope/Sanfilippo will get 4 categories of fat - an entirely reasonable thing from a Mangalitsa - isn't normal in America, but makes a lot of sense for a meat processor or a chef. Mangalitsa sirloins Mangalitsa rib-loins So our first batch of lardo finished. It was interesting to see how normal Missourians like the stuff. It was very popular. People immediately got that a little Mangalitsa lardo on a Ritz cracker, or a Mangalitsa lardo sandwich on some sandwich bread, is a fine snack. Slicing it thin - as shown in the picture above - makes it more palatable to people, and really stretches it. I figure we'll have to sell it pre-sliced (a bit like Kraft singles) so that those without rotary slicers can enjoy thinly-sliced lardo. Making lardo requires the butchers to separate the meat from the fat very carefully. Gouges in the fat are undesired, because salt will get trapped in it. The goal is to cleanly separate the fat slab from the meat. It is quite a challenge, because the guy doing the cutting can't see inside the meat. Last Fall, Wooly Pigs sold a lot of Mangalitsa loins. The loins had the fat on them. Some chefs complained that the yields were too low. To get the most out of the loin, they needed to remove the fatback and cure it into lardo. Looking back, I can't believe that we expected them to do that. How are they ever supposed to get any practice doing that sort of cutting and lardo making - especially considering that most American pigs don't have much fat on them, and the fat they have is typically unsuitable for making cured products? I can remember asking slaughterhouses in Washington and Idaho to separate the meat from the fat, so that the fat could be processed. The fact that we wanted special cutting was consistent with the special hogs (very fat, ugly and hairy) - yet they weren't responsive to our needs. The results were a lot of waste. That's why I'm so happy about Swiss Meat - they've taken this stuff seriously. To my knowledge, there's no other slaughterhouse in the USA where you can bring in a pig (Mangalitsa or otherwise), get it killed and cut "European-style" and have them make lardo out of its backfat. It won't surprise me if Swiss kills, cuts and even processes meat-type hogs the way they process Mangalitsa pigs - because right now, there's no other USDA-inspected plant up to the task. Torm Siverson of Pasture Prime Wagyu sent me photos of his first pig . It is astonishingly fat. Must be chefs - look at their shoes. I got an email from Pasture Prime Wagyu 's Torm Siverson about the first pig they killed. They non-butcher humans in the photo are some Florida chefs. The carcass was around 200#. It looks smaller to me in the photos. Torm (r) looking at his work. Given the coloring on the pig, it wouldn't surprise me if it was the cutest piglet in this photo , the little white piggy. Edit: Chef Windus wrote about this pig (and Pasture Prime Wagyu) on his blog . He's got more photos.
I'm getting used to carlessness. As Mark Twain once said , "Be carless in your dress, if you will, but keep a tidy soul." Or something like that. It's all explained here . Today the FTC announced that Lifelock and the Commission settled claims related to the company's advertising. The action may sound serious and of course the press loves to sensationalize these types of stories. The truth, however, is far different than what the newspapers report. Obviously I'm biased, but judge for yourself... The FTC claims that Lifelock deceived the public by guaranteeing that it could protect consumers from identity theft, even though Lifelock's protection is not 100% effective in preventing ID theft, since it fails to stop fraud on existing credit card accounts. According to Illinois state attorney Attorney General Lisa Madigan: “Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do or purchase that will protect you 100 percent from identity theft,” Madigan said. “Don’t be scared into spending your hard earned money.”&nbsp; Now Lifelock has never claimed that it could prevent identity theft with 100% efficacy. What Lifelock has promised, and delivered, is a proactive identity theft protection service backed up by a guarantee that if the service fails (as any security mechanism will at times do), Lifelock will protect the subscriber's time and money by contributing the legal/accounting/forensic work necessary to set the record straight. And Lifelock's guarantee is 100% effective in protecting consumers from loss of time and money due to identity theft. (And no one even bothers filing claims about credit card fraud because the banks already cover those losses for the consumer.) And even if the FTC were right that Lifelock is not 100% effective, does that really mean that the service has no value -- that consumers shouldn't spend their "hard-earned money" on it? That would mean that consumers should never buy ANY security product at all, since nothing is 100% effective. Finally, the FTC thought that Lifelock's claims were too strong because we promised to "prevent" identity theft. And yet "prevention" is the promise of most every security product on the market:&nbsp;According to the Symantec Store , Norton Internt Security&nbsp;" prevents virus-infected emails and instant messages from spreading." According to McAfee , its Host Intrusion Prevention for Desktop product will " prevent loss of confidential data by securing desktops from targeted attacks." Experian (when they're not selling your data) also promises to " prevent fraud." This Google channel partner promises that Postini will "Stop Spam. Prevent Viruses." The truth is that the FTC doesn't care whether consumers need protection from Lifelock's ads. The FTC has clear direction from President Obama to demonstrate its dominion over financial services as he campaigns to establish a consumer protection agency, and so the FTC is prepared to enforce and potentially litigate even in cases they know they can't win. Lifelock understood this, and so even though $12 million is a LOT of money, it's nothing compared to what the lawyers will charge over the next 5 years to successfully defend against an FTC crusade. I'm proud of Lifelock's success, its team, and its technology. I'm a happy subscriber, along with 1.7 million other people. I know of no better way to protect my family from identity theft than Lifelock . &lt;-- Friday Afternoon Nathalie and I were really glad we had decided to stay to the end. Saturday was a great day. Benoit Mandelbrot Score: 4 balloons I had so looked forward to hearing the inventor of fractals. Unfortunately, he did not deliver. He sat back and reflected on all his work, with a lot of jargon and an expectation that the audience was already familiar with chaos theory. George Whitesides Score: 6 balloons The Harvard chemist, whose publications are the most cited in the field, presented a talk on the two kinds of complexity -- emergent and stacked. Emergent complexity arises out of systems with many simple parts interacting and a steady supply of energy (the most prominent example is human life, which emerged from the evolution of competing cells). Stacked complexity -- like the internet -- emerges from exploiting predictably functional parts in systems with more and more layers of functionality (e.g. transistors, ICs, computers, networks). This talk should have preceded Mandelbrot's, which might have then made more sense. Sir Ken Robinson Score: 10 balloons As with Raghava KK's talk, we'd have never guessed beforehand from the speaker's bio or the content that this TED talk would score 10 balloons. But Sir Robinson , whose recent book The Element presents his theories on education, elocuted a summary of those ideas with compelling humor and wit. His primary message is that educators should prioritize the campaign to help students identify and ignite their passions, rather than pushing standard, tedious work. Philip Howard Score: 5 balloons Phil Howard, author of Life Without Lawyers , delivered a rousing rally against litigators. It was very well received (way more than my 5 balloons would suggest) but I think it lacked substance and instead merely tapped into mob psychology. Phil provoked anger at trial lawyers by illustrating examples of trivial litigation. But in my opinion he did not provide a balanced view -- even after cherry picking his examples, I think that they crumbled beneath some critical thought. For example, his flagship example was a schoolteacher he met in the woods one day who complained that she was under legal pressure to reverse her late penalty on a particular student's grade. Furthermore, when she wanted to drive two students to an extracurricular activity, the school prohibited it because of The Lawyers, insisting instead that they use a school bus. Imagine that! How shocking that parents will sue an earnest, hard-working schoolmum for teaching discipline, and prevent her from simply driving a couple of kids to a scholastic opportunity. Those lawyers are OUT OF CONTROL!! I don't know the details of the schoolteacher's case -- Howard did not share them. But I do know that in most of these cases where parents seek legal advocates relating to grades, the situation arose because the student -- usually a child on the autism spectrum -- has some learning difference that warrants accommodations in the classroom (such as extra time for homework). These accommodations are exactly the kind that Temple Gardin and Ken Robinson prescribed to standing ovations, not to mention that such accommodations are legally enforceable under federal law. But sadly, teachers who lack experience with learning disabilities sometimes see these accommodations as unfair, coddling, or inconvenient, and choose to ignore them, forcing the parents to either seek legal help or else watch their children unnecessarily fail at school. As for the school bus, I do not want teachers driving my kids around when a trained, licensed school bus driver is available. Do you? I am all for legal reform but let's approach it with balance and reason, rather than pitchforks and nooses. Anyway, here's the talk so you can decide for yourself... Alan Siegel Score: 9 balloons If by some chance this TED Member's 3-minute talk makes it into a video, watch it! It was a very compelling description of how this guy makes the world better by simplifying complicated forms. The world is too complex, Alan complains, with too much fine print. But instead of organizing a posse like Philip Howard, Alan does something practical -- he redesigns forms to be much simpler. This kind of transparency is not only good for avoiding legal disputes, but it's also good for business. The examples he showed were a clear, streamlined, one-page credit card agreement that every lender should use, and the second was a streamlined, easy-to-understand IRS form that will replace a gobbledygook 9-page notice that millions of taxpayers get today. Adora Svitak Score: 8 balloons Incredibly impressive 12 year old girl talks about her views on education. The content is secondary -- her charm, confidence, and eloquence are eery. John Kasaona Score: 9 balloons For many decades in John's homeland Namibia, the local "poachers" like John's father were prohibited from the wild game preserves ("This Land For Use Only By White Persons" read the signs) at the punishment of death. But the locals had lived alongside the wildlife for millennia, sharing a sustainable ecosystem. Under white rule, the game was hunted for trophy and profit, and the animals dwindled to the point where only 20 lions remained in northwest Namibia. Finally the Prime Minister overruled the colonialists and charged the local poachers with protecting the wildlife. John's father, and later John, were among the newly deputized conservators. According to John, they succeeded in restoring the animal populations, with 60 conservancies now operating across the nation. The program is funded by the newly enabled tourism, with surplus profits funding a thriving new school system. The call to action here was to learn from Namibia's example of how important it is to support the local human populations when trying to conserve ecosystems. James Cameron Score: 8 balloons The director of blockbuster films like Titanic and Avatar shared some great stories about his life and motivations. James described his younger self as an introverted sci-fi nerd who, for lack of access to space, resolved to learn scuba diving after seeing such alien life forms on the Jacques Cousteau programs. This was the inspiration for The Abyss, the first film to feature a character completely rendered by computer graphics. Cameron also confessed that he agreed to direct Titanic solely because he knew he could thus compel the studio to send him down to tour the real thing, which he did in a Russian submersible. It was on that trip, as he remotely controlled a video robot through the wreckage, that he first became interested in virtual agents and avatars. Cameron's message was that the most important ingredient for success -- at least in budding filmmakers -- is imagination. And that's what the world needs now. &lt;= Friday Morning Saturday Morning =&gt; Friday afternoon and evening were packed with official TED talks, TED member talks (3 minutes on stage), and entertainment. I'll cover the major stuff here but there were too many short format talks to cover them all. Raghava KK Score: 10 balloons This was the best full TED talk of the day-- a Slumdog Millionaire tale of an Indian cartoonist's coming of age. The delivery was masterful and funny. Watch it now... Denis Duton Score: 3 balloons Duton is a philosophy professor from New Zealand. The intriguing thesis of his book The Art Instinct is that appreciation for beauty is an evolutionary adaptation -- that we naturally find beauty in things and scenes that support our survival or reproduction. For example, he claims that people naturally prefer landscapes where the trees have low lying branches -- the better for escaping predators. Unfortunately his delivery was not up to TED standards. Marion Bantjes Score: 1 balloon A totally self-absorbed artist shares her doodles. Okay so lots of folks liked her and I'm just a Philistine. Still, ick. Temple Grandin Score: 7 balloons An autistic woman, whose autobiography is the subject of an upcoming film , presented her position on education. Temple has turned her intuitive understanding of animal cognition into a successful career improving slaughterhouses, and now she's preaching the importance of reforming education to accommodate learning differences. Amen! Specifically for kids on the autistic spectrum, schools should integrate mentorships, hands-on activities, and on-the-job internships, so that Asperger's kids can "one day make their way to Silicon Valley." David Rockwell Score: 4 balloons Architect designs innovative playground for kids. Crowd goes wild with sentiment. David Byrne, Thomas Dolby and Ethel Quartet Some great music to ease us in after the break. Natalie Merchant Score: 9 balloons Even after David Byrne, Robert Gupta and Sheryl Crowe, the best musical show of the week was Nathalie Merchant's performance of the classic poems she has put to music in her upcoming album Leave Your Sleep. Here's a nice one... "The Janitor’s Boy," Nathalia Crane (1913-1998) Oh I'm in love with the janitor's boy, And the janitor's boy loves me; He's going to hunt for a desert isle In our geography. A desert isle with spicy trees Somewhere near Sheepshead Bay; A right nice place, just fit for two Where we can live alway. Oh I'm in love with the janitor's boy, He's busy as he can be; And down in the cellar he's making a raft Out of an old settee. He'll carry me off, I know that he will, For his hair is exceedingly red; And the only thing that occurs to me Is to dutifully shiver in bed. The day that we sail, I shall leave this brief note, For my parents I hate to annoy: "I have flown away to an isle in the bay With the janitor's red-haired boy." Julia Sweeney Score: 10 balloons Julia Sweeney , aka "Pat" from SNL, is my heroine for writing and performing her theatrical production Letting Go of God (which you can see on Showtime next week ). In an impromptu 3-minute talk, Julia hopped on stage and recounted the birds-and-bees conversation she just had with her daughter. It was hysterical -- if this makes it into a TED video, watch it. Meanwhile you can check out her debut TED Talk from 2006: Eve Ensler Score: 9 balloons The woman behind The Vagina Monologues presented an outstanding reading from her new book I Am An Emotional Creature: The Secret Lives of Girls Around the World . We heard the tales of two young women -- one in an Asian sweat shop and one who was kidnapped by soldiers in Africa. Again, if this makes it onto video, watch it. Sarah Silverman Score: 4 balloons Silverman performed a stand-up shtick with shock comedy that became the subject of much controversy when Chris Anderson himself tweeted how god-awful she was. Later he deleted the tweet and apologized for sending it, but also apologized to TED for bringing Sarah in the first place. Silverman's supportive bloggers insist that she was simply shaking up the establishment, sticking it to The Man by using the word retarded . Now I'm all for shock comedy, and so I laughed hard at her jokes about poop, hot sex and Jews -- for the most part she met my high expectations. But when she mocked dying, retarded kids, she lost me and most of the room. Less polite audiences would have booed off her the stage, but TED still applauded. Now I'll never criticize a comic for making folks uncomfortable or offending sensibilities, but Silverman hurt a lot of parents in there, and (maybe even worse) the joke just wasn't funny . The controversy has fanned many anti-TED flames in the blogosphere, some of which I'm bound to attract because I admit I didn't laugh at one of Sarah's jokes. Apparently the detractors find TED to be elitist and self-important; we at TED don't produce fresh enough ideas, we take ourselves too seriously, and we're too crusty to get Silverman's sophisticated form of parody. The odd thing is that I only hear this from people who didn't attend TED. Really, who has time for this? The Party As usual TED hosted a Grand Party on that last night, which was okay (chilly, crowded and short on food). But the REAL party erupted, unplanned, in the lobby of the Westin, where Jake the Uke player held court among those of us who speculated that there just might be a repeat of last year's Westin lobby sing-a-long. As the hours passed, TED performers of all kinds must have read their tweets and made their way over, joining the impromptu jam session. Robert Gupta of the LA Philharmonic, the Ethel quartet, Louis the flamenco guitarist, Natalie Merchant, soundtrack composer Carter Burwell on the piano, and others joined the fray, riffing off each other's music and whipping up the crowd. At the pinnacle of the party, Harry Shum of LXD (and the cast of Glee) turned the lobby into a dance spectacle (check out the video below). This performance won't make it into a TED Talk video, but if you want to see it, I'm betting that Friday Night at the Westin has now become a TED institution. &lt;-- Thursday Afternoon Friday Afternoon --&gt
 John Underkoffler Score: 7 balloons Fun demo of the hand-gesture UI developed at MIT Media Labs that Tom Cruise used in Minority Report. Blaise Aguera y Arcas Score: 8 balloons Very cool demo of Microsoft technology that synthesizes photos in the public domain, stitching together a navigable, 3D virtual street view product (without having to dispatch trucks everywhere). Watch it for yourself.... Bill Gates Score: 8 balloons BIll Gates gave a great talk on the landscape of choices facing us in the energy arena. Since renewables are intermittent, and all the batteries on Earth can store only 10 minutes worth of the world's energy usage, we need to make nuclear power work. Tothat end Gates has funded Terrapower, which aims to make fuel out of Uranium 235, which is far more abundant and safer than enriched Uranium 238. Sergey Brin Chris Anderson interviewed Sergey about Google's changing posture toward China (and you can watch it here ). Sergey responded openly about the difficulty of figuring out what is right to do as China enforces political censorship. "Some say I'm naive. That may well be true -- I wouldn't have started a search engine company in 1988 if I wasn't." However, Sergey wimpily dodged Chris' question as to whether Google found evidence that China was behind the cyber attack. Soon after a Googler came on stage to demonstrate the Nexus One, which seemed uncharacteristically commercial for TED, until the end when Chris announced that Sergey brought enough unlocked Nexus Ones for everyone! Really. Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin Score: 7 balloons The co-founders of the Kipps charter schools led what can best be described as a pep rally for educational reform -- low on content and but high on volume and fun. The Kipps schools target underprivileged neighborhoods, and so far their 82 schools are delivering phenomenal results that have raised the high school and college graduation rates to be on par with national averages. George Church Score: 2 balloons This Harvard biologist touched on many interesting topics, but did so incomprehensibly. He defines life as "replicated complexity" and discussed his work synthesizing molecules that somehow "mirror" organic compounds, but can't interact with the wild. Gary Lauder In the best short-format TED Talk so far, Gary Lauder reflects upon how we might organize traffic differently at a time when we care about carbon emissions. &lt;--Thursday Morning Friday Morning --&gt; David Byrne Score: 5 balloons David Byrne of Talking Heads fame gave an interesting talk about the impact of spaces on music -- how the elements of different musical genres can be traced back to the spaces in which that music was performed, or the technical capabilities of the delivery mechanism (e.g. radio, CD, car boom box, iPod). He draws examples from Baroque, Jazz, Choral and other styles, explaining they differ in their allowance of volume changes, key changes, held notes, musical detail and other stylistic effects based on the acoustics of the cathedral, palace room, smokey bar or other venue. Of course he also shared photos of his grungy basement, where he and his buddies first wrote and performed. Nathan Mhyrvold Score: 8 balloons To combat his reputation as patent troll , the former Microsoft CTO talked about his company's facility for invention, such as an optical scanner that can detect malaria by illuminatng hemozoin (waste from the malaria parasite), or a container that can dispense vaccines but keep the remaining ones cool inside -- without power -- for up to 6 months. But he brought his team's most awesome invention to demonstrate on stage; although it may not be the most practical intervention for African malaria, it is surely the coolest: a laser defense system from mosquitoes! Mhyrvold's machine, which we got to examine up close later in the lobby, was made purely of parts bought on eBay. At one of the stage he placed a fish tank with mosquitoes flying around. At the other end, a good 20 yards away, he placed his gizmo that tracks the mosquitoes through long range infra-red cameras, extrapolates their motion in a computer, and then illuminates them each, as they fly, with frickin' laser beams! To keep the demo going they used low energy levels so as not to burn the critters, though of course that's what the machine is built to do (and Nathan brought videos of the buggers smoking up just to prove it works). Even better, they use two different color lasers to distinguish the genders, so they could choose to kill only the infectious females! (I'm guessing no one would mind if they killed all the mosquitoes, but someone thought up a way to hear the difference and it was too cool a feature not to include.) Legion of Extraordinary Dancers I don't normally blog the entertainment, but the LXD are superheroes. Check them out... Mark Roth Score: 8 balloons Cancer researcher Mark Roth presented another candidate for the It-May-Not-Be-Pratical-But-It's-Cool-As-Shit Award. He and his team studies "metabolic flexibility", the phenomenon observed in rare medical cases where people are dead for hours -- usually in frozen conditions -- and then revived when their bodies are warmed. They hypothesized that our bodies may have some agent that can somehow lower our metabolism to the point where, under distress, we can do without oxygen for hours. The concept of inducing suspended animation is not pure science fiction. Human eggs survive up to 50 years inside ovaries, and plant spores can survive up to 250 million years. The number of cases where human beings returned from frozen death states with no heartbeat has inspired the saying, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead." Some of those cases involved industrial accidents in which workers collapsed after exposure to hydrogen sulfide, and were thought to be dead for hours until they were removed from the poisoned air and "woke up". Roth realized that we have trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide in our brains, and so perhaps this is the mystery agent. Early tests on rodents support the hypothesis, successfully "killing" the specimens until they are removed from the hydrogen sulfide chambers. So Roth's team is now in clinical trials with a drug that would place trauma victims in suspended animation for hours until their wounds can be properly treated. Really. Seth Berkley Score: 6 balloons AIDS Researcher Seth Berkley presented some startling statistics on flu pandemics, suggesting that we are likely to soon see another like the one in 1918 that killed 100 million people. Berkley also presented some promising research on a new vaccine to fight AIDS. He presented a great animation developed by XVIVO to illustrate the mechanism by which the memory cells that develop from vaccines can fight the AIDS infection. Stephen Wolfram Score: 8 balloons With Wolfram's characteristic ego, he launched his talk about "the biggest idea of the century" which is, if I understood him, computational complexity. Wolfram has made his career studying emergent complexity, as documented in his humbly titled volume A New Kind of Science. At TED he presented three things: an impressive demonstration of Wolfram Alpha , his web-based front-end to a computational engine; some background on mathematica, his attempt to build a structured, comprehensive computational engine; and his simulation of physical models designed to suss out those that reflect reality (I think he's basically trying to find the grand unification theory of physics through trial and error). Thursday Afternoon --> Thursday morning was a celebration of reason -- my favorite part of the program. Michael Specter 8 (out of 10) balloons Michael Specter is a New Yorker journalist who lambasted the anti-science movement. He wrote the book Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet, and Threatens Our Lives . "Belief in magic instead of science leads to disease and war." With a passion befitting Christopher Hitchens he ripped apart the movements that oppose vaccination, engineered foods and western medicine. "Science is NOT a company." As a laymen he seemed to carry more credibility than those know-it-all scientists, though he wasn't as eloquent as a Dawkins or a Harris. In a 3-minute presentation, Graham Hill (founder of TreeHugger) reflected on a question he had asked himself last year: why couldn't he bring himself to be a vegetarian when it's so much better for his health, the animals, and the planet's climate? "I just couldn't imagine that THIS is the last burger I will ever eat." So he became a Weekday Vegetarian -- an 80/20 solution. He gets most of the benefits of vegetarianism without feeling deprived. Now I normally don't blog the 3 minute presentations, but based on the hallway chatter here at TED, his Weekday Veggie meme has spread very successfully. In another 3-minute diversion, Jim Daly taught us all about carnivorous plants, like the Venus Fly Trap native to North Carolina. These plants are quite beautiful, and one of them is now the basis of medical ant-bacterial research – it has a compound that kills its prey’s bacteria so that the bacteria can’t digest the bug's nutrients before the plant does. Sam Harris 9 balloons For the first time I got to hear Sam Harris, author of The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation ! Sam's talk today attacked the sacred cow belief that science has nothing to say about moral values. Provocative and compelling, he offered up some great examples of how relevant the scientific method is when grappling with serious moral issues of the day such as economic disparities, pollution, and women's rights. He challenged the ethos of cultural relativity -- some behaviors are simply wrong no matter where you grew up, so we must overcome our fear of saying so. “Do we know enough to judge a father whose reaction to his daughter’s rape is to kill her?” He offered lots of examples. Is it right to apply corporal punishment in school (as endorsed by the law in 21 states)? Science can address this question by examining the well being and educational success of the children blessed with such discipline. “ How did we convince ourselves that every culture has a point of view on morality worth considering? The Taliban is ignorant on physics – how is their ignorance on human well being any less obvious?” One example he offered was, in my opinion a bad one. Science can tell us, he said, whether it’s a good idea for people to believe that the evil eye is watching and punishing us for what we say about others. He slipped here, confusing belief and action – we cannot select our beliefs based on what is good for society, lest you invite a demand for theism – despite the utter lack of evidence of for it – simply because it tricks some people into being good on Sundays. His conclusion: “It’s possible for entire cultures to care about the wrong things. Just admitting this will transform our society… we must converge on the most important questions about human life. We must first admit that these questions have answers.” Nicholas Christakis Score 8 balloons Christakis is a Harvard professor of medicine and sociology, and author of Connected. He studies the properties of social networks such as friend counts, centrality (are you in the thick of the social graph or on the fringe), and transitivity (are your friends connected to each other). In his talk he overlaid obesity as a property to analyze, and learned that obesity clusters in the social graph. If your friends are obese, you are 45% more likely to be obese yourself. If your friends’ friends are obese, you’re 25% more likely. Why would obesity cluster? Turns out that that are three reasons: friends are exposed to the same bad food choices based on their environments; friends encourage each other to make the same choices they make (“Let’s have muffins and beer!”); and people tend to befriend others like them. Elizabeth Pisani Score 7 balloons Pisani is an epidemiologist who studies the spread of AIDS in Africa. Her presentation centered on the hidden rationalities behind the choices people make that spread HIV -- kind of like behavioral healthcare. From afar, it’s easy to dismiss the intelligence and well being of junkies and prostitutes, but a closer understanding of their circumstances yields clues as to why they share needles and engage in unprotected sex. In Indonesia, for example, anyone stopped by the police with a needle will be arrested and imprisoned, so addicts have no choice but to share. Prostitutes in that country earn close to $10 per hour, rather than the 30 cents they would other otherwise earn. Pisani’s agenda is to encourage clean needle programs. In the UK, Australia and Netherlands, where clean needles are available, 3% of heroin addicts are HIV+. In New York, Jakarta and Moscow, where they are not available, 50% of heroin addicts are HIV+. Pisani is particularly frustrated by the short-sighted, moralistic arguments against the distribution of condoms and needles, dismissing the notion that they encourage destructive behavior. "Pope Benedict, if you're watching this TED talk: I carry condoms and I NEVER get laid!" Valerie Plame Wilson Score 7 balloons Wilson is an outed CIA agent who worked covertly to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons. She explained why terrorism and accidents will likely lead to catastrophic nuclear explosions, and the Global Zero movement to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. She showed a trailer of the film Countdown to Zero , aired at Sundance and previewed by TED Thursday night. Michael Sandel Score: 7 balloons Sandel is the renowned and dynamic Harvard philosopher, whom I was fortunate to have as my professor for Justice as an undergrad (watch one of his lectures below). To improve the quality of our public debates, he prescribes raising the level of dialogue from the specific issue to a discussion of the fundamental philosophies that underlie the arguments. The example he used was the controversy around Casey Martin's use of a golf cart due to his disability, and the application of Aristotle's philosophy to the question (despite Aristotle's notoriously high golf handicap). The TED talk was entertaining (e.g. mocking Justice Scalia), but it didn't tie together as well as the full lecture presented above, and Sandel was too wimpy to broach the underlying theistic philosophies that underlie arguments against gay marriage, stem cell therapy, and women's rights. Christopher "moot" Poole Score: 6 balloons Founder of 4chan , the immensely popular, anonymous, and often profane chat site. The teenage Poole talks about his accidental fame , and his commitment to preserving privacy on the internet. Kevin Bales Score: 8 balloons This sociology professor founded Free the Slaves , a movement to liberate the 27 million people around the world currently enslaved. Largely an unknown phenomenon, slavery exists in many nations where, for hte most part, bandits kidnap impoverished men, women and children, often under the guise of legitimate employment. I'd have given this guy the TED Prize. Stewart Brand Score: 7 balloons Brand presented the merits of nuclear power, followed by a spirited debate with Mark Jacobson. Nuclear power is clean and doesn't require the huge land resource footprint of solar power (50 square miles per gigawatt) or wind power (250 square miles per gigawatt--although he seems to have forgotten that wind farm land can still be used for agriculture). The debate exposed a lot of numbers and costs, and the answer really boils down to whether you think that nuclear power will inevitably lead to radioactive accidents or the use of nuclear weapons. If so, it's an awful choice but if not then it's a no-brainer. The audience came into the discussion 75% pro-nuclear and exited 65% pro-nuclear. Jane McGonigal Score: 4 balloons Game designer Jane McGonigal asserts that the 3 billion hours per year of computer game play prepares children well for the challenges that face our species. To win today's games, one must face daunting, world-shaking challenges despite awful odds, overcome failure numerous times, and innovate. Nathalie and I topped off the morning enjoying a picnic lunch in the sunshine with Dan Dennett (the world's pre-eminent authority on consciousness) and his wife Susan. Over
He wasn’t particularly funny on the air. He was certainly not what you’d call “hip”. I can’t imagine him dropping acid with Mick Jagger or Janis Joplin. But he was always one of my favorite D.J.’s. Ron Lundy passed away. For most of the 60s and 70s he was the midday man on 77WABC in New York. From there he spent a couple of decades handling that same shift on Stereo 101 WCBS-FM in New York. What Ron Lundy was was infectious . He was so warm, so friendly, so enthusiastic, so genuine that you just felt good listening to him. And if you were down, you just felt better listening to him. It’s hard to describe “Southern Charm” because few people besides ex-presidents have it anymore, but he did. Ron’s appeal crossed over to all ages. Teens and parents alike thought he was talking directly to them . He was your bud, your kindly uncle, that nice neighbor who paid attention to you when your deadbeat husband didn’t. If Ron Lundy had been on WABC during the MAD MEN era Betty might not have resorted to banging that politician to fill her emotional void. As a broadcaster he was impeccable. Blessed with a rich deep voice he could read copy so convincingly that even I wanted to shop at Korvette’s. I never met Ron Lundy. Didn’t even in live in New York. And yet I feel a huge personal loss. He died too young. He should have at least been 77. Or better yet, 101. So long, Luv. Randy Michaels is the CEO of the Tribune Company. Once a major broadcasting and publishing giant (Chicago Tribune, LA Times, etc.), it is now crumbling like a sand castle. And Michaels, who in a similar role with Clear Channel Communication, laid the groundwork for that empire to collapse. So it’s understandable why Tribune would hire a non-newspaper man to oversee their operation in it's most dire time. Anyway, recently he issued an edict to the news director of WGN radio listing 119 words or phrases WGN newscasters were no longer allowed to say. WGN, Chicago is one of the most respected radio stations in America. I can just see it -- "Mr. Michaels, the editor of the Los Angeles Times is on line one. He can't meet payroll." "Call them back! I'm busy with something far more important! Let me see... "pedestrian". We can't have our newscasters say pedestrian." The absurdity continues as Michaels instructed WGN staffers to snitch on each other if they hear one of these dastardly words aired. " Dan, I know you hired me and rescued my family from financial ruin but you said "at risk" on the 5:30 cast so I just sent a text to Randy Michaels." Oh, the morale must be sky high. So here is the complete list. And then to help guide the WGN news staff I've written a couple of examples of how news stories should now sound. What can I say ? I'm a giver. “Flee” meaning “run away” “Good” or “bad” news “Laud” meaning “praise” “Seek” meaning “look for” “Some” meaning “about” “Two to one margin” . . . “Two to one” is a ratio, not a margin. A margin is measured in points. It’s not a ratio. “Yesterday” in a lead sentence “Youth” meaning “child” 5 a.m. in the morning After the break After these commercial messages Aftermath All of you Allegations Alleged Area residents As expected At risk At this point in time Authorities Auto accident Bare naked Behind bars Behind closed doors Behind the podium (you mean lecturn) [sic] Best kept secret Campaign trail Clash with police Close proximity Complete surprise Completely destroyed, completely abolished, completely finished or any other completely redundant use Death toll Definitely possible Diva Down in (location) Down there Dubbaya when you mean double you Everybody (when referring to the audience) Eye Rack or Eye Ran False pretenses Famed Fatal death Fled on foot Folks Giving 110% Going forward Gunman, especially lone gunman Guys Hunnert when you mean hundred Icon In a surprise move In harm’s way In other news In the wake of (unless it’s a boating story) Incarcerated Informed sources say . . .

He underwent that thing that doctors do when they cut you open and the results were not awesome. The gang-of-one armed homo sapien they think did it – Lee Harvey Oswald – tore ass out of the adjacent book depository as men in blue uniforms with responsibility ran after him, giving it somewhere between 109 and 111%. At the moment we have crude pencil doodle details but the innocent-until-proven-guilty murderer is still in close propinquity. According to reliable no-name people with knowledge, the FBI is lending that appendage with an opposable thumb. Mrs. Kennedy, the mammy of all her children is submerged in the dumps as a result of her husband being untimely whacked. You can drain the lizard for two minutes because I won’t be reading any more news until then. -o- Reports from the U.N. in Ee-Ran have Dee-termined U-ranium eff-orts Bee-lieved U-seable are ex-traneous. Meanwhile, fighting has become explosive and by that I mean things have actually gone boom. For retreating Ee-ranian soldiers, their boot heels have been a wandering since they are car and truckless. Many people were in harm’s crosshairs. The corpse count continues to climb but one non-military looky-loo who survived a near-hit said he’s lucky to still be pre-deceased. The end to the bloodshed is possibly definite but for now army guys with fruit salad on their uniforms say bombers will maintain their over fire. Coming up after you flog your bishop Marcie will have weekend weather including details on what could be an ideal storm. -o- Back from a short trip to Phoenix to perform some Dodger duties. Having covered spring training in both Arizona and Florida I greatly prefer the “ Valley of the Radio Shack on every corner ”. More teams in closer proximity. You can spend your vacation going to ballgames not driving hundreds of miles just to see some split squad game or getting lost in “ Deliverance ” country. And the fact that it hailed the first day, that could happen anywhere. Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Glendale. The couple in the next room took the word “ express ” literally. Who says Phoenix has no great theater? A crackling hate-filled performance of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” played nightly in Room 301. (I sided with her, by the way. He doesn’t spend enough time with the kids.) Hooked up with a few buddies – Howard from LA and Mike &amp; Bob from New York. Middle-aged Jews don’t hunt. They go to spring training games and eat less sensibly. Which you pretty much have to since Phoenix is the land of bar food. I don’t think there’s a place in town that doesn’t serve buffalo wings including sushi bars and vegan cafes. There are also gift shops in every restaurant. This is very strange to me. But you can enjoy a hearty breakfast at the Cracker Barrel and still pick out that perfect wedding gift for sis! We dined our first night at the Saddle Ranch Chop House. What really sold us on the place was the décor. They had a mechanical bull! Add attractive women and beers from many lands and there’s no greater entertainment in the west! “Suburban Cowboy”. For middle-aged Jewish guys this was Hooters without the guilt. The Chop House was just one of many fine establishments in the Westgate City Center. It’s as if a developer said, “You know what would look good on this empty field in the middle of friggin’ nowhere? Times Square! And just to give it that real authentic desert touch, let’s put a hockey arena in it!” All that was missing was a guy playing Three Card Monty and another urinating on your shoes and you’d think you were back in the greatest city in the world! Warning: There are freeway cameras that capture you speeding. The fine is a hefty $161.00. I’m told the way to fight it is to claim the person in the photo is not you. Not sure that works in Phoenix. It does in Beverly Hills where most women have different faces then they did two months ago. Good ribs at Famous Dave’s. On Wednesday I got to announce the Dodger game from their spring mecca, Camelback Ranch. It was seen on Prime Ticket in southern California and just my luck, nationwide on the MLB network. What a train wreck… and by that I mean mostly me . First off, I still have an inflamed cornea so I really just have one good eye. I was fine as long as no one hit a ball to left field. I was counting on watching the monitor but because of the glare of the sun I couldn’t see it. They’d be flashing starting line ups on the screen and I’d be merrily talking about something else. Eight years major league experience and viewers must’ve thought I was there because I’d won an auction. Then someone batted out of turn. Well, to be more specific – three players batted out of turn. This never happens. My daughter, Annie said, “How could they screw that up? Isn’t baseball like the only thing they do?” So now I’m on coast-to-coast TV completely confused. Then all the substitutions began and it was like Lucy and Ethel at the candy factory and those chocolates just kept coming down the conveyor belt faster and faster. I may have called a Diamondback pinch runner Diablo Cody, I’m not sure. Steve Lyons, my partner, said in fourteen years of broadcasting this was the hardest game he’s ever had to call. It was surely not my finest hour but still I had a blast. Thanks again to Steve for never saying on the air, “What the hell are you talking about? and the Dodgers for the chance. I look forward to doing another game when runners pass each other on the base paths and a meteor lands on the field. If you do come out for spring training make sure you catch a game at Camelback. Tickets are affordable and new this year: free parking. Would you call that a “ fee nix ”? That’s maybe the only stupid thing I didn’t say during the telecast. “ Happy Ho ur” has two meanings in Phoenix. The standard one (that I took advantage of, downing six drinks in rapid succession after the game) and it’s also code for “ Early Bird Specials ”. The old people who aren’t filed away in Florida are in the Valley of the Sun. And they love their early dinner specials! So if you stop off at a local eatery looking to wet your whistle and order the “ Happy Hour ” special don’t be surprised if they bring you boiled chicken. But you don’t have to be 80 to feel old. Howard and I asked the young desk clerk at the hotel where might we go for a good breakfast (and decorative soaps) and she said at the Westgate there was the “Jimmy Boo-fay ”. What she meant of course was Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville. Face it, folks; we’re all “ wasting away ”. During the flight attendant’s safety instructions on my Southwest trip home she warned that there was no smoking in the lavatories and added, “The fine is $2200. And I’m sure if you were willing to blow that kind of money you would’ve flown Delta.” Later on the flight when they were taking drink orders, the skeesix a row ahead of me actually asked for an Arnold Palmer. I know that’s unbelievable but I saw it with my own one-and-a-half eyes. Now you may think that all I did in Phoenix was eat, drink, and make a jackass of myself on television. Not true. There was so much more! I rented a car, I hosted Dodger Talk, and I got vigorously patted down. What a jealous boyfriend! I was just taking a picture of her on the mechanical bull. I don't know how legit these are but who cares? They're really funny. Every year, English teachers from across the country can submit their collections of actual similes and metaphors found in high school essays. These excerpts are published each year to the amusementof teachers across the country. Here are last year's winners: 1. Her face was a perfect oval, like a circle that had its two sides gently compressed by a thigh Master. 2. His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer without Cling Free. 3. He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it. 4. She grew on him like she was a colony of E.Coli, and he was room-temperature Canadian beef. 5. She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes just before it throws up. 6. Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever. 7. He was as tall as a six-foot, three-inch tree. 8. The revelation that his marriage of 30 years had disintegrated because of his wife's infidelity came as a rude shock, like a surcharge at a formerly surcharge-free ATM machine. 9. The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball wouldn't. 10. McBride fell 12 stories, hitting the pavement like a Hefty bag filled with vegetable soup. 11.

Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze. 13. The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease. 14. Long separated by cruel fate, the star-crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains, one having left Cleveland at 6:36 p.m. traveling at 55 mph, the other fromTopeka at 4:19 p.m. at a speed of 35 mph. 15.

Thanks to toadking.com for the image In 1961 CBS premiered a prime time game show called YOU'RE IN THE PICTURE starring Jackie Gleason. It was not well received. The show next week was unprecedented.

Here are more Friday questions answered. From rockfish: Being in both writing and sports, do you know why sports has rarely translated into a successfully popular TV show? TV tends to shy away from sports-themed shows because they can be way expensive. At some point you need to see the games and that requires crowds, a lot of production, and MONEY. There have been some attempts but they tend to be too costly to justify their ratings. The worse ever was a sitcom on CBS ad
pted from the Jim Bouton book BALL FOUR. They did it as a multi-camera taped show all set in the locker room. You never saw them play. It was insane… but cheap. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS proves you can make a great sports-themed show. I just wish more people watched it. And there have been others. THE WHITE SHADOW for one. I'm sure you can come up with two or three more. M. Shawn wonders: What exactly is the job of a Television Producer? I know what a Director &amp; Writer does, but I'm ignorant to what a Producer does? Unlike in features this is a hazy area. In features a producer puts together the whole package – finds or develops the material, champions the project until the studio greenlights it, hires the director, and cast, manages the budget, and in some cases raises the financing. In television the show runner acts as the overseer of the production and in most cases he is a writer. But then there are the non-writing producers (or “pods”). Here’s where it gets real murky. These are generally former network or studio executives who are given sweet production deals. And studios are now forcing writer/producers to attach themselves to these pods because the studio is paying for these pods. So in many cases these “producers” merely add another level of interference and take part of your profits for the privilege. There’s nothing they do that the writer/producer couldn’t do without them, and has been doing without them very successfully for fifty years. Executive Producer: Tony Soprano. And finally, from YEKIMI: What teacher did you "love" the most...someone in grade school? high school? college? or someone in the industry who may have "taught" you some things you would have never learned anywhere else? The best teacher I ever had was a high school history teacher named David Solkovits. He made the subject come alive and kindled an interest in history I have to this day. Along the way I have been incredibly fortunate to learn the craft of comedy writing from Larry Gelbart (pictured), James L. Brooks, the Charles Brothers, Tom Patchett &amp; Jay Tarses, Gene Reynolds, and Jerry Belson. My directing gurus were James Burrows and David Lee. There’s not a single English teacher I can point to in high school or college who really made a positive impact. But there was a radio newsman named Bruce Anson who taught me more about writing than anyone else. Here’s the post I once did about him. What are you pondering these days? Last week there was some grumbling that I didn't answer enough Friday questions. So this week I'm devoting two days to your questions. More answered manana. Jeff gets it started. We are big Frasier fans, but we just watch whatever show comes on cable. I never read about Roz - although we like her character a lot. Any stories there? First off, Peri Gilpin is the sweetest human being on the planet. That has nothing to do with the story but I wanted to say it anyway. One day during the first season after a runthrough I said she looked very comfortable behind that control board. She said, “Well, my dad was in radio.” Being an old radio guy myself I asked who he was. She was sure I had never heard of him. He died quite a few years ago. Still, I wanted to know. Jim O’Brien. I was floored. I did know Jim O’Brien. He was program director of KHJ in 1969 and I did an audio documentary for college on the station and spent a day interviewing him. He was a great guy. After KHJ he moved to Philadelphia where in addition to radio he started doing TV weather. He died tragically young in a sky diving accident saving a fellow diver whose chute didn’t open. One day on KHJ he filled in on the air and I happened to tape the show. I dug up the tape – it was an old musty reel-to-reel, and gave it to Peri the next day. I knew the sound department could figure a way for her to hear it. She was very touched. A couple of days later at runthrough she thanked me again and said it was the first time she had ever actually heard her father on the radio. She was very little when he died. I have other Peri stories but that’s my favorite. Dan Brown asks: What kind of priority was reality in your scripts? How much emphasis was there in keeping things plausible? My biggest pet peeve now with sitcoms is that even some good shows, such as The Office, defy believability. The other night, Dwight punched out Pam's window and tore up the house with a sledgehammer when asked to retrieve an iPod. Uh, sure.) Even in comedy, shouldn't writers ask themselves: Would this really happen? I can’t speak for that OFFICE episode but personally I think it’s crucial to keep it real (Jesus, I sound like Randy Jackson). On MASH we had medical advisers, on-set nurses, and military advisers just to make sure everything was plausible. And on CHEERS we drank. But the best comedy comes from reality. If you can believe or better yet, identify with behavior the better your chances of laughing. Characters can act irrational, crazy, weird – anything you want, as long as it’s justified. We joke about actors always needing to know their “ motivation ” but they do. Rachel Roberts, a wonderful actress on the old TONY RANDALL SHOW once said to us after a scene in rehearsal: “So what’s my motivation? I’m an out patient?” Yo, dawg, keep it real. Know what I'm sayin'? What’s your question? I try to get to as many as I can. Honest. Really. No, I mean it. So let's switch gears from yesterday and baseball. Spanning the dial to bring you the cheesiest in reality shows, I have uncovered a gem . Many thanks to my daughter Annie for turning me onto this little beauty. RU PAUL’S DRAG RACE on Logo. Logo is the gay network although I think this show is even too gay for them . RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE follows your standard reality competition format with contestants put through various challenges and one getting eliminated every week. Except they’re all drag queens and the grand prize is $25,000, a P.R. firm’s services for a year, and various and sundry drag queen gigs. Not exactly life-changing but certainly enough to warrant these guys humiliating themselves on national television. We get to meet the drag queens in and out of costume. And we see Ru Paul not in drag. That was a first for me. Out of the wig and gowns he looks kinda like the villain in PRINCESS AND THE FROG. The contestants all go by their drag queen names. So Pandora’s Box is pitted against the likes of Jujubee, Raven, and Tatiana. They live together in a house with big steel doors and exposed rivets on the wall. I half-expected to see the Gimp from PULP FICTION chained to the floor. Imagine my disappointment. The first challenge was called “ the Queen is Right ”. It was “ the Price is Right ” except with items drag queens would consider essentials. So they had to guess the price of white tube socks, pepper spray, duct tape, brass knuckles, and a human hair wig. These items were displayed by muscular male Chippendale-type models who were bare-chested except for neck ties, The winner got to call his mother. I swear, I’m not making this up. Then they all had to play the “Snatch Game ”. Gene Rayburn is rolling over in his grave. The queens were expected to impersonate a celebrity of their choice – complete with costume and make up of course. So they went as Carol Channing, Beyonce, Pink, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Whitney Houston (the Bobby Brown Whitney, not Clive Davis version), and Ru Paul. The 200 pound man who did Carol Channing was a riot and the guy who did Britney looked so authentic he could actually pass for Britney Spears until he got out of a car. They had to answer “ Match Game ” type questions like “ Slutty Sally was so slutty, when she rode on a disco stick she …” Everything about this show just screams class. Then there was a runway competition. One by one these bruisers came out in flamboyant ridiculous gowns, cat suits, and Jackie Kennedy outfits. The bottom two were selected and to help Ru Paul make his final decision they had to “Lip Sync For Your Life”. Cat woman stripped down to bra and panties and did cartwheels with such force the stage almost collapsed. He proved to be the loser as Ru Paul delivered the soon to be famous catch-phrase, “ Sashay away !” And my favorite moment – this is what got me hooked – Ru Paul asks one of the drag queens, “Where did you get your sense of humor from?” to which he replies, “My father passed away.” That’s it. I’m setting my DVR for a season pass right now. RU PAUL’S DRAG RACE. For good delicious jaw dropping entertainment you gotta check it out, “Squirrel friends”.
Last week, Hard Assets Investor published another one of my articles . In it, I compared the correlations between several energy ETFs and the prices of commodities they are tracking. The takeaway message is that, for the most part, ETFs do a bad job tracking commodities prices. There are a few reasons for this. The first, and primary reason why the correlation is less than perfect, is that the front-month futures contract for every commodity is constantly changing. Since most ETFs hold only the front-month contract, this means that sometime before expiration, the fund must sell its holding of one (soon to expire) contract and then purchase another (soon to be front-month) contract. There is almost always a significant discrepency between the two prices, particularly if it's a commodity that doesn't deliver every month. Take a look at the futures chains on the CME group website for crude oil , gold , and corn . As of writing, the difference between the front month and second month contract is about 40¢, $1, and 10¢, respectively. That may not seem like much, but that price difference represents a pure loss in the value of the fund with every roll that takes place. Just to prevent declines, the fund would, on average, have to be increasing in value between 1 and 5% a month. That means that, depending on the commodity and the fund, a monthly percentage increase, if not sufficiently high, may actually mean you're losing money. The second problem with ETFs is that they create a secondary market on top of what is already a volatile market in its own right. And, while the underlying instruments are the same for both, (futures contracts) the factors driving the supply and demand may be drastically different. For example, while natural gas might be moving up on strong demand resulting from a particular weather forecast , if the primary participants are energy hedgers, no such demand would exist for UNG, the world's biggest natural gas etf. As such, UNG might theoretically follow the price of gas with something of a lag, rather than actually track the price in real time. Don't take my word for it, take a look at this graph comparing oil price movements with the price of USO, the world's biggest crude oil ETF, over the last four years: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full Crude vs USO chart at Wikinvest Now, you might be saying "those charts seem to follow each other reasonably well" but that's the problem. Reasonably well isn't good enough. An investor buying a share or shares in a commodity ETF that puportedly tracks the price of a commodity wants her investment to actually do just that, not merely track the price "reasonably well". It's true that there are some ETFs, especially those dealing with precious metals, that eliminate the problem of the roll yield altogether simply by buying and hoarding the commodity in question and storing it in a vault somewhere; no futures contracts required. While certainly effective in mitigating the problem, this only works for a very specific subset of commodities that do not have a cliff for their usefulness. Other than those few cases, in general, the moral is that if you really, truly want exposure to commodities, don't waste your time with an ETF. As they stand, very few of them can be relied upon to achieve their goals. Though that may change in the future, for now, your best bet is get into the futures market directly. Last week, a couple of the major commodities exchanges announced the addition of some new futures contracts to help producers and consumers of raw goods hedge their expenses, and simultaneously give commodities traders three more reasons to develop stress-related ulcers. First, across the pond, the world's foremost metals market, the London Metal Exchange (LME) yesterday opened trading of cobalt and molybdenum futures. In shocking concordance with my previous post about the emerging need for a lithium futures contract , the cobalt contract is designed specifically with battery manufacturers in mind, cobalt being a major input to rechargeable batteries in things like laptops and cellphones. Molybdenum, which I had never heard of before this Wall Street Journal article , is apparently used in the production of stainless steel. Meanwhile, here in the States, the ever-growing Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it will be adding a contract for distiller's dried grain (DDG), a by-product of corn ethanol production. This is interesting because, with the addition of the contract, which will begin trading in April, ethanol producers can now effectively hedge every step of their production. For example, before the harvest you might buy a corn contract so as to protect yourself from unexpected price swings at your local grain elevator. Then, once you've got your corn and begin distilling ethanol, you can sell both a DDG and ethanol contract to lock in prices for your two resultant byproducts. Further, you can buy or sell oil, gas, or natural gas contracts to take advantage of spread deviations between the fuels. This is also interesting because the DDG contract may become a major hedge-staple for corporations that produce ethanol for non-fuel purposes... you know, like Jack Daniel's. The government, and now the private markets, are conspiring to make ethanol a real and viable energy source with plenty of economic safegaurds. A bizarre reaction to these announcements is concern that opening these contracts to the public will increase volatility in the prices of the commodities and could potentially drive them too far one way or the other. Yes, that is true, prices will become more volatile... but only for the traders. The hedgers (people producing and consuming ethanol) actually need volatility to protect themselves from things like price-fixing and sudden, unexpected swings. Without and open public market, there's no way to plan for and predict what DDG would and will cost. Also, hedgers are not entering and exiting positions over and over to make a quick buck, they are locking prices in, exiting positions, and taking the difference as market protection. As per my post last night , and today's news on housing starts , I certainly ought to eat a little crow; according to the Census Bureau, January housing starts were up from December, as well as January 2009. Specifically, according to the Bureau's report : Privately-owned housing starts in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591,000. This is 2.8 percent (±11.5%) above the revised December estimate of 575,000 and is 21.1 percent (±12.3%) above the January 2009 rate of 488,000. So yes, it appears I was wrong with my initial assessment and the housing market indeed showed signs of picking up in January, potentially contributing to the Lumber run-up of the last month. However, the actual meaning of the housing start increase is slightly more complicated than the above quoted numbers and, I would make the case, much less meaningful than reports are making it out to be. Let me explain. First, regarding the meaning of the number itself, the 2.8% increase in housing starts is an increase in the seasonally adjusted housing start rate . Because the US Housing market is highly seasonal (i.e. more building projects begin in the spring and summer months) examining trends on a purely month to month basis is not meaningful when analyzing long-term trends. Housing starts will almost always go up in March, and they will almost always go down in October. As such, the US Census Bureau developed a statistical method called X12 (and its predecessor X11) used to remove the expected seasonal effects of this type of data. The best article I could find describing the algorithm is, oddly enough, on an old Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas webpage , but suffice to say the algorithm is designed to remove expected seasonal effects for a given data series, thereby showing the actual overarching trend. Thus, the published number is a point estimate for what the current annual housing start rate is; in this case, 591,000 housing units started per year. As with any statistical analysis, there is a margin of error to that point estimate, and the margin is given right in the reporting sentence. "This is 2.8 percent (±11.5%) above the revised December estimates..." Wait a minute, 2.8% ±11.5%? That should give us a range of –8.7% to +14.3% and, if I'm not mistaken, –8.7 ≤ 0 ≤ 14.3. As any statistician can tell you, a confidence range that includes zero is not statistically significant at all. And the Census Bureau uses a 90% confidence interval in their calculations, so it's not as though they're being overly conservative with their estimates and confidence ranges. In other words, this number is fundamentally meaningless. In fact, if you actually bothered to read the report (as apparently no one in the media did) you'd see that the "±11.5%" figure is asterisked with a footnote that reads as follows: "90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero. " So, in other words, there is no evidence that there was a change in the seasonally adjusted rate WHATSOEVER. This number is meaningless. Moving on, despite the lack of evidence for a month over month change, the increase in rate from January last to now does appear to be truly significant, with a confidence interval of 21.1 percent ±12.3% (between 8.8% and 33.4%) for the change from January 2009's seasonally adjusted rate. (Note that that range does not cross zero.) The report also lists the raw housing start numbers (those that haven't been seasonally adjusted). Here are the highlights (all numbers pulled from the aforementioned report): 2008 Year in full: 905,500 2009 Year in full: 554,500 January 2009: 31,900 November 2009: 42,300 December 2009: 37,100 January 2010: 37,800 The takeaway from all of this is that the housing market has improved significantly since 2009. In fact, using either the December or January estimate for the seasonally adjusted housing start rate yields a significant improvement over the 2009 total figure. However, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that any further progress has been made over the last two or three months, the numbers (both seasonally adjusted and raw) do not demonstrate sufficient statistical significance to draw that conclusion. Starker still, is that the market today remains at about 65% of where it was in 2008. How did the Lumber market today respond to all this? Somehow, despite the hype, prices moved mostly sideways; either this information was already priced in, or it doesn't really exist. Full Disclosure: As of writing, author is short May 2010 Lumber (LBK10) Today's Wall Street Journal ran a great article on the recent surge in Lumber prices. (Though, sadly, the online version's headline was changed from the print's pun-tastic "Builders Nailed by Lumber Prices" to the infinitely more boring "High Lumber Prices Threaten Housing Market".) The article does a fantastic job explaining the why's behind the recent insane price movements in the lumber market, which I have discussed at length in a previous post . In that post I laid out my then somewhat limited understanding of the reasons for lumber's price increase, which the WSJ article largely confirms and significantly expands upon. Basically, here's what happened: Due to a dramatic falloff in demand, largely the result of a depressed housing market, lumber mills and loggers have significantly decreased production. According to the WSJ article, lumber output fell 45% (!!!) between 2005 and 2009. As the housing market remained stagnant, lumber wholesalers saw no need to maintain large inventories throughout 2009, further disincentivizing output from loggers and mills. Because of the lack of demand and low prices, several lumber mills have indefinitely shuttered. This, of course, in itself drove prices higher. The article specifically mentions Canfor Corporation, a Vancouver-based producer responsible for half a percent of total North American lumber output, who indefinitely ceased operation on January 5th 2010 as one of the major mills to shut down amid the sluggish market. Annually, home builders restock their lumber supplies in January and February in anticipation of the upcoming spring building season. As supply was already incredibly tight and production was being scaled back across the board, wholesale buying triggered a supply shock up the chain, sending prices higher. Additionally, some firms continued buying on anticipation of consumers taking advantage of the federal home-buying tax credit before it expires. As the industry was not in any place to suddenly ramp up production, the market created something of a feedback loop, driving prices higher from January through to today. Exacerbating the problem is that shuttered/suspended mills do not have the capital (or guarantee of near-term capital) to quickly start up operations again. What is perhaps most interesting about this is that everyone seems to be in agreement that the surge is entirely supply driven. To the question of demand, the article says the following: "The supply crunch is striking because, just a few years ago, the North American lumber industry was able to supply enough wood to start more than two million homes a year. That was nearly four times the pace of home starts in December." In other words, home-building demand hasn't simply petered out, it's fallen off 75%, and still, the price goes up purely as supply stays tight. But perhaps the most interesting quote, in my mind anyway, comes towards the end of the article, in a discussion of near-term production prospects: "The ongoing recession will keep production light, said Matt Layman... who called this the only sustained supply-driven rally he has seen in 30 years of trading lumber." Thirty years is a long time, and Mr. Layman's quote only serves to highlight just how strange this market rally seems on the surface. My readers already know that I'm bearish on Lumber, but honestly, everything about this rally seems crazy to me. At least now we understand the circumstances that pushed prices high in the first place, but for this kind of rally to be sustained... I'm just not sure what it would take short of a spectacular resurgence in the housing industry. Tomorrow, the US Census Bureau will announce the figures for January housing starts. A slight bump will be good news for the lumber bulls, a downtick could mean the beginning of the rally's end. I'll put a post up as soon as we see what happens, and what it's immediate effect may be. Sorry about the dearth of posts lately, but I've been out of town. Speaking of... I just got back from a trip to beautiful Whitefish Montana. If you're a skier and/or outdoor enthusiast, I can't recommend the city highly enough. On the train ride out there, I ended up having dinner with a couple of Montanans who own and work a farm on the eastern edge of the state. We got to talking and I asked them what they raise, to which the response came from the husband: "Durum wheat, peas, and chickpeas." On hearing the word wheat, my interest was piqued, so I asked: "I'm curious, do you ever use futures contracts to hedge your crops?" To which he jumped into a very long, very interesting discussion about the commodities markets. The short answer to my question was no, because there is no durum wheat futures contract, he doesn't really have the option to hedge in the commodities markets, however, he can often lock prices in advance with individually agreed upon "forward" agreements with grain purchasers, though he admitted that this is not as useful as a true futures contract because there is less liquidity in the market. "If you can't deliver your full crop," he said "you'd better have the cash". Following this conversation, the man's wife asked me: "How do you know so much about wheat?" I explained that I was a commodities investor and sometime analyst, to which she said, "Wow, because you sound exactly like our son." "What does your son do?" "He's a wheat farmer." The commodities markets have always fascinated me because, in some sense, it is one of the last, pure markets in the country. When you put a bid in for a commodity like wheat, you're not betting on
earnings reports or interest rates, CEO scandals, cash flow statement readjustments, corporate lawsuits, etc. etc. You are simply betting on the price of a bushel of wheat. It is one of the few places in the world of business where the Montana Farmer and Wall Street Analyst are not just peers, but equal experts, and it is a market that is open to EVERYONE. If that doesn't stir your inner capitalist, I don't know what would. By bearish, of course, I mean pessimistic. In other words, I expect the price to go down. Here's a chart of Lumber futures prices over the last month: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full FUTURE:LB00 chart at Wikinvest Of particular interest is the big upward movement starting on January 28th. Between then and this last Friday, lumber TWICE went up the session limit of $10 / thousand board feet (mBF). At the beginning of the month, I was bearish on Lumber because I suspected housing starts have not actually increased whatsoever (and at the time I took a short position, only to be stopped out in accordance with my personal trading philosophy ), however, now I am even more bearish because I don't think this pricing run up either makes sense or is in any way sustainable. Quick background about the market, the random length lumber futures contract (what most people mean when they say "lumber") is used extensively by lumber industry participants, that is timber harvesters and construction companies, to hedge against erratic price movements in the cash market (the price you get at your local mill on any given day). The biggest factor affecting lumber prices is the US housing market. When the housing market is booming, lumber skyrockets. When home construction is depressed, so too the lumber market. There is very little else driving lumber prices, as most of the lumber we use is grown domestically, we export almost none of it, and what lumber we do import comes almost exclusively from Canada. Now that that's out of the way... a recent article from Reuters basically comes to the following conclusions as to why the price has shot up: There are fewer mills currently in operation (many had closed down when the housing market dried up), creating a minor supply shock in the cash market and sending prices up. There is an expected increase in demand as the result of the approaching "Spring building season". A "realtor survey" showed pending home sales were up 1% in December. My reason for being bearish on Lumber right now is that I believe there is a logical fallacy at play in the market. Follow me here on this treatise: If the housing market picks up (i.e. demand increases) Lumber inventories (i.e. supply) should be pressured and may diminish. If inventories stay the same or diminish The price should go up. This is basic supply and demand, but I've made each bullet cascading to point out the conditional nature of how the market, in theory, responds. The other way for the price to go up would be as follows: If lumber inventories diminish (i.e. supply decreases) If the housing market moves sideways or picks up (i.e. demand stays the same or increases) The price should go up. Note the difference between the two cases. In the first, demand is the driving conditional; in the second, supply. Also note, and this is what's important, that demand, and demand alone, has an effect on the other predictive variable in the equation. That is to say, when demand changes, there is NECESSARILY an effect upon the supply. (Yes, I know, it's possible that demand has been perfectly predicted and supplies tailored to meet the expected demand, but this is incredibly unlikely in a market based upon a fungible commodity such as Lumber.) When supply decreases, on the other hand, there is by no means any necessary or expected response in demand. Demand could stay the same, demand could increase, demand could decrease. There's simply no way to know, or even extrapolate, based on supply alone. What we have in the lumber market is the second scenario. Supplies seem to be diminishing because of the drawdown in milling operations. However, that in and of itself, in theory anyway, should not cause the price to go up. For that to happen, we'd need to see that demand has at least not diminished, or at best , has increased . If this were the other way around, if we knew that demand really was increasing, we could infer that supply was likely to decline, and the facts about the mill drawdowns would confirm this, and we could say that yes, indeed, lumber prices ought to go up. However, we cannot say that demand for lumber is increasing, we can only say that supply looks like it might be decreasing, and there is at best a possibility that demand is on the rise, depending on how much faith you put in a self-reported survey from an industry with a financial incentive to make itself look healthy. As for the "spring building season" mentioned in the Reuters article, it's important to note that this is buying by retail lumber dealers in anticipation of the season. This is not a construction company buying lumber to build a house. Unless that lumber is actually used, it will just sit on the shelf, delaying future orders and adding to the supply. Of course, we can talk about what a market should or shouldn't do in theory, about what's the right or wrong expected price movement based on any set of information, but the truth is that a market cannot be right or wrong. A market simply is. Lumber is trading at over $270 / mBf because someone was willing to buy a contract at that price, and someone was willing to sell. However, while the market itself cannot be wrong, the participants in the market can be. Extrapolating that supply is decreasing based on mill slow-down is an assumption, and it can be incorrect. Believing the housing market is picking up is an assumption, and it too can be incorrect. If two people, a buyer and a seller, have the same incorrect assumptions, the price they agree on will force the market in a particular direction, and this will happen regardless of the assumptions' validity. Now, this buyer and this seller, they might be right. It might be the case that lumber supply is falling, and that demand is picking back up, but personally, I don't think so. I don't think the housing market is picking up, and I don't think supplies are in any way close to depleted enough to cause a significant shortage. Housing starts declined in December, you can read the reports on the Random Lengths website (a sort of trade-mag for the lumber industry); do we have any reason beyond the above "realtor survey" to believe they have increased since? Again, maybe. Maybe I'm wrong about this, it's very possible, but I simply don't see housing starts increasing enough to justify this price run up. Again, I could be wrong. I could be dead wrong and the US housing market might be ready to explode and the decline in mill output might cause a serious supply shock, but even so, in closing, let me drop a little perspective. The last time lumber was consistently trading above $260 / mBF was May - August 2007. Between then and now, it broke the $260 barrier only one other time: August 2008. As I discussed in a prior post , whatever the natural gas market is the other nine months of the year, during the winter it's an inverse thermometer for the Eastern seaboard. Take a look at these natural gas headlines for the last month from the Wall Street Journal: 1/6/2010 - Cold Weather Heats up Natural Gas, OJ Markets 1/15/2010 - Natural Gas, off 2.5%, Falls on Mild Forecast 1/23/2010 - Chilly Forecasts Lift Natural Gas 1/27/2010 - Natural Gas Falls on Milder Forecasts 2/1/2010 - Elements Hold Down Natural Gas - 2/2/2010 - Cold Weather Boosts Natural Gas Couple things to notice here, the first is that the 1/23 headline was modified from its original incarnation "Cold Forecasts Warm Up Natural Gas Prices" sometime between when I wrote my prior post and now. In fact, you can still see that headline as the page's title. So it's good to see that someone over there is insisting on slightly more variety of diction, even if the changes are occurring four or five days late. The second, and more important thing to notice, are the functionally opposite headlines occurring 24 hours apart on 2/1 and 2/2. Anyone at all (say, for example, a professional commodities analyst) could point to at least TWO prior headlines that month and say that the news of EITHER 2/1 or 2/2 supports her model of rising OR declining gas prices. The volatility of these markets, especially when the weather is your primary driver, makes every session a significant one. -In the print version of the 2/1 article, there was also a B-Roll shot of some dudes playing football in Washington DC with the caption: "ICING THE KICKER? Unusually warm weather was a boon for football players in Washington in November; not so for those betting on gas." Awesome. That picture really helps me get a better understanding of the natural gas situation. You couldn't have put a chart there or something? (NB: Yes I appreciate the irony of making fun of a superfluous picture, and then not showing said picture myself while discussing it, but wsj.com seems not be hosting it. Apologies.) If you own stocks, this week probably wasn't your favorite. Still, it could have been worse; you could be European. The EU got smacked around this week in a scene not unlike the penultimate brawl in Road House , you know, when that dude with the stick beats up all of the bouncers at the Double Deuce. Take a look at the Euro over the last three months: Click here to download Flash Player now View the full FOREX:EURUSD chart at Wikinvest Then go ahead and change the view so that you're looking at the price over one month. I'm not a geopolitician, but from what I understand, Greece, Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain, are all having terrible times restructuring their debt, so much so, in fact, that investors are fleeing EU investment vehicles for the "security" of American government bonds and the US Dollar. The dollar, in essence, this week fed on the ballooning deficit of three EU nations and the fears they brought to investors. The side effect here is falling commodities prices, as gold, copper, and oil all declined significantly over the last few days, thanks primarily to steady increases in the value of the dollar. Gold, for example, is down about $60 from where it opened on Thursday. I find this notable for three reasons: The EU is experiencing the WORST of both possible worlds, as a collection of economically diverse, fully autonomous nations beholden to one central economy and currency, when one country suffers, EVERYONE suffers. This would be the equivalent of a debt crisis at an Illinois community bank making the dollar worthless in Japan. To what extent is Greece's fiscal stability the business of other EU nations? How beholden is Greece to EU nations helping it out of a jam? Commodities prices are decreasing as a function of a strengthening dollar against the Euro, specifically. The dollar has been falling against the Yen all month while moving more or less sideways against the Loonie. With all of the global trade that goes on, I would not have expected a simple shift from European to American investments, on its own, to have that sizable an effect on commodities prices; typically you'd need the dollar to get stronger against EVERYTHING for this kind of pricing plummet. Investors are fleeing Europe for the stability of the dollar. That's the US Dollar. The currency of the nation with 10% unemployment and interest rates of functionally 0. The nation with a $1.4 Trillion deficit. The nation currently fighting two wars. If the US economy is somehow the world's safe-haven right now, that does not bode well for the world.
This was the scene as we gathered together to meet in the Annual meeting of Des Moines Preceptory of Legion of Honor for DeMolay. The meeting always takes place on March 18 and it is a great group of men who have been honored by the Order of DeMolay.I am the Secretary -Treasurer of the group so I had to be there a little early. I stopped and picked up my new suit on the way out to the Willow Creek Golf Club. It was a good Iowa Pork Chop dinner and the meeting went very well. When I got home I started a Facebook group for the Preceptory. Miles in on my S&*T list. He pulled my Rosicrucian's necktie off the table and chewed it in half. I should have taken if off and put it on the rack. Oh well he is just being a puppy.And he is still a puppy. Just a big one.Then a real treat I got to watch the group Straight No Chaser on Iowa Public Television. And that reminded me that I needed to make my pledge so I took care of that. I support Iowa Public Television and Iowa Public Radio. They enrich my life immeasurably. I am tired so I think I shall close this. The Jokes are ready and they will be posted at 7:00 AM. Thanks for stopping by. Hugs.

Thank you for the great comments everyone has been leaving lately. &nbsp;There have been some questions about my materials I use to draw or software to animate. &nbsp;So, I'd like to answer some of them. &nbsp;I animate in Flash for 2D and Maya for 3D, with the exception of the occasional animation in After Effects or Nuke. &nbsp;I almost always draw quick, people, observational sketches with a pen. I have a nice Faber Castell 'S' PITT pen. &nbsp;If I'm drawing from my imagination, then I almost always use a medium-hard pencil &nbsp;H's or F's. &nbsp;If I like the drawing, I will sometimes refine it with a soft 4-6B pencil. &nbsp;If I add color, I usually scan in my drawing, set the drawing layer (in Photoshop or Illustrator) to 'multiply' blend mode and add color on layers below that. This is an illustration I made for an insurance company a few years ago. &nbsp;I was going through some old files and stumbled on it. It seems to give the sense of busy, which is what I am right now. &nbsp;It's an animated gif that I created in photoshop. &nbsp;Basically you feed 5 or 6 versions of a drawing into photoshop and it loops them. Last year while on vacation at one of the lakes in northern Indiana, there was this young girl who would catch frogs every night with a flashlight and a bucket. Not only could she catch them, but she could also stun them by rubbing their bellies. A couple of weekends ago, I rode down to Venice Beach to draw.&nbsp; I found a nice spot to sit and watch the graffiti guys working on the Art Wall . The History Channel has some new programs we've been enjoying at home.&nbsp; Here are a couple of characters from 'Pawn Stars' and 'Pickers' After a long Christmas break, the quest continues, as I try to dust the cobwebs off. Here are some people that held still long enough for me to draw them. The highlight of the day was the guy wearing heels and carrying his wife's purse. I attended the CTN-X animation expo this weekend. With all of the great panel discussions going on, it was a perfect time to draw and watch the hand gestures of the different speakers. it seems most people have similar hand/arm movements, but the subtle differences in the tension in the fingers reveal the unique personalities. They didn't broadcast the Colts game here on the west coast, so I was stuck watching a couple of teams that I didn't have much interest in. So I started drawing...
I can't take pictures when the Chapter is open but I snuck a photo in before we got started. Jean is giving some preliminary instruction prior to opening the Chapter.Jean and the Worthy Matron in a pre-meeting conference. Notice the large book on Jean's lap. That is just some of the material they have to go over. I was a little surprised to hear some of Jean's opening remarks and her closing....She got them right here from the "Found For Friday" jokes. I am glad that they were of use. Here are the rest of the photo's Enjoy! Hugs, j
Welcome to Grade 1: "Alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?"&nbsp; "They look like dolphins !"&nbsp; " Whales , like whales!"&nbsp; "Yeah FISH !!!"&nbsp; "SHAAARKS!"&nbsp; "Ooo ooo, Mr. Bond , oooo???!" "Yes, Billy?" " Miga !&nbsp; They look like Miga !"&nbsp; "YEAH!!! MIGA !!!"&nbsp; " MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA !!!!" "Settle down CHILDREN! CHILDREN! Ugh..." Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved 's next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ridden one? 7)&nbsp; Isn't there an easier way to spell "ichthyosaur?"&nbsp; Maybe with less h's? I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; Speak up!&nbsp; We won't bite! ...much! And to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working, watch this They Might Be Giants " Nine Bowls of Soup ," staring Mr. Ichthyosaur... Some fantastically modern artwork from 1959. Use the contents drop-down menu to go the the “Where Evolution Stands Today” article. Check out the ads along the way. I adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah, feel nostalgic. Note: cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool. &nbsp; When I say "Therapod" what pops into your mind?&nbsp; A sharp-toothed, fleet-footed, flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur, right?&nbsp; Tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs, raptors... But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; To participate in this and future Time Capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; It's not too late to join in the fun! So without further ado, welcome to ART Evolved's Therizinosaur Gallery! Click to enlarge them! &nbsp; &nbsp; A Brief Look at Therizinosaur Reconstructions through the Years by Tricia Arnold &nbsp; &nbsp; Alxasaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beipiaosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Erliansaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Erlikosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Falcarius by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Nanshiungosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Segnosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; Nothronychus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothronychus mckinleyi in graphite penci l by Mo Hassan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Brett Booth &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by&nbsp; Luis Perez &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaur (aka Chickenosaur!) by Rachael Revelle A4 lino print - Produced as a live blog and documented on my blogsite&nbsp;' Drawn In Time '. Therizinosaurus: a creature from Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a 'shape' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition. The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what I went with. My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period, China ) , using only pencil and paper.

Therizinosaur by Craig Dylke &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Giant Claw by Matthew Tames &nbsp; Here is a scene of a pair of Therizinosaurs protecting their nest. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus cheloniformis Feeding on Ginkgo by John Meszaros The&nbsp;geometrical stone structures&nbsp;in the background&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;columnar basalt formation&nbsp;such as can be found at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland or the Devil's Postpile in California. A Slap in the Face by Peter Bond A Therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing Alioramus remotus on a floodplain in Mongolia, 70-65 million years ago. I wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. Hopefully the Alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months. It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today . It's obviously missing a head. I've gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head. (I also haven't had time to work on it.) I am extremely happy with the rest of it. It came out perfect. It just needs a good head. &nbsp; We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs!&nbsp; Great job, everyone!&nbsp; The new poll is up on the right sidebar, so be sure to vote for July's Time Capsule ( wouldn't you just LOVE to draw ferns?! Erm... ) As for the next Gallery, the winner of that poll is ... ICHTHYOSAURS ! So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp; To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery, send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved@gmail.com . We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It's hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a "blog of note" on Google's official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates. We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork, wrote posts, or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start. Of course it doesn't end here. Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved! Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too. The new comers include: Rachael's lino print here Craig and Peter finally launch the first tandem Live Blog. Craig's efforts here . Peter's here . Zach's Therizinosaur has begun here . Sarah begins work on her Therizinosaur here . You can also still check out the previous efforts of: Tricia now has her "evolution" of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia's Obligatory Art Blog !!! Anthony live-blogged his Therizinosaur on Anthony Contoleon ’s Posterous ! It is still not too late to live blog, or more to the point have your live blogging effort advertised here! If you are planning on live blogging just let us know where (your site or blog that the updates will be appearing on) and when (with the date and rough time zone). You can either tell us in the comment section of this post or send us an email to artevolved@gmail.com . Till then happy live blogging! Just saw this and had to pass it on. (Thanks to Donna Braginetz of the Dinosaur Mailing list. There are very few platforms for up-and-coming paleoartists so this is very exciting: the John J. Lanzendorf Paleoart Award . Are you game? It's that time again, artists!&nbsp; Here is an overview of therizinosaurs in art, where we compile professional reconstructions of the animal in the next Gallery.&nbsp; March 1st, 2010 is the deadline for submissions for the Therizinosaur Time Capsule ! Therizinosaurs have had a long and convoluted history when it comes to reconstructions.&nbsp; Meat-eater or plant-eater?&nbsp; Prosauropod or coelurosaur?&nbsp; Skin or feathers?&nbsp; These questions led to wild variations in what a therizinosaur looked like!&nbsp; Below is a selection of therizinosaurs in art - click to enlarge ...

With so many early submissions arriving for the Therizinosaurs (thanks to all those who've sent them in ALREADY!... this is the first time in ART Evolved history we've had pieces well over a month in advance!) it is time for those of us who haven't quite got there to remedy this situation. As of such prepare for some... LIVE Blogging! The schedule for this round (so far) is as follows: &nbsp; Tricia now has her "evolution" of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia's Obligatory Art Blog !!! Anthony live-blogged his Therizinosaur on&nbsp; Anthony Contoleon’s Posterous ! Sometime in this week both Craig and Peter will be starting what they are hoping to be a most epic (and first ever) duo person Live Blog. They will be starting up at about 8-9am Pacific Coast time. It is not too late to live blog, or more to the point have your live blogging effort added to the list above!

Since my brain is still a bit foggy from the meds I'm using to fight the phlegm-based-evil which attacked me this week, I'll simply give you a rundown on what needs doing 'round these parts... A List of Kid Games I Need To Review Birds, Bugs and Beans Burg der 1000 Spiegel Click Clack Das Magische Labyrinth Enuk the Eskimo Feed the Kitty Gelini Nightlife A List of Other Games I Need To Review (or at least comment extensively about) A Brief History Of The World Adios Amigos Alea Iacta Est Burger Joint Ca$h 'n Gun$: Live Dungeon Lords Fightball: Aztecs vs. The Dark Keltis: Der Weg der Steine Marrakech Piece o' Cake The Adventurers Tobago I'm never quite sure what to expect from fiction by an author of Christian faith... for every wonderful reading experience (like Stephen Lawhead's Celtic Crusades or C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia ), there are numerous slogs through preachy &amp; cliched schlock. (Insert obligatory reference to the Left Behind books here.) It's a little like Tim Burton films - you never know when an "Edward Scissorhands" is going to bloom amongst a field of weeds like "Batman Returns" and "Planet of the Apes." It helps, of course, when you trust the author as someone who appreciates story &amp; subtlety, which is certainly true of Jeffery Overstreet. As a long-time reader of his articles &amp; reviews at ChristianityTodayMovies.com and his blog, LookingCloser.org , I was excited to find his first book, Through A Screen Darkly , which is a series of essays on movie-going &amp; faith. So when Mr. Overstreet released the first book in The Auralia Thread series, Auralia's Colors , I... checked it out from the library &amp; felt really guilty about not reading it. Yeah, I know, that wasn't the story I wanted to tell either, but it's the truth. I'm not sure what kept me from digging into the first novel - some of the reviews I'd read made it sound "artsy" and I never managed to pick it up and get into it before I had to return it. Fast forward a couple of years to the early part of 2010 when I agreed to blog/review Raven's Ladder , the third book in the series. I quickly realized that I didn't want to read book 3 before I read the first two books. So, for the past couple of weeks, I've carted around The Auralia Thread books and read them whenever I could... waiting for my boys at the park, taking a break at work, even squinting at them by the light of a bedside lamp. Yes, the books are that good. It's my assignment to review Raven's Ladder ... a task which I'm finding daunting. I want to try &amp; paint a picture of the book (and the series that leads up to it) without spoiling the joy of discovery that comes from reading a fantasy series set in a new world. I hope to get you to pick up Auralia's Colors and find yourself swept up by Jeffery Overstreet's beautifully crafted descriptions &amp; plotting... leading inexorably to you buying all three books. As I've thought about how to do this, I realized that The Auralia Thread reminds me of the TV series, "Lost." No, there's not an airline crash or a smoke monster or even a four-toed statue... but Mr. Overstreet uses the same kind of cinematic style of storytelling to move his plot forward. We get to see important moments from the viewpoints of different characters. Hints are dropped &amp; questions are raised at odd moments that pay off chapters (or sometimes even books) later. The author, much like the writers on "Lost," isn't afraid to kill off characters or radically alter their lives rather than simply pander to our desires for things to be tied up in a simplistic package. And while the story has definite philosophical &amp; spiritual themes (esp. the relationship of art &amp; faith), those themes don't seem to drive the plot. Instead, they flow out of the natural development of the characters and their lives. Importantly for me, this is NOT a Christian allegory. Playing the "who's the Christ figure?" game with Christian-penned fantasy novels quickly grows tiresome and takes me out of the book and into "theology debate" mode. Jeffery Overstreet deftly avoids this while still dealing with questions about blind faith, the relationship of art &amp; theology, legalism &amp; freedom, desire as the arbiter of truth, and a plethora of other important themes. I realize that writing about "serious themes" is likely to turn off some readers. I wonder if my initial hesitation to read Auralia's Colors has to do with other reviewers writing similar things. Pleased, give the story a chance... let the wonder &amp; mystery of this fascinating fantasy world pull you in. Some specific notes about Raven's Ladder : The prologue tells a story that I was sure would be the first half of the book (based on what had gone before). In other words, Jeffery Overstreet managed to both fulfill my expectations and take the story in some wild new directions in just a few pages. The book covers even more of The Expanse in vivid detail. There's a story (told by Krawg) that absolutely blew me away near the middle of the book... and the implications of what happens to that story speaks volumes about the way we deal with truth &amp; art in our culture. Some key story lines are resolved here, while others are advanced and left hanging... thankfully, there is at least one more book coming! It's probably no surprise that I recommend this book (well, the whole series) heartily! These are the times that try men's souls. Thomas Paine was actually talking about the American colonies fighting for independence from British rule... but it's the first quote that popped into my head when I thought about being a parent. Parenting is hard. For those of you who are parents, this is not a surprise. There are so many competing needs, expectations &amp; dreams bouncing around in our brains, both for our kids and for ourselves. It's a wonder anybody survives the 18 or so years it takes to raise a child, let alone two or three kids. (Those of you with 4+ children are either saints of incredible patience or gluttons for punishment... or both.) Some of us had great parenting models from our families that balanced wise discipline with gracious love. We had families that showed interest in our lives &amp; hearts and encouraged us to make good choices regarding spiritual truth &amp; moral/ethical choices. Others of us had families of origin that were replete with all sorts of dysfunctional behaviors: verbal &amp; physical abuse, neglect, addictions &amp; codependcy... the list could go on &amp; on. Either way, it's pretty common for parents to latch onto some kind of resource to act as a guide for their parenting - when you're tired &amp; frustrated &amp; overwhelmed, it's a lot easier to read a book and follow what it says. This explains, in earlier generations, the popularity of Dr. Spock &amp; his book "Baby &amp; Child Care" (and, no, this isn't the "live long &amp; prosper" Spock, btw)... and in the last few years, the cultural impact of folks like Dr. Phil and Dr. Laura. (Interesting side observation: we like to listen to people who sound like they are well-educated.) In Christian circles, the "go-to" guy has been Dr. James Dobson (there is that doctor title again!). While I don't agree with every political crusade that Dr. Dobson has undertaken, I've found his parenting books &amp; the materials he recommends to be helpful. But there are more folks out there who have teaching ministries, purporting to have THE Biblical way to parent your child(ren) most effectively. Some of those ministries go beyond the bounds of what you can legitimately claim from Scripture to support their particular (usually legalistic) version of parenting. Without going into major detail, I want to refer you to a couple of sites that talk about two of these ministries: The checkered history of Gary Ezzo and the variety of resources he has published (including Babywise and Growing Kids God's Way) is worth a very careful look - Ezzo.info does a great job of compiling articles &amp; responses. The "teaching" that set me off to write this post comes from Michael &amp; Debi Pearl and their No Greater Joy ministry - TulipGirl's blog has an excellent list of warnings &amp; critiques of what they teach and the horrific consequences For me, any kind of useful parenting advice is going to lead me to balance grace &amp; truth, to show both justice &amp; mercy, to use discipline in order to build up the character of my boys rather than break their spirits. It will not affirm my cultural preconceptions but instead inspire me to treat my family (and esp. my children) as gifts entrusted to me &amp; my wife. Good parenting techniques will not necessarily make my life easier. In fact, they will focus on helping me raise adults rather than control children. When the advice goes the other way - and particularly when the advice purports to be "God's way" - I need to call it what it is... a lie. You didn't know this? All you have to do is watch read/watch the news to figure it out. For example, did you know that Avatar is the "highest grossing film of all time"? Really - of course, that means you don't take inflation into account... or currency fluctuation... or the premium charge that most theaters levy for watching films in 3-D and/or IMAX. Nah, math is magic, remember? If you can add up the numbers, it's A-OK. Or another example, this one a bit more serious. Did you know that the current war in Iraq (which, on March 20th of this year, will have lasted 7 years) is longer than World War Two? Granted, that depends on when you count WW2 as starting. See, if you date it by American involvement, it's not quite 3 years &amp; 9 months from the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 to the surrender of Japan in August 1945. The traditional start of the war, however, is September 1, 1939, with the Nazi invasion of Poland (which makes the war almost 6 years long)... and I would suggest that you could make a case for the starting date being the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (September 13, 1931) which means the war lasted 14 years. But what really cheesed me off about NBC's comparison of the Iraq War last week was the length comparison to WWII followed by a list of Americans killed &amp; wounded in Iraq. In nearly 7 years of fighting &amp; occupation, 4380 American soldiers have been killed and approximately 30,000 troops have been wounded. Those are tough numbers - no one wants to see that kind of grief &amp; pain visited on families &amp; friends. However, NBC failed to provide context to those numbers... particularly since they had JUST made the length comparison to the Second World War. Over 400,000 US soldiers were killed during our involvement in WWII. 670,000 plus were wounded. In fact, over 19,000 US troops were killed during the Battle of the Bulge, which lasted just over 6 weeks. Look, I'm not arguing for or against the Iraq War... or the success of a 3D movie, for that matter. What drives me crazy is that by refusing to set our pronouncements in historical context, we make decisions based on our visceral reaction rather than on good sense... and that is exacerbated when we imply false comparisons of data. OK, I'll climb down off my soapbox &amp; start working on my sermon for this week now... I posted a bit yesterday about my Annual Oscar Birdbath... and so, as promised, the results. Well, I'm a bit embarassed... I won. Not a commanding win, mind you - I got sixteen correct (out of 24) and FOUR 2nd place finishers each got fifteen correct! They are: Elizabeth Arneson (oh-so-patient &amp; loving wife of Erik Arneson, my friend who runs the About.com/Board Games site) Gigi Johnson (who was nice to me back in high school &amp; not just because her sister &amp; I share the same birthday) Margaret Kellar (1/4 of the much-missed Kellar clan... her husband was our worship/youth pastor here at NewLife) Susan Rozmiarek (Ed &amp; Susan are gamers, friends, and - sadly - Aggies) Congratulations also go to the two 3rd place finishers (with 14 correct)... Bob Trezise &amp; Keith Monaghan. Here are the final scores... 16 - Mark Jackson 15 - Elizabeth Arneson, Gigi Johnson, Margaret Kellar, Susan Rozmiarek 14 - Bob Trezise, Keith Monaghan 12 - the "collective mind", Erik Arneson, Jeff Monaghan, Rebecca Becknal 11 - Jason Bullion 10 - Greg Thatcher, J.

BEST LIVE-ACTION SHORT: The New Tenants (we picked Miracle Fish) BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM: Logorama (we picked A Matter of Loaf &amp; Death)... NONE of us got this correct! And some final thoughts on the Oscar ceremony and a couple of the films: The category explanations were much more concise &amp; "spot on" than in previous years... and the lame jokes by presenters were kept to a minimum - thank you. Hollywood, if you're listening, John Lasseter told you the secret to making great films during his short film introduction blurb. Hint: it's not the tools. Ben Stiller is to Oscar night as John Ratzenberger is to Pixar films. The dual host thing worked OK - not bad but not great. Please don't waste Neil Patrick Harris again - if you're going to let him sing, turn him loose in something besides a Vegas showgirls number. Didn't listen to the majority of the acceptance speeches thanks to Tivo - probably missed a good moment or two but also missed a lot of dreck. What was up with George Clooney? Who put a thumbtack in his chair? I guess I need to see "The Hurt Locker" now. And "Avatar." The memorial for John Hughes was very classy... thanks, Academy. "The Breakfast Club" is still one of the best films ever about the social dynamics &amp; rabid insecurities of high school. Each year since 2000, I've hosted what I jokingly call "Mark's Oscar Birdbath"... it's just not right to call it an Oscar Pool when there's no money involved. I invite folks from throughout my life (past &amp; present churches, high school friends, family, gamer buddies, etc.) to participate. (Don't be miffed if you weren't asked to join - what with the compiling of the Five &amp; Dime reports and life in general, I don't want to get too big a crowd playing.)

A couple of "I'd like to thank the Academy"-ish kind of things to close this post out: Thanks to Steve Stigler &amp; his buddies from high school (especially Chris Newcomb), who first introduced me to Oscar Pools and the musical stylings of Stephen Sondheim when we were students together at Baylor University Thanks to Matt Baldwin, whose website, Defective Yeti , is the one who makes it so darn easy for me to maintain the Birdbath As some of you remember, one of my favorite blogs is NPR's pop culture mash-up, Monkey See . What follows is from a post from there by Linda Holmes - it's actually about pop culture &amp; science education, but see if it doesn't apply equally well to ministry... Neil deGrasse Tyson: At the end, I said, "Just by a show of hands, how many among you do not own a television?" These are people who teach physics. Half the hands went up. I said, "Of those who remain, who own a television, how many of you don't watch it except maybe you put a movie on it?" Half the hands went up. Which meant three-quarters of that audience had no access to the single greatest force on the thinking of the people who it is that they're trying to teach. And I said to them: you cannot call yourself an educator if you have no insights into the tangled mental pathways that exist in the people who you are trying to teach. It's not just a lesson plan you're handing people. You've got to get in the head and find out how they're going to misthink what it is you're saying. You've got to get in the head and find out what excites them to care about what it is you're saying. And if you don't, you're just simply lecturing. You're not an educator, you're a lecturer, and they either get it or they don't. If that's what you are, fine, but don't pretend you're anything else. So the average kid watches 30 hours of TV a week. You should at least know what it is. I'm not saying watch it every night. But if there's a hit show, know what the hit show is. Take a minute, watch American Idol. Watch NOVA. Watch the movie of the week. Watch the football game. Watch Janet Jackson's left breast. Find out what people are talking about. Because that will matter to them, whether or not it matters to you. You know something? You're not the subject of that class -- they are... Not all television programming lends itself to that analysis, but nonetheless, there could have been an episode that had an interesting twist, a plot that you can tap. In fact, I view those tools as features on the utility belt that I carry with me every day. I'll call that my cultural utility belt... And therein, I think, should be the tool kit of the educator. Little bit of pop culture, little bit of sports, little bit of politics, little bit of everything that's not in your field, because it's going to be in everybody else's portfolio of interests. It allows you to go places undreamt of if all you did was speak to the line-by-line notes of your curriculum. Read the whole thing at Why Educators Need A Cultural Utility Belt . 44 years ago today, John Lennon opened his mouth during a magazine interview in England and this is what tumbled out: Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me. A few months later, the American magazine Datebook reprinted the quote... and things went a bit nuts. There were record burnings, death threats, and even the KKK got involved. By the way, important safety tip: you can figure out when you've probably gone off the deep end in your reactions when the Ku Klux Klan agrees with you. (You can read more details about it on Wikipedia .) Lennon: I suppose if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I would have gotten away with it, but I just happened to be talking to a friend and I used the words "Beatles" as a remote thing, not as what I think - as Beatles, as those other Beatles like other people see us. I just said "they" are having more influence on kids and things than anything else, including Jesus. But I said it in that way which is the wrong way. Reporter: Some teenagers have repeated your statements - "I like the Beatles more than Jesus Christ." What do you think about that? Lennon: Well, originally I pointed out that fact in reference to England. That we meant more to kids than Jesus did, or religion at that time. I wasn't knocking it or putting it down. I was just saying it as a fact and it's true more for England than here. I'm not saying that we're better or greater, or comparing us with Jesus Christ as a person or God as a thing or whatever it is. I just said what I said and it was wrong. Or it was taken wrong. And now it's all this. Reporter: But are you prepared to apologise? Lennon: I wasn't saying whatever they're saying I was saying. I'm sorry I said it really. I never meant it to be a lousy anti-religious thing. I apologise if that will make you happy. I still don't know quite what I've done. I've tried to tell you what I did do but if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry. So, this morning, my friend, game designer Stephen Glenn , decided to use his Facebook status update to mock the Beatles tune, "All You Need Is Love" - and then I commented about the anniversary... and we were off to the races. Let's say, for sake of argument, that at any given time the Beatles -were- more popular than Jesus. In the big False American Idol contest, Jesus comes in third behind money and The Beatles. Why would that even matter to someone who had chosen to dedicate their life to Christ? Are they so insecure and threatened if someone/thing happens to be more "popular" than their guy? First, ouch. Score one point for the snarky game designer with the Spiel des Jahres nomination under his belt. Biblically, Jesus was a "man of no reputation" ( Philippians 2:7 ) and "despised &amp; rejected by men" ( Isaiah 53 )... so I must humbly admit that you, Stephen Glenn, are correct. So, I didn't use it in a sermon - though that may still happen. It became a blog post. (Stephen graciously OK'd my use of this so I didn't have to steal &amp; therefore missed breaking a commandment tonight - thanks, dude!) Look, if Jesus really was a man of no reputation - a guy who managed to cheese off both the government &amp; the religious leadership - why are we who call ourselves followers of Christ so concerned about polishing his image? Isn't the objective to be more like Him rather than to make the world like Him? And if that's our goal, our vision, our pot of gold at the end of the proverbial rainbow, why do we waste so much of our time &amp; energy trying to force other people to pay respect to God, like we were some kind of enforcers for a spiritual mob boss or a ministers of protocol to some tinpot dictator? If God doesn't care that much about his Q rating, why should we? I'll let singer/songwriter Rick Elias have the last word(s) with his song, "Man of No Reputation" : It was said this man was of no reputation Yet He could stop the rising storm With a gesture of His hand But He chose to use His hands to heal Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone Just like mine would be revealed He was a man of no reputation And by the wise, considered a fool When He spoke about faith and forgiveness In a time when the strongest arms ruled But this man of no reputation Loved the weak with relentless affection And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were He was a man of no reputation It was said this man brought only confusion That He'd achieve his ends by any means And the truth that it brings revolution And for once they were right The truth set us free The hearts of the captive were his only concern And the powerful knew their days were ending One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride But for now we live on these streets Forbidding and tough Where push always comes to shove And it's said love's never enough Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world No injustice, no heart of darkness Will keep this voice from being heard He was a man of no reputation And by the wise, considered a fool When He spoke about faith and forgiveness In a time when the strongest arms ruled But this man of no reputation Loves us all with relentless affection And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are
This article, written by Jonathan Hartley, was originally published in the Python Magazine. Acceptance Testing .NET Applications using IronPython Unit tests demonstrate to developers that individual functions and classes work as expected. Acceptance tests are an orthogonal complement to this. They verify to everybody, including managers and clients, that features they understand and care about are completed and working correctly. They also prove that the system as a whole is correctly integrated and that no regressions have occurred. Resolver Systems is developing a .NET desktop spreadsheet application, Resolver One, for which we have accumulated an acceptance testing framework. This framework uses Python’s standard unittest module, and is executed using IronPython. While Resolver One is written in IronPython, this technique allows IronPython tests to interact with product code written in any .NET language. This article describes the principles of this IronPython acceptance testing framework, and demonstrates them by creating an acceptance test for a small sample C# GUI application.

You can get the discount by buying IronPython in Action from the Manning website and using the discount code dotd0310tw. It isn't only IronPython in Action that is on offer, you can also get Quick Python by Vern Ceder. &nbsp;In 2009 I made 312 posts on IronPython-URLs, a bit short of an average of one a day that it looked like I might manage earlier in the year. According to google analytics there were more than 112 thousand page views to a total of 2042 pages on the blog. An average of over three hundred page views a day. Feedburner estimates that this blog has around eight hundred readers. Many of those will read the articles via RSS or Planet Python and rarely visit the website. It's interesting to note that of the most popular articles in 2009 (most page views) several of them are to do with choice of IDE or using IronPython with Visual Studio. The question of which IDE to use with IronPython is still alive and well: New Sample: Writing a DLR Language in C# or IronPython &nbsp; (May 2009, 1892 page views) IronPython in SharpDevelop 3.1 and Converting C# to IronPython &nbsp; (May 2009, 1412 page views) C# Becomes a Dynamic Language... &nbsp; (December 2008, 1164 page views) Python is the easiest language in which to do interesting things &nbsp; (February 2009, 1150 page views) Python Support in Visual Studio &nbsp; (June 2009, 1119 page views) Another IDE for IronPython?

SLog: Silverlight Logging A nascent project to Port Log(4|5)J from Java to C# with the goal of usefulness in Silverlight, especially for IronPython. A WPF Picture Viewer NotifyIcon to use from IronPython &nbsp;Two Japanese blog entries, both by sasakima-nao. As with previous entries the code examples are very readable. The first is a simple WPF picture viewer (nice penguins) and the second shows how to create a NotifyIcon and ContextMenu in the taskbar (with Windows Forms classes). Python-Ruby (and a little bit of soap) This blog entry is in Russian, but I think there are enough code examples for it to be useful for those of us who don't speak Russian. As I've mentioned before the promise of the Dynamic Language Runtime is that dynamic languages can interoperate and share libraries. This is exactly what this blog entry shows: using the Ruby soap/wsdlDriver from Python. The cool thing is that this is done with a helper / wrapper library, that looks like it could be used to expose virtually any Ruby module / class that can be accessed through IronRuby to IronPython. Using his ruby module, the code looks like this: from ruby import _import_, get_class _import_('soap/wsdlDriver') Soap = get_class('SOAP::WSDLDriverFactory') client = Soap('http://localhost1/Service1.asmx?WSDL').create_rpc_driver() client.HelloWorld(None) I've Been Bitten By... IronPython Marcus McElhaney has discovered IronPython and likes it. The reasons he gives are: 1. I can very easy use everything I know about the .Net Framework, VB.Net, and&nbsp; C# 2. I can run IronPython in Visual Studio 3. I can reference ESRI's&nbsp; ArcObjects libraries in&nbsp; Visual Studio and IronPython What's even more gratifying is that he has been exploring IronPython through IronPython in Action and likes that too. A slight misspelling gives rise to my favourite quote about IronPython in Action: IronPython In Action is probably the best Python book I have ever pickled up because it also explains a lot of not just Python but also about .Net. If any book deserved to be pickled up, this is it... Have a great 2010. My belief is that the answer to the question in the title of this entry is an emphatic yes. Microsoft have poured a lot of money into IronPython, IronRuby and the Dynamic Language Runtime and have demonstrated a consistent commitment since the inception of IronPython. What they haven't done is build full support into their premier development tool, Visual Studio. The reason for this is that it is a very difficult problem. Visual Studio is built around statically typed languages. Features like intellisense, refactoring and code navigation all rely on having type information which is absent in languages like Python and Ruby. (The way they are implemented in Visual Studio requires that information I mean.) What Microsoft have done is provide example integration in the form of IronPython Studio, which frankly sucks . Many important features are fragile, broken or missing altogether. Good IDEs like PyDev and Wing do provide these features, so it is definitely possible - it just requires a lot of work from scratch. Microsoft have however added intellisense for Javascript , particularly for jQuery, into Visual Studio. Javascript is of course a dynamic language, but without having tried the integration I can't tell you how well it compares to using a good Python IDE. I believe that Microsoft would like to add support for dynamic languages to Visual Studio and that it will come eventually. Really they have a lot to lose by not doing it. Now they have a good platform for dynamic developers to use, which they give away free, but the tools they charge for don't really support them. This puts them in a position of either bringing developers to their platform but not being able to make any money, or having their existing developers stay with their platform but losing dependence on the toolset. Neither option looks much good for Microsoft. ( NOTE: for those who can't wait for official Microsoft support and have Visual Studio 2010, try Jeff Hardy's IronPython for Visual Studio Extensions .) Anyway, K. Scott Allen sees things a little differently and I understand his frustration: Is Microsoft taking Dynamic Languages Seriously? Consider this … IronPython got underway in July of 2004. Five years later it appears IronPython is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the .NET framework and tools. You can vote on this issue . Microsoft first released IronRuby at Mix in 2007. Nearly three years later it appears IronRuby is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the .NET framework and tools. You can vote on this issue . A first class language is deployed when the full .NET framework is installed. It’s as easy to find as csc.exe . It’s not a language you have to ask the IT department to install separately. It’s not a language that requires you to jump out of Visual Studio to edit or run. Most of all, a first class language doesn’t require justification to higher powers. A first class language is pre-certified and stamped with a seal of approval. It’s as easy to use in the locked-down big corporate setting as the company paper shredder. Of course here we are talking about Microsoft as if it was a single entity with a single intention. The reality of course is that Microsoft is a huge company with many divisions and even more individuals working there. In all likelihood the vast majority of Microsoft employees have never heard of IronPython. The relevant division is the programming languages group, which includes Visual Studio development, and where the majority of employees who are developers probably have heard of IronPython if not actually used it... Adding official dynamic languages support to Visual Studio would require substantial investment of time and effort, so even if everyone in this department was determined to add support it would still be dependent on forces from other parts of the company who have other needs and priorities... Ironclad is a compatibility layer that allows you to use Python C extensions with IronPython. Ironclad is open source and development has been funded by Resolver Systems and it is integrated into Resolver One to allow you to use Numpy within Resolver One spreadsheets . Ironclad works by implementing the Python C API in a combination of C#, C and Python. Although Ironclad only works on 32 bit Windows at the moment the implementation has been done in such a way that porting it to run on other platforms (with Mono) and 64 bit would be relatively easy. Patches welcomed! Recent development has changed the implementation to use gcc-xml to access and transform the Python C source code. By reusing as much of the original implementation as possible it minimizes the amount that needs to be 'hand-coded'. It leaves only a (moderately) small core that would need to be reimplemented if Jython, PyPy (or other implementations) wanted to reuse Ironclad. The C# would need to be re-coded in Java or RPython, using the platform's native FFI instead of PInvoke on .NET. The advantage of reusing Ironclad is that difficult problems, like handling the Global Interpreter Lock and matching reference counting to different garbage collection strategies, are already solved (well, for some value of solved...). Anyway, that is all by way of introduction. William Reade, core developer of Ironclad, has just announced Ironclad 2.6 RC. This is a release candidate of Ironclad targeting IronPython 2.6. Ironclad 2.6.0rc1 released I'm very happy to announce the latest release (candidate) of Ironclad, the 120-proof home-brewed CPython compatibility layer, now available for IronPython 2.6! No longer need .NET pythonistas toil thanklessly without the benefits of bz2 , csv , numpy and scipy : with a simple ' import ironclad ', (most parts of) the above packages -- and many more -- will transparently Just Work. Get the package from: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://code.google.com/p/ironclad/ ...and get support from: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://groups.google.com/group/c-extensions-for-ironpython ...or just ask me directly. I'm very keen to hear your experiences, both positive and negative; I haven't been able to test it on as many machines as I have in the past, so your feedback is especially important this time round-. Cheers William - I'd be especially grateful if someone with a newish multicore machine would run the numpy and scipy test scripts (included in the source distrbution) a few times to check for consistent results and absence of weird crashes; if someone volunteers, I'll help however I can. William has recently started blogging. I recommend browsing the few entries he has already posted, particularly this rant on static typing and this post on .NET marshalling , but his latest is of particular interest: Spare batteries for IronPython As we all know, Python comes with batteries included in the form of a rich standard library; and, on top of this, there are many awesome and liberally-licensed packages just an easy_install away. IronPython, of course, includes -most- of the CPython standard library, but if you're a heavy user you might have noticed a few minor holes: in the course of my work on Ironclad, I certainly have. Happily for you I can vaguely remember what I did in the course of bodging them closed with cow manure and chewing gum; here then, for your edification and delectation, is my personal recipe for a delicious reduced-hassle IronPython install, with access to the best and brightest offered by CPython, on win32. More IronPython and DLR related projects, articles and news from around the web. Embedded IronRuby and IronPython in Silverlight with Multiple Source Files A&nbsp; nice example of embedding both IronPython and IronRuby in a single C# project. As an added bonus the project is a Silverlight project so you can add both Python and Ruby scripting to applications that run in the browser. slimtune: A free profiling and performance tuning tool for .NET applications IronPython 2.6 has useful new hooks for profiling and debugging IronPython code. Unfortunately most 'standard' .NET tools don't know how to use these, and if you attempt to profile IronPython code (particularly in an embedded environment) you have to work hard to get useful information about performance of your Python code. It's nice to see a new (and open source) tool that is designed to work with IronPython: SlimTune is a free profiler and performance analysis/tuning tool for .NET based applications, including C#, VB.NET, IronPython, and more. It provides many powerful features, such as remote profiling, real time results, multiple plugin-based visualizations, and much more. The source code is available under the terms of the MIT License. SlimTune is currently in the prototyping phase of development, but a preview release is available for testing and feedback is welcome. Both x86 and x64 targets are supported, but only sampling based profiling is available in the release. Future of Managed JScript When IronPython 2 and the Dynamic Language Runtime were announced one of the three Microsoft developed languages that ran on the DLR was JScript. Managed JScript was an implementation of ECMAScript (otherwise known as Javascript) and touted as a useful bridge for porting 'traditional-ajax' applications to run on Silverlight. Unfortunately as the DLR evolved JScript languished and there was no official word on its fate. In this post on the DLR Codeplex forum Bill Chiles (DLR Program Manager) gives the bad news: The DLR JScript was experimental for informing the design of the DLR (expression trees, interop, callsites, hosting, etc.).&nbsp; The JS we released with asp futures and the Silverlight dynamic sdk became very old and unserviceable as the DLR continued evolving for release in CLR 4.0.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are no plans at this time to develop and release a DLR-hostable JScript. IronPython SHGetFileInfoW is ctypes A Japanese blog entry showing example code using the new implementation of ctypes in IronPython 2.6. ctypes is the Python FFI and in IronPython it is built on top of PInvoke , the .NET FFI. ctypes is used for calling into native code, like the Win32 API. Calls SHGetFileInfoW , which " Retrieves information about an object in the file system, such as a file, folder, directory, or drive root ." IronPython on deviantART No idea what this has to do with the implementation of Python for .NET, but IronPython is the username of someone on the alternative community art site deviantART. Some pretty nice computer generated art, and who knows - maybe they were created from Python... IronPython and the Dynamic Language Runtime make it almost ridiculously easy to add scripting to .NET applications. In recent weeks several examples of using IronPython to add scripting or interactive shells to .NET applications have been posted by the .NET community: Command-line scripting of IronPython code in 
utoCAD This post was heavily inspired by the code presented by my old friend Albert Szilvasy during his excellent AU class on using .NET 4.0 with AutoCAD . ... In this post we’ll take Albert’s technique and implement a command-line interface for querying and executing IronPython script. This approach could also be adapted to work with other DLR languages such as IronRuby, of course. Here’s the updated C# code which now not only implements PYLOAD functionality, but also a PYEXEC command. &nbsp; Scriptability via the DLR and PostSharp &nbsp;Making an application scriptable (particularly in a static language) has historically been difficult. With the advent of the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) on the .NET platform it becomes almost trivial to add scripting support to any application. For a recent project I needed the ability to add scripting hooks throughout the application and coupling the DLR with PostSharp AOP attributes made this effort pretty straightforward. Here’s how it was done. Revit Python Shell Introducing RevitPythonShell According to wikipedia : " Autodesk Revit is Building Information Modeling software for Microsoft Windows, currently developed by Autodesk, which allows the user to design with parametric modeling and drafting elements.&nbsp; Building Information Modeling is a Computer Aided Design (CAD) paradigm that allows for intelligent, 3D and parametric object-based design. " Jeremy Tavik blogs about working with the Revit API, and in this post he discusses a Python Shell for Revit that created by Daren Thomas with IronPython: Daren Thomas of the Professur für Gebäudetechnik, Institut für Hochbautechnik at the technical university ETH Zürich has published a Python Shell for Revit. It was implemented using IronPython and is used to automate the running of daily tests of a building energy analysis package. Hosting IronPython via a Revit plug-in is a now solved problem. Daren's intention is to continue publishing samples of what you can do with it pretty regularly in the future. The source code is available under the GNU General Public License v3 from a Subversion repository on code.google.com. It is documented, though there is currently little other stand-alone documentation. One would probably want to look for the IExternalApplication entry point and go from there. What the application does is: Add a button to the Revit ribbon to start the python shell. Execute a python script entered in a text box, with output going to a separate window. Daren describes one of the main scripts like this: it " will open up an interactive interpreter loop known as a REPL that will let you explore the Revit API. And by explore, I mean type a statement, hit enter, see the results, carry on. It doesn't get easier as this! " Scripting ADAM with IronPython IronPython is an implementation of the Python language for the .NET framework, using the new Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) as language services layer on top of the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The DLR's reusable hosting model makes it extremely suitable to add scripting capabilities to existing products. In this post we'll create an ADAM command line utility that will allow us to run IronPython scripts against an ADAM application. ... Our command line tool will expose a single command, RunScript, that will take in ADAM connection information and a path to a Python file to execute:
This video is over a year old but I just found out about it today and had to share. I always enjoy these videos where love knows know bounds. There is a follow up to this story as well. After this story aired, the couple was inundated with book and movie offers. Not surprising. This youtube video has more then 3 million views. The Mass House has voted to ban the surgical " debarking " or silencing of dogs or cats unless a vet says it's needed for the health of the dog. These small steps help in reducing the amount of animal cruelty that happens. The vote was 150-1. I just found out about this and was shocked to find a 15 year old from Needam high, Jordan Star , proposed this bill with the help of Scott Brown and backed by Democratic House Majority Whip Lida E. Harkins. This process is over a year in the making and seems to be one way of getting both parties to work together. Good work. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Muddy feet 8/52 , originally uploaded by phaird . Everyone who brought the dog to the park this weekend either planned on giving there dog a bath or had to anyway. It's been raining in and around Mass for a few days and the temps have been staying above freezing. All this makes for some really messy parks. I bailed out on our walk in the woods today because there are too many mud traps on the path. A few weeks ago we had to abandon our walk because of the path being too icy. Today I didn't even try because of the mud. I am excited that March is here. I've got plans for some spring photo shoots at the park in Acton, Waltham, Boston, and a few other places. I think it will be lots of fun. I'm going to set up a studio shoot and try to photograph as many dogs as I can. I'm hoping that will be a good promotion for my photography business. Still in the planning stages but more info will come soon. Dog toys as just toys are so old skool. Check out Nina Ottosson . She has created a whole set of dog PUZZLES. Yea, average chew toys with some food in it isn't enough for the serious dog owner anymore. You've got to get the puzzle to really keep your pet entertained. My mind thought that this might be a little odd for a dog. Almost mean because I would think the dog doesn't really care about the game, only about the treat. But in the article in the Bark magazine online, she points out dogs that are goal driven, like herding dogs, really enjoy and learn the process. I like the idea. I'm not sure my Toby would really be into it but I do know a few dogs at the park who would get a kick out of something like this to pass the time. If they couldn't make it to the park that is. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } waiting for treats , originally uploaded by phaird . It was another cold, windy day at the park. Toby and I tried to walk up the paths behind the open area where the dogs spend most of there time. We didn't get very far because the path was too icy. We came back down and hung out with the Aussies. There is always a few here at the park. There can be as many as 12 or more on a busy day but that is more in the summer. There were some new dogs who found there way to the park this weekend too. Word of mouth is a powerful thing. One dog, Colby (like the cheese), just moved to the area and are really loving the open space. his owner heard about the Acton park from a neighbor and found her way here. It's always good to have more dogs playing. Colby met Ringo and played non-stop for almost an hour. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Toby surrounded , originally uploaded by phaird . Winter can be hit or miss at the park. When one day can be sunny and nice and the next could be windy, snowing and cold. you'll always have the regulars at the park. They know what to expect and their dogs demand that they show up. So the people show up all wrapped up in there winter gear, faces covered, gloves on and leash ready. There was a group who showed up on sweat shirts thinking that would be enough in an open field with no protection from the wind. I watched as they scurried back to their car to get their heavy coats. Most of the dogs don't care. Some like mine, a small rat terrier with a short coat is much happier in doors, on the couch, wrapped in a blanket (yea, he's spoiled). But others like the Aussies love it. They can run and never get over heated. The community and interaction is something that they look forward to every week. To be honest, so do I. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Aussies wanting treats , originally uploaded by phaird . How can such a sunny day feel so cold. Okay, I know. I'm a wimp but if I am, so is Toby. It's been really cold for the past few days and even with the sun out, I didn't last too long at the park. Some dogs, like the Aussies don't care at all. They love being out in the snow, running around, chasing balls. It was great for them. The More the better. Tikka, Jake, bella and others were all out today. There is a pretty large group of Aussies who come very weekend and they are always great to see. Very smart dogs, they love coming out, being around other dogs as well as good with people, you never have to worry about them getting out of hand. As herding dogs, I'd expect to see them chasing the other dogs around and try to keep an order but that isn't the case. They hang out, play ball, and check in with there owners most of the time. It does help that there owners love them dearly and treat them so well. It's nice to see that lots of good postings and keeping my blog active is slowly paying off. I've been asked by this dog training website ( trainpetdog.com ) to sign up for the 2010 Dog Blog Award Contest. This isn't based on the quality of the blog or even the content. I could put up my other blog about commuting which I abandoned a while back and if I could get enough people to vote for it, I could win. It's all about getting you, my readers to click on the link and sign in. Now at first I was kinda excited but then was a bit skeptical. This is normally to get people to sign up to be on a mailing list. That is just what this is BUT, I went through the process, signed up, and voted for myself. It does take you to a "join our mailing list" but you don't have to fill that part out. All you have to do is put in a code on the main page and that's it. Once you submit that info, you don't have to join the mailing list. You can if you want but as long as it's an option, I figured, what could it hurt. SO, if you'd like to help me receive the 2010 Dog Blog Award, Please go the the Trainpetdog.com website and put in this code. 6nfQA . Thanks everyone for being such great fans of my blog.

Nicely done, Former Filthy Assistant! by M A N @roquesdoodle I'm in Seattle getting ready for the Emerald City Comicon at the moment, so no big post today. But I thought it'd be fun to mention two of Seattle's biggest contributions to the guitar world: Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain . One was the godfather of shred and represents the quintessential rock star while the other does...not. They had radically different approaches to the instrument from one another, yet both still have tremendous influence on players. And both changed popular music as we know it. Funny what you can do with six strings and a piece of wood. Any other Seattle guitar players (or musicians in general) worth mentioning? Let's hear it in comments.

Before reading any of the "reviews", you should read the intro , the FAQ , the MOVIES I HAVE ALREADY SEEN list, and if you want, the glossary of genre terms and " What is Horror? ", which explains some of the "that's not horror!" entries. There is also a handy recommendation thread that you can use to post suggestions for movies. And to keep things clean, all off topic posts are re-dated to be in JANUARY 2007 (which was before I began doing this little project) once they have 'expired' (i.e. are 10 days old). Due to many people commenting "I have to see this movie!" after a review, I have decided to add Amazon links within the reviews (they are located at the bottom), as well as a few links to the Horror Movie A Day Store around the page, hopefully non-obstructively. Amazon will also automatically link things they find relevant, so there might be a few random links in a review as well. If they become annoying, I'll remove the functionality. Right now I'm just kind of amused what they come up with (for example, they highlighted 'a horror movie' in the middle of one review and it links to, of all things, the 50 Chilling Movies Budget Pack!!!). Last but not least, some reviews contain spoilers (NOTE - With a few exceptions, anything written on the back of the DVD or that occurs less than halfway through the movie I do NOT consider a spoiler). I will be adding 'spoiler alerts' for these reviews as I go through and re-do the older reviews (longtime readers may notice that there is now a 'show more' which cleaned up the main page, as well as listing the source of the movie I watched, i.e. Theaters, DVD, TV) to reflect the new format. This is time consuming, so bear with me. Thanks for coming by and be sure to leave comments, play nice, and as always, watch Cathy's Curse . MARCH 16, 2010 GENRE: PREDATOR , SURVIVAL SOURCE: DVD (ONLINE RENTAL) I was surprised to learn that William Girdler was only my age when he died (in a helicopter crash), shortly after the release of his epic The Manitou . I had figured he was in his 50s or something, especially since that and his previous film, Day Of The Animals (aka Something Is Out There ), featured mostly middle aged characters. It’s rare to see someone write/direct a film populated primarily with characters that are far older than they are. It’s really a damn shame that he died so young; in just seven years he made NINE features, all of which have a cult following (and are quite entertaining, at least of the ones I have seen). I wonder what he would have done in the 80s... Anyway, Animals is a treat. It’s apparently a “but with more animals” version of his previous film Grizzly (which itself was a Jaws knockoff), so I hope I haven’t spoiled that film for myself, but if its even half as much fun as this, I’m sure I’ll still have a damn good time. Like Frogs or Long Weekend , the film is about animals taking revenge on the humans that have ruined their habitat, but it’s far more entertainment-minded than those films. And by that I mean I laughed at pretty much every death scene. The key one is when Jon Cedar’s character is killed by snakes AND a dog (odd team up) as he tries to get into a car that will allow him to rescue a little girl. Stupidly backing into his snake-filled car, he is first bitten a few times by the rattlers and such, and then the dog leaps on him and tears him apart. Not only is his death a bit of a surprise (since he was a pretty decent guy and had been more or less set up as a hero), but it’s also a bit of a hilarious “bummer”, since it seems likely that the little girl isn’t going to get rescued either (but she does, much later). I just wish there was some more variety, or at least fewer dog attacks. The film’s poster suggests an entire Wildlife Treasury box of antagonists, but it’s primarily dogs for the film’s final half hour, which is odd as they aren’t exactly forest dwelling animals. They also prolong one of the dog attacks (at the helicopter) by obviously re-using shots; I’d rather the attack was just shortened and then maybe a lion or some rabbits show up and make things worse. Can’t go wrong with the cast though. You got one of the many Christopher and Linda George (real life husband and wife) team ups, although their characters oddly rarely speak to each other despite being in the same location for the bulk of the film. Like Girdler, George died way too young; his performances are usually the highlight of the numerous horror films in which he starred during the late 70s/early 80s. But even better: Leslie Nielsen in a rare villainous role. He plays the requisite asshole of the group (a la NOTLD ’s Mr. Cooper), and turns from mildly abrasive to full blown crazy over the course of the film, ultimately attempting to rape one of the female members of the ill-fated hiking group (after knocking around a woman AND her 10 year old son). Even scarier - he plays his final scenes without a shirt. If you’ve only seen him in his spoof comedies, this shit will blow your mind (it’s still not as disturbing as his sleazy john character in Nuts, however). Incidentally, one of his Airplane! co-stars also shows up - the little girl who takes her coffee “black, like her men”. RIP Peter Graves, by the way. It also has enough characters to keep it from getting boring, and refrains from killing them too quickly, which allows for more suspense. As with Tremors , they repeatedly put supporting characters in danger, but allow them to escape with minor injuries. A movie like Rogue sort of weakens itself by keeping the supporting cast out of it for the entire last third of the film, but this one keeps everyone around. And Girdler split them into three groups, so we get different settings, different group dynamics, and yes, different animals (though again, dogs seem to be everywhere). And as this is a 70s disaster film, you get a wide variety of characters - a cancer stricken football pro, a journalist, a young couple, Nielsen’s bitter businessman, the mother and son, etc. Some faces may be more familiar than others, but it really is an ensemble piece; even the Georges don’t have noticeably more screen time than the others. And it stays with them - there are some haz-mat guys wandering around at the end, but it's not like The Crazies where we keep cutting away from the action to show government and scientist types yammering about the problem and how to solve it. I just wish Media Blasters/Shriek Show had given the film more respect in the AV department. The transfer itself is fine - in that it’s anamorphic and doesn’t seem to be washed out. But they were using a terrible print as the source, the entire film is covered with scratches, color artifacts (the woods are purple during a big chunk of the climax), and even skips! At one point Nielsen is walking along with George, talking about food, and then suddenly he is stopped, talking to one of the other characters about something else entirely. The sound is pretty lousy too, it sounds like a record playing from the next room. Basically it looks like the stuff you get on Mill Creek releases, except you’re paying 20 bucks instead of 20 cents. The “TV Version” is also included, and it’s taken from a much cleaner source (no major print damage), but it’s also washed out and horribly cropped - they seemingly matted the (cropped) 1.33 TV ratio to 16:9, which means you’re missing the sides AND the top and bottom of the image! Examples below: No idea why they did this (and, obviously, both versions are more compressed than they should be in order to fit what is essentially two films on one side of the disc), but I wish they had looked for a better print, or at least tried to clean up the one they had. The technical issues carry over to the commentary too; Lynda George is muffled, Cedar sounds hollow, and Scott Spiegel sounds like he’s outside of the recording booth entirely. Spiegel is there to moderate, presumably, but he does a lousy job of keeping them on track. For every story about the film itself, there are about five about other movies/people/subjects entirely. Some of them are amusing - George talks about Pieces ! - but others are extraneous at best; I must admit I don’t really care to hear their thoughts on the merits of Gigli , the Mission: Impossible movies, or random Bill Shatner anecdotes, especially when the audio is so all over the place. The retrospective interviews are better, especially as they include animal wrangler/co-star Susan Backlinie (best known as the girl who gets killed in the opening scene of Jaws ), though George is absent for some reason (they had her for the commentary, they didn’t grab an interview?). Basically, it SOUNDS like a really great package on paper, but the actual presentation is largely shoddy and, frankly, amateurish. Make sure you pick this up dirt cheap. Now, on to Grizzly ! Or Abby , Girdler’s infamous “Black Exorcist” that was pulled after Warner Bros. threatened to sue. Anyone have a copy of that one? What say you? MARCH 15, 2010 GENRE: THRILLER SOURCE: DVD (STORE RENTAL) Remember the good ol’ days, when legit horror movies were billed as “psychological thrillers” or whatever by horror-fearing producers? Nowadays, it’s the other way around; standard thrillers like Possession are sold as full blown horror movies. The DVD and trailers proudly point out that the film is from the producers of The Ring and The Grudge , and the cover showed a ghostly, Feardotcom -y figure that has fuck all to do with the film. And the title was changed from Addicted to Possession , apparently in an attempt to get it to join Alien, Monster , Werewolf , and several other films where the title shares a name with its would-be HMAD genre tagging. Spoilers ahead! If you notice, I have not listed this as a Possession movie. But if you’ve seen the trailers or read a synopsis, you know the basic premise behind the film - two brothers, one an asshole (Lee Pace - surprisingly effective as a hardass) and the other a perfect man (Michael Landes), get into a car accident that leaves them both comatose. Pace wakes up and claims he’s his brother, having all of his memories and very much in love with the guy’s wife (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Is he possessed? Did they switch bodies? Or, is the asshole just putting on the most gloriously complicated act in history so he can nail his sister in law? I’ll let you double check the genre tagging and make your decision. Now, to be fair, at least it grounds the movie in some sort of reality, in that there’s nothing supernatural or metaphysical about it - the dude is simply lying. But in order to work, we have to suspend far too much disbelief; in fact, even more than we would had there actually been a supernatural explanation. Not only does he have to take on all of his brother’s mannerisms, but he has to learn how to sculpt, garden, etc. as his brother did (whereas he seemed to be some sort of electrician in his asshole life). He also has to hope that Gellar never asks him anything he can’t answer, such as, I dunno, one of the presumably millions of things they did together that the brother DIDN’T take a photo of or write about in a love letter. See, Gellar finally figures out the ruse when she goes through her letters and photos and sees that her husband had written about every single thing that Pace had used to “prove” he was Landes. It takes a full year for this to dawn on her, which is stupid enough (did she not READ the letters when they were given to her?), but again - did she restrict her inquiries to only the most memorable moments in their relationship? I suppose we are to believe that the part of her that wanted her husband back allowed her to sort of live in denial a bit. In fact, that IS the point of the film’s original ending, which is available on the DVD. It makes the film even less of a “horror” movie, but it’s at least more interesting. Originally, she realized he was lying and just let it slide, because I guess she figured a guy pretending to be her husband was better than nothing. In the ending on the film itself, she confronts him and they have a typical “chase through the house on a rainy night” battle, killing him in the process. Her real husband remains comatose (in the original ending they took him off life support). There’s a bit too much repeated footage on the alternate ending (it’s literally the entire last half hour of the movie, but only about 5-10 minutes are different), and again it makes its horror connection even flimsier, but its definitely preferable to the one that ended up in the film from a creative/storytelling point of view. If you are still interested in watching it after I’ve just spoiled BOTH endings, switch to the alternate after Gellar and Pace make love in the theatrical. I also think they go a bit overboard with trying to make Landes seem like the perfect man. He brings her flowers (twice!), makes her a cake, decorates the outside of their house with lights, lights a bunch of candles, doesn’t mind when she forgets their anniversary, fixes her grandmother’s necklace.... OK buddy, you’re a god and it would be a real shame if something bad happened to you. WE GET IT. The movie could have benefited from possibly not painting the brothers as such polar opposites - it would make the concept a bit easier to swallow, and they could use that screentime to develop Pace’s character a bit more. Why is he such a scumbag? And where did he acquire such fantastic mimic skills? Interestingly, if you go back and watch the film a 2nd time (or watch it knowing the ending), you can see him “learning” his brother’s styles by watching him garden, make love, etc. So he wasn’t just being a creepy perv, he was doing "impersonate my brother" research! You know, JUST IN CASE they both went comatose someday. The DVD also has some other deleted scenes, including one where William B. Davis’ hypnotist character more or less spoils the ending, which I assume is why it was cut. The trailer is also included, but you don’t need it because the featurette is essentially just the trailer mixed with brief interview snippets with the stars and directors Joel Bergvall and Simon Sandquist, who wear matching jackets. Not very insightful stuff; they basically reiterate the plot and try to make you think the movie is far more twisty-turny than it actually is. You want a good version of the car accident/amnesia plot? Watch Wolfgang Petersen’s 1991 thriller Shattered , with Tom Berenger. Good stuff, GREAT twist. And if you want to see Gellar deal with unexplained memory problems in an only-sort-of-horror setting, watch The Return , which is far more interesting than this movie (and inches closer to horror territory to boot). What say you? P.S. I learned later that the film is (sigh) a remake of an Asian film. Anyone seen it? Actually horror? Many folks will mistakenly, but understandably, refer to Hatchet as Adam Green's debut film, but it's actually his second. His FIRST film was Coffee &amp; Donuts , which was shot for 400 dollars using "borrowed" equipment from the cable company that he and trusty DP Will Barratt (who has shot all of Green's films) made in 1999. The film showed at a single film festival (where it won Best Picture) and fell through the cracks as a result of (sadly aborted) attempts to turn it into a sitcom. Thus, the film hasn't been shown since, but that is about to change. This Thursday, March 18th, the (where else?) New Beverly Cinema will be showing Coffee &amp; Donuts for the first time in a movie theater (or at all, really) in over a decade-. But first, Green will present his excellent new film Frozen in glorious 35mm, complete with a Q&amp;A with the cast (all three of the chair-bound heroes, as well as Kane Hodder). He will also be showing a few of his legendary Halloween short films. And if we bug him enough, maybe he'll talk a bit about Hatchet 2 (which is now in post-production!). The whole shebang costs 7 measly bucks, and you can buy your tickets online HERE (which is a good idea since it's very likely that the show will sell out). See you there! -Please note that C&amp;D will be a digital projection, as it was shot digitally in the first place. Again though, Frozen will be a 35mm print. MARCH 12, 2010 GENRE: GHOST SOURCE: THEATRICAL (PRESS SCREENING) Now THIS is a good romantic horror movie! Unlik
 yesterday's To Die For , Conor McPherson's The Eclipse takes time to develop its characters, which not only makes the story far more interesting, but also allows for the scares (which, to be fair, are fairly limited - more on that later) to really work; I must admit I got jolted twice, whereas I'm usually amazed if they can get me once. The film concerns a would-be writer (Ciarán Hinds) who volunteers for the annual literature festival in a seaside town in Ireland. He gets directly involved with two of the authors: a celebrity novelist played by Aidan Quinn, and a horror novelist (Iben Hjejle), with whom Quinn had a one night stand with some time before (and wants to continue the affair). So yeah - it doesn't exactly scream horror, but that's actually what makes it work. There are only five attempts at scares in the entire movie, two of which made me jump and one (the first) just plain creeped me out. And the reason they work so good is that the love triangle plot was compelling enough for me to keep forgetting that there was a horror element to the proceedings, catching me off guard. Now, because the focus is on the romance/character study, "horror and nothing else" fans will probably hate the film (expect to see the word "boring" thrown around a lot if you read any reviews). The horror elements are never really expanded upon - don't look for a scene where Hinds fights the ghost or digs up town records in order to find a bunch of exposition, because it's not there. All of the ghost appearances are the result of his character's guilt manifesting itself. For example, the first couple of "appearances" seem to be of his (still living) father-in-law, who is in a nursing home and was left behind when the festival began (Hinds forgot to pick him up). Most movies would just have this sort of character flaw play out in a normal way - Hinds would realize his error and call the guy to apologize, or drink, or whatever. In this movie he gets pulled into the ground by a bloodied arm (whether the apparitions are real or psychological is never explained, nor does it matter). But they never go beyond that - brief but largely successful scares that help reflect the character's state of mind. Hinds is terrific in the film. He's in all but one or two scenes, and those non-Hinds scenes suggest that the film will be a complete study of all three characters, but ultimately the film is solely about his character's grief (his wife died before the film began - hence why he is in charge of looking after his father-in-law) and how he tries to put himself out there after living in borderline seclusion for so long. It's a sad portrait (Quinn provides the film with its few moments of humor), which could border on depressing with a less appealing actor in the role, but Hinds makes it not only watchable, but enjoyable. You really feel for the guy and want him to break out of his shell. My only quibble is that they suggest some stuff and never really develop it into a meaningful plot thread. Hjejle's character writes ghost novels, and they sort of suggest that she, like Hinds, is haunted by apparitions as well, but never go beyond that hint. Granted, the film is about Hinds' growth, but it seems odd to bring it up and not do anything with it; she could have just as easily been a romance novelist for all the purpose her horror background serves to the story. I guess we can assume that Hinds takes an interest in her because he thinks she can help him understand why he is seeing these things, but she's also a very attractive woman in his age group (not that he fawns all over her), so I don't think anyone in the audience would think much of it if they struck up a friendship without any supernatural-based connotations. Then again it's also an incredibly short film (88 minutes), so maybe there was more to it and it was cut to keep the focus on Hinds (and again, keep the audience from thinking they were watching a traditional horror movie). Magnolia is putting this one out, which means it will probably debut on VOD at the same time as its theatrical release. I'm sure it will play just as well at home (I doubt it will be playing in more than a handful of screens across the country), but if it IS in a theater near you, see it that way. Magnolia has consistently released interesting genre fare over the past few years, and I don't want them to abandon theatrical releases due to everyone simply watching them On Demand. One final note - I find it ironic that, after July, another Eclipse will be considered the standard for a "romantic" horror film by millions of teen girls. BUT, I take some pleasure in imagining that come Christmas (when both films will be on DVD), some clueless aunt or grandparent will buy the "wrong" Eclipse for their 15 year old relative. "Aidan Quinn what? Who? Where the hell is Taylor Lautner, Grandma?" What say you? P.S. This is my 100th "Ghost" movie review! Hurrah! It joins Slashers, Comedic, Monster, Supernatural, and Psychological films in the "Century Club". Zombies should join the club next. MARCH 14, 2010 GENRE: GHOST SOURCE: NETFLIX (INSTANT VIEW) For years I had heard of The Entity as “the movie where she gets raped by a ghost”, but I always assumed that this was sort of a spoiler; an event that the film built toward (not unlike describing It’s A Wonderful Life as being about a guy who sees what life would be like without him). So I was surprised to see it happen pretty much in the first 10 minutes of the movie. “OK, but NOW what?” I asked the TV. The TV ignored me and kept on playing the movie, but I soon had my answer: not much. Granted, the film is based on allegedly true events, so I can’t knock it for being a bit inert, but I CAN knock it for being over two hours long when it repeats a lot of stuff. Two scenes of the ghost following her to her friend’s house, at least four of her talking to Ron Silver (who believes she is just crazy), several more rapes, etc. It’s not a bad movie by any means, but I felt like it sort of started at one level and never really went higher. I think a touch more development prior to the first haunting, and then some editing (really, just remove any 20 minute chunk in the middle of the film) could have resulted in an even better film. But it’s still a pretty good one. True or not, the ordeal is pretty terrifying, elevating it above the usual haunted house type movie. The first time we see Barbara Hershey’s body being poked and prodded by unseen hands (a Stan Winston effect, if I’m understanding the credits correctly) is not only a terrific effect in the technical sense, but also a creepy one. The tricky subject matter keeps the film from having any real sense of humor (though I must admit I laughed when Silver asked if the ghost ejaculated, partially because of his deadpan expression, and partly because I think the idea of ghost jizz is pretty funny), so even when the story occasionally dips into Poltergeist territory, the tone is unlike it or any other haunting/ghost film I can recall. And as with Emily Rose or (to a lesser extent) Haunting in Connecticut , I liked that they provided enough plausible “evidence” for me to consider that Hershey maybe was just crazy. Silver has a reasonable explanation for pretty much everything, and it’s a concrete fact that her character suffers some serious sexual hang-ups (molested by her stepfather, impregnated as a teenager by a man twice her age, etc), so his theories certainly hold water, at least for a while (the scene in her friend’s apartment sort of solidifies the “it’s a ghost” idea once and for all). The ending was a bit of a letdown though. Again, the film never really builds tension or suspense, but there is at least an attempt at a climax when Hershey is placed in a replica of her house, albeit one equipped with liquid helium tanks that will hopefully freeze the ghost while she remains safely inside a contained area (so it hinges on the ghost being kind of gullible, I guess). But the “attack” is fairly brief, and Silver never really has that “Oh shit, she was RIGHT!” moment that I think we deserve after listening to him argue with our heroine for the entire movie. Sidney J. Furie directed the film. You may know him from the Iron Eagle films and a couple of late period Dolph Lundgren films. Entity is one of his rare dips in horror (he’s also billed as an uncredited director of Devil Doll ), which is a shame as I would have liked to have seen one where he was allowed to have a little more fun without being tacky/insensitive. Half the movie seems to be shot in canted angles, and there are a lot of De Palma esque di-opter shots to enjoy (thank CHRIST for once Netflix offered a widescreen transfer for an instant viewing, and the quality was pretty good as well). I think he could have made a terrific, or at least, very stylish, slasher movie. Sadly, he seems to have retired (he had to exit his last film for health reasons, and he directed his first film over 50 years ago!), so I doubt we’ll get one. Hopefully he’s at least back in good health. This showed at midnight at the New Bev a few months ago, and I missed it for some reason, but I’m glad I caught it at home. Not only would the length have guaranteed some dozing, but it’s not really a midnight type movie. I caught Irreversible there at midnight, and while the movie was quite good, it didn’t have that crowd experience that I associate with midnight screenings. If I’m gonna drive around LA at 2 am (where the bullshit LAPD never bothers to stop people that are driving without their headlights, a scarily common sight in Hollywood and even on the 101 freeway), I want to have a good time more than I want to see a good movie. What say you? MARCH 13, 2010 GENRE: HAUNTED HOUSE , WEIRD SOURCE: THEATRICAL (REVIVAL SCREENING) You might wonder why I would knock on something like The Box for being a bunch of nonsense, and yet praise Hausu ( House ) for being a bunch of nonsense. Well, the answer is simple: as someone who prefers story to anything else, I felt annoyed by Richard Kelly turning the intriguing and unique concept of The Box into yet another baffling Kelly-ish narrative about vessels and mathematics and whatever the fuck else was going on. But in Hausu’s case, I’ve seen the basic plot (teens visiting an isolated house that turns out to be haunted) a million times, so the batshit, incomprehensible-by-design nature of it allowed me to be entertained by the story all over again. If I had to “pitch” the movie to someone, I would probably say it was David Lynch’s version of Evil Dead 2 , or maybe The Grudge as written by James Joyce. Blending animation, splatter, outright nonsense (a dancing skeleton, for example), typical haunted house motifs, and screwball comedy antics into a single film, Nobuhiko Obayashi has created a stream-of-conscious horror comedy that simply must be seen to be believed, and even then you’ll probably figure you were dreaming part of it up. “Did I really just see a piano eat a girl?” you might ask yourself after the film has concluded. Yes. Yes you did. The film’s structure sort of defies reviewing, or even my usual sort of “reactionary” type posting. It’s all so rambunctious and free-flowing, I’m hard-pressed to even bring up a specific scene. Images certainly stick out, such as a cracked mirror flowing with blood (very cool), or the kung-fu expert character (named Kung Fu) taking on a phone that explodes, but I can no longer recall their context. I could probably watch the movie a dozen times and still not have any better understanding of it, but I know for sure that a single viewing is simply not enough to PROCESS everything. The editing is rapid-fire, the girls never really pause in between their lines, and it’s got a pretty crowded cast (about a dozen main characters) despite only being 87 minutes long. Some of the stylistic flourishes are a bit annoying though. At one point, the film appears to have been shot at maybe 12 frames per second, which would be fine for a quick “scare” shot, but it’s used for a lengthy tracking shot consisting of the girls trying to exit the house and make a phone call, while talking. It gave me a bit of a headache, honestly. Perhaps it was an error that they couldn’t afford or didn’t have the time/cast to reshoot, but it’s a blight all the same. Many of the flashes are a delight though, such as the odd super-impositions, frequent closing irises (I muttered “The...end...” several times), and blending of live action with animated/rotoscoped characters/objects. Both Brian De Palma and Michael Bay would probably find Obayashi’s whims to be excessive. Needless to say, if you’re one of the types of people who think Armageddon ’s editing or De Palma’s split-screen effects are the bane of cinema, you shouldn’t even look at the poster for Hausu. Everyone else though, by all means, go see the film. If you’re in Los Angeles, you can check it out at the New Bev until March 17th (two shows a night!), and I’m pretty sure other cities will be playing it as well, as Janus has struck a new print for it. There’s a UK DVD with some nice extras, including lengthy interviews with Obayashi; hopefully it will be ported to the US soon (the UK one is linked below for you Region 2 capable folks). I think seeing it with an equally bewildered crowd is part of the fun, but even if you have to settle for seeing it on a 13 inch TV in your kitchen, your life will still be the better for having seen it. What say you? P.S. If you have seen the film, you know that the theme song is both wonderful and haunting. And if you have seen the film AND are one of those techie geniuses, please make it into a ringtone for me (preferably the “Cat’s Meow” variant). Thanks. If you missed the "premiere", or just can't get enough, HMAD Live Tweeting will return on March 17th (a Wednesday) at 6:30 PST (9:30 Eastern). This time, the movie will be Zombie Death House (available on Netflix instant view ), which is directed by THE John Saxon (as if there could be another). As before, simply start the movie along with me and follow my live commentary on the official HMADLiveTweet Twitter page. Yay technology! See you then!
We'll have a half-and-half session this Sunday, courtesy Amit Varma and Mahesh Murthy (who's already done one quiz for us this season). It's IPL time, so please try to be there on time, so that we won't hold back all the eager T20 fans from their frenzy. :) Quizmaster: Amit Varma, Mahesh Murthy When: 3 PM, Sunday, 14 March 2010 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W). Directions: From the south: If you come north on Linking Road from Bandra to SantaCruz, you'll find a large Benetton Store on the right. At the end of that block is a Kotak Bank at the corner. Take a right and it's the next building, take the first gate and tell the sentry you've come for the quiz. From the north: If you get on to Linking Road at the airplane park end, you'll cross a HDFC Bank. A block later, you'll see a Kotak Bank on the corner - do not cross it. Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. We haven't been too regular about updating the blog announcements and results for quite a while now. But that doesn't mean we haven't been quizzing - so we'll try and catch up on the results and league standings as soon as possible. Meanwhile, it's quizzing as usual on Sunday, and Abhinav Dasgupta, who filled in on short notice in December (thanks, mate!) will do a proper quiz this weekend. The short quiz was good fun, so we should certainly expect more of the same this time around. Details and directions below. Quizmaster: Abhinav Dasgupta When: 3 PM, Sunday, 28 February, 2010 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W).

Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. The folks at the Celebrate Bandra Festival asked us to put together a quiz for this year's edition. Details below - and cash prizes are there. I'm not sure how much, but it should be worth the early escape from work. The quiz, that is. We all know real quizzers don't get rich. ;-) Quizmaster: Sumant Srivathsan Research: Anannya Deb, Amit Pandeya and others. :) When: 4:30 PM, Saturday, 28 September, 2009 Where: Crossword Bookstore, Linking Road, Bandra Teams: Two or fewer members, no bars of any kind. Until after the quiz. Atulya Bharadwaj will do his quiz this Sunday, as we get into the thick of quizzing season. We will start an hour later than usual (see the new time below) as many of the regulars will be in South Bombay attending Dhananjay Shettigar's JBIMS Quiz . Dhananjay tells me that he will finish by 2 PM, which should give us all adequate time to get back to Santacruz for our regular season. For those who plan to be in Bangalore for the next season of the Landmark Quiz, this should be a great chance to sharpen your skills.

Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. Once upon a time, a fellow quizzer and I shared a desk in school. Since then, we have both grown large enough to no longer fit in such a desk. But Bombay is a big city, and it can accommodate many such large types. Sumo hosts his first BQC session on Sunday, and as always, it should be a cracker.

Are you like me? Unsure? Read on, and find out! Are you tired of all these self proclaimed self help books that discourage you from living in fear? Are you tired of being told that going out, doing things, and meeting real people, is for some reason, objectively better than your natural inclination to stay in every night? Are you tired of being made to feel like your desire to never leave the house again is wrong? Did you answer yes to one or more of these questions, but are afraid to admit to people that this is how you really feel? If so, good news! You are like me! And it truly is great news, because I've written just the book for me. Since also you're just like me, it's almost like you wrote this book, for you ! It's kind of sad that we're pioneering new ground in the "self help" industry by putting the "self" back in "self help". But hey, let them worry about it. I've entitled the book "I'm Afraid I'll Stay the Way I Am, Thank You Very Much" and between its' covers, you'll find all sorts of words, which I have arranged in a specific fashion,to empirically and conclusively demonstrate that what we may loosely define as "mental illness" is a quality to not only be embraced, but celebrated. I invite you to journey with me, from the first page to the last, and bear witness as I dispel some of the age old myths like -Real friends are better than imaginary ones -Healthy love involves at least two people -Talking is more than just noise -There's no reason to be afraid of spiders -A penny earned is a penny saved In addition, I will show you several secret techniques on how to: -Build a working E-meter -Construct an 'anxiety free zone' in the comfort of your own home, using only string and a pair of safety scissors -Take out your frustrations over your own ineptitude on moderately relevant acquaintances in meticulous plotted attacks -Instigate mass hysteria Listen. The only way they can keep you down is if you're playing their game. So do yourself a favor and stop it. Make your own game and play it instead. There's no reason that you should be afraid to be yourself. Fear change instead... it's way scarier. HI HI HI it is your old frend Joachim Jaeger here to make your new years with even more smiles. I am to be tasked with updating of this blog for entire year of 20 08, so let see how it go! Today It is wensday and that is meaning comics books day of the week. This week is very special comics books day because it is meaning Hulk #1 is for sale!!! Yes friends the hulk is return but all new, different than previous. Now hulk is red. yes red, like the colour you see. It is similar to orange, but not quite as yellow. What could happen to make such strange circumstance, you ask? It is fortunate you wonder on this for all you shall find here is solutions to your own imaginings. And it is this. The hulk is not the hulk. Brace Bannerman is locked up in arrmys aquarium. So who is to be this new hulk who burns with the fires of a thousand chernobyls? It is shitbag, rick jones. They dont SAY, but they say. It is mystery but I solve, okay? Overall, i do not buy.

this photo was the first one that I took with my Panasonic G1 This site is a member of: City Daily Photo  Here's someone watching one of the films at the Star City exhibition.  I didn't really stop to watch what it was about, as I was more interested in capturing the different angles and shapes.

I don't know what it is about.  Freedom fighters for battery hens perhaps! Or advertising some new nightclub in town.  Whatever it is about, it makes for quite an interesting piece of art.I saw it this morning on the way in to work, and it was still there at lunchtime.

So here are two lovely ladies getting wet under the water feature in the Market Square.
to conduct some full-page interviews with people I never thought I'd talk to. For the September issue, I yakked on the horn with the still very much bad-ass Ice Cube. Out this month, my interview with stripper-obsessed impresario T-Pain. And in December, they'll print my conversation with Stone Temple Pilot Scott Weiland.And to cap this very good day off -- Obama even won Indiana! -- this week's newly published Time Out New York features my interview with Paul Rudd, who is more awesome than Joe Biden's mother.To celebrate all this good news -- although after staying out until 3am last night, I probably don't need any more of that -- I am listening to my new favorite song by the Flaming Lips, which isn't at all new, as you'll no doubt see by this straight-outta-the-early-1990s video:WHY I'M ANGRY TODAYI've tried, but I am finding that it is impossible to be angry today!
I've been recording and posting some brief (for me) monologues on YouTube, starting with Space Exploration Part 1 - Planning our next steps in beyond Earth &nbsp; ... followed by Space Exploration Part 2 - Mining the sky: Are there economic incentives out there? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then Space Exploration Part 3: The Big Picture, Where is the excitement? And what about warp drive? Finally, and just posted, there is Space Exploration Part 4: Ambitious technologies for space: Space tethers, solar sails and space elevators. More space-related postings will go up soon, plus some fun rants about SETI, andon the (crazy) notion of &quot;cycles&quot; of falling civilizations. Nature interviews David Brin on scientists writing fiction. I was also interviewed for the new documentary &ldquo;The People vs. George Lucas.&rdquo; &nbsp; I have no idea - yet - whether they used their footage of me appropriately.&nbsp; I attempted to be circumspect and speak well of Lucas -- where he deserved it. For example, I loved the &ldquo;Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&rdquo; and adored &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back.&rdquo;&nbsp; So my disappointment in the films that followed came honestly... leading to my participation as editor and &ldquo;prosecutor&rdquo; in the book STAR WARS ON TRIAL . (by far the best and most fun way to explore these issues!) Those guys at the SETI Institute sure have chutzpah!&nbsp; They plan to tun their first SETIcon August 13-15 at the Hyatt Regency, Santa Clara. &ldquo;The Search for Life in the Universe in Science Fact and Science Fiction!&rdquo; Thus perpetuating the myth that they love science fiction.... only don&rsquo;t mention any possibility that the universe might -- just might -- be different, even slightly, than their standard model.&nbsp; Watch how quickly any alternate scenario is dismissed as &ldquo;crazy science fiction stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anybody planning to attend? Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it should be fun and interesting in its own right.&nbsp; The topic has fascinated my, all my life and I am glad the are pursuing the worthy search... (as opposed to some of their other, cultlike activities.)&nbsp; But if anyone is interested in some questions to raise....

(Sorry to have missed that. It's 3am Mountain and am Central.) Set your Tivo to a wide window, just in case! (See my previous entry for description. Anybody know a likely sponsor? ;-) Or copies can be ordered from the HC web site. -------- Heck, while I'm at it....here are some shocking items. -------- Want the current economic crisis explained? See my friend (and extremely smart world pundit) Mark Anderson offer some unusual insights. -------- Those of you who thrilled to the “big dog” robot video really ought to see the satire . ===AND NOW, FROM THE TRANSPARENCY FRONT=== Turning our gaze upon our paid protectors -- From Boing Boing: NYPD cops videoed illegally warring on photographers: This video compilation of numerous near-simultaneous arrests in NY is a nice example of how consumer technologies can help to balance abuse of authority. A fascinating study in the trend I forecast, of smart mobs holding authority accountable. This is how we'll get truly professional police. And yet... And yet, I have to tell you that I have decidedly mixed feelings. Yes, the lapses in professionalism -- and outright lies -- of the cops deserve nailing. They must learn (apparently with some difficulty) to live in a world of cameras... and rights. Still, the scenes depicted were drenched in the drug high of self-righteous indignation on both sides. There were scores of people in Time Square just itching for a confrontation, heckling, taunting and veering in front of guys who are... at a deep level... just human males high on adrenaline. Yes, the woman who would not show her ID was within her rights. But she could have given them their little ritual of control, and they had already proved that would likely be enough. I want to emphasize, I am on the side of the smart mob. But I would betray this movement if I weren't able to criticize it. These things need to be smarter, calmer, and far more mature. ----- I contributed to Game Development Essentials: An Introduction (and followup volumes.) If you want to develop games... and that's it for now. Andi Tobin wrote in to say "I just noticed The ArchiTECHS is on The History Channel at 5 a.m. on May 2." I have the distinction of having been on the History Channel's top... and bottom... rated shows ever. "Life After People" was a huge success, and I'm still doing interviews about it, phoned in to New Zealand and Australia. History promoted it like mad, but there's also something deeply resonant about a show that portrays the world recovering after humanity somehow blows it. Suits the mood of the 21st Century, so far. In contrast, "The Architechs" was a design show... that "challenged five geniuses to solve an impossible problem in 48 hours... to innovate more than a dozen new fire rescue and evacuation tools for skyscraper disasters." History never promoted the show and aired it one weekday night at 10pm. Well, well. If end-of-the-world sells better than problem-solving, I'll do end-of-the-world! Still, Tivo "The Architechs" if you can. (And tell friends! This may be their last chance.) You may enjoy a little dive back into the oldtimey can-do spirit. A spirit of optimistic problem-solving we might do well to bring back, sometime soon. ---- (Feel free to continue your previous arguments in comments below...)

e.The next part of the problem is figuring out how to test for unbounded sequences. A good approximation can be reached by running through n iterations and quitting if the magnitude of z exceeds 2. The magnitude of a complex number with real part a and imaginary part b is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). For simple graphs, a reasonable value for n is 100.Here's what a simple Mandelbrot set grapher in JavaScript looks like: for (var x = 1; x     for (var y = 1; y       var count = 0;      var size = 0;      var cx = xcorner + ((x * zoom) / this.width);      var cy = ycorner + ((y * zoom) / this.height);      var zx = 0;      var zy = 0;      while (count         count += 1;        temp = (zx * zx) - (zy * zy);        zy = (2 * zx * zy) + cy        zx = temp + cx;        size = (zx * zx) + (zy * zy);      }      this.Plot(x, y, count); // count serves as a good color hint.    }  }By setting the xcorner, ycorner, and zoom variables, the above code allows you to pan across and zoom into various points in the set. To accommodate for pretty visualizations, you can use count to determine the color of the pixel.A barebones implementation is available here: mandelbrot.js. Although it is not a very efficient implementation, it is very simple, and if you squint hard enough, you can see how the code relates to the visualization.The Mandelbrot Set Generator is a harness I built with mandelbrot.js. Play with the parameters and let me know if you find anything interesting. It also turns out to be a good br

New Media Manitoba (NMM) held their 2009 Holiday Showcase at the IMAX Theatre, Portage Place yesterday evening. It was delightful (and inspiring) to see local digital media practitioners on the IMAX big screen. The sold-out event was well attended by a diverse range of local professionals, and proved to be an excellent place to meet and converse, with individuals who were truly passionate about their respective crafts/industries. The highlight/feature of the evening was the approximate 45 minute, NMM Business Showcase video(s) produced by BlinkWorks: Film and Video Production , you can check out the videos via BlinkWorks' website , here ). Andrew Boardman 's (MGDC, GDC Manitoba Chapter Membership Chair), MANOVERBOARD was one of the local companies profiled, check out the profile video embedded above or on on Vimeo , here . Be sure to check out the other videos as well at BlinkWorks: Film and Video Production . You can see my photos from the NMM 2009 Holiday Showcase (Photoset) on Flickr . Cheers! A few months have passed since the grand opening of Winnipeg's greenest , eco-friendly salon, Berns & Black located at 468 Main Street (in the old Birt Saddlery building - Main and Bannatyne)... it has now become my salon destination of choice . ;) Check out this video (taken before the grand opening) I came across on Youtube ... A number of factors influenced my decision... but, mainly, it's conveniently located in the Exchange District (within walking distance from Circle ), it's dedicated to being eco-friendly(+) &#8211; plus, the staff, service, product selection (and decor) is second to none. On my most recent visit, I took the opportunity to take a few quick pics ... my apologies as they really don't do the space justice. The decor is very cool IMO... Hanging on one of the walls was this shadow-box display, housing authentic tools from Anthony Berns Barbershop (c.1951) . :D Berns & Black offers salon and spa services (including straight razor shaves for men)... I highly recommend that you check it out! If you're looking for a new stylist, ask for Kitty... you won't be disappointed (tell her I sent 'ya) . You can read more about Berns & Black online via the Winnipeg Free Press and the Winnipeg Sun , here and here . Berns & Black is open at 9:00 am Monday thru Saturday (closing hours vary), walk-ins are welcome, but pre-booking is recommended. For more information, or to book an appointment call (204) 944 8454. Cheers! David Thorne is an Australian humorist, satirist, internet personality and author. I was recently introduced to his work via a link my brother sent me... where he came across it, I'm not sure. 27b/6 is his website, which you can read more about on Wikipedia ... Anyhow, the link my brother sent me was to a recent post on 27b/6 , which seemed to address the issue of spec work (visit http://www.no-spec.com/ ). I couldn't help but laugh after reading this . If you're a designer, or in the creative field, I'm sure that you've been asked (at least once) to do work on spec... most of us just say no, although I'm sure that we've been tempted to say more . ;) Thanks for the link bro! Visit 27b/6 and read the post yourself ... enjoy! I'm sure that this video , posted to Vimeo by John Carrera , has made it's way around the 'blogosphere' already, but it's just too cool to not post about. Like the folks over at GOOD magazine , I could watch this video , over and over again, and still be left in awe. Enjoy!
Since I am aging and becoming Totally Old, I would like a throbbing forehead vein like Clint Eastwood and various telekinetic manga characters. A throbbing forehead vein - is that too much to ask? If I had a rec room, I would want either a swanky home bar with Christmas lights and old school beer signs or a massive model railroad set. And if I had a 10,00,000 square foot rec room? I would want something like Miniatur Wonderland (pronounced "mini-ah-toor vunderland") in Hamburg, Germany, the largest model railway in the fricking world. If I couldn't have my own Miniatur Wonderland - because I'm not building that thing - I would settle for Minotaur Wonderland, a magical realm of daydreams and lollypops and prancing minotaurs, or a massive retractable roof in my huge rec room so Harrier jets and my rocketpack commandos could land. I've said it many times: one must have goals in life. Miniatur Wonderland: give to me! June 15, 2009 - Los Angeles after the Lakers' NBA Championship win. June 15, 2009 - Tehran after sham elections and murderous crackdown on protesters. Being a cop in the future would be bad-ass. You get to wear riot gear, fly around on jet packs, and whack civilians with sick sticks or stun guns. Future cops also get the coolest rides - at least in science fiction movies. Here are the most kick ass and suck ass futuristic police vehicles ever, according to Me.- Police Spinner - Blade Runner Designed by the legendary Syd Mead, the police spinner is a ground/air patrol car loaded with 300 lbs of red and blue beacon lights. Judging from the picture above, the spinner is powered by steam vents and suspension wires. Who drives it: Edward James Olmos , puta . Why it is cool: Look at it. It's fucking cool, Syd Mead designed it. The spinner was created using practical effects and a full scale prop, which automatically makes it cooler than any digitally created futuristic police vehicle. Why it sucks: The spinner has scissor doors that open vertically (see above) which just lets in all that futuristic acid rain. The Pursuit Special - Mad Max and Road Warrior This tricked out, all black 1974 Ford Falcon XB coupe gets jacked by Max in Mad Max for his mission of vengeance, and he just keeps the thing during the subsequent biker apocalypse in the Road Warrior . With a 351 V8 engine, a gnarly blower, and double spoilers, it is pretty much one giant surrogate penis. Often incorrectly identified as a "V8 Interceptor" due to a line of dialogue spoken by a mechanic in Road Warrior, it is actually identified as a Pursuit Special in Mad Max , so that's what I'm calling it and oh God I have no life. Who drives it: Max Why it is cool: I just explained why it's cool. The Pursuit Special is the automotive wet dream of an entire generation of Aussie gearheads . Why it sucks: N/A MFP Interceptor - Mad Max Some time in the not to distant future the Australian federal highway police force known as the Main Force Patrol will cruise the badlands in bright yellow 1974 Ford Falcons. It will happen, mark my words. In 1979's Mad Max , our hero Max Rockatansky drive the bad ass V8 Interceptor - at least until he graduates to the Pursuit Special. Who drives it: Officer Max Rockatansky . His name is on the side of his Interceptor, as well as his nickname: "The Dark One." Why it is cool: For starters, the color scheme is awesome. Lettering on the back of each patrol car reads either PURSUIT or, in Max's case, INTERCEPTOR. Plus, the car appears in Mad Max , the mother of all dystopian futuristic highway patrol revenge flicks. Why it sucks: This is what I'm telling you, it doesn't suck. It's not quite as cool as the Pursuit Special, though, is it? Hill Valley Police Squad Car - Back to the Future II In the year 2015, female police officers will patrol the town of Hill Valley in hover-equipped squad cars and futuristic motorcycles. The cops in Back to the Future II don't seem to be terribly effective, but they have sweet rides. Who drives it: Unit N11-11 (below) Why it is cool: The sloping, aerodynamic pod shape of the Hill Valley PD squad cars are the main selling point. They look like melted jelly beans. Why it sucks: They don't do anything particularly spectacular, and the special effect sequence (pictured) of the hovering squad car looks dated. I'm nitpicking. Lawmaster motorcycle - Judge Dredd The Lawmaster is the vehicle of choice for MegaCity One's fascist Judges, who enforce strict bans on things like sugar and coffee. Normal motorcycles aren't cool enough for Judges - they prefer cruising around in these tricked out, unwieldy Lawmaster monstrosities. Why? Because they look bad ass. Who drives it: Judges Why it is cool: Look at that thing, it's ridiculous. The design is so over the top that you have to love it. It's like a jumbo action figure accessory. Why it sucks: I think it needs much fatter tires in order to look truly cool. San Angeles Police Patrol Car - Demolition Man The pathetically ineffectual pacifistic cops of the futuristic megalopolis of San Angeles roll around in cool carbon-fiber police cars looking for kittens to rescue or trash to pick up. That's how they roll in the Sylvester Stallone film Demolition Man , which features GM Ultralite low emission concept cars. Maybe GM should have been making these things instead of Hummers, n'est - ce pas? Who drives it: Sandra Bullock Why it is cool: As Stallone demonstrates, if you crash one of these babies, the inside is instantly filled with expanding crash foam that absorbs the impact. That's a nice feature, unless you have issues with being entombed in asphyxiating foam. Why it sucks: See "who drives it." NYPD Cruiser - The Fifth Element The production design in Luc Besson's could-have-been-awesome The Fifth Element is clearly the flim's greatest redeeming feature - that and Gary Oldman's crazy haircut. One of the great things about Fifth Element is the use of models and practical special effects for their hover cars - as a result, they look more solid and real than CG effects. Who drives it: Cops in ridiculously bulky outfits . Why it is cool: I like the retro-futuristic vibe these vehicles have. If Dick Tracy was a 23rd century cop he would totally drive one of these babies. They come equipped with neat communications gear, a handy sliding side door and a winch/pulley system for mid-air prisoner transfer. Why it sucks: They look a little bloated, like pregnant Spinners, but I think that was the effect the filmmakers were going for. Iowa State Patrol hovercycle - Star Trek A couple things you need to know about Future Iowa: a) it's a desert wasteland, b) it has deep canyons/quarries, and c) it's patrolled by motorcycle cops. Who drives it: Scary cyborg looking cops on hoverbikes who like the Beastie Boys. Why it is cool: While the scene in question may be more than a little goofy, the hoverbike design is cool as hell. Why it sucks: Come on, a 23rd Century rocket bike can't catch a kid in an antique car? Laaame . PreCrime Hovership - Minority Report This one kind of blurs the line between police car, helicopter, and hair dryer. Regardless, the hover units in Minority Report do qualify as futuristic police vehicles, so I'll throw them in. It doesn't mean I have to like it. Who drives it: Dept. of PreCrime officers. You thought I was going to make a Scientology joke, didn't you? Too easy. Why it is cool: I don't know, they're kind of neat looking I guess. They do look a little familiar... Why it sucks: Let's just say Boba Fett is suing for copyright infringement. Idiot Cop Car - Idiocracy I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen Idiocracy but I'm including this futuristic police vehicle because I'm in love with the logo. Who drives it: Idiots. Why it is cool: Look at that logo! That is straight pimpin '. Why it sucks: Does it suck? The blinged out logo alone redeems the vehicle. Riot Control Garbage Truck - Soylent Green In the future, you'll be so goddamn hungry you won't even ASK where your food comes from. Who drives it: 14th Precinct Riot Control cops / food industry workers. Why it is cool: It scoops up hippies, dumps them in the back, and then makes food out of them. That's hot. Why it sucks: There are starving kids in China! Stop criticizing the Riot Control Garbage Trucks and eat your soylent green, youngster! Sandman Ground Car - Logan's Run TV series Sure, the 1976 film Logan's Run was awesome, but do you remember the spin-off TV series? They ran with the original concept but surgically removed everything about the original movie that made it unique and cost money. Instead of taking place in a bizarre future city with expensive sets, the Logan's Run TV show took place almost entirely in a park in Southern California. Cool car, though. Who drives it: The ground car was driven by Sandmen, fascist cops who ensure population control by making sure that everyone who reaches the age of 30 takes a once-in-a-lifetime spin on the lethal Carousel. Why it is cool: The Ground Car has a charming antiquated futuristic design and lots of stickers! The gull wing doors scream THIS CAR IS TOTALLY FROM THE FUTURE. Why it sucks: It's called a "Ground Car," which seems redundant. I bet the Sandmen also have Water Boats and Sky Airplanes. Detroit Police Patrol Cars - Robocop Rumour has it that Robocop was supposed to drive his own custom police car in the 1987 film Robocop , but director Paul Verhoeven thought the Robocar looked stupid. As a result, our cyborg hero and the Detroit Police drive black 1985 Ford Taurus in the film. Man, the Robocar must have been pretty shitty if this was a better choice. Who drives it: The police of the future! Why it is cool: Umm ... I'm drawing a blank here. Why it sucks: It's a Ford Taurus. ' Nuff said. Grammaton Cleric Pimpmobile - Equilibrium I'm a big fan of Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium , flaws and all. It's got sword fights, gun kata , and a brooding ultra-serious Christian Bale (as opposed to campy, flamboyant Christian Bale). Set in the city-state of Libria where emotions are illegal, Equilibrium focuses on the anti- emo cops know as Grammaton Clerics who roll around in white Cadillacs - the car of the future! Who drives it: Christian Bale, Taye Diggs , Sean Bean. Why it is cool: It's all white? And therefore looks futuristic? Why it sucks: Man, it's like they're not even trying, isn't it? Look at those guys (above). They're embarrassed to be seen riding in the thing. Clearly the producers just didn't have the money to create their own custom cars, so they worked with what they had - and what they had were white Caddies, which are one step up from the pink Cadillacs that Mary Kay cosmetic salespeople drive. Sad. -I didn't include Will Smith's Space Audi from I, Robot because although he is a police detective, he's driving a civilian car, not a marked police car. Same goes for the cool Lexus concept car Tom Cruise drives in Minority Report - not a cop car. Mick Jagger's armored personnel carrier in Freejack doesn't make the list because it's more of a paramilitary vehicle and it is driven by Mick Jagger. Remember when Sam Raimi used to make horror movies? Apparently so does Sam Raimi. Drag Me To Hell is a return to Raimi's schlock horror roots, and that can only be a good thing. Yes, it's a PG-13 horror flick and as a result it sometimes feels like Raimi is holding back on the really sick shit (which we'll get on the unrated DVD version), but I didn't feel like I was watching a watered down Evil Dead movie. Drag Me works despite its relative lack of gratuitous gore and an anemic performance by the lead actress. And do you know why? Because it's a balls-out Sam Raimi horror movie! It's creepy and gross and hilarious and most of all it's just a lot of fun. Need convincing? In this film a toothless corpse gums our screaming heroine's chin while drooling embalming fluid all over her. A stapler is used as a melee weapon. Somebody pukes up an entire kitty. A scarf goes bad. And when a goat shows up in the third act, you just know things are going to go terribly, hilariously wrong. Go check it out. You can't complain about Spider-Man 3 if you don't show up when Raimi actually makes awesome movies. I often look at footage of the wildfires that sweep through the western states and think, "If only we had giant fire fighting robots." I'm not alone, evidently, because designer Jordan Guelde has created plans for a monstrous bright orange arboreal automaton that fights wild fires. The robot is designed to eliminate the fuel that wild fires need to grow - in other words, it chops down trees. Sure, you and I can chop down trees with a chainsaw or axe, but we require things like oxygen and lack of fire to do so. The Forest Fire Clear Cut Robot laughs at our human weakness. It can chop down trees faster and do it more safely than a human crew - theoretically at least. Right now it's just a bunch of pretty computer graphics. But when they start building these things? I want one! Give to me. He's a ten foot super giant with ginger hair and a neck as thick as a Sequoia. He's Stardust, one of the proto-superheroes that appear in Supermen!: The First Wave of Comic Book Heroes 1939-1941 by Greg Sadowski, and he is creepy as hell. Supermen! features an assortment of obscure early superhero comics produced in 1939-41. The comics are glorious, primitive works of pulp science fiction, crude ancestors of the modern superhero. Yet there's something vital and imaginative about these unsophisticated comics which clumsily explore superhero stories and ideas long before they calcified into cliche. And holy shit, some of those early superheroes were bizarre and terrifying. Stardust is certainly unnerving, but nothing matches the sheer weirdness of Fantomah, the face-melting heroine. Like many "heroes" of her time, Fantomah had seemingly unlimited supernatural powers that she used to protect her jungle domain, but what set her apart was her tendency for her face to transform into a hideous grinning skull. Bleach blonde skull face woman! She is a nightmare. Stardust, on the other hand, embodies an entirely different type of weirdness. He's a red haired space giant who lives in a space castle and saves Earth from giant vultures - from space. Stardust's super powers are all over the map, ranging from flight to the ability to transform enemies into worms to a deep, penetrating, inappropriate stare. He also has a HUGE, baby swallowing neck. If Stardust ever perished in the Sahara, scavengers would fight over Stardust's thick, juicy neck. You could feed a pack of hyenas with that neck meat. He should change his name to Neckro. Or Golden Throat. Or Dr. Bigneck. Anyway, you can really get an idea of how freakishly huge Stardust's neck is when the hero saves a helpless and unnamed girl from the space vultures: Nameless Girl, look out! Stardust wants to swallow you! I honestly can't tell if Stardust is meant to be that frickin' huge, or if the artist just had no concept of proportion and perspective whatsoever. Regardless, the end result is strangely compelling. After wiping out the space vultures, Stardust returns to the girl (who begins every phrase with the word "oh") and , looming uncomfortably close and staring at her, he invites her back to his space castle. "Oh, Stardust! I'd be crazy about it!" I'm guessing that Stardust routinely "rescues" women like Oh Girl, takes them back to his star, feeds them fattening foods for a few months, and then eats them. That's just how superheroes rolled back in the late Thirties. Sure, Barack Obama is the first African American president, but did you know that he is also the first laser powered president ? No shit, Obama is powered by a combination of moxie, hope, and 100% pure laser energy. I am totally not making this up. I have proof: poorly Photoshopped stock photographs of the President! Behold Laser Obama.
FOXNews.com - Pelosi Plan to Pass Health Care Without Traditional Vote Riles Critics I cannot believe the politicians we send to office. Are the politicians so afraid of not being reelected that they will not give an up or down vote? I believe that everyone should have access to healthcare, and healthcare needs to be reformed at the most basic level. It frustrates me knowing the politicians do not have the courage to represent the people. It seems every topic is split between the party lines. No politician is working for the good of the people, they are all worried about playing politics. It's actually disgusting. Come November I plan on a clean sweep.... my personal belief is, two terms and you're out. Enough of career politicians, enough of politics as usual, enough of this nonsense. I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening. Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven. Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon's restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I've eaten at a Damon's restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too. Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave..... All in all a pretty full weekend and it's only Sunday morning. The Penguins play tonight at five and I'm already wearing my new white Jordan Staal jersey in anticipation..... lets go Pens Good morning blogosphere......... if any of you have children and are thinking forward to their careers let me make a suggestion. Do not encourage them to be a doctor or lawyer, the real money is in auto repair........ I had my van at my local accessibility dealer to have the lift repaired this week. I needed two toggle switches replaced. the two switch's cost $15 however the labor was two hours at $90 per hour........ imagine my surprise. Do not encourage your kids to go to graduate school or receive doctorates..... purchase them a socket set and a flashlight, put them on the road to financial security early........ $90 an hour damn. 'Theft' of Sidney Crosby's equipment solved I am glad to hear that Sidney Crosby's gear was found and will be returned to him. Hopefully it makes it into the hockey Hall of Fame where it belongs. It was 63° today and the snow has finally melted off most of the sidewalks. So I made it over to Starbucks and had tea this afternoon. It was so nice getting out of the house and enjoying the warmer weather. Maybe winter is finally over, after all it's almost St. Patrick's Day! I could sure go for a Guinness or two about now. The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations..... The last few weeks I have been using my Netflix account to watch a ton of movies... plus the on-demand cable. Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck.... Reebok Canada to pay for return of Crosby's equipment Reebok is offering a $10,000 reward for the no questions return of Sidney Crosby's Olympic gloves and hockey stick. After scoring the overtime goal to give team Canada the gold medal, Sidney dropped his gloves, hockey stick and mouthpiece in celebration. The only thing he got back was his mouthpiece........ Whoever has his equipment should just return it, do the right thing! It's a piece of Canadian history and I'm sure Crosby would like to have it back. BBC News - YouTube adds video captions for deaf Here is a great example of using technology to include individuals with disabilities. Using automatic speech recognition to provide close captioning for YouTube videos makes perfect sense. The technology may not be perfect, but at least it's a start! It would be great if all companies concentrated on inclusion and universal design, hopefully more companies follow Google's example. While watching last night's news I was surprised to see Steelers Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger under investigation again for sexual assault..... It's only been nine months since the last accusation of sexual assault in Nevada. I thought he would be much more cautious in his extra curricular activities. It seems Ben and a bunch of buddies hit several bars and nightclubs in Georgia, near his summer home. I think it's time Big Ben gets a steady girlfriend and forgets about clubbing and drinking with 20 year old girls.... Repeat after me Ben, I will not have sex with strange women in nightclub bathrooms.... your thoughts?
It has been a couple of days since I wrote my last followup blog entry about my dealings with Charter Communications. I appreciate the fact that all of my initial service setup and installation issues were resolved in a professional and high quality manner. Unfortunately, the customer care, service and treatment that I received, was after the multiple problems had already occurred. The customer care, service and treatment after the multiple problems occurred, should have been the customer care, service and treament that I and all customers should receive from our very initial contact with this company. Until Charter Communications takes a good hard look at how some of their customers are treated, from their initial contact through installation of services and beyond , and make some serious changes, they will never being to compete with companies such as Cox Cable and Verizon. Today is our first day here without one box to unpack. I took my last 2 loads of broken down boxes and huge piles of the movers wrapping paper to the recycle center. I was going to start going for my walks again today but it is rather cool and drizzly out. I will start my walks again tomorrow. My foot has been doing better. Actually I have been so busy that I really have not had much time to pay attention to it even if it was hurting. I guess I will have a better idea what shape it is in when I start my walking routine up. For the normal around the house living, it seems to be doing fine. Veronica is just starting the hiring process for future employees at her new store. Everyone seems very excited to have a new store here on the OBX . They are conducting interviews at the local Ramada Inn, in Nags Head. I heard that one politician in the area told Veronica that she could expect approximately 5000 people to show up for the open employment interviews that will be conducted over the next 3 days. From what I have heard, unemployment for this area is extremely high...over 25%. It is hard to believe that in about 45 days, Veronica and I will be heading out to Alaska on our cruise. By the time that our vacation does arrive, we will surely be ready for a nice break. We were invited to a grand opening of a local restaurant near where we live but unfortunately we could not go. I am sure that we will try the restaurant out in the future. It is less than a mile from where we live. They also had a big parade, a car show and a Taste of The Beach Festival going on yesterday but Veronica and I could not go to that either because we had to get the rest of the unpacking done and finished. I am glad we did stay home and got everything done. I am sure that there will be other events that we can go to as time goes by. Later on this week, we will go to take our drivers license test...they have you take a written test around here. Thank God there is no actual driving test given or else I could be in big trouble. Of course even with the written test, I could be in trouble. Never was good with written tests. Might actually have to break down and study. Feels like I am going back to my High School days. Finally....all and I mean every single box has been gone through, emptied, broken down and taken out of this place....except for a few boxes that we decided not to empty...contents weren't needed. My vehicle has about 40 or more boxes broken down in the back of it. I will be going to the Recycle Center first thing in the morning. After dropping off of the boxes, I will return and load the RAV 4 up with all of the movers wrapping paper. We ended up buying ourselves a new couch and a new dining room set. Originally we were going to share an office and Veronica's craft room. Unfortunately after opening all of the craft room moving boxes, it became very apparent that there was just no way that our computers and computer related furniture was going to fit in with all of that craft room items. I could not believe how tight it was in there. It really was unbearable. So after a real brief discussion and I mean brief, we both decided that it would be in our best interest to put our computer room downstairs in the 1st floor spare bedroom. This is the bedroom that we were using for some indoor storage of extra boxes and rubber storage tubs. So this morning, Veronica and I got up early and moved all of our computer stuff downstairs. It will be a while until Veronica has a chance to put her craft room aka "The Studio" together but when she does, she will have a room all her own for her artistic endeavors. I think that I will try to just relax the rest of today because tomorrow I will be on the run again. Below are some photos of our new place: Here are some photos of or bedroom Master bathroom 2 nd floor hallway Here is a photo of "the door". Behind this door evil lies. Actually, behind this door a real mess resides...at least for now...Veronica's art studio 3rd floor landing Living room, dining room, library room and kitchen photos This is our new computer room...rather spacious compared to the cramped room we were in and as a bonus....it will be much cooler in the Summer months Today Veronica and I got up early to tackle our last major obstacle...the craft room. The boxes seem endless and it will probably take most of the day to get close to being done. Hopefully we will get finished within the next 2 days, so that maybe we can take a deep breath and possibly relax for a minute....just a thought..... Shortly after I wrote and posted my last blog entry, I received a comment from an Eric Ketzer . You can view the posted comment by clicking the comments link on my previous blog entry. As it turns out, Mr. Ketzer is the Social Media Communications Manager for Charter Communications. To be honest with you...I was really floored to have had someone locate my blog entry and then take the time to leave a comment and write me, requesting information to help solve a problematic issue. Mr. Ketzer also sent me an email requesting information about my address, the order number and information that applied to my installation. A short while later, I received a telephone call from another Charter representative named Antoine. We ended up on a 4 way conference call with myself, Antoine, Brad(the local installation supervisor) and I believe it was someone from billing. After discussing the situation, it was agreed that Brad and/or another Quality Assurance Technician would be at my home this morning at 9AM. Brad assured me that they would make everything right for me, on the installation aspect of things. The individual, from what I think was billing, told me that Charter Communications would compensate me for our troubles by giving us a free month of total service and there would be no charge for the installation. After the telephone call ended, I felt much better that we were heading in the right direction of getting this matter settled. Brad along with the Quality Assurance Technician arrived here at 9 AM sharp and they went through the complete installation process for all of our services...cable, telephone and internet . They checked whatever work that had been previously done by the last technician, discussed options with me and made all of the appropriate changes so that I would get the maximum level of quality for each service that I ordered. These 2 gentlemen were highly qualified, very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with everything that they did and all of the services that they provided me. I want to publicly thank Charter Communications, Mr. Eric Ketzer , Antoine, the person from billing whom I spoke to on the telephone, Brad the local Installation Supervisor, the QA technician whose name escapes me....sorry...chalk it up to old age...and another young lady by the name of April, for helping turn this negative situation into a very acceptable and positive outcome. I thank you all. Now I can finally make full use of our new Samsung television...life is good and so are the Kansas Jayhawk basketball team... especially in HD...Rock Chalk Jayhawk...Beak'm Hawks!!!! Our move is complete. Everything was delivered to our new home last Friday. The delivery was smooth and uneventful...just the way I like it. Spent 2-3 days running around getting everything unpacked and put away. Luckily there is a recycle center only about 1 1/2 miles up the road. So after rolling up batches of packing paper and taping it into bundles and breaking down all of the boxes, I was busy taking many loads to the recycle center. Unfortunately we have been dealing with a few other problems which have made this move unpleasant up to this point in tie. In a previous blog entry, I had made mention about the trouble I was having getting our car insurance transfered over to North Carolina. The agent that I had been dealing with had made a couple of mistakes when he entered information as far as my address and other important info needed for my insurance. This agent had switched numbers on our PO Box number. Because of this error, it has caused us not to receive any documents from State Farm showing that we indeed have insurance coverage in North Carolina. Every time I called him, he said that he mailed the paperwork to me. After I found out that he had mailed it to the wrong address, I requested that he change all documents to the correct address. Unfortunately this has been difficult to get accomplished at the cooperate level for some reason. We were planning on going to get our drivers license today and I told the agent this, a couple of days ago. He told me that if I call him before I go to DMV , that he would fax the forms over there, to show proof that we had auto insurance. I was not comfortable doing that because we had not had much luck with him getting things done correctly along with the fact that I was afraid that I would not be able to contact him before we headed to get our drivers licenses and even if we did contact him, that we would get to DMV only to find out that he had not faxed over the paperwork that we needed. The bottom line is that I had lost all faith with this agent and was not comfortable dealing with him any longer. Heaven forbid we should have an accident and needed someone that we could depend upon to provide us with the proper service or help us with any insurance needs that we might have. I placed a telephone call to the head of that agency and left a message for him to call me. I did not hear from him until later on the next day and by that time, I had already put into motion a transfers of our auto insurance policies to another agency. Had he called me the same day that I had called him, we would have most likely stayed with his agency but utilized a different agent within his agency. Because of the error of putting the wrong mailing address down initially, it will take a couple of weeks for this all to be settled and straightened out and for all of our auto insurance policies to be transferred over to this new agency. And now for the icing on the cake...Charter Communications. My experiences and frustration with Charter Cable has been previously documented in some earlier blog entries but with yesterdays fiasco, Charter Communications really outdid themselves. Below is a brief synopsis of the customer service that we received from Charter Communications: The tech was running behind and showed up 45 minutes late...3:45...no big deal because it happens all of the time. As soon as he got there, we knew we were in for trouble. The place where we live is brand new. It has all of the wiring within the walls for telephone, cable and internet services. Nothing on the outside has ever been hooked up,so basically the tech is starting from scratch. Right from the start, he is complaining about how behind he is and how many more service calls he has scheduled for the afternoon. He comes inside and looks at the number of telephones that we have...3 to be exact and all are different. The tech tells us that we should have "one main bank" for 3 identical phones to charge in. This would have made his job easier...he made it sound like everyone has a set up like he wants and made us feel that we should go out and buy a system like the one he was speaking about. The tech spent the next 4 hours complaining about the num ber of stairs he was having to climb, the number of times he had to go up and down those stairs, he was on the phone talking to another tech and a sking her if she had heard the crazy lady that he had as a customer earlier in the day and then proceeded to tell me that this lady(another customer) was a lunatic, bitching to me about the number of jumpers that he was putting together and the number of splitters that he had to use. It was just complaint after complaint. After he once again was complaining about him missing other appointments, I told him that his complaint should be with whoever does the scheduling...not with me. The longer he was there, the more tense and stressful the situation became. I found this tech climbing on our bedroom dresser so that he could plug in a cable wire. On several telephone calls that he had with what sounded like other techs, he was heard complaining about the job that he was here for. He complained and blamed us because this job was taking so long, that he was losing money by not being able to get to other installation appointments. Before everything was done, this tech had packed his stuff up and taken it all downstairs to his truck. By this time, there were cable wires laying over our bed, the nightstand was pulled out and had some unknown type of equipment on it...must have something to do with the phone and basically cables laying here there and everywhere. I mentioned to the tech that the upstairs television had not been hooked up to the cable wire and that he did not leave any cable wire for me to hook to tv up to it. It was at this time that things got real nasty. The tech told me "can't you just go out to a store and buy some cable wire" and "are you too cheap to buy some cable wire" and "all of my wire and tools are down in the truck" and "I have already done a bunch of jumpers, splitters and 50 cables for you". I could not believe what I was hearing. I then looked in our office/craft room where our computers are and my desktop had not been hooked up to the internet . I told the tech that this job was not complete. He then stated that he would hook the wire up to my computer...he was saying it in a really sarcastic fashion. We explained to him about all of the things that were not done and about his behavior throughout the 4 hour ordeal. He really did not have much to say about it, other than to reiterate the amount of work that he had to do and the number of appointments that he missed because of us. It became a rather personal thing at thing point. We told him that we were customers too and that the service that he provided was not acceptable. We told him that we wanted a receipt for money that we owed Charter Communications...they take $90 COD and then apply that amount towards your first bill. We got our receipt but refused to sign off on one of the sheets of paperwork that he had. Veronica did sign off on one of the pieces of paperwork but also wrote on it that the job was not complete and that we would be contacting a supervisor. As soon as the tech left, I did file a formal complaint with Charter Communications. After not hearing from anyone this morning, I called Charter Communications back again and spoke to a supervisor. This supervisor was able to pull up my my official complaint from last night, which listed in detail, all of the things that were done, were said and not done by this technician. The supervisor got in touch with the local dispatcher and the local installation supervisor. I am now awaiting a call back from the local installation supervisor so that we can discuss and rectify this situation. Never in my life, have I ever received such poor quality service from any company nor have I ever had a technician that behaved in such a rude and unprofessional manner. Hopefully I will have happier news in the near future but for now...the beat goes on. I got up early this morning and drove to OBX . I went to the management company and got our keys. I then went to our new condo and unloaded my car. I put up the curtain rods, curtains, shower curtains along wi
h a bunch of bathroom towels. It ended up being one of those days...if anything could go wrong...it did. I finally got everything and all of the extras that were packed in the car, got put away. One thing I forgot to bring was some window cleaner and paper towels. I was planning on cleaning up things in the kitchen and bathrooms. Probably a good thing that I forgot the spritz because it took me all day just to get everything else done. Although everything is brand new, this condo has been closed up for a couple of years now, so everything will need a good cleaning. Tomorrow night the computers get torn down so I won't be back online until the 10 th of March...at least that is when Charter is supposed to install cable, telephone and internet . So the next blog entry will be coming from our new place. After not hearing from the Charter Communications rep about my initial assigned telephone number being lost out in limbo land, I decided not to wait around for them to find it. I went ahead and took the new number. I also went ahead and made my way through my long list of businesses to contact and let them know my "new" new telephone number. Monday I will be heading down to OBX early in the morning. I need to stop by and pick up our keys and then head over to the place. I have a vehicle full of stuff to unload and then I need to start putting up curtain rods and curtails. After that I will do some work in the bathrooms...putting up shower curtains and towels. Hopefully I can get it all done during this one trip. On Wednesday the moving crew comes to box everything up and then on Thursday they will be here early to pack the truck. Starting on Wed we won't have any internet nor computers. We won't have any internet until 3/10, at which time Charter will come out to our new place and set us up with telephone, internet and cable service. This upcoming week with be hectic to say the least be at least we are making progress.
Gcalc broke a while back because the html on the Google's search results page changed. Gcalc has been updated and you can download the new binary here. gcalc-0.5 Hi folks. It's been a while since I last posted anything. My family and I moved from the valley to Seattle. We love it up here but we've been very busy. Anyway, on to something somewhat interesting... Question: In C++, what's the difference between the following new Foo; new Foo(); Give up (I almost did)? They're both valid and they both return a pointer to a newly constructed Foo on the heap. They only produce different results when Foo is a POD type . In a nutshell, a POD (Plain Ol' Data) type is a class/struct that only contains data members that are scalar types (int, unsigned char, float, bool, etc.) or other POD types. Basically, a POD object looks like an old C-style struct. For example: (sorry about the lack of indentation—blogger ate it) // POD class Foo { public: int a; }; // NOT a pod class Bar { public: int a; string name; // not a POD type }; The difference between new Foo and new Foo() is that former will be uninitialized and the latter will be default initialized (to zero) when Foo is a POD type. So, when not using the form with the parens, the member "a" can contain garbage, but with the parens "a" will always be initialized to 0. Let's see: $ cat pod.cc #include struct Foo { int a; }; int main() { Foo- foo = new Foo; foo->a = 7; delete foo; Foo- new_foo = new Foo; printf(" new_foo ->a = %d\n", new_foo ->a); delete new_foo; return 0; } $ g++ -o pod pod.cc $ ./pod new_foo->a = 7 But if we simply add empty parens to our new Foo, we'll get different behavior (again, this is only because Foo is a POD type). $ cat pod.cc #include struct Foo { int a; }; int main() { Foo- foo = new Foo () ; foo->a = 7; delete foo; Foo- new_foo = new Foo () ; printf("new_foo->a = %d\n", new_foo->a); delete new_foo; return 0; } $ g++ -o pod pod.cc $ ./pod new_foo->a = 0 And that's about it. The two forms are nearly identical. They behave the same except when used on a POD type, in which case the form with parens initializes the members to zero. Perhaps not that useful, but somewhat interesting. I'm moving soon and I'm trying to get Comcast setup at the new location. I went through their online ordering process, and aside from the fact that there was no useful information given to differentiate one "package" from another, the process wasn't too painful... until the last step. At the end of the process, they require that you chat with a representative online in this shoddy Java applet. I assumed the representative would simply verify some information, then wrap things up. But actually, she said that she needed my SSN. She also reassured me numerous times that "COMCAST is all about protecting customer confidentiality", and that my "information is secured and cannot be viewed by anyone else." Hmm, I thought to myself, I do see that this applet was loaded on a page fetched using https, but how do I know that the applet itself is communicating with the server securely? So, of course I immediately started tcpdumping the session. $ sudo tcpdump -s0 -i en1 -A ... And sure enough, I started seeing unencrypted communication between the applet and the server.

And during the conversation they send your name, address, phone, and SSN through this chat session, and they claim that the information is secured. I would advise everyone to NOT trust online orders with Comcast, especially ones that use the Java applet pictured here. Or perhaps the better advice is to just not trust anything with the word "Comcast" on it (except for this blog post). I don't know why I'm still amazed by their consistent incompetence. Today we announced a new open source project called Update Engine . Update Engine is a framework to help developers keep their software up-to-date. See the Google Mac blog post for a quick overview and a link to some demo movies explaining Update Engine [and yes, I knew I sounded like kermit when I recorded the video—I even told my wife but she didn't think so... oh well ;-)]. Also, we did not build Update Engine to compete with Sparkle . We built Update Engine to solve different problems. If you're interested, here's my reply about this in the Google Group for the project. I updated gcalc to fix an issue caused by Google changing the HTML around the Google calculator answers (they added an extra h2 tag). No biggie, but gcalc now works again. You can get the new version here . Also, I made gcalc a (small) code.google.com project. So you can now check it out at http://code.google.com/p/uj-gcalc/ . The other day I needed to find the location of an application using its bundle ID. Easy, just use LaunchServices. But I needed to do this from a script. Here are a couple perl one-liners to do it. $ perl -MMac::Processes -e 'printf "%s\n", LSFindApplicationForInfo(undef, "com.apple.TextEdit")' /Applications/TextEdit.app $ mv /Applications/TextEdit.app ~/Desktop/ $ perl -MMac::Processes -e 'printf "%s\n", LSFindApplicationForInfo(undef, "com.apple.TextEdit")' /Users/jgm/Desktop/TextEdit.app $ mv ~/Desktop/TextEdit.app /Applications/ $ perl -MMac::Processes -e 'printf "%s\n", LSFindApplicationForInfo(undef, undef, "TextEdit.app")' /Applications/TextEdit.app (Yes, I know mdfind could do something similar. But it wouldn't necessarily return the one that LaunchServices thinks is the "preferred" one if there were multiple applications with the same bundle ID.) There's often confusion about the difference between the following three declarations in Objective-C: id foo1; NSObject -foo2; id&lt;NSObject&gt; foo3; The first one is the most common. It simply declares a pointer to some Objective-C object (see /usr/include/objc/objc.h ). id gives the compiler no information about the actual type of the object, so the compiler cannot do compile-time type checking for you. Thus, the compiler will let you send any (-) message to objects declared id . Actually, this is why the common idiom of [[Foo alloc] init] doesn't cause the compiler to complain. +alloc is declared to return type id , so the compiler won't yell when you then send the returned object the message init (or even initWithMyFoo:blah ). So, objects declared using id are just dynamically typed at runtime. The compiler has no useful information about the object's real type, so it can't warn you if you send it a message that it may not respond to. Just because we know that an id is an Objective-C object does not mean that it points to an object that derives from NSObject, or that it even has common methods like retain and release. One solution is to statically type our variable using NSObject- as shown in number 2 above. This gives the compiler information about the class of the object pointed to by foo2 so the compiler can warn if you send a message to foo2 that an NSObject doesn't respond to. This means you can safely call retain, release, description, etc., but the compiler will warn if you call length or count or anything that an NSObject doesn't respond to. So, declaring a generic pointer of type NSObject- is very similar to what you would do in other languages, like Java, but it's really a bit too restrictive for a language as flexible as Objective-C. Despite what you may have learned at one point, not all Foundation/Cocoa objects derive from NSObject. As an example, NSProxy is not derived from NSObject, so the foo2 pointer above would not be able to hold an NSProxy subclass, even though NSProxy does implement common methods like retain and release. What you really want is a pointer to any object that behaves like an NSObject. And that's exactly what the third case does. Declaring an object as id&lt;NSObject&gt; tells the compiler that you don't care what type the object is, but you do care that it conforms to the specified NSObject protocol--. The compiler will ensure that all objects you assign to that pointer conform to the required protocol. A pointer typed like this can safely hold any NSObject (because NSObject conforms to the NSObject protocol), but it could also hold any NSProxy, because NSProxy also conforms to the NSObject protocol. In english, the declaration id&lt;NSObject&gt; foo3; says "foo3 is a pointer to an object of any type that behaves like an NSObject". This is very powerful, convenient, and expressive. In reality, we often don't care what type an object is, we just care that it responds to the messages that we want to send it (e.g., retain, release). So how do you decide which form you want to use? It's pretty easy. If you don't want (or can't have) any type checking, then use a plain id . This is very common for return types on methods that don't know the type of object they're returning (e.g., +alloc ). It is also common to declare delegates to be type id , because delegates are generally checked at runtime with respondsToSelector: , and they usually aren't retained. However, if you do want compile-time type checking, you must decide between the second and third cases. Well, let me just help you out&mdash;you want the third case! :-) I've very, very, VERY rarely seen a situation where NSObject - worked but id&lt;NSObject&gt; would not. And using the protocol form has the advantage that it will work with NSProxys. You may think that you never use NSProxys, but Cocoa's distributed objects system makes heavy use of NSProxy subclasses. Additionally, the common case is that you simply want to ensure that an object can be retained or released, and in that case the protocol form conveys that intent better; you really don't care what class the object is, you only care that it behaves like an NSObject. - Well, not "any" message. If you send a message using a selector that the compiler has never seen, it may warn that it has never seen that selector. This is nice in the event that you mistype init as inti . -- Now, when I say "NSObject" here I'm talking about the protocol ( @protocol ) named NSObject. There is also a class named NSObject that does indeed conform to the NSObject protocol, but they are two different things. Markd over at the Borkware Miniblog posted some great pictures&mdash;and hilarious captions&mdash;of Macworld '08.
Some of you may know the legend of the long lost film The White Gazelle, made by Tony Laudati in I believe 1981 (?). It was featured in Cinemagic magazine long long ago, but until now the movie itself was unavailable for viewing to anyone who didn't know Tony personally. Well, thanks to today's digital culture, it's now available - for 99 cents no less (!!) on a site called Filmginder. White Gazelle on Filmgrinder This is an amateur production... shot in 16mm, but featuring some incredible sculpting and in-camera compositing effects. The compositing isn't as flawless as it would be if shot on 35mm film with a pin-registered camera... the 16mm models are known to suffer from what's called "film weave", making compositing effects tricky. All that said, as soon as I found out the film was available I went ahead and downloaded it. I was able to pay through my PayPal account, simple as pie, and no problems whatsoever with joining the site or getting the download. I really love the atmosphere of this movie. There's something primal about it... watching this caveman and his woman I get a real sense of how tough life was in paleolithic times, and what's more I get a strong sense of shamanism. Magic and mojo... the basis of all art and performance, leading right up to and including of course stopmotion itself. Needless to say, I highly recommend this... ESPECIALLY for the price!! Yes!!! Life stirs once again in the Darkstudio!!! My winter vacation is over and Im back to work on the film!!! ... And what's more, I'm just about ready to start shooting. Hopefully in a few days. For today's update, I got the bar stools all painted up looking nice and grungy. Hey people... sorry I haven't updated in so long!!! It's been insanely cold around here... hovering around 5 degrees F and ranging up to about 15 for a few weeks now. Too cold in the basement for glue or paint to set right... and for human habitation too!! I haven't been down here for more than about ten minutes at a stretch and even then I wrapped my lower half up in a sleeping bag and wore lots of layers!!! So no work on the set recently, but now the cold front has passed, so work should resume. Actually I already got a few small things done, but nothing worth posting pics yet. See ya soon..... Last night I decided to put the new wall onto the set even though I have more work to do on it... I wanted to see it all together for a preview and mess around with lighting to try to find an approach to use for this film. This link should take you to Photobucket and from there you can download the full size image... it looks SO MUCH better than this little rinky-dink version!! (scroll over the picture to see the download option). This is what the shot was looking like at first. Download this one here. Note the problems with the lighting.... very hard glaring light on the foreheads, and the faces in shadow. This is a result of the way they're sculpted. Note... I am NOT dissing Scott Radke's sculpting!!! I LOVE these heads... but because of the way they're done... eyes set so wide and facing different directions, bare foreheads with no hair covering them that face directly into the light plane, and somewhat glossy paint - it makes them very hard to light. It's a challenge (like everything about this project). And it's forcing me to dig deep and find a different way to work. Here's the solution that's working best so far... These are my lights. I'm only using 2 for this shot, and note... they're both facing FORWARD .... rather than the more normal option of being aimed directly at the set. See the next image to understand WHY . See the big white sheets of paper fastened to the front of the set? They're reflectors. The lights are both aimed at them, and then only reflected light is bounced back onto the set to light the puppets. {for this pic I actually had a light aimed directly at the set just to make things show up better} Reflected light has some very nice properties... it's very diffused, doesn't cast a clear shadow, and it has a lot less glare than direct light does. And because this is all fill light coming from the front, it fills in details like the eye sockets that were in deep shadow before. This kind of reflected lighting seems to be the only solution to the lighting problems posed by these heads. But... if you compare the two shots above, even though the direct lighting causes glare and shadow problems, it has a much more dramatic look to it... creating great shadows that define the form of the heads... the fully reflected light doesn't do this. In fact, reflected light like this is often called cartoon lighting, because of the lack of drama and overall illuminated feel. I want to try to find a halfway solution... I think if I can aim a light or two directly at the set with plenty of neutral density gels (grey color filters) to dim them down while still keeping the reflected lighting I currently have, I should be able to get the best of both worlds. Time will tell. Making yet another brick wall.... why do I torture myself like this? This is the last major set piece, after this it's just a matter of putting it all together, finishing up a few loose ends, and doing final set dressing before launching into actual animation. Hard to believe... after 3 long years, this film is actually going to happen!! It took a lot of work to turn a pice of foamcore into a brick wall... here it was at one point: So much cutting and the hardest part was peeling off both paper facings from each brick individually (too hard to peel a large piece). But it's done now, aside from a little more painting and detailing. Soon I'll show some of the props I've been making. I've made several brick walls before... Buster's hat tip test , Race the Wind , and my first, for the Ahab tests . when I look at that bucket of peeled bricks just above I clearly remember the History Channel show about Einstein that was on as I laboriously peeled each one. And for Race the Wind... it was a Victoria's secret Runway Show (that one was a bit distracting). I don't recall the other ones, but it's funny how certain kinds of work lend themselves to that kind of memory retention... possibly it's the tedious repetitive jobs that allow us to pay attention to something else as we work. Here's a motion test I shot some time ago... actually it was before I had the Lumix camera, done with my Hitachi. I think I used a big zoom lens, which probably accounts for why out-of-focus things look so weird here. I was trying to develop a certain kind of motion that I could see in my head for this film... the characters and the camera all moving in unison like an orchestrated dance. Oh and yeah, I know... he has some kind of neck spasm there. Rotational movement is hard to keep under control... so I learned something valuable from this test! I've learned how to use a framegrabber a lot better since then, though I really haven't tried another head turn like this - something I ought to do soon. This is amazing!! Just posted on the message board, and in production for some time already over at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Germany... stopmotion puppets placed in a CG environment that was created (and framegrabbing done) using Blender open source 3D software. I must say, this definitely looks like one of the coolest films I've seen being made recently... for a long time actually. I wish I had come up with this idea!!! Check out their blog: http://www.artificial3d.com/omega/ IN a pair of recent posts - Analyze this and the followup Analysister -I brought up the idea of some aspects of a movie (surface story) being readily discernible to the left (logical) brain and some, more subtle parts, to the right (intuitive) brain. I had never thought about this until making the Analyze this post and discussing the way Kubrick's films seem to work on a viewer. For convenience's sake I've included a table below listing the well-known attributes of these two hemispheres of the brain. Right Brain vs. Left Brain Definition This theory of the structure and functions of the mind suggests that the two different sides of the brain control two different “modes” of thinking. It also suggests that each of us prefers one mode over the other. Discussion Experimentation has shown that the two different sides, or hemispheres, of the brain are responsible for different manners of thinking. The following table illustrates the differences between left-brain and right-brain thinking: Left Brain Right Brain Logical Sequential Rational Analytical Objective Looks at parts Random Intuitive Holistic Synthesizing Subjective Looks at wholes Article It suddenly occurred to me that this division between two different ways of thinking sounds very familiar... in fact I've encountered very nearly the same division between ways of thinking - one logical and focused, the other intuitive and 'fuzzy', but in a non-scientific context: The Apollonian/ Dionysian dichotomy Apollonian and Dionysian are terms used by Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy to designate the two central principles in Greek culture. The Apollonian, which corresponds to Schopenhauer's principium individuationis ("principle of individuation"), is the basis of all analytic distinctions. Everything that is part of the unique individuality of man or thing is Apollonian in character; all types of form or structure are Apollonian, since form serves to define or individualize that which is formed; thus, sculpture is the most Apollonian of the arts, since it relies entirely on form for its effect. Rational thought is also Apollonian since it is structured and makes distinctions. The Dionysian, which corresponds roughly to Schopenhauer's conception of Will, is directly opposed to the Apollonian. Drunkenness and madness are Dionysian because they break down a man's individual character; all forms of enthusiasm and ecstasy are Dionysian, for in such states man gives up his individuality and submerges himself in a greater whole: music is the most Dionysian of the arts, since it appeals directly to man's instinctive, chaotic emotions and not to his formally reasoning mind. Nietzsche believed that both forces were present in Greek tragedy, and that the true tragedy could only be produced by the tension between them. He used the names Apollonian and Dionysian for the two forces because Apollo, as the sun-god, represents light, clarity, and form, whereas Dionysus, as the wine-god, represents drunkenness and ecstasy. Article I discussed this in an old post on my original blog: http://www.darkstrider.net/july8_2005.html Sorry, I can't link directly to it... I used to hand-code that blog and didn't know how to separate posts, so I can only link to the entire page, but it's the second post. Just scroll down a little bit. I was profoundly taken by this idea when I first encountered it in Camille Paglia's book Sexual Personae, and she really made me aware of these two different modes of perception/cognition. These little tables I posted here and similar ones you see on the web are very brief and only cover the basics, but Paglia dissects it quite deeply. She also relates these modes of thinking to what she terms the Male principle and the Female principle... left brain/ Apollonian being the male and right brain/ Dionysian being the female. Don't oversimplify and think she's making a general division between men and women... people have some of each tendency in their makeup, just as we all use both left and right brain. Many women exhibit strong male tendencies while many men have female tendencies. Well, when I connected these various ideas together, it became clear to me that they are very real tendencies that exist in all of us. Modern sbrain science, as it often does, is merely re-inforcing ancient wisdom. The Greeks were aware of this dichotomy centuries ago, and now it's been discovered in the very structure of the brain itself... so science has only shown us figuratively where Apollo and Dionysus live. It makes me wonder... how many of the other Olympian gods could be said to embody some part of human nature... god of war... goddess of the hunt, goddess of love.... interesting. And doubtless not new! Only something that hadn't occurred to me before. So.... taking all this into account... the idea of a dichotomy in modes of thinking that's existed in human nature for a long time and that it's cropped up in various ways, both scientific and mythical/artistic, I began to wonder if it's reared its head in any other ways. And sure enough, a couple similar dichotomies presented themselves to my questing mind. Dichotomy in politics Exploring the neurobiology of politics, scientists have found that liberals tolerate ambiguity and conflict better than conservatives because of how their brains work. In a simple experiment reported today in the journal Nature Neuroscience, scientists at New York University and UCLA show that political orientation is related to differences in how the brain processes information. Previous psychological studies have found that conservatives tend to be more structured and persistent in their judgments whereas liberals are more open to new experiences. The latest study found those traits are not confined to political situations but also influence everyday decisions. This is just a section of an article posted here . To condense these tendencies down to their most basic (for purposes of simplicity) we could call one Focused and the other Vague or Fuzzy. Which then led me to my next (and so far last) revelation... Rods and Cones Article Two different kinds of 'photoreceptors', or neurons, in the eye. Rods are responsible for night vision and peripheral vision... they're not as 'focused' as the cones, which see detail and color. Therefore the vision of the rods could be characterized as 'fuzzy' or vague, but in some way superior to the rod-vision. Have you ever noticed that , if you're looking up into the night sky, very dim stars or very distant galaxies (which at first look like dim stars) can't be seen by looking directly at them (cones) but only by looking a little bit away, activating the rods. To me all these various dichotomies sound very similar. In fact I'd venture to say taken as a whole they point out the same basic division in the human being... a divergence between different modes of... is it perception, cognition, or interpretation? Hard to say. And I won't make any statements here, aside from bringing up what I think is a very interesting conundrum revealing itself to us in various ways - Mythical (a way of giving meaning to things we don't understand) Scientific (a way of studying nature) and Political -- and that might have a profound meaning as far as what it means to be human. ... And with this post, hopefully I conclude this little obsession that began just before Halloween when I happened to catch The Shining on cable TV (little realizing the bizarre series of ideas it would lead me through!) and can now get back to work on my film!!
Absolutely stunning digital rendering: [ Wow, that is really stunning work, and very creative. ] A quote from the author Staszek Marek: The most beautiful places that come to mind always have water, steep cliffs and tropics in common. Lush turquoise colors emphasizing positive vibes, something I've never seen. I wanted to achieve complete integration of future architecture with nature, complete with green parks, trees and gardens. What caught my eye and train of thought right away was his remarks about how big an influence the landscape is, in relationship to the architecture. Renderings like this . . . the creativity needs to be shared. There are a number of other entries here , be prepared to be amazed. Powered by ScribeFire . Great story in the NYTimes about Laura Spector who goes out into the woods alone and cuts down all the vine(s) she can pull out to make something great out of something very bad. [From the Laura Spector website .] Apparently she targets Bitttersweet or Asiatic vine Celastrus orbiculata which has run amok in her part of the "woods". Her specialty, apparently a little of everything-sconces, mirrors, arches, furniture, etc. Good for her! From the story: “I go out into the woods alone, everywhere,” she said. “And I go deep, a mile or two in from roads. The hardest part is schlepping the stuff out alone. I have letters of permission from places like the Aspetuck Land Trust and Aquarion, the water company. They’re happy to lead me to the worst infestations, as long as I indemnify them in case I fall.” Here's another great piece from Laura's website ; which I am linking you to, the NYTimes does not. [ One of Laura's benches , I love that Koa wood slab.] Great stuff, really great imagination. In her own words: My work is unique in that it is influenced by the rich and decorative18th Century British Romantic tradition. British rustic is unique from its more familiar American cousin, in that its graceful lines follow nature’s whimsy yet suggest the complexity of wrought ironwork. Finally this piece of railing: [Very nice, keep up the good work Laura. ] Powered by ScribeFire . I noticed that folks are still stopping by looking for info on Pergola's and such. Be advised that I have indeed been at this new site for quite awhile. Still discussing pergola's renderings, landscape construction, drawings, waterfeatures, ponds, landscape construction, etc. Even though I enjoyed my time here and appreciated the recognition of the Blogger staff I moved over to Wordpress .com. It was not an easy decision because I had to hand export over 250 post, and find a way to move comments also. It was the opportunity to have several pages to add additional info . . . which also allowed me to clean up the front page of my Blog. I don't know if I'm a minimalist at heart, but my inner designer likes clean and simple. So here I am gone . . . to Wordpress. Here again, is the new site . If you were kind enough to set up a link to this page from your Blog or page I would appreciate it if you would change that to my new Blog site over at Wordpress. I appreciate the fact the you thought enough of what I am doing to link to my page and I hope that will continue over at my new site. Again, thanks a lot in advance. I look forward to your readership, comments, and feedback. Landscape Design, and Design is important to our lives, and good design makes our life more enjoyable, more pleasant, and more civilized. I will continue to write about what I see, hear, learn, and ponder about as I continue my life's work. My friends . . . . have all chimed in, one way or another, and have decided they like the Wordpress look better. So I will respect their opinions and move. The only real question left for me is do I stay at Wordpress.com or do I move entirely over to another type of site. As in a paying site. Where I can have the blog hosted, and at the same time move the WCI website to also. There are (for me) plus'es and minus'es to both sides of this equation. All of this is going to have to wait until I get back from the Mgmt. Clinic in Louisville, KY. this coming week. I trip I am looking forward to-this is a very good conference, lots of high energy. So for now dear readers keep catching me over at the other site where I am posting like mad, like mad I tell you . . . yes actually mad. I wonder . . . how do you spell plus'es and minus'es? Well I have almost everything moved over to the Wordpress site . I am almost certain I am moving over there. The swag, chiclets(sp?), and buttons are not over there and I am not sure how that is going to work out. I really do not want to add anymore to the sidebar. If needed I will add those to another page. I have added everyone's link in the link page and think it looks good, and those links look easy to find. The page loads faster over there, and I like the cleaner look-hey! I'm a Designer! I Design, I like clean simple lines. Just look at my work. Now I know graphic design is entirely different than Landscape Design, but aesthetics are aesthetics . . . aren't they? Take a look , but I am pretty sure this is a done deal, unless a flood of folks say different. The biggest reason not to leave is that Google loves me, it really loves me. I hope it happens at the Wordpress site. We shall see. I have moved my Blog to a Word Press site. To see, just how it would look in a different type of setting. To streamline, to pull back on sidebar stuff. So I am looking for some feedback, via e-mail or comment. Which style of blog seems to fit what I am trying to do?
The Weds night hang is in flux. Tomorrow is St Patty's, so we'll be steering clear of bars. Plan tomorrow: 5:45 pm: meet at Polly Judd. 6 pm: Ride We'll ride the middle trail south to miserable climb to Bernard/Highdrive, then drop back down on the top trail to Polly Judd to land at Huck's by 7pm. This is all swoopy single track with some climbing. The single track is easy, but the bluff drop off can be distracting to newbies. If you're not into the ride part, then feel free and clear to meet at Huck's. Remember: this is about hanging out and -talking- about bikes. This whole riding thing is new to the Hang, so all bike-talkers are always welcome. Picture this: A rad dude on a "vintage" Bridgestone MB-2. The MB-2 has been hacked into a single-speed. There's no unsightly chain tensioner. Tight. The rad dude is track standing in the front of a long line of traffic at a busy intersection waiting for a red light to turn. He's listening to 20 year-old rad punk music in his mp3 player. It's a sunny day and life is good. And rad. He's aloof but ready to hammer off the line. The light turns green and he lays into his pedals with all of the fury of his middle-aged strength. Bad Religion drowns out the POP! his chain makes as it snaps. His elegant chain line was the result of hours of filing, grinding, and chain-length fussing -- indeed, he had to add and remove his half-chain-link a number of times as he tried different combinations of freewheel and chainring. In the split second he slams his members into the top tube of his vintage steel, he ponders the hackneyed phrase, "you're only as strong as your weakest link." The phrase, as it turns out, does make some sense. Cars move around him, perplexed drivers staring. Another cyclists rides by and says something the rad dude can't hear. Was it, "that didn't look good..."? By now the top-tube has made clear it's immovable, cold, steel resolve upon the rad dude's groin. Tears well up in the rad dude's eyes as he picks up the chain and limps his bike to the side walk, where he will call for a ride home for the second time. With apologies to Lynyrd Skynyrd--if you're not familiar with the song you can check it out here --I offer up this for every cyclist riding in traffic. Gimme Three Feet I was riding along, My head stuck on this song, Right wheel tracking in my lane. When the cars in the mirror Brought on my greatest of fears. They think passin' bikes is a game. They would brush by close As if they wanted to boast Of making three lanes from two. Now I don't like to fight But this just isn't right And I'm lookin' out for you know who. Oh, won't you gimme three feet, Gimme three feet, drivers. Gimme three feet and go around. Gimme three feet. Gimme three feet, drivers, And we make it home safe and sound. I know that I'm slow, But we're sharing the road So please don't make me squirm. Go ahead and zoom After you give me some room And I'll go back to hearing this earworm . Hey, there fellow With the truck painted yellow, I pay my taxes, too. I know that you'd be swayed If you and I would trade And this cyclist now was you. So gimme three feet, Gimme three feet, drivers. Gimme three feet and go around. Gimme three feet. Gimme three feet, drivers, And we make it home safe and sound. I can already hear it playing. Can't you? Score. I see lots of tools on the side of the road when I ride. I've stopped picking up channel lock pliers. As we rode down Broadway this morning I saw this wrench in a flash as we passed. It took me another 10 feet or so to process what I'd seen. All I knew is that whatever the wrench was, it was metric. Hells yeah. A 8 mm/10 mm combo wrench. How perfect is that? I never find such obvious bikey tools like this. I was thinking it was about the best road find one could hope for. But the obvious holy grail of all bike finds would be the Hozan Rock Ring Wrench. I hacked this out of Nate's private fancy invite-only blog. From our ride on Friday.... This is a great ride. I think the last time I rode this was with Jason . Sorry about the formatting. -------------- East Temple Road. Today's half-century-plus took John, Friday Ride newcomer Andrew, Tom and I to a place where winter actually visited, and still lingers. I had a heavy sack of rain and warmth gear on my back, but the promised rain never came, except in spits. It was much warmer than yesterday. We did however meet with lots of wind and plenty of mud. We started at the Scoop for coffee. John was eager to get going. We made our descent on Bernard, and headed out Centenial Trail. We climbed deadly Lehman Hill and made our way to Temple. The climb up Temple is double-deadly, but the views are great... ...in all directions. The guys waited for me to catch up on the hills. At the top of the hill, the eastside gravel road turns to dirt. There was snow, mud, lots of water flowing. The temp dropped in shaded, protected parts of the road, though there was little ice. I walked some of the slipperiest sections, but still managed to fall off the bike once in some snow. (The others rode the whole of it.) But the descent was a blast, and the woods a beautiful place to be. We stopped for some gas station food by Newman Lake, and I took a look at my shoes under the table. Heh! The ride home back on CT was up tempo, into the wind. That section of the CT is pretty on the river side, but bleak on the other. I was getting tired. Tom and I high-fived when my odometer hit 50, then again when his turned 50 a mile later. By the time I got home I was at 57.1, my longest single ride of the year so far. Click for big. Before I begin any postings about where or what I ride, I'd like to introduce myself. Some of you may know me. In fact, "I" seem to be everywhere. You see, I may very well be you. Or you may be me. I'm (we're) the person that loves to bike. Yet, it's often too cold, wet or far. We're in a hurry or there's a meeting we need to look nice for. Or -insert reason not to ride here-. When we do get on the bike we realize how much we like it. How much freedom it provides and how good it makes us feel. But the neighbors dog scares me. I'll ride tomorrow. So here's the deal. Beginning tomorrow, Saturday March 13th I will ride every day for 42 days. It may be a long ride, more likely it'll be a short one. No excuses. Gotta work a 24-hour shift at the Fire Department? Too bad! Ride to work in the morning and home the next day. Heck, that's two days right there. Each day will be blogged about on my personal site (which is even more stale than my bike riding). Send me a personal e-mail at ffemtjacque at gmail dot com if you need the address. The really cool rides I'll post here with pictures. In an effort to keep this post short that's all I really have to say. I'm me and very well may be you. Let's stop making excuses and ride. Till later, Who Loves Ya? Oh, this is why 42 days. --Edit-- Does anyone have a mileage computer I can borrow for this? I'd like to track my daily mileage. I'll return it after the 42-days. --Edit #2-- Thanks for all the responses and support. I've got a computer to track miles and look forward to some rides with ya'll. This just in. Shimano has gone back to their original 2-strap sandal style for the 2010 version. Hallelujah. I've carried on endlessly about the demise of the 2-strap Shimano sandals on this blog. And then there's the Keen Commuter woes . Everytime I talk sandals, I fear the wrath of BSNYC, or his/her followers, but I am proud to speak for the wool-sock-with-sandal-wearing nerds of Fredom. Thank you Shimano for making your sandal look and act more like a sandal again. Now if we can just get Ibex to bring back the Hybrid ...
Merry Christmas, Everyone! I sure hope you had a great Christmas. I know I did. Each year it seems to get better and better. I was very pleased with how well our Christmas Eve Operation went last night given all of the unexpected challenges. We ended up with 100% delivery success and initial polls show that overall satisfaction was around 97%. That's up about 4% from last year (note: last year was actually the lowest we have had since the 1940s) and back within our historically normal range. It was a very pleasant Christmas for me. It took us about 3 hours after I landed back at the North Pole to wind down the operations. Mrs. Claus and I then had brunch together at the house. Some of the elves were kind enough to prepare it for us so that neither one of us had to cook... it was very nice of them. After brunch, Mrs. Claus and I both took a 4 hour nap. We awoke around 2pm NPT but only because I had set the alarm. Its a good thing I did because we had to get up and prepare Christmas dinner. We invited about a dozen of our closest friends over for dinner. It's nothing fancy but its one of my favorite things about the season.... we (read: Mrs. Claus) make good food, its a great atmosphere, and we share laughs with good friends. We just use the dining room but on Christmas, with the dining room tree (it's a 10-footer, decorated with multi-color lights and hand-made ornaments we have received as gifts from children all over the world... every country is represented) glowing, tens of candles flickering, and the floor-to-ceiling windows revealing the snowy scene outside, and a huge fire roaring in the stone fireplace, the atmosphere was hard to beat. We sat for hours after dinner drinking coffee, sharing memories, and making plans for the future. I hope all of you had a chance to connect with friends and family the way Mrs. Claus and I were able to tonight. After everyone left and Mrs. Claus went to bed, I retired to the den and took a seat in my recliner. I turned all the lights off except the Christmas tree lights and the lights in the garland that draped all the windows. The fire was burning low in the fireplace and about a dozen candles on the mantle were lit. I started to turn the TV on but then decided not to... instead I turned on the sound system and tuned the satellite radio to the Christmas music channel. I grabbed one last cup of Christmas Blend coffee (I won't drink anymore until next year) and settled in my recliner. I just sat there and enjoyed the moment... soaking in every last precious moment of Christmas. I didn't think about old memories or make plans for the future... I was just truly in the moment. I don't know about you but its rare I do that. I am always thinking about what's next... two, three, four moves down the road. I don't think much about the past other than to consider what I can learn from it but thinking about "what's next" often keeps me out of the moment. So tonight was special. It is something I need to apply more often. If you haven't taken time to just sit and enjoy a quiet, still moment during this very special... even magical... time of year, I encourage you to do so. You will be amazed at the pure joy it provides. It's time now for me to "hit the hay". It's been an amazing run to and through Christmas this year. As we close this season, I want you to know how much I appreciate all of you. I hope that my role as Santa Claus serves to provide you with joy, hope, and belief. I pray the spirit of Christmas and its true meaning will be with you through out the year ahead. May God bless you and all of your loved ones. Merry Christmas to all and to all a very blessed night! Love, Santa ...and to all a Good Night! The last presents have been delivered, the last cookie eaten, the last glass of milk consumed, and the last stocking filled. I just recieved the "All Clear" signal from the North Pole Headquarters. We are pointing the sleigh due north and returning home. I hope everyone has had as much fun this Christmas Eve as I have had tonight. Tomorrow is going to be the best Christmas yet! I will not update my log until late in the day to day as I plan on enjoying Christmas brunch with Mrs. Claus and taking a nap. Good night, all! "And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name JESUS: for He shall save His people from their sins." - Matthew 1:21 I am just entering Alaska. It feels like being back home at the North Pole. Talk about cold! Brrr. I am still behind schedule but we will easily finish our work this evening before the sunrises and kids wake up. It's been a good night... even with a few unexpected challenges along the way. From here, I will head south to the Hawaiian Islands. I'll make a few stops between but I can shed the jacket for a few minutes and swap out my Starbucks Christmas blend coffee for some 100% Kona coffee while I'm cruising through the Islands. I love it down there! Mrs. Claus and I will be back in the Islands for our annual vacation in a little more than a week. Can't wait! To all of you now awake across Europe, Asia, Africa, &amp; Australia/Oceania... Merry Christmas! I am still tracking behind schedule but the weather is much, much better. I am currently in the Damascus, Oregon area after spending some time in western Canada. Once again this year, I spent a little extra time in Vancouver, BC with a little girl I know that is fighting cancer as well. I'll spend time with her sister as well. Regrettably, I can't let them see me... but I am so proud of both of them that I want to take a little time and make sure they are tucked in and sleeping well. It was a tough year for both of them as there were additional follow-up surgeries. Life seems to be a roller coaster when you are battling something like this. All I can say is that I really admire the entire family for how they handle this along with all the other challenges life brings us. It is not easy but they are doing it. Day to day they are making life go on. As I said last year, I never cease to be amazed by the strength and character of children that face cancer. They are wise &amp; strong beyond their years. And they are truly an inspiration to me. Its well worth spending a few extra minutes with them. I have deliveries to make so I'm going to sign-off for now. I'll post again soon. I am behind schedule and experiencing some technical difficulties as I move towards the west coast. I have crossed the Rocky Mountain range in North America and am experiencing much better weather conditions; however, due to the storm across the mid-western United States, I am about an hour behind where I would like to be. The weather in the midwestern United States is very challenging right now. We are approximately 30 minutes behind schedule already. The reindeer are having to work very hard as we press against gusting headwinds. Its been very difficult to control the sleigh. I am carrying a fraction of the normal payload or otherwise I don't believe we could keep this thing in the air. On the ground, due to the sheets of ice, we are having to land in front yards and on neighborhood roads and have me hike (with a pair of crampons on my boots) up to and into the houses. The winds are almost blowing me sideways and snow is falling at the rate of about half a foot an hour where I am at currently. We'll be headed back for yet another replenishment stop here in a minute. With the lighter load maximums, we are having to stop many more times than normal. The reindeer are looking forward to the break though as they are working hard! Ok kids... I might be a bit behind schedule and I might have a few challenges, but I am - without question - coming to town. So get to bed!! Oh.. one last note... given the weather, my posts may be a bit delayed and not just because of technology issues but also because I am going to be largely pre-occupied with navigating this storm, surviving the night, and finishing my deliveries. Don't worry if there is a bit of delay... I am ok. No... not THAT one. Elvis. I am currently looking down at the blue lights of Graceland. What a beautiful sight! But I can't look too long... we have to clear this airspace quickly. And that is going to be challening given the current weather conditions. This has already been a very difficult night. I anticipate it only growing more challenging as I head into the heart of the storm. Our friends at FedEx are holding their routes so that we can deliver our presents across the Memphis metro area. I'll be zig-zagging across from Lakeland, TN to Hernando, MS over the next hour or so. I need to stay on time so that I can clear the airspace and let our partners at FedEx (we do a lot of business with them... they help with distribution from our North Pole, China, &amp; India production facilities to our replenishment centers) get back in the air. We definitely don't want them missing their deliveries! So kids... if you live in the mid-South of the United States, its time to get to bed! The weather is nice here in Miami. Unfortunately I can't stay very long. I will be headed west and into the storm pretty soon. As you know, I am constantly getting updates from the North Pole Headquarters. I regret to tell you that once again this year, almost a 100 addresses have been removed from my list of places to stop. The Naughty &amp; Nice list is changing even as we speak. Kids - please make sure you are behaving your parents tonight. You don't want your address to be removed from my list! I'll post again soon.
I have been trying to find the full text of Toyota's apology for the safety problem that has finally resulted in a massive recall of their vehicles for repair of their accelerators.&nbsp; Sadly, I fear the full text&nbsp; consists of this: “I offer my apologies for the worries,“ [Akio Toyoda] said. “Many customers are wondering whether their cars are OK.“&nbsp; This is shockingly inadequate, as so may apologies these days are.&nbsp; This lays the problem entirely on&nbsp; the consumer -- consumer worries and wondering whether their cars are OK, not on Toyota's manufacturing defective cars and its failure to respond immediately to the problem once it was brought to their attention. This is like the ubiquitous, "If I have offended you by [my saying that you are a fat cow], I am sorry."&nbsp; This sort of aplogy does not apologize for calling the person a fat cow but for offending him or her, which is entirely different and is consistent with the idea that the listener's being offended is his or her problem, not the speaker's problem.&nbsp; Mr. Toyoda could have said, "I am sorry that we made defective cars and put your lives in jeopardy," but he didn't.&nbsp; What is worse, we have here a classic example of "too little; too late."&nbsp; State Farm reported the problem to the NHTSA in 2007.&nbsp; Even more disturbing is the fact that NHTSA was getting complaints about acceleration problems in Toyotas in 2003. I have to believe Toyota was the first to know about it but chose to put its head in the sand.&nbsp; The recall is going to cost $900 million by one estimate.&nbsp; And they are losing something like $1.55 million per week in sales.&nbsp; No wonder putting their heads in the sand seemed attractive. I own a 12-13 year old Toyota pick up that has served me well.&nbsp; And my wife has a Rav4.&nbsp; She is a little concerned that she will have accelerator problems.&nbsp; Her fears are due entirely to the fact that Toyota has been totally unforthcoming about exactly what cars, made when are vulnerable to the problem. My wife and I just finished watching Alan Alda's PBS thing on the "human spark."&nbsp; He's a smart guy and funny but what was he thinking when he endorsed the notion that there is a "human spark?"&nbsp; And what were these Harvard and Oxford and other scientists thinking? I have had some experience with media sorts and they are very fond of "hooks" that one can use to snag an audience and keep it.&nbsp; The hook this time is the notion of a "human spark" -- something we have but that chimps and no other species (on this planet) have.&nbsp; This is a terrible metaphor.&nbsp; We know that it takes a spark to ignite gasoline fumes in an automobile cylinder and that this is the most proximate cause of the piston's moving downward thereby assisting the engine in its effort to ...&nbsp; I don't want to get into automobile stuff.&nbsp; I would be way out of my depth.&nbsp; However, I am inclined to think that the evolution of those human qualities that distinguish us from chimps and other life forms might be just a bit more complicated than this metaphor makes it out to be. The terrible thing about this metaphor is that it works better for "sophisticated" intelligent design people than for Darwinists.&nbsp; If intelligent design people are willing to concede that we and the chimps have a common origin, they need only then say, "Aha, Alda is with us.&nbsp; We are the life forms god sparked into humanhood by causing us to be capable of forming complex intentions, recognizing complex intentions in others, and imagining future actions."&nbsp; Unsophisticated intelligent design people need only say that God dropped us on the planet pre-sparked. The show actually admitted that chimps are capable of forming intentions and recognizing intentions in others (but not as well as we do).&nbsp; About the future, they don't seem to think too much but to suppose they can't think about the immediate future is absurd.&nbsp; Indeed the show proved otherwise as when it was argued that alpha males may choose to share with females based on attempting to curry favor with them.&nbsp; Back in the day when I followed research on chimp linguistic development, I formed the view that the researchers who did this work were not always the sharpest academic tacks.&nbsp; In my view, they tended to be so empathetic with their research subjects that they were willing to think things that just might not be true. In the show, the human spark seemed to be whatever "sparked" the conjoint abilities to "read other's minds and travel in time," as Alda put it.&nbsp; Let me show you a picture they showed of the areas of the brain that light up when these two abilities are activated.&nbsp; Notice that these two parts of the brain are not adjacent.&nbsp; Two questions arise in my mind: how did a single spark ignite abilities requiring two different parts of the brain to be be realized and how is it that so much of one part of the brain manage to be recruited for this realization. Perhaps I am being a bit too simplistic here but I am not at all sure that these two abilities are so different.&nbsp; If a crucial feature of humans, one shared by chimps, is our socialization then thinking about the future -- making plans for the future -- must crucially have involved making plans in connection with others.&nbsp; And making plans in connection with others would seem to require an ability to form views as to others' intentions.&nbsp; A Harvard professor did note that both abilities involve escaping one's present point of view.&nbsp; I can imagine that being able to escape one's present point of view could have been a precursor to the gradual evolving of these abilities over a very long time. Spoiler Alert -- Do not read if you haven't seen but plan to see Avatar. I was directed by a tweet to an story in the Japan Times on line saying that a small but vocal minority of people believe that Avatar is racist. First, the phrase "small but vocal" wants to be looked at. What it may mean is that there are two or three people who are extremely talkative who believe this. This article begins Near the end of the hit film "Avatar," the villain snarls at the hero, Both men are white — although the hero is inhabiting a blue-skinned, 2.75-meter-tall, long-tailed alien. "How does it feel to betray your own race?" This is funny. &nbsp;The avatar is no longer an avatar whose brain is being controlled by a white man lying in a device that facilitates this control, but is instead a Na’vi man if someone in a manufactured Na’vi body whose human brain has been transferred into this body can be said to be a Na’vi person. The&nbsp;insulter&nbsp;should have said, "How does it feel to betray your former race?" One idiot promoting this thesis says "The ethnic Na'vi," he writes, "need the White man to save them because, as a less developed race, they lack the intelligence and fortitude to overcome their adversaries by themselves." This is so inaccurate I have to believe the author did not see the movie or is incapable of seeing what is in front of his face. The Na'vi defeated the white devils thanks to Jake's knowledge of the white devil's military hardware and tactics and the intelligence and fortitude of the Na'vi and the assistance of other inhabitants of Pandora.&nbsp;Far from lacking fortitude, the Na'vi threw themselves into battle without regard for their personal safety. Jake's&nbsp;growing understanding of the Pandoran ecosystem played a critical role as well in that he (quite literally) plugged into the ecosystem seeking it to intercede on behalf of the planet. Had he not become an authentic Na'vi in spirit, that intercession would not have worked. James Cameron set himself up for this criticism by using a white actor to play Jake and a person of color to play the Na'vi princess he fell in love with. Had he simply used an African American or English speaking African our critics would be in a hell of a position. It would no longer be a white man saving the blue-colored people but a person of color saving a person of a different color, but it would still be a human rescuing the people of Avatar. So, at the worst, Cameron's mistake was he cast a White man in the role of Jake. &nbsp;Casting a white man made economic sense, I suppose, but it isn't just white people who save others in movies. &nbsp;Will Smith saved the planet in one movie and I understand that Denzel Washington saves the planet in a new&nbsp;movie&nbsp;I haven't yet seen. I am so tired of people playing the "race card" I want to vomit all over this blog. I got into the civil rights movement back in 1960 when it was a serious business because African Americans were denied most basic human rights in the South, including Texas and Oklahoma, as well as other places. The change over these 50 years has been stunning. And guess what? A lot of white people worked alongside African Americans to make the civil rights revolution happen. The lesson from that time is that when there is injustice everyone is obligated to do his or her part. That is the lesson of Pandora. The three white people who controlled the Avatars as spies all "got religion" and did what they could to help the Na'vi defeat the occupying army. &nbsp;It is a good thing when people of any color assist people of any color. &nbsp;The Haitian relief effort is a prime case. &nbsp;Is that relief effort racist because white people are helping persons of color? When I first saw a TV advertisement for the myTouch telephone, I thought instantly of the iTouch, which as I understand it, is an iPhone without the phone app (I have never held either in my hands and have only seen the former in anyone else's.)&nbsp; And having spent a few years working occasionally on the linguistic side of&nbsp; trademark law, I wondered if Apple did not have a case for trademark infringement.&nbsp; One of the tests is that the new mark evoke the notion that the product it identifies might have the same origin as the product identified by the earlier mark.&nbsp;If surveys were to demonstrate that a significant proportion of consumers share my perception, Apple would be a major step forward toward proving its case. A case for infringement would have to consider the similarity of the marks. They are, of course, very similar. We have in the case of “iTouch,” a lower case “i” followed by the word “Touch,” and in the case of “myTouch,” we have a lower case “my” followed by the same word. The letter “i” when capitalized and only when capitalized refers to the person speaking or writing something. Here, though, it is not capitalized. In the case of “my” we have a word that refers to the speaker/writer of something or, in the case, of “myTouch,” the owner/user. One thing is clear, the “i” of “iMac” or“iPod” or “iTunes” or or “iPhone” is normally not intepreted as referring to the owner/user. In fact, when the iMac was first introduced, Steve Jobs claimed (see the title link) The iMac comes from the marriage of the excitement of the internet with the simplicity of Macintosh. He went on to say that it was designed with the fact that the primary use people wanted a personal computer for was to get onto the internet. Jobs cited a set of "i"-words that he wanted to associate with the iMac, namely "internet, individual, instruct, inform, inspire." Therefore, the voice of he creator provides compelling evidence that there is no semantic connection between the “i” of “iTouch” and the “my” of “myTouch.”&nbsp; When he associates the iMac with these other "i"-words, he severs the relationship between "i" and the owner/user more completely even though one of these words is "individual."&nbsp; Note&nbsp; that this word is not equivalent in meaning to "personal."&nbsp; In fact, the iMac was and is used in environments in which many individuals use a particular machine. The fact that the lower case prefix”i” is attached to a wide range of products distributed by Apple argues for it having only the meaning “a product distributed by Apple.” Originally, this “i” primarily referred to the internet though Jobs added some other associations. But the iPod breaks this connection. Apple crated iTunes in the hope that people would buy music using iTunes and then downloading it onto their iPods. That would involve internet connectivity. However, one could use an iPod without ever connecting it to a a program that connected to the internet by simply ripping one's own or a friend's music and converting it to a format the iPod could read and downloading it directly. It is clear that there is a significant morphological similarity between “iTouch” and “myTouch” for they share a morpheme. However, the first has a prefix that refers to the internet primarily but also to other things or just signifies that the product is made by Apple, and the other has a prefix that refers to the owner/user. In addition to the morphological similarity between "iTouch" and "myTouch," thre is an enormous overlap in product function.&nbsp; In fact the only substantive difference is that the iTouch cannot be used to make calls. So, Apple would find it difficult to keep HTC and T-Moble from using the mark “myTouch.” Nevertheless, as I said, I suspect a survey of consumers aware of the&nbsp; iTouch, confronted with this new product,&nbsp; would connect “myTouch” to “iTouch” and thereby to Apple. At the very least, HTC would seem to be ripping off some of Apple's market good will. I am not a trademark lawyer but I think that is a 'no no.” This evening, I caught the tail end of a Zale's commercial exclaiming,, "The more you spend the more you save."&nbsp; Contrast that with, "A penny saved is a penny earned."&nbsp; Neither actually makes any sense except for the fact that if you do save a penny on day 1, then on day 2, it is as if you earned a penny on day 1 though of course you didn't.&nbsp; The Zale's ad is even stupider, which is troubling for it presumes (as is true for many people I fear) that people will be so seduced by the combination of the gratifying concept of spending -- don't we all love to spend? -- and the comforting concept of saving to rush to Zale's&nbsp; to buy diamonds.&nbsp; However, trust me, if you go by Ben Franklin's adage on day 1 you will have more money on day 2 than if you abide by Zale's. At the Zale's web site linked to the title of this blog, you get a bit different version of this promotional scheme, namely "the more you buy the more you save."&nbsp; Notice that these two claims are linguistically different.&nbsp; We spend money to buy things.&nbsp; However, what the web site offers is savings in proportion to how much you spend, not how many things you buy.&nbsp; According to Zale's, if you spend $250-$449, you save $25 dollars.&nbsp; Clearly the smart shopper would spend just $250 and get thereby a 10% reduction.&nbsp; If he or she were to spend $449. he or she would get a tiny bit more than 5%.&nbsp; If he or she spends $500 to $999, he or she wold get $50 back, which offers the same percentage reduction/savings. Offers scale upward from the lowest level of spending upward to a maximum of $1,000 if you spend $5,000 or more.&nbsp; Notice that spending $5,000 gets you a savings of 25%.&nbsp; Wow, what a deal!&nbsp; The problem is that if you stayed out of Zale's and did not spend $250 there on day 1, you would still have $250 on day 2, but if you spend that $250, you would be down $225.&nbsp; So, spending money at Zale's doesn't save you money unless you are determined to spend $250 and don't go to a store that gives you a better break.&nbsp; In short, while a penny saved may not be a penny earned, a penny spent is definitely neither a penny earned nor a penny saved. I am lucky.&nbsp; My wife has never demanded or even hinted she wanted diamonds or any other kind of pricey jewelry.&nbsp; I think I did once buy some pearl stud earrings in a fit of romantic fervor,&nbsp; but that would have been a long time ago.&nbsp; I suggest to men that they flee from any woman who really, really wants jewelry, other than, say, an engagement ring.&nbsp; My wife and I got married with no engagement ring and no wedding rings, but when we went to Scotland for a couple of months the next Summer, we had a craft jeweler make us matching wedding rings.&nbsp; I suppose that made us leg
l.&nbsp; It sure made my mother-in-law happier.&nbsp; It is possible to spend money on other, probably more sensible things. An Israeli linguist seems to think she has turned the linguistic world upside down with her new meaning for the word "most."&nbsp; A UPN article states Professor Mira Ariel of Tel Aviv University says her research "is quite shocking for the linguistics world" and proves some of her fellow linguists are wrong in their definition of the word "most." She claims that we linguists believe that "most" generally means 51 percent to 99 percent of a group of people or objects. but that in a survey she and her colleagues did, a number of persons understood "most" to mean about 80 percent to 95 percent of a group and not the much larger range of 51 percent to 99 percent. One very serious problem with her claims is that no self-respecting linguist would ever say that "most" means 51 percent to 99 percent of a group or means '80 percent to 95 percent of a group.'&nbsp; This is just now how we use the word "mean." Professor Ariel seems not to understand the distinction between "meaning" and "use".&nbsp; It very well may be that people use "most" in a proposition like "Most Ps are Q" in circumstances in which 80-95% of the relevant Ps have the property Q.&nbsp; But that is not what it means .&nbsp; That is how we use it.&nbsp; I am not sure how to characterize what it means but I am sure that that is not what it means. If I say, that most Ps are Q and it turns out that 97% of the Ps are Q is what I said false?&nbsp; Surely not. And if it turns out that 75% of the Ps are Q, is what I said false"?&nbsp; Again, surely not.&nbsp; This may not be how people generally use "most" but the meaning of "most," whatever it is, is consistent with these two claims being true and so long as that is true, then we can be sure that Professor Ariel is wrong about what "most" means. After Obama was inaugurated, he made himself excessively visible.&nbsp; Anyone in show business knows that you always leave them wanting more.&nbsp; The problem is that Obama kept himself front and center, shoiwing up on TV virtually every day.&nbsp; Before we had time to want to see him again, there he was announcing this or that new appointment, putting forth this or that new policy, or giving an interview.&nbsp; As a result, Obama fatigue has set in and that has left him very vulnerable to the lies being told by the health industry about his and the Democratic Congressional health care bill, Fox News, and whoever else feels animus toward him, including especially those who harbor ill-feeling toward African Americans. Naturally, the Antis will say they are pure of thought and that their objections to Obama are based on his actions as well as his apparent inaction.&nbsp; The Rasmussen Report s don't bear them out. Seventy-four percent (74%) of African-Americans Strongly Approve along with just 19% of white voters (see other recent demographic highlights from the tracking poll). Among all voters, just 34% now give the President good or excellent marks on his handling of the economy while 47% say he is doing a poor job in that arena. On national security issues, 42% say good or excellent while 41% say poor. Sixty-three percent (63%) of voters believe that political correctness kept the military from preventing the Fort Hood shootings .&nbsp; So, what we see is a striking division between Blacks and Whites as to how he is doing, which is a bit of a give away that racial attitudes are coloring perceptions.&nbsp; That sort of thing didn't keep him from being elected but given the continued high unemployment and many other issues, he is guarnteed not to have a second term.&nbsp; As James Carville famously said, "It's the economy, stupid." The last of these three items is especially interesting.&nbsp; It is clear that the military knew that Major Hasan was a Muslim and that he was disgruntled.&nbsp; Naturally in a country Bush poisoned with his constant drumbeat of "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", "9/11", etc, and given the disposition of people to posit conspiracies wherever they see something they don't understand, right-wingers and various and sundry other nutcases are sure this was part of a terrorist plot. Conspiracy theories are the refuge of those who have agendas or are laboring in ignorance.&nbsp; I recall the theories graduate students had about admissions policies in my university department.&nbsp; Early on we used&nbsp; a Master's exam to help determine who would be admitted to the Doctoral progrm.&nbsp;&nbsp; A minority would not be admitted and the theory emerged that we had a quota, never mind that limiting the number of students we admitted actually hurt the department economically. I first encountered the theory that Major Hasan's actions were the result of a terrorist plot on the Dennis Miller show and that political correctness, the bane of right wing, was in full flower in this case.&nbsp; I was rather surprised.&nbsp; Naturally, the military is reluctant to jump to the view that Hasan was acting out of an anti-American or anti-military political stance.&nbsp; That would be beyond stupid, bordering on being imbecilic. Not so, the right wing in America tells us.&nbsp; At Right Pundits we find Why are we able to so easily label Malik Nadal Hasan a terrorist? The fact speaks for itself. He is just as much a domestic terrorist as Timothy McVeigh was labeled so for his heinous act in Oklahoma City. And while McVeigh perpetuated his act from afar in silence, Malik Nadal Hasan shouted anti-American political views at his victims as he mowed them down with automatic weapons. &nbsp;The first thing I learned about Major Hasan is that he really, really, really didn't want to go to Iraq.&nbsp; The military is not disposed to worry overmuch about where soldiers do and do not want to be posted, but they probably should in some cases.&nbsp; This would have been one. The title of this article is "Malik Nadal Hasan: Muslim Terrorist Challenges Obama’s Timidity."&nbsp; I suppose this could be more misleading but I don't know how.&nbsp; I seriously doubt that Obama told the military how it should go about its investigation or how it should present the facts to the public.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Obama is vulnerable to any attack on anything American by any Muslim.&nbsp; Its a right wing freebie. Obama neeeds to do the following by next year at this time. 1. Get the health care bill in place. 2.&nbsp; Somehow get unemployment to turn around.&nbsp; I can think of some ways -- how about using unemployment benefits as subsidies to businesses who hire the uneployed for a year, say. 3.&nbsp; Get the hell out of Iraq. 4.&nbsp; Render Al Queda and the Talliban totally impotent. If he does 1 and 2, it is possible that he will get a second term.&nbsp; If he does 1-3, he will get one.&nbsp; If he gets all four he will be elected President for Life. Many years ago (1967 or so), I bought a wonderful Yamaha 250 cc motorcycle, the manual for which had this instruction for shifting gears: Tachometer tells the moment to do. Unfortunately, the RPMs given for gear shiftng kept this very fast motorcycle operating a little slower than a motor scooter. One evening, I told a friend who had ridden behind the original owner that the instructions couldn't be right and he offered to ride behind me and tell me when to shift. He did not look at the tachometer. He used his ears. I suppose the manual could have said. Ears tell the moment to do. Once I got the pitch right, I was golden. I suspect that some junior executive at Yahama persuaded his bosses that his English was excellent and he could ably translate the manual. On balance he didn't do badly. Today, I happend across a web site while hunting for information as to what might be down the line for Blackberry phones given the buzz surrounding the iPhone and the new Androd phones. I came across this paragraph. The Blackberry mobile phones are looking professionals and stylish mobile phone with can peoples are attract to this phone. Blackberry is the smart phones which is the most popular in the world with its charming features. It offers accessibility to an extensive variety of applications many wireless instruments across the world. It provides accessibility to an extensive variety of applications on several wireless instruments across the globe. by data and other services. This piece of prose shocked me even more than that Yamaha manual. This articale comes from Weblineindia, a link to which is associated with the blog title. That's what's shocking. If I have prejudices in regard to India, they are (1) Indians are very smart and very well-educated; (2) Many if not most Indians know English either natively or fluently; and (3) India has a bunch of great cuisines. I clicked on the link and the first paragraph that popped up was this one: Now a day ecommerce is a very popular among the internet users, so what is Ecommerce? People are habituated to sell and purchase their products or any types of items on the internet, its called ecommerce, and to online sell products you need ecommerce web... So, it only gets worse. It is possible that these articles were written in some regional Indian language and run through some bad translating program. More likely, we are dealing with people who have big brains (see prejudice 1 above) but smal English language centers (see apparently false prejudice 2). These articles are represented as "free content for your website or blog," which further confirms the axiom that you get what you pay for. I know that what I am writing is rather snobish, possibly even mean-spirited, for I would seem to be making fun of people who are, after all, doing their best. To that, I say, "bullshit." If I planned to publish something in German or Spanish I sure as hell wouldn't translate it myself. Surely, if you are actually trying to inform people, to say nothing of sell things to them, you will want to do better than this: The Blackberry Solution is used to access mobile email and personal information. Also other of the self applications are also used. But the development Blackberr software for the solution of Blackberry. Also Blackberry application, for assistance if issues arise. This reads as if they are offering some sort of spyware ("access personal information"). If that isn't true, then they are very engaging in linguistic self-abuse.

" I didn’t do that on purpose, I just like the smell of Vetiver ," Cabic said. He was sitting on a front porch before a recent show at Covington, Kentucky’s Southgate House. Cabic is a soothing presence blessed with a deep plume of energy inside of him, and it's obvious he's not the kind of musician who sees a lot of late nights on tour with too much drink. On this particular evening, he had the tranquility of a man reading a book in the sun on the first warm day of spring. When I told him I’d had a rough weekend he said, " I’m sorry, why? " in a tone implying maybe my grandma had died, or I’d had a bad breakup. A little embarrassed, I explained it wasn’t so bad. I was only trying to make the point that his music would be perfect right now – a restorative and upbeat experience like having a cup of black tea while working through a book of brain teasers, or an ice-cold Arnie Palmer on a hot and sticky day. He said people often describe grounding experiences they’ve had with his music, like the couple from Atlanta who drove to Florida and back with a van full of screaming kids. Tight Knit never left the stereo, and was the only thing that held their sanity together. But Cabic usually doesn’t agree with what is written about his music. " The way that Vetiver has been described - I don’t feel like anyone's ever really done it correctly ," he said. " A lot of times people use the same archetypes or other artists that would have been mentioned once in a one-sheet or something ." It's not that it's negative, he says, but is composed of tired comparisons that seem to be cobbled together in a hurry. "I mean, there’s some shred of kinship there sonically, but to say I sound like George Harrison does a disservice to George Harrison,” he said. " I don’t do any of the number of things that people think of when they think of George Harrison. I don’t sing spiritual lyrics, um, I wasn’t a Beatle ." And when the write-ups aren't about sonic comparison, they're usually some form of genre-chicanery. " And so my music was commonly referred to as the least-freaky-of-the-freak-folk-people ," he said. " I always thought what I was doing was accessible and poppy ." Vetiver : 3.7.10, Southgate House, Newport, KY : courtesy of CincyGroove.com ... Indeed Cabic is not a freak, and he says he doesn't make folk music – at least not on his last album. He is a guy with a work ethic using his gifts. At core of Vetiver are his voice and the songs he's so carefully gestated. Sometimes he spends a year tightening the arrangements around the track's " pop sensibility ," he said. The tightly woven tracks make for a seamless performance that can feel orchestral if he's playing with a cellist, or downright raucous if he decides to go heavy on electric guitar. Later that evening, at his Southgate House performance, about ninety audience members (in a room that fits hundreds) barely budged except for some heavy toe tapping and head nodding during Vetiver's one, long set. As he played his songs, Cabic’s mouth, shoulders and eyebrows shrank and expanded in unison like he was a conduit for some larger force, like he was expelling a grizzly bear’s soul from his somewhat slight frame. Vetiver : 3.7.10, Southgate House, Newport, KY : courtesy of CincyGroove.com ... His backing band surrounded him with energy and each song had an apex. The sum total was like a well-written story with no errant sentences: each song like a paragraph that drew me in, delivered energy, and then set me down right at the moment I was about to cave in to my urge to get up and dance. It didn’t take any prodding for the relatively small but captive audience to make enough noise to invite them back on stage for a three-song encore, during which at least a few people could be seen awkwardly trying to tug their friends out onto the empty dance floor.

I've got another book coming out from Quirk Books today; " The Sherlock Holmes Handbook: The Methods and Mysteries of the World's Greatest Detective," by Ransom Riggs . The book is full of interior illustrations and it's a fun read for any fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's most loved character. Originally I was given the task of creating a look similar to the original Sidney Paget illustrations that appeared with the published stories, but it was too daunting a task to handle. Thankfully they were happy with the look I was able to provide, and I think they conveyed the right atmosphere for this kind of subject matter. This project required a lot of versatility in that I had to illustrate a variety of scenarios as well as objects and animals. It was a fun challenge and I love the design of the book, done by Doogie Horner over at Quirk; it looks and feels like an old hardcover novel from the 19th century. Here are some samples: Sherlock experiencing a bit of malaise. Sherlock Holmes exhibiting his skills in Bartistu. A cane is not necessarily a sign of a handicap. Move over Errol Flynn. Shedding a clever disguise. The Hound of The Baskervilles. The Victorian Opium Den as described in Holmes' world. The Baker Street Irregulars. The avid beekeeper. An accomplished violinist. The demise of Professor Moriarty. The good folks at Quirk books are coming up with another monster mash-Up book this September; Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. It was a dream project to work on all the interior illustrations. The beautiful cover art was created by Lars Leetaru. This was a very rewarding project due to the fact that I was able to illustrate such a wide variety of cool miscellany: sea monsters, underwater sea bases, giant pirates, gynormous lobsters, and intricate underwater diving suits! It was pretty much the reason I became an illustrator! Thankfully I can show two illustrations from the book, which comes out September 15. Many praises must be given to Doogie Horner and Jason Rekulak for having faith in me to get the work done. They gave me good direction and were enthusiastic about the artwork I showed them throughout the months it took to complete the title. Click on the title link above to reserve your copy at Amazon! As some of you know, I haven't been the most ardent keeper of my blog. There's a number of explanations (excuses) I could pilfer from to explain my abscence-the biggest being my involvement in some book illustration projects i've been entreched in for the past year. A couple of them I can share with you, some I can't... Last year I was approached by Quirk Books with an offer to illustrate a new addition to their Secret Lives series, The Secret Lives of the Supreme Court . It was easily the most extensive project I've ever been involved in; 35 two color illustrations + cover art. With some luck, and some patience from my enduring wife, I was able to meet the deadlines and come out of it all unscathed. Here's a sample of some of my favorites from the series: Antony Scalia Clarence Thomas Frank Murphy Harold Blackmun John Roberts Louis Brandeis Sandra Day O'connor Thurgood Marshall William Howard Taft William Rehnquist William Brennan The process was pen and ink colored in Photoshop. Looking at the work now I have mixed feelings about it. I'm proud of some of the illustrations, and embarrassed by some of the others. All in all that's not a bad thing...it's good in some ways to feel a little unsatisfied, only because it can push you to get better in the long run. Many thanks to Doogie Horner at Quirk Books, for guiding me through the whole process and pushing me creatively, as well as campaigning on my behalf for the project. And also many thanks to my wife Mary, who put up with my long nights and my fuzzy sleep deprived brain for so many months. Next up; a peak at the cool Sherlock Holmes project I had the great fortune of working on! Here's a sketch for a personal illustration project. I'm working on updating my portfolio and decided to take on some projects that would get my butt in gear. The concept for this illustration was kids who suffer from the heavy expectations of the adults in their lives. Next up: finished inks. A rough sketch for a new illustration. I'll post the various stages of development as I complete them. I've been lying really low for the past couple of months after having completed a large illustration assignment for a book that's coming out in May of this year. I'll post details about that project soon. Now it's time for me to crack the whip and get productive-It's so easy to fall into the trap of doing nothing... Howdy folks! Where the "F" have I been you ask? Well, pretty much in my studio, holed away working on a book illustration project which I can't divulge any details about yet. But I do have a funny tale to tell y'all about. A few days ago I got an email from a fellow out in North Carolina who had a funny story to tell about an old drawing I did some years ago. Here's the skinny; Hello Eugene. I work for a major corporation and my job is in R&amp;D printing t-shirts. Every now and then, I get time to do some for myself and my friends. Well, a few weeks ago I decided to google some Tweedy pictures because one of my good friends bachelor party was coming up and we love Wilco. Anyway, I get to like page 30 on google images and there is your artwork. It's perfect for a t-shirt, so I edited it and increased the resolution for printing(about 300 dpi). I put it on a shirt and give it to him and I thought that was the end of it. Well, weekend before last my friends were going to see Wilco in Charleston SC (we live in NC) and I couldn't go but my friend went and wore your shirt. He worked his way to the front(like he always does-that idiot) and believe it or not, he could tell Tweedy kept looking at him. Then after a song, Tweedy stops the show and says "that is the most disgusting shirt I have ever seen. That doesn't even look like me". Kind of joking of course. Then he plays another song and after that one he still can't let it go. So he starts talking about it some more "I look like the Geico caveman, and my nose is bigger than that". After another song, he can't take it anymore so he helps my buddy onstage and asks the crowd what they think, smiling the whole time. He even tells my buddy to hold out the tshirt and then he puts his face beside it and asks the crowd. Anyway, he had a huge smile on his face the whole time. My buddy ends up stopping the show for 5 minutes because of your artwork and he gives Tweedy a hug and shakes Nels Cline's hand as well. It made my buddy's life. Here is an excerpt from a local newspaper about it: During the show, Tweedy noticed a fan in the front row wearing a shirt with an image of the singer he found unflattering. 'I look like the Geico caveman,' exclaimed Tweedy, who proceeded to bring the fan onstage to model the image for the rest of the house . Charleston News Story For some context, here's the image Time to get some new promotional materials out there! I decided to create an image solely for the purpose of using it on a postcard. Plus I needed a project to get me back on track with my work. I'm using a large format card for this design so I don't lose too much detail. Here I go with yet another take on the Joker-figured it's a good start to the new moleskine...
Kissinger warns of possible "war of civilizations" - Yahoo! News : WASHINGTON (AFP) - Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger warned that Europe and the United States must unite to head off a "war of civilizations" arising from a nuclear-armed Middle East. In an opinion column in the Washington Post, the renowned foreign policy expert said the potential for a "global catastrophe" dwarfed lingering transatlantic mistrust left over from the Iraq war. "A common Atlantic policy backed by moderate Arab states must become a top priority, no matter how pessimistic previous experience with such projects leaves one," Kissinger wrote. "The debate sparked by the Iraq war over American rashness vs. European escapism is dwarfed by what the world now faces. "Both sides of the Atlantic should put their best minds together on how to deal with the common danger of a wider war merging into a war of civilizations against the background of a nuclear-armed Middle East." Kissinger wrote that the big threat lay in the erosion of nation states and the emergence of transnational groups. Iran was at the centre of the challenge, he said, with its support for Hezbollah, radical Shiite groups in Iraq and its nuclear program. Washington must accept that many European nations were more optimistic about talks designed to convince Iran to halt uranium enrichment -- a process Tehran denies is aimed at making weapons, he wrote. Lining up to enrich uranium - Editorials &amp; Commentary - International Herald Tribune : Never underestimate the potential for erratic policy when economic and political interests collide, even when the policy involves preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This happened last month when, in rapid succession, Argentina, Australia and South Africa joined a growing list of countries interested in enriching uranium for commercial purposes. That is the same activity that Iran claims as its inalienable right, and that the United States, the European Union, Russia and China insist must be halted in the interest of nonproliferation. Is it fair or feasible to allow some countries to enrich uranium while attempting to prevent others from doing it? The answer is not simple. It turns on a number of technical, economic and political considerations. The technical dimension is most straightforward. It pertains to the dual purpose of uranium enrichment: to produce fuel for civilian reactors and explosive material for nuclear weapons. It is not surprising, therefore, that most of the countries that have an active or latent uranium-enrichment industry also possess, once made, or tried to acquire nuclear weapons. Today, most of the arguments in support of new enrichment capacity are couched in economic terms, generally linked to the buzz about major global expansion in nuclear energy. Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, for example, portray their renewed interest in terms of projected domestic consumption and new export opportunities. In fact, current global enrichment capacity exceeds demand. The projected boom in nuclear-energy development in most countries has yet to be matched by major new orders, and the ability of newcomers to supplant the entrenched suppliers is problematic. Moreover, the financial costs of reviving antiquated and previously uneconomical enrichment facilities in Argentina and South Africa are likely to be enormous. So other factors are at play. Almost all the new and prospective entrants in the enrichment business appear anxious to establish their credentials as having existing technology in place. Driving this process, in part, is the perception that all countries will soon be divided into uranium enrichment "haves" (suppliers) and "have-nots" (customers) under various proposals to establish multinational nuclear fuel centers and fuel-supply arrangements. These proposals include President George W. Bush's call two years ago for the Nuclear Suppliers Group to refuse to sell enrichment technology to any state that did not already possess a full-scale, functioning enrichment plant, and the idea promoted about the same time by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, for a five-year moratorium on new enrichment plants in order to buy time for developing more equitable means to ensure fuel supplies while stemming proliferation. More recently, the United States and Russia have proposed that a small set of countries would serve as enrichment providers while all others would forego such technology. But the basis for becoming an approved enricher remains unclear. While the United States opposes allowing Iran to enrich uranium, Dennis Spurgeon, the U.S. Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, recently said that "special rules" apply to Australia and Canada because they "have the majority of economically recoverable uranium resources." These rules appears founded more on political grounds that distinguish between allies and adversaries. Such a policy of exceptionalism is at odds with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is also a recipe for failure, as the history of U.S.-Iranian nuclear cooperation in the 1970s should make clear, since today's friend could become tomorrow's foe. There is no foolproof means of promoting peaceful nuclear energy while preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Perhaps the best way of resolving the conundrum is to provide inducements to all states that voluntarily forsake uranium enrichment. These inducements should include guaranteed access to nuclear fuel for all states in good standing with the nonproliferation treaty - an approach that will be explored this month at a special IAEA conference in Vienna on "Assurances of Fuel Supply and Nonproliferation." To be effective, these assurances will have to be nondiscriminatory and consistent with the nonproliferation treaty. Such an approach will not guarantee an end to abuse of sensitive nuclear technology, but it should reduce the number of states joining the uranium enrichment queue. Charles D. Ferguson is a fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. William C. Potter is director of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. They are the principal authors of "The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism." Never underestimate the potential for erratic policy when economic and political interests collide, even when the policy involves preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.

Iran Proposes Negotiations on Nuclear Stand-Off - washingtonpost.com : PARIS, Sept. 12 -- Iran has proposed extensive negotiations with Western powers to resolve the stand-off over its nuclear program, but it is threatening to cut off talks and other cooperation if the case against it proceeds in the U.N. Security Council, as advocated by the United States. In a detailed and sometimes rambling response given to Western powers three weeks ago in reply to a set of proposals made by them last June, Iran stops short of rejecting demands to halt its nuclear enrichment program, saying the issue can be resolved in negotiations. The response was made public on a Web site Tuesday. HIR | Understanding the US position (Israel v. Lebanon - 2006) : As shown in this series, Hezbollah is not a ‘militia,’ as much of the media would have you believe: it is an antisemitic terrorist army of extermination.[1] A year ago exactly, the Philadelphia Inquirer explained the tremendous symbolic importance that Hezbollah has for the terrorist enemies of Israel: “Hezbollah now controls the south [of Lebanon]. It is viewed throughout the region as the one armed Arab group that has defeated Israel by suicide bombers and guns [because Hezbollah claims that Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 chased out by Hezbollah’s terrorism].”[2] Consistent with this, the same article explained that “the United States labels Hezbollah a terrorist organization.” This -- in combination with the oft-repeated US claim to love and support Israel -- leads some to conclude that the United States ruling elite must be opposed to Hezbollah. However, government officials routinely conceal the truth with public statements -- we all know this. Therefore, the public statements of government officials are not a reliable guide for the social scientist. Happily, the social scientist can examine the foreign policy behaviors of states, and in these behaviors the ruling elites that control state policy reveal their true values and goals. To understand the US ruling elite’s real attitudes toward both Israel and Hezbollah, then, let us first take a look at how US officials have reacted to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the past, and then at how they are reacting this time. The history ___________ A decade ago exactly, in 1996, Hezbollah escalated dramatically its rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. When Israel retaliated, there were casualties, including civilians at a UN base in Qana, in southern Lebanon. Consistent with the general anti-Israeli thrust of the media, Israel rather than Hezbollah was blamed for this, even though 1) it was Hezbollah that attacked first; 2) it is Hezbollah that as a matter of principle targets civilians when it attacks; and 3) Hezbollah had fired its rockets against Israeli civilians from “a position close to the UN post, thus drawing the errant Israeli artillery fire” to the UN base.[3] An ally of Israel would have blamed the terrorists who endanger both the civilians they attack and the civilians they hide among. Instead, the US used the worldwide diplomatic attack on Israel in order to produce a state of affairs that defies belief: “For 10 days, Warren Christopher, then the secretary of state, bounced between Damascus, Beirut and Jerusalem until he finally was able to get the 1996 cease-fire arrangement that restricted Israel and Hezbollah to fighting each other without terrorizing civilian populations.”[4] In other words, a decade ago, the United States went out of its way 1) to restrain Israel from crossing over and destroying Hezbollah; and 2) to guarantee Hezbollah’s ability to attack Israel, even though Hezbollah’s ideology, as HIR has shown, is simply to destroy the Jewish state through genocide![5] HIR | Why Jewish patriots should thank Hezbollah (Israel v. Lebanon - 2006) : Dear Readers, I have seen much pessimism from Jewish patriots in the wake of the ‘cease-fire’ that the United States and the United Nations have sought to impose in order to protect Hezbollah, and which Israel’s leaders have accepted. Many have characterized the result as one where Israel lost the war, and they have lamented what they perceive as the damage to the earlier perception that Israel was invincible, with negative consequences to the deterrence of Israel’s enemies. My own view is less pessimistic. It is certainly true that Ehud Olmert lost the war by agreeing to a ‘cease-fire’ that, like previous US and UN-brokered cease-fires in southern Lebanon, will protect the antisemitic terrorists and allow them to re-arm. But in my view Ehud Olmert was going to lose whatever war he was called upon to wage. I don't think he is a patriot. So the question for Jewish patriots is this: Which war would you rather have Ehud Olmert lose? Remember that Ehud Olmert was rushing to cleanse the Jews out of the West Bank -- like his mentor, Ariel Sharon, had done with the Jews who lived in Gaza -- in order to turn this territory over completely to the terrorists. For those paying attention to geopolitical realities, as opposed to the pro-Oslo propaganda statements of US and Israeli officials, the probable outcome of Ehud Olmert’s policies was not difficult to foresee. Relatively low-level but constant Hezbollah attacks from the north, and PLO/Hamas attacks from Gaza in the south, would have made the relocation of the evacuated West Bank Jews to the north and south of Israel impractical, particularly given that a stream of Jews native to those areas would be fleeing the Hamas/Hezbollah attacks towards the relative safety of the Tel-Aviv-Yafo area (as indeed many have now fled). Tel-Aviv-Yafo already contains about half of all Israeli Jews, and as a result of Olmert’s ‘convergence’ and the terrorist attacks from north and south the Israeli Jews would have been further concentrated there. Now, the West Bank and Gaza, according to a 1967 Pentagon study done immediately after the Six Day War, are strategic territories that, if relinquished, will guarantee the destruction of Israel.[1] This Pentagon study was not carried out for Israel’s benefit and Israel was not informed of its conclusions. It was kept secret and made public only many years later because somebody filed suit to have it released under the Freedom of Information Act. That the US ruling elite did not share with the Israelis its view of the vulnerability of the Jewish state, but instead pressured Israel to participate in the Oslo process that has for purpose to hand over precisely these indispensable territories to the antisemitic terrorists, is consistent with the entire history of US foreign policy towards the Jewish people and state, which has been a constant sponsoring of Israel’s enemies and sabotaging of Israeli self-defense.[2] USATODAY.com - Iran to continue pursuing nuclear technology, supreme leader says : "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's supreme leader (Emperor Darth Sidious) Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday that Tehran will continue to pursue nuclear technology, despite a U.N. Security Council deadline to suspend uranium enrichment by the end of the month or face the threat of economic and diplomatic sanctions. 'The Islamic Republic of Iran has made its own decision and in the nuclear case, God willing, with patience and power, will continue its path,' Khamenei was quoted as saying by state television. He accused the United States of putting pressure on Iran despite Tehran's assertions that its nuclear program was peaceful. 'Arrogant powers and the U.S. are putting their utmost pressure on Iran while knowing Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons,' he said. Khamenei's declaration came on the eve of Iran's self-imposed Aug. 22 deadline to respond to a Western incentives package for it to roll back its nuclear program." Turkey halts Lebanon-bound aircraft from Iran, Syria - Haaretz - Israel News : "Turkish authorities have prevented five Iranian airplanes and a Syrian aircraft from flying into Lebanon, suspecting them of transporting arms to Hezbollah, Haaretz learned on Monday. The Turkish Hurriyet newspaper reported on Monday that one of the aircraft that Turkish authorities forced to land at the Diyarbakir airport in eastern Turkey belongs to a private Iranian airline. According to Hurriyet and other reports in Turkish media, the aircraft was not allow
d leave Diyarbakir for Lebanon, after American intelligence reports indicated the plane carried three missile launchers and containers with Chinese C-802 land-to-sea missiles, identical to the missile that hit an Israel Navy battleship in July. The detained aircraft entered Turkish airspace after having been prevented from flying over Iraq. Turkish authorities would not elaborate on whether these actions are part of a new policy. But analysts believe that Ankara has acquiesced to American and Israeli requests to impose stricter surveillance on the passage of Iranian aircraft and their cargo. Syria's status in relation to the new surveillance procedures is still unclear." Olmert rules out peace talks with Syria : "KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel -- Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday ruled out a resumption of negotiations with Syria at this time, saying Damascus must first end its support for militant groups. Olmert spoke just hours after a minister in his Cabinet urged a resumption of negotiations and said Israel should give back the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria. Israel accuses Syria and Iran of arming and supporting Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas who fired nearly 4,000 rockets at Israel in the 34-day war that ended last week. However, during the war, Israel went to great lengths to keep Syria out of the conflict, apparently to avoid opening another front or closing future peace options. After the war, Syrian President Bashar Assad signaled he is moving closer to Iran. He delivered a hardline speech in praise of Hezbollah and warned that future Arab generations might succeed with force where peace talks have failed so far - a reference to the Golan Heights, the plateau Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War." By refusing to enter peace negotiations Olmert sends a distinct message to Syria...He's for war!!

Bobby of the excellent Kitsune Noir asked me to do a bicycle-themed illustration for his Desktop Wallpaper Project . You can download the size of your choice here: The Desktop Wallpaper Project Featuring Ward Jenkins One thing I like about wallpapers is using the design as a way to organize your folders. Even though the arrows here are part of the composition behind the girl riding her bike, they also offer the user a chance to group certain folders together, for fun or whatever. For instance, all your folders that feature current projects can go on the bright green arrow, the ones that need immediate attention go on the red arrow, etc. Enjoy! Thought I'd share with you some of my favorite quotes that speak to me on so many levels. I notice a theme here. See if you can pick up on it: "I have forced myself to contradict myself in order to avoid conforming to my own taste." - Marcel Duchamp "Rules are what the artist breaks; the memorable never emerged from a formula." - William Bernbach , co-founder of legendary DDB ad agency. "I never had to compromise myself. It was always me, doing what was comfortable, and relaying the message that I didn't have to be taught to be creative and do good things. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm here and I want to be heard. I come from the streets, I painted on subways, and I feel my work is important. I want people to see it —I want to influence others." - Dondi White (aka DONDI - RIP) Hi guys, sorry for the inactivity lately. Still working on the book, among other things. Trying to manage my time wisely and well, that's a pretty hard task for me apparently. But I'm almost done, and soon I'll have some stuff to share here. I promise. Thanks for hanging on. I promise the wait will be worth your while! I think 2010 is going to be a great year for me. Heck, 2009 wasn't anything to sneeze at, I have to admit. It was pretty much a great year, if you ask me. 2010, now, I think will be another winner. It's certainly starting off well: I'm currently working on my second children's book. To be published by Simon & Schuster in the Spring of 2011. I know, a whole year off, but I'm sure you can manage. Deadline is looming, so I best be on my way. Merry Christmas, everyone. With love, The Ward-O-Matic The Christmas Angel Book by William Dugan. ©1965 Golden Press, Western Publishing Company, Inc. William (or Bill) Dugan is one of my favorite illustrators, creating some of the more interesting and colorful books for children during the midcentury era. There were certain details that Bill focused on for some of his pieces, like the hair and fabic, that stood out from the usual stuff. We read this each year for Christmas. If you never saw a white Christmas back in the day, you didn't have to fret. The stores always carried some instant snow for you to spray on your windows, right? To make it even more festive, you could also grab some stencils and make some pretty nifty snow decorations up on the windows themselves. Nice. Here's a couple of packs of Christmas stencils from the 50's for you to check out: All the stencils in this Paas Christmas Stencil Kit are intact and have never been punched out. I think this is the time when you say &quot;How jolly!&quot; Because that's what we say when we see a Santa Claus face. He's a jolly fellow. All the stencils are still in this one, too, but have been punched out—two with some paint residue. Guess they didn't want to use the fake snow. Love the cool illustration on the cover of this kit. Dig the kids. The ones that have paint on them are the &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; one (they used red AND white) and the angel praying. And here, you've got a can of Instant Snow: I took this photo last year, during the freak massive snow storm that hit Portland around Christmas time. There's a winter wonderland right behind me when I took this shot. On the back there's a warning: CAUTION Contents under pressure. Do not puncture. Do not throw into fire or incinerator. Keep out of the reach of children. Do not allow children or pets to eat snow. Gotta remember that last one. Howdy, kids. Hope you're getting into the Christmas-y mood. I know that there's snow on the ground over half of the country right now (well, I'm pretty sure it is, I think), so that's a good thing, right? Unless you're having to go out in said weather and get stuck in parking lots and long lines at the Post Office. In that case, sorry. Well, to help you get in the mood, I've been saving these things for you. A couple of booklets, one from 1958, the other from 1954: KVP Season's Greetings: Christmas 1958 : a booklet of carols for Christmastime. Illustrator: Hank Kolodziej. In case you want to know, KVP stands for Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Company . You're welcome. By the way, I did a little research on Hank Kolodziej, and all I could find was this item on Ebay and a mention in this exhibit on automobile ads during the 60's and 70's, called Drawing Power: Motor City Ad Art in the Age of Muscle and Chrome . Awesome. Sounds like my kinda guy. Here's some of the other spreads in this booklet (there's more in my Flickr ): The image above is the inside cover, front (on left) and back (on right). The following is a little book on Christmas Trees, barely 12 pages long. Something I found in a bundle of various ephemeral items at some antique shop. Didn't really know what it was, but once I opened it up and saw all the wonderful drawings, I had to get it. Plus, the text is by T. S. Eliot. I mean, c'mon! Great stuff. The Cultivation of Christmas Trees , by T. S. Eliot. Typography, binding and decorations by Enrico Arno. ©1954, 1956. Enrico Arno has a great style here. This book looks pretty interesting. I might have to buy it. The note in the corner says: "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year - Ward Taylor 1956." Now, what are the odds that a guy named "Ward" actually gave this as a gift over 50 years ago? And that another Ward found it? Boggles the mind. Oh, and one more thing. Thought I'd get into the spirit of things by creating a new icon for Flickr & Twitter. 'Tis the Season! Here's to a great and wonderful Christmas Season, guys. A gentle reminder that the Early Bird Special: FREE SHIPPING over at The Ward-O-Matic Shop ends at the end of the day TOMORROW! That's Sunday, December 6th. If this'll make it easier for you to decide on whether or not you'd like to order a print, I doodle something different on each and every shipping invoice that's included with the shipment. Here's one example (actual doodle on an actual invoice, scanned for your pleasure): The character varies, but always done with a smile. It gets better, too. I also draw something special on the front (and back!) of each envelope I mail out. Done with marker on study cardboard mailer, I never sketch anything out first, just start drawin'! The character on the front is almost the same, called "The Dreamer", he (or she) conjures up the addressee's name and address for each envelope. (Sorry, didn't get a scan or photo for this post. Maybe next time.) On the back, something unique to every single buyer. Here are two examples: I've had people tell me that they save the envelopes, which totally makes me happy. Now, don't you want to buy a print today? Of course you do. Merry Christmas!

Sometimes a simple "WTF" will not suffice and you just gotta sat out loud... WHAT THE FUCK?! Bran There's a fine line between a Make A Wish Telethon and a David Lynch film. Bran Only an African-American legend like Sidney Poitier could have had the skill, sensitivity and all out brass balls to direct a film with such delicate and controversial subject matter. I can only imagine how good Mo' Money could have been under the thoughtful guidance of Morgan Freeman or maybe even as Al Sharpton's directorial debut. Bran Ah, Cruising . You taught me so much. You opened my eyes to the sweet hip shakin' moves that I will use for the rest of my life. Most importantly, you gave me the ever so valuable lessons in hanky code. Want a fist in your bum? Red hanky, right pocket. Wanna pee on a stranger? Yellow hanky, left pocket. "I love it when we're cruisin' together ." Bran Working at a video store, I used to try and sell this film like this: "Hey, you liked Running Man right? Yeah? Well you'll love this. It's exactly like Running Man except instead of it taking place in the future, it takes place during the Depression. Instead of cool laser fights and reckless violence there is slow dancing and some light tandem jogging. Instead of Schwarzenegger, you get a young Red Buttons . Sound like a winner?" Bran Hey, I'm an 7 year old facing adversity in the ghetto and I just won the Kentucky Derby. Sounds great, but have you ever lifted a fucking boat over a fucking mountain? No? Get back to me when you have. Bran Seriously, shit is really like this on Mars. My dad told me. His slow pitch baseball team used to play away games on Mars and he swears he saw at least one tripple tittied lady at the pub. Don't call my dad a liar, he fought in the space wars! Or was it 'Nam? Wait, neither. Sorry. Bran Whenever I listen to Frank Stallone's "Far From Over", I always feel like I should go for a jog. Bran

At Creation Moments, Ian Taylor starts by asking a scientific question about embryogenesis: How do other cells know to hook up with each other to make our circulatory system, or form the heart? A very good question, and one which is central evo-devo . He then puts forward a hypothesis developed by William Dryer, that olfactory receptors are responsible for cell-cell guidance. An interesting hypothesis formed, in part, because you expresses these genes in nearly every cell of your body. Please Mr. Taylor, tell us more about olfactory genes: Mammals and humans have more than a thousand different olfactory genes. Yes, and more than half of yours are pseudogenes . They are, so far as we know, non-functional and a waste of chromosomal space. Awfully efficient that creator of yours. One or another of these crisscrosses each of your cell seven times. Whoa, that is one huge protein! Oh wait, it crisscrosses the cell membrane seven times . Minor error. Well, if you want to read more about olfactory receptors (and actually learn something) Larry Moran seems to like the subject . But the good thing is that here is a hypothesis that can be tested. So what have people found? Um, well, this hypothesis doesn't have much evidence to support it . From the journal article: A claim that ectopic OR expression may be in part governed by neutral changes is supported by several findings. First, the divergence in the expression patterns of human-mouse orthologous OR pairs in ectopic tissues is similar to that of randomly selected pairs. This observation generalizes a previously reported specific case for OR51E2, which was found to be over-expressed in human prostate [39,40], although minor expression could be detected also in brain. Its mouse ortholog was found predominantly in brain, and its rat ortholog in brain and liver [43]. Second, OR transcription was found here to be unbiased with respect to any particular OR subgroup in ectopic tissues (except for the human 7E subfamily members, see below), as indicated by the approximate fit to a Poisson distribution. We note, though, that other studies have reported up to 300-fold difference in the levels of ORs transcription in mouse olfactory epithelium [5,16]. Last, OR pseudogenes were found here to be expressed in ectopic tissues at similar levels to those of intact genes. In contrast, in olfactory epithelium, where chemosensory functionality is expected, OR pseudogenes were found to be significantly less expressed than intact genes [16]. In short, the expression of the olfactory receptors appears to be random when measured by tissue, by species, by receptor subgroup, and by pseudogene vs. functional gene. That last one is important; the genes that don't do anything are translated just as much as the the genes that do. Maybe more work will turn up something, but for now the expression appears to be just noise. Not a big problem; most hypothesis end up not working so I doubt that anyone is losing sleep over this. Except maybe Mr. Taylor (from the original link): If [this hypothesis is] so, this system of knitting our unborn bodies together is an elegant and precise product of a loving Creator. So, does that mean that you now believe we aren't the product of a loving creator? Maybe just the product of a spiteful creator? You let me know.

Image via Epic Win FTW Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. An oft heard comment on wingnut radio shows and the odd tobacconist shop is that cigarette taxes aren't about health, they are about money; politicians don't want people to stop smoking because the state would lose revenue. This is a bit hard to swallow since the strength of the connection between tobacco smoke inhalation and health is only slightly less than the strong nuclear force ; revenue from tobacco taxes have leveled off in the past decade; and the IRS allows medical deductions for smoking cessation programs and prescriptions . Sometimes, it just isn't about the money. Like say the neo-prohibitionists who run Pennsylvania's liquor laws : More than a dozen armed State Police officers conducted simultaneous raids last week on three popular Philadelphia bars known for their wide beer selections. The cops confiscated hundreds of bottles of expensive ales and lagers, now in State Police custody at an undisclosed location. The alleged offense: Although the bar owners had bought the beer legally from licensed Pennsylvania distributors and had paid all the necessary taxes, the police claimed that nobody had registered the precise names of the beers with the state Liquor Control Board - a process that requires the brewers or their importers to pay a $75 registration fee for each product they want to sell in Pennsylvania. Notice that this is not the fault of tavern owner; it is the fault of the brewer/importer for not properly registering the beer. But the tavern owners are the ones holding the bag. They were raided not because they didn't pay taxes on the beer, but because some of the beer wasn't officially approved. Even though some of it was: ...more than half the beer removed by the State Police was properly registered - but the cops couldn't find it on their lists because of "clerical errors" or "blatant ineptitude" between the police and the Liquor Control Board, with whom the officers were conferring by telephone. Pennsylvania has many archaic beer laws. Though some legislators are trying to change them , it is still easier for me to get a six-pack of Victory than someone who actually lives in Pennsylvania. And I will gladly pay the tax on it too. Image via Wikimedia Commons Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. An article on CNN caught my attention yesterday, concerning the blog of Jennifer McGruther . At NourishedKitchen she implemented a 28-day challenge to her readers for February: eat nothing but real food. From the CNN article: On Day One of the challenge, blogger Jennifer McGruther gave this instruction: Purge your pantry of processed foods. This meant everything with refined oils, white flour, sugar, low- and skimmed-milk products, margarine, processed cheeses, refined salt and dried pastas had to go. I understand the white flour, the bleaching process isn't necessary at all. But skim milk? Cheese? How do you make unprocessed cheese? Or sugar? Unprocessed salt is simply impossible. My dried pasta at home includes two ingredients: whole wheat and water. Does air drying it make it processed? Then I read her odd definition of processed foods: Processed food is defined as any food that has undergone a change of character. For example, edamame would be unprocessed, and tofu would be processed. Ugh, this is just a raw food diet that allows you to eat non-raw foods as long as you do it yourself. In no way, shape, or form does that represent what I would consider to be the definition of real food.- It's because of extremists like this that some have a completely misconstrued notion of what a foodie is . CNN, don't give those of us who care about food a bad name. Image via Wellesley College - "So what is your definition?" Good question. My non-specific answer would be "food pretending to be something it is not". Real cheese is made with milk and enzymes. Fake cheese adds oils, flavor enhancers, and preservatives. That doesn't mean I don't eat fake foods; it just means that I don't fool myself into thinking that Froot Loops are a totally awesome health food because now it is made with a little bit of whole grain wheat. Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. I really shouldn't be surprised that Ian Taylor gets his facts wrong; but I am surprised when Ian Taylor outright lies . Doesn't your religion have something to say about that? First, errors in fact concerning rings around planets: For example, we have learned that all five of the outer planets are surrounded by rings. Now, these transcripts are old, so it is understandable that he would be including Pluto as a planet (1). But, Pluto does not have rings . At best, there is the possibility that it may have rings based on computer models, but there are no data supporting that possibility. Sorry Ian, you are just plain wrong. The rings are only inches thick and comprised of dust and ice in neat bands; No, they are not inches thick. Saturn's rings are about 1 km thick in areas and the rings of Uranus exceed 100 m. That's not just off by a little; that is off by 3-4 orders of magnitude. That's like hopping on a Southwest flight from Orlando to Phoenix and getting dropped of at Disneyworld. Not to mention that some of those chunks of ice are several meters across by themselves, and you get the idea that Mr. Taylor doesn't know what the hell he is talking about. Go on: Every astronomer knows that the forces of the solar wind, of gravity, and the unavoidable laws of physics should have destroyed a planetary ring in less than a million years. The rings are stable because of the laws of physics; gravitational pull on objects within the Roche limit stops them from coalescing. That's why astronomers think the rings are very old, probably as old as the solar system . Now to the lying. Mr. Taylor has a comment about shepherding satellites: But now an exhaustive study of Voyager 2's data from Uranus has shown perfect rings without any "shepherding satellites." WTF? The two confirmed shepherding satellites of Uranus, Ophelia and Cordelia , were discovered by Voyager 2 . If only your attention to detail were as exhaustive. Not only that, Mr. Taylor's idea seems to come primarily from a letter to the editor in Science News (2), which cites the existence of the two shepherding moons . I think Ian needs a fire extinguisher for his pants. Image via Wikimedia Commons (1) Unless Mr. Taylor was prescient and excluded Pluto. But then he would be including Mars in the five outer planets, and Mars doesn't have rings either. (2) Sorry, that link just shows the table of contents, but a complete copy of the letter is below: A number of researchers have suggested that the rings of Uranus -- compared with the solar system, which has been around for some 4.6 billion years -- look relatively young, perhaps less than a billion years old. But scientists are traditionally suspicious of explanations whose validity depends on observations made exactly at some key moment. How likely is it that the Voyager 2 spacecraft just happened to be around to photograph the rings during the short span when they existed? An alternative theory from Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado at Boulder suggests the rings may not be young at all. Instead, he proposes, their chunks keep grinding against one another in a way that continually creates new particles. Without some such regenerative process to sustain them, Esposito notes, the Uranian rings as Voyager 2 saw them would be gone in a billion years or less. Indeed, many of the particles are so small that they would be dragged down to destruction in that time by the planet's extended hydrogen atmosphere. The motions and present locations of two small Uranian moons known as "shepherd" satellites -- believed to be keeping one of the rings as sharp-edged and narrow as it is -- suggest they have been doing so for only about that long. Additional shepherds have been proposed for many of the other nine known Uranian rings, though no one has yet identified any in existing photos. Besides the main rings, Voyager 2's data also showed 50 to 100 tenuous "dust bands" containing smaller particles than the rings. But Esposito says their different positions mean the bands cannot have come from the rings. In a paper submitted to NATURE, he instead proposes that the dust in the bands may have been generated by micrometeoroids colliding with "unseen moonlets," each about 200 meters across, in belts some tens of kilometers wide, as well as by collisions between the moonlets themselves. "Both the moonlet belt objects and the main rings of Uranus have been created by the breakup of larger objects," he says. Any dust or rings that existed billions of years ago would long since have been removed by atmospheric drag, he says, so some mechanism must be creating new dust. In the solar system's early history, according to Esposito, the material that later became the Uranian ring system may have consisted simply of perhaps 10 to 12 moons, each about 200 kilometers across. Since then, the ring system has been in a continuing state of gradual evolution. ~~~~~~~~ By J. Eberhart Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. Especially when they- do stupid shit like this . [Queen Antoinette's] actions irked Assistant Public Defender Maureen Rowland, representing one of Antoinette's co-defendants in a bizarre homicide case that involves the alleged starvation death of a toddler. ...

I have to go vomit now. - allegedly Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. The habenula is a highly conserved structure in the vertebrate central nervous system. It doesn't matter if you look at mammals, reptiles, or fish, we all have it. It seems to be a relay center in communication between the forebrain (in mammals) and a whole host of midbrain structures, including the substantia nigra and raphe nuclei. These are the dopaminergic and serotonergic centers of the brain. So, you can understand why some who study addiction , schizophrenia , and/or depression are turning their attention habenularly (and if you don't understand, follow those links). In fact at least one case study points to deep brain stimulation of the lateral habenula as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression . While all vertebrates have a habenula, they don't all look the same. In addition to showing profound lateralization, the habenula of fish do not seem to separate into medial and lateral nuclei, as they do in mammals. However, just because the gross anatomy is different doesn't mean that connectivity (and function) follows suit. Amo et al. (2010) hypothesized that, because it is such a conserved structure, habenula of the zebrafish would also show subdivisions based on connectivity . This is basically a retrograde/anterograde tracing study. Except instead of using peroxidase based stains they are using awesomely fluorescent compounds. By injecting in the serotonergic centers of the zebrafish, they found retrograde labeling clustered within the ventral habenula; in mammals, similar tracing studies would show labeling in the lateral habenula. It is already known that the zebrafish dorsal habenula (and mammalian medial habenula) sends projections to the interpeduncular nucleus. So it seems that the medial/lateral subdivision in mammals corresponds to a dorsal/ventral subdivision in zebrafish. They also did an anterograde tracer to confirm this connection. Plus, as further confirmation, in mammals the descending projections from the medial habenula form the core of the fasciculus retroflexus while the projections from the lateral habenula form the sheath. Do the projections from the dorsal and ventral habenula of the zebrafish follow such a pattern? I wouldn't be mentioning it if they didn't. The green is GFP expressed in the dorsal habenula neurons while the navy blue is neurobiotin taken up retrogradely by ventral habenular neurons. Neat stuff. So now we know that the habenula of mammals and fish are homologous. Why is this important? One, transgenic studies in mammals are kind of messy. Sure, there is lots of work being done on mice, but the availability of other transgenic mammals is limited. By contrast, zebrafish may offer an alternative means of studying the functionality of
habenular output through genetic manipulation (1). Two, by identifying genes specific to the two habenular subdivisions, the authors were able to look at the development of the habenula in zebrafish. Turns out that the fish really do have a medial and lateral subdivision, the lateral division just migrates to a ventral position during development (2). This makes for a nice picture too. Now, if the ventral habenula has glutamatergic projections that inhibit monoaminergic brain centers, that would really be something.

I know you have a lot to offer, but you must be a vertebrate to go on this ride. (2) I am showing my speciesism, aren't I? It could just as well be that the mammalian ventral habenula fails to migrate to its proper position. Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. A friend guided me to Halloween in the Time of Cholera , a collection of old Halloween photos. It's hard to tell the dates, but they seem to range from late 19th to mid 20th century. I can only imagine this was from the original stage production of Saw . And that wasn't the creepiest one I could have put in here. Not as bad as Victorian death photos , but I would rather spend an hour locked in a closet with that creepy-ass clown from the USPS commercial than look through that photo album again. Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al.
In 1996, in Bob Cringely's documentary Triumph of the Nerds , Steve Jobs said: Picasso had a saying, he said "good artists copy, great artists steal". We have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas. Here's the video : Today, Apple's press release says: “We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We’ve decided to do something about it,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.” Apple has suffered through many patent trolls over the years, and should understand how software patents limit innovation, indeed their consistent position on supporting Open Source Codecs in HTML5 has been that they are afraid of patent lawsuits. So this action can only be seen as an attack on innovation. I wrote a post last year about Twitter theory , and presented on it too so I thought I'd compare how Google Buzz fits in with them or not. Flow Buzz is a flow but it does show an unread count, and it's in your email inbox so the implicit pressure to read is there. You're not cued to dip in and out. Also, all replies come to your main inbox, privileging them over the flow from those you chose to follow. Faces There are faces of people next to the root Buzzes, taping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads, but not by the replies, making those 'comments from strangers' even more alien. Phatic The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at the launch there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine. The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare. Following Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your Buzz in gmail and Google Profile pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in Google Contacts , but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups. The overall effect makes it feel more like a Mornington Crescent server than Twitter. I made a Mornington Crescent Buzz account; it seems to fit. Publics Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. The subtlety is that the publics are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return. Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The tragedy of the comments ensues, where annoying people can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow. This is the YouTube comments problem yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays. Mutual media By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the listening Web to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way. If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work. Small world networks Social connections are a small-world network locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse model of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed. Buzz's promise is that it builds on Activity Streams and other open standards , so it could help encourage others to do this better. Mike Arrington wrote a plea for better social software on Sunday: The online social landscape today sort of feels to me like search did in 1999. It’s a mess, but we don’t complain much about it because we don’t know there’s a better way. Everything is decentralized, and no one is working to centralize stuff. I’ve got photos on Flickr, Posterous and Facebook (and even a few on MySpace), reviews on Yelp (but movie reviews on Flixster), location on Foursquare, Loopt and Gowalla, status updates on Facebook and Twitter, and videos on YouTube. Etc. I’ve got dozens of social graphs on dozens of sites, and trying to remember which friends puts his or her pictures on which site is a huge challenge. What enabled Google to solve the search problem was a common standard for expressing pages and the links between them, so that they could index the webpages and derive a metric for which ones were more important. They didn't do this by replacing the web with a structured database that they curated, they worked with the standards in use to make sense of it. To solve the social conundrum we need the equivalent - agreed standards in widespread use so that we can generalize across sites. Fortunately, we have these. We have OpenID and OAuth for delegated login; we have XFN , other microformats and Portable Contacts for public and private people connections; we have Feeds and Activity Streams for translating social actions between sites. This enabling social infrastructure means that we'll be able to have a new generation of sites that enhance our web experience through social filtering without our connections being centralised in a single company's database. Once we get used to the experience of being able to delegate login, personal connections and activity updates, we'll look askance at developers who insist we create yet another profile and invite all our friends by email to experience their site; it'll be like a website without links. What I wanted from the iPad —a very high-pixel-density HD screen in a small device—didn't happen. But in the commentary of my techie colleagues like David , Alex and Tim , I'm seeing another disappointment. They're saying 'this isn't a computer like I grew up with'. It's not the generative machine that can be bent to our will to do anything, it's a display device. Now this is true, but it reminds me of programmers complaining about the Web, as opposed to native applications. The Web is something that started out as a display medium, but is now the platform we all expect to build our applications on, precisely because it is an abstraction that comes between us and the particular hardware our users are running. The web is an agreement on how to phrase things. The iPad picks up this agreement and delivers on it in a new form, but exceptionally well. When the iPhone was launched, I said that the web was the one standard even Steve Jobs can't ignore . This is reinforced by the iPad - it opens with web browsing, and the Book format adopted, ePub, is built on HTML. I would prefer it if anyone could distribute native apps for the iPad, but we all can create websites. The big difference the iPhone brought, and that the iPad builds on is the pervasive ability to zoom in and out easily. I think that this will lead to a change in how we think about user experience, with the deep zooming experience we are familar with from Google Maps and now Prezi becoming natural in more and more apps. The chaps at Mozilla, Christopher Blizzard and Robert O'Callahan reopened the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; debate yesterday, with a spirited defence of their decision to support only the patent-unencumbered - Ogg format and Vorbis and Theora codecs in Firefox releases as part of their HTML5 support. Now, I understand their motives here - back when I was at Apple, I spent a big chunk of time trying get permission to add support for Vorbis to QuickTime, but didn't manage to get it past Apple management's fears. However, all the browsers I use now claim to support HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; , so I thought I'd try it out. I made some simple test pages using mp3, .au and WAV files, to see how they were supported. What I found was a bit disappointing - it seems that the way that the spec is written, you can support &lt;audio&gt; but no file formats or codecs at all (my Droid does this), and if you can't play the file you're not supposed to show the fallback HTML contents This means that Firefox, Droid won't show the link to the audio file below: Looking Up From Dystopia though browsers that don't support &lt;audio&gt; at all will. Here's the markup: &lt;audio src="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" controls&gt;&lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kevinmarks/dystopia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt; Looking Up From Dystopia &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; However, if I use a direct link or an embedded &lt;iframe&gt; , Firefox will use available plugins to play the file (both Flash and QuickTime happily play mp3's). Thus using &lt;audio&gt; give me less compatibility with current browsers. On phone browsers, odder things happen - iPhone gives a clickable button for the &lt;audio&gt; , but auto-loads an &lt;iframe&gt; ; Droid ignroes iFrames, Palm Pre doesn't have &lt;audio&gt; but &lt;iframe&gt; behaves like the iPhone. Smarter behaviour with declarative audio would be nice here. -Submarine patent trolls keeping periscopes down may exist. Kevin Marks Originally uploaded by O'Reilly Conferences Last week at Web2expo I gave a 10-minute keynote on the new vocabulary needed to understand where the web is going - most of this comes from sociology and anthropology. If you've been following my blog, you'll recognise this inculdes ideas from my Twitter in Theory post, from the Flow Past Web , from one on Digital Publics and of course from the Tummler post. Here's the video: And here's the presentation, which uses Prezi 's mindmap-as-presentation software: This weekend, Adam Penenberg wrote a post at Techcrunch Let’s Kill “Viral”: It’s Time For a New Word in which, after being ridiculed by radio hosts over the title of his book 'The Viral Loop' he says: The problem, I think, is the word “viral,” which comes from biology and was retrofitted to cover the phenomenon of word-of-mouth—or on the Web, so-called “word-of-mouse”—dissemination of ideas. I propose we kill it and replace it with something better. Now this is a topic I've spoken and written about before, but I think Adam is missing the point again. As I said then, if you behave like a disease, people develop an immune system. I don't think changing the name is enough - we need to change practice too. Viruses are exploitative - they hijack normal reproduction to propagate their genes at the expense of the host. This is an accurate metaphor for the kinds of scammy social applications that Mike Arrington described in his Scamville: The Social Gaming Ecosystem Of Hell post this weekend, aimed at the same app developers I was talking to originally in 2008 . When I read Adam's interview with Caterina Fake it was obvious that Caterina's expert Tummling was key to Flickr's growth, and it didn't fit Adam's 'Viral' framing. Caterina says: But a game built for adults, where communication could come more freely, would mean the social interactions would be much more fruitful . They also have this exchange: Penenberg : There's both a good and bad side to virality. Products with viral hooks that are so strong they coerce people to sign up--in order to achieve a huge initial viral rush--are obviously bad. Not only do they alienate users, they don't lead to a sustainable business. On the good side, you have organic growth, which comes as a natural byproduct of something that spreads simply because people like it--eBay, Hot or Not, and Flickr. I can't think of an antonym for it. Fake : How about brute force growth? Penenberg : That's good. Maybe we should trademark the term. Clearly Adam is struggling with his stale metaphor here, trying to come up with better terminiology. When I mentioned this on twitter, Caterina responded with Things on the internet grow fungally, not virally. The metaphor is completely wrong. and I was a former member of the SF Mycological Society. Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of mycelia, underground... Which fits perfectly with my organic reproduction metaphors. So lets keep the term 'viral' for explotatative applications that violate trust to reproduce against the interests of their hosts, and we can use organic terms like 'fruitful', or if we insist on alliterative euphony, 'virile videos', 'fertile films' and maybe even 'philoprogenitive photographs'. Almost 800 years ago in 1215, a group of Barons pinned King John down and got a written list of rights, some of which are still British Law. This week, by contrast, Baron Mandelson plans to revoke rights by government fiat. Lets compare. Magna Carta : (20) For a trivial offence, a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence, and for a serious offence correspondingly, but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood. In the same way, a merchant shall be spared his merchandise, and a villein the implements of his husbandry, if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court. None of these fines shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood. (38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it. (39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. (40) To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice. (61)[...]We will not seek to procure from anyone, either by our own efforts or those of a third party, anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished. Should such a thing be procured, it shall be null and void and we will at no time make use of it, either ourselves or through a third party. The Digital Economy Bill is not so clearly written, but: (1) This section applies if it appears to a copyright owner that— (a) a subscriber to an internet access service has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service; or (b) a subscriber to an internet access service has allowed another person to use the service, and that other person has infringed the owner’s copyright by means of the service. (2) The owner may make a copyright infringement report to the internet service provider who provided the internet access service if a code in force under section 124C or 124D (an “initial obligations code”) allows the owner to do so. Which sounds like it's 'own unsupported statement, without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it' to me. 124H Obligations to limit internet access (1) The Secretary of State may at any time by order impose a technical obligation on internet service providers if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate in view of— (a) an assessment carried out or steps taken by OFCOM under section 124G; or (b) any other consideration. Not 'lawful judgement of h
s equals or by the law of the land' or 'proportional' or 'assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood', just 'any other consideration' the Secretary of State feels like. 302A Power to amend Part 1 and this Part (1) The Secretary of State may by order amend Part 1 or this Part for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet, if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur. [...] (5) The power may be exercised so as to— (a) confer a power or right or impose a duty on any person; (b) modify or remove a power, right or duty of any person; (c) require a person to pay fees. Again, the Secretary of State can make anyone do anything, or pay anything, without due process, preserving livelihood, lawful judgment. It's the exact opposite of the 'anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished' being 'null and void and we will at no time make use of it' clause. I'm not a lawyer, but I'll take the drafting of Geoffrey de Mandeville and the other 24 Barons from 1215 over Peter Mandelson and Sion Simon. For a thorough legal discussion, read Lillian Edwards post , then sign the petition and join the Open Rights Group .
3lb loss! In the past 5 years I think I've only twice ever lost 3lbs in one week, so this was a bit of a surprise. But I have been on track and then some, this week. Last Thursday I went to see a Nutritionist who, after looking through the detailed questionnaire I'd filled out and testing me on her machine, told me I most likely had a couple of mild food intolerances and too much yeast in my system which affects my digestion and ability to absorb the right nutrients, thus either causing, or contributing to my CFS. The upshot of this is it has been recommended I cut out sugars, yeast and fungi from my diet - this includes fruit juice, dried fruits and many fresh fruits too, as they are all high in sugar content - and take pro-biotics and Chromium supplements to allow my body to recover. She didn't think I had full blown Candida, but felt I was leaning that way so should look to address it. I don't appear to have a wheat intolerance, but can't have bread because of the yeast. And it turns out the fungi thing means I can't have Quorn either, which is a bit of a bugger as we lead a largely vegetarian diet and Quorn usually features once or twice a week. It seems mostly I'll be following a GL diet, which Maggie had been looking at anyway. Am I certain this is all correct and not bullshit? No. You don't need a medical degree to call yourself a nutritionist, and the vega machine she used to test me for my reactions to different food stuffs hasn't had full clinical trials. However, I'm prepared to give it a go. It looks a few stages more advanced than Crystal Therapy, and I'm not being recommended to do anything unhealthy or life threatening. If it turns out to be complete bollocks, then at least I won't have lost anything. What this has meant is I now daren't snack on anything I shouldn't. It's no longer just a case of extra calories delaying or preventing weight loss, but the wrong things can feed the yeast growth. And if I'm to give this a shot then I've got to do it properly, otherwise I'll never know. I've not given up my 2 coffees a day yet, but I fear it's only a matter of time... Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 1.4lb - 183.4lbs Body fat: 25.5% Total Weight Loss: 91.6lbs 1lb loss! That's good. Was on track all week, with the exception of a tub of popcorn at the cinema on Saturday when Maggie and I went to see the new Alice in Wonderland movie (visually lovely, but lacking any real dramatic tension). No matter how many advances I've made in other areas of my life, I cannot go to the cinema without having a tub of popcorn. I would be completely unable to enjoy the film, spending the entire time missing the popcorn. Fortunately we very rarely go to the cinema Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4.4lb - 186.4lbs Body fat: 26.1% Total Weight Loss: 88.6lbs &nbsp;0.4lb loss Back in the right direction again. Forgot to mention last week it was the 5th Anniversary since I began the journey of heathly eating. I still haven't figured out whether that's a good or a bad thing... Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.4lb - 187.4lbs Body fat: 25.6% Total Weight Loss: 87.6lbs 1.8lb gain To be honest, that could have been worse. This past week has seen my daughter's birthday celebrations, a trip to see my stepdaughter and her children and a weekend away with my wife, including trips to cafes. I'm actually craving vegetables. Well, nearly... Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.8lb - 187.8lbs Body fat: 25.7% Total Weight Loss: 87.2lbs 0.8lb loss! I'm very pleased with that, although somewhat surprised as there have been a few little extras this week. However, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the greatest achievements in the world of bloggers dealing with health and weight issues has been Kepa, or Fat Lazy Guy , reaching his target of being under 100kg, or 220lbs. What makes this such an astonishing success story is 3 years ago he weighed over 500lbs. And what makes this so special for me is we've been exchanging blog comments since he started. If you like, I knew him back in his days of struggle and massive self-esteem issues, long before the bold and confident guy he is today. So this isn't about some distant person who must be superhuman and I couldn't relate to. This is very real. Here's a wee video he made charting his success . It almost brings a tear to my eye Here's a link to his post Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4lb - 186lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 89lbs 1.4lb loss So my unexpected gain last week must have been a blip as I've dropped down below my weight from 2 weeks ago. I'm happy with that :) Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4.8lb - 186.8lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 88.2lbs 0.8lb gain? Sigh Don't really know what's caused this. I know I did have a couple of little extras this week - a scone on Wednesday, and a cup of hot chocolate on Friday, but these shouldn't have been enough to cause a weight gain. It's not so bad when I can see what I've done wrong, but this is disappointing Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 6.2lb - 188.2lbs Body fat: 26.4% Total Weight Loss: 86.8lbs Another 1.4lb loss! A near faultless week again, but I'm surprised to lose over a pound again. Due to the CFS my activity levels aren't that wonderful, so realistically I don't feel I can expect to lose much over 1/2 a pound per week So I'm happy with that :) Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.4lb - 187.4lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 87.6lbs
Cavum by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling In Kramer and Kiesling's new "Cavum ", the designers offer a new "gamer's game" that reflects the unique sensibilities which have given us games from " Torres " to " Maharaja ". As is typical of this team, they present us with a wide ranging menu of choices each turn and enormous freedom to manage our strategies. For some, this freedom lets players fully manage complex strategies, while for others, the freedom only means confusion and headaches. What is especially interesting is how the designers' style is expressed in a new way - disguised but still unmistakably Kramer and Kiesling. Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling have been working together as co-designers since 1995, but they came to the attention of many gamers with the release of Tikal and Torres in 1999. In both of these games, players had free form turns in which they could choose from a menu of actions - moving, building, exploring, creating new pawns - each of which required the expenditure of some number of "Action Points" which were limited every turn. Tikal was followed by Java in 2000 and Mexica in 2002, and these games are regarded as a trilogy - for their obvious use of this shared system, for the use of masks on their box cover art, and also for the graphic design used in the games by artist Franz Vohwinkel. Depending on how you felt about these games, the "AP" trilogy either referred to "Action Points" or "Analysis Paralysis" because such freedom could lead players to get stuck managing the details of each game turn. With some subsequent games such as "Maharaja", "Australia", "Bison", and even "Sunken City", this system got stretched in different directions, but what remained constant was the use of a menu of potential choices confronting players that allows them to manage their turns with great flexibility. Cavum is a relatively complex tile laying, track building game in which the designers place their stamp in a new way. At the beginning of the "phase", players fill their player mats with the 12 assets shown above. Each represents an action he'll be able to take once. Four of them are ordinary tiles to lay, although each one has a different amount of track (or in this case, "tunnel") One has a piece of track with a big ol' piece of dynamite on it. The three cubes are stations - and these are the only pieces that a player truly owns. They will serve as starting and ending points for paths the player will trace in an effort to claim gems, and they will also block other players' paths. The gray tile with stones on it represents a "vein" which the player may place and "discover" - and will be a source from which all players claim gems. Then there are two wild tiles which may substitute for any of the above, and finally the symbol for prospecting. This will always be the player's last action in the turn, when he traces a path between any two of his stations, crossing through any quantity of tunnels, in an attempt to pass through previously placed veins, and pick up as many gems as possible. Here is where I think the designers really show their true colors. During a phase, a player is going to engage in all twelve of his actions. However, the phase is broken up into any number of turns. During a player turn, he must select between one and four of his actions to perform before passing his turn. So these twelve actions might be distributed among as many as twelve and as few as three player turns per phase. Each phase always culminates in the prospecting action. So one player might choose to rush with his actions, to ensure that gems are still on the board when it's time to prospect. Another might proceed very slowly, forcing all players to take their actions so that he may use all the resources out there when he finally prospects. With such flexibility, it is easy to see why this is very much a gamer's game - and one which can succumb to Analysis Paralysis in the wrong hands. I wonder to what degree Kramer and Kiesling were inspired by Martin Wallace's " Age of Steam ", as they seem to have created a sort of negative image of the Wallace classic. In Age of Steam, players are tracing paths with cities as the end points, running through as many towns as possible. In this case, players own the tracks and the cities are public. In Cavum, things are reversed. The paths are public but the end points - the stations - are what is owned by the players. In Age of Steam, goods begin on cities and get removed as they are used. In Cavum, the goods that are removed appear on the veins - which are the equivalent of Age of Steam's "towns". Age of Steam paths colored for clarity There is an important consequence of having players share all the "track" in Cavum. They need to be interconnected with lots of junctions so that one player can trace from his stations, through various veins, and back to another of his stations, while another player can use much of the same track, use many of the same veins, but return to his own station. In Age of Steam, where players own each piece of track exclusively, the paths don't interconnect as much and tend to be simpler. Can you connect a path between any two blue stations (cubes) that pass through as many gems as possible without passing through any red or yellow stations? Can you do it before other players get impatient? This tangled web is what can make Cavum more than a little brain-burning. What about that dynamite? Each turn a player must place at least one tile with dynamite on it. It is possible to cover up those pieces with normal tunnels in order to delay their destruction, but at the end of the turn, all exposed dynamite tiles get removed - and also take out all top tiles in the six adjacent spaces. In a four player game, it's possible for 28 tiles to go to heaven! Some have characterized this aspect of the game as very nasty. Incredible as it sounds, I don't think this rule is there especially to add a "take that" element to the game, and in my playing it didn't come off as mean. Rather, the board can get so dense and locked in, I think that the designers put in the dynamite in order to insure that the board continues to change after each phase. The game is not that nasty because once a player has created a path, it is difficult to obstruct that path until after he has collected his gems. The dynamite doesn't blow until the very end of the phase. Additionally, although stations block other players' paths, they can't be played on existing track. Even if someone places a track tile in your way, you may be able to promote it by placing another tile on it - as long as the new tile has more connections. The only way I know of to to mess with an existing path is to promote it with a new tile that changes its connections. Note that unlike Age of Steam, all existing connections do not need to be preserved. The way that the designers stray from their Action Point menu and instead specify the particular actions a player must allocate during each phase is a very clever way of directing game play. If this game were from the AP trilogy, it is possible that each action would have had its own cost. A simple tile might cost 2 AP, one with all connections might cost 6 AP, tiles with dynamite could have their own cost, as would stations. The game would have been even more free form, perhaps more strategic, and certainly more maddening. Instead, each player gets a series of 2/3/4/6 branch tiles and they all must be used. Any tile may promote any other tile with fewer branches. There becomes a natural flow and strategy to the phase. Try to start out with the simplest tile possible, and as opponents mess with you, hold back the more complex tiles to play on top and rescue yourself. Or else, use your six early on, secure a complex path - but leave yourself vulnerable if another tile you were relying on gets rerouted. I think that with this method, Kramer and Kiesling have struck a nice balance between freedom and structure in their use of an action menu. Where things seemed to spin out of control was in the paths themselves, which need to be twisty and often difficult to visualize. Indeed, all players tend to be creating paths which all cross over the same terrain, and it seemed difficult to create a master plan that brilliantly snatched lots of gems. Rather, you're more likely to feel like an idiot if you don't get lots of gems. I suspect that experienced players will learn to visualize the board better, make more strategic use of stations, and reduce the apparent chaos. But in my playing, understanding the board was a little like tracking a single strand of spaghetti as it winds its way around the meatballs. If the game were just about laying tunnels and grabbing gems, it wouldn't be a Kramer / Kiesling game. On top of all this, there is a modest economic system to value the gems that you do get. At the beginning of each phase, you can take order tiles. It's exactly what you think. Taking the one pictured is a commitment to acquire and trade a light blue, a dark blue, a green and a red for 26 points. Fail to do so, and you lose 2 points. The risks aren't great, but neither are the rewards because you can still sell gems back to the market - potentially doing even better. In the example here, eight of the yellow gems are either still on the board or in people's hands. A reverse auction is held starting at "8" and going down, and the lowest bidding player could sell as many yellow gems as he owns at his bid price. So there are two ways to collect points for your gems, and which is better will depend on how many players own a given color and how aggressive the bidding gets. The ability to sell gems either to the market or by completing orders struck some of us in our session as a little odd. It watered down the tension. If players must complete orders, then a player has pressure to get the right combination, knowing that not getting the last gem is a big loss of potential points. Such high stakes would provide a natural bomb in the game as it does in Alan Moon's Ticket to Ride . Alternately, forcing players into the market would have created a more economically oriented games in which players must monitor which gems are valuable, jockey for those, and close opponents out of them. By providing both alternatives, players are most likely to go for orders - but relax knowing that the market provides something of a safety net if plans go awry. Perhaps the "all or nothing" game created too much chaos, but this is so obviously a gamer's game, it is surprising to see it made a little more family friendly. I'd love to speak with the designers to learn what they were thinking. I enjoy path laying games and I especially enjoy the complexity that Kramer and Kiesling bring to their best gamer's games. Given the history of such games, I am not convinced that paths laid by Cavum make the most satisfying use of the choices the genre has to offer. The use of actions in the menu in which players may order and group their 12 actions in any way they like - seems to have enormous potential and I hope to see it in a future game. The actual tile and path creation seemed overly involved and counterintuitive. I look forward to future playings to see if I'm able to wrap my brain around this game, or whether the game proves to be the stronger and wraps itself around me. DOMINION by Donald X. Vaccarino If Sylla was a blend of old wines in a new bottle, Dominion is a tasty young wine which seems unlikely to mature greatly. Dominion has become an overnight hit, and so many readers have already played it to death since its recent release. I've played it only once, but what stands out about it is its originality despite its simplicity. The goal is to collect the most and best victory point cards into your deck. Each player has his own deck of ten cards - seven with (1) gold and three with (1) VP. He draws five cards from his deck and can use the gold cards to buy either more gold, more VP's or any one of ten special power cards ("kingdom cards") which are arranged in a display. Cards so purchased are placed into his deck for future draws. After the player has used a power from one of his special cards and purchased a card using his gold, then both used and unused cards from his hand are placed in his discard pile - to be recycled when his draw deck has been used up. In this way, players are consistently drawing five cards, taking actions, buying new cards, and then drawing more. Cards used - or not - are continually being recycled, but at a slower pace as his deck grows in size. When sufficient cards have been purchased, the game ends and the player with the most points in VP cards wins. This feature of continually drawing and renewing one's own deck, and building that deck on the fly is very original and the game plays like no other Eurogame. Because a player must, as a default, draw exactly five cards a turn and work with only those cards at any given time, the game requires a player not to maximize his assets with the most extensive display of powers possible. Instead, the game is about concentration. How can a player build a deck such that a random assortment of any five cards at a time be most powerful most consistently? What we see is that the cost of adding gold cards to his hand is disproportionately high with higher values of gold. Gold ca rds valued at (1) have no cost; those valued at (2) cost three, and those valued at (3) cost six. This seems counterintuitive until you realize that normally a deck consisting of all (1) value gold cards could never buy anything costing more than five (and then only rarely), while a deck of (3) value gold cards can much more easily accumulate brawny values used to purchase big VP cards or strong powers. In any given game, there are ten different kingdom cards to choose from, but the game comes with 25 unique decks, so that the smorgasboard of choices may be different with each game. Examples of powers in the set I used were ones that gave players extra actions and/or extra opportunities to buy cards. There were powers which allowed a player to add three cards into his hand (remember, they all recycle, so this is an alternative way of concentrating your hand), and ones which permitted gold cards to be upgraded to the next higher level. Player interaction is very limited and from what I saw came in two forms. One is that there are a few cards which enable a player to "attack" others, for example by forcing them to discard down to three cards, and other cards which enabled players to defend against such attacks. In my game, these were used sparingly because they don't really help you advance your agenda, and even a defensive card needs to "just happen to be" in your hand at the time of an attack for it to do any good. The other form of player interaction concerns the pace of the game. A strategy which relies on gradually building up a killer hand and then collecting VP's can be counteracted by a strategy which attempts to buy lots of cheap cards and end the game quickly. In practice, I don't believe that players gain from building up large decks because their powers are not cumulative. You're still drawing only five cards at a time. The value of a large powerful deck is that it is less diluted by VP cards. But an opponent cannot surprise you by ending the game. If other players switch into "collecting VP cards" mode, you can shift gears quickly. Certainly, the dynamic deck building of Dominion is original. Adding to the freshness of the game is the way that 25 distinct decks of kingdom cards can be mixed and matched to create unique situations for the players. However, many players have compared this game with Tom Lehmann's " Race for the Galaxy "- with many fans stating their preference for the latter. If Dominion is unique - is the comparison reasonable? Looking at the ways that each game works sheds some light on what makes each game special - and also how very different mechanisms can be brothers under the skin. Like "Race for the Galaxy" and its predecessor " San Juan " by Andreas Seyfarth, Dominion is an economic game based entirely in cards. Each player collects cards which enable him to buy yet other cards, which add to a player's collection, giving him new powers and more victory points. One glaring difference wh
ch drives different approaches in each game is that in Race for the Galaxy, players are purchasing cards for a permanent display in front of them, while in Dominion, purchased cards simply enter a player's deck. The Race for the Galaxy player has assets which are continually growing, as each purchased card accumulates powers on top of those already present. Every new asset is a good thing. In Dominion, only a few cards are operating at any one time, and then they are quickly recycled and the player moves on to another set. It's good to have lots of kingdom cards because a hand dominated by VP's can't purchase anything new. It is also possible to select a variety of cards which are likely to interact in productive ways when they show up together. But the effectiveness of any deck is going to max out quickly as the best you can do is to get a handful of productive interactions and then move on to the next draw. Dominion requires a new kind of thinking - one in which more isn't always better. In Dominion, players begin the game by selecting ten different decks of power cards and those become the fixed choices throughout the game. In Race for the Galaxy, there is a single deck used in all games, but players must make choices from the cards they randomly draw throughout the game. The argument for replayability in Dominion is that with ten out of twenty five possible cards being used in a game, there are 3.3 million different possible combination. In Race for the Galaxy, there's only one. Yet Dominion has a hidden weakness. It lacks sufficient ability to surprise the players and force them to react to unanticipated challenges and opportunities. When a game forces a player to keep on his toes and potentially change his strategy substantially, I call it a Nervous System . In Dominion, the experienced player can survey the available cards, map out his strategy, and execute it. The degree to which cards interact in his hand will force tactical decisions, but not generally a rethinking of the plan. In comparison, Race for the Galaxy has only about 100 cards, but they are all (or nearly all) different, and their appearance at any time is entirely unpredictable. A player can set off down a particular path... and discover opportunities in his cards which tickle him into straying down a new path. Furthermore, because the player's actions depend both on his own choices and those of his opponents, he may find himself with unexpected opportunities to exploit. Dominion is a sufficiently short game that it isn't crippled by the lack of surprise. You can lay out a set of ten cards to start with - and for the next thirty minutes, maybe that's all the surprise you need. But it is a limitation that's in the game's structure. Like a mechanical dog which has dozens of interchangable parts, there is lots of potential variety, but after a while I suspect that players may find that underneath it all, it still always barks to the same cues. Time will tell. It's been a long time since I've contributed to this Journal; the last article appeared over six months ago. That's just wrong. I have been working on an article - about the "Frustration Factor" in games. However, work and writer's anxiety have been pushing it out and out and... It's a tricky thing to create an article about types of game mechanisms because the subject is so vague. Worse, any given topic seems to be so br oad that I keep writing when I ought to just wrap it up. So in an effort to get the train moving again, I'm offering a sort of article that I've specifically avoided in the past. Game reviews. OK - This is not your father's game review. It's not even Schloesser or Vasel's game review. It's a game review JBD style. 1) The focus is on the game mechanics. Expect little or no discussion about the theme or components. 2) Game mechanics are described in their most essential form. There will be no rehash of all the rules, but instead a focus on the handful of mechanisms that drive the game and the decisions they offer. 3) I may provide only a passing mention of whether I think the game is good. Don't expect a buyer's guide. More emphasis will be placed on what mechanics are innovative or effective and why. In most cases I only had a chance to play the game once. One reason I've avoided writing reviews in the past is that there are so many of them out there already. Tossing another one onto the net seems redundant. However, I had the good fortune to attend BoardGameGeek.con and had a chance to play many new games which I know there's lots of curiosity about. I'm going to limit each post to a single review. This will hopefully make it easier for people searching for information about a given game to find it, and will also keep each post to a manageable length. My hope is to publish a new review every three or four days. Here goes.... SYLLA by Dominque Ehrhard Ehrhard used to be a considerable force in Eurogame design, but he hasn’t been on the gamer’s game radar for a while. When they came out, I had great enthusiasm for both Condottiere and Serenissima , but those are over ten years old. Sylla is released by Ystari, and it has their fingerpri nts all over it. It appeals to gamers, and has oodles of features that feel familiar – competing auctions, income generating tokens, food shortages- and it offers situations where scarce resources must be carefully allocated among competing needs. The driving mechanism is that players each start with several character cards, and will get to add another to their hand in each game turn. Each character has one to three colored symbols (red/blue/yellow) and potentially an additional special power. After adding a n ew character at the beginning of each game turn, players may use thes e in any of several auctions for tiles which grant benefits. Each auction is color coded, so a character with a red symbol m ay only be used in a “red” auction, while a character with all three may be used in any of them (but may only be “spent” once) – the three c olors make him three times more flexible but not three times more valuable. Among the other assets that players take – each turn and also potentially from winning auctions – are disks in any of three colors. These disks will have varying values at the end of the game. Players also earn money every game turn and also take income from certain tiles and from one of the characters. The most original phase comes in the election to suppress bad events. Four events are dealt out, and two of them will occur each turn. Now, unspent cards with the appropriate special power (the soldier in the upper left, and the rather matriarchal looking "vestal virgin" in the upper right) may contribute to influence these events. (The first event card, on the right, may receive votes from both soldiers and Virgins, the one below it only accepts votes from Virgins. The two events receiving the fewest suppressing votes are the ones that occur, and these may cause the values of certain chips to drop, or may cause a certain type of character card to become out of play for several turns. Finally, players may convert money into VP’s. Sometimes this is through an auction and sometimes at a fixed price. From the description you’ll see that there is nothing glaringly innovative here. There are auctions in multiple “currencies”. The auction to control events is similar to that found in Rieneck and Stadler's " Cuba ". In Cuba though, a single player selects the “laws” while in Sylla the votes are aggregated among players. The varying values of the colored chips is similarly a commonly found market mechanism. In spite of this, I found Sylla to be greater than the sum of its parts. There are A LOT of mechanisms in play each game turn, but all are reasonably familiar so the game is easy to learn. One aspect of the game I appreciated is the fact that a given character typically can either be spent in the auction for tiles OR provide income OR be applied to a subsequent voting process. So many different sorts of needs are competing for the attention of your very limited resources. Since the special powers differ from card to card, the selection of characters becomes a strategic consideration. It is not the same as having a bunch of money and many places tospend it. Every card has only select places where it can be used. An urgent need to come up with another red dot may force you to spend a card you were hoping to hold back – for yet another urgent need. Example of six tiles up for auction in a given turn. Note that the first two only accept "red" cards, the next two only "yellow" and the last only "blue". The winner of each auction chooses the tile to auction next. Sylla's variety of character types and colors, its pricing mechanisms for colored discs, and its multiple distinct phases create plenty of opportunities to let players try out different strategies. Does one concentrate in order to maintain strength, or diversify in order to have flexibility? If you focus on earning lots of tiles, you may earn many discs - but if you ignore the events, then other players may drive the value of your discs way down. Another strategic decision lies in how many of your characters should be "Christian" as symbolized by the fish symbol. At the end game, all Christian cards gain bonus VP's. The down side is that certain events can cause your Christians to remain out of play for one or more game turns. An over reliance on such cards can cripple your play indefinitely. There are also good situational issues that arise. You might expect to win a valuable tile by committing two cards. If forced to bid three, do you commit a card that you wanted to use in the event phase? Every game turn has seven phases with perhaps ten individual auctions, but the game doesn't come off as a repetitive auction fest. For one, the types of things being auctioned tend to vary throughout the turn, and so do the m ethods used. The auction for tiles is a traditional sequential auction, while the bid to control events is more of a majority control type of play. Additionally, the various "currencies" are in short supply, so auctions don't overstay their welcome. Players might have at most four red cards to compete in a red tile auction, and all assets are public. The auction plays out tactically. Do I want to commit everything to guarantee getting what I want - or do I hold back a smidgen to at least drive the price up and maybe get a bargain? Each auction is over quickly and there is little downtime. I enjoyed my one play of Sylla. The play was certainly very familiar, but while the game may have lacked focus, the variety of arenas to compete in kept the game changing and engaging. Players who have appreciated the rock solid reliability and Euro-ishness of other Ystari games such as Amyitis and Caylus are likely to welcome another recognizable member of the family. Printer friendly "So what is this game about?" is the natural first question you might ask when someone brings out a new board game for you to try. That question can have one of two answers, depending on the angle you look at the game from: theme or mechanics. "The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history. You goal is to influence Pharoahs, build monuments, farm on the Nile, and advance the culture of the people in an attempt to appease the god of the Sun." "Okay, but what is the game about?" "It is a set collecting and auction game. There is a wide variety of tiles that you'll collect, which combine in myriad ways to score points. On your turn, you'll decide whether to add one more tile to the pool, or to auction off the ones already there. Your goal is to collect those tiles which will be most valuable to you, prevent your opponents from getting too many tiles valuable to them. " Either of the above is a reasonable description of Reiner Knizia's " Ra ". Since this is the Journal of Boardgame Design, I'm interested almost 100% in the latter. Either description could reasonably be called the game's "theme", but in practice "theme" has come to mean the historical context in which the game supposedly takes place. The designer drapes a bunch of mechanisms around the theme, and he has a game. Maybe the mechanisms are closely tied to the theme and often, in Eurogames, they aren't. A game, at its best, is more than a bunch of mechanisms. It is a coherent system of mechanisms with a theme of its own. Let's call this theme that summarizes the system of mechanisms the game concept . There is nothing to prevent a game built from a bunch of connected mechanisms from being lots of fun, but I think that having a strong game concept takes the game up a level. It helps to focus the players' goals. It adds meaning to the game apart from the theme. It defines the game. "Players choose among a series of actions which help them to score points, gain resources, or avoid catastrophes. The more you are able to take the same action during the game, the more valuable it becomes. The trick is that in each turn, a player is presented with three possible actions, and he must decide which one to play, and which ones to make available to the players to his left." - Notre Dame I enjoy explaining game rules, and I always introduce the game by first describing the game concept. Every rule has a role in supporting the game concept. If players can wrap the whole idea of the game around their heads, then all the individual rules ought make sense. Players can sit down and get to work at trying to win. If they can't get the game concept, then most likely you'll see the "deer in the headlights" look. "Okay, you explained the game to me but... what am I supposed to do?" The issue of game concept surfaced when I recently first played " Amyitis " by Cyril Demaegd . On any given turn, a player will take one of five different actions. The Merchant and Peasant each give you distinct types of resources. The Engineer gives you immediate points and a shot at a majority battle, for more points, on the main part of the board. The Priest lets you take part in a different majority battle in a small part of the board, which help you win more points or resources depending on where you choose to play. Finally you may move the caravan - in which you spend the resources you earned elsewhere to earn: points from cards, income, faster caravan movement, or the ability to earn points on the main board, which in turn is limited by choices made by players who chose the Engineer earlier in the game. Deep breath. So the game Amyitis is about... I'm not sure. Cyril Demaegd has a defense of the structure of Amyitis which is worth reading. He described it as having a "star structure" rather than a "line structure". I think I understand his point. Some games, ones with a linear structure, have their elements lined up like dominoes. The first one effects the next one, and so on down, until the last mechanism which affects the victory conditions. " Power Grid " by Friedmann Friese is an example of this. You buy power plants, which give you capacity to use fuel. You buy fuel that fills your plants, and together they can power your cities. You extend your network of cities, which when powered give you victory points, as well as income that feeds the entire cycle for the next game turn. What I think is meant by a "star structure" might correspond to what Americans call a "wagon wheel" or "hub and spoke" structure. There is a core mechanism and several secondary mechanisms. The secondary mechanisms may be independent, but they all affect the core mechanism. The problem is that there is no core mechanism in Amyitis. The garden, which does take up the most physical space on the game board, really turns out to be just another way of scoring points that is not obviously more important than any other. Here's my picture of the Amyitis structure, which looks more like the floor plan from a spy movie than a wagon wheel. From all this, it may come as a surprise when I say that I think Amyitis is a hell of a lot of fun. There are some very clever mechanisms in the game, and notwithstanding the nightmare diagram above, the interrelationships play well. However, playing Amyitis is a little like playing with sand. It can be lots of fun, but there is nothing to hold on to. A strong game concept doesn't make a game good. It makes

Today, a gentleman named John left a comment on the Solovki &nbsp;post. &nbsp;The comment said: Absolutely beautiful&nbsp; picture . I'd love to go and see other countries and their cultures. This seemingly-innocuous sentence is actually a little trap — when you click on the word "picture", it takes you to John's gardening blog. &nbsp;Why does John want you to go to his blog? &nbsp;To create a possibility of you clicking on an ad, so John can make some passive income. &nbsp;He also gets a little boost from the search engines by having a one-way link from a hugely popular resource (proof: google "terry gross x ira glass" ). I wouldn't have minded if John simply left a URL. &nbsp;It's the trickery that basically makes me feel like I'm letting a total scumbag crash on my couch, possibly forever. I don't want to moderate comments, it just seems to kind of defeat the purpose of the internet. So I decided to disable links in comments. &nbsp;Well, you can't — Blogger doesn't have such an option. It's really not that hard though, it's not like comments are graffiti — it's just HTML. So I added some special magic codes to replace an anchor tag with its text. I figure if a commenter's intentions are pure, he'll probably leave an actual URL, in which case the reader will have to select the link and paste it into a new tab's navigation bar. &nbsp;Commenters with impure intentions — ones that try to trick my readers into clicking ads on their gardening blogs — will leave us with possible non sequiturs. &nbsp;In John's case, the special magic codes simply turn him into an extra super-nice internet guy.

TreeHugger has a post on the expanding popularity of survivalist culture in the US - Survivalism is the New Black . Survivalism used to be the preserve of wingnuts who believed in black helicopters and the New World Order; now it has gone positively mainstream. John wrote previously about Survivalist Green; Now the New York Times picks up the story. Cormac McCarthy's The Road and Will Smith in I am Legend have described it, while climate change, peak oil and Katrina are making a much broader spectrum of society prepare for it. Writing in the Times, Alex Williams quotes Barton M. Biggs, the former chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley: People should “assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure.Your safe haven must be self-sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food,” It should be well-stocked with seed, fertilizer, canned food, wine, medicine, clothes, etc. Think Swiss Family Robinson. Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down.” Most surprising survivalist in the article: Alex Steffen of Worldchanging: One left-of-center environmentalist who is taking action is Alex Steffen, the executive editor of www.Worldchanging.com, a Web site devoted to sustainability. With only slight irony, Mr. Steffen, 40, said he and his girlfriend could serve as “poster children for the well-adjusted, urban liberal survivalist,” given that they keep a six-week cache of food and supplies in his basement in Seattle (although they polished off their bottle of doomsday whiskey at a party). He said the chaos following Hurricane Katrina served as a wake-up call for him and others that the government might not be able to protect them in an emergency or environmental crisis. “The ‘where do we land when climate change gets crazy?’ question seems to be an increasingly common one,” said Mr. Steffen in an e-mail message, adding that such questions have “really gone mainstream.” <!-- Technology Review has an article on smarter electric vehicles charges, claiming "the devices could help stabilize the grid, and make charging electric cars cheaper" - Smarter Chargers for Electric Vehicles . This spring, GE will start selling a line of "smart charging stations," devices that communicate with utilities to optimize charging, for electric vehicles. The technology could be key to ensuring that electric cars don't strain the power grid, and it could cut down on consumer electricity bills. Eventually, because the charging stations could help stabilize the grid, they could allow utilities to rely more on intermittent renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power. The GE products come as automakers introduce a new wave of electric vehicles. GM, Nissan and Ford, for example, plan to start selling electric vehicles this year, and others will follow. While other companies already offer electric vehicle chargers, GE's products could be important because they're made to work with the rest of the company's "smart grid" infrastructure, which stretches from the power plant, through the grid, all the way to smart appliances in the home. The company also has close relationships to utilities, which could speed adoption. Electric cars could eventually have a big impact on electricity use--charging a plug-in vehicle would account for about 30 percent of a typical household's electricity bill, says Michael Kintner-Meyer, a senior research scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA. (He helped develop a smart charger for electric vehicles, which PNNL has made available for licensing.) If too many people decide to charge their cars during times of peak electricity use, it could force utilities to use expensive and often dirty "peaking" power plants to meet demand, or even threaten power outages. Smart chargers could solve this problem. At the simplest level, GE's chargers would let owners program their cars to delay charging until the middle of the night, when demand is low. As more utilities start to use "time-of-day pricing," when they'd charge less for electricity in the middle of the night, for example, this feature could save customers money. But the chargers can also respond to real-time price signals sent by utilities to GE's smart meters, which are now being installed in some homes. These signals would trigger changes in charging, making it possible for electric vehicles to serve as a buffer, smoothing out variations in supply and demand. <!-- The Age has an article on cogeneration / fuel cell company Ceramic Fuel Cells (an area attracting much attention in the wake of the unveiling of the Bloom Box ) - Fuel cells a tough sell in a coal-fired economy . IF YOU are flicking on a light switch in Melbourne today, there is a 96 per cent chance you are buying electricity generated more than 100 kilometres away, beneath a Latrobe Valley smokestack. It is a cheap way to set up an electricity system, but hugely inefficient. An estimated 75 per cent of the energy generated at Hazelwood and Yallourn is lost as heat or used onsite. Another 5 per cent is lost during transmission and distribution. It means only about 20 per cent of the energy ends up making the distance. The electrons firing your bulb are also environmentally unfriendly, coming from decades-old technology that burns brown coal, the most greenhouse gas intensive major power source. The replacement for this ''dirty'' power in coming years may not be what most expect - initially large-scale gas plants supplemented by wind farms, with solar thermal and geothermal hopefully to follow. It could also come from a box about the size of a small washing machine that sits down the side of your house. This, at least, is the line of Ceramic Fuel Cells, the company behind the solid oxide fuel cell technology known as BlueGen. Based in Noble Park, it is said to produce enough power in a year to run a standard home more than twice over. BlueGen creates electricity and heat by passing natural gas over ceramic fuel cells. According to Ceramic Fuel Cells managing director Brendan Dow it is 85 per cent efficient and cuts the average home's annual carbon dioxide emissions by 18 tonnes. ''At the moment they are about $25,000 to $30,000 installed but I predict within the next three to four years they should be $10,000,'' Dow says. ''But this is misleading, really. They will be like a mobile phone, where you don't pay for the handset, you just pay for the contract. Here, you won't pay for the BlueGen unit, just for the gas.'' It is a big call. Just 30 BlueGen units have been sold to date - and just four in Australia. The majority of sales have been in Germany, which is better prepared for decentralised electricity generation after years of the government generously promoting rooftop solar photovoltaic panels. But Ceramic Fuel Cells is now approaching an important turning point. It expects safety approval by a Netherlands rating agency in the next three weeks, making large-scale installation much easier. It has signed deals with a handful of European companies, opened a manufacturing plant near Dusseldorf and employs 80 people in Melbourne. Premier John Brumby opened the Noble Park plant last May, and has been vocally supportive. Dow spruiks a bright future: "We will be cash-flow positive by next year. We're only planning on selling a couple of hundred this year, but the plan is to sell up to a couple of thousand next year." The question Ceramic Fuel Cells poses for policy makers is: does an innovative low-emissions technology that emits less carbon dioxide than brown coal deserve public help to become cost-effective? In the US, fuel cells are the flavour of the month thanks to some heavyweight support for a silicon fuel cell known as the "Bloom Box". Launched last month by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it boasts Google as its first customer and has been backed by eBay, Wal-Mart and Coc-Cola. The rhetoric at the US launch was expansive. Schwarzenegger said the fuel cell technology was "shaping the future of energy". For the moment, Bloom and BlueGen are operating on a different scale - one fridge-sized Bloom Box unit generates enough power to run a street block and costs up to $US800,000 ($A874,300). Ceramic Fuel Cells sees a bright future in Europe, but is less certain about a cautious Australian market still hooked on coal. It is lobbying hard to get the Victorian government to add it to a list of technologies that utilities are obligated to buy electricity from. "Not having that is why we've backed off in Australia," Dow says. "That's the single biggest hurdle to commercialisation in Australia." <!-- The New Statesman has a slightly harsh review of James Cameron's "Avatar" (though not as harsh as John Pilger's ) and a similar story evolving in India (minus the cool floating mountains) - Return of the natives . James Cameron's Avatar tells the story of a disabled ex-marine, sent from earth to infiltrate a race of blue-skinned aboriginal people on a distant planet and persuade them to let his employer mine their homeland for natural resources. Through a complex biological manipulation, the hero's mind gains control of his "avatar", in the body of a young aborigine. These aborigines are deeply spiritual and live in harmony with nature (they can plug a cable that sticks out of their body into horses and trees to communicate with them). Predictably, the marine falls in love with a beautiful aboriginal princess and joins the aborigines in battle, helping them to throw out the human invaders and saving their planet. At the film's end, the hero transposes his soul from his damaged human body to his aboriginal avatar, thus becoming one of them. Given the 3-D hyperreality of the film, with its combination of real actors and animated digital corrections, Avatar should be compared to films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) or The Matrix (1999). In each, the hero is caught between our ordinary reality and an imagined universe - of cartoons in Roger Rabbit, of digital reality in The Matrix, or of the digitally enhanced everyday reality of the planet in Avatar. What one should thus bear in mind is that, although Avatar's narrative is supposed to take place in one and the same "real" reality, we are dealing - at the level of the underlying symbolic economy - with two realities: the ordinary world of imperialist colonialism on the one hand, and a fantasy world, populated by aborigines who live in an incestuous link with nature, on the other. (The latter should not be confused with the miserable reality of actual exploited peoples.) The end of the film should be read as the hero fully migrating from reality into the fantasy world - as if, in The Matrix, Neo were to decide to immerse himself again fully in the matrix. ...Avatar's fidelity to the old formula of creating a couple, its full trust in fantasy, and its story of a white man marrying the aboriginal princess and becoming king, make it ideologically a rather conservative, old-fashioned film. Its technical brilliance serves to cover up this basic conservatism. It is easy to discover, beneath the politically correct themes (an honest white guy siding with ecologically sound aborigines against the "military-industrial complex" of the imperialist invaders), an array of brutal racist motifs: a paraplegic outcast from earth is good enough to get the hand of abeautiful local princess, and to help the natives win the decisive battle. The film teaches us that the only choice the aborigines have is to be saved by the human beings or to be destroyed by them. In other words, they can choose either to be the victim of imperialist reality, or to play their allotted role in the white man's fantasy. At the same time as Avatar is making money all around the world (it generated $1bn after less than three weeks of release), something that strangely resembles its plot is taking place. The southern hills of the Indian state of Orissa, inhabited by the Dongria Kondh people, were sold to mining companies that plan to exploit their immense reserves of bauxite (the deposits are considered to be worth at least $4trn). In reaction to this project, a Maoist (Naxalite) armed rebellion exploded... <!-- The Australian has a report on some of the concerns being raised about the coal seam gas boom in Queensland - Methane bonanza not for all . WHILE international business is starting to take a closer interest in Queensland's fledgling liquefied natural gas industry, farmers on the Darling Downs, where the gas will be extracted, don't see much upside in having 30,000 oil wells springing up in their paddocks. There are four big proposals for extraction of coal seam methane gas, predominantly from the western Darling Downs region. These proposals involve piping the gas to Gladstone, where it is liquefied before being exported. Energy giants British Gas and Santos have projects under examination, and this week Shell sought to increase its presence by making a takeover offer for Origin Energy, which has vast reserves of coal-seam methane on the downs in the area known as the Surat Basin. The Queensland government talks longingly of how LNG can save the Queensland economy. Premier Anna Bligh and Treasurer Andrew Fraser say the industry can bring 18,000 jobs, investment of $40 billion, an increase of $3bn in gross state product, and $850 million in royalties alone each year. All this plus a better environmental outcome, as gas-fired power stations are considerably more greenhouse-friendly than coal-fired ones. Origin Energy's gas-fired power station on the Darling Downs is due to be commissioned over the next few months. But what the politicians and the big companies are coy about is the effect all this activity will have on the land from which the coal-seam gas is extracted. Having four LNG projects go ahead in Gladstone will mean that about 30,000 small wells will have to be dug back in the Surat Basin west of Brisbane. Each well will occupy an area of about 20sq m on the ground, and these 30,000 wells will have to be linked by a network of pipelines, with two pipes to carry away the water and the gas that is extracted. From the wells, each company will have several smaller processing plants that will undertake a preliminary refining of the gas before it is put into a larger pipeline that runs north, away from crowded southeast Queensland and towards the coast at the port of Gladstone, where the north side of the harbour has been set aside as the designated LNG refining area. There are two main areas where the gas will be extracted, the Surat Basin and the Bowen Basin, west of Gladstone. While few of the 30,000 wells are on quality agricultural land, farmers are still worried about their impact. It's not only the wells and pipes (which will be underground), it's also the roads and tracks that need to be built to service the wells. <!-- The Warrnambool Standard has an article on a large new wind farm that may be built in Victoria - Plans for Southern Hemisphere's biggest windfarm revealed . A NEW player in the south-west wind energy market is preparing to launch a major project near Penshurst. Res Australia has confirmed its interest in building turbines on farmland near the small community, with executives to meet local residents in the next eight weeks. The Department of Primary Industries website lists the farm as capable of generating up to 625 megawatts of electricity, allowing it to support more than 350,000 homes. It would dwarf an $800 million, 365-megawatt development to be built near Macarthur and create hundreds of jobs in a region embracing renewable energy opportunities. Test towers have been installed on district properties to establish the strength and consistency of wind for power generation as further preparatory work continues. Res Australia developer Simon Kerrison said the company hoped to progress its plans within nine months. "We're still in the early stages; we're doing initial studies and surveys just to make sure the project is viable in the area," he said. While unable to confirm the farm's likely output, Mr Kerrison said Res had deemed early results strong enough to warrant closer investigation. A 625-megawatt wind farm would be among the largest in the world, joining massive
operations in the US and Romania. <!-- Time has an article on the (long rumoured ) presence of substantial amounts of oil in East Africa - Is East Africa the Next Frontier for Oil? . According to local lore, Portuguese travelers as far back as the late 19th century suspected that oil might lie beneath parts of East Africa after noticing a thick, greasy sediment wash up on the shores of Mozambique. More interested in finding cheap labor, though, the explorers had little use for oil. A century later, it turns out that the Portuguese were right. Seismic tests over the past 50 years have shown that countries up the coast of East Africa have natural gas in abundance. Early data compiled by industry consultants also suggest the presence of massive offshore oil deposits. Those finds have spurred oil explorers to start dropping more wells in East Africa, a region they say is an oil and gas bonanza just waiting to be tapped, one of the last great frontiers in the hunt for hydrocarbons. "I and a lot of other people in oil companies working in East Africa have long been convinced that it's the last real high-potential area in the world that hasn't been fully explored," says Richard Schmitt, chief executive of Black Marlin Energy, a Dubai-based East Africa oil prospector. "It seems, for a variety of geopolitical reasons, that more than anything else, it's been neglected over the last several decades. Most of those barriers are currently being lowered or [have] disappeared altogether." Few have wanted to pay the cost of searching for oil or gas in the region, or risk drilling wells in volatile countries such as Uganda, Mozambique or Somalia. But better technology, lower risk in some of the countries and higher oil prices in recent years have changed the equation. Wildcatters and majors such as Italy's Eni, Petronas of Malaysia and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) have all moved on East Africa in the past few years. They're hoping to mimic London-based Tullow Oil, which discovered some 2 billion bbl. of oil in landlocked Uganda over the past four years. Last month, Texas-based oil company Anadarko Petroleum Corp. announced that it had tapped a giant reservoir of natural gas off the coast of Mozambique. "Anadarko's find went off like a bomb here in Houston," says Robert Bertagne, a Texas-based oil wildcatter. "It was, 'Wow, we are finding large quantities of gas, and that means we have hydrocarbons in the area.' Once you have a discovery, more people are going to go in there." (See pictures of oil fires.) Much of East Africa's hopes are focused on a fault line running from Somalia to Madagascar known as the Davie Fracture Zone. It's there that Bertagne's analysis — using Cold War–era sea-floor mapping originally intended for use by Soviet submarines — has prompted speculation about oil deposits rivaling those of the North Sea or Middle East. There's still a lot that's unknown: North Africa has seen 20,000 wells sunk over the past few decades, while drillers have sunk 14,000 wells in and off West Africa. In East Africa, the total is about 500 wells. <!-- WorldWatch has a look at the slowly declining nuclear power industry - World Nuclear Generation Stagnates . For the second year in a row, global nuclear generating capacity has dropped slightly, reaching 370.9 gigawatts (GW) at the end of 2009. Just over 1 GW of capacity was added during the year, as India and Japan each connected a new plant to the grid. At the same time, Japan closed two reactors and Lithuania one, so there were 2,506 GW worth of shutdowns. While installed capacity has been virtually flat for the past five years, construction starts surged in 2009 thanks to a burst of activity in China. Altogether, construction began on 11 nuclear power reactors in 2009, the highest number since 14 units were started in 1985. Some 56 nuclear reactors are now officially being built—but 13 of these have been “under construction” for more than 20 years, and 26 reactors have encountered “construction delays.” As noted, 3 nuclear reactors were permanently closed in 2009, bringing the total number of decommissioned units to 126, representing a retired nuclear capacity of nearly 40 GW. The average age of all decommissioned reactors is 22 years. Hamaoka 1 and 2, the two reactors that were shut down in Japan, were originally damaged by a 2007 earthquake that struck while they were undergoing safety-related upgrades. The cost of seismic retrofitting of these two reactors was so high that the operator, Chubu Electric, decided to close them permanently and plans to build a single large reactor to replace them by 2018. <!--

An Ode to Women in Technology This post is part of Ada Lovelace Day , in honor of women excelling in technology. Quick. Who was the first computer programmer? Pause... The answer: Ada Lovelace She wrote the first "program" for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. Babbage conceived the idea only to perform calculations, but Lovelace saw beyond that purpose to the possibility that that first "computer" could calculate Bernoulli numbers.- My decade-plus in the technology world has showered me with blessings. One of these is the women that have guided and inspired me. Here are a few that I want to thank profusely for their guidance, support, and inspiration: Michelle opened the door. Lisa illuminates just how big the world can be. Liz inspires with her burning intelligence and amazing poise. Cyd shows how art, spiritual, and professional life coexist. Christina creates new worlds with her ability to reinvent herself. Kit helps me see the practical path and how to plot my own. Stephanie embodies true wisdom, creativity, and focus. And, last, but not least, thanks to Mom for being completely open. Without her example, no doubt that it would be far more difficult to recognize the amazing women that surround me. At the IA Summit this past week in Memphis, it was brought to our attention that the UX community is blessed to have so many women that actively lead our practice. I thank my lucky stars every day. -The analytical engine was never built, but let's not blame Lovelace for the failure of the men around her. Photo credit: Thanks to kpwerker for her great Flickr photo . In his 2007 TED talk, Michael Pollan discusses the arc that has taken him from his garden to his truly illuminatory set of books (from Botany of Desire to In Defense of Food ) and what he has learned about our relationship with nature and our food. Why is this here? It reflects where we go wrong in designing our organizations. We attempt set up a system where we take people and insert them into a machine that is designed to bend their will to a strategy. There are capital inputs, information, and time. The people and technology output goods and/or services, receive the revenue, pay the bills, and take care of the customers. This sounds great, until in practice you realize that the strategy decided on by the executive leadership loses it's effectiveness at the front lines, except for rare cases. (Southwest Airlines comes to mind here.) Check out this key point from Pollan: [Another TED talk on ethanol] helped me understand industrial agriculture, which of course is a Cartesian system. It's based on this idea of that we bend other species to our will, and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories, and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want. [tells an amazing story about the Salatin PolyFace permaculture farm] This is a different way to think about nature. And a way to get away from zero sum notion, from the Cartesian idea that nature's winning, or we're winning. Michael Pollan, The Omnivore's Next Dilemma , TED, March 2007 What Salatin does is create a situation where his animals and the grass that they graze on maximize their "desires" and, in turn, produce a truly incredible bounty of food with respect to the amount of land and the investment put into it. The cows are not slammed into a barn, given a bunch of corn (which is not good for them), shot up with antibiotics, and fattened until they are "market-ready." Rather, they are moved from small plot to small plot, grazing on brand new delicious grass that they is there desired delicacy. Chickens then follow them into that same plot a few days later, feed on their delicacy (fat maggots), and they defecate as they scatter the cow manure across the lot - which acts as fertilizer for the grass. Amazingly, the grass itself contributes to this cycle. It was tall, just before the cows enter the plot. After they leave, it sheds much of it's root system (due to the root-shoot ratio). Fungi, worms, and the like digest the dead roots into new soil. Just a few weeks later, the grass is again luxurious and tall, ready for the next cycle. Businessfolk would do well to take a close look at these methods. We can continue to scale our organizations based on executive strategy, adding more capital and more people to execute the decisions of the central structure. The problem with that approach is that the changing relationship of the organization to its capital and the importance of engaging your employees and customers at a more basic level (similar to meeting the desires of the cows, grass, and chickens) are changing. My gut tells me that the answer lies in creating organizations that satisfy all the parts like Salatin's farm does. You might think of the executives as the farmer, the cows and chickens as the employees, and the grass (and animal feed) as the capital inputs. The customers are the same ones who want a Polyface chicken so badly that they drive out to the farm to pick it up. (To read more about the farm, check out the excerpt from The Omnivore's Dilemma on Mother Jones .) Why should we care about this? Well, as a designer, I've run into too many situations where organization were ill-suited to ingesting and assimilating what the customers and employees really need to be fully engaged. This is not a knock on any executive, manager, or employee. Rather, it's just the truth of how the information flows and responsibility distributed in most organizations today. Through methods like mental models , we can get into the thought processes of all involved and figure out where disconnects or misunderstandings lie. I am building a practice around these models and how they can align an organization's resources and people in way most effective for both the company and the customers. I hope you'll come back at some point as I explore these and similar issues in ways that show why such a practice is necessary and how it can be carried out. Jeremiah Owyang, indomitable social media analyst, absolutely nails why large organizations will find it very, very difficult to allow the level of transparency and real interaction necessary to evolve their businesses (both strategy and operations) as the face of market and internal communications continues to evolve. He distinguishes three "impossible" conversations: asking for feedback, saying positive things about [their] competitors, and admitting [they] were wrong. Asking for feedback is fine, but most organizations are not at all set up to actually listen, ingest the feedback, and decide whether or how to address the issue. Employees are at the breaking point already. "Productivity" in most organizations means employees are left with precious little time to adjust to new ideas unless they come from management or from within carefully managed feedback channels. Some employees may be able to get ahead or ignore some of their work and find ways to try new things. These mavericks should be rewarded. Social technologies (wikis, blogs, social networks) can help, but unless they are used in concert, it's difficult to use them effectively. Imagine a symphony without a conductor where the musicians are all playing different music at the same time or, in well-run organizations, the same music to different rhythms. Experience allows me to understand why saying positive things about [their] competitors is so difficult, but I wish there was a way to show the larger organizational consciousness why this fear is more destructive than anything. Companies use ideas from their competitors all the time, so not giving deserved kudos is paramount to denigrating many of that company's own ideas. Market results display an organization's effectiveness, so stop being afraid to show some appreciation of those with whom you share industry space. Jeremiah makes this excellent point: Customers aren’t stupid. In fact, they know who your competition is, and they talk amongst each other. Most companies are not actually part of the conversation, but mostly adjacent to it. In that position, they will miss some critical piece of intelligence. Right now, the status quo might be holding, but the effort required to use the same channels for marketing, customer service, and institutional knowledge is growing. Sooner or later, this self-imposed ignorance will come back to haunt them. Admitting [they] were wrong is difficult for everyone at turns, yet most individuals let their guards down at some point. Yes, organizations have to worry about legal culpability, but in the end they MUST learn to understand that, if they are up front and act quickly when mistakes occur, the likelihood that customers will be furious enough to sue is greatly reduced. And, if they do, then the problem hasn't been resolved. None of these conversations are easy, nor are large organizations the only holdouts. Even individuals and small companies screw them up all the time. However, the pressures to really listen and speak honestly are becoming ever more critical to connect people both inside and outside of the organization. Here are two sentences that capture where I am at the moment: [O]rganizations have simply lost a sense of what it actually means to be creative. For some reason, thinking and speaking are accepted as more important work than thinking and making. Chris Conley of Gravity Tank , in discussion with Adaptive Path's Henning Fischer Does this apply only to organizations? Looking at the amazing people that surround us, I'm struck by how much effort the design community expends in talking, blogging, and documenting every little thought and experience we have. I'm just as guilty as anyone else,- maybe more so as the things going on around us tend to set me thinking and thinking and thinking... In the end, we are going to see some great transformations of work and life experience in the next several years. Gravity Tank is only one example of smart people having an impact far beyond the website. Right now, I'm dedicating myself to the making part for a while and looking forward to sharing what happens to my thinking and speaking as a result. That dedication has taken the form of joining CloudRaker , an amazing design and development agency in Montreal. Creative potential exists everywhere -- in every person, and as such in every organization -- but the current environment inhibits our ability to tease it into action. I will come out of this new experience not only re-grounded in making that happen, but also hope to do so in French. Here goes nothing! Happy holidays to everyone. - Yes, I know, not talking here, mostly in person. Maybe I should at least be typing. Stay tuned... Recently on the excellent bplusd blog, Jess interviews Brandon Schauer of Adaptive Path about designers' desire to contribute to the strategic discussion with business folks. I really like this statement, as it reflects a trend that I'm seeing (and may be guilty of myself): I think it gets reinforced by some people in the design community who make the leap from the fact that "I identify as a designer, and therefore I am a design thinker, and I can make these great strategic contributions if they’d only let me." There’s this note of almost entitlement that has crept into the design community. That’s something I’m particularly cautious about because I think that most designers aren ’t design thinkers yet because they don’t have the concrete fluency with business, and many visual designers don’t face the same constraints on actual usage that an interaction designer or industrial designer face. As designers, we get used to exploring possibilities and finding creative solutions, but we don't necessarily ever pay the price or see the real impact of what we create. I'm troubled by that note of entitlement, particularly from people who have added business vocabulary to their repertoire, expecting that to be enough. It's not enough . We must also take the time to truly understand what it means to make business decisions and deal every single day with the repercussi ons . - There is a reason that most business conversations include a healthy dose of reality checking, namely that in business, you make a decision, see how it worked, and make another. Designers can help widen the considered field of these decisions, but we must also be willing to see the constraints and know where to push the envelope. In some ways, the relationship between design and business is the same as that between design and technology. Design creates something; technology builds it. These relationships work far better when there is some involvement of the builders during design (and vice versa ) along with feedback once the building is complete and the result out in the ether. This conversation is why you often hear about "accountability" in post- mortems on software projects. (In fact, I should probably label that arrow as such. Let's imagine it for a moment.) So back to business and design. How do they relate to the design/build discussion? Well, instead of just being told what to design: Designers want input into the possible solutions to a problem. We need to learn to talk to each other better to make this work. At the IIT Strategy Conference (link from bplusd ), Roger Martin, dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto, gave a great talk about the approaches based on validity (design) versus reliability (business). He covers both what both designers and businesspeople can do to smooth communication and, therefore, benefit from a better working relationship. Schauer illustrates just how that might work with this anecdote from a recent project: We helped identify key metrics that people actually cared about that the web and the interactive marketing group could actually impact, and how can we calculate the impact that a potential project could have on those numbers. Suddenly, they are having this financial dialog, when before they were just talking about personas or user flows and things like that. So that really changed their relationship with the rest of the organization by being able to think through and articulate things in a way that was valued. Don't you want to have that same relationship with your colleagues, regardless of your perspective? We would all benefit from it. Check out the full interview , which includes many ways designers can get smarter about business. Hello, all! Though quiet the blog front be for me, the words flow ever more. Trust that, when I've something to say, it will appear in this exact space. If you catch me in person, I'll talk your ear off, to be sure. Portland was lovely, thank you very much. WebVisions plays mellower than the IA Summit, which I appreciated with my need to keep my mind on my presentation and enjoy my Portland friends. Jeremiah Owyang of Web-strategist.com and Podtech caught me in the hallway at the Portland Convention Center to ask me a few questions about how corporate managers can understand and leverage IAs in their work. Dissecting Big and Little IA on the fly was not an easy feat, but I enjoyed the conversation and the challenge. Thanks, Jeremiah! Also, Jaman continues to sprout happily . Over the last couple releases, we've made huge upgrades to the software, website, and the movie catalog. For those foreign film fans out there, look for many familiar classic and provocative movies coming online shortly. For more about Jaman and what we're attempting, see me blab further about Jaman on Lunchmeet . Also, Boxes &amp; Arrows hums along quite well. I generally act behind the curtain there, but plan on occasion to emerge with an article or two over the next few months. So, that's my story for now. Feel free to drop me a line and let me know what you're up to. Hey all, Back in minor self-promotion mode, I'll be speaking at WebVisions in Portland, May 3-4 on the how technology allows (or makes!) us step out of our comfort zone to follow our ideas into new places, connect with people with whom we can make them happen, and find real innovation in spite of the cynicism and inertia of entrenched institutions. I got the idea for this talk after seeing many friends going into business for themselves, hearing folks speak of such paths at the IA Summit , including Joshua Prince-Ramus amazing architecture projects
. At WebVisions, I'll zoom out to explore what this might mean not only for Web professionals, but for the petri dishes of change (buzzword: innovation) in many facets of our lives. This is a conference that I've heard good things about previously, but this will be my first time attending. The lineup is an incredible mix of designers, coders, entrepreneurs, and strategists ( too many to detail here ). One talk I'll be watching closely is David Pescovitz' (of BoingBoing fame) thought about how info overload will be conquered . That intrigues me to no end. If you're going to be in Portland for WV, let me know! So as I noted a couple of posts ago, this year has gotten off to a very interesting start. First the articles on Boxes & Arrows and the IA Summit precon took things in a new direction, now film festival season rejuvenates the batteries. Along the way, another huge opportunity came a-knockin'. Liz Danzico the Great has handed over the B&amp;A Editor-in-Chief reigns to me, with Christina making the official announcement during 3-minute Madness at the Summit. Thanks, Christina, for trusting me with your baby. Finally, a bit more attention will be paid to how this blog communicates what I'm thinking. Those of you who know me well probably laugh at my posting frequency, as it's basically a minute fraction of my brain cycles. However, even those folks know that I'm quite considerate in my attempts to keep from creating noise. When I have something to say, I'll continue to show up. Taking a look at the postings I've been making and in recognition of these new currents, I'm making a small change to the blog title - from User eXperience to eXperience. Minutiae to be sure, but I feel better about that electronic visage. I still love the users, but I'm more interested in these days about the whole enchilada of relationships we need in our lives. My experience tells me that by facing just that one way (towards customers), user experience professionals do a disservice to the environments we want to help create -- where we discern how the web of relationships affects everyone involved, whether direct or indirect. This little change nods to where I'm going. Shall we?

The draft code, currently under consultation, singles out vegans, who do not eat animal products or wear leather, as meriting protection from religious discrimination. It says: “A person who is a vegan chooses not to use or consume animal products of any kind. That person eschews the exploitation of animals for food, clothing, accessories or any other purpose and does so out of an ethical commitment to animal welfare.”The code says the current definition of “belief” also included “a lack of belief”, giving protection to atheists. Tony says; If anything vegans have even more conviction, dedication and focus on their philosophy than many other followers of beliefs. Vegans would suffer the same if not more emotional distress as any member of a religious group if they were punished for their beliefs. Veganism is more altruistic too there's no dangling carrot of heaven or vahalla or threat of hell if you don't adhere.

Yes that's right you heard me correctly, vegan Cadbury creme eggs!

After a few seconds to get over the excitement I bit the top off and devoured it there and then in a full frenzied chocoholic maniacal episode.

That's why it's been moved to Hove so expert ethical caterers can be brought in. The Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre March 20th 2010 at The Hove Centre Some of the UK’s finest veggie food producers gather together at the first ever Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre on Saturday March 20th from 11am – 6pm, with the organisers expecting thousands of people through the door to experience the delights of one of the UK’s fastest growing lifestyle choices – the veggie diet. Some choose to be veggie on health grounds, others because they are concerned about the welfare of animals, but a growing number of people from all backgrounds are going veggie for one reason only – the food! Veggie food has long since shed the earnest but rather dull hippy image of the 70’s, and with leading UK veggie caterers at the Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre including the likes of V Bites, Heather Mill’s flagship Hove based restaurant, alongside food producers with the likes of the award winning Fry’s and Redwood ranges available to sample free, there’s a huge choice to be had. ‘Visitors to the show will be spoilt for choice when it comes to what to eat’ says the organiser Tim Barford from Bristol based hemp firm Yaoh. ‘There’s an incredible selection of really tasty food on offer and all of it is 100% plant based. We have up to 80 stalls at the event with some amazing products on offer, including bodycare and clothes, plus loads of information – it’s a really good way to find out just how good the veggie lifestyle can be.’ With a talks room, a cookery demos area, and an entertainments arena as well as an all day licensed bar, there’s a full line up to suit all tastes and with an admission price of just £3 for adults and £1 for kids and OAP’s, Tim is expecting a full house. ‘There’s a real increase in interest in anything eco friendly and especially in Brighton and Hove, which has the biggest population of veggies anywhere on the planet’ add Tim,’ and with such an excellent variety of products, food, experts and information available, its going to be a busy day.’ It’s not all fun and games though – there are some serious issues at stake, and the keynote speech at the event looks at Global Food Security, and in particular the effect livestock farming has on developing countries. ‘We are very pleased to have Dr Stephen Walsh from the Vegan Society at the show to deliver this vital talk’ says Tim. ‘We have to remember we are all responsible for what happens next on this planet.’ www.brighton.ecoveggiefayre.co.uk The show is organised by Yaoh and sponsored by Beanie’s Health Foods, V Bites, Chunkies and Macrobiotic Shop, and supported by Excellart, Ethical Singles, VeggieVision, Foods for Life and Flax Farm Linseed.

"I'm not a vegetarian but......." "I don't eat much meat..."/ "I'm almost vegetarian" / "I just eat fish and a little chicken" Despite the urge you occassionally may have to shake these people you should try to remember that it is these well meaning but non commital stand on the fence vegetarian spectators that keep vegetarianism and veganism moving forward. Without the vegetarian spectators, vegan dippers and semi - conscious consumers the fully conscious consumers and vegans who get it (get the fact that ill health and devastation of the planet are mostly down to eating the wrong way) would have a much harder time. All those soya, rice, nut and oat milk dairy alternative products and veggie sausages wouldn't be still so abundant on the shelves were it not for all the part time healthy eaters and environmentalists trying to do their occassional bit. Granted it is fast approaching the point where a bit is not enough to save the planet, but even a bit is better than nothing when it is millions of people. So Thank you Gwyneth Paltrow and your Goop blog - "I'm not a vegetarian but..." is pretty lame, especially considering your husband's passion for logic and reason. I'm no longer a fan of yours since you draped yourself in fur but....... thank you for plugging Paul McCartney's meat free monday and laying down the facts for your celebrity and fashion obcessed followers.

PSYCHIATRIST: "Okay, tell me about this recurrent dream that you just had. Don't leave anything out." DREAMER: "Well, as it always does, it started on a beach on a cold and overcast day. The place was almost empty, and I remember wondering where everyone was. Even in the winter there should have been people walking their dogs. Where were they now?" DREAMER: "Across the water I marveled at what appeared to be glaciers, but I also wondered how that could be. I mean, there weren't supposed to be glaciers there." DREAMER: "Unable to take the cold any longer, I walked over to a nearby hotel, hoping to get warm in the lobby." DREAMER: "An employee appeared at the door. He had a mocking, impudent face, and I could tell that he was going to turn me away, but a voice from inside told him to let me in. He reluctantly opened the door." DREAMER: "Inside a man with a fedora beckoned me to get into an elevator with him." DREAMER: "We went to the top floor in silence, and when the door opened...we were in a ballroom! People were dancing lethargically, as if they'd been doing it for a long time." DREAMER: "The man in the hat pointed to a window." DREAMER: "I looked outside but didn't see anything special. It was daytime and kids were playing in the street." DREAMER: "I turned to ask the man what I was supposed to be seeing, but he was gone. It looked like he'd escaped onto the roof." DREAMER: "I turned to the window again and this time everything had changed. It was dark outside. Somehow night had fallen, and the impossibly thick and expanding glacier I'd seen out at sea was now right outside the window, slowly and inexorably pushing cars and debris ahead of it. At the speed it was going it would only be a matter of hours before the town and everybody in it would be crushed. " DREAMER: "In a panic I shouted to a man who was on the phone nearby. Nothing I said seemed to matter to him." DREAMER: "I called to an old woman too, and got big belly laughs in return. She thought it was hilarious." PATRONS: "Hey, quiet down over there! If you want to shout, go outside!" BAND LEADER: "Yes, why don't you go? Nobody wants you here." DREAMER: "I knew it wouldn't do any good to argue, and I had a strong feeling that if I'd stayed something horrible would happen, so I made for the stairs." DREAMER: "On the way down it occurred to me that I might not be the only person who didn't know about the glacier. I thought I'd warn the other people in the hotel, so I frantically knocked on doors. One opened by itself revealing a fat man screaming on a couch. I tried to reason with him but the more I talked, the louder he shrieked." DREAMER: "Another door opened into a room of people who appeared to be waiting for something. They were indifferent to what I said about the glacier, and seemed to resent my presence." DREAMER: "Other people just stared." DREAMER: "The final door opened and revealed...revealed what? What kind of crazy place was this?" DREAMER: "Out on the street it was dark and there was snow on the ground." DREAMER: "No use trying to get my car. It was somewhere under the glacier now." DREAMER: "In the distance I thought I heard a humming and churning noise. I didn't pay much attention at first." DREAMER: "After a while the sound was deafening. Holding my ears I looked this way and that, and finally came across a shaft of light zig - zagging its way methodically over the sidewalk. When I looked up to find the source I saw it... a round, mechanical thing in the sky, with a searchlight in one eye. It scanned the street, apparently looking for people. I hid behind a pillar til it passed." DREAMER: "It's a good thing I did because round flying things were soon all over the streets, incinerating every human who couldn't hide fast enough." DREAMER: "If that wasn't bad enough, groups of predatory human spotters began to emerge from nearby buildings and joined the hunt. Whenever they spotted a fleeing man they blew a whistle, which summoned the killing machines. How could people do that to their own kind?" DREAMER: "I saw a group of men on their hands and knees, and ran over to them to warn them. I did everything to get their attention but to no avail. They were absorbed in watching something that was in the ice under their feet." DREAMER: "I looked down, and sure enough there really was something down there. I know it doesn't make sense, but there were...there were live women under there... and they were beckoning to the men on the surface. " DREAMER: "These were no ordinary women. Most were stunningly beautiful and they flirted like sirens. A few had the sentimental appearance of beloved and long-dead mothers and sisters. Every man saw the unique woman that he yearned for." Finally one of the men, unable to restrain himself any longer, reached out and clasped the hand of one of the women. DREAMER: "He was immediately pulled under the ice and drowned..." DREAMER: "...as I was a moment later. I remember looking up at the hole in the ice as my lungs filled with freezing water. As it always does in these dreams the hole filled with light as killing machines leaned down and watched me with impersonal interest. I guess with all that thrashing around I put on a pretty good show. " DREAMER: "And that's it! That's the point where I always wake up. What does it mean? Am I going crazy?" PSYCHIATRIST: "Crazy? No, no. Not crazy. We'll talk about it next week. I do have to remind you though, that the magazines in the waiting room are for all my patients, and if you continue to take them home I'll have to charge you for them." THE END BTW: Many thanks to the excellent blog, "Shadowplay," which is where I got most of these pictures. http://dcairns.wordpress.com/ Okay, here's (above) a revised version of the second draft. Please, please tell me if you find that any of it is still confusing. It works for me, but maybe I've lost my objectivity. Many, many thanks to commenters who let me know what was wrong with the previous versions. Click to enlarge. Kali sent me this video (above)! What a pal! What a pal! Have you seen the George Liquor on a log that she's selling on her site? It's beautiful! Spike Jones is a caricaturist's dream (above)! His head is shaped like an upright football, with a wide, cartoony middle section, and a narrow top and bottom. The young Liberace had a fascinating face (above)! It was wide with heavily padded cheeks, tiny eyes and a thin, pointed nose and chin. The teeth were tucked way in under the nose, and the hair was combed up and back, making it look like it was on fire. The older Liberace (above) looks a lot more normal. Plastic surgery? BTW, this clip is really funny. If you're rushed, then start it at the 2 1/2 minute mark. Who is this (above)? He has a wonderfully comic face (above) set off by a round, volumetric body and interesting vest wrinkles. Vests were God's gift to caricaturists, but nobody wears them anymore. This (above) is A. J. Muste, a famous pacifist and thorn in the side of the Johnson Administration. He had a long, narrow head with a huge pointed nose, thick horn rims and a high, bread loaf fedora. This reminds me that most artists don't draw fedoras big enough. A good fedora always changes the head shape, always looks a bit too straight up and awkward. This (above) is the Mount Everest of eccentric fedoras...true royalty of the hat world. I love the way the hat continues the outline of the hair. If I ever see these on sale I'll hock my children to get the money to buy one. Stepin Fetchit's half closed eyes (above) and high eyebrows were his trademarks, but the thing that really made them work was the "U" shaped bulge above his nose. Charles Laughton (above) had even more facial padding than Liberace, but in Laughton's case the pads are relaxed and friendly, and even a little floppy. His face consists of small circles (above) embedded inside larger circles; spheres overlapping spheres. Last but not least is Louis B. Mayer (above). His head and body look bland and ordinary, but his eyes are 1,000% alert and ready to go on the offensive. It's the contradiction of blandness and unexpected vitality that makes this picture hard to put down. BTW, I'm in a podcast on the ASIFA Hollywood Animation Archive site!!!!!! This is the second installment, and this came out a lot better than the first. I talk about drawing theories, story, direction, how to do difficult assignments and all that. If you're curious to hear what I have to say, then give a listen! http://www.animationarchive.org/podcast/ Right now I'm between jobs and unfortunately have plenty of time to fuss over things like cooking. In the past two months or so I've done a lot of experimenting with lunches. I was looking for something that would allow me to lose weight, but which would be tasty and sustainable; something which would form the centerpiece of my lunches for years to come, regardless of deviations. I was anxious to make my peace with vegetables too, so they had to be in there. After trying a bunch of foods I came up with what I think is a clear cut winner, which I'll reveal at the end of the post. I think it'll surprise you...but first I want to tell you about some of the meals I tried. Well, the first thing I tried was the complicated vinaigrette salad that I call "The Parallel Universe Salad," after the physicist friend who turned me on to it. I put up the recipe in a post about two years ago. I ate it four times a week for several weeks, and it was so delicious and so filling that I sometimes skipped dinner afterward, without missing it. A success, you say? Mmmm, not exactly. The problem was that I ate so much of it that I began to get tired of it. You can get too much of a good thing. Not only that, but it sometimes left me with a craving for ice-cream a few hours later, making me wonder if the salad was really satisfying my need for fat. It was delicious, but I felt I had to move on. After that, I tried frozen Marie Calendar pot pies. I microwaved them for 15 minutes as per the instructions on the box, then when they came out, and were still intensely hot inside, I stuffed them with half-cooked veggies. By veggies I mean mushrooms cooked in a little olive oil and bacon fat, and slightly cooked diced celery, walnuts, onion, and any vegetable I had in the refrigerator that could take the heat. It was great. the problem was, that these pies and veggies tasted so good that I ate nothing else for a week, and then grew tired of them, at least for a while. Next I tried soups. Soups make good lunches, and are good repositories for veggies. I'd heat up Campbell's Chicken Broth, throw in some of those tangled bean noodles that look like birds nests, throw in spinach and Japanese pre-cooked fish or shrimp, and at the very end, toss in some hard-boiled egg slices. Delicious! Campbell's makes a good mushroom soup too, and into that I poured my usual mushrooms, veggies, fettuccini, and some cut-up boiled ham slices. [I found it handy to always have mushrooms, celery, walnuts, ham slices, and fettucini around. They're good for adding bulk to almost anything you cook. I always have alfredo handy, too. Alfredo is fattening, so I only use it in small quantities, usually to ease the pain of eating vegetables that I don't like.] Oh, and I took a liking to fennel (above). If you don't know what that is, it's the ugly white and green bagpipe of a vegetable that you always pass by in the supermarket because it looks so alien. It's a real Frankenstein monster of grafted elements: mild white onion-type mass on the bottom, celery-type stalks in the middle, and delicate little dill-type leaves at the top. I know that doesn't sound appetizing but, trust me, it tastes better than it looks. How does it taste? Well, it's like a sweet, slightly licorice-flavored, extremely mild onion. It's not really an onion, but it looks and feels that way. It's very cheery and eager-to-please, and makes good filler in a recipe that requires bulk. I cooked it with mushrooms and shallots and added it to other things. It was great, but once again I ate so much of it that I couldn't bear to look at it for a while. This brings me to the grand finale, where I reveal the most successful lunch recipe I tried during that time. Which recipe got the top spot? I hate to say it, but none of them. They were all too doggone tasty and fattening. I ended up gaining weight instead of losing it. The only lunch I ate during those few weeks that was consistently delicious, dietetic, healthy and sustainable was.....drum beat, please.....good old American peanut butter and jam on bread or muffin, served with milk. Yep, that and nothing else. A popular hippie book called "Diet for a Small Planet" also recommends it. It's nutritious and you never get tired of it. Something in the chemistry of it makes it ever-green for your taste buds. It doesn't go with vegetables, though. I guess I'll have to save those for dinner. So that's it for now...but I'll put on my mad scientist cap and keep experimenting. I thought I'd put up a few examples of surreal cinematic nightmare sequences. The first (above) is from a film called "Bewitched," which according to Thomas in a comment, was directed by Arch Oboler (Thomas also recommends Oboler's other film, "The Twonky"). The clip looks like something Borzage would have made. Borzage is a favorite director of David Cairn who runs one of the most interesting cinema sites on the net, a blog called "Shadowplay." That's where I got this video. The end sequence of "Stranger on the Third Floor" makes such an indelible impression that it's easy to forget the surreal second-best sequence (above) that's in the middle of the film. For those who've forgotten, here it is. This (above) is a trailer for the re-release of Hitchcock's "Vertigo." Not all the shots are from the film's nightmare, but this cut still succeeds in being nightmarish. More of "Vertigo;" this time, the main titles. Bernard Herrmann's film scores are some of the best classical music written in the 20th Century, but he's seldom on concert programs. Is that the fault of the concert halls or of lawyers who make it hard to get the rights? I tried to buy sheet music for piano transcriptions of his work and couldn't find any, even on the net. Thanks to Jerk for this clip from "Spellbound." Thanks to Kurdt for Disney's "Pink Elephants." And thanks to Anonymous for the "Wild Strawberries" video (above). Have I missed any good nightmares? Any suggestions? I'm reading a book about Thomas Cook called, "The Romantic Journey." Cook (above) was the world's first travel agent, and if you think that's a dull subject for a book then you couldn't be more wrong. Cook was a genius! The man was born in 1808 while Napoleon was still in power. He spent the first half of his life arranging tours to English seashore resorts for the religious and temperance societies that he belonged to. I don't think it ever occurred to him or anyone else that you could make much money doing that. He just wanted to be useful to the organizations he belonged to. Besides, if there was money to be made, it would logically go to the railroads and hotels, not to the poor fool who got stuck with buying everybody's tickets. Like I said, even Cook didn't think there was money in it. Travel in Cook's time was a dirty affair for people who weren' t rich. The railroads advertised cheap rates to the seaside towns, which resulted in shockingly crowded beaches and hotels. It wasn't uncommon for twelve people...twelve!...to share a bed, with other friends sleeping on the floor. Stressed out hotel patrons would sometimes show their resentment by pooping in the bureau drawers. The streets were crowded with rowdies and the beaches were so densely packed that bathers could hardly see the sand (above). Women who could afford it rented clunky changing room wagons which attendants pulled out into the surf for them. Occasionally big waves (above) would knock over the wagons and the women inside would have to be rescued....sometimes by naked men. It seems that a sizable number of men believed that bathing suits were unhealthy for the wearers. Cook's insight was that was that many people would be be happier in less crowded resorts in places like Scotland. Some of those resorts weren't served by the railroad, so Cook arranged for carriage
 or boats to supplement the rail service. Some English customers regarded the Scots as barbarous, and didn't relish the idea of negotiating with them for meals and hotel rooms, so Scott sent agents ahead to take care of all that, and he was even able to get group discounts. Little by little, he assembled the modern concept of the package tour. What's fascinating about all this was that each of Cook's improvements was copied by the railroads and steamship lines, who opened their own copy cat travel agencies, and who had the advantage of established reputations and lots of money for advertising. Amazingly, Cook managed to stay ahead of the game. How did he do it? Maybe it's because his competitors were just hirelings of the railroad and had to get every change okayed by higher-ups. Cook was free to innovate. When a woman on one of his tours complained about unsanitary foreign toilets seats, he quickly invented a personal folding metal toilet seat cover. Now that's enterprise! Cook also benefited from his philosophy. Other travel agencies were diverted by lucrative commissions from the wealthy. Cook, on the other hand, found it impossible to disavow his innate sympathy with the working man, and instead chose to treat his ordinary patrons as if they were wealthy. He arranged tours for the rich, but he was careful to keep his standard prices low, and expected customers to dress well and avoid offensive behavior. Rowdies got a refund and were booted out. The much admired civility of the British middle class owes a lot to the nudges it received from business men like Cook. BTW, the final two posters weren't originated by Cook's agency. I put them up because they exemplify the spirit of what the man was trying to achieve. Here they are, works of three of my favorite contemporary painters. I have more favorites, but these will do for a start. The first few are by Tim Biskup. You can tell he was influenced by Jim Flora, but his style is still very distinctive. Boy, the picture above is so small that it's impossible to see anything. Better click to enlarge. What I like about these, apart from their color and design sophistication, is what Ayn Rand might have called their "sense of life." They're happy. They celebrate life. There's no hint of suffering. They're about the light-hearted side of life. Here's (above) a skull, which is usually meant to symbolize mortality or horror or science. I may be reading something into this that's not there, but what I sense here is an artist who's regarding his own fragile mortality and laughing about it. There's time enough to think about the serious side of death. Here we're made to see the absurdity of it. The delicate, colorful paper strips are like our thoughts unraveling. Our skull unravels as well. We all see such wonders during our lifetimes, and they're recorded on flimsy strips of paper that eventually unravel and go away. It all reminds me of Macbeth's "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech. Very happy (above). Sexual, but very light and delicate. This (above) is scary but light-hearted at the same time, as if Biskup were reminding us that our humanity is still intact, in spite of the mechanistic nature of the modern world. Even so, he says we'd better be careful. Elegant, imaginative, clutter (above). This would make a great book cover for an author like Bradbury or Dahl or Borges. Here's something by an under-rated artist...Philip Burke. Michael Sporn just did a survey of Burke's work on his blog. See the sidebar for the link. Poor Woody. His face has aged way in advance of his actual chronological age. Has his mind aged at the same rate? I don't know. My guess is that a younger man lies underneath the aged exterior, but maybe looking that way depressed him so much that he actually took on the behaviors of an older man. Burke's portrait of Cobain says so much about the price Cobain paid to get where he was. Burke's sketch (above) of Dianne Sawyer. Look at how saturated the red and purple are. Last but not least, Gary Panter's "Elvis Zombie." This was a book cover. I'll bet Panter wishes he'd painted a version that was seven feet tall. I came across this photo of Elvis while I was searching for Panter's painting. It occured to me that this may be the most famous photo of the rock and roll era...what the classic photo of the G.I.s raising the flag at Iwo Jima was for the previous generation. Don't you love close-ups on big movie screens? Having live silhouette heads between you and the screen makes the experience even better. If you've never seen a Clampett cartoon on a big theater screen, then you've really missed something. His characters are always leaning into the audience and looking down. They plead with the audience, patronize them, almost pat them on their heads. You don't get that when you see the cartoons on TV. I love the idea of giant heads and bodies looming out over the audience and looking down. You don't even need 3D to get the effect. If you're Eisenstein or Richard Lester or Sergio Leonne then you love the technique where you show the audience an ultra-long shot then.... ...then, on the same shot you have someone step in front of the camera for an ultra close-up. I love it when monsters stick their heads out over the audience and look around, as if they're trying to figure out which person to eat first. Amazing but true: on a big 2D screen you can give the audience the physical sensation of looking up at something. I don't mean a simple upshot, I mean a shot where you get a definite sensation of light-headedness and insecurity about your balance, as if you'd tilted your head way back. To see what I mean, click to enlarge. It's not enough to tilt the camera up to get this effect. You have to have something very distracting to look at up there, else the audience's logic will kick in, and they'll talk themselves out of the vertigo you want them to feel. Oddly enough, shooting a glamorous woman in close-up doesn't always work. You can convey personality and charm in a close-up, but not sexiness...not sexiness in the glamour meaning of the word. I guess visual sex cues have a lot to do with proportions, and you need to step back a little to take that in. The close-ups are just punctuation. Okay, there are exceptions. How about "Rear Window" where Grace Kelly leans into the audience and almost kisses the camera? Watching this scene was what your grandfather did to cure erectile dysfunction in the days before Viagra. I saw "North by Northwest" on a big theater screen and the experience was a revelation. On a big screen the close-up shots in the cornfield make you feel that Cary Grant wants to jump into your lap. He seems to be appealing to the audience for help. I never got that from seeing the film on TV.
I've been extremely busy with DealBase work, so have lagged on blogging, but have some interesting things coming up and hope to post more soon. Recently I added RSS feeds to all of the city/destination and hotel pages on DealBase . This is just one more way for you to keep up to date with all the deals we add to the system. Our other primary way, aside from browsing the site of course, is to sign up for personalized alert emails . This lets you follow one or more cities, and set criteria like class of hotel (i.e. you only want to see 4 and 5 star hotels), maximum price, and so on. You can set a schedule for how often you want the emails (once a week, twice a week, daily, etc.). We'll send you up to the best 10 deals that match your criteria. You can also simply subscribe by just supplying your email address and nothing else and we'll set your initial preferences for our top 10 destinations. We'll continue to enhance this alert service, and I'd love to hear any suggestions people have for additions, changes, etc. Development of the alert emails has been interesting. One of the most useful tools throughout has been Litmus ' email testing service. It's pretty slick. They cover quite an array of email clients, both web hosted (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), as well as desktop (Outlook, Apple Mail, Notes, etc.). They also do spam testing. When you begin a test, they supply you an email address specific for that particular test run, and then you just email them the real email you want tested. You can also paste in an email, but I prefer to do the sending approach to as closely mimic the real thing as possible. I have my IRB and various other bits configured to make it a single command to fire off test cases to a Litmus supplied email address, and the whole process works great, and is truly worth Litmus' cost. I started off mentioning RSS, and back to that... The RSS does work differently than the email alerts (obviously), and to some degree the web page. It is like selecting the "Most Recently Posted" sort on a page (see below image). Deals are supplied to the RSS feed as they're posted, just like a blog would do. Just one more way to stay on top of deals. Oh, and don't forget we're on Twitter too. Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch ! [Update: I resolved the Git issue, and have now switched to using Hudson. The advantages of it's in-progress display, ability to more closely monitor and/or kill a build, and my impression of it being more stable, won the day.] After switching our CI server to Integrity, there were a few blips, one of which is that we were hitting swap (memory). Hitting swap is not surprising and I'm surprised it hasn't been a problem sooner, since memory is our #1 battle. I figured if I was going to up the memory on our CI server, I might also try Hudson, as that was the main reason for not trying it previously. The short story is that I tried it, and we're back to Integrity, but I learned some interesting things. The following is both some notes on installation, as well as some reasons why it didn't work out... Installing Hudson Our CI box is a slice at Slicehost, running Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, and I'd just upped it from 256MB RAM to 1GB. Also of note, I've built and install Git 1.6.4 for this system. The following are brief notes on getting Hudson going as it wasn't quite as simple as most folks made it out to be... First, I followed the directions on the Hudson site for installing Hudson from the Ubuntu package . This amounts to adding the package repository, updating apt-get, and then doing: sudo apt-get install hudson This installs all the Java 1.6 stuff you need (and mine seems fine with 64bit Java), and other dependencies. After the install, Hudson is running, on default port 8080. Next up I added a server block/configuration in Nginx for Hudson (and unlinked/removed Integrity). I then went to Hudson in my browser. What I got was an error message about the xstream library. Fixing that was easy, as it turned out: downloaded the latest (1.320 at the time) hudson.war from the Hudson site, and replaced /usr/share/hudson/hudson.war with it. Restarted Hudson, and voila, now it was up and running. Also, Hudson runs as the user "hudson", so I needed to add an SSH key for that user, and then add the public key to GitHub. And, setup a ~hudson/.gitconfig as needed. Finally, as I found later, do a git clone or an SSH to github so that you get past the whole SSH authenticity question when you first SSH to an unknown server. Note, the Hudson user is not an interactive user, i.e. you can't directly login as that user, so to gen the SSH key, you'll need do something like su to root and do, sudo -u hudson ssh-keygen -t dsa . Configuring Hudson Before adding a project, I needed to config some plugins. I went to the Manage page, clicked on Installed, and turned off the Subversion plugin and restarted. Next was going back in to manage plugins, and installing the Git, Github, and Rake plugins, and again restarting. Both restarts showed an Nginx bad gateway error, but simply refreshing got it back (probably just needed more time for Hudson to restart). Then to configure a build, from the main Hudson page after a fresh install, click the "create new jobs" link. In the ensuing form, enter a project name, and select "Build a free-style software project". Next: checked "Discard Old Builds" which then shows you options (so you can put in keep for X days, or X number of builds) Added URL for Github project, http://github.com/yourproject/yourproject Select Git as the SCM, and entered by git@github.com:yourproject/yourproject.git URL for the repository Turned on merge after build option. This will supposedly add tags for the build to your code base and then merge them back in. More on this in a bit. Next I configured the build steps for my project. All I really did here was take the same build steps I used for Integrity , and added them as individual shell and rake tasks. At this point, I fired off a build (truth be told, I started with just a single build step to vet it), and things worked, with the exception of the very last step, where I push the Git tags back to GitHub. This is what I saw: [workspace] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/hudson1444107192962944065.sh + /usr/bin/git push --tags XML error: syntax error error: Error: no DAV locking support on https://github.com/dealbase/dealbase/ error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dealbase/dealbase' I've now been searching for answers to this, and haven't yielded anything. I've tried the git push directly from a shell, with the same result. If I do this as a different user (e.g. under my user) it works fine. This git push is attempted both as part of a rake task (the ci_tag task), as well as I tried making it just a straight shell command in Hudson. After a lot of googling, and asking, and no resolution in sight, I've gone back to Integrity... Comparisons and Notes First off, I think Hudson looks pretty stellar. There are a TON of plugins for it, and it seems quite mature and polished. The essentially 100% configuration via the GUI is slick. Install, despite a few hoops above, was actually pretty painless. So, here's just a few notes/opinions: Hudson You will need some memory to run Hudson, more than with Integrity or CruiseControl.rb. From what I can tell, you probably want a system with 1GB or more. Various other folks I talked to all had 2GB or more systems, and their Hudson processes were taking 1.5GB or more. This is partly just a Java thing. It should be noted, the others were running more than one build with Hudson, and mine seemed to work fine on a 1GB total memory system (didn't seem to hit swap). Hudson allows you to kill a build while it's running (nice!). Hudson works with CCMenu/CCTray out of the box. The git integration has more options in terms of picking branches, doing merging, and various more involved operations, but doesn't have GitHub post-receive hook support out of the box (there are plugins up on GitHub for it, but not listed in the standard plugin list). Hudson runs as user "hudson", which is a user that has no shell. You could change this, although the idea is you shouldn't have to. However, this complicates setting up SSH keys and various things. And, of course, I had the issue with Git as mentioned above. I could probably change this to run as my user and so on, but part of all this for me is not having to change a lot of defaults and start messing with core configurations/designs of the system. In part, I just don't have time to do that, and to maintain it (these kinds of changes often cause problems when you upgrade versions, etc. - also known as you may forget to redo these changes if an upgrade undoes them :). The UI and web app itself is quite nice, understandable, well done in general for something like this. Also, thanks to the Tea-Driven blog for motivating me to try Hudson (and for some tips on Testjour - more on that in another post). Integrity I really only have one main complaint about Integrity, and that has to do with indication of a build in progress. It essentially doesn't indicate it - it says it hasn't been built yet, but a build may actually be running. The CCMenu/integritray plugin will show you that a build is running, so this mostly solves my problem, but this seems like a core failure. I may have to look at fixing this. And that is a win for Integrity in that it's Ruby, and thus I'll be more apt to go fix this (while I spent MANY years doing heavy Java work, I don't have interest in working in that code anymore for a task like this). CruiseControl.rb One thing that remains an advantage for CC.rb is that it has "build artifacts" - i.e. you can create files and such as part of your build and have those known to CC.rb, where it then links to them in the summary of your build. You may or may not need it, but it's also very handy for simply showing you the Git tag you created on a successful build. I just touch a file in the build artifacts dir with the name of the Git tag, and then I don't have to dig through the output of the build to find my Git tag. That's all the time I have for today, hopefully this is also helpful to others... Recently I switched the DealBase continuous integration server to use Integrity instead of CruiseControl.rb. This happened because I'd been having some sporadic failures under CC.rb that didn't seem explainable (no code would change, and tests would fail at random), and also due to some changes in Cucumber between versions, it all conspired to switch. It should be noted that, as you might guess, the "random" failures were not exactly random, but suffice it to say that the root cause re-inforced my notion to switch. My main beef with CC.rb has more to do with it being somewhat in bed with Rake and wanting to run your CI build via a rake task, and some of the issues (or impurities?) that come up with that. But I'm boring you... Anyway, Integrity... Setup is relatively easy, and is covered fairly well on their setup page/docs . But the following is what I did, which I'm documenting for myself and anyone else who may find it useful. I setup my server to use with Nginx and Passenger. I tried using Integrity with Nginx and Thin, but wasn't able to get Integrity to work right (similar to the results defunkt had when they tried it at GitHub ). We've standardized on Nginx+Passenger, so this was good anyway. I nuked the Nginx I had already and proceeded (all this being done on an Ubuntu Hardy VPS system at Slicehost): sudo gem install passenger sudo passenger-install-nginx-module I let it install Nginx, and picked the default location. I then re-added our HTTP Basic Authentication and a few other Nginx tweaks as I had in the prior Nginx configuration. Next up was to install some prerequisites and Integrity itself: sudo apt-get sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev sudo gem install integrity do_sqlite3 thin integrity install /home/ci/integrity --passenger cd integrity Next you'll want to tweak config.yml to customize the domain where you'll access your CI server. I left the rest the same. Then setup Integrity's database: integrity migrate_db /home/ci/integrity/config.yml I also added the "integritray" plugin, so that I could continue to use CCMenu to monitor my builds. See the integritray GitHub page for simple install. Now point Nginx/Passenger at your install, by adding the appropriate server block for a Passenger Rails app, such as: server { listen 80; server_name your.ciserver.com; root /home/ci/integrity/public; passenger_enabled on; auth_basic "Restricted"; auth_basic_user_file /opt/nginx/conf/htpasswd; } Finally, fire up Nginx, and surf to your CI server domain/URL. You should see something like this: Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch ! Click the "create your first project" link, and enter details about your app. The "Git repository" field should get your GitHub or other git server URL (e.g. your clone URL). For a build script, the following is what I used: rake log:clear && RAILS_ENV=test rake db:reset && spec --options spec/spec.opts spec/--/-_spec.rb && RAILS_ENV=cucumber rake db:reset && cucumber --strict -q --format pretty features && rake ci_tag This is one nice thing about Integrity - it's pretty much any command you can give it. Sure, you might want to wrap that up in a Rake task, or a shell script or however you want to do it. I just entered that raw so it's overly obvious exactly what it's doing. I also found this to work better than doing it as a Rake task, as somehow I wasn't getting the environment to switch properly under Rake. The "ci_tag" rake task is my task for tagging/labeling succesful builds in Git, etc. Next, you'll want to setup a post-commit service hook on GitHub. You can get your Push URL by clicking the edit link for your project in Integiry: Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch ! Note, that works even with HTTP Basic Auth, just add your user credentials to the Push URL before pasting it in on GitHub. Finally, fire off a build. And note, one downside of Integrity is that it doesn't indicate (in the web UI) that a build is underway. It just says it hasn't been built yet. The integritray item and thus CCMenu will show you that it's building though. Lastly... some have asked why not XYZ CI server? A few notes on this: Hudson: this looks awesome, but also somewhat overkill for our needs. I have one project to build, and I'm doing it on a very inexpensive slice that has only 256MB of RAM - I doubt I could even start Hudson in that little RAM, being it's a Java web app, etc. Secondarily, I'd prefer to have the app be Ruby so I can hack on it (I've made at least very minor tweaks to every CI server I've used to date). cruisecontrol.rb - this is what we were using, and it worked well, with minor exception to some random failures and the Rake-oriented build process. I'd really say this is minor though, and would suggest folks try it out. You can of course refer to my previous writeup on setting up CruiseControl.rb :) CI Joe/cijoe - this is actually what I started with when I looked at exploring alternatives. I had problems getting the build working properly, which seems odd. In hindsight that may have wound up being due to some problems during our switch to a newer version of Cucumber. But, one thing I didn't like is that there is no state maintained, so if you stop and start cijoe, it loses track of all its previous builds. This may or may not matter much to you, but I didn't like that. I also didn't want to spend time writing notifiers/CCMenu integration type stuff for our needs. I will ay that cijoe setup/install is pretty cool. Run Code Run doesn't have a viable plan for us yet, plus I've heard having it run custom rake tasks and such doesn't work (wrong?). Furthermore, I didn't really want our private code on their servers and didn't see a need to outsource this. others... either hadn't heard of them, they didn't work well with Rails, or whatever - upshot, Integrity worked, got it up and running fairly fast, and didn't need to spend any more time on this. A little bit ago, I went back to using multiple computers again. For a while I'd just done everything with a MacBook Pro, which was nice - only a single machine to maintain, always had everything in one spot. But alas, twas time for more performance, so I got a Mac Pro, which is now my primary work machine
 with the laptop relegated to basically iCal and Things for the bulk of the day (as my 3rd monitor), and then any portable needs, or working on the couch or deck, etc. Anyway, my main thing against multiple machines, after having spent many years with anywhere between 2 and 5 machines (mostly while working for Adobe), was the maintenance and synchronization of those machines. So, now that I'm back to 2, I am back to wanting/needing my data on whatever computer I'm using. These days this also really extends to my iPhone to some degree as well. It's my truly portable computer. So, with all the "cloud" computing/services these days, this is to some degree easier. I'm not that big a fan of Google having all my data, but I will use the services that are the best in class, or best for my needs, and no doubt some of that is Google, but there are many others. I have not gotten all my data truly available on all the computers I want it on, or as well as I'd like yet, but I'm getting closer. Also, I agree with Al3x in that if the data is important, only having it on a free cloud service is not wise. I haven't fully followed that, but that is part of my plan. Here's some notes on what I've done so far... Email This one is easy. I use Gmail for all my email accounts (about 15 if you count across various domains and so on). Right off, this is one case where this is the only place my data/email lives, so I'm only solving the accessible from anywhere issue. But, I'm also of the mind that I could pretty much lose all my email and be fine. If there are truly important things in it, that data tends to wind up getting put in somewhere else (EverNote, etc., see below) as appropriate. Gmail is so much better than any other Email. I even use it for some non-traditional things, like all our recipes are stored in a Gmail account. Makes it easy to trade recipes amongst friends and family, great for searching, and again, I can get to it from anywhere I can access the web. Further, I use MailPlane as my actual mail client. It is a very rare day that I use a web browser to view Gmail. On the iPhone I just use the regular iPhone mail client, which has some drawbacks, but for my needs is ok. Notes and Misc Data This is the place that recently changed and has become an outstanding solution. I used to use 37signals Backpack , but now use EverNote . EverNote is really quite amazing. I hadn't noticed the Notebooks before, and that's been a great feature for me to do high level organization. Then, the searching is quite good (and of course Backpack essentially didn't even have searching). But, what really swung this over was their desktop client, web storage, and then iPhone client. This gives me great desktop performance, but then access from any web browser, as well as iPhone, AND I get the data stored locally and off-site (i.e. on the web). Furthermore, it sync's across computers. So, I feel like the data I have here is very safe (since it's in at least 3 places). Even better, this allowed me to stop paying for Backpack (my use of EverNote is nowhere close to their paid account). I don't mind paying for software at all, but I had felt that I wasn't getting the solution I wanted from Backpack, so didn't want to pay for that any longer. Code GitHub and Git. Do I need to say more? Bookmarks Two things here: .Mac and Delicious. I use Safari as my primary browser, and leverage it's Bookmark Bar for common stuff, so sync that across machines and iPhone with .Mac. Delicious gets all the other bookmarks. RSS/News Feeds Another recent change was to stop using NetNewsWire which I've used forever, and switch to Google Reader. Specifically what made this work well was creating a Fluid app with the Helvetireader styling. NNW had sync via NewsGator, but it really just didn't work well. It didn't seem to keep the list of feeds in sync, and then it's sync during feed download just didn't seem to cut it. So now, with the fluid app, and then just plain Reader (via browser) on the iPhone seems to solve this all nicely. Documents So far this is a mix of using DropBox and Google Docs. DropBox is awesome for keeping files in sync across machines, and then also available on the web. I've been ramping up my use of DropBox. Things that Aren't sufficiently solved yet Calendar and Address Book Update: I'm now using .Mac to sync Address Book, seems to work great. I'm using iCal and Address Book. Primarily this is due to the super easy sync with the iPhone. I can sync two computers with BusySync or some other things, but haven't seen a great solution yet, as well as haven't investigated that much. Even with .mac I think you still have to have a primary calendar and you're publishing to the other, etc. I've used Google Calendar in the past, but didn't like it that much, and part of all this is ensuring sync is brain dead easy and solid. My wife and I sync calendars with BusySync, but that has been spotty. The various Google/iCal sync things I've tried have been iffy in the past. And, the real key is, how well will it sync Google cal to the iPhone calendar? An area I need to learn more about. Address Book, not sure of my options here either. Sync's nicely with iPhone, and .Mac so far. Music and Photos I've yet to see an iTunes sync thing that works really well. We tried TuneRanger but it was not good when dealing with two existing libraries. Also, we have a lot of music, so keeping it backed up on S3 or similar actually starts to cost real money. Of course these days, the primary need for this is to sync to my iPhone. Most of the time at home I'm listening to Pandora or some similar thing. I use Pandora a lot on the iPhone, but I also listen to various podcasts, and then there are times when Pandora isn't feasible (crappy/no signal, or I'm needing to use another app on the phone while listening to music). These same issues hold true for photos/Lightroom libraries. With Lightroom so far, for each calendar year, I have a Lightroom catalog, and then at the end of those years, I burn DVD's with the photos. Of course, the DVD's are just sitting in our house right now, not in a safe deposit box, etc. (we used to do that, but haven't since we moved to Oregon - lazy). But my bigger concern here is that I'd like my Lightroom library to stay in sync across my two machines, so I can use the burly Mac Pro when working at home, but then have my MBP when on the road. I guess that's it for now. What solutions do you like? What are people doing for large data (GB's or TB's of music, photos, video, etc.)? At DealBase , we've been testing Nginx with Passenger , and have mostly had good results. There are two issues that have come up, hopefully only one of which may broadly affect others. The first issue, which likely affects anyone using this, is that it appears that if you combine and cache CSS or JavaScript via tags like this in Rails: &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag :standard, :cache => 'standard' %&gt; &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :jquery, :cache => 'jquery_all' %&gt; The ":standard" and ":jquery" symbols are expansion symbols for multiple CSS/JavaScript files defined in a Rails initializer. On the first request Rails gets, it's supposed to combine all the files as per the expansion symbol definition, and then produce a "cache" file, so you have a single file that is included in your HTML. This worked fine for us under Mongrel, but it didn't seem to regenerate under Passenger after doing a deploy, even with a restart to Passenger. We had to do a second restart of Passenger, and then hit the server at least twice, if not more to see it get picked up. Thanks to a tip from Engine Yard, one solution can be found on the overstimulate blog , where they detail how you can add a rake task that you call during deploy to regenerate those cache files. This is really even a nicer solution under Mongrel and others, as it will mean it doesn't occur during your first request. The second problem seems confined to my MacBook Pro laptop (no problem on my MacPro tower). That is, I simply cannot get Nginx+Passenger to work. It installs fine, Nginx runs, but I get some odd permissions problem from Passenger: 2009/05/12 11:57:52 [alert] 19611#0: could not create /var/folders/7m/7m7ezMSTHdiBHz5bzVyNDE+++TI/-Tmp-//passenger.19596/control_process.pid (13: Permission denied) 2009/05/12 12:01:19 [crit] 19611#0: -1 connect() to unix:/var/folders/7m/7m7ezMSTHdiBHz5bzVyNDE+++TI/-Tmp-//passenger.19596/master/helper_server.sock failed (13: Permission denied) while connecting to upstream, client: 127.0.0.1, server: dealbase.dev, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "unix:/var/folders/7m/7m7ezMSTHdiBHz5bzVyNDE+++TI/-Tmp-//passenger.19596/master/helper_server.sock:", host: "dealbase.dev" The first line of those two lines occurs when I start Nginx. The second happens when I try to surf to a page from my app in my browser (which makes sense given the first error :) If anyone has any suggestions on this one, let me know!

There's been a couple cool writeups/solutions to deploying your crontab files when you deploy with Capistrano, which I think is great. I can't find the first one I saw (mention in comments and I'll update), but on GitHub, javan has the whenever gem that is really more about allowing you to define crontabs with Ruby/Rails' time methods so you don't have to remember the crontab file syntax which none of us ever seems to be able to remember. You can of course integrate this with Capistrano (and that's covered in his Readme). The point of all this: no more having to remember to go put in or uncomment a crontab entry once you deploy a certain build, and keeping your crontabs under version control. However, for us, none of the solutions out there worked quite right, and I just use what I find to be a simpler setup. First, we have multiple servers with different crontabs per server. Also, we have some environment variables that get defined within the crontab so that they work properly on our Engine Yard slices. I just found that, while yes, I sometimes don't remember all the crontab syntax perfectly, I also don't do this often enough for that to be an issue, and would rather just have the real deal right there, so I knew exactly what I was going to install on my server. Lastly, I didn't really want to have yet another gem dependency for something pretty straight forward like this (IMHO). So, get on with it you say, what's the solution? Two pieces. First, I create a crontab directory within my Rails app's config directory. In that I store crontab files named by the hostname of the server - the same thing you'd get by doing a hostname on the server. You could add an extension or whatever you want, but the hostname is what makes this work easily, so you want that somewhere in your file naming convention. We only have a couple servers and I know them well, so I just went with pure hostname for now. The contents of each file are exactly what you'd see in the crontab file on the server, for the user you set it up under. Second, a simple Capistrano task to affect the given crontab file on the server, with an after hook to run it: task :write_crontab, :roles => :app do puts "Installing server-specific crontab." run("cd #{deploy_to}/current/config/crontab; crontab `hostname`") end after "deploy:restart", "write_crontab" That's it. You can obviously tweek this for your own setup, for example, maybe you need to run it on all roles, or different roles, or what not. Your run command might need to be more robust (or run a shell script or rake task) for example if not all servers have crontabs or you have something more dynamic. But, as you can tell, setting this kind of thing up is pretty straight forward, and it's great to keep your crontab setups in version control. Thanks to you guys that stimulated the idea in the first place. Recently we ran into an interesting performance issue with MySQL. We have an automated process we run at night a few nights a week that does data harvesting for hotel rates and such. This data is versioned so that we can look at historical values. However, this script had begun to really crawl. Originally it took a couple hours to run. But it had gotten to the point where it could take almost a day. I tracked this down to being a SQL MAX call used by acts_as_versioned to determine the next version for one of these records. The problem is that it had to sift through nearly 10 million records. In testing this on my local machine, just one of these SQL queries could take 45 seconds! Think about doing this across oh say 100,000 hotels, ya, not good. The good folks at GitHub ran into this same thing (with a table of 36M records) on nearly the same day. Their approach is similar to the approach I'll be taking on another table (which isn't currently affecting us this way, but will have different benefits), which was to split it into two tables, one with older data. I could have done this, and would have, but the reality was that we simply didn't need to keep these versions, as we weren't using the data. So, luckily, I was able to just no longer version this particular model, and throw out that table. After doing that, I ran the script and it took just over an hour. Yea! So, this is something to note if you use acts_as_versioned with models that have frequent changes and a decent number of those models to begin with (think multipliers). One of the things I'll be looking into in the future is whether that MAX needs to get done, or whether acts_as_versioned can be smarter about how it does it. On first glance you'd think you could just use the version number on the original model itself, but that number isn't guaranteed to be the latest number, since you can rollback versions and so on.
You may remember the problems that we've been having with our persistent cache, memcacheDB . Our initial response was to add a bunch more RAM to the system, which would probably only last us a few weeks, until we could put a better solution in place. Fortunately with EC2 we were able to spin up five new machines with gobs of RAM to fill that temporary role. After that, we dedicated 33% of our development team (i.e. me) to swapping it out for a more scalable and long-term backend. As of this morning we're now running with our persistent cache backed by Cassandra . The migration was seamless (did you notice?), but the load-impact on our servers is palpable. In case you are wondering why we chose Cassandra: it is way faster, more scalable, and has a rich and active development community full of extremely smart and helpful people. It's in use or going to be in use by several large companies ( Twitter , Facebook , digg , Rackspace). We have the ability to add nodes as load and storage requires, and we have the ability to move non-cache type data into it as appropriate. We could not have done this in just 10 days without the help of the amazing Cassandra developers and community and EC2, which allowed us to bring up new instances on which to test and ultimately deploy Cassandra. I cannot thank the extremely intelligent Cassandra developers and community enough for their work and their help! Photo credit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Solomon_Ajax_and_Cassandra.jpg A - Normal daily reddit traffic B - Yesterday's actual traffic C - What it felt like to us As some of you may have noticed , reddit has been a tad slow lately. Last night, we put in a fix that will hopefully fix the problem in the short term until we can get a longer term fix in place. We wanted to take this opportunity to fill you in on what caused the problem, how we are fixing it, and dispel some myths. In short, we made a technical decision a few years ago that was a good idea at the time, but which is becoming increasingly hard to scale. We need to make some deep changes to fix it, but we put in a band-aid solution of adding more memory for reddit to use in the meantime. But before we get too far down the technical rabbit hole, while the four of us were busy trying to stop the site from melting any further, other things were happening that we didn't get a chance to address. At the end of the day, reddit is both a community and social news site, bound to attract people in the social news business. We have always been about serving up interesting stories and content, all the while trying to ensure that we curb any abuse of the community's good graces. If you like what you see on reddit, good, upvote it. If not, complain , or even make your own community . Above all, if you think someone is abusing the site, tell us . A witch hunt and a glut of personal details degrades us all. Posting personal information crosses the line, and it has been our policy since the beginning to remove it when we see it or when it is pointed out to us. That said, we are not all-seeing. We don't have a program that detects personal information and notifies us. While we removed personal info (per our terms of service) when it was shown to us, we obviously didn't get it all. What happened this weekend saddened us. Saydrah's postings have been additive to the community, and we have no indication that she's been anything but a great moderator to the communities she moderates. Moderators are not exempt from our anti-cheating measures, and, though I hate to have to put it in these terms, we've "investigated" Saydrah, and we didn't find any indication of her cheating or otherwise abusing power. Nerd talk starts here TL;DR: oh hi i upgraded your RAM Myths : The recent site problems are because reddit moved to EC2 -- False The only reason we were able to fix this at all is because we are on EC2 and were able to quickly spin up new instances. In fact, we just had to do it again this morning because we needed even more RAM. But I swear it's been slow since you moved to EC2! -- False We moved to EC2 in May 2009. We only started getting reports of slowness about three weeks ago, which we could also see in our logs and monitoring. The number of reports got worse as time went on, but we didn't see it ourselves, so it was hard to track down a specific cause. reddit is just text, so you guys are clearly morons -- False While reddit is just text when it leaves our servers, there is a whole lot going on under the hood. It is a highly customized user experience, on par with something like Facebook (just not as many users). We do 100's of transactions every second. While we may be doing some things wrong, it's a lot more than just 'select - from comments where article = "foo"' Let's start at the beginning. Here is a simplified version of reddit's architecture: The area where we are having trouble right now is that purple section in the middle that says "memcaches". Specifically, we are having problems with memcachedb, which is where we store a bunch of precomputed listings, like all the listing pages, profile pages, inboxes; pretty much any list on reddit that is too expensive to calculate on the fly. A few years ago, we decided to md5 all of our cache keys. We did this because at the time memcached (which is what memcachedb is based on) could only take keys of a certain length. In fact, the version it is based on still has this limitation. MD5ing the keys was a good solution to this problem, so we thought. It turns out that this one little decision makes it so that we can't horizontally scale that layer of our architecture without losing all the data already there (because all of the keys would point to the wrong server if we added a new one). While we could recalculate all the data, it would take weeks to do so. And that is in fact what we will be doing. Memcachedb has served us well, but it is getting old. It can no longer return data fast enough for our needs, due to the way it interacts with BDb (its underlying data store). We will soon be picking a new data store to replace memcachedb and recalculating all of the data for it, most likely by adding the new cache into the cache chain, and then recalculating what is left after a few weeks. But in the mean time, what we have done is spin up 5 new instances to run memcached. This allowed us to expand the size of the memcache in front of memcachedb to 6GB (up from 2GB). Right now, this means that about 94% of each database is in RAM. As our site grows, this fix will fail us, but hopefully it buys us enough time until we can replace the data store. As usual, if you want to tell us why we suck at our jobs, feel free to leave some comments on this post. One of the main problems with our request to "message a moderator" when you have a problem on a given reddit has been that it is completely opaque as to which moderator to message. Much lore has been generated on many reddits as to who is the "good" or the "responsive" moderator, and many messages have fallen to the wayside by choosing unwisely. By the same token, it is unfair to the moderators that they are unable to see over what may very well be community-wide issues. To mitigate both of these, we've created a separate moderator inbox for each reddit which can be messaged by composing a PM to "# redditname " (with the hashmark stolen from IRC parlance). So, for now on, to reach the admin's box, send a message to "#reddit.com" and we'll get back to you. For other reddits, we've added a handy link to the moderator box. From a moderator's viewpoint, we've make a UI tweak to differentiate your moderator inbox from your regular inbox: And a new orangered alien for when you have moderator mail: Clicking on the alien will bring you to your moderation inbox. In this view, you'll see the messages to all of the reddits you moderate organized with the newest on top. Clicking on the name of the reddit (in the blue bubble on the top left) will bring you to a view that shows messages for that reddit alone. This view is also accessible from the "moderator toolbox" on each of your reddits. One thing to note in responding to these messages: when you participate on a message thread initiated by a user, everything in the conversation will be sent back to the user as an implicit CC. tldr : Don't message one moderator, message all moderators. In pursuit of making reddit easier to use, we've added the ability to get private RSS feeds to parts of the site that would normally require you to log in. The new set of feeds is available thru your preference page , and is available (currently) in both RSS and JSON. [If you are worried about the security of this, we've added a preference to disable it, and set it up so that all feeds will be invalidated once you change your password.] The first example of its use is the front page: we want you to be able to customize your subscriptions to different reddits, but up until now there was no way to get a feed of your personalized front page without passing us your login cookie. This is sometimes handled gracefully by browsers, but seldom by other feed readers. By the same method, we're also generating RSS links for your saved, liked, disliked and hidden pages, as well as to get the contents of your inbox (even your unread tab). And for the moderators in the audience: you'll now find that both the spam and reported listings of your reddits have RSS available. In this case, though, you'll find the feed on the page in question rather than on your preference page. This should make it much easier to keep dibs on what is making its way onto your reddit's spam pages. We've also fixed a bug on those listings that was breaking hiding of links, so moderators will now have the capacity (at least individually) to clear out their spam listing. So, about 8 hours after we put up new markdown rendering engine , our call to find exploits was a complete success, and here is the new white-hat who found it. Besides discovering a bug in the way that discount dealt with escaped quotes in certain places (with thanks to David Parsons of Discount for getting out a patch so quickly), we learned that we should probably set up some guidelines for how to report exploits to us. So, we created a wiki page on help . For those of you who don't know the details of how the infamous worm spread on reddit 5 months ago, here's the short story: a bunch of white-hats created a reddit where they tried to create a proof-of-principle worm that would append itself as a reply to all of the comments in a given page. The whole thing was contained to a shared comment thread, and all of the testing was contained to that thread...until one of the users went to their inbox. You see, the replying JS is common in both areas, so an exploit that works on a comment thread works in your inbox. Your inbox, though, has, in principle, comments from all sorts of other comment threads from all over the site. The result was that the worm got out and was allowed to spread freely until we took down (and later patched) the markdown renderer. The lesson and tldr: please don't post or test for exploits in any shared or public areas. PM us and then make sure your work is well hidden. Once the genie is out, it's hard for us to re-cork it. As most of you know, reddit's commenting system uses a technology called Markdown that allows you to type stuff like: My [site](http://something.com) is -really- cool. ...and have it rendered as: My site is really cool. We get so many comments (and comment-viewings) per second that doing this translation has always been a major burden on our servers. The more CPU cycles we spend on it, the more application servers we need, and in turn the more connections going to our database servers, the more places we have to roll code out to, and all sorts of other growth problems. But you shouldn't feel one ten-thousandth of a guilt unit over this news, because we've just switched our rendering engine from markdown.py (which is nothing to sneeze at and has served us well since the beginning) to a 100%-compatible, pure-C implementation of Markdown known as Discount . (Get it?) In our tests, Discount is fifteen times faster than markdown.py, which should allow us to reclaim some of our computing power and devote it to other areas of the site that are struggling. If you happen to be the sort of person who can't resist looking for security holes in any new technology, and you come across one here, please let us know quietly, rather than choosing to announce your finding in the form of a worm which takes out the entire site . DO NOT SHARE YOUR EXPLOIT WITH ANYONE ELSE. I promise that we'll immediately get to work on the problem as soon as you tell us, and once it's fixed, we'll give you full credit ... as well as the special new ultra-rare "White Hat" trophy. We're also retroactively giving it to previous responsible disclosers chromakode and notrael . The aptly-named javascriptinjection , who wrote and accidentally released the aforementioned worm, will get one too, but only because he immediately got in touch with us as soon as he realized what he had done, then later found a second vulnerability and reported that one the nice way. Hats off to our winners! tl;dr: If you see any wonky comments, tell us . P.S. Special thanks to David Parsons, who is the author and maintainer of Discount and has just been an all-around great guy with respect to this big change. He patiently and quickly answered my endless stream of questions about his code, and even added features to the library that we would have otherwise had to hack in ourselves as a patch. Check out his website , too; it includes photos of his casemod projects and detailed visual archives of some amateur experiments in the field of recombinant DNA research. It was a hell of a day for reddit's Engineering team. 25% of the department (i.e., Chris ) was in New York on Conde Nast business -- I imagine him smoking cigars with bigwigs while everyone's riding polo horses. The rest of us ( David , Jeremy , and me) were preparing for a road trip to the Googleplex to videotape the Peter Norvig AMA . Right when our trio was getting ready to hit the road, news broke that some reddit users were seeing a pop-up ad right smack in the middle of our site. This was a surprise to us, and wasn't even supposed to be possible, but we had an appointment to get to, so we pulled Chris away from, I presume, the squash court to handle things. I'll pass the mic to him to explain how it went: So, honestly, the first thing I thought when I saw that post on the front page was, "oh &#-% . I'm going to have to bludgeon myself to death with my own keyboard, because if I don't someone is going to remind me that I said I would " About half a second later I thought, "well, I'm doomed, but I can at least save the site from further abuse," so I shut off all site-wide ads post haste and hoped that this would give us a chance to figure out what had happened. Soon after, we figured out that this was what we will refer to as a "whoopsie" on the part of our ad systems, and that we had accidentally started running ads from another of our parent company's sites (yes, that's what advertising looks like on other parts of the internet. It is considered "normal". Please buy a T-shirt ...!) The issue was fixed before we had noticed it, but the damage was done. We've decided internally that the best possible fix for this will be to run the ad unit from an &lt;iframe&gt; on a separate domain which will prevent it from busting out by browser security rules (kind of like what we do currently on video embeds). There was nothing malicious involved. This was, apparently, a "feature" of that ad campaign, though it was not intended for us. This was all done in the bit of time I had between meetings. [Oh, and before I forget, don't believe what your manservant tells you: polo is overrated.] Mike here again. Meanwhile, back in Mountain View, the rest of the team had met up with Peter and, after a terrific lunch on Google's dime, grabbed a conference room and began the interview. As Murphy's Law would have it, the site starting acting funny right around the time Jeremy pressed Record. We noticed that our silenced phones seemed to be vibrating a lot more than usual, and so David an
 I quietly checked things out as best we could while Jeremy ran the show. (When we post the video, you may notice the sound of some frantic off-camera typing.) As soon as the taping was finished, we started discussing the anomaly. Within a minute or two of us flipping our ringers back on, all of our phones started simultaneously making the "reddit is in -really- big trouble" noise. The site was down; we didn't even have time to give our hosts a proper goodbye, but instead asked if we could sit in the parking lot and mooch some more WiFi. Google's hospitality, however, was exemplary: they invited us to sit on couches in their lobby for as long as we wanted and help ourselves to all the WiFi we needed. We set up an emergency base of operations next to the reception desk and got Chris on the horn as well. David and Jeremy had brought their laptops along, but mine was 45 minutes away back at reddit HQ, so I had to commandeer one from a generous passerby. (You know who you are. Thanks!) After an hour of rushed coast-to-coast debugging, we had patched things up well enough to survive the trip home. It had been an exciting day, and the Googleplex is every bit the nerd utopia it's reported to be. It's the sort of place where one can leave a laptop sitting on the floor unattended and know that not only is it perfectly safe, but that nobody's going to bat an eyelash over it.

It's been a long time and I'm proud to say, I'm back writing again! Finally managed to catch a match proper, on a weekday at an ungodly hour of 4am. Liverpool up against Arsenal, who've slumped to defeats at the hands of Man United and Chelsea. And their respond to the defeats came just in time. On a night when Man Utd drew and Chelsea lost. In a surprising turn of event, Arsenal managed to claw their way back into title contention while Liverpool could only watch as the top three teams surging further and further away from them. After a good run of results including 6 clean sheets in 7, a game at the Emirates still proved to be a challenged. The Reds have an abysmal record against Arsenal whether is it a home or away game and just the mention of 'Andrei Arshavin' would have many of you cringing already. Once again, another visit to the Emirates and another empty handed trip down south. A lapse of concentration from Liverpool's defence was enough to give Arsenal the win. At the highest level of football, that was all that is required. A mistake and a reaction that is milliseconds slow. Tomas Rosicky was able to provide after a good move down the right and his cross was met by an unmarked Abou Diaby in the 75th minute. He rose unchallenged in the Liverpool penalty box after evading some slack marking from substitute, Philipp Degen. The Swiss, honestly, doesn't impress me at all for the longest of time. He replaced Jamie Carragher midway through the second half and there I thought 'Oh no, disaster waiting to happen'. Sure it did. He's not the fastest and prone to some niggly fouls throughout. He's constantly out of position due to his 'attacking' sense and 'just-run-forward' mentality. There was an occasion where Liverpool was nearly punished due to him running blindly forward leaving a huge gap behind. Well let's be honest, Degen wasn't the only one who was bad. I guess I'm still not impressed with the performance of Maxi Rodriguez but I shall give him a benefit of a doubt due to his recent arrival and the need for him to acclimatise and familiarise himself with the team. David N'gog proved to be a spectator throughout and when he's called into action during that one-on-one situation, he panicked and William Gallas was able to make a last ditch tackle. That was probably Liverpool's best chance. Steven Gerrard, though posed some threat but wasn't able to impose himself. His attitude didn't help either. Don't know if it's me or he just struts around expecting perfect passes for him. One stray pass and he just flings his arms with disappointment like a kid with his toys taken away from him. To be honest, a draw will be a fair enough result as both teams didn't look threatening at all and were not at their best. But Arsenal was able to compound on the slip-up in Liverpool's defence and made them pay. Who said Arsenal weren't clinical? This was a show of them playing not as beautifully as they always do and yet still win. Written by Gareth Freeman, a sports writer promoting Irish racing and racing tips for today.&nbsp; Tuesday night’s win over Aston Villa may not have been the best game of football ever played but on that particular night the result was all that counted. Neither side played particularly well and the closest we came to a goal in normal time was probably a couple of penalty shouts that were waved away. However, deep into stoppage time Fernando Torres popped up with a crucial goal and wrote himself into Liverpool folklore. His 50th Premier League goal saw him become the fastest player in the Reds history to reach that mark in the Premier League (72 games) and gave Rafael Benitz and co a massive boost in terms of a Champions League place. The festive period overall was a decent time for Benitez. The loss to Pompey was as upsetting as it was shocking but since then Liverpool have recorded back to back wins over Villa and Wolves and have closed the gap at the top. The Reds now lie four points adrift of Tottenham in fourth, who are the next league opponents on January 10. Following the victory over Villa the game against Spurs is now massive and Liverpool have a great opportunity to push on and break into the Champions League places. Another bonus has been the emergence of Alberto Aquilani. The Italian has now played in the last two games and against Wolves especially looked a quality player. He perhaps hasn’t set the world on fire just yet but it can take time to settle into the Premier League and with time he could be a massive boost for Liverpool’s European hopes. Steven Gerrard has had his fair share of criticism so far this season but he did put in a great display against Wolves. No one, aside from Torres, shone against Villa in all fairness but for a team to play badly and still beat one of their nearest rivals is not necessarily a bad thing. Captain Gerrard believes it will be difficult but remains confident the club can secure a top-four spot. He said: "We've virtually got everyone back fit now so there are no excuses now. We need to go on a run of winning games. "Can we secure a top-four spot? It is going to be difficult. There are a lot of fantastic teams about. I am sure teams will spend in January. "It will be a race to the very end and we've got to make sure we are in it." A possible switch to Barcelona has proved an extremely drawn out transfer saga for Javier Mascherano. I can’t remember exactly when the rumours started but there were rumblings throughout the summer and despite the window closing when the season began it has still hit the news on a fairly regular basis. We’ve been told he has demanded a move, a deal is already in place and that there are no foundations to the rumours at all – so what do we believe? In truth, the speculation doesn’t really matter until the player says something – a factor that has been lacking in this particular saga until now. Masch hasn’t actually said he wants to leave and has stated he is committed to playing well for Liverpool. However, he hardly expresses his desire to stay with the club and his comments are, unfortunately, very ambiguous. "I am playing for Liverpool, I am a Liverpool player and like the manager says I have two more years on my contract and don't have to say anything else," explained Masch. "I play for Liverpool and will continue to do my best." See what I mean? Perhaps I’m being overly negative (I hope so) but to me these are quite worrying comments and he could well be on his way, if not in January perhaps next summer. Should the Argentine decide to depart Anfield it would perhaps not impact as greatly on the club as the loss of Xabi Alonso did. Mascherano is a great combative midfielder and capable of breaking up the opponents play as well as starting moves of his own but it is a role where there are plenty of candidates to replace him. Barcelona’s Yaya Toure could possibly be part of a swap deal and in all honesty I think he is probably a better player. Lucas will have another season under his belt and he is starting to improve. In the Premier League Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole could be a good option should Masch decide to move on. Liverpool’s standing at the end of the season may prove a decisive factor for Mascherano. If the Reds can finish in the top-four or win the FA Cup or Europa League he may opt to stick with Rafael Benitez. The player himself hasn’t given up hope of adding some silverware to his trophy cabinet at the end of the campaign. He added: "It is not a good season, but everything can change and in May we could be talking about Liverpool winning something," Written by Gareth Freeman, a sports writer promoting betting tips and Irish racing . Everton &nbsp; 0 Liverpool &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 (Yobo 12 og, Kuyt 80) Football. Funny old game. You just got to feel for Everton. They got the short end of the stick this time and despite putting in a fairly decent performance and troubled Liverpool well enough, still they slump to a undeserving 2-0 defeat to their bitter city rival. With almost a dozen of players out injured, the patched up Everton side were firmly in control throughout the game and if not for some terrible finishing and Pepe Reina’s miraculous saves, the result could’ve been so different. But I guess that’s what football is about. It’s not the amount of chances. Not how well or how beautiful the link-up plays are. It’s just putting the ball into the back of the net. Everton had the chance but unfortunately, blew it. Liverpool, meanwhile, dared to try and twice they did, twice they scored. Fortunes, sometimes does favour the brave. With Rafa Benitez’s men knocked out of Champions League, the Reds entered this week at all-time low. Everton must’ve thought it’s the perfect time for them to put one past their city rivals. But lady luck decided to shine on Liverpool that particular day. I can’t remember any one with the red jersey actually testing Tim Howard or posed any threats to his goal. But still, he had to pick the ball out of his net twice. Not known for scoring goals, Javier Mascherano tried a low drive which came off Joseph Yobo and Howard had totally no chance. You could tell how important that goal was for Liverpool from the Argentinian’s celebration. He went berserk. And it definitely lifted the away side. &nbsp;But still, Liverpool were very much pinned to their own half and were playing cautiously most of the time. David Ngog, the sole front man, was left isolated up top and had little support. His first derby game was probably a forgettable one as he was out-muscled by Yobo and Heitinga. Steven Gerrard. Less said about him in this game the better. He looked totally out of form and provided zero support for the inexperienced David Ngog. A leader on the pitch in physical sense but I’ve never seen him this subdued for quite a while. Did he miss Torres this much? The Spanish hotshot’s absence meant that Liverpool’s goalscoring threat diminished. Other players have to step up and guess who? It’s always going to be Dirk Kuyt. The Dutch striker, although a little over-enthusiastic sometimes, proves to be a reliable player and no wonder Rafa Benitez values him so much. It was his goal-poaching instincts that brought about the second goal which effectively finished the game off. But before I go into the goal, I must say the introduction of Albert Riera and Yossi Benayoun did change the game in favour of Liverpool. The duo caused problems for the Everton defence, giving the Reds a little more width and creativity. It was the presence of the extra attacker which Everton failed to handle and again, Joseph Yobo blundered, gifting Riera an opportunity to take a pot shot. Howard spilled the ball and Kuyt was at the right place, right time to slot home. Despite not being a spectacle and in fact, a rather uncomfortable match to watch as a Liverpool fan, it was a very, very important win for Liverpool. The team went through a really rough patch recently and the ugly and undeserved win was actually a welcoming one. It will definitely boost the morale and propel them to close and gap and fight for a top 4 finish this season. We’ve been saying nearly every week that whoever the Reds are playing it is a ‘must win’ game and the visit of City to Anfield is as big as any game Liverpool have faced this season. Mark Hughes’ side are one point and one place above Liverpool and a win over the blue half of Manchester would go along way to restoring some faith in Rafael Benitez and his Liverpool squad. The massive bonus for Benitez is the fact that Steven Gerrard has ruled himself fit for the fixture with City. This is what the Liverpool captain has had to say: "I've had a problem in my groin that has taken a while to get over but I'm just relieved the second injection seems to have done the trick. "It's a case of so far so good and the aim now is to make sure I get a good week's training under my belt so I'm ready for the game with City." Great news about Gerrard, but striker Fernando Torres will play no part as he struggles with an abdominal strain. Yossi Benayoun and Albert Riera are also ruled out while Glen Johnson, Daniel Agger and Fabio Aurelio are all doubtful ahead of City’s visit. It remains to be seen whether we’ll get to see Alberto Aquilani or not but with Gerrard back in the fold this is certainly a winnable game for Liverpool. City will be without winger Martin Petrov, while Robinho and Gareth Barry are also listed as doubtful but they have plenty of players to cover and expect a strong line-up. At a guess I would say City will probably line up with Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Teve and Craig Bellamy in attack – a formidable line up to say the least. However, Tevez has never been the most prolific striker in front of goal, Adebayor has suffered a dip in form since his antics against Arsenal and Bellamy can be a bit hit and miss. The game has all the makings of a classic. Liverpool need to win to keep up with the chasing pack at the top of the table, while City have something to prove against the bigger clubs after all their summer spending. I’m not going to hazard a guess at the result as on paper it is a bit close to call, I do think we’re in for a great game though and with home advantage Liverpool should be the favourites. Written by Gareth Freeman, a sports writer promoting horse racing Ireland and the Aintree Grand National 2010 for Betfair. There seems to be almost constant speculation in regards to defensive midfielder Javier Mascherano’s Liverpool future. On what feels like a daily basis a story emerges about a possible transfer to Barcelona with some sections of the media going as far as to state he is certainly heading to Camp Nou in January in a £36million deal. However, Spanish sports publication Sport has today reported that there is no ‘concrete foundation’ to the rumours. The player himself has apparently voiced his dislike of the English lifestyle and climate, but for a player earning so much money and being a regular in the starting eleven at a club like Liverpool surely this is a small price to pay (although, granted the weather is terrible). Unless Mascherano hands in a transfer request then I just can’t see Rafael Benitez selling him. Another point to consider is the World Cup in South Africa next summer. Masch is a regular in the Argentina national side and he will retain his place in Diego Maradona’s midfield as long as he is playing regular first-team football. At Anfield he is pretty much guaranteed a starting place, but a move to Barcelona may see him sat on the sidelines until he has settled into the side and I doubt the 25-year-old would want to put his World Cup spot in jeopardy. Sport have claimed to have been in contact with both Barca and Liverpool, with both denying they have been in contact with regards to the player. If this is true it would seem as if there is no truth in the speculation linking Masch with a move to Camp Nou. There are a couple of other transfer rumours doing the rounds, here is a quick run through them. Carlton Cole : It has been reported that both Liverpool and Manchester United are battling it out to sign West Ham’s Carlton Cole, who is valued at £20million. There could be some truth in this as Liverpool could certainly do with another striker, whether the Hammers would be willing to let him go or not remains to be seen. Ryan Shawcross : Again, United have also been linked with Shawcross but the defender has just agreed a contract extension at Stoke and it seems unlikely he will head to Anfield or Old Trafford anytime soon. Simon Kjaer : This 20-year-old defender has been getting rave reviews for is performances at Serie A side Palmero. However, the club don’t want to sell the Danish stopper and if a move does materialise, it will be next summer. Eljero Elia : Hamburg’s Dutch winger only made the switch to the Bundesliga in the summer but is already attracting interest. Reports suggest the Reds will make a £15million move in January – with Ryan Babel possibly heading the other way. Eduardo : Arsenal striker Eduardo has been linked with a £10million switch to Anfield in January – for me this is just pure speculation and I can’t see this one happening at all to be totally honest.

’s title hopes seemed to have imploded even before the league reaches its quarter mark. It was definitely a depressing view for most fans as the shocking 3-1 lost to Fulham seemed to have marked an end of the road for the Reds and their title ambition. After a morale boosting 2-0 win over Man Utd last week, it looked as though things could only get better as Liverpool endured through a ‘Black October’ with 4 consecutive losses. But by the 80 th minute, Liverpool and Rafael Benitez seemed to have taken this game so lightly that it all seemed like a pre-season friendly or they’ve already won the title. Nathan Ecclestone? Philip Degen? Daniel Ayala? In a Premiership match where so much mattered? Is Rafa having a laugh here? Liverpool’s defence had been undeniably shaky since the start of season and I personally can’t remember the number of times we actually kept a clean sheet. It was the same at Craven Cottage as we saw how Bobby Zamora, albeit not the best striker in the land in any sense, ran rings round a dejected and tired-looking Jamie Carragher. After his heroics last week, Carragher was back to his early season form and it’s no wonder he was sent off for bringing down Zamora. He was outpaced and outsmarted and he had no options. Neither did the referee. But the referee did had a questionable decision when he sent off Philip Degen for a awful looking but non-malicious tackle. It was one of those moments where you’ll turn towards your friends and ask ‘what the heck?’ But referee’s decisions aside, it was an awful, awful game from Liverpool’s point of view. Other than Fernando Torres, who has suddenly turned into Steven Gerrard circa pre-Torres era, the rest cannot be spared from any sort of criticism. What happened to that team that looked so good at Anfield a week ago? Is Liverpool suffering from a post-natal depression of a bipolar disorder. I would go for the latter. With decision to remove goalscorer, Torres, in the 60 odd minutes, the strange bipolar performances of the team could be attributed to Mr. Rafa Benitez himself. Let me make myself clear, I do love this man. But I guess it’s time for him to go. Many more would join me in this bandwagon IF we don’t make it through to the Champions League knockout stage this Wednesday. It is not only a do-or-die match for Liverpool and their European ambition but also it’s his job right there, on the guillotine. Probably things have gone a little stale at Anfield and many are getting impatient. It’s year after year of the same old, except for last season where we finished high up and it smelled like title this season. But the Anfield faithfuls have to endure yet another disappointing and probably, trophy-less season. The over-achievement of last season could’ve been an added pressure on Benitez, a limestone hung around his neck. Added on to these are the miraculous 2005 Champions league win and the 2006 FA Cup. Thereafter, it’s years of wilderness and there seemed no stopping of Liverpool walking further into the desert and hypothetically, could’ve turned into a team that is only motivated enough to beat their fierce rivals. Sounds like Man City before Thaksin? I personally think that there’s no more turning back for Rafael Benitez. Even if Liverpool does triumph over Lyon this coming Wednesday, that probably does not change the fact that there is a huge change needed at Liverpool. I know the club represents and stands for stability, seeing the number of managers actually ‘sacked’ from the club. But I can’t bear to see the club going down this way. I’m not a doomsday merchant or a knee-jerk reactor. I’m just a little jaded and want to see some changes in the club. For now, 5 losses in 11 games. We can realistically count ourselves out of the title race and focus on at least getting into the top 4. If Man City are to maintain this sort of form, it could be quite a challenge and it will be pretty embarrassing to say the least. So what will be Liverpool’s response this Wednesday? I sincerely hope it’s not going to be another limp and half-hearted performance. I really, really hope not… By: Gareth Freeman The result last weekend was undoubtedly a huge one for Rafael Benitez and his Liverpool side. Beating the old enemy and closing the gap between the top sides as vastly important for Liverpool but it will count for very little if they don’t take all three points off Fulham on Saturday. Craven Cottage is often a hard place to go but fingers crossed Steven Gerrard should be back in action and we may finally get too see Italian Alberto Aquilani for the first time in the league. Fulham should not be dismissed though as they have some decent players themselves. Liverpool may be the heavy favourites with the online betting odds , and rightly so, but the Cottagers have the talent to cause an upset. In defence Norwegian Brede Hangeland has established himself as a top class centre-half and is also capable of popping up with a goal or two from set plays. His displays for Fulham have led to interest from the likes of Spurs and Arsenal and he is a difficult man to pass. His defensive colleagues such as Aaron Hughes, Chris Baird and John Panstil are perhaps not of the same standard and there are holes in the Fulham back line. Fulham boss Roy Hodgson has built a very well organised and efficient side at Craven Cottage. In midfield players such as Clint Dempsey and Damien Duff have plenty of quality and on their day they’re capable of competing with anyone – as they showed by coming back from two down to draw with Manchester City. The one area they are lacking a bit of bite in my opinion is in attack. Striker Bobby Zamora has a good all round game, he runs the lines and holds the ball up well but his scoring record is not as impressive as perhaps it should be. He seems to have lost a bit of confidence in front of goal and missed an absolute sitter against City, which was a shame as otherwise he had a really good game. It won’t be a stroll in the park for Liverpool but I wouldn’t bet against them at Fulham. After the great result against Manchester United they should head into this full of confidence, despite their Carling Cup exit. With Gerrard fit again, Torres in form and Aquliani’s league debut imminent the Reds should push on from here and three points at Fulham would go a long way to proving their doubters they can still compete with the best in the league.
For the 7 of you who are still reading this blog, you may have noticed, that i am on hiatus. I'm getting married in less than two weeks, plus Polish girl and i have just closed on a house. So i am very busy, with a little bit of busy added on top of that. This blog is on hold for now and hopefully one day... five, six years from now, I'll get it back up and running again. My mind is still humming and i still have blog entries dancing around my head. Unfortunately, i do not have the time to sit down and write them out in neat blog prose. till we meet again, Historelli This past weekend, Nik Social and I (with several others) aided in the eventual release of a gargoyle. We were guided by master carver Franco Minervini, who showed us how to work limestone on a model of a humanoid griffin. The actual gargoyle sits atop the National Cathedral in Washington, where Master Minervini worked during the late 1980s. Stone carving is the reverse of molding because instead of putting material together to create a figure, you must take bits and pieces away to free a form. Besides the difference in technique, working stone is much more profound and permanent compared to clay or even paint. Not only in the sense that the finished piece will most likely outlast the artist by centuries, but also for the reason that the actual activity of shaping stone is primeval and ancient. Even a beginner (with any sense of geology) can understand the connection. Stone is eternal; working it forces you to contemplate millennia. Furthermore, stone is rough and until coaxed properly, unyielding. A novice will swell his hands, scrape his knuckles and breathe in dust before continuing. And yet, the finished product can be as refined and polished as the finest impressionist painting. I wasn’t sure what I would find before taking this stone carving workshop, I did know that I wanted to better comprehend the craft and how it relates to my own roots. Master Minervini stems from the city of Molfetta, where my parents were also born and were 95% of my known ancestors come from. Minervini’s teacher at the National Cathedral was the late great carver, Vincent Palumbo, a fifth generation master whose family also ran shops in Molfetta. Anyone whose been to Molfetta or even seen a picture of the place would not be surprised by the genesis of stone carvers the city initiates. Comprised of sun-scorched limestone buildings, Molfetta shines with a brightness that beautifully contrasts with the deep blue Adriatic and the surrounding olive groves. Years ago, its inhabitants fished the sea, farmed the land or worked the stone. All of my ancestors survived via these trades, and I believe it is essential to experience these fundamentals in order to be healthy and fulfilled, especially in today’s world of text messaging and reality shows. A little bit of that old-world essence was at hand this past weekend. Working with master Minervini caused limestone dust to fill the air, which then combined with a distant aroma of cooking. I thought to myself, this smells familiar. Shortly after, Nik turned to me quizzically, and said: “It’s weird, but right now it almost smells like Molfetta.” There was this cigar bar lounge called “Retailers,” where I spent entirely way too much time in during my early to mid-twenties. My crew knew all the names of the more sizzling waitresses and they reciprocated our suave by giving us lots of free drinks and more importantly allowing us to stay later than the supposed 4 am closing hour. Several evenings ended with navigations through morning rush hour after episodes of drinking through snifters and swivels. One particular night, my floral friend Cosmo pulled me away from the blond waitress I was working on and asked me if this “guy” he was talking to… "was really him.” Curious, I walked over to the bar, pressed my face into his visage, and came to the conclusion that I was indeed staring at dancer extraordinaire: Patrick Swayze. I turned to Cosmo and replied. “Yeah, that’s him.” Cosmo responded by purchasing shots of the most expensive of tequilas. Now, Johnny Castle was already half-zooted. Apparently, an altercation with his wife had caused him to go on a bender and by the time he got to us, he had already assembled an entourage of young girls, Asian men and one very insecure Italian restaurateur who acted like he was the actor’s keeper. Cosmo continuously poured drinks for his new celebrity friend, even forcing Swayze to call his mother up in Jersey and tell her that her son was really a good guy. Since it was on the wrong side of 4 am, I don’t think mama Cosmo appreciated the gesture. The rest of the night is sort of blurry to me. As I sat in a corner table with my lady friend, Cosmo assaulted the Italian guy, imploring him to “go home.” Then, he took some curtains down and wore them as a cape. Mr. Chiapas, who was still wet behind the ears at the time, over-appreciated Mr. Swayze with several bear hugs and even put his scarf around the actor’s neck and pulled it back and forth, kinda like a burlesque dancer would do…. Now, I do not encourage swooning over celebrities, especially ones that were part of the epic drama “Roadhouse.” However, if you ever have the chance to sit back and relax while your friends chase down and manhandle a famous actor, I strongly suggest you appreciate the situation. Unfortunately, Mr. Swayze may not be long for this world, so I would like to thank him now for a very funny night. I love birds. I don’t know why exactly. Maybe because when I was growing up the faraway places I saw on National Geographic were too out of reach, so I settled for more suburban game. When you’re a kid interested in lions, tigers and monkey-eating eagles, it’s not easy to do field research. Luckily, I grew up with a big back yard, with lots bugs and birds. Not the same as the ones shown on TV, but good enough. I spent a lot of time out there learning the names of those bugs &amp; birds and even began to understand what eats what and all the other laws of nature afforded to a kid during summertime. The bird thing has never gone away. Just like baked ziti, pin-striped uniforms and green-eyed girls, I’ve never lost my affinity for flying creatures. Whenever I need to reclaim clarity, I take a brief birding tour and put things back into perspective. It doesn’t hurt that most birds are out of human range. When babbling brooks and warbling warblers replace cell phones and honking horns, it’s easier to reach a Zen like state. Bird watching is somewhat about lists. Birders will go out of their way to seek out rare species or seasonal birds that only appear once a year during migration. I too am guilty of this practice. Last week, a Eurasian subspecies of teal was spotted in the Meadowlands and I wandered toward the sighting with the hopes of checking it off on my life list. The Eurasian Teal differs only slightly from our own Green-winged teal, but since it is a variation of the “regular” native teal, crazed birders need to go see it and check it off their lists. However, I know that the list thing is superficial and it was another bird that helped me realize this. After checking the Eurasian teal off my list,” (btw, a teal is a type of duck) I turned up the path and flushed a pair of decent sized long-eared owls. Now, there are a few things you should experience before the worms eat you. One of those things is to stand face to face with a wild owl. After withstanding the bright yellow-eyed glare of this creature, I fully understand why owls are patrons of Halloween and also the symbol for wisdom. If you move, an owl will follow you with its gaze and if you blink, it is so quiet you won’t even know it flew away. I literally froze in my tracks. Needless to say, the owl won the stare down and I went home to ponder my thoughts, not really worried about much. Let us recap. According to the previous three-part epic, atmosphere dictates mood and as a result, any scary environment can create monsters. Moreover, ( if you re member a similar HSC post from October) , there is a difference between real fear and the nonsense type of panic that the television feeds us everyday. Therefore, if certain places are haunted, (that is…if the actual essence of certain air is uniquely and unremittingly putrid, something disgusting will eventually show up) and within these authentically scary places lurk true monsters, those who acknowledge this formula should surely experience the core spirit of the holiday. But even if this is true, is it wise to do so? During Halloween, we explore spooky scenes and give candy to dirty little children who show up to our door begging all in the merriment of the unknown, which in its different forms can scare anyone. Not the type of “scared” that puts butterflies in your stomach before the start of new job or the trepidation that chills the bones upon the realization that a child-molester like Curt Schilling will win another World Series. This type of fear is more ancient. Perhaps it is a primeval peculiarity we claim to want relief from, but in reality just want a chance to tap into its source of ogreish orgasm. We have all felt it but only a few of us have the penchant ability to turnkey it into something tangible. I am curious about those who can truly translate Halloween. A few weeks back, Polish Girl and I paid homage to the home and grave of Washington Irving, America’s first celebrity writer and creator of such characters like the Headless Horseman and Rip Van Winkle. Originally from Manhattan, Irving spent some of his childhood in the Tarrytown/Sleepy Hallow sections of Westchester County and the atmosphere of the place stuck with him for the rest of his life. In fact, when Irving wrote the Legend of Sleepy Hollow he was actually living in Spain but the reminder of his days in New York resonated so soundly within his memory, he was able to cite specific locations and characters with little difficulty. When visiting his home today (now an historic landmark known as Sunnyside) it is impossible not to get a taste of this specter. It doesn’t hurt that pumpkins and headless horsemen adorn the entire town, a smart form of marketing by local residents trying to cash in on their most famous son. Of course, the people of Tarrytown did not invent the ghosts Irving wrote about, since the original Dutch settlers only recognized what the Indians they encountered knew for centuries; something is not quite right about that area near Sleepy Hollow. Maybe it took a different mind (like Irving’s) to dissect what others realized but never had the ability to highlight. On the other hand, maybe those before Irving were just too frightened to do so. Interestingly, the frequency of ghosts is not something solely attributable to Sleepy Hollow or even New Orleans , a place I recently visited that seems securely penetrated by the allure of goblins. The truth is that we are all surrounded by the unfamiliar and nameless, but either we are unable or just reluctant to obverse it. For example, my loyal readers like F. White, the Chiapas crew, Nik Social, Frank A. and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Moe Green all live in a very very haunted town. Evil has been enveloping its residents for decades. In 1870, their home, then known as Union Township was home to a sweet German woman until a bout of hallucinations caused her to attempt suicide and eventually land her in the Insane Asylum. Nearly 50 years later, this quiet little town located in the Meadowlands again made headlines when it’s Health Inspector gunned down a former mayor. Later, the Health Inspector slit his wrists and died in the bathroom of his home on Willow Ave. I wonder if his ghost still haunts that street... The crazies from this town seem to have ventured northward, even infiltrating the territory of Sister Lucy and her family. According to reports from 1924, a man named Solaski swallowed a chain of gold then went insane after the necessary stomach surgery. After the operation, he escaped from Hackensack Hospital and then beat down a bunch of police officers from the neighboring town. They shot him seven times but he still lived. I wonder if his energy is still running wild in that area… My other readers may feel safe at this time but they aren’t… Across the river from the aforementioned place in the meadowlands, fellow blogger Ricky may have to deal with flying ghostly body parts. In 1929, a 20-year old bootlegger watched for police while his friends made some illegal booze. Although, I’m not sure if they made any good hooch, they did succeed in blowing up their house. Authorities found the lookout guy in pieces nearly two blocks away! Meanwhile, Gus lives practically next door to the final resting place of Jennie Bosschieter, a young pretty mill girl who was drugged, assaulted then murdered by four wealthy businessmen from Paterson. I wonder if anyone or anything still visits her grave? Hmm… who did I leave out…. AO needs to watch out for the ghosts of runaway slaves and cousin Marge should not go to Rite Aid late at night because she may encounter the phantom of 17-year old Christine Hervish. Someone smashed her jaw then murdered her near that present location almost 85 years ago. -Note: when reading the newspaper articles, click on the image to enlarge the print The bedroom furnishings were simple, consisting of a bed, a dresser and a nightstand. Since the fittings were dusty and old we stopped short of unpacking our cloths and accessories, opting instead to leave everything in bags atop of the furniture. Regardless of grime, it was a far better decision to remain temporary and offer no sense of permanence to this house. Perhaps, the original owner of the yellow suitcase thought this realm as a comfort, only to remain here past comfortable. That considered I resigned myself to the opinion that our bags would remain virtually unpacked and our stay a brief testament of our wits. In the daytime, two long windows provided ample light to this room denying the most mischievous shadow even a limited existence. However, upon nightfall, every creature or passerby of the outside world cast the most ominous silhouettes upon the walls. A tree swaying gently in the late summer breeze depicted itself as a colossal hobgoblin with outstretched arms trying to reach inside the window. Visions of ghouls, hunchbacked and racing hurriedly on the street below, emanated from the outlines of teenagers escaping to the beach. Street cars, driving past with their lights ablaze caused the most fantastic carousel of illumination upon the walls. The light would first hit the far wall, stretch out against the ceiling and then finally fade upon that wretched hole in the corner where the cursed suitcase lay hidden. Jealously, I glanced at Barbara who was asleep and tranquil in all her snuggery. How could she sleep with all the surrounding madness? At this moment we risk abduction, but still she slumbers! I closed my eyes in hope for composure. Slowly, my breath became less erratic and my quickened pulse subdued. Realizing the responsibilities of the morning, I reluctantly reached over to the nightstand, fumbled through some medicines and swallowed half a hand of Acetamophin. It was breezy out on Grandma’s balcony, but not enough that I needed a jacket. Plus it was too much fun out here to worry about being cold. Peering down onto the noisy street filled with tiny European cars was great entertainment, especially since I was miles away from all my friends and action figures. I didn’t even notice the green shutters open but sure enough there was Great Aunt Chiara smiling at me, confounded that I was outside without something covering my shoulders. “It’s not nice to be out here this time of year, now blows the 'Sirocco,'" she said. “It’s a bad wind that comes over the ocean and from the Sahara, it could make you sick, and it’s dangerous, go inside. You shouldn’t be here, you shouldn’t be here.” A sharp rush of pain slammed into my head. Something crashed upon me causing such sudden discomfort that I cried out in agony, gasping for air as I sat up in bed. I reached my bandage-hand to my aching face and tried to make sense of what just happened. Someone punched me! I looked at Barbara, but she was tucked-in so securely, it would have taken her several minutes just to unwrap. She 
ouldn’t have slapped me and then returned to sleep so swiftly. Thoroughly shaken, I felt my surely-wounded scalp and sensed for blood, but I was unconvinced if it stemmed from my head or hand. Slowly the intensity of the headache receded but still my eyes fought to accommodate the mouth-gaping stare into the darkness. At this hour, barely a car drove by to offer some light into the bedroom, and even the breeze was fugitive. In fact, the sea air was not salty and fresh but instead thick and foul, filled with sand and the fetid presence of kelpies. The unmistakable sound of scratching nails on floorboard greeted me next. At times it came from my right side and then switched to across the room near the door. I scanned the landscape to no avail. There was nowhere to focus my attention. Then I heard the door of the storage room creak open. Luckily, the slow hum of a motorcycle was approaching the house. With any providence, the driver would direct his high beam squarely upon that miserable spot in the wall. First shadows appeared, then a flicker of a shine. The room lit dimly enough to provide the scene of a clawed hand dexterously closing the door of the suitcase chamber. I was astonished! How did that raccoon get back into the house, and how as I going to get it out of this room? If I woke Barbara up, she would freak out. I would have to sweat this one out alone. Again I waited, this time for the sounds behind the storage room. The creature scratched and jostled about, until stopping suddenly. It had noticed me. I was inching cautiously in its direction with the idea of trapping its exit with the night table. Unfortunately, this lively spirit realized my intention and now fixed its reddish gaze solidly upon my stance, causing me to freeze in terror. Not from fear of rabies or the scratching out of my eyes, but because of how my visitor chose to greet me. Instead of growling or hissing a warning, this beast of torment gurgled out a clear, discernible and human laugh. I am not sure how Barbara dealt with sleeping here. And alone for two nights! An antechamber provided privacy to the actual bedroom but also ensured our isolation from the rest of the house. If an entity first started in this room and worked its way downstairs, three to four shouts would be necessary before help arrived. If atrocities were first occurring elsewhere in the house, those of us in this bedroom would be the last to know. Even though further cut-off from its sister chambers, this bedroom still shared the bizarre habit of left-behind décor. When procuring a rental apartment of such age, it is an accepted that many came before you and many others will follow. Proper maintenance however, should ensure that remnants of previous visitors are far and few between. What was unsettling about this bedroom was that several personal effects remained within eyeshot of any vulnerable sleeper using the room. Particularly of interest were the objects found in a storage cubicle carved out of the low portion of the far wall. There was only half of a lock attached to half of a door so it was easy to peer inside the dark crevice. Still, there was not enough light to view the exact insides. I tugged on the handle and after much exertion the door jarred open, scraping my hand during the violent action. The hollow was full of mostly falling debris from the infrastructure but also strewn with bits of newspaper and other detritus insulation. The focal point was not this mess but rather a single yellow suitcase made slightly ajar by an overflow of clothing inside. Cautious to reach my bloodied hand into such a dusty hole, I warily rifled through the garments with a rolled up magazine. Beneath the final layer of flannel was a letter handwritten on both sides of loose-leaf sheet. The characters were finite and effeminate, telling the story of a Barbara and how foolish she felt about expressing her love for Douglas. Now, this was not my Barbara, but another more historic Barbara from perhaps forty years ago. This ancient Barbara read like a jealous girl that went around in scripted circles before finally realizing upon the fact that her “Doug,” had fallen for another woman. Olden Barbara lamented that the length of cold weather and time spent away from the shore convinced Douglas to stray away from her and toward an unlucky someone named “Jeane.” She wrote, “ Am I a fool to hope you still love me Doug? If it was because of Jeane, can I now be less of a fool, now that she is gone? I paid her a visit last Sunday before the infection took her. I am sorry that I was not able to ask her about my foolishness before she left, but do not blame yourself or God. Neither of you are to blame.” Satisfied that I received all that I could from this letter, I went to place it down back inside the suitcase. But before the paper fell into the bag the lid shut upon my already injured hand with such force that the sound of pinging metal resonated through the air. Wounded, I pulled my hand quickly away and slammed the door of this awkward closet shut. Right after, my Barbara arrived into the room finding me dirtied, on the floor and wincing with pain. “Stop poking around and get to bed, we have to wake up early tomorrow,” she said. “And open that window, it smells like a stuffy hospital in here.” more soon... I haven’t even told Barbara this part of the story but there were definitely some strange happenings at the old shore house from last weekend. Clearly, atmosphere dictates occurrence, I am now a true believer of that. The more you think of a place as haunted the more things will appear. Situated a mere block away from the beach, Uncle Vince ascertained the house to be “at least late 1800’s.” The creaking floorboards and low doorways confirmed his findings. What was strange to me was the mish-mash of artifacts left behind by either the actual owners or the last renters. Beheaded dolls, yellowed photos, letters, suitcases filled with clothes, even someone’s math homework from 1973. It was as if there was a horrible murder some thirty-odd years ago and everyone fled in terror. The address remaining shuttered until some wretched real estate agent looking for a quick turnover put it on the market. The house had three floors, mostly bedrooms intertwined with water closets and stairways. As with many all old-estates, it consisted of equal parts of either inhabited or empty quarters. The most vacant territory belonged to the basement. In its entirety, the lowest level was a massive one, encompassing the grand circumference of the house. No open space since partitions separated corridors and walkways, each cavity decorated with doors to nowhere, freestanding walls, and boxes upon boxes of decrepit utensils. I tried to link the artifacts or make sense of the architecture but I was thoroughly ineffective in deciphering the purpose of these rooms. Adding to my anxiety was the sense that the basement was tired of my presence. My eyes strained against any attempts to soak up the surroundings as my brain fought all urges to retreat. Finally, the gusts of antique vapors made progress impossible and by the time Barbara called for me to return to the top of the stairs, I was already in step toward her voice. The day passed into nightfall away from the house with a fish supper followed by fine conversations about things passed and things upcoming. The setting was a homely yet extremely comfortable eatery, complete with clanging silverware and delicious comfort food. While at the restaurant, our peculiar accommodations did not raise itself within the dinner’s vernacular. Why speak about the obvious? Especially since we all knew returning there was inevitable, and we were certain that any doubtful specters would remerge factual once lights were out. Great fanfare greeted our arrival home. A raccoon had scaled the roof tiles and made headway into the master bedroom via a balcony entrance. Chocolates had enticed the creature indoors and it would have nested there if Uncle Vince didn’t scare it away. Drunk on sweets the animal actually remained on the outside terrace floor until it slept off its intoxication. The lure of our own nightcaps downstairs drew us away from the scene and eventually the crowd sat contently watching TV while sipping an Apulian white. Curious how comforting the television can be. The flickering backlight pulsing away any apprehensions as the night ended. Unfortunately, it is improper to fall asleep on the couch so I forced myself to the lodgings of the top floor.

After almost 5 years and 1,112 posts, I've decided to put The BDR on indefinite hiatus. It's been a great ride. I've enjoyed almost every minute of it. But the joy of discovering and sharing has, over the past few months, become the tedium of finding and posting. So it's time to stop. I might resurrect The BDR if it feels right, or I might blog about something else. It's too early to tell. 2009 was a wonderful year, and I can't thank you enough for showing up: a third of a million visits from 190 countries yielded just shy of 640,000 page views. 3 of those visits came from Nuuk, Greenland. Thank you, Nuuk :-) Follow me on Twitter ( @theBDR ) for book-related (and other) stuff, and satisfy your book design jones over at The Casual Optimist , Faceout Books , and The Book Cover Archive . Those guys are the best. Again, my heartfelt thanks for 5 fun years. Talk to you soon. (I'm on vacation this week, so posting will be limited. But I thought it might be fun to re-publish a favorite post and ask again: what book do you really hate?) OK, enough of looking at book covers for a day or two. The Guardian's Stuart Evers has written a very, very funny article about "the good side of bad books." It's a hoot, and you should read it now . But then you should come back here and tell us about the one (or two) novels that made you want to set yourself on fire, punch yourself in the face, or question why you learned to read in the first place. I'll go first. After being hounded by my sci-fi-inclined friends for years, I read Robert Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land . When done, I immediately went out and bought two hamsters and a cage so that something could rip that book apart and pee on it. If there was an editor within 50 miles of that thing, I'll eat my shorts. I'll eat yours too. I'm not anti-science fiction. I don't read a whole bunch of it, but I don't have a problem with it per se . J.G. Ballard holds a special place on my bookshelves. But this book? Ugh. I wish I remembered more about why I hated it so deeply, but I do trust my memory of discomfort and loathing. OK. I'm done. Your turn. In no particular order, here are my favorite book covers of 2009. (And here are the 2008 , 2007 , 2006 , and 2005 lists.) Titles are linked to the original post, if one exists, and there's a poll. A big thank you to The Book Table , RiverRun Bookstore , and WORD for their lists. And thank you, readers, for a great '09. The Great Perhaps , design by Jamie Keenan: The Double Life is Twice as Good , design by Rex Bonomelli: Cheers! A History of Beer in Canada , design by David Gee: Tiepolo Pink , design by Peter Mendelsund: The Penguin Book of Gaslight Crime , illustration by Jaya Miceli: Perforated Heart , design by Jason Heuer ( some great photos here ): The Book of Dead Philosophers , design by John Gall: Experimental Geography , design by Kelly Blair: Valkyrie , design by Jason Booher ( better image here ): K Blows Top , design by Pete Garceau: Nineteen-Eighty Four , UK edition, design by Gray318 ( full wrap, etc. here ): Impossible Motherhood , design by Carin Goldberg: How to Be Inappropriate , design by Alvaro Villanueva: Columbine , design by Henry Sene Yee: Chronic City , UK edition, design by Miriam Rosenbloom: Which is your favorite? ( surveys ) I didn't want this to get lost in The Book Table's favorite covers of 2009 post . Jason from The Book Table wrote this; I love it. Jason, have you seen this ? "Our assignment was to pick 15 covers and comment on them if we wished. We think the covers speak for themselves, so instead of talking about them, we want to mention what we think was the most amazing piece of book design of the year. As much as we'd like to choose Chip Kidd's design of The Original of Laura , which we loved, or any of the designs done by Chris Ware, Oak Park's very own genius, we think the design of The Hemingses of Monticello is the best design of the year. We know that most books that we sell in the store are sold because of their spine and we know that of the thousands of books in our home, only a few at anytime have their covers displayed. Because of this, we spend a lot of time thinking about spines. The Hemingses of Monticello is the first book that we ever remember seeing that has award medals on the spine. It's a brilliant idea and makes it irresistible to everyone that goes near it." The third and final list of favorite covers from independent booksellers, in this case, hometown favorite The Book Table in Oak Park, Illinois. They've chosen some wonderful covers from small, university and foreign publishers, so help me out with the credits if you can. In most cases, the titles are linked to The Book Table's online store, in case you're in a shopping mood. Again, as in past weeks, there's a poll at the bottom. Vote for your favorite.

( polls ) Here's the second of this year's Favorite Covers of 2009 posts, chosen by some of the staff members of RiverRun Bookstore in Portsmouth, NH . Some contributors chose to let the covers speak for themselves, others provided some words about their choices. The first post is here . And like last week, there's a poll. RiverRun's favorites are: Time , design by Henry Sene Yee: Let the Great World Spin ; design by Robbin Schiff & Anna Bauer, drawing by Matteo Pericoli ( full wrap over here ): "The delicately drawn city cuts a slice in the cover, much like the beautiful slivers of lives inside the book." The Death of Bunny Munro , design by Charlotte Strick: "An evil bratty bunny! In no way does this indicate that it will garner a "Bad Sex in a Book" nomination." Animals and Objects In and Out of Water , illustration by Jay Ryan: "Are they animals? Or are they stuffed animals come to life? Are they sweet, or evil, or both??"

Heuer: "Simple, elegant, and the plum is actually referred to in the story." Alphabeasties , design credit to come: Which cover selected by RiverRun Bookstore do you like best? ( polling ) As announced a few weeks ago, I've asked three independent bookstores to contribute to this year's Favorite Covers of 2009 coverage. Here are the selections from the staff of WORD in Brooklyn, NY . Three more lists (including my selections) are on the way. The only guideline I asked the good folks at WORD to follow was to limit their selections to books published this year, so I was glad to see them include some YA and children's books -- I don't get around to discussing either genre very often. I couldn't chase down all the design credits, so if you know something I don't, please set me on the right track so that I can give proper credit for this fantastic work. And of course correct me if I've gotten something wrong. There's a poll at the bottom of the post: vote for your favorite. The top three vote-getting designs from this list will eventually join the other favorites from the upcoming lists in a final poll. Lastly: each title is linked to WORD's online store. Something tickling your fancy? Support indie bookstores and buy from them. WORD's favorite covers of the year, in no particular order, are: Wuthering Heights , design by Ruben Toledo: "This is our favorite of the three covers Toledo did for Penguin Classics Deluxe Editions." The Sickness Unto Death , design by David Pearson: "This is really a shout-out to the entire line-up of the newest installment of the Penguin Great Ideas series, though this is probably our favorite cover of the bunch. These are some of the most irresistible book covers I have ever seen. They're all embossed. Almost everyone who looks at them touches them and then moans ecstatically." There Once Lived a Woman Who Tried to Kill Her Neighbor's Baby , design by Christopher Brand: "This made our top 10 last month, probably solely on the strength of the cover." The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov , design by Barbara de Wilde: "We love the new Nabokov covers , and this is our favorite of the bunch." Seven Nights , design by Rodrigo Corral: "Love this so much that I continually re-display it just to look at it." Pure , design by Cara Petrus: "a teen novel about purity rings and the girls who wear them (and a girl who breaks her pledge). " The Book of Fathers : design by John Gall, collage by Nicole Natri: "The men and the arms on the cover are raised. It's possible we just like this because it looks like the art of a former employee. Didn't love it at first, but it has really grown on us since it came in, to the point that now we love it." Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image ; design by Mark Abrams, cover image by Jim Fitzpatrick, original photo by Alberto Korda: "There could be no better cover for a book about history's most reproduced image." The Children's Book , design by Stephen Parker, "adapted by Gabrielle Wilson" (per the jacket): "A beautiful cover that only gets more beautiful after you've read the book." (I snapped this to show some of the detail; there's a much better photo here ): The City Out My Window : "The only die-cut we will ever like in this store (we hate die cuts because they inevitably rip on the floor, no matter what you do with them, and then nobody wants to buy them). But this one is thick cardboard, and obviously a perfect choice of a book of window pictures." The End of Food , design by Mark Robinson: "Love when the paperback is way better than the hardcover ." The Lion and the Mouse , designer by Saho Fuji: "Not sure if this one counts, but we love it." The Most Beautiful Book in the World , design by Emanuele Ragnisco: "Even though it feels kind of busy on this cover, the image is just so great." Never Smile At A Monkey: And 17 Other Important Things to Remember , design by Scott Magoon, illustration by Steve Jenkins: "Even though it kinda scares me." Which cover selected by WORD do you like best? ( survey ) Design by Lisa Marie Pompilio Photograph by Ken Rosenthal The first of this year's favorite covers posts will appear tonight (I have to chase down a few design credits). In the meantime, feast on this, before it feasts on you.
Waiter Rant has moved!!!!! Update your bookmarks and your feed links - welcome to the new Waiter Rant , now at www.waiterrant.net New posts will no longer appear at this address, please update your bookmarks, links and feeds!!!!!! Please change your bookmarks and feeds to www.waiterrant.net ! For technical reasons beyond our control....... Commenting will be disabled for the next two days. I'll resume posting Tuesday. I have a surprise in store for you. Where's Prozac When You Need It? The phone rings. "The Bistro," I answer, "How can I help you?" "What kind of cuisine do you serve?" a female voice asks. "Northern Italian madam." "And what's your sushi special tonight?" I pause a moment. "We don't serve sushi madam." "Why not?" "Because we're not a Japanese restaurant?" The caller thinks about that for a sec. "Do you serve tuna?" she asks. "We do." "Can't you make sushi out of that?" "No." "Why not?" she asks incredulously. "Because." "Oh." There's a long pause. I can visualize this woman sucking her thumb. "Would you like to make a reservation?" I ask "No, I really wanted sushi tonight." "Sorry," I verbally shrug. "Could you suggest a place?" she asks testily. I give her the name and number of a very expensive sushi house and hang up. I look at the clock and sigh. So far I've put in eighty hours at the Bistro. When Fluvio comes back this Sunday it'll be 110 hours without a break. Phone calls like this threaten to destroy whatever sanity I have left. It's time to self medicate. I go to the back and fetch a can of my new best friend – Red Bull. "Cocaine in a can?" Gerald quips as he walks by. "I can't afford the real thing," I deadpan. "The dumpster dealers will cut you a break," Gerald says, referring to the criminal element that delivers behind restaurants everywhere. "Never did that stuff actually," I reply. "A couple more of these double shifts and you will be," Gerald observes. "I'd settle for some Prozac," I say, "Got any?" "I'm fresh out." "Damn." I go back to the front and start reading The Times. The Red Bull kicks in. Great. Now I'm wide awake borderline psychotic. I try and lose myself in the Dining In Section. There's a good article about aperitifs. I crack up when I get to the part about Cynar, a liquor made from artichokes. Sounds disgusting I know but it's quite good on the rocks with soda. We have it. No one orders it. Hmmm. I wonder how that would taste mixed with Red Bull…………. Gerald interrupts my reverie. "The lady on 26 left her credit card on the table," he says handing me the checkbook. I look at the folder. Not only did she forget her card – she forgot to sign the receipt and leave a tip. "Was this woman drunk?" I ask. "I wish she was," Gerald replies, "she and might have been less of a bitch." "What was the problem?" "You know the type," Gerald says drolly, ''water with lemon, chicken Caesar spilt, and three hours of prattling with her friend." "You can retire on checks like that," I observe humorlessly. "You'll take care of it?" Gerald asks. "I'll lock up the card," I reply, "maybe she'll come back for it." "Ok." Two hours go by. The lady doesn't come back. I call the credit card company. "Hello, Credit Card Company," a pleasant voice chirps, "How can I help you?" "A patron left her card behind in my restaurant," I say, "Could you call her and let her know we have it?" "What's the number on the card?" the rep asks. I rattle of some digits. "Thank you sir," the rep says, "that card has now been deactivated." "Wait a minute," I yelp, "I just wanted you to call the woman and tell her we have her card!" "I'm sorry but its procedure to invalidate a card when it's reported lost or stolen." "Could you at least call the lady and tell her she left her card here?" I ask. "I'm not allowed to relay messages to a card member," the rep drones robotically. "But…." "Please destroy the card." "But…." "Destroying the card protects you and the customer," the rep continues. "But…." "Thank you for calling the Credit Card Company. Have a nice day." Click. Gerald comes back up to the hostess stand. "Were you able to get a hold of her?" he asks. "I called the credit card company and they canceled the card." "Why didn't you call information and try and get her number?" Now why didn't I think of that? Maybe because I'm exhausted. "Too late now," I say. "Try anyway." I call information. The name on the card is unique. Of course they have her number. I ring her up. "Hello," a professional voice answers. "This is %-&amp;%- at The Bistro. You left your credit card here." "Oh yes I know." "I'm sorry but I tried to have the credit card company contact you and they invalidated the card." "WHAT!!!!!!" the woman shrieks, "I just got that card!" "I'm sorry. I should've tried to call information and find you. But my first impulse was to call the credit card company." "THAT WAS THE WRONG IMPULSE!" the woman yells. "Well it's been deactivated for your protection." "You're really stupid," the woman huffs. "Well madam," I reply angrily, "you left your card here, didn’t sign the bill, and forgot to leave the waiter a tip. I don't know you. What would you have me do?" "Now I have to get a brand new card!" the woman moans ignoring my tirade. I look at the name embossed on the card. It has the letters Ph.D on the end. "Pardon me," I ask, "are you a psychologist?" "I'm a therapist," she says, "Why?" "Just satisfying my curiosity," I murmur. The woman hangs up violently. I hope she wasn't with a patient. Then again I feel bad for anyone she's treating. I cut up the card into tiny pieces and dispose of it. Gerald returns. "So what happened?" I tell him. "So I don't get a tip?" he asks. "Something tells me you weren't getting one anyway," I reply. Gerald laughs. "Fuck her." I echo the sentiment and return to my paper. I look at the clock. Monday will be my first day off after eleven double shifts. I can't wait. Phone calls like this don't help. I'm burnt out. I start praying for a blackout so I can close early. Of course it doesn't happen. I'm not gonna make it three more days. I better get some Prozac soon. They should start putting it in Red Bull. Hmmmm. Now there's a million dollar idea. Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net ! Attention Loyal Waiter Rant Readers! Waiter Rant is going to be down for maintenance for a short time today. The changes I hinted at earlier are coming soon. I have worked 70 hours so far this week without a day off. After I get some rest (and time to write) I'll post more new stories. Baby Bucks I'm tired. Fluvio went on vacation and I'm stuck minding the store. I've got seven more double shifts till he comes back. I'm worried. It's only Sunday and I'm already punchy. There are bags under my eyes and my cheeks ache from maintaining the customer friendly smile. My feet hurt. Every customer is becoming an obstacle to overcome. I dread the phone. Waiters constantly harass me with problems. By the end of the week I'll probably be psychotic. The Sunday rush ends. The last tables are finishing their espressos. Soon the Bistro will be empty. I look at the clock. Fifteen minutes till closing. Thank God. I want to be in bed before midnight. I start doing my cashout. I'm wondering why the drawer is short ten bucks when the door chimes. A youngish guy stands in the doorway. Damn. "Can I help you sir?" I say cheerily, but my heart isn't in it. "Can I get a drink and some take out?" the man asks. The guy looks familiar. I spin through my mental rolodex of faces. Ah, there he is. Dan something or other. Cute wife. He proposed to her in my section two years ago. I stuck the ring on a piece of tiramisu. Now they're expecting their first child. Tempus Fugit. "How's your lovely wife sir?" I ask, smiling at the memory of his spouse, laden with child, sweating like a pig in the July heat. "She had the baby earlier this evening," he replies with a wan smile. "Congratulations!" I offer. "Thanks." I can’t help but notice this guy doesn't look entirely happy. "Mother and baby are both well?" I ask carefully. "Yeah they're both ok. Jen was in labor for twenty four hours." "Yikes" "Now she wants Porcini Risotto from her favorite place," he says. I groan inwardly and pull out my dupe pad. I have to let this guy get some food or my soul will burn in hell. The kitchen guys are gonna be pissed. "So one Porcini Risotto. Anything for you sir?" "Just a Ketel One on the rocks." "Coming right up." I put the risotto order in over protest and get the guy his drink. "Here you go," I say handing the man a frosted highball glass. He scarfs the vodka down greedily. "Want another?" I chuckle. If I just had a kid I'd drink too. After a short pause New Dad replies, "No I'm good." "Well it'll be twenty minutes until your entrée's ready. If you want another let me know," I offer as I return to the cash drawer to find my missing ten bucks. I start counting but stop. Something's not right. Even with my back turned I can feel the tension coming off this guy in waves. I'm emotionally attenuated I guess. Chalk it up to my years working in a psychiatric hospital. I turn around. New Dad's knee is bopping up and down nervously. His discomfort is making me anxious. I decide to intervene. "So did you have a boy or a girl?" I ask. "A girl." "You poor man," I say winking. "Tell me about it," the man sighs. "God has an exquisite sense of justice sometimes doesn't he?" That provokes a laugh. "You're right," the guy agrees. Now you might think my comment's inappropriate but it isn't. Whenever men undergo a major life event, like getting married or having a baby, we guys tend to respond with a certain gallows humor. For example, my brother, on his wedding day, had to walk down a long dimly lit corridor to reach the main part of the church. As we groomsmen walked behind him, ostensibly to keep him from running away, I was reminded of a line from a movie. I couldn't help myself. "Dead man walking!" I cried out. The guys cracked up. The minister cracked up. My brother smiled nervously and walked to the altar to await his bride. Now he's married and sipping beer on some beach in Maui with his beautiful wife. My point? Sometimes a little ribbing helps soothe a guy's anxiety and snaps everything into proper perspective. Usually. "And then there's dating. Oh man…." I continue saying to New Dad. The guy's laugh's smaller this time. Actually he looks like he's about to throw up. Ok, so maybe gallows humor isn't the way to go. A quiet minute passes. The guy stares at the floor. He take a deep breath like he's about to say something. He doesn't. The clock ticks. I see moisture in his eyes. "You'll be fine," I say gently. The guy wipes his face quickly. "Yeah I know," he says, "but there's so much to worry about. I mean summer camp, private school, college. You know what college is gonna cost in eighteen years?" "No idea." "A million bucks!" he explodes. "That much?" I wonder skeptically. "And then there's braces, toys, broken arms," New Dad gushes as if a dam burst from within I recognize what's happening. When New Dad held his baby for the first time the enormity of what's happening hit him. He's trying to process it all at once. I don't have kids of my own but I have friends who do. I've seen how they've handled it. I know what to say. I hope someone says it to me when my time comes. "It's a lot of stuff but you'll break it down into small steps and it'll come together," I offer quietly. "I guess," New Dad says. "Think about everything at once and you'll go nuts," I say, "just remember, one day at a time." "Your right," New Dad exhales. "Enjoy your little girl. She's only a baby once." I finally see a real smile. "She's beautiful," he says. "I'll bet she is." "You have kids?" New Dad asks. "Me? Hell no. I just have joint custody of a dog." "You'd be a good father." I feel myself blushing. "Thank you sir." "How old are you?" "Thirty seven," I reply. New Dad is about ten years my junior. "Well, be sure you have them before it's too late…" "Sir," I say clasping my hand on New Dad's shoulder, "one of the great things about being a guy is we can still make babies twenty minutes after we're dead." New Dad emits a soul cleansing laugh. "I have plenty of time," I reassure him. "You're a funny guy," New Dad says. "I try sir." The food's ready. I slip a tiramisu, gratis, into the bag, run the check, and take the order to New Dad. "All set sir," I say, "and since your wife likes tiramisu so much I threw one in on the house." "Thank you," New Dad says shaking my hand. "You're very welcome." The guy signs the check and leaves. I watch him walk off into the night his life changed forever. That kid's gonna be all right. When I open the checkbook and my exhaustion dissipates. On a thirty dollar check the guy tipped me fifty bucks. Totally unexpected. As I close up the Bistro I can't wipe the grin off my face. Baby bucks! Ka-Ching. I hope this guy has lots of babies. Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net ! Please update your bookmarks and links to www.waiterrant.net To the Rescue! I've received a couple of aggrieved emails lamenting that I haven't written many posts this week. I'm grateful to have readers that eagerly await each post. The readers, as you can see by the comments, are one of the major reasons why Waiter Rant's traffic has steadily risen over the past months. Thank you! Normally I post two to three times per week. This past week has been especially crazy for me. My brother got married over the weekend. Now, "Fluvio," my boss, is going on vacation and I'm going to be living at the Bistro for the next twelve days. That's right – I'm gonna have to drag my laptop to work! Right now, this instant, I'm sitting to write a post when Fluvio calls. "Hello?" "Get over here. Gwen is throwing up all over the place." Oh, that's appetizing. I groan and look at the clock. It's too early to be hearing this shit. "So what do you want me to do?" I ask. "The restaurant is full and I have no one to work," Fluvio says. I can hear the near panic rising in his voice. "Can Gwen hold on till I get there?" I ask. "I don't think so." I sigh deeply. I wanted to post today. But I've got a job to do. I've got to go now. "I'm on my way boss," I say. Off to the rescue. Again. "Thanks!" Fluvio says hanging up. Folks - I've got to go! I'm a waiter after all! Have a nice weekend. New stories next week! Attention! Waiter Rant has moved to www.waiterrant.net . Please change your links and bookmarks to www.waiterrant.net . Thanks! Lawyer Blog "It is the trade of lawyers to question everything, yield nothing, and to talk by the hour." - Thomas Jefferson Over the past couple of weeks I've been reading Opinionistas , a blog written by a young female lawyer in NYC. In addition to her describing life as an indentured billable hour servant, replete with grueling hours and impossible workloads, she also describes colleagues sloughing off their youthful idealism as they struggle inside the pressure cooker environment of a major law firm. I particularly liked this entry - Casting That Stone . It’s about how some women seem to abandon their hard earned professional lives in pursuit of safe, boring, marriageable men. Opinionista wonders if women have evolved, if at all, during the past sixty years of feminist awareness. But what I really like about this blog is that you get the sense the author is in the midst of a psychological struggle of her own. In her world of high priced graduate schools, expensed lunches, and status hungry sycophants; everyone is constantly comparing themselves to everybody else. Do I make enough money? Am I more successful? Why is she married and not me? Who's got a corner office? Why did that associate get the deal? It can be a toxic soul eroding landscape that not everyone survives with decency intact. Its obvious Opinionista has second thoughts about being a lawyer. Her ambivalence permeates the entire blog and you wonder what she'll end up doing. Will she chuck her expensive law school degree? Or will she make whatever accommodations she needs to make within herself to remain a lawyer? It's a process all professionals struggle with when they realize the career they've dreamed about since high school isn't all it's cracked up to be. Well written and humorous - I recommend you check Opinionista out. The author
does "question everything" but yields insights into a slice of life we might otherwise have never known about. Go read! My Name is Clark Kent Now that I'm thirty-seven I need glasses in order to read. Not prescription eyewear, just a good set of readers you can pick up at any pharmacy. Years of reading books, peering into computer monitors, and working in low lighting have taken their toll. At least the glasses lend me a professorial air. I'm constantly taking the glasses on and off. I'm always reading something – a dupe pad, the POS monitor, or an order form. Sometimes I'm wearing them tableside. Sometimes I'm not. This occasionally leads to confusion…. A four top sits in my section. I'm wearing my glasses. I go to the table, special, cocktail them, and take their order. When I deliver the apps I've taken the glasses off. "Excuse me," a rather distinguished looking man says, "Could you ask our waiter to come over here?" Huh? I am the waiter. "I beg your pardon sir?" I ask. "Could you get the waiter with the glasses?" I stifle a laugh. Without my spectacles this guy thinks I'm a completely different person. "Right away sir," I reply. I duck out of sight and put my glasses back on. I return to the table. "How can I help you sir?" "I’d like another Manhattan please," the man asks. I make a little bow and go to make the man's drink. I take my glasses off and deliver the cocktail to him. "Who wanted the Manhattan?" I call out. "It’s for me," the man signals. As I place the drink in front of him he peers at me intently. "Hey, you’re the same guy!" the man yelps. "Actually my evil twin works here too. I guess you've met him," I reply winking. The table busts out laughing. "Arthur it's always been the same guy. You’re the one who needs glasses," his wife teases. Chagrined the man take a sip of his drink. "Your other brother is the handsome one," he says. Touche my brother. Touché. I put my glasses back on. The table's cracking up. "So I look better with the glasses on?" I ask. "Actually nothing can improve your mug," the man ripostes. I like this guy. He's customer you can screw with. An optometrist eats in our bistro almost every day. He's left us a pile of business cards. I leave the table and go and fetch one. Returning I hand the card to Arthur the Blind. "Call this guy. He can help you pick out a nice pair," I say triumphantly. "Ok, ok," the man says waving his hands in surrender. "If I may say sir, you desperately need them," I continue. The table is in stitches. "I like your other brother better," Arthur laughs. "Make sure you leave him a nice tip," I counter. Arthur's wife turns to me and says, "You are the first waiter to ever give it back to him. Good for you." Lady, I'm letting him off easy. "For everything there is a first time," I say. The table finishes dinner. I hand the check to Arthur sans spectacles. "Here you go sir. Please don't be mad at my brother. He's a bad, bad waiter." The man chuckles and takes the checkbook. When I return the book is stuffed with cash. "That's all for you," Arthur says smiling. "Thank you sir," I move out of sight and count out the bills. On a $200 check I get fifty bucks. Righteous. The table gets up to leave. I thank the man for his generosity. "You're a good sport sir," I say. You really threw me with the glasses." "Well sir," I say opening the door for him, "now I know how Clark Kent got away with it for so long." The man roars with laughter and walks out into the humid night. As I watch him go I realize Clark Kent and I have a lot in common. Like the reporter from the Daily Planet I too have a secret identity to protect. Mild mannered waiter by day – Superblogger by night! Hey, I've always wanted to be a superhero. I think I'll indulge myself in that delusion for a while. Just call me Clark Kent. Now where's a phone booth?
I've spent the last few days sick, ugh. Hoping today is better. I think I'll read comics for a bit and then tackle work. More sketches to accompany a short story I wrote. An amazing band covering an amazing song originally done by New Order. Theodor Kittelsen is an artist, like John Bauer that deserves wider recognition in the English speaking world. Kittleson, also like Bauer, is primarily known as a "troll" artist as his best known work was illustrations for books on Norwegian folklore. Unlike Bauer, whose work is filled with unthreatening and friendly trolls Kittelsen monsters are darker, more mysterious and much more frightening. These works are amazing and haunting and have had a huge impact on me. A sketch I did of Atha. Not a lot to say this morning. We're feeding Henry and it's really windy and wet out. I'm off to play RPGs this afternoon. Plan to check out comic shop called The Hairy Tarantula. That's it. A pretty amazing sword &amp; sorcery romp. I can't believe I've never read it before. Moore's writing is quite good, not overwrought like some pulp stuff. The book also feels pretty fresh and original. Not a lot female characters in the sub-genre have been quite like this.I was disappointed she only wrote this handful of Jirel stories. Some sketches for an upcoming book cover I'm working on. The above picture I did to as a sample for a job. It was rejected by the author because he thought the coyote wasn't sly enough. This was one of Canada's most famous writers. Ouch! I got over it. I don't really like his books anyway. I got such great responses to my post on rejection a few days ago I thought I'd post some quotes from them here. Russel Dickerson said ".... there's no one on Earth harder on my work than I am. The actual rejections I've received haven't said anything worse than I've already thought." Glendon Mellow "... send them more artwork. A change in editorial personnel or style, or even just the right art at the right time may see the relationship change for the positive. Rod McKie "Bide your time Eric, the best revenge is living well." Charlene "I don't think they mean 'you suck', which is probably where the sting comes from for most of us." Dave Howlett "Best you can do is believe in yourself and that what you are doing is both worthwhile and something that you would enjoy reading yourself. Certainly no editor should be able to discourage that, whatever their reasoning." Grimalkin Press "PROVE THEM WRONG." Madeline Carol Matz "rejection letters is like an actor not getting a callback for a part. " Viviane Schwartz "Ah, you can't please them all... If the illustrations they generally use look really different from yours than that's just what they're set on using. - It's really frustrating."
Same old, same new. A senior Iraqi spy has accused the prime minister, Nour al-Maliki, of handing out thousands of guns to tribal leaders in a bid to win votes. The claim was made by Iraqi National Intelligence Service former spokesman, Saad al-Alusi, a week before Iraq's general election, in which allegations of vote buying and exorbitant handouts have become widespread. Maliki, who faces a bitterly contested final week of campaigning ahead of the7 March poll, has been photographed handing out guns to supporters in southern Iraq, engraved with a personal message from his office. However he denies that the delivery of weapons, along with cash payments, were improper. Alusi, who was the INIS spokesman until he was asked to move to another ministry eight days ago, said some 8,000 guns were ordered from a Serbian supplier at the end of 2008 for use by intelligence officers. However he claimed Maliki "denied our contract at the last minute and made his own contract of 10,000 pistols, which he has used as election propaganda for himself and his party.

The small bank is located just across the river from the Green Zone and a few hundred yards away from the residences of Hakim, Adil Abdul Mahdi and Badr Brigade (now members of the Presidential Brigade) checkpoints. They were tied up and killed execution-style by a group of officers who were members of Vice President Adil Abdul Mahdi's security detail on their own turf in Jadiriya. The incident was carried out on July 28 after midnight. A huge portion of the stolen money ($4.5 million) was then located at the offices of al-'Adala (justice) newspaper (which, as you guessed, is owned by Abdul Mahdi). In fact it turns out that the two officers who were in charge of the heist were not arrested but have already fled Iraq (who helped them flee?). PM Maliki has stepped in to cover up for his partners in crime once more, and all public debate of the incident has been stifled. Iraqis seem to have been shocked by the brutal crime and its implications but nothing more than that. The outrage of a few brave journalists ended just two days after the incident, and now everyone is warning against rushing to conclusions or using the incident as an excuse to defame our politicians and "Islamic symbols" (whatever that means). I don't think the symbolism of the crime was missed by Iraqis: I rule over you and plunder your wealth while you live like animals, and I will tie you up, blindfold you and shoot you in the head at will, because I can get away with it. Rule of law mal teezi , as we say in Iraq. However, we, the Iraqis, will bend over, once more, and take it up the behind from our rulers, as we have always done throughout our history. That's all. - Sorry for the unannounced absence. Will start posting again regularly once I'm finished with my dental board exams.

The word “permanent” appears on many different art products, but it’s a confusing term. On many graphic art products, such as inks or felt-tipped markers, it really means “waterproof,” rather than “lightfast.” Many calligraphy or fountain pen inks, such as the brown inks in the drawing above, are not waterproof, but they’re reasonably lightfast, considering that most handwriting isn’t usually subjected to light for long periods. The sketches are for sky galleys, part of the planning for Waterfall City , from Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time . Here's what the Calvin Theater looked like in 1995. The sketch is in pencil and marker. First, let's have a look at a video. What you’ll see is a visualization of three different color schemes as 3D shapes floating within the RGB color space. (If this embedded video doesn't play, try this link to YouTube ). Each painting will be followed by an irregular shape that represents the range of colors used within that composition. If you’ve read this blog for a while or dug back in the archives, you may remember seeing how we can chart a color scheme as a shape or gamut that takes up part of a color wheel. Everything outside the gamut is left out of the composition. The painting Palace in the Clouds, above, has a gamut limited to intense blue, opposed by fairly dull reds and yellows, and some fairly dull dark greens. To the right of that is a computer-generated image made by sampling all the pixels and charting them on a color wheel. The software was created by Phillipe Colantoni, and is available for Windows users at couleur.org. We can also combine the value or lightness data to see the color scheme as a 3D representation inside an RGB cube. The RGB color space is created by graphing red, green, and blue as three separate vectors in XYZ space. (The green vector above is hidden by the gamut.) Where the vectors intersect is pure black. At the opposite corner is pure white. In this configuration, the secondaries are cyan, magenta, and yellow, which would lie on the plane between each of the two vectors. A pure yellow, for example, would be on the plane formed by red and green (the horizontal plane in this view). By comparing each of the paintings with its gamut in RGB color space, and then comparing the gamuts to each other, you can see how the gamuts vary. The gamut for Crocodile Swamp is narrower because the color scheme is more limited. There are hardly any blues. The yellow windows in this scene show up as a scattering of yellow dots at the bottom of the gamut. ------ Software by P. Colantoni at couleur.org. Animation by Lester Yocum at lesteryocum.com Previously on GurneyJourney: Color Wheel Masking Update We take for granted that our experience of vision results from the interaction of light with objects. It’s obvious, isn’t it? Light shines on objects, bounces off them, and then it stimulates our eyes. But for thousands of years, that basic concept was not understood. People only knew was that there was some sort of connection between the eyes and the objects seen. During the time of Aristotle in the fourth century BC, one school of thought held that the eyes emitted a visual fire that traveled to the object and somehow massaged it. Others believed that objects gave off a substance that flew toward the eye. These notions persisted until the time of Leonardo, who objected to the idea of fire from the eyes. He said there wouldn’t be time, after opening the eyes, for the fire to leave the eyes and travel all the way to a distant object and return. Others reasoned that if the objects gave off a flaming substance, why can’t we see at night? The breakthrough came from an Arab physicist Alhazen around 1000 AD, who noticed that light traveled into the eye and caused it pain. He also noticed that we experience afterimages after looking at bright light. Light—not just our eyes, and not the objects themselves—was the agent of vision. What I wonder as I reflect on these ideas is what was the ancient conception of light? It's mentioned often in the Hebrew bible, of course. Surely the ancients were sensitive of the action of light around them. How they regard it differently if they didn't understand its role in vision? ------ Based on material from Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing, by Margaret Livingstone. Image from Discover. Here’s a rare glimpse of official art from North Korea, with explanations by B.R. Myers, a contributor to Foreign Policy magazine. “Kim Jong Il comforts a distraught nation after his father's death on July 8, 1994. In the background is the 66-foot bronze statue of the Great Leader that was erected on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang in 1972. Dark skies in depictions of this period symbolize the growing threat from without.” “The Dear Leader stands guard as the waves of a hostile world crash ineffectually against the rocks.” Say what you want about the grandiose personality cult and the bizarre geopolitical posturing. I’m intrigued by the paintings themselves. That’s some darn good water painting in the second piece, especially in the recoil of the foamy wave on the left. The strong silhouette, and Kim’s resolute defiance remind me of N.C. Wyeth’s Billy Bones. Just swap the spyglass for tinted specs. Look at the far red flag in the second painting. It sits back in space because of the muted color and the softened top edge. All the figures are well studied, though the value organization is a little busy. The grouping of figures reminds me of 19th century Russian history painters like Vasily Surikov (1848-1916). Official art in east Asia took much of its early inspiration from the Russian painters. Back in the late 70s, I used to go to Chinatown in L.A. to collect Mao posters, which were impressive paintings on a lot of levels. They’re a piece of history now. I’ve had the privilege of meeting many of the artists who painted them, and their stories are fascinating. See more examples and read political commentary: B.R. Myers on Foreign Policy , Thanks, Bryn. The great color theorist Albert Munsell observed that a given color reaches its greatest chroma at one particular value, called the home value or the peak saturation value. That peak value varies from color to color. An orange-yellow, for example, is most intense at a very light value, while blue is strongest when it is very dark. Red reaches maximum chroma at a middle value. The hand-painted chart takes the three hues through all possible degrees of chroma and value. Yellow becomes a brown when it darkens, and you just can't get a strong chroma from a dark yellow. In the chart, chroma is meant to be constant along a vertical line, while value is constant on a horizontal line. It’s good color mixing practice to make these charts, and Munsell-schooled artists benefit greatly from the experience. For these charts I have arbitrarily limited the chroma range to six steps. But in Munsell’s system, there can be many more steps, and theoretically there’s no upper limit to the measurement of chroma. New pigments keep pushing the range farther out. This digital chart from David Briggs's excellent website huevaluechroma shows a range of hues taken through the paces. Follow that link to his discussion of the same topic. Tom Lopez of ZBS Productions created a full-length audio adaptation of Dinotopia: The World Beneath using actors, sound effects, and music by Tim Clark. This excerpt takes you from the pirate’s roost at Black Fish Tavern to the entrance of the luminous caverns. It combines the audio track with a slide show, shot from the original artwork. The pictures start at 0:30. If you want to hear the whole 2 hour plus production (great for long car trips or studio stints), you can get a 2 CD set at the Dinotopia Online Store, or you can purchase a download at the ZBS website. This coming Saturday, March 13, I invite you to join me at the Norman Rockwell Museum for an afternoon art program. The event is free with admission, and will be fun for all ages. I’ll start at 1:00 with a digital slide presentation that shows what goes into making a realistic picture of an imaginary subject, including Dinotopia and other projects. Then I’ll sign books, which will be available at the museum store. But you can also bring your old copies, too—the more tattered the better. From about 2:30 to 4:00 we’ll draw dinosaurs together. I’ll do a couple of demonstration drawings, and I’ll bring a bunch of dinosaur models that we can all work from. I’ll try to answer whatever questions you have, and give pointers to artists of all ages—young people just learning to draw and experienced artists with specific questions. The Rockwell Museum is always a fun place to hang out, and right now they’ve got a new exhibit of Rockwell’s fan letters in addition to "Norman Rockwell, Behind the Camera." More information at the Museum site. Admission is free for kids and teens thanks to support from Blantyre, Country Curtains, and The Red Lion Inn.

Vaughn, Brian K., George Jeanty and Joss Whedon. Vol 2: No future for you. Milwaukie, OR: Dark Horse, 2009. Goddard, Drew, George Jeanty and Joss Whedon. Vol 3: Wolves at the Gate. Milwaukie, OR: Dark Horse, 2009. Whedon, Joss, Karl Moline and Jeph Loeb. Vol 4: Time of you life. Milwaukie, OR: Dark Horse, 2009. Now this is more like it! A little while ago, when I reviewed the first volume of the collected Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 series from Dark Horse, I was kind of disappointed. I felt the story telling was choppy and jumbled and that it lacked a lot of the real character development strengths of the original TV series. Well, the next three volumes of the series are a huge improvement. They are Volume 2, No Future For You , volume 3, Wolves at the Gate and volume 4, Time of Your Life . The main V2 arc is a Faith story, wherein Giles employs Faith to do some Council-type wetwork, stuff he wouldn't want to get Buffy involved in. It's a good, compelling read, getting two somewhat less involved characters in V1 back into the main line of Season 8. V3 Brings Dracula back, this time on Buffy's side, battling against some rogue Japanese vampires. V4 brings the futuristic Fray back into the mix, as Buffy travels into the future. V4 also brings Willow back into the main stream of the Season 8 arc. Each volume also has a shorter stand-alone story, which is basically used for some character development, which often gets a bit of short shrift in the main volume arc. Over all, I am pleased with how the S8 arc is developing -- just like more season arcs developed. Slowly during the first part of the season, setting up the big push later on. And the Twilight Big Bad arc for S8 is still pretty mysterious, so I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops. I still have a few quibbles, of course, and I think the biggest is how a lot of the character stuff if peripheral to the main story arc. In the tv series, the character development and the story arc were always very tightly bound, basically one growing out of the other. Buffy and the other characters grew and changed because of what was happening to them, and even by S6 what was happening to them became the main story arc. In the comic series so far, they've much more tended to seal off the plot from the characterization. And I think it's a mistake. We really need to get back into the hearts and minds of the characters by the end of the arc, that's what needs to drive everything else. And if it doesn't happen, it'll be hard to judge S8 as a success. Andrew Fox's first two novels, Fat White Vampire Blues and Bride of the Fat White Vampire were entertaining and over-the-top, a couple of innovative entries into the vampire cannon. Cinematic and funny, touching and absurd, they were terrific reads if not quite great literature. Now comes The Good Humor Man . It's a lot of the same things as the earlier books: obsessed with pop culture, very cinematic, funny and absurd although not quite as touching and romantic. On the other hand, it's also a lot more thought-provoking with a satirical edge that's a lot more upfront than the earlier work. What's it about? Think of it as Fahrenheit 451 for the diet industry. Imagine a future USA where high calorie foods are illegal, and a gang of government-sponsored thugs will raid any high-cal party they find. Imagine if one of the founders of the movement suddenly thinks it's all going too far and that people should really be free to make their own choices in life. Furthermore, it's also not hard to imagine that Big Food has come up with a few secrets of it's own. Our newly converted hero then needs to save the day. What results is an amazing road trip into the heart of American food culture – Fat Elvis. Yes, Fat Elvis is the driving force (but not character, remember, it's the future) and inspiration for the book. More than that, I cannot reveal. Anyways, it's all kinda indescribable anyways. Liposuction, for example, is also a strangely important driving force in the novel. Read it. It's fun and thoughtful and way OTT. In fact, every time you think Fox can't possibly go more OTT, he pulls another fried peanut butter and banana sandwich out of his hat. Seamus Cooper's The Mall of Cthulhu is a seriously strange and funny book. Okay, here goes. A decade before the main action, Ted, a regular college kid, saves his lesbian best friend, Laura, from a horde of vampires trying to initiate her into their sorority; he's traumatized by having to massacre the whole nest of vampires (including a recently turned frat friend). Ten years later, she's joined the FBI as an analyst while he's unable to overcome his past and is following her from city to city as her career progresses, all the while working a series of McJobs. Now, he stumbles on a Lovecraftian conspiracy. A bunch of white supremacists are working to bring the Great Old Ones back from their dimension. Ultimately, Ted and Laura work together along with a shadowy yet underfunded government agency to fight them back. Light-hearted yet still a bit scary, this is a fantastic first novel. Good adventure, engaging characters, some self-deprecating insights into slacker/nerd culture, more-or-less tight plotting, tons of Lovecraft and other pop culture in-jokes not to mention a whole lot of winking and nudging – this is an entertaining melange. I certainly hope Cooper will bring Ted and Laura back for more supernatural adventures. If the vampire novel is slipping down into the realm of the bodice ripper, it seems to me that zombies are the new vampire – able to actually embody horror without romance or any kind of soft and fuzzy feelings. Zombies mostly evoke fear and terror and a almost fatalistic wonder at the randomness of the universe. In the hands of a great up-and-coming horror novelist, zombies can be gold. Jonathan Maberry is just such a writer, the award-winning author of the Ghost Road Blues series of horror novels . Patient Zero is another real winner from Maberry, if anything even better than his earlier trilogy. It's a combination zombie horror and medical thriller – a very good example of the kind of hybrid science fiction horror genre that's bound to become more and more popular. Basically, the idea is that a Baltimore cop is recruited by a secretive government agency to help stop what seems to be a Middle Eastern terrorist plot to flood the world with a plague of zombies that spread quite easily via victims being bitten. The action is non-stop, the main character, Jack Ledger, is quite well drawn, the plot points are a bit of a stretch but well within thriller limits. One of the most interesting aspects is that Ledger's best friend, who also gets drawn into the fight, is a therapist who helps cops deal with the stress of their jobs, especially when they are forced to shoot someone. Throughout the novel, he's talking both Ledger and us through what it means to be a human being caught up in a whirlwind of violence and death, helping his friend and the other agents cope with what they're going thought at that basic human level. Very interesting and very well done. Overall, an exciting and surprisingly thoughtful read. Highest marks in the summer reading sweepstakes. I anxiously await sequels. (Yeah, I know. Zombies and humour. Zombies are strangely funny, it seems. Argh.) Anne Rice, Joss Whedon and the makers of the Underworld series of films certainly have a lot to answer for – turning the vampire genre from a true subset of the horror genre into a rather lame subset of the romance genre. Not that I have any problem with romantic vampires – as long as they're part of a larger field of vampire fiction that also includes evil, predatory vampires. My problem is that the dark supernatural romance seems to be edging out all the rest. This brings us to Jeaniene Frost's Destined for an Early Grave . Not normally the kind of book I would read, a review copy just happened to land on my desk just as we were leaving for the cottage for a couple of weeks of R&R.; So, I took it along. I also read it. Mind you, there were several times in the first 50 pages that I was sorely tempted to hurl it across the room. The romance stereotype characters drove me crazy. The sexy, feisty and tough yet strangely goofy and insecure female lead; the tall, dark, brooding and yet strangely sensitive male lead. The tall, dark, brooding and yet strangely deranged villain. Yeah, they're all there: Buffy, Angel and Spike. The plot and setting also hit all the highlights in the feudal gothic hit parade. Hereditary ruling classes, byzantine rules and regulations that you must just die for, a heroine with secret powers that happens to be the key to everyone's plans. In the end, though, I did end up finishing the book – as stereotypical as the characters were, the plot had enough twists to keep me turning the pages even if the ending was dead predictable. Of course, it didn't hurt that initially I wasn't quite sure I'd brought enough books at the cottage so I more or less felt I had to read it. In different circumstances I might not have made it much past page 10 much less 50 or 350. Sort of recommended. Barely. And speaking of evil vampires, I have enjoyed David Wellington's work and I do look forward to reading the new Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan book, The Strain . It is out there, I just wish the proportions were a bit different. Joss Whedon and George Jeanty's The Long Way Home is the first graphic novel collection of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 series from Dark Horse. When the Buffy tv show first came out, my sons were quite small so my wife and I weren't really adding any new tv shows to our roster. But the show did make a psychic impression because a lot of people I knew were watching it and reported loving it. So, now that the kids are older and all the seasons are on DVD, my wife and I basically gorged ourselves on Buffy, watching all seven tv seasons on DVD over about a seven month period -- watching the last couple of seasons in about two weeks each. The season-long story arcs made them very addictive and easy to watch the episodes in bunches. Well, we finished the apocalyptic Season 7 a few weeks ago and it seemed like a good time to give the comics version Season 8 a try. So, what do I think? So far, pretty good but not amazing. There's about a 12 month gap between the end of S7 and the first issue here where some sort of Slayer organization has been set up in Scotland and that whole process is really glossed over very quickly. I could have used a bit more of a explanation of what went on with that, even if it did slow down the opening action. Which actually makes sense, of course, as the tv show never really worried about using up screen time filling in character relationships and back story bits. If anything, that's my big complaint so far with S8, that the characters and their personal stories are really getting short shrift in favour of some rather frenetic and disjointed action. It's understandable that some of the pacing habits of tv would have to change in comics, but so far I'm really missing the characters and their lives and personal stories. The overall arc of S8 seems to focus on something called Twilight, and I do sort of see where they're going, but I'm really looking forward to getting a better sense of where they're taking the characters, in particular some of the minor characters like Dawn, who somehow has been transformed into a giant due to a romantic liaison with something called a "thricewise," whatever that is. In fact, that would have been a great story in itself. As it is, it seems to be an excuse to bring back the whiny, petulant Dawn of S6 rather than the more mature young woman from S7 -- a step back as far as I'm concerned. Giles as well is more or less missing in action so far too. I found the storytelling a bit choppy, disjounted and flashbacky, an odd choice for a book that is presumably aimed quite a bit at comics neophytes, drawn in by the Buffy connection. Something a lot more linear and straightforward would seem to be better suited, especially for the first volume. So, potential, yes. I'll be reading the rest of the series, for sure, but I'm a little concerned by the first collection that Whedon lost track of what made Buffy such a crossover hit the intervening years between S7 & S8. Slaughter, Karin. Blindsighted. New York: HarperTorch, 2002. 389pp. Slaughter, Karin. Beyond reach. New York: Dell, 2008. 573pp . I don't have too much to say about the two books at hand, both by the aptly-named Karin Slaughter. Blindsighted is a fairly typical serial killer novel while Beyond Reach is a fairly typical crime thriller. Although they don't necessarily have high body counts, the violence and mayhem is intense and brutal, earning the author both her name and her crime writer stripes. Both are well-written and exciting, with a common cast of characters which Slaughter carries from book to book in a couple of vaguely overlapping series. The plots are clever, the pace is breakneck, the characters well drawn, the action at times shocking and surprising. I've read three of her books ( Triptych last summer) and I think I'll be reading a whole lot more.
The scenario is again played on a 2' x 2' skirmish board. The terrain is all woods, with a few odd boulders thrown in, and small stones used as encounter markers. Only Figaro and Manon start on the board (in the lower right-hand corner). There is a thick fog shifting and swirling about, so visibility is limited to d10+4" and changes each turn. The visibility on each turn is indicated in parentheses at the start of that turn's description.

Well, as you might have guessed, I wasn’t exactly Mr. Popular growing up. At recess the kids used to crowd around me and start chanting “Wordy-Wordy-Word-Butt” and claim they’d only stop it if I said the “F” word. Of course, as soon as I did that, they’d grab it and show it to the teacher and I’d end up with detention for a week.
I made some major changes to my schedule so a good part of my afternoon was spent packaging up textbooks to send back to Amazon, then ordering new ones.  And by "ordering new ones" I mean stealing Matt's IFP books from last year.  Shhhhhhh
For a guy that loves a good constitutional debate, talk about yummy! McCain’s Canal Zone Birth Prompts Queries About Whether That Rules Him Out appears in the New York Times today. (The article is written by Carl Hulse and my father read the article in The Grand Rapids Press and was kind enough to show it to me). Well, read the article, but the issue is the US Constitution says you must be a "natural-born citizen" to be president. So, since John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone, the issue is in debate.
A couple of years ago I spent a wonderful week in Tel Aviv helping with the first Oracle BAM implementation in Israel.  Although everyone I interacted spoke better English than I did, the screens and data for the implementation were all in Hebrew, meaning the Hebrew alphabet.  Over the week I learnt to recognize a few Hebrew words, enough to enable me to test what we were doing.  So I knew SOA Suite worked OK with non-English and non-Latin character sets so I was suspicious recently when a customer was having data corruption of non-Latin characters.  On investigation it turned out that the data received correctly in the SOA Suite, but then it was corrupted after being stored in the database.
It worked, but had several significant drawbacks. Since it was an animal protein, there was the risk of an immune response. Anyone who desired collagen injections was skin tested and waited weeks to make sure they didn’t react to the treated protein. In addition, collagen was expensive and only lasted up to several months. For many years this was all that was available to the plastic surgeon in the realm of fillers.
I've only ever really had like maybe 7 people actually read my story and talk to me about it or mention something about it. Other then that. Everyone else I gave my story too never once even mentioned it. The two girls I worked with back in college always read my stuff and walk talk to me about the chapter. My one writing buddy. He and I used to exchange stories all the time and help each other out. My ex back in college. She actually would sit there and read my story next to me and then talk a little about it.
Let's see.... Today we talked a bit about reconciling a Buddhist practice or way of life with Western culture; not easy stuff.

I didn't attend this year's Photo Marketing Association (PMA) show, but as I read the coverage at PCMag and other places, a couple of trends were apparent to me. The first is a push for mid-size cameras, somewhere between point-and-shoot still cameras and the larger, traditional single lens reflex cameras (SLR); the second is a trend toward putting better quality sensors in high-end point-and-shoot cameras, even if that means a lower megapixel count.In the "in-between" category of cameras that are smaller than a traditional SLR but still offer things like interchangeable lenses, a lot of the interest has been in the Micro Four Thirds segment. Olympus and Panasonic are promoting this system, which still lets you interchange lens but does not use the mirror of an SLR, and thus has a smaller body.

I have been using Windows machines for 20 years.  I worked at Microsoft in 1992 when they launched Windows 3.1.  So, as you can see, I don't come by my decision to switch to a Mac lightly.  So why did I do it?  First, I have had it with the system crashes that come out of now where.  And like many people, I am drawn to the clean design of the Apple computers.  And now of course that I have been using the iMac 24" for the past few months I now see what I was often told.  The software itself (Leopard) is more stable and faster than Windows.
The occasion today is to celebrate Hero's 75th Birthday and we had a family dinner in some traditional Chinese Restaurant in town which my sister recommended. Having squeezed in the past during such dinners to much discomfort, she decided that this time around, we'd separate into 2 tables with the siblings and Hero in 1 table, the kids and 3 maids in the other table. This arrangement made perfect sense because the kids are grown-ed up and its really impossible to squeeze in at the 'main' tables anymore. Food wise, we ordered identical fare for both tables.
If this had been a SyFy original, I'd have been impressed, but overall, it's a long TWILIGHT ZONE episode. The problem with a 97 minute episode is that it gives you way too much time to think, and every "surprise" plot point telegraphed itself far ahead of time.
