I am a flight att. and waitress and single mom. I work like a dog.I had been hurting for months and then began swelling and having red joints. In April I was diagnosed with RA and the doctor prescribed Humira. I had been taking Voltaren which mad no difference. Anyway, I was worried about the side effect of a lowered immune system. So far, no colds, but I cut my hands at work(paper cuts) and they become angry and swollen, not healing at all. I also experienced complete numbness in both arms and hands the night after my second injection. Has anyone else taken Humira? How is your immunity? My joints and pain are so much better. Only 2 fingers still swollen and red. I have to be able to stand 13-14 hrs about 6 days a week. Please let me know about Humiraâ€¦.Thanks.
