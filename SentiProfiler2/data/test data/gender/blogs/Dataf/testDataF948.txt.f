It was never so much what he said, it was what he did not say. He woke up and got ready for work and said nothing. He came home from work and changed his clothes, lay on the couch until dinner and said nothing. He came to the dinner table with a newspaper and read it instead of talking to or looking at his children. After dinner he lay on the couch and watched television until he went to bed, saying nothing. I mean this literally. The man could go for months and say nothing to any of his kids. He tried very hard to ignore my mother as well. When I was in my teens my conversations with him revolved around him telling me to pick up the telephone, or that a friend was at the door, or to not play the music so loud, and basically that was it. Not only did he emotionally cut himself off from me by not speaking, he rarely made eye contact with me either. (This is also how he treated my brothers, although as the only girl, I got the worst of it)
