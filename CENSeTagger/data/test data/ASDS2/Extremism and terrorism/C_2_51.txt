RISE (AND FALL) OF THE GRAVE WORSHIPPER MILITIAS IN SOMALIA (part 1): - After the invasion of the Nasara Crusader Ethiopian army on Somalia ,on US orders,as we all know,the Jihad in Somalia became more virulent.Grassroots mujahideen,especially those in the Youth movement of The Islamic Courts Union(ICU),were convinced that earlier attempts by senior ICU leaders of distancing from Sheikh Usama,just for the sake of not angering USA,would never satisfy them. The mujahideen regrouped,continued their attacks on ethiopian army and traitor militias,and MOST IMPORTANTLY ,PURIFIED THEIR AQEEDAH,AS PER THE SALAF AS SALIH.This time,the youth movement,now almost totally independent of the ICU and known as Harakat al Shabab al Mujahideen,implemented shariat in whatever land they conquered. As per shariat,they destroyed over-decorated tombs of sufis. It was too bad for business for the grave-worshipping cult,that encashed the tombs for generations.
