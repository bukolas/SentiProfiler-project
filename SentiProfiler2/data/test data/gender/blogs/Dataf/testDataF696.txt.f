Two of your children get into an argument and when you can't figure out which one is fibbing, you send them into another room to "get their story straight" reminding them that whoever is at fault will be punished. When they return, they have both come to the conclusion that it was the child who was sitting beside you on the couch the whole time that was responsible for starting the fight.
