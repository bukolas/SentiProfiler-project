First Japan , now Paris. IKEA have kitted out four Parisian subway stations with their sofas and lamps for two weeks. The main point of the publicity is to demonstrate the quality and strength of IKEA products through the ‘ bum test ’ of thousands of Parisians. There's more behind the campaign at the PSFK blog If you're going through St. Lazare, Champs-Elysées Clémenceau, Concorde, and Opéra Metro stations, you'll have a comfortable rest on the platforms. Just hope that the Parisian homeless don't catch on to this too quickly, as IKEA may find they'll also be testing whether their sofas are stain resistant. There's a great set of pictures on Flickr by Les Favoris where you can see commuters spending more time looking at the sofas rather than actually sitting on them. Thanks to FreshPlastic for finding the IKEA links. After IKEA in Kobe, Japan put their furniture in train carriages (see above), we just need IKEA in the UK to get in on the act. It would make that wait for your delayed London Underground train, much more bearable. It's only one step on from the current round of Homebase TV ads where a station in Carlisle is decorated! Come on IKEA, London awaits. London Underground's former managing Director has had preliminary discussions with Tube Lines about possibly becoming the contractor's chief exec. This could be interesting as O'Toole strongly criticised Tube Lines while he was in office. Perhaps it needs someone like him to help the current acrimonious disputes between LU & Tube Lines . Tube Lines hasn't had a permanent chief executive since February 12, when Dean Finch resigned & became chief executive of National Express. Tube Lines, which works on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, has been the sole surviving contractor since July 2007 when Metronet went into administration. Tim O'Toole left the London Underground in April last year and returned to Philadelphia to spend more time with his family. David Begg, Tube Lines' chairman, says he had the highest regard for Tim O'Toole's reputation. But added: " I haven't offered Tim O'Toole a contract, so I cannot say whether or not Tim O'Toole is coming ." However according to the Evening Standard a Tube Lines spokeswoman said: " I can confirm that we are in contractual negotiations with Tim O'Toole over the chief executive's job. We are hoping to conclude these discussions soon ." The FT said that Boris Johnson declined to comment, although they believe that Tim O'Toole has also held discussions with him. A number of people were lucky enough to bag tickets to a walking tour of the world's first tunnel under a navigable river. Victorians last walked through the tunnel in 1865 & now, 145 years later it was opened to the public for two days. The tickets sold out incredibly quickly, but luckily for us a number of people have blogged & very kindly shared photography. Matthew Knight aka webponce has an amazing set of pictures from the Thames Tunnel Tour . I love the detail of the original brickwork on the archways below. He said " I've always wanted to walk down a Tube line, and to be able to walk along the Marc Brunel Thames Tunnel was even more special - as the world's first underwater tunnel. Much of the original tunnel is still visible at the Rotherhithe end. It is amazing to think there were stalls and shops down here. Thanks to the guides who showed us around. The Thames Tunnel is an underwater tunnel, built beneath the River Thames in London, United Kingdom connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping. It measures 35 feet (11 m) wide by 20 feet (6 m) high and is 1,300 feet (396 m) long, running at a depth of 75 feet (23 m) below the river's surface (measured at high tide) ." Peter Watts was also on the tour this morning " along with every other transport nerd ". He said: " the tunnel reopened as a foot tunnel for what we were assured will be the very last time in its history, which is just the sort of hyperbole I like to hear on a Friday morning.... The tunnel is now pretty much indistinguishable from any other underground line. The only sense you get that you are heading under the river is that it is rather damp and chilly. Although most of the tunnel’s original brickwork has been concreted over, there are some areas where you can still the original bricks, beautiful but damaged. " Darryl Chamberlain from 853 blog also went along and said " The brickwork had concrete applied to it in the 1990s to protect the tunnel – said to be the leakiest on the Underground network – but after a row broke out between London Transport and preservation agencies, a small part close to Rotherhithe station was left alone. Rather than a reminder of how the tunnel was, the existence of the exposed bri just seems to justify the decision to cover it in concrete in the first place ." Peter continued: " Arches bisect the tunnel throughout its length. These were originally used as small shops, as the tunnel became the world’s first underwater shopping arcade. These spaces are tiny, and would have been cramped, dark, cold and damps places to work from. I imagine they are rather like those booth-cum-shops you get along Brixton’s Atlantic Road, where people flog phonecards and reggae from the stairwells of blocks of flats. Here, though, you can get a sense of the detailing that distinguishes so much Victorian architecture . Peter's visited a number of other subterranean parts of London (deep-level Tube shelter at Chancery Lane) & you can learn about what got him initially hooked at the rest of his great blog post . Thanks to both him, Darryl Chamberlain & Matthew for sharing the experience & photos. If you managed to bag a ticket, it would be great to hear what you thought too. Remember the days when you could smile smugly in a pub quiz to answer " What's unique about St John's Wood London Underground station? " It's the only Tube station that doesn't share any letters with the word mackerel. A couple of week's ago, you might remember I asked what was unique about Pimlico Tube . Only one person worked out that it was the only station that didn't share any letters with the word badger! Now some clever person, Ben Green, has built a great time wasting tool " Badgers in Pimlico " so you can type in words and see which stations do not contain its letters. Amazingly there's only one station that doesn't have any letters of the word "Underground" in it (thanks to @qwghlm for that) and that Debden is unique in at least two ways (thanks to Paul Clarke & Richard George for that). Have minutes of fun seeing which other Tube stations are unique . Thanks to Fimb for the initial heads up on this! In a bid to save £16m each year, LU has announced it will be losing around 700-800 roles on the Tube. In a press release today (where the focus is on " vision for a safe, efficient and transformed Tube " - sad how lots of visionary releases tend to hide bad news for other people), London Underground stated there would be no compulsory redundancies and they would look to re-focus staff to areas of greater customer need. No changes will be introduced without consultation with staff and trade unions. It's unlikely the unions will take news of cuts lightly, so I bet the likelihood of threats of industrial action to be high. Union leaders have already told the BBC of their disappointment with Bob Crow leader of the RMT in bullish mode & dismissive of LU's safety reassurances: " If these cuts to jobs are bulldozed through by Transport for London it will turn London's Tube stations into a muggers' paradise ." London Underground were clear to state that there would be no ticket office closures. It was rumoured earlier this year that 1,000 jobs would go due to ticket office losses . However the value of service provided at ticket stations, particularly in peak hours, was noted. " The LU proposals would also ensure, therefore, that all stations with a ticket office will continue to do so, with opening hours reduced in some areas to reflect the decline in demand but remaining open at the busiest times to serve customers ." However Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the TSSA, said Boris Johnson had betrayed staff: " He was elected promising to keep ticket offices fully open and fully staffed. "He has now broken that promise. We shall fight this all the way if any of our members are threatened with compulsory redundancy ." Tube officials said the cuts would include 100 managers, 450 ticket office posts and up to 200 other jobs. Basically we have the " huge success " of the Oyster card to thank for the job cuts. Since its launch there has been a sharp decline in ticket sales at station offices with just one in 20 journeys paid for at the counter. iPhone users can submit refund claims for London Underground delays pretty quickly with the launch of two apps. Under the Customer Charter, if you're delayed by more than 15 minutes, you're entitled to claim the cost of your single journey on the Tube. TfL's website actually is fine for making a claim , but with an iPhone app, many people might be more likely to remember to do it. You can literally claim while your delay takes place. The company behind Tube Refund , one of the apps, says that there were approximately 1,996 delays across the Tube network last year (38 delays a week). Hopefully you're not going to get that amount personally, but the which only costs 59p, could pay for itself pretty quickly. The other app iRefund is $0.99 has fewer ratings than Tube Refund. If you have an iPhone give one a try, when you're next delayed. They'll make a useful edition to the other London Underground iPhone apps reviewed last year. Thanks to TechCrunch for the heads up on this. In the ongoing funding row with Tube Lines upgrade work, TfL are considering legal action after arbiter, Chris Bolt says London Underground has to raise £4,465m for PPP costs. In a final determination of the costs, the arbiter believes that Tube Lines' increased estimate by £65m for the cost of the next seven and half years of work is correct. Boris Johnson & TfL are none too happy about this and with a rebel rousing yell, Boris said " The Arbiter has ruled that the costs should be £4.46bn, thus demonstrating that Tube Lines' breathtaking original demand for £6.8bn was simply an attempt at daylight robbery. "Londoners will also be outraged that the Tube upgrades promised to them are now threatened. "Simply put, we are being asked to write a blank cheque in order to prop up an ailing and failing Tube Lines, and to guarantee massive and secretive payments of £400m to its shareholders, Ferrovial and Bechtel. "In other countries this would be called looting, here it is called the PPP ." The fighting talk continues with " We will fight this to the last and are seeking urgent advice on the Arbiter's idea to pass Tube Lines' obligations to raise finance on to London's fare and taxpayers. "We are therefore examining all our options, including legal remedies. " Tube Lines are quietly saying that co-operation is needed " It will be essential that it (the contract) is underpinned with a strong partnership between Tube Lines and London Underground and that both parties embrace the parameters of the agreement. " Unlikely with talk of a legal fight & Boris's sparring words. Andrew Cleaves, Tube Lines' acting chief executive, said " It is clear that the Arbiter has relied on international benchmarking to help drive down public spending and is expecting both us and London Underground to become more efficient still by adopting some of the delivery methods used by other, more modern Metro systems around the world. This will require a step change in the way that Tube Lines and London Underground work together. We will wholeheartedly welcome working more closely with LU to simplify and modernise working practices on the Underground and give Tube passengers more, for less ." Also earlier in the week TfL's interim managing director Richard Parry wrote to Bolt warning that the missing £400m would have to be found by taxpayers, in the form of higher fares, or else planned upgrade work to the Piccadilly Line would have be shelved. In today's press release Parry said " The Jubilee and Northern line upgrades are seriously delayed and over budget as a result of Tube Lines' failure to deliver, a fact now confirmed by both the PPP Arbiter and an independent QC earlier this year ." Looks like the war of words could be moving to legal arena and in the meantime, us commuters continue to bear the brunt of the stupid PPP plan, with delays to upgrades & increased fares to fund the mess. Microsoft's search engine Bing kicks off its UK TV advertising tonight with a London Underground setting. Looks like the simple question of where to catch a Tube to Euston is taken to extremes - unless they've been looking at the Human Body as a Tube Map diagram. Hopefully, this won't lead to a round of information overload for people asking for directions on the Tube. And welcome if you've come here, after searching for the London Underground on Bing. You might not find what you're looking for, but hopefully can have fun on the way.
