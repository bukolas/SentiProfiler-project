Like many customers, I thought John's Place was strictly a tire sales and service shop. When you have an "exotic" car you are somewhat limited when you need tires, wheels and service. The first time we had a flat, we called around to other stores. We were told that the tire would have to be shipped from Kansas or Texas and it would take days and cost $$$. Fortunately, someone told us about Duxler. When we called we learned Duxler, a.k.a., John's Place, had the tire in stock and they could install it that day.
