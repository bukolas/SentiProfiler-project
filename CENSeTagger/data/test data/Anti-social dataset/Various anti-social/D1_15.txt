Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on other. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this -- and I have, countless times, in just about every act I've committed -- and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. i gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has ben no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing...
