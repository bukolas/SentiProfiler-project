Recently, spm resultt released. Those people around me, have a great result. This make me stress. I stress, not because i scared and hate the feeling of lose. I stress as i don't want to disappoint my parents. They have been putting a lots of hope on me, since i get i a great result at kinder garden. It also mean, my childhood is in stress. Though, i appreciate what they have done. Thanks mum, dad. Although stress, I suppose i will go through it by myself. I will try my best to not disappoint u all. Bro, thanks for your support. You are the best brother in the world. SPM,Me, Rainie, never scare of YOU. As what Asson say, angel is always by my side.
