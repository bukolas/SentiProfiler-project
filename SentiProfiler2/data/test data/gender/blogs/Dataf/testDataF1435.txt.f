What is my end goal? To change something, somehow. Or, at least, to understand better, mejor, and in a way that can contribute to some change being made. Because if nothing gets done... so what? I don't want to have just gotten paid to write a big extra-curricular research paper that will do nothing for anybody. I write, this summer, to help myself next spring. I write, next spring, to help us understand. I write, now, for the joy of it, because I am in love with the process. Because this is part of how I process, how I think, how I act.
