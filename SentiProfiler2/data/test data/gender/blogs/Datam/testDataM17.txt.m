There is a general belief that religion and spirituality are outside the scope of examination using scientific methods. I beg to disagree. Science comprises observation, theory and verification. All human experience is based on observation. In ordinary life, the result of observations, over a long period of time, is called experience. However science requires the observations to be objective, systematic, accurate making conscious effort to reduce errors by repeating the experiments and having it reviewed by peers. Similarly the difference scientific theory and others is that it constructs a theoretical model based on logic and mathematics. This model has to be consistent with the observed facts. The last stage is verification during which a prediction is made and a new experiment is done to verify whether this is correct. For instance theory of relativity predicted that light rays would bend when they pass very near the Sun. This was verified and found to be correct.
