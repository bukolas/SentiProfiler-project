the blog has been quite neglected lately well ever since i started twittering lol sad i know but don't fear i have not forgotten about my ol' blog so whats new and exciting lately well lets see i have been elected into the board of directors at the local UU church which is cool working on a new play that starts in mid april gonna be working on a movie set in the near future and eevopets my long lost virtual petsite is once again getting reborn it's been resurrected twice now maybe this time we'll get it right umm lets see the girlfriend that i currently have is great i'm a bit hesitant to go into details because well you know what happen the last time i made a relationship annoucement on here she like flipped out on me (the x-gf) and we were history within the hour of the post so yea this one is pretty special so i'll leave it at that. as you can tell i'm still grammatically incorrect it's only because i'm too lazy to use punctuation except for a period here and there lol. i relized recently that the anniversary of my separation or betrayal however you choose to view it passed without knowlegde this year which is a good sign i guess still have bitter feelings towards andrea about it but i can't really complain about my life at the current time because i have everything i need for the most part friends a job roof over my head decent transportation food my bills are getting paid social networks i get out and do things living an active life and i have smokes dew and a snickers what more does a person need right? even tho i have all this and i should... i do.... consider myself lucky... just still something fills missing or missed i guess i'm happy tho i don't even know what happy is but i would guess its something like this i know the girl i'm with now would never betray me like all the others in my past it's just not in her nature like "others" she's untainted unjaded pure of heart i like that. anyways moving on college is going well it's been a rough semester i'm taking 17 credits this time and it's taking it's toll on me but i'm being a good lil trooper and getting the job done oh and i got a new phone as well i love it it's the samsung moment w/google and i have right to find something that it won't let me do it's truly the perfect fone feel free to call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX ( if you see x's it's because it's being blocked you wasn't choosen to recieve it contact me if you wanna know why) ok well i know you are sick of reading my gramatically challenged post and i'm sick of writing so as i always say i'm sure there is more to talk about and share but i don't for now keep up to date with me by adding 1prdpgn to your twitter feed l8ter all!
