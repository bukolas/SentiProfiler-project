Loosu girl.. Keeps messing her account and creates a new one every few months. One good thing is that i get to write a totally new testi every time (which has been due for 4 months i think) One of my closest friends from college. Knows even my deepest secrets and keeps them to herself which is the quality i like the most in her. Even after starting to live on the opposite sides of the globe it is quite surprising how we maintain close contact. This jantu could be bubbly one moment and get into the darkest possible mood within the blink of an eye. But, off late she has been showing great resistance to those dark moods even in times of stress. Great going anoo keep it up. She tends to be the person I call on when I am down and she tends to lift my spirits every time I chat with her. Dunno wat I will do without this innocent and cute little devil. Keep smiling as always
