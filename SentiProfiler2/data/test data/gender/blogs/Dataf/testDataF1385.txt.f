I love Continental Airlines! They never disappoint me and I am so thrilled with their service. I travel a lot and I just have thumbs up for this outstanding airline. I recommend all travelers to go through Continental Airlines. They have great employees that are so professional and so caring for us travelers. I feel special and great traveling all the time through them. If I would use another airline, it would be because I am forced to if Continental Airlines didn't take me to my destination. There are many different ways to earn mileage in this airlines.
