In case you don't already know, last night I won "Puckett's Rising Star" competition.  This was a contest held at Puckett's Grocery in Franklin among Nashville songwriters judging on song quality and performance.   The contest had three rounds; 8 seperate opening rounds, a semifinal round of sixteen, and a final round of four writers.  (about 120 writers total)
