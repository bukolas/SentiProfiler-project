notice i dont write under an anonymous name. it's because im not scared of any repercussions. if black people want to get pissed, fuck em. if you racist white guys wanna come kill me or something then so be it. maybe i should be lynched with the rest of them. If we focus our hate to a common goal, something will change. If we just keep it broadly aimed at individual races then no one will listen to us.
