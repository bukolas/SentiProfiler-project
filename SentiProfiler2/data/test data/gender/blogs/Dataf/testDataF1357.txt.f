Today is such a beautiful day! It's a day to celebrate friendship, it's a day to celebrate life and it's most definitely a day to celebrate love! I've always believed that love is something that we should show all throughout the year. Why wait for one special day to let the people in your life that matter know just how important they are to you? I try to make it my business to show my affection and appreciation all year long, but it is kinda fun to make that little extra effort on this one day.One of my favourite quotes is "You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams." -Dr. SeussWho knew Dr. Seuss was so thoughtful, lol, but I couldn't agree with him more!HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY everyone....it's gonna be a lovely day:-) I came across this song, "Are You Listening?" produced by Kirk Franklin. Along with a many of today's best gospel artists , he recorded this song to help to raise money for the people in Haiti in conjunction with UNICEF. Not only is the song absolutely beautiful, but the proceeds are obviously going to a great cause. Listen, enjoy and do your part to help if you haven't already done so. I remember years ago before I had a blackerry, before I knew anything about having this type of instant access to the worldwide web, to e-mails, to google
