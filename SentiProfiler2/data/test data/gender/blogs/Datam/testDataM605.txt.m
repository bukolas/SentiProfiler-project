Where do I start the testimonial for a very important person in my life? We know each other for the past 7 years and have been really really close for the past 4 years. First I thought she would be a person who is shy, unfriendly and stuff but later when we became close realized what a caring person she is nu.We have spent so much time together in the name of "combined studies" chit chatting about all the gossips on earth. All the last minute study at her house, going at 10 pm on the last day before the exam for xerox sema fun those days. Not only her, the total family takes care of me. Her mom is the best cook on earth, keeps giving me something or the other. Her sister has been really caring and the nakkals and teasing both of us do to each other chance e ella. At the end of the four eventful college years, the memories alone stand. We may depart, and chose a different career in life but the distance is going to make the friendship bond much stronger.
