Had been on a cabin trip weekend of Sep 20th. The cabin was about 2 ½ hours drive from Seattle. What started out as a 10 person trip eventually came down to 4. You know how these things go. People dropping out at the last minute with some excuse or the other. I also tried my best to get out of it but with no luck. What was my excuse – well I had none – that was the problem. I have no complaints now. It was four guys in a cabin all by ourselves. Now don't jump ahead of yourselves and get the wrong idea.
