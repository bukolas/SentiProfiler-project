I arrived in Israel exactly a week ago and haven't been able to find enough time to sit at a computer or upload my photos. 
I spent my first two days with family (grandparents, uncles aunts and cousins) in Tel Aviv. 

Then I went off on a 2 day seminar in Jerusalem to prepare for my internship. All in all, those 2 days were mostly spent on touring Jerusalem and the old city. I felt like being on Birthright-Taglit again. A group of about 40 people from all over the world gathered to prepare for their next 2 months in Israel by learning about political issues, examining cultural differences, and learning about the Israeli workplace. 

We toured Jerusalem in the old city and City of David. Jerusalem used to be completely religious. Today it is a mix of everything, but still keeping it's religious history, and marking it's name as the "holy city" for many religions. It's divided into four sections of Jews, Muslims, Christians, and Armenians. 
I spent time on Ben-Yehuda street, a touristy spot with lots of restaurants, shops, and local music. The next day I went to the Western Wall (for the millionth time). We happened to go on a Thursday when lots of Bar-Mitzvahs were going on so it was very busy. It is common to write a note with a prayer or a wish and place it inside the blocks of the kotel (the Western Wall). Every time I go there I get annoyed that the wall is separated by men and women, yet he women's side is about half the size of the men's. I also tend to forget about small traditions in the kotel such as walking backwards as you leave the wall so you can face god.
