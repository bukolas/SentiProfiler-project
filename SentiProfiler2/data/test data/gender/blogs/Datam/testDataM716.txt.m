I didn't have a lot of studio time today, so I looked for a small project I could quickly finish. I'd done the drawing for this painting about 6 months ago, and thought I'd be able to complete the underpainting in the short time available. After about a week, this layer should be dry, and I'll be able to paint the color layer. I think it should be a nice little painting; I'm looking forward to it. Most of the in-progress images I post here are of work on the final color layer, so I thought I'd show a little window into work on the underpainting (above). Here's the completed underpainting: Tomorrow I'll be starting on a very, very fun project. I'll write a quick post about it in the evening. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 6 x 11 inches Actually, this painting is done. I won't post final images of it until it has dried and been varnished. It's probably hard to appreciate with this lower-quality shot, but there's a depth and richness to the color that I'm very pleased with, especially the copper, which has become one of my favorite things to paint. I managed to finish it despite the torrential downpours we got here in Eastern Massachusetts; about 8 inches of rain in the last 48 hours - falling on saturated soil from another recent storm. I now have a nice duck pond where my back yard used to be, and water is flowing freely into my basement. However, so far the pumps have done their job, and it's been more of a nuisance than anything else. Others nearby were far less fortunate... mandatory evacuations, submerged automobiles, and all that. Since I barely slept last night dealing with the water, I'm exhausted; think I'll head off to bed early. More progress, and getting close to the finish. At this point, the biggest thing I need to worry about is anchoring the objects to the surface they're sitting on. Objects which aren't properly painted in relation to their context never feel like they have the proper weight and gravity, and as a result sit awkwardly in the painting. And that, of course, just wouldn't do... I wish you all a great weekend. Jeffrey Hayes Work In Progress 5 x 11 inches Here is further progress on my current painting. I really like the idea of building paintings around 2 opposed and unequal groups of objects. It seems to lend the composition some built-in tension and intrigue. I'm almost tempted to call the painting "Culture Clash" or something similar, though that's probably more amusing to me than it is to most others. Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 5 x 11 inches This is the very latest piece I've been working on. I don't ordinarily work on one larger piece immediately after finishing another larger piece, but I'd completed the underpainting for this some months ago, and just wanted to get it done. After this, I'll be working on a very cool project; more on that in a few days. After my recent cancer experience , I got a lot of messages of concern and support, so I thought I'd pass along some good news. Today I had my first physical since then, and overall I'm in very good shape. So... back to work for me; I'd like to finish this one as soon as I can!
