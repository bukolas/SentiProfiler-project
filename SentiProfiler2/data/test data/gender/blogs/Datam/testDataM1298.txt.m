I had severe carpal tunnel syndrome and was headed straight under the knife, but truly didnt want surgewry... A friend told me about a 'platelet injection' made from your own blood.. i as sceptical & the pain doc in denton, tx told me it was purely experimental but it worked!!.. within a few weeks my pain deminished to the point i didnt notice it or didnt have it anymore. I cant say this is the answer for everyone.. but it surely worked for me :) Best of luck to you friend!
