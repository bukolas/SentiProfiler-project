Today's menu: Rib-a-cue, whole wheat bun, corn, apple, (milk). So the "rib-a-cue" looks bad, but when I opened the package, it smelled terrific and it actually tasted really good. Today I was offered a choice (!!) of the rib-a-cue or lasagna. I didn't see the lasagna sitting out so I decided on the rib-a-cue, which was sitting in a big stack for the kids to take. I'm starting to become friends with the lunch room personnel. I was always nice to them before but we're definitely establishing a relationship! Someone commented that I'm eating lunch everyday.... if they only knew the whole story!
