" The lead single from the Ivy League-educated duo, Jukebox , is the antithesis of Paul Simon's “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.” Atop a sparse club-banger with an undeniable, snaking bassline, rapper Naledge slithers around – doing his best to get pretty ladies to crack smiles (and hopefully more). With clever lines peppered throughout, the brash rapper just might have a winning chance. Double-O’s plush production on the duo’s latest full-length, Land of Make Believe, is completely sample-free, so that MC Lyte-assisted chorus on Jukebox actually features the femcee recreating a classic line from her 1989 track “Stop, Look, Listen.” " -- iTunes Store Genre: Hip Hop/Rap Download for Free! the fine print : Downloads posted on the Free iTunes Downloads blog are usually free for ~1 week.

" Iration hails from the Hawaiian Islands, and the group’s tunes embody an aloha spirit &#8212; breezy rock rhythms mixed with a heaping dose of reggae and dub flavor. Falling is a boy-meets-girl, boy-falls-head-over-heels tale anchored by Micah Pueschel’s sweet, boy-next-door vocals and buoyant guitar riff. We suggest ordering an umbrella-laden beverage and letting Iration’s catchy melodies soak in.

" Sarah Braverman, a financially strapped single mother, uproots her two teens, Amber and Drew, to move back home. Sarah is greeted by her father Zeek and mother Camille who are dealing with their own marital issues. Sister Julia is a successful corporate attorney trying to juggle work and motherhood alongside her stay-at-home husband, Joel. Younger brother Crosby must suddenly contend with accepting responsibility when an old flame Jasmine shows up and he must re-evaluate his priorities. And eldest brother Adam must relinquish his preconceived expectations about what constitutes a "normal" family when he and his wife Kristina and teen daughter Haddie learn that their eccentric son Max has been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome.

Episode Summary Single mother Sarah (Lauren Graham, "Gilmore Girls") and her two children Amber (Mae Whitman, "In Treatment") and Drew (Miles Heizer, "ER") are moving back home with her parents Zeek (Craig T. Nelson, "Family Stone," "Coach") and Camille (Bonnie Bedelia, "Heart Like a Wheel"). Sarah's sister and complete antithesis, Julia (Erika Christensen, "Traffic") is a successful corporate attorney trying to juggle work and motherhood, alongside her stay-at-home husband, Joel (Sam Jaeger, "Eli Stone"). Commitment-phobe Crosby (Dax Shepard, "Baby Mama"), Sarah’s younger brother, must accept adult responsibility when an old flame Jasmine (Joy Bryant "Antwone Fisher") shows up unexpectedly. Meanwhile, Adam (Peter Krause, "Six Feet Under"), the oldest Braverman sibling, his wife Kristina (Monica Potter, "Trust Me") and teenage daughter, Haddie (Sarah Ramos, "American Dreams"), learn that their eccentric son and Haddie’s little brother, Max (Max Burkholder, "Brother and Sisters"), is diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome. Although each sibling and family has its own share of life to grapple with, perhaps this reunion is the push they need to help each other pick up the pieces and focus on the everyday challenges that families face while raising children and starting over.
