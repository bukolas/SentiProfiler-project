Alex Chilton died today from a heart attack. For those of you who don't know who he was, he was one of the primary members of Big Star, a band I fell in love with only fairly recently. He wrote some of the most modern-sounding music from the early 70's, unfortunately, Big Star wasn't as large a commercial success as they deserved to be, releasing only three albums before a long break from recording as a band. It didn't help that their recording company didn't give them a fair break either.
