Vodafone Group Plc and Bharti Airtel Ltd. were among nine companies that applied to take part in auctions for India’s third-generation mobile-phone services as the South Asian nation seeks to raise money to cut the deficit.

Vodafone Essar Ltd., the Indian unit of the world’s biggest mobile-phone company, and Bharti, India’s biggest wireless operator, were also among 11 companies that applied to participate in auctions for airwaves to run broadband wireless services, India’s department of telecommunications said in a statement today.

India is counting on the proceeds from the auctions to help narrow the fiscal deficit at a 16-year high. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has pledged to cut the deficit to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product in the year starting April 1 from 6.9 percent of GDP in the previous year, the sharpest reduction in 19 years.

The sale could net the Indian government as much as $11.4 billion, Kotak Institutional Equities analyst Rohit Chordia, wrote in a report on March 15. “This would provide the government scope to lower fiscal deficits by about 0.3 percentage points of GDP.”

Competition among phone companies at the bidding could “stretch balance sheets amid the ongoing price wars,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Sunil Garg wrote in a report today. “We expect intense competition for the three available spectrum slots.”

Other Applicants

The other applicants for third-generation services were Aircel Ltd., controlled by Malaysia’s Maxis Communications Bhd., Etihad Etisalat Co., Saudi Arabia’s second-largest mobile-phone company, Idea Cellular Ltd., Reliance Telecom Ltd., S Tel Pvt., Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Videocon Telecommunications Ltd.

Norway-based Telenor SA’s Indian unit, Uninor, decided to skip India’s airwaves auction because it is yet to get the airwaves it has already paid for, and doesn’t believe there is enough demand in India for high-speed data services, the company said in a statement today.

“Telenor is making a conscious decision to preserve cash to focus on voice services for the huge rural population,” said Saeed Baradar, a telecommunications sales specialist at Societe Generale SA in London. “It’s an excellent strategy given the high-capacity, low-return nature of data services in a limited data market. I remain a buyer here.”.

Other countries have seen bidding for 3G auctions raise billions of dollars for their governments. The U.K. got $35 billion in 2000, while Germany received $46 billion at its sale.
