Welcome to Grade 1: "Alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?"&nbsp; "They look like dolphins !"&nbsp; " Whales , like whales!"&nbsp; "Yeah FISH !!!"&nbsp; "SHAAARKS!"&nbsp; "Ooo ooo, Mr. Bond , oooo???!" "Yes, Billy?" " Miga !&nbsp; They look like Miga !"&nbsp; "YEAH!!! MIGA !!!"&nbsp; " MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA !!!!" "Settle down CHILDREN! CHILDREN! Ugh..." Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved 's next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ridden one? 7)&nbsp; Isn't there an easier way to spell "ichthyosaur?"&nbsp; Maybe with less h's? I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; Speak up!&nbsp; We won't bite! ...much! And to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working, watch this They Might Be Giants " Nine Bowls of Soup ," staring Mr. Ichthyosaur... Some fantastically modern artwork from 1959. Use the contents drop-down menu to go the the “Where Evolution Stands Today” article. Check out the ads along the way. I adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah, feel nostalgic. Note: cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool. &nbsp; When I say "Therapod" what pops into your mind?&nbsp; A sharp-toothed, fleet-footed, flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur, right?&nbsp; Tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs, raptors... But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; To participate in this and future Time Capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; It's not too late to join in the fun! So without further ado, welcome to ART Evolved's Therizinosaur Gallery!

Therizinosaurus: a creature from Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a 'shape' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition. The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what I went with. My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period, China ) , using only pencil and paper.

Therizinosaur by Craig Dylke &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Giant Claw by Matthew Tames &nbsp; Here is a scene of a pair of Therizinosaurs protecting their nest. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus cheloniformis Feeding on Ginkgo by John Meszaros The&nbsp;geometrical stone structures&nbsp;in the background&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;columnar basalt formation&nbsp;such as can be found at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland or the Devil's Postpile in California. A Slap in the Face by Peter Bond A Therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing Alioramus remotus on a floodplain in Mongolia, 70-65 million years ago. I wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. Hopefully the Alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months. It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today . It's obviously missing a head. I've gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head. (I also haven't had time to work on it.) I am extremely happy with the rest of it. It came out perfect. It just needs a good head. &nbsp; We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs!&nbsp; Great job, everyone!&nbsp; The new poll is up on the right sidebar, so be sure to vote for July's Time Capsule ( wouldn't you just LOVE to draw ferns?! Erm... ) As for the next Gallery, the winner of that poll is ... ICHTHYOSAURS ! So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp; To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery, send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved@gmail.com . We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It's hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a "blog of note" on Google's official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates. We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork, wrote posts, or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start. Of course it doesn't end here. Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved! Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too. The new comers include: Rachael's lino print here Craig and Peter finally launch the first tandem Live Blog. Craig's efforts here . Peter's here . Zach's Therizinosaur has begun here . Sarah begins work on her Therizinosaur here . You can also still check out the previous efforts of: Tricia now has her "evolution" of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia's Obligatory Art Blog !!! Anthony live-blogged his Therizinosaur on Anthony Contoleon ’s Posterous ! It is still not too late to live blog, or more to the point have your live blogging effort advertised here! If you are planning on live blogging just let us know where (your site or blog that the updates will be appearing on) and when (with the date and rough time zone). You can either tell us in the comment section of this post or send us an email to artevolved@gmail.com . Till then happy live blogging! Just saw this and had to pass it on. (Thanks to Donna Braginetz of the Dinosaur Mailing list. There are very few platforms for up-and-coming paleoartists so this is very exciting: the John J. Lanzendorf Paleoart Award . Are you game? It's that time again, artists!&nbsp; Here is an overview of therizinosaurs in art, where we compile professional reconstructions of the animal in the next Gallery.&nbsp; March 1st, 2010 is the deadline for submissions for the Therizinosaur Time Capsule ! Therizinosaurs have had a long and convoluted history when it comes to reconstructions.&nbsp; Meat-eater or plant-eater?&nbsp; Prosauropod or coelurosaur?&nbsp; Skin or feathers?&nbsp; These questions led to wild variations in what a therizinosaur looked like!&nbsp; Below is a selection of therizinosaurs in art - click to enlarge ...

Meat-eating "therizinosaur" from the game Dino Crisis Let the comments and discussion about these wonderful maniraptorians begin!&nbsp; Therizinosaurs Go! With so many early submissions arriving for the Therizinosaurs (thanks to all those who've sent them in ALREADY!... this is the first time in ART Evolved history we've had pieces well over a month in advance!) it is time for those of us who haven't quite got there to remedy this situation. As of such prepare for some... LIVE Blogging! The schedule for this round (so far) is as follows: &nbsp; Tricia now has her "evolution" of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia's Obligatory Art Blog !!! Anthony live-blogged his Therizinosaur on&nbsp; Anthony Contoleon’s Posterous ! Sometime in this week both Craig and Peter will be starting what they are hoping to be a most epic (and first ever) duo person Live Blog. They will be starting up at about 8-9am Pacific Coast time. It is not too late to live blog, or more to the point have your live blogging effort added to the list above! If you are planning on live blogging just let us know where (your site or blog that the updates will be appearing on) and when (with the date and rough time zone). You can either tell us in the comment section of this post or send us an email to artevolved@gmail.com . Till then happy live blogging!
