There are a few things which characterise my friendship with Anoosha -
1) We simply have to fight every week. If at all we miss one week, we'll have an extra ferocious fight to compensate . This constitutes the most important part of our bonding 
2) We also have to have a mutual ego boosting session, where we compliment each other( coz noone else seems to do so)
3) We have to text each other everyday, even the most inane details of what we're doing- "I'm in the bus", "I'm in the train", "I'm bored", "So am I" etc. If this doesn't happen on a day to day basis, read point (1). Dishoom dishoom
Probably the best thing about my friendship with her is that I don't have to pretend..I can straight away say to her face what I think of her, and she returns the favour too :)
I personally feel that no relationship/friendship is ever complete without a fight, because you require that intimacy even to fight..That said, I'm gonna miss our weekly fights when this idiot runs away to do her MS. Love U!
