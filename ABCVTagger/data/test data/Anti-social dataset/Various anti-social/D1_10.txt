I don't get physically violent with people, but it seems that I get easily frustrated with people or situations.  I get frustrated to the point where I'm grinding my teeth and I have to leave the room so I don't say anything hurtful to anyone.  I wish I could learn not to get so upset about things.  I let little things build up until I feel like a pressure cooker and the lid is about to blow.
