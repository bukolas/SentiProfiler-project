Last Friday I was feeling brave. I decide I am going to march into Sonia Rykiel Saint-Germain and ask politely if I can take a few discrete photos for PB. After all I attended the show bla bla bla... They say I must speak to Presse upstairs... Up I go to the press office and wait a little bit tenuously, biting nails furiously, praying, hoping... Out comes Claire (who invited me to the show), Edouard (Communications) AND Lola ( Nathalie Rykiel's daughter!!!). They say to me, "We love your blog" (!!!) "Of course you can take pictures." I am melting... The SR store is spacious Every inch packed with divine SR items for every moment of the day. Lola tells me the windows always have books on display... Her grandmere, Sonia Rykiel has always gotten inspiration and ideas from books, so they are an important part of the store concept - here the mannikin wears a book on her head... Even the sweater shelves are like bookshelves! Of course there are the signature Sonia stripes... miam The skylight reflects those graphic stripes... A vendeuse pulls out a drawer for a customer full of Sonia treasures... miam miam I heart these red lips. Sonia's accessories have always been the wittiest and the best IMHO... I long to step into this snow globe and stay indefinitely... Nathalie Rykiel, Sonia's daughter, created her first collection, Sonia Rykiel Enfant while pregnant. Really they are a team: Sonia + Nathalie + Lola - 3 generations of Rykiel women, creating clothes for women by women. Nathalie is celebrating the birth of her first book, " Tu Seras Une Femme, Ma Fille " I draw Lola Rykiel and this is Max , the bear she gave me... Max will only drink chocolat chaud at cafe Le Select . He is quite particular like any French bear. Please visit Max at the new Sonia Blog . BONJOUR SONIA RYKIEL SAINT-GERMAIN! et merci!!!

When I left the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit at the Petit Palais on Friday morning, this was the line waiting. Get your ticket at FNAC please . I walzed in with no hindrance. Assuming you're planning to be in Paris... This bow affair is one of YSL's early works at his first coutourier, Dior. Red lips on black velvet and a definite charmer... YSL's use of and influence by artworks is evident throughout the exhibit - Here Mondrian and Matisse ... The strong exotique influence of the Near East and Morocco, his home away from Paris is another strong theme... Some Braque-influenced gowns... There's almost too much to take in here- YSL was such an innovator and constantly referencing all sorts of sources... There's a room of just fabric swatches - YSL was a great colorist. Pink was his favorite color. There are 15 rooms to view and near the end this grand collection of brilliantly colored evening gowns. In the same room - it's worth getting the audio tape, though it could take a week to get through it.. The back wall of this large room is painted black and completely covered with YSL's "Le Smoking" suits . The pencil sketches always catch my eyes - here The Trench. Plus I love the antics of his cartoon character, Lulu... Word out is that YSL could be quite cranky and unreasonable at times. Perhaps too much drink, drugs can be held accountable... There's a new book out on this aspect of his personality, Mauvais Garcon /Naughty Boy. Yet this picture in a book at Galerie Laffayette of YSL with all of his French Bull Terriers won me over completely - he is so obviously gaga over his doggies. Who do you think is the boss in this relationship? Over the years, he owned an endless string of French Bulldogs, each Brindle pied, each with the same name, Moujik . Upon the death of each dog, he’d immediately acquire another, and name it Moujik. What can one say? BONJOUR YSL! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com.

French Girl mysteriously writes me in New York: Dear Macaron girl, Oh by the way, when you are here, we will do the American way (??): you do as if you were at your home, you open the fridge, put tons of macarons, cook in the kitchen, use everything you want.......so funny!!!! When American girl arrives Sunday, French girl announces friends are coming at noon for lunch in Chinatown. 12:06: American girl, who is rather hungry from long plane trip says, where are your friends? 1:06: American girl says, Ahem...do you think we should call your friends? 1:30: American girl is pacing the room, thinking of looking in the fridge.. At 2ish friends arrive - This is The French way I'm informed. American girl is leaving for fancy French fashion show... French girl politely asks: are you taking that bag with you? The American Way: You are not leaving the house with that horrible thing . French Girl has a snack of chips. She eats TWO chips, with a naughty smile and puts the bag away. The American way: devour the entire bag at one go. French Girl's petit dej' in the morning- two slices of toast heavily slathered with butter and some tea. How French Girl can fit into this complicated, witty skirt, that only a French girl could wear, is beyond me? First thing in the morning (5am) I am at the computer, headphones on, working on my PB post, humming merrily away to Whatchasay . French Girl is suddenly standing in the doorway in her PJs. Your singing is waking me up! Eeep. French Girl does her blog posts in the evening like any sane person bien sur . French Girl is off to Carnaval in Limoux Thursday night, so she warns, French people sleep in on the weekends. No loud singing svp On Thursday evening I go to my macaron class at the Ritz . I see deux mecs /2 guys standing outside in chefs jackets yacking away in English. I ask them, How do I find the class? They respond The French way , Bonjour, bonjour , and then lead me down into the inner sactum of the Ritz. At reception two French women look at my facture and remark/giggle, but your class is next week! Eeep...I did not read the fine print :( I remember author Elizabeth Bard... Is doing a reading/book signing of Lunch in Paris at W .H.Smith just up the street on rue Cambon and run to catch it. Elizabeth has the most delightful and endearing way of recounting her experiences of The French Way - she met a French guy in Paris and married him. Elizabeth's French mother-in-law is eternally thin and never snacks between meals. At the beach she only brings a liter of water. Ce Ça! Elizabeth describes her French husband at breakfast- he leisurely makes his coffee, sits down, reads his paper perhaps, surrounded by chaos, yet ignoring it - definitely The French way . Do stop by Elizabeth's blog - I know you'll enjoy it as well as her book . Wednesday night, French Girl says, OK I am going away tomorrow. So tonight we eat The French way . After, you can do what you want . She takes away my soup pot, puts the computer on a chair, lays down a fine linen tablecloth and silverware. My soup is served in a proper bowl. Then she sits down and joins me for dinner The French way and heaves a great sigh of relief. French Girl's parting words as she takes off for the Limoux carnival, Don't burn down the house . This is a universal sentiment... So whatchasay? Have you experienced The French Way ? :) BONJOUR THE FRENCH WAY! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com.

Note the visiting fashionistas in Galignani have the latest edition... Entre! There are many levels rather than floors inside LV - it seems like you can go on forever. Note the classic Vuitton suitcases hanging on the walls... Even a fashion bookshop! All of the interior design is sleek and elegant... Hatless chic Parisiens browse. I am now hatless too by the way... Marc Jacobs designs accessories, everything for LV since 1997 and is completely adored by Parisiens . Some Americans are loved in Paris...go figure The BIG shoes here are covered with black roses... A red shiny trench has toil de Jouy cuffs and lining! How clever you are Marc. This looks to me like a very chic maids uniform non ? A boudoir maids outfit..? A mini bag even we may be able to afford. I forget the prix ... If you are a VIP at LV, waiting for your girlfriend to finish in the dressing rooms, they serve you an elegant demi-tasse of espresso. If you are me you go ( finally ) up the street to McDo's cafe to try the macarons. I gotta admit these are not bad, except for the caramel . And at McDo's you can hand them a 50 euro note for 6 euro bill and no one raises a fuss. A BIG plus in Paris. BONJOUR LOUIS VUITON!

It's the place to find the latest books on art and fashion... Right now the windows are full of YSL ... Yves Saint Laurent's first major retrospective opens tomorrow at the Petit Palais . I got my ticket at FNAC for Friday morning. Yay Inside Galignani the fashionistas are browsing, since the shows are still on... I spot Bill Cunningham from the NYTimes again ... They always have a slew of books on Coco . Remember when I wrote about The Gospel According to Chanel ? Wouldn't is be swell to have your book in a chic shop in Paris? More YSL mostly in French... A plethora of fashion books... No wonder Bill is here... This book caught my eye, My Mother's Clothes by photographer Jeanette Montgomery Barron... A lovely memoir/scrapbook of her late mother's various stylish outfits and the stories they recall. Poignant. A key thing to remember about Librairie Galignani is... It's exactly nextdoor to Angelina at 224 rue de Rivoli. So easy to pop in for a chocolat chaud post-browsing non ? BON APPETITE!

It's one of my observations that Parisien women don't wear hats no matter how frigid the weather (Feels like: 16°F) Warm puffy coat, snazzy studded bag... Cosy furry boots... But hatless... Giant posters of Kate Moss with supremely messy bedhead, advertising her new bag line for Longchamps is not helping the situation at all. Even my pictures have a blue cast, it's that freezing cold... Big puffy coat up over the ears - hair sticking out exposed to the elements. Lots of exposed ponytails in Paris... Another...here both mother and child are hatless. Men too. Me, I am wearing a hat. It's glued to my head. I'm American so I can get away with murder... Meanwhile the shop windows are full of hats like these big blue cabbage roses on top of the manequins... At Sonia Rykiel's - a simple Kelley green plastic disk is popped on top... More delicious disks at Gerard Mulot - tarte citron and tarte l'orange . Why not add a touch of red to your bedhead? Or go for the Carmen Miranda effect - totally fruity. BONJOUR HATLESS PARISIENS! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com.

It says 21 degrees/feels like 18. It should say feels like minus 18 . The Seine wind chill blows right through you. The fashionistas couldn't give a %$#@ Bonjour Bonjour Style reporter man-on-the street and all-in-blue, Bill Cunningham from the Sunday Times is dressed appropriately. We both scurry to grab a pic of barely dressed all-in-blue Lilly Allen Inside I squeeze onto the Photog's podium. I have no actual ticket or seat # but I'd rather stand here than sit in the gigantic stadium of the Halle Freyssinet ... The first model prances down the catwalk. A giant pompom on her head... I love this intarsia sweater with swallows flying... Fab flaming red long trench... Sonia's stripes - a must! Sky-high shoes with fur - a must! Fluid, drapie..what can you say? Tres feminine as always is Sonia . The grand finale of high-fiving smiling girls - so Sonia ... I follow these Sonia lovers into the mist at the end of the catwalk, thinking they are headed for the exit... Party time back stage... And another chance to admire while drinking champers... The model's look sheets... Makeup look photos for at least 60 girls... Back to realite and the next show... What it take to get "the Look" What it takes to get me back to feeling warm again - a cup of chocolat chaud at the cafe Deux Magots . Hope you had fun! Watch the show rehearsal!!

Paris Breakfast got an invite to attend Sonia Rykiel's show this Sunday . We were planing to depart next Sunday...ahem There's been some very crazy scurrying around here... We (my camera and I) took this picture of Sonia's St. Germain vitrine last October... Are these shoes not to die for? Would that we had these to wear Sunday's show? Choices, choices... Granted we will not be wearing Tavi 's hat from the Dior show. We won't be in the front row either :) Big merci Sonia ! So kind of you to let me come.
