The dune itself is the tallest in the UAE at over 300 meters, and the grade of the hill is roughly 50 degrees. Sharp, huh?The turbocharged engines themselves costs $90,000 USD and up, and some drivers watch that $90,000 go up in flames. Going...Going...Gone!The driver in the shot above slowly reversed down the dune, and got out unscathed. This driver was not so lucky.He rolled forward a couple of times up the hill, and then, after watching the video on youtube, he rolled what looked to be about 18+ complete turns down to the bottom of the hill.Through the grapevine we are told that the driver did not survive. If any readers can provide additional information, that would be helpful.You can read more about the Liwa Festival and the Mureeb Challenge in this article by The National. As mentioned in a previous post, it does rain in the desert. November-February tend to be the wetter months, but random storms are known to occur outside of the 'winter' months. I snapped these shots several weeks ago (using my mobile camera) when the UAE was hit with a series of rainstorms that our storm sewers simply couldn't accommodate. I was on my way home from work, and couldn't believe the amount of standing water.Later that same evening, there was so much water in the Khalidiya part of town that parked sedans were victims of the 'wake' caused by moving traffic. Many of them had water splashing midway up the door.My students reacted to the rain much the way kids in the U.S. respond to snow. They were happy to dance around and enjoy it while it lasted
