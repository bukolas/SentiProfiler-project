I'm having a rare asthma flare up today. The reason is because I hired someone to make a new bedroom in the basement for my son, and all the sawdust, and dust mites being spewed up through the vents is killing me. Well, it probably doesn't help that I've been cleaning the upstairs bedrooms, but that's done now. Keep in mind I'm not as bad as I would be if I weren't on all these great new controller meds, although I can definitely notice my early warning signs: 1. Tight chest 2. Itching feeling in neck area 3. exhaustion 4. Urge to sneeze 5. Nasal congestion 6. Runny nose 7. gut feeling 8. Ventolin isn't working 9. Can smell all the allergins in the air (a unique skill I have. More on this later) Now, I've been meaning to talk about this for a while, but my asthma is unique in that no matter how I feel my peak flows do not change. For example, I just blew into my peak flow meter, and my PEFR was 690. Keep in mind my personal best is 730, so 690 puts me right in my normal range.
