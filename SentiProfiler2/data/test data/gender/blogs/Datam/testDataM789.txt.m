I've only ever really had like maybe 7 people actually read my story and talk to me about it or mention something about it. Other then that. Everyone else I gave my story too never once even mentioned it. The two girls I worked with back in college always read my stuff and walk talk to me about the chapter. My one writing buddy. He and I used to exchange stories all the time and help each other out. My ex back in college. She actually would sit there and read my story next to me and then talk a little about it.
