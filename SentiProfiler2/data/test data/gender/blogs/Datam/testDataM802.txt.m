To cut a really long and winding short story, I was discussing the celebrated and illustrious Indian Premier League and the chances of Delhi Daredevils against Mumbai Indians in the match that was going to be held that day only in saddi Delhi. My dear friend refused to budge from the fact that DD was much better than MI. The discussion finally ended (after he and I had divulged all the strengths of our respective teams) with me and him betting on our preferent teams.
