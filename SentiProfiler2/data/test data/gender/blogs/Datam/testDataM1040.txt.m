You know life is life you can’t really chose where it takes you, god has a reason for everything that is the way I look at it. Sure you going to lose those you think you love and those you do, but if it wasn’t meant to be, there is nothing you can do but love, live and go on about your life. Sometime you get to the point when you have to just stop and think about all the positive things that have happened to you and stop thinking about the things in your life that you have fucked up, or things that have happened to you. My life has taken many many turn's some for the good some for the bad, but I am who I am from my past. I have many people that have been there for me throw everything and some that are just there to support me when I need someone to talk to, I am very thankful for those people and you know who you are. But I have to thank my dad for most of it, we have had are times like may may kids but he has never giving up on me even sometimes when he wanted to just drop kick me in the ass for some of the stupid shit I have done, but if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be the man I am today, if you know who i am u would know that I would do just about anything for those I care about. Some people abuse that to there advantage, but that’s there own fault. I want to thank everyone that has been there for me throw these ruff times and would do anything for you. But i am going to just say if your no longer in my life there is a reason why and you can just fuckin get over it!
