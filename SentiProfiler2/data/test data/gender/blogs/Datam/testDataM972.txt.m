for all you girls out there who say the men are the worst part of your relationships, that men are dogs.... screw you too.  i'm living proof that no matter how nice or how mean you are to a woman they will always find a way to make you feel like a second rate citizen.  The women in today's society are the real problem, they're only out to satisfy their vagina and they've had people like Oprah, Ellen, Rosie and a host of other single name powerful females tell them it's okay to do so.  It seems that as soon as a man cheats on a woman he's an asshole, but if a woman cheats on a man she's Liberated and Free.    Fuck That.

 if i cheat on a woman it's because the current one i've got is useless in the sack.  If i cheat on her, she's not staying around much longer.  IF a woman cheats on me, it's because i'm an emotional brick and wont talk to her, she'll keep that going as long as she can, get the emotional connect from some tiny dicked tad pole and come home to get fucked silly. Women of this generation are too empowered, or so they think, and they have no idea what to do with all this perceived power.
