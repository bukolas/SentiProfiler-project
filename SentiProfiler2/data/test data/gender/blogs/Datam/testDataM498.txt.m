Please also take note that I don't mean to offend anyone but merely to share my experiences (good and bad) - so please don't get all worked up by my entries - although constructive criticism is of course very welcome indeed! Having said that, I am not aiming to write a politically correct blog here. My writing is (naturally) highly subjective and expresses my (sometimes strong) opinions. Also, if you happen to be an American lawyer reading my entries: I take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever if someone chooses to somehow act based on any information in my blog.
