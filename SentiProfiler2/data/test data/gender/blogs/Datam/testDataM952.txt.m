In my job, I get to take most of the winter off.  In Austin, that means perhaps two months when nothing is growing or falling.  Now it's spring and I am having a hard time getting back into it.  I don't want to work anymore.  I want to do what I love instead.
What is work anyway?  To me it's doing something for money you wouldn't otherwise be doing.  I don't believe in that either, Alex.  I think everyone should be paid to do what they most love doing.  You can't buy enthusiasm.

So I am looking to make a change.  I talked to a good friend who said the first thing I should do is print up business cards with just my name and contact information, but without saying what it is I do.

Like, "Robert Adams.  I don't believe in work."
Well maybe not, even if it worked for Alex.
