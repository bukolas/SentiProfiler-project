I didn't really have a good title to my post, so I decided to massacre the title of one of my favorite Star Wars books.
As you may have noticed, it has been more than a month since my last post. I had some intentions of updating my blog shortly after I returned from school, but I have not gotten around to it until today. The last month of school did indeed go well. I gave all my reports and took all my tests. I got pretty good grades on the stuff that I did and now I am glad that I have to do no more of said assignments until the end of August. 
This past month I have been reading and playing video games. Pretty good summer so far. I know, in your mind you are saying, "What, this bum hasn't yet gotten a job?" To that I say, "I'm too pretty to work!" Well, actually, as y'all might have noticed, the job market is not extremely good right now. There is very little work in Pahrump, and even were a position to open up, it's tough because I know that there are a number of guys and gals in the church who need jobs to support families. If anything opens up, I'll probably let you know, but until then, it's helping out in the new building at the church and reading books.
