i feel rly bad, i started a rumor sayin this girl in my class hkd up with this guy on the bkb team..it got back to him and he has a gf and they r both freaking out
This girl who tries super hard to be popular posted these skanky pics on facebook so we all texted her anonymously telling her she's ugly.
somebody created a fake page with me on it asking ppl to vote if i was a loser
I gave my old gf my password a long time ago but then we broke up...and she goes into my FB & started telling all my girl friends i have stds, ****?!
Someone made an AIM account and posed as me. They were telling everyone I was a lesbian! People were harassing me at school and they all wanted to know if I really was a lesbian. 
My bf keeps asking where i am, what i am doing and who i am with!! He wont let me hang out with any guys even if it is for a school project and when i dont answer he tries to track me by facebook and and by my friends. Is that obsesive?????!!!!!!
My boyfriend texts other girls all the time and they send pics back and forth mostly naked. He says that he wants to be with me & they mean nothing but I can't help wanting to block their numbers from his phone. Did he cross the line?
"I asked an ex-boyfriend to stop posting ridiculous things on my facebook wall. He texted me and started calling me a ""stupid ******."" We broke up because he couldn't communicate. This just proved it further. "
ive been w/ my bf 4 8 months & its great but hes just really jealous.if some1 looks at me he gets mad. he dsnt want me hugging other guys even if theyre a friends.i cudnt go2 a party bc a guy invited me.it wsnt like id be alone but he still sed no
My ex keeps texting my brother and friends obsessively, they don't reply. He made his profile photo an embarrasing one of my friend, and then made it an embarrassing one of my brother. Then he put condoms all over my car in the middle of the night...
Two guys at our school have been with almost every girl they can get their slimy paws on. They've convinced these poor girls to send them nude pictures. I then found out about a website they had where they posted the pictures sent the link to friends
So what about these truth boxes on myspace? They allow people to say anonymous stuff about you. And i have to say i have gotten very mean things, that have lowered myselfestem and made me feel just plain awful. I think that ones over the line right?
i sent naked pictures to people i didnt know. im scared that someone will find out its me.. 
me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years, we have a child together he just got a cell phone, when i asked him if i could use his phone he instantly got defensive. since then hes been acting real shady, i find out hes been seein other chicas
A girl spreaded dirty rumors about me recently. She started to ''drag'' my friends away from me and tell everybody that I cut and do drugs after school. Now everyone makes fun of me and no one wants to be with me.
I had sent a photo last year to a guy I really like then he sent it too the whole school and I remember all the everyone had called me a***and I lost friends. Even close ones regret it now and wish it never happened at all!! 
I have a gf who is constantly tlking to her ex's and guys friends.  I have no problem with this except for the fact tht she said they are trying to hook up with her. They txt me saying they r gonna****** her and stuff but she continues to tlk to them.
"I found the pass to my gf's myyearbook and i suspected her of trying to hook up with other guys, and i found messages on her chatter saying "" talking to the most aamzing guy hehe travis"", and ""travy baby u make me feel amazing.""  idk what to do."
my boyfriend has been texting his ex more than me, calling her more than me, and recieving nude pics from her cuase i wont send them to him
so i have been in a relationship with a guy for 7 months and he swears he never cheated.yet i caught him lying bout hangin with his friends & really he was with a girl at the movies.he told me she is taken but they still text more us.can i trust him?
My current boyfriend is extremly Jealous. He made me delete my Myspace & all the guys on my Facebook. He is constantly asking me who i'm texting & talking too, and trying to go through my phone. He wont leave me alone. Is he crossing the line?
my bf of 3 1/2 yrs constantly texts females all day wether its on his phone or online, he lies about who he talks to and doesnt care about my feelings. He even put a lock on his phone ever since i seen tht he was sending penis pics to other females
am hooked on both facebook and msn messenger i can not stop checking them constantly , I need to be on the phone 25/7 and this has cost me my last relationship , what to do?
Me and my ex-boyfriend broke up more then a month ago and We did some intimate things at our friends house. And Now i get some messages on formspring about what we did and calling me a ****** for it. I dont what to do if it gets more talkative..
My 2 year relationship ended recently, he blames it on FB & guy friends I've had since I was little. He hacked my account, went through my phone, & had my friends tell him where I'm at. He questions me nonstop & I'm literary sick of it. I'm confused.
m boyfriend is always out partying and im always hearing how he brings other girls over his house and tells me he dosent but then he tells me not to go anywhere and i always listen to him  because i really like him.what should i do?
my boyfriend text another girl how much he likes her, misses her, and cant wait to share a room with her at the beach for a week. to top it off im not invited on the beach trip when everyone else is because she doesnt like me. how amazing is that? 
I sent a picture too a boy i really liked. He asked for it and I was hoping maybe he would like me if I sent it too him. By the tiime I got too school the next day everyone was looking at me and laughing. He sent it to the whole school. Even my dad!
my bf & my baby's dad always gets mad if he dsnt have my passwords, plus, he dsnt even want me 2 have a cell, but he dsnt give me his passwords& gets mad if i even pick up his phone i know he cares cuz hes cried for me 2 stay wit him,wat should i do?
Relationship was good until I started to see a lot of comments from girls on his FB about how they miss him or can't wait to meet. I went into his email and seen nude pics & flirty emails. I confronted him & he says I'm insecure and it's not cheating
i broke up with my new boy friend a few months ago, and then was planning on getting back together with my ex-boyfriond and then he gets all ***** at me and sends this nude photo of me. was he wrong for that?
My current boyfriend always looks @ my facebook to see if I am flirting with anyone! He even looks @ my status' to see if its 'appropriate'!! If he feels like something is wrong with my FB he does not talk to me! he is afraid I may cheat on him ugh!
the boy i liked asked me for a nude and i sent it when he pointed out a flaw i sent a new one, he ended up w/ 3 pics,his best friends all started talking to me bc he showed them, on my bday he asked fer a video when i said no he quit talking to me. 
My bf is insane. I met him  2 years ago and had sex with him after only knowing him for a week. We now have a kid together.. hes 16 months. my bf is so controlling.. when i leave the house, he has to know where im at at all times and i have a curfew!
so im 21 and im with a 20 year old guy. he constantly texts me and tells me that i cant do somethings. i went out with my friend and he said i can only have one drink. safe to say i had more than one but its like ***.
I ended things with my girlfriend because of issues with distance. So, she grabs her phone and facebook, and tells five of our best friends (we shared a lot of the same friends) what a jerk I am. They havn't talked to me since.
"I loged on one day and saw where one of my ""friends"" made a post saying a gril has chlamydia! I thought it was a bit harsh."
My boyfriends ex wife used thier daughters FB page to trash me, her sisters to even . Saying I had a lack of social and parenting skills ( i'd put my kid up against hers anyday and win) even went so far as to call my daughter and mother nasty things!
my ex gf accussed me of doing drugs, being gay and stingy - announing her point of view public on my facebook wall... what would you do? Delete the message and let it go... Or Spam Her Website!!!!?
a colleague stabbed me from behind@work and stole a big project. i still have to do the project but he got the credit. he's not stopping there,he talked to ppl in my back about me resulted i lost several incentives. i want2make him pay what he did.

I guy I was previously involved with started acting strangely with me- come to find out, he'd been posting about us every step of the way, and was mindlessly acting out everything his online pals told him to do, even when it didn't mesh with reality!
i thought i loved my boyfriend and i stripped for him on skype while on vacation, but i was wrong we had a messy break up, i moved on, he didn't. He wanted to seek revenege and sent in pictures of me to my sorority and got me kicked out.

my BF seemed nice and romantic whenwe first started. after a couple of months i noticed he was checking in on me alot. he went through my phone bill to see who i was calling and he didnt trust me so he followed me everywhere even in the bathroom.
so my boyfriend tells me to update him with everything i do..not go on facebook if he's not on and i cant go out unless its with him and all of our friends. he tells me he's only trying to protect me
My best friend of 9 years told me that she wants to end our friendship 2 months ago. She said that she hates who ive become and that shes been pretending to be my friend. But now she still talks to me and i dont know what to think of this.

My boyfriend constently calls me. Asking me where i am all the time. For example i was sleeping and home and he called me 80 times and because i didn't answer he thought i was cheating on him. He also went through my phone and deleted all boy #'s.
My bestfriend and I had a fall out months ago. I felt like if I wasn't doing something FOR her, she wasn't interested in me. We recently began talking again, and she's right back to asking me to do things for her. I miss her, but is it too much?
My (now ex) Boyfriend would have his friends text me to see if i would sext them, when i asked him to make them stop he just told me i should go ahead and do it. Even though i didnt even sext HIM! Then he would accuse me of being sluty.
"when my boyfriend and i were dating, he'd tell me he was cheating on me and that he didn't love me. when i told him i couldn't take it anymore he'd tell me that he was ""just joking"" and that wasn't being serious. i was heartbroken each time."
well i have a friend who is black and is racist toward her own race or at least pretends to be..the deal is that i use to act like that because i really wanted he to like me i even talked alot of $%!* about a girl who use 2 be a very good friend 2 me
everytime me and my boyfriend hang out i ALWAYS go through his phone to read his texts, even when hes sleeping or in the shower or something. but we've been together for 3 years now so is it wrong that i still dont trust him?
So I was dating this guy for over two years,when one day a reliable source tells me he has been messing with other girls. I broke up with him. Two days later we got back together, but i found his phone and apparently he asked a girl out the day after
so i dated a guy for not very long & he was nice for the first few months, then he got really really controllling, to the point where if i was hanging out with my grandparents he would get super **** & break up with me.
I really liked this guy from Myspace. He was really nice and everything. Then he asked for a picture, I said no but he begged and made me feel bad. So I did it. We went out for 3 weeks then I found out he does the same thing to every girl.
I have been with mike for 3 years.. We have a new baby.. and ever since She was born.. he accuses me of cheating on him.. and i swear i am not.. e doesnt understand its not okay to say these things.
Two women  sent me a FB message about my x fiance and he was txtin  a woman in another state.  I should have slap him in face and he did a *** move and broke up with me VIA Facebook
i have an older bf that was more experienced when we got together.he comments girls pictures and flirts but thinks its ok bc he says he only wants me and that i complain to much.then he will stop and ill find them again.should i complain or be ok?
i used to cheat on my bf, but now i have a baby with him. i love having this family but he said he can't trust me and he doesn't like feeling and acting controling or jealous. i feel like i alway need to know where he is and what he's doing. 
This friend of mine always always talks about people and trashes then through text. Then when someone confrounts her she acts like she never sais it
"freshman in high school an this boy i thought was cute asked for my number and we started talking, he asked me to send a picture, at first i was like ""never"" but then he convinced me and i did it, couple days after the whole football team has seen it"
My bf  and have call my says do you want  phone sex and no ok but then next day i him call and i ask him if want to have phone sex he tells yes then he tells me 2 take off my shirt okand i did told me 2 take pic when i had notthing on i did an i send

Theres this guy i talk to but he has aGF.He keeps saying he'll break up with her but i went on  facebook and saw a pic of them together.he keeps trying to have sex with me and i like him but i dont  dont wanna have sex and i dont wanna be the OTHER 1
My boyfriend keeps touching me on my leg, inner theigh, and even a little closer. I keep telling him too stop, but he doesn't.  He says I'm smiling, which I'm not, and so that it's okay that he does it. Over the line?
"My dad committed suicide in 2007, and recently i wrote about how much i loved/missed him on myspace. People sent me messages saying it was my fault, and i deserved it, and they said ""if i were your dad i would have killed myself too"" over the line?"
"Soo.. I was sexxaging someone on fbook, and I'm in a comitted relationship.  We exchanged private pics. I changed my mind at the last minute about cheating..and they got mad at me and posted my ""sexual organ"" as their profile pic.... hmm"
So, i was dating a guy for two years and i beilieve i was in love. Wat a fool i was. i decided 2 have sex with him on my birthday unfortunately everyone in his school saw my birthday suit. see while having sex he hid a camera video taping everything.
me and my boyfriend got back together and this girl that he was tlking to wen we broke up text him all the time after ive asked her to stop she does it with every ones boysfriends is she over the line?
This guy gave my best friend, who's also a guy, the password to his email. That's the eamil he uses when girls send him pictures or videos of themselves naked. He also shares that same email with another guy. So all those girls pictures get seen.
me and my boyfriend were only together for 4 months,but i knew i loved him,im not sure wut happened and we just broke u. and at the time i met a new guyfrind and my bf looked thru my texts and after we broke up, he told everyone that i cheated on him
alright, so me and this guy dated fell in love blah blah blah, i got pregnant and he left. i lost my son *** by all of the stress but he calls me a ***** and i should burn in hell .. funny thing, i still am in love with the idiot. what should i do
I cheated on my gf, 3 times in 3 yrs...Am I guilty of not telling her the truth?
k so my guy friend posted his cell on myspace and i wanted to txt him anonymously as a joke. he started sexting and me and my friend sexted back as a joke. later i told him it was me. he then told evry1 i wanted 2 have sex w/ him. now evry1 mocks me!
my boyfriend goes though my phone everytime we're together and if i have any text from any boys, or any calls, even if there are any boys in my adress book then he gets mad. He's cheated on me and he's been texting other girls, no remorse, over?:(
whenever my boyfriend and i are together he goes through all my texts. but he never lets me go through his.
my boyfriend was sitting by me then hugged me and grabed my phone with out me knowing and went threw all my txts :(
Me and my boyfriend have been goin out for almost 3 years now and he still, till this day, goes through my phone. He tries to be sneaky but I ketch him everytime. I hate that I dont have my own privacy and that he doesnt trust me. I dunno what to do.
"Well. I had one of those Formsprings couple of months ago. Next thing I know I'm gettin' all these things from this person sayin' I was ""fat"" and needed to get a life. And that I was a ***. All this stuff. It was pointless. It was over the line."
ive only been dating my current boyfriend for a month. he's grounded, and im stuck needing something exciting. tonight my ex wants to meet up, and he says whatever happens, happens. do i go hang out with him? or stay with my boyfriend.
when i met my boyriend, him and his ex were sending messages to each other all the time, and i always felt bad because she is perfect, and after a year of going out, he told me that he still loves her, but wants to be with me. what do i do?
I have been dating this guy for 6 months. We have a thought that its time to go to the next level.And by next level, i mean SEX!. But i dont know if its the right thing to do. My friends are saying that he is just pressuring me.HELP.I REALLY NEED IT.

My boyfriend and I have been going through alot of problems. His bestfriend asked for sexts, I was feeling down so I sent him some, now they're all over school. Plus I keep getting all of these phone calls asking me to 'hook up' with all these guys.
 My best friend is 13. And she is going out with a boy who is 12. she and him are gonna have sex. soon I told her she might regret it but she still wants too. she is afraid people are gonna call her a ***. What should she do?

I've had a boyfriend for about a year.. but i met this other kid and i txt him all the time without my boyfriend knowing. We dirty talk to each other but thats about it. Should i stop or continue?
My ex-boyfriend wanted a naked  picture of me, and I said no, and he was so mad. So about 3 week's later he dumpedme, and he like's one of my friends JUST FOR HER LOOK'S. And I still love him, alott. and it hurt's.
The guy I like went through my phone thinking I was doing something behind his back, and to make it look like i did something wrong while i was sleeping he made a convercation up with this guy in my phone & made it sexual and then asked me *** it was
My boyfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years. But he still has jealousy issues, I went to a friends house last week to hang out and watch a movie. And he some how got it in his head that i was cheating. So he showed up and made me go home. 
I really like this guy for his personality but when we hung out and right before we had sex his ***** was small and he stepped back and said we cant do it. I got mad and left.
Today i had sex with my ex boyfriend. we recently broke up because he ignored me for a week. i feel like it was a horrible idea. we still love each other, but we shouldnt have done it. now hes not answering my texts. don't let people fool you, EVER.
The boy i was seeing  cheated on me in front of all my friends. That same day he invited me to come sleep over in the bed that they had sex in, and had sex with me. My entire group of friends knew for two days until he finally told me.  He was sober.
I liked this guy for over a year, we talked almost everyday and he was so sweet and charming. But when we finally hung out alone, all he did was try to get in my pants. But i can't help that i still like him, even tho hes a jerk. 
my fiance broke up with me for reasons that we could have worked out. he still kisses me but tells me there is no hope for us to get back together though i know he still loves me......should i let him keep doing this...or drop him?

My best friend has been dating a boy for 1 month and claims hes the one. shes already had sex with him alot. Yet she says if she got pregnant he would probably leave her. what a jerk. what am i supposed to say to this? I cant let her get hurt!

My friend always laughs at me when I am being serious, she thinks that it is soo funny when I am honestly hurt or something is concerning me. Do you think that I should break this friendship or just hold this in until I blow? 
So I know a guy, who knows a guy, who told me that his friend pressured his girlfriend to have sex with him.  Was this over the line?

My bf always hangs with his ex's and girls he cheats on me with, but when I get upset he calls me obsessive and breaks up with me. Then when he sees me talking to guys, he adds them on myspace and threatens them... if that were me he'd be pissed..

So, i was talking to this guy and i thouhght he was cool and stuff cause i know him for a long time. then all of the sudden he starts callin me a ***** and telling gus to stay away from me because i wouldn't give up the goods.
My boyfriend broke up with me and started going out with my bestfriend. Now he tells her that she can't be my friend anymore, or he'll break up with her& she's listening to him! I've known my best friend since we were 4&she only met him a month ago.
my boyfriend reads my texts whenever im out of the room, and gets mad at me for talking to any guys that arent him. but he still talks to his ex girlfriend and lies about being friends with her. and tells me im dumb whenever i get mad at him for it. 
"my mans ex texts him, he sats i can text back so i did but he got *****that i didnt say ""thank you"" at the end of the text so he threatened to kick me out."
*** g/f threatens 'to go *** someone else' or will say 'I'm not gonna wear any underwear and go to a bar and pick someone up' when we get into an argument. Has happened on numerous occassions .. should I worry? Drives me out of my mind when she says
"My boyfriend talks to his ex-girlfriend. His ""first"", but he claimed to be joking around when he told her that she'll always be his baby and if it doesn't work out between her and the other guy then she could come back to him. "

One of My closest friends sent nude pics to this guy and he ended up hacking his friends profile and posting her pics online.  the guy whos profile was hacked was hated for a long time, but eventually the pics were taken down.
"My ex girlfriend hacked my facebook account while I was deployed to Afghanistan.  She went through my sent messages and used a message to a fellow soldier's sister as a reason not to get back together with me.  It said ""Hey, what's up?""."
My somewhat boyfriend always goes threw my phone when we're together but he never lets me touch his phone. And when we're not together he's always bothering me about who I'm with, and I'm not allowed to talk to any other guys, but it's okay for him.
My guy always asks me where I am and who I'm with, if I even smile at another guy he yells at me. But he can talk to every girl he wants, even when I say something to him he makes up some excuse. I don't know what to do.
ive been with my bf for a yr&4 months. its ok for him to go thru my phone & everything but i cant touch his.he ask me where im at, who im with,who im tlkn to,'spyin' on me,call me names,make me feel bad. no matter how hard i try, i cant leave him.

Well, I dated this guy.. He would only want my body. He claimed to ' love me ' but he would ask for 'special pictures' from other girls. When I'd ask him about it he'd always deny it. But he asked my BEST FRIEND for them. 
"I lost my virginity to my love, (who i'm still with) and somehow word got around, and people started these nasty rumors about me being prego and aborting the baby, and ingraved ""slut"" on my locker. And me and my boyfriend are still together. ***?"

My girlfriend never wants to call or text me. We've been dating for well over a year now. But anytime im around her, shes texting her co-workers. She goes and has coffee with them in the morning, but anytime I ask her to go get breakfast she declines
"i sent some 'pics' to this guy i really like, we rnt dating and he promised not to show or tell anyone. so i told some of my friends and they confirmed it w. him;they all told the school. now everyone thinks im a slut. and wants me to give them some."
me and my two closest made a fake myspace and talked to various people. we made people fall in love and just soo we could bring them down. and all the while we were laughing about it. it wasn't right. i'm so sorry.
i have my ex's passwords to alllllll his accounts (aol, yahoo, FB, various dating sites)  i erase his inbox messages, i delete people off his friends lists and then he thinks he did something wrong and stresses over it. changed/deleted his profiles..
"with a fake yahoo account, ive sent emails to my ex making him believe that one of his ""girl"" friends was talking shit behind his back. it worked for a while, he was stressing and thats wat i wanted! we're still very close so im not sorry i did it!"
I been messing with a guy whos 4yearsolder then me on & off for about 3years i had sex w. him and told him i was pregnat so he could pay more attention 2 me i feel bad but the only way he PaysAttention 2 me is when i give him money or **** with him 
I sexted with this one guy I really like. He only seems to talk to me just for pictures and i say yes everytime because I really like him, and maybe if I do send them he will like me more. Should I just get over him, or just quit sending pictures??
"I met this guy on Meez.com n he gave me his num. So evr since December we hve been texting. So 1 day he text me n said ""Can you send me a pic"" so i did and then he said ""Nooo a naked one"" After that tex i ignored him. What should i do?"
"So I talk to this guy from my school, I like him a lot. we started ""talking"" in January, I send him pictures all the time, and he always says ""what he's going to do to me"" but in school he makes no contact with me. I just feel like he's using me"
my sisters boyfriend treats my sister like crap and always puts her down  it makes me mad but when i do something he just calls me fat. is he ove the line.
one time i sent a guy a naked picture of me and im a dude and he showed all of my friends and they didnt know i was gay so i was like thats why you have a ****
i really like this guy and i had sex with him and i send him a picture and he still doesnt want to date me. i develped alot of feelings for him what do i do?
Ok, so i have been dating this guy on and off for a year now. we've both cheated but i'm not allowed to have friends myspace ect. but he's allowed to do whatever he wants i just want this realationship to be fair =[ what do i do?
a boy from my school keeps asking for send him nude pics andwhen i say no he will say something like i love you :) please for me?when we first started talking he told me not to mention what he was saying to anyone? How can i just be friends with him?
i had sex with my bestfriends brother but he was also my other bestfriends boyfriend.they both hate me now...his gf is now the mother of his baby.but she wasnt pregnant till after i hooked up with him..but now she hates me...
I sent a picture of me nude to a boy from school, and it got around to everyone in the 9th grade, even 12th. Now, he's all trying to be friends with me and trying to get me to have sex with him, what do I do??

"I've been dating my bf for 1.5 yrs  but he still thinks I'm cheating. I go out of my way& do things to make him feel more comfortable,but it never helps. He went on my online cell phone bill ""online"" and changed my password then lied to me about it. "

would you sleep with a girl that is in a commited relationship with anyother guy. She wants me and I want her and the other day she told me she had herpes but her partner doesnt. Would you still sleep with her with a condom?
ok me n this guy are going out but i fell for this other guy but i still love my bf and i kissed this other guy and i like him a lil more than my bf shud i stay with my bf or go with the other guy?
bf is so desperate for some pics of me ...naked and i feel so used. he and his friends are calling me a **** and other demeaning names and idk if i should give in and send pics so the name the name calling would stop but idk what i need to do 
my boyfriend sent pics of his man parts to two other girls and we were together for 8 months the first time and then he did it again the month after and he sayd its not cheating....i do love him but i dnt kno what to do about it
ive been with my boyfriend for almost 11 months and he goes through my phone and my myspace and facebook and he wont let me hang with my old friends or tlk to guys and always says im cheating,i live with him and am home all day what shld i do??

"My Bf tells me that he loves me and that he wants to marry me but he expects me to be ok with being his wife someday and his ""fake sister"" whom he's had sex with before to be his girl on the side...all because I told him I was into girls keyword WAS"
I was tlking to one of my exs, and he had a gf. But he wuld always ask me to send nude photos of myself, and id always say no, and he wuld threaten me saying id bettr change and he wuld get the photos one way or another, we dnt tlk anymore though. 
"my ex tells me he loves me, and we still fool around, and im his ""best friend"". we thought wed get back together, but now he doesnt want to, and i just found out im pregnant, but he says theres still no way hed take me back."
I was in the middle of a bad breakup with my most recent ex,and his friends jumped in online and called me all kinds of names,ignoring me in public. I was really upset that they only seemed to have a backbone when they were behind a keyboard.
Ok so ive been with my boyfriend for about 2 years. In the last month he broke 4 of my brand new phones, just because he seen a guys number witch was just a friend. Yea hes pretty crazy n he got me the same way. 
"so i have a boyfriend weve been together for 3 years; i met his best friend a couple months back we hung out one time and we had sex in the back of his car ; we didnt use protection & now im pregnant my boyfriend doesnt know. wat do i do ? "

"My ex-husbands now girlfriend sent an email and asked all of her family and friends to ""pray"" for me saying that I was bitter and had negative energy for her, him and their kid. She forwarded an email sent to her by me in response to her call to me."
I want to say my mother in law uses God as an excuse to have a relationship with a married man who lives blocks away from her house. My husband and I live 10 minutes away from her and she won't agree to watch out son while we find a new babysitter..
my stepmom wrote this about me online. since then, i've gotten messages from older men: I had a step daughter named ----. Wow, the girl is psychotic... She was put on ****... Has been **** since she was 13 y.o.... [She] is the town bike.
I like to be friends with my husband's EX because I want to constantly throw her in his face and create drama and chaos. I accuse him of wanting her more than me and I even accused him  of sleeping with his Mom but I was pregnant so its OK to do
"I told my so called ""best friend"" that i had sex with this guy and i thought i could trust ,but I was wrong. Before i knew it everyone was talking about it.People i barely know been calling me,texting emailing me, and i wish it never happened..."
okay this guy who's 16 i knew for 3 years and had a crush on forever. well me and him always flirt and sometimes end up having sex.i have a boyfriend and he got a girlfriend but we dont care we just like having sex with eachother. is this wrong?
well the other day i sent a nude picture to my boyfriend  and of his friends took his and saw the picture and sent it to himself and showed it to other people and now people are gettin the wrong idea of me

He was a friend. I didnt really know him that well. I got to know him over facebook. Then he just started to ask for pictures of my body.... i didnt know what to do. I mean i didnt even know him and all of a sudden he was asking for pictures
my boyfriend & my bestfriend were hanging out i told them both not to do anything &when i talked to my bestfriend the next day the told me howthey made out &so on..
there was this boy talking to me about how much he like me nd i gave him my number nd invited him ovr tha nxt day afta skool nd we had sex he took my v-card now he isnt tlking to me how do i get ovr him.?
i have been unlove with a guy for 2years and he loves me too . . . but he had sex with his step sister when ii was with him . . . should i forqet about him and move on ? 
Me and my boyfriend have been togather for 3 years now and i still get treated like some random chick. i dont understand but girls are always calling the house and he is hardly ever home and we live together 
"My Boyfriend is constantly up my rear end ad when i ask him a simple question he gets mad and says ""thats not your position to ask im the man in this relationship"" i love him but i have to leave him"
I remember when I was still living in Germany, I had a boyfriend und I always treated him like he was everything to me, but one day he blew me off und started to treat me like I was garbage.The next day I saw him making out with random girls.
my friend has a boyfriend they have had sex couple of times  BUT everytime she comes around in skool he either ingones her or filrtes with another girls he went to far one day and had sex with this girl and had a baby she hasnt broken up with him yet
ive been w. this guy for almost 3 yrs...we are young but got 2 kids and we are engaged. but he has cheated on me mutiple time w. his x and he still wont let her go and keeps hurtin me w. her even tho shes states away...what shud i do now?
i have a bf but i've been flirting with a guy who likes me&i also kinda like him.i keep telling the other guy i'm going to break up with my bf but i really have no intention to. i'm only telling him this because i don't wanna see him with anyone else
i cheated on a guy. we broke up. now he is threatening me calling me fat, ****, thhat i should kill myself and he cheated on me. idk wht to do now to make him stop. i dont reply and ive blocked him.
I like texting dirty, I usually don't send photo's of myself but I have before even when I had a boyfriend I would dirty text multiple other guys. How do I stop doing this?
My first love means the world to me broke my heart multiple times, cheats sometimes, and even when we are dating and he has anotherr girlfriend he still tells me he loves me, ugh!! What do i do!? Keep hope, or let go.....
i was at our sk8ing rink and they were closing. i was walking around a dark corner with a 17 year old gettin ready to leave and he decides to take my hand and start makin out with me. im 4 yrs younger than him and something didnt feel right.
well im tired of feeling like my babyfather still cheats on me has done one to many times and for my son i try to keep it cool what should i do believe he's really gonna change or just go wit how my heart really feels?
MY boyfriend that i been with well over 2yrs admitted to cheating on me in our home turns out with a girl i see on a regular bases i love him and for gave alot but is this over the line? 
a guy on my college track team who is a bit older than me dosent want to date but we fool around and sext a lot, he dosent always treat me the greatest but i care about him and he just wants to play. wrong?
My boyfriend deletes all my other guy friend contacts in my phone. He gets really mad when I txt other guys even when there my friends.
I love my boyfriend very much but we dont really talk anymore and we never go on dates, like to dinner or movies anymore and if we do i usually pay and i feel like he doesnt put forth as much effort as i do. 
a guy from my college track team who is a bit older than i am, we have had sex a couple times but sext constantly, he dosent want to date and treats me bad at times but i care about him alot with heart. wong?
My boyfriend wants to try new things in the bedroom like have a 3sum but im not into girls. What should i do? Should I go thru with it or just tell him that im not comfortable with it. He says it would spark the relationship. Is this over the line?
I have serious trust issues and my bf told me his password to facebook right after we got together. I've been going on for months now and have even reset his password when he tries to change it. He's honest but I just can't make myself trust him.
so this guy i had sex with more then 20 he got a girl and i got a man. i like him a lot but something is wrong i think i might be pregnant with his kid not even boyfriend's but some other guy im so scared and i dont know wat to do.im all alone )'=
My bf snapped of racy pic of me on my cell phone and my brother saw the photo. He has been threatening to tell my Dad unless I hook him up with one of the friends.
"EX TOLD ME HE STILL LOVED ME AFTER HE GOT OVER DA DEATH OF HIS CUS.WE TRIED2GO BCK OUT BUT WERE ON&OFF W/JUST BING""2GETHER""CUS OF SUMTIN W/HIS PARENTS.HE ASKED ME OUT1NIGHT THEN SAID HE DIDNT MEAN2DA NEXT DAY.HES NOT DA SAME&I DNT TLK2HIM NOW.WRONG?"
I have been putting ads on Craigslist with my photo for anon sex but haven't gone thru with it yet. I really want to go for it one time. Boys and girls send me sexts from the ad and I really like it. My gf won't understand but I can't get caught.
i was looking at the pics on my gf of 6 years phone and saw a pic of her **** on a guy,i really love her and dont know what to do
there was this guy at my school that i really liked/loved. he had a gf but they cheated on each other all the time and i was so lonely. and i flashed him over videochat one night, for the first time in my life. he took a pic and sent it everywhere:(
Me and this one guy have been talking for 3 years now and he asked for pictures and i sent him a couple and he sent them to everyone in his phone 
So me and my boyfriend haven't been going out very long. But we argue a lot about little things. He doesn't trust me and i haven't given him a reason not to. He looks through my phone. He checks my page on myspace. And gets mad when i go out. advice?
My friends compete and how many boys they can hook up with. BFF up to 27 boys. They are really popular and everyone is into it. I am graduating soon so I dont care about my reputation, I want to join in. Can you get stuff from bjs?
So my bf and I of five months broke up ON OUR 5 months! But he did it in the most ass way ever! @ first he had his FREND tell me he wanted a break (space away) NOT  break up. He made that clear..and THEN i find out from my friend that weve ben broken up.
My best friend asked me to change her myspace password for her, because her net was down. When I logged on, I read her messages between her and the guy that I sent a crude video to. I felt and still feel absolutely horrible. Was I over the line?
My bestfriend took a nude pic of herself and sent it to her bf and 2 weeks later they broke up and he sent it to his facebook and myspace and she got aressted for child porn and she was 16.
alright. so this girl that seems pretty cool always wants to talk about sex over text. im a little bit uncomfortable with that. but what urged me to do this was when she said we could do it all when i come over. we've never met either. help?
"me and my ex talk now after we broke up 3 yrs ago he has a gf for 2 yrs and always calls me on friday night to ""chill"" he always says he wnts to fix our frndshp but then asks me to do stuff with him. after he dsnt talk to me much until nxt frdy"
my friend sent her bf a nude pic and shes only 12! they brokeup and he sent it to all his friends and she got suspended for sexting.
two months ago i was threatend over text message by a guy who i knew and trusted and he threatend me again in school over massage and thats when i had to tell the principle cause if I didn't only God know what would have happend. 
i like this guy but he always wants nude photos.. but i say no then he ignores me:/ i like him sooo much but he only wants one thing!
"My ""best friend"" alwaysss brags about what my ex-boy friend and her did or like talked about. And it reallly hurts my feelings cause she knows it makes me mad!"
i am madly in love with my ex but he HATES me, talks **** on me. i need advvice like what i should do?
My bf goes to school1000miles away&dnt get to see each other much He asks me to send pics of myslf i know he would never show them to anyone i just feel uncomfortable taking them Ive told him this he still gets mad when i tell him no hes wrong,right?
I used to have a long distance relationship. Every hour he would text me asking me what I was doing, who I was with& if I was having sex with any guys. It got to the point where I'd feel bad about going out. I don't know if we should break up or not?
me and my bf had sex for my birthday,we still have sex, now i am having sex with his brother and his two friends ,and i just found out my bf is cheating on me..so i am going to have sex with my bff hilary
recently, on a video chat website, i took off ALL of my clothes from a radom guy and he is now my friend on facebook and asked to chat again and i said i was unconfortable and he said okay, thanks anyways. you are beautful. is that cheating on my bf?

last year, i sent a naked picture to my boyfriend and forgot to delete it off my phone. the next day, people had taken my phone, found the picture, and sent it to there own phone. From there they sent i to everybody in school. :/
i went through my bfs cell phone and found some very dirty texts messages to another girl. he claims they were old text and that he wanted to keep them because they were important to him. i dont know if i should believe him.
My boyfriend and I have been in the most untrust relationships you could be in.  Everytime we see eachother he has to go thought my phone.  If he sees one text from any guy no matter what it was about,  he will say were done and not talk to me.  
Last year i sent a nude to a guy that i liked and it turns out his older brother had his phone .The next day i found out that he had sent it to almost all of his contacts.
My boyfriend cheated on me in the past and I took him back. But just recently about 3 weeks ago he cheated on me again, we broke up but got back together and I'm starting to realize this might be a dummy move. Crossing the line??
My brother took my phone and read through my text messages from my boyfriend while i was sleeping .
I have no guy friends numbers in my phone anymore. I can't talk to guys or hang with them . Crossing the line?
I dated a guy off and on in highschool and somewhat during college. I am currently in a relationship (of 4 years) and he's engaged. But he still texts and calls. And when I go into the restraunt he works at, he's very inappropriate. Any thoughts??
My girlfriend is constantly on her phone, texting all of her friends (mostly guys), some are past hook ups but they remained friends somehow. She says that I shouldn't get upset and that their just friends. She's cheated on me twice in 2 years. Over?
i dated a guy for 3 years, he cheated on me alot, hurt me, lied to me, &still does. he knows im not over him but continues to talk to every girl he can get his hands on. he still tries to get with me and talks to me alot..over the line? what do i do?
So , theres this guy I'm talking to, and he's always going by what he says when someone says I'm cheating on him(when honestly I'm not)he gets mad and tells me not to talk to him, we work things out, but when I ask bout him & other girls he gets mad?
my girlfriend went to go study abroad later i found out that she was making fun of me and telling her friends she hooked up with some one when i asked her about it she said she was lying to her friend cause she didnt have anything else to talk about

i was with this boy for 8 months nd i thought we were gonna be together threw out the year. we did something totally ******* and now hes calling me names in the hall way and im afraid of confronting him because he might say something. 
me&my boyfriend brokeup&he said if i sent him naked pictures he would maybe give me another chance.i sent them,because i liked him alot.his who school saw&all his friends texted me for nudes,and i just kept sending them out,now i'm known as a slut.
My boyfriend didnt trust me because i wasnt a virgin. He wouldnt let me go out with my friends cause he felt that i would cheat on him. So one night I ended up having sex with my Ex. I told him the next day. It only happened cuz he couldnt trust me:(
"im 13 ... i went out with this kid for a little bit after a year & we just started hooking up. thing is i dont like him & he doesnt like me. & weve gone really far in the MONTH that we've been ""friends w. benefits"". now he wants to do too much.."

"So I've had this friend for six years. Two weeks ago, she moved, & about two days ago, I got an email that said ""You are a ***** & I never want to talk to you again. The only reason I was friends with you was because I felt bad. ***."" Is it ovtl?"
i used to say really mean things about people online on there formsprings. but i didn't know them and it was super mean. and i feel bad. because i judged them harshally on soely there looks not their personalities..
8th grade i sent a picture of myself in my bra and panties to a guy.his phone was broken so i had 2 send it 2 his friends phone.he showed it to 5 of his friends and they sent it around. 2 years later and nobodies forgotten.nobody believes im a virgin
i was talking to this guy, and he asked me to send him nudes, and i did, and now everyone in my school has them, and people who go to the school my sister goes to has them, and people are starting to not like her because of me ):
my friend slept with my boyfriend. now she likes my new boyfriend and seh sent him a nude. so me and him sent it to the whole school.. even her mom, dad, stepmom and stepdad. she's known as a ***now. over the line? my friend feels bad about it.
this guy i've known for a little over a year,is asking me for pics,not nude ones,just revealing ones.and he promised me he wouldnt show them to anyone.should i believe that?should i really be sending him those kind of pics if we're not together? 
I had been with a guy for a while when i sent him so sexy pics..we are now broken up and im scared he may show them to his friends..i have never felt so dumb

so me and my boyfriend have been going out for almost a year on and off.we recently broke up but then got back together the night after we had sex.we broke up because he was talking to other girls and acting diff towards me.was i wrong to tke hm bak
My boyfriend & I were at a party, & he took me home around 3 in the morning... Almost 2 months later I start hearing things from other people that he cheated on me so I asked & he denied it, but come to find out he really did... Should I stay w/ him?
This guy and i have been datin for 7 months and we like eachother a lot. My ex has been constantly asking me back out and i dont want to say yes. The thing is i dont like to see him with another girl. Is this bad???
My ex keeps pressuing me into going back out with him. He would curse me out because im not with him and im happily in a 7month relationship. Am i wrong for not wanting to go back pout with him ? Or is he wrong for pressuing me?
me and this guy have gone out numerous times and always end up breaking up...i really like him  and he says he likes me again but i dont know what to do because he wants nude pictures and i really dont want to but i know they would make him happy
I feel followed. My ex always asking what i'm doing and who i'm with. He gets angry and curses at me when i'm with my boyfriend. He claims he's in love with me,but I'm starting to feel like im loosing control over the situation... help?!
My ex boyfriend sent my personal messages about my personal problems to ALL of his contactsl
i met this guy on vacation and we ending up having sex. its been months and we still talk, but its breif and he talks of how horny he is and we end up doing bad things. he says hell visit and he likes me but is he just using me for his own pleasure?
My Boyfriend Dumped me for my bestfriend & He talked a whole mess of bad stuff about me how iLet myself do stuff with him which is not true & iFound out that he cheated on me But now he wants to get bak.But still talks bad stuff.

"my exboyfriend of 3 years still loves me, but he tells me how much he wants to get sexual with me. Eversince we became ""sexual"" he keeps asking for more and more. Sometimes, he gets mad because i don't get ""sexual"" with him. "
I feel like my ex is obsessed w|me. He gets mad when im with my bf [been together for almost 7months]. He curses at me when i dont want to hang w|him. He always asks who i'm with and where im at. over the line?
My boyfriend of 1 year never tells me who he is talking to, he always lies about it. I don't know what to say or do. &He also told me if he didn't love me he would probably cheat on me. :( What should I do?

I created a fake twitter account of this one kid and started posting funny/offensive things. Whoops.
I dated this boy, for about a week...we realized it wasn't going to work out. So i broke up with him, he then told everyone at the school i had sex with him a day after dating. But he keeps texting and calling me telling me he wants me back.. no way.
My x-boyfriend was a great guy till i found out he was in love with my sister... Im afraid they were sneaking around my back.... the sad thing about this is i miss him :/
My ex broke up with me for alcohol and he's only 17. He pressures me to have sex with him. He won't let me go out and meet other people, but I know he's with other girls.
mah ex boy friend once too a video of me gettin dress after i got out the shower when i was in his house without me knowin. I found out about it when one of his home boys told me that  i was a video hoe because he seen a video of me. 
i thought these girls were my friends. i got a new bf they hated so they went around callin me a slut and a whore and telling people i was giving him oral sex at school. but they talk so openly about sex and what theyve done and with who. 
My boyfriend of 4 years went to Mexico for spring break.  Four months later i accidentally logged into his facebook and found several pages of messages from a girl he had met down there.  They talked trash and talked of kissing! Cheating? I think so.
I was sexting a guy even tho it was nothing I would usually do. But I trusted him to keep it to himself. Well he didnt, he showed all his friends who was my all my friends too and it really embarrassed me. I lost alot of trust for him.
my boyfriend constantly makes fun of me whether it's the music i'm listening to or the things i say. he dislikes all of my friends who he's not friends with. he puts me down and makes me feel so stupid and vulnerable. why am i still with him?
Ok so this guy i fell head over heals in love with told me for the first time he loved me!!! i was super excited so i went out for a night with all my girl friends and i saw him in the club making out with another girl
I was w/ this guy 4 like 10 months but it wasn't working so i broke up w/ him. started 2 hang out w/ a new guy n my ex found out. next thing my ex is saying my full name n how i'm a whore n how i did herion n all kinds of messed up stuff on myspace.
I just got back with my ex recently and he claims he loves me and we are constantly together.. but he is so secretive when it comes to his phone and is always sending flirtatious texts to girls he used to like..
my ex boyfriend use to make me call him from my house phone after i was already talking to him on my cell becuz he didnt believe i was home
My bff and I snuck some guys over one night and we each had sex and she had a bf who she cheated on. My rents found condoms the next morning, and I told them the truth. But she told her rents and bf it was only me that did had sex, such a liar!
my exbestfriend, someone i saw as my sister, told people my deepest, darkest secret. people at school, my boyfriend (before we started dating), his mom, and even my closest friends. she ruinned my rep and tried to lie about it when i knew it was her.
"ight so, i was going out with this kid &+ he was such a sweatheart at first then all of the sudden he  changed so much; he started calling me a ***** and a *** nd all this other ****dont even no where it came from; he also cheated on me wit his ex"
me and my friend called my ex who i still had feelings for and after she went in to the bathroom and put his number into her phone and texted him and talked to him about personal things that i told her that me and him had done..
i was datin a guy foralmost 6 months, everytime we hung out we'd havesex i realy caredabt em i thought he did 2 eventually he just stopped talkin to me he would always put me dwntrash tlk 2 his friends etc. &nowhe tries2 tell me he lovesme to hook up
i met thiis guy who said he was 15 on omegle and have been emailing him..he is a little flirty but not overtheline flirty. am i stupid for talking to this guy who i havent even met? shud i ask for a pic or sumthing 4 proof that hes 15?
He asked me for a picture of me in my Bra. So i did it. And no he didnt show it to anyone, He promised. So far he has kept his promise. Then later on hes asked  for a naked picture, entirely. Should I? I knw him and i think i can trust him.
I really like this guy and he's so nice and sweet when it's just me and him but around other people he's a completely ass.!
My ex boyfriend would always think I was cheating on him or I was going to cheat on him. He would take my phone and if a single boy had txted me I was automatically cheating. I had to stop talking to all my guy friends. In the end he was the cheater.
"this boy is kind of shy but he always trys to sext my friend and wants a ""sexy"" pic but she doesnt know him well at all and she wont send him a ""sexy"" one so he gets mad "
I started talking to an old bf and he was being all sweet and told me to send a naked picture to him, and i only showed half of my body.  I asked what he did with the pictures and said he saved them.  Now he wont talk to me after i sent the pictures.
"I dated a boy for a year when i was 14...& i would sent him ""suggestive"" pictures. And those pictures got around & not by him showing anyone but by someone getting his phone & sending it to their phone to send to other people."
so this guy he is like a bro to me,but  wen he comes ovr to my house for lyk a bbq or movie night wif friends he always ends up sittin next to me and lyk puttin his handdown thereand up der & i try not to let him bt if i dnt he gets mad so i let him.
I met a guy, we got along great until I felt like he rushed me to put out. Then when I thought I might have feelings for him he starts acting jealous, ordering me around in bed, then telling me its better when I don't talk. Should I give up on him?
my bf and i have been together for 4months and i really like him things are good most of the time... but he goes out of town ALOT and whenever he does i flirt alot with other guys and wanna hook up with other guys i havent but have thought bout it :/
my bf boke up woth me recently and ive been talking to my guy friends for help. they are also friends with my ex and i was playing with my guy friends phone an saw a convo between the 2 talking crap about me. im confused and thought he was on my side
I have a BF, we've been together for 4months.. things are good but when he goes out of town wich is ALOT.. i always flirt with other guys and i've even though about cheating on him sometimes? i know i wanna be with him though...
my 'best friend' use to full on flirt with the guy i was talking to right in front of me, they'd hold hands and sometimes even make jokes about having sex, he'd even tell her how beautiful he thought she was when i was there with them.
My gf has been calling my friends and even called my sister to find out what I was doing at all hours of the day.  She doesn't trust me and truthfully I have never cheated on her or anyone and i haven't done anything to make her believe I have. 
"A ""Bestfriend"" Had Told Me Her Mom Had Cancer To Get Out Of A Lie . "

"I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months now. When I see him he goes through my phone, to ""check up."" He does it in front of me and it's starting to bother me.  I know he has trust issues but I'm scared this is a sign he's becoming more controlling."
"Im a little overweight. My best friend, who is a guy, responded with something i said with ""whatever, your fat"", it really hurt me, i pretended it didnt,i've been ignoring him.i have really low self esteem should i tell him it hurt me or get over it?"
this guy posted a pic of me naked!
I know a girl who tells me that she gets more comfort being lied to by a guy because it makes her feel better for the time. She even says this guy shes been with has tried to get her pregnant because they thought it would be funny. Over the line?

my first love and I had sex, I thought I was pregnant and he told me if I was he would deny the baby because his ex gf would find out. she calls him fat and ugly and talks so much **** about him, i loved him and he broke me.
i have been going out with this guy for a couple of years and just recently discovered that he is my brother........  what should i do??
Im in love with this guy. But he only wants to go out with me secretly, because Im not hot enough for his friends.
my bf keep talkin sex talk to me and i dont really like it and he get mad when i dont talk like that back he never really just talk to me.. b4 we started dating he was fine and never was like this at all. i dont knw how to talk to him

"My sister is 16 years old. She had sex with her boyfried a couple weeks ago. They keep getting into fights and she drags me into the fights. She had me ""Blackmail"" him cus they recently got into a fight. Is this wrong?"
I was really close to one of my friends, then she decided out of no where to hate me. She told everyone all my secrets I told her, and turned all my friends against me so they're all two faced against me.
Ok is it ok for a gurl goin into the 7th to hav more than one boyfriend at the same time and sleeping wit each of them and then later breaking up wit them for no reason
mybff is totaly becoming a ****- sending naked pics, being friends with benefits to like, 5 different dudes!- i wana tell her that she's being realy *****, but i dont want to hurt her feelings or ruin our friendship,& idk if she'l listen whatdoido?
"so i had this boyfriend for 10 months and my ""BFF"" is telling him that im cheating on him, and all this other stuff that should have been kept between me and her.and now it seems like she is trying to get at him. SOME BEST FRIEND RIIGGHT?"
i was on videochat with this guy and hewas lyk take off ur shirt & i did then pants & i did. he did too. his friend tld me the next day that he was recording, and posted it a bulliten on myspace
school this year changed me. i did things tht i shouldnt of with a boy nd everyone hated me but he eventually started spreading rumors about me tht really hurt me. i knw he doesnt deserve me but i cant keep my mind off him and i dont know wht to do .
me and my x bf have been talking and sent dirty things to eachother. he endedd up showing his bestfriend the txt's. what should i do?
it's a bunch of girls at my skool that are jealous of me bcz im gay but boys still like me. i go out with this girl nd shes the smile on my face. in gym class a girl took my fone nd took a message my gf sent me nd showed it to everyone! now im single
I'm a hypocrite. I constantly call other people fat or ugly in a joking manner. When other people do it, I get mad at them. I'm really popular at my school. I'm also gay, and I think some people allow me to make fun of them because of it.
my bff has always been the type of grl that falls for guys that treat her wrong and its like she never learns her lesson. But wat really got me was that she took a picture of her chest and sent it to a guy cuz he asked her. think its over the line?
i have been with the same guy for two years. he calls me names like crybaby. **** and cusses me out. i love him but its reall not okay. he needs to learn. is it time to move on? 
My best friend (and I) are bi, so she asked me to send her a nude pic. I did and she sent it to what she thought was her friend's phone, but it was his mom's and his mom came to my house and told my mom.
so my bffl is on vacation and her bf couldnt come. i use to hate him, but we've been hanging out lately and i really like him. he kissed me last night and now im trying to avoid him but he's txting me like crazy! my bffl comes back in 3 days! help!
my ex and i had been goin out since november of last year. we always chilled and did sexual things w/each other. this month i found out he had a girlfriend in another town the whole time. it hurts bad, and he claims our relationship was just a bet
So I'm ****** like everyone i meet lately and they all seem to tell me that I'm not relationship material because I'm fat and ugly. How do I trick them into staying for more then one night, should I just accept the paper bag treatment?
a friend of my brother's  came over looked in my wallet, counted all my money then left the next day. i look in my wallet to find its all gone. 250+ dollars. pretty sure he did it but have no proof. he says he didnt but he could easily be lying
"Last yr. i was ""dating"" this guy,  me and him were in his bed. he pressured me into doing it. the next day he called me a **** and said that was the only reason he wanted me. his OTHER gf kept IM'ing saying i deserved everything he did to me. help?"
okay so i just met this guy at a fair the other day and I'm really attracted to him, he has a girlfriend, which is also one of my good friends. He Flirts with me alot and i think he's interested. the only thing that  bothers me is he's 21 yrs old.
so i jus broke up with my bf and we havent talked for a while . then 1 day he jus texted me askinq if i had a bf . ive been with my new bf for a month now . so i told him and he called me a ***** then sed he was jokinq . over the line ?
My bf just recently pased away. We have been dating since the 9th grade. I had sent him some pics. After he died his mom went threw his phone and went insane! She wouldnt let me anywhere near him at his wake and funeral just over some pics! 
"i was talking for this guy for almost 3 months and he asked me to send him a  ""sexy"" picture. when i sent him a regualar one he got upset saying that i didn't trust him. I told him i wasn't going to do it, and he told me to never talk to him agian."
One of my best friends sent this dude a naked pic and now everyone in school has seen it.he even posted it in the boys bathroom she doesnt know only me and my other friends do. should we tell her?
Me and my boyfriend have been together for 11months but earlier in our relationship he cheated on me and im still not over it, he knows how bad it hurt me but he just says i dont understand and he still sees the girl. Should i let him go ?
My boyfriend goes onto my facebook and deletes people and Im's who he wants to and he even subscribed to my messages so when i get a new message it sends to his phone too. Is this too much?
I really like this boy. I always look at his myspace to read his moods and stuff. Im always texting/calling him asking him where hes at, who his with, and stuff like that. Do you think that im being like a stalker? Am I going to far?
I feel like my Boyfriend is one of those guys who likes girls bodys. i feel like i need to get his attention to send him nude photos of me. I do, and his friends say they've seen them, But he claims he never sent them. Should i have not?.. to much?
what if you like a guy and say your dad doesnt like him,he hasnt even met him, hes just judging him for his race... :/
My ex told me 2 send a pic of my boobs 2 him. He said he wouldnt show any1 or tell any1. In return, he would send a pic of his ****. Turns out, he finds pics off the net & sends them 2 girls. This ruined my life, so never EVERRR do it.
i have been with my girlfriend for 3 years and just asked her to be my fiance 2 months ago. she cheated on me with a guy who works with her and has kissed him 6 times over a period of a month. i have stayed faithfull and dont know if i should forgive
should i stop thinking about this guy that has broken my heart alottttt, his dad hates me, he stopped talking to me, spreads rumors about me? & just blah blah. i can't stop thinking about him at all.
my bf has anger is problem he get mad so easy and like i cant say anything with out him get mad at me.. i love him but i cant stand it anymore
I'm secretly gay and I make fun out of other kids  who are openly gay to fill my void and pain.
MY BF IS ALWAYS SAYING ****HER BODIES HOT OMG THIS GIRLS HOT AND I FEEL LIKE CRAP &I FEEL NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I TOLD HIM I FEEL LIKE CRAP &HE GOT MAD AND SAID R U REALLY GETTING MAD OVER THIS ****? IS HE OVER THE LINE? ADVICE?!? COMMENT WHAT DO I DO?
I'm texting this boy i really like and we talk about sex alot. we don't sext we just talk about how we're going to have it I know that i would never have sex with him but i have a feeling he shows his friends. should i trust him?
I'm 13 and i'm texting a guy i really like we talk about having sex but we don't sext or via or anything. I don't know if i can trust him. I have a feeling he shows his friends. Can i trust him?
my mom dosent let me do anything cant go out or hang with friends beacuse i told her i was gay like what should i do i talk to her but she says she is not rasing a gay son should i run away
I have a friend that was talking to someone that treats girls bad. She didn't tlisten to us & sent him nudes. They aren't together, he heard she did things with someone else & sent her pics to all her friends. He thinks it wasn't bad. Wasn't it?
Since 2005, Ive been called fat, ugly, annoying, stupid and weird online.  I cant even look in the mirror anymore. I have also been told by the guy that I liked that I didn't deserve to live. I thought he was right. I still do sometimes.
I am in love with someone elses boyfriend. He says he loved me back.  We're going to take a trip in a few months together..  I'm not sure if this is a a good idea.
okay im married but im not inlove with him im inlove with someone else i met him online idk how it happen but it did where going to meet real soon  my husband goes through my stuff and stays mad at me all the time we never can comunicate well
i met this girl and shes only 13 and shes sending nudes and dirty txtz she says that she sends them cuz shes in love with me wat should i do
i am a straight A student and i work really hard to impress my parents. but when i try to do something funny my mom accuses me of being on drugs. i have never done any drugs in my life and don't plan on it. she says it so much i cry because it hurts 
Four years ago I stole my friend at the times bf when they were on a break. I met up with her for the frist time since then and she says she still loves him. I didn't tell her that the reason he won't text her back is because we are hooking up again.
I started dating this guy a while ago. We were together for a year and a half but broke up. Now we're going back out and he wants to do stuff since we've had so much history. Is it over the line to do stuff cause we're only 14?
"i just found out my bf has been ""talkin"" to my ex bff for 3 weeks now. said he loved her & wanted to be with her and everythin. i asked him about it and he told me. he said he wanted to be with me and was goin to end them. but hsnt yet. what do i do?"
Me and this guy have been on again off agin for about 1 year and i feel like i actually love him but everyone says he just uses me he has talked about having sex even tho we dont go out but maube if we have sex he will get bak with me
Im a freshmen and when I was in 7th grade I hooked up with 2 older kids.they promised not to tell but big surprise,they told everyone.Now I feel like every guy that talks to me only wants to hook up.Is it bad that I do stuff with any guy that asks?
I met this guy through a friend, and sometimes he's really nice (:  but alot of the time he calls me fat and **** and yells . we've made out a few times as well 
I'd been w/ my bf for a yr. 4 days after we broke up he was fully commited to another girl. 3 months later, I now find out tht he had been tlking to his current gf and hangin out w/ her behind my back before we broke up. Is what he did over the line?
so i met this guy through some friends, we ended up making out as a dare, and then some other times.. but when he's around he's sometimes really nice but others he yells at me and calls me a **** and fat and ugly and degrades me
i have this guy friend that is reallly nice but hes always asking me to send him sexy pic or pics of my **** or **** n i say no be cause im not a **** so sorry n the next day he doesnt talk to me n calls me a **** not cool right?????????????????????
In 6th grade all the girls in my class would talk about me but use a different name so I didn't know. They called her fat and ugly. To this day, I still can't look in a mirror without thinking about the things they said and every time I cry. 
I met this guy online and we got along great, he said he loved me and I believed him. I sent him nudes and then he told me it was all a joke. I feel like this is all my fault....
So my ex-boyfriend got me pregnant and cheated on me with my BFF now she's pregnant our due dates are one month apart and now he's with our other friend. He isn't claiming either of our babies and says he was never with us & she's denying knowing us
I used to have a really close friend who I trusted. I told her that I had sex with my boyfriend and she decided to tell the whole school. Even my family knows about it. She continues to claim she didn't tell anyone, when I KNOW it was her...
i hav a bf who has to check my fb, my txts& has to kno who im txtin & wht im doin 24-7 & gets mad at me 4 just little things. hes controling & hypocritial cause he txts girls 2 we both love eachother, idk if i can take this,i dont want 2 hurt him
every single guy i meet online and start texting always asks 'do you send nudes' i say no. of course. but they won't stop bugging me. its like i can't have a real guy friend, or a realy boyfriend without them asking for gross things. : / idk.........
okay so my boyfriend of eight months to this day still reads my text messages and emails and keeps track of who i talk to and where i go. i live with him and everytime we talk in person or over the phone he interagates me like a criminal!!! 
my ex hadnt talked to me for weeks then all of a sudden he texts me and asks me for a nude photo. i cant say no to someone im still inlove with and i thought hed leave me alone after i sent it,a week later his best friend asks me for 1 
"So, my girlfriend of 3 and a half years, started to stop hanging out with me and lying where she was at night, come to find out she's been partying and sleepting over one of my""casual"" friends house, and i caught her one night and sheignored my calls"
"I have been bullied online many times. And then people just say ""oh i was just joking and i didn't mean it"" Just so they didn't have to face it in person. I'm sick of it and it needs to be stopped! It leads to death for some people..."
is it over the line if u cheated on your gf 3 days after dating but you didn't mean to and stay with her for over 5 motnhs without telling her?
me nd my bf planed to have sex a day before v-day,we had been together for 3months.a couple days later he broke up with me..like two months later we endd up hookin up at a party..nd he started calin me a **** nd stuf,now he wants to hoook up again
I went out with this boy for about nine months. We broke up.A couple of weeks later he went out with another girl. Few weeks later he was telling me he wants to do sexual things with me. I'm debating if I should do the same with him, would I look bad
me and this guy are dating all he wants is nude pics so i sent him one and then all of his friend were telling me how sexy i am and how they want sex is this over the top
My boyfriend of 9 months is amazing, theres one flaw. Jealously. It shows most when i get a text, he makes a dash over to me to see who it was . But, if i ask to look at his phone... yeah he NEVER lets that happen. Is this over the line? 
My ex is also my bestfriend. and Im jelous of his new girlfriend, but he tells me he still loves me and all. well he asked me back out and broke up again saying hes not ready for another relationship. then less than a week lter he goes back to her.
"my ex and i wentOut 4months,heWouldAlwaysBeAsking for ""sexy""pictures,EVERYONE knew he wasOnlyGoing outWith me ForMyBody,iPromisedHimMyVirginity,its been 3months& heHas a different gf.i HAVE sent him pictures inMy bra &all but to this daWe Still Sext."
When I started with my bf of 7 month it was great, he was jealous of only 1 guy, and no he is gealous of every guy that talks to me, daily searches my fb and Mys, make a big deal out of the smallest thing, and we fight every day more than once
i have been with my boyfriend for three years,i've cheated multiple times,i love him with all my heart. he doesn't know about the cheating,i dont want to tell him bc i dont think its worth breaking someones heart when it mean nothing, im done with it
my bf and i have been dating for 3years, i've cheated multiple times, not with sex, bc i am still a virgin, but other things, i dont want to tell him, bc i love him and i dont think its worth breaking his heart over if it meant nothing to me
When I started with my bf of 7 month it was great, he was jealous of only 1 guy, and no he is jealous of every guy that talks to me, daily searches my fb and Mys make a big deal out of the smallest thing, and we fight every day more than once
my best friend went out with my enemy she thinks its no big deal but it really bugs me that she would do that. she  lies to me about everything and tells people not to like me...but we have been friends for like 4 years....help?
my best friend says she wants to be together but is to afraid to dump her bf because she thinks he will start rumors about her and ruin her life. but i am not allowed to even talk to my friends w/o getting yelled at is this fair or over the line?
I BEEN WITH MY BF FOR 5 YEARS AND HE COMES HOME EVERYDAY FRUM WORK AND SAYS IM CHEATING ON HIM AND THAT IVE HAD GUYS IN HERE IDK WAT TO DO ANY MORE IM REALLY GETTING SICK OF IT WAT DO U DINK I SHOULD DO?
my ex boyfriend has been having sex with another girl for the past couple months. he started when we were still together. but he still tells me that he loves me and wants to be together. we are still having sex and saying i love you.
so my bestfriend has this boyfriend and i like him. me and him secretly text and mess around behind her back, i wana tell her whats goin on but she has did this to me before so a big part of me wants her to suffer like i did. is this over the line?
My boy friend cheats on me. The girl he cheated on is now pregnant. What should I do?

So my friend has a new texting buddy and he i asking for pics constantly and one day he told her to send a naked pic. she's always asking for my opinion if she should send one to him and i dont know what to tell her. Is this over the line ?
okay so i'm reading these posts, seems like a lot of people are only 13 years old with adult problems, over the line much? i think so!
my boyfriend of 3 years now doesn't trust me at all and i never gave him a reason not to, i can't hang out with my friends or even his own sister without it turning into a fight, i'm not sure what to do i can't take this anymore its rediculous!
I met this guy online and he wants me to be his gf. I have never met him in person, and he is two years older than me. He wants to meet and I think he said he wanted to make out when we did. Should I agree to meet him?
i had a problem that people made fun of me in ways that you couldnt imagine.. (people called me names,made fun of me and wouldnt leave me alone) i wrote songs to get rid of all the pain and hate in my heart i showed it to my teacher and i thought he
My husband is constantly falsely accusing me of infidelity everyday. I can't do normal everyday activities without him somehow connecting it to cheating. I have to be under his supervision all the time and he is always stalking and spying on me. 
"My girlfriend has sex with my best friend and plays it off as casual ""hanging out"" (kinda literal) what should I do"
"My boyfriend doesn't like me to talk to guys, at all. But we exchanged fb passwords and he messages girls from his past telling them how they've ""grown up and look good"" and a lot of shady stuff. Yet I can't even have guy FRIENDS? Over the line?"
im in love with this guy and he wants to have sex with me but im scared. he thinks im not a virgin but i am and when he touches me i feel umconfortable sometimes i love him and i don't wanna loose him but he just want me to have sex with him.
ok so lets face it i am a beautiful black female ,and i have the body to fit the description ,but it seem like everytime a guy gets my # they always ask for SEX ,or a nude pic , i really wanna know how to manaqe this situation, and they still like me
i sext with this guy a lot, we talk about the ethings he wants to do to me. sometimes he scares me and i think he is crazy and he has told me that he would like to have sex with me. and sometimes i want to be with him but im scared.over the line?
i have been dating this guy for 3 years, he hasn't always been the most trustful guy, but he can really sweet. in the last 3 years he has sent pictures of himself to other girls, he and my friend kissed behinde my back, he told me the next day,
i get a text a day later from him after my text and he says he doesn't want to meet in erson he wants to end things. i was stunned. i invested into a 3 year relationship with him and he breaks up with me over a text with no reason.
Things between my bf and i are terrible, especially since i had our baby. But lately, he's telling people we aren't together and always flirting with other girls. i wanna try and keep us together for our duaghters sake. but idk how to make him stop.
I dated this senior (I'm a junior) for about a year and i lost my virginity to him, and he broke up with me and i later found out he had sex with another girl and hooked up with another girl while we were dating. Now he wants me back, what do i do?
"My BF was giving me oral the other day, im 13 and he is 13, and he went to touch the top of my ""area"" with his finger and his nail scratched it! It's really sore and it's swollen. I told my mom but she is sueing him! What do i do!!!"

"My friend keeps asking for ""sexy"" pictures and I dont want to. When I tell him no he uses the guilt trip on me"

 People say bad things because Im spanish. This one person told me to go back to Mexico but I was born in the US and people talk about my teeth because they are not straight people say hold your head up and dont worry but I dont know how long I can.
This guy I know has been totally pressuring me into sending him pictures topless/in a thong. & I'm really tired of it. I keep trying to tell him no, but still keep him interested (because I like him) I'm so confused about it all. 
People have always spread rumors about me, made fun of me, and tried to humiliate me, They always leave random stuff in my inbox on my phone, call me on private, leave hateful things on my wall and formspring. even my bestfriends call me names.

My friend and I tease people on facebook and texts all the time. It seems funny and fun at the time but now we look back on it the people didnt deserve any of it. We would do it to people we barely knew and it probally really hurt there feelings.

Back in February, my boyfriend kept insisting that I was unfaithful to him while I only would talk and be with him 24/7. I still try to talk to him about this now, but he still thinks the same. He also made me delete my Facebook. What should I do?
it hurts so much. then they call you dumb for getting upset. well of course im going to be upset because i know im not dumb, fat or ugly. but after a while i start to believe what they are saying is true. what should i do about the people being mean?
5th-7th grade i was called fat ugly,and no friends 8th-9th i started sports and became popular now im doing what other people did to me . If you really knew me you would know im a sweet person,but i do the things i do because of my surroundings.
i dated this kid for a while but he would always talk about his ex sayin so-n-so would do this.. and w.e but he told me he was over her...so i stayed with him but like i found out he cheated on me with her. and he lied to me and hid stuff from me

"I was left a voicemail that said ""Nobody likes you, they hope you all die in a hole. You have no friends. Byeeeee."" Then, the person wouldn't confront me about it at school. So, I was left friendless and alone."
People at school make fun of me for being gay. I'm afraid to enter high school with this going on. I get teased and tripped in the hall-ways and even have stuff thrown at me.. What should I do?
I created a new AIM account and told a girl everything I hated about her
I recently had a harsh breakup with my boyfriend of 7 months. He dealt with it by posting personal messages about me on my facebook, which got me into trouble with not only my friends but my parents. any now i am in therapy. Over the Line? maybe...
The boy i like he changed n not in a good way,when istarted having sex with him things took a turn da hugs stopped the txting stop i like him so much i even snd him pics of my body he treats me like dirt now. should i leave him alone?
Okay so my boyfriend texts me all the time asking me who I'm with or where I am. He even believe that I cheated on him after prom because I didn't answer my phone(it was in my car). I feel like I'm suffocating. Is this over the line?
people at school are horrible they found out im gay and its not like im a girly guy im verry mature and manly but they dont understand especially the guys they are the worst and ya know the question is why? why do they have to be mean? anyone help?
My boyfriend calls me fat ugly and tells me i eat too much and need to work out..i wanna leave him but its hard..he was my first everything

"I sat in fron of these boys who were commenting on everyone in the room. When I sat down, one of them started saying ""And what is that?"" And the other said ""Oh, that's the **** beast"" I almost cried right there. They make me feel worthless, stupid."

i was with my boyfriend and i took a nap on his couch and he took my phone when i was sleeping and walked out of the room and read all my texts, he yelled at me for texting this one kid, and i broke up with him was he over the line for not trusting?
My familyy is horrible. My mom favors my sister(who im always compared to) and my dad constantly tells me im stupid and i cant do anything right. On top of that everyone at my school literally hates me.
all these seniors started askin me to have sex,  i have a older brother who was also a senior. he thought he was alll cool , & i wanted to be cool too. so when his friends asked me for sex, i gave in..rumors spred about me & my brother is FURIOUS :(

My gf and i have been together for a yr and she is still very controlling of me she deletes ppl out my phone and off of my websites like myspace and facebook. She has messed around before and ive never cheated why is she like this?
"This story might be a 2 parter. I was Cyber Bullied on Myspace once, It was Her and Her ex-bf. They left me harmful comments on my status stream. They told me to ""**** Off and Get a Life"" she called me a Major ****, Poser, Fake, a Lie. "

A girl hacked my boyfriend's page and put how I was a whore, ugly, a bad person, how I was gay, should go die, and about a thousand other things. She then texted me worse things and left me lots of voice messages. I felt horrible.
So im interested in guys that have nice cars, it doesnt matter what they look like as long as they have nice things&them buying me nice things even though i want to be successful myself&become a dermatologist. Do you know why im like this?

"I Was Dating This Guy *** For 8 Months. I Was So Inlove With Him. One Day he Wrote Me On IM And Dumped Me Right Then And There. 3 Days Later He Started Dating This Girl And Talking To One Of My ""Best Friends"" I Was So Hurt. I Wish I Could Move On.."
"People in my school tend to call me a Lesbian, due to the fact that I don't date often. Frankly, I am straight and I get SO upset when people say that; just because no one knows my dating life. My own Dad even called me a Lesbian. It just hurts. :("
 so my bf sent naked pictures to me and threatened me to send some to him come to find out he was sending them to alot more girls and had  another gf .
Everyone looks at me with one thing on there minds. They all think of me as a slut. i have a very big personality. But when im nice to a guy an i get a hug form them, that it makes me a slut. They assume whats not true. If only they really knew me!
The guy I lost my virginity to makes me feel like I have to talk dirty & I have to do things I don't feel comfortable doing. He makes it seem like its the only way he'll still talk to me because we weren't in a relationship but we do feel each other.
Growing up I havent been the skinnest girls. When I first started Middle School people would always make fun of my wieght. Because of that I would always tell my self that I was fat and ugly and i really took it to heart. And it still follows me.
I constantly get asked to send naked pictures to numerous guys. Many guys think im into that stuff, when im really not. I dont know what to say to the guys who ask.
BFF killed himself back in 2005 we were very closeon the anni of his death I posted that I loved & missed him &had wished that he was here w/me I got over hundred any kind of message from people asking me if i was finally going to kill myself...
When I moved I was constantly harrased. In 7th grade, I became pretty. I had boyfriends, and a ton of friends. Recently, I sent out a lot of nude pics to a guy older than me. Being pretty wasn't enough to erase the damage from 2nd to 6th grade.
I was cyber-bullied once. I defended myself by saying some mean stuff back. I report it to my principal. And Both the bully and I got suspended. Later that day, On myspace, One of the bully's friend said she would get the whole school to beat me up.
after a bad breakup i posted nude pictures of my ex on myspace that were supposed to be private instead of being the bigger person i crossed the line and posted those.
my boyfriend is an ******* and i hve been thinking about leaving but im pregnant and dont want to raise a kid alone. i have no idea what to do.
so i sent a nude photo and no one saw it but him. the school board found out and people started to find out. people would always ask me for nudes but it has gotten better. i wish i could go back and change it. i wish i would of said NO! D:
You'd be surprised to know that I'm 20 years old and the people from my high school, still bother to trash me online every opportunity that they get. It's something that never seems to end.. what's with the immaturity these days ? Help ?!?!
I found Nude pictures of my best friend on my boyfriends computer, THAT HE HAD TAKEN. we'd been together 3 years. I copied them and made a fake myspace w/ them on it. everyone saw - I'm still her best friend, though she has no idea i did it. 
I have lost alot of my family members. My only true blood family is my mom and my great-aunt who isnt really around. I feel that i have to hold in everything. Even now i am thinking of deleting this message.I really dont know what to do.
everytime i try talking to a new guy , it starts off with the cute text then it goes on to the sexy pictures.. and i feel pressured and dont know if i should send it or not. Most of these guys are older than me and obviously they are more experience.
i went to the bathroom while i was over my friends house and i left my phone on the table and when i came back everything was fine then we were talking and she qouted something i said in a text and i found out she read all my PERSONAL texts 
My family doesn't treat me like i belong. They treat me like some random girl that lives with them. They act like im the meanest thing they ever seen and im not that mean. Now they want me out and on the streets. I cry everyday cuz of it. Plz Help!? 
"One time my ""friend"" thought i was being fake on facebook.So she posted things on my wall and cussing me out with this other girl,my sis talked to them to get them off my page.then my friends came back and said""I just was helping so you wont be fake"""
this past school yr i sent a few nude pics to my ex boyfriend... a few days later i got a phone call frm a friend of mine sayin tht she had seen alot of ppl looking at the pics. Evn now some ppl know me as the girl tht sends nude pics.. shulda sed no
I hate how I have to feel around my dad because I feel ashamed about how I get mad at him over the stupidest things and then he will come ome from work feeling hurt and battling his disease from diabetes and I will sometimes regret what I say
I try and act like I'M SKINNY by sucking in my stomach  and starving myself at school untilschool end and I try and  I try to make others somertime feel  bad about their selves and theres that other side of me thats different
Once this girl that me and alot of my firends hated started talking ****. so when we saw a picture of her and one of are friends we started talking **** it turned into a big controversy with her including her mom. there were alot of threats.

I used to like this guy. I got online and started talking to my friend, and she starts insulting me, calling me stupid, ugly, and a slut for liking him. I was so angry and hurt I was crying to sleep. The next day she said someone hacked her account.
I told a man I love very much that he is a womanizer,liar,and , a drunk and I can't live with that so then he started calling me names and then it really got much worse with verbal attacks and this was all on the phone and texting
This kid posted a paragraph about me, using profanity and cussing me out, he did thid because he heard about something that happened between me and this girl, and he didn't even know the whole story between us. he got all of his friends against me!
My best friend changed. She was saying things like she doesn't care about me anymore, that shes sick of me, that shes put up with me too long. She yelled at me online, insulting me, & I called my other best friend and cried for hours over the phone.
So recently Ive had a lot of hook ups, not sex but everything else. Theres six guys I hook up with and they all know about eachother and dont care. My friends always get mad at me for being a ****though and now I like a guy who just wants a hook up
Recently, I sent a couple pictures to this guy that I like. They were all nude. It started out with this normal picture and it progressed on from there. He has a girlfriend. He never wants to be together again. I have no idea what to do now. 
My guy friend always texts me NON-STOP. One day we hung out, and he started feeling my up and tried to take off my shirt. I told him that im not into him like that. Right after, he took off and hasnt speaked to me since. Was he just using me?
 im a nice person i try to make friends but no one wants to be my friend i get made fun of about my weight everyday by boys at my school and i just cant take it so i just walk away and dont listen but i always go home and cry its just so painful 
I have been with my bf for 3 years He has no trust for me and always thinks Im cheating but I find out all the time that he trys to hook up with other girls He calls me crazy and finds a way to make it seem like he did nothing wrong and I did
There are a lot of popular girls at my school that hate me because I dated the most popular guy and broke up with him. They have written stuff on walls and Facebook. One even said I should kill myself. What should i do?
me&a friend posted mean things about a girl on twitter, but she didnt have a twitter so we didnt think she'd c it. she found the tweets and got upset. was it still wrong 4 us 2 post them even if we didnt think she'd c them?
I ask GOD yesterday to get me though this day... where i had to tell my sister that her boyfriend from 13yrs, tryed to pay me for sex. my sister is hurt and i am too she went though alot with him. this **** is soo deep that i cant put the whole story.
I'm pregnant and single and dont know who the dad is. 4 guys have to have a paternity test. One is already married, another does shrroms. i got back with an ex we've been having lots of sex and im going to tell him the baby is his.
my ex told everyone that we had sex even though we didnt ... now even ppl at my church think we did, and i was notoriously the girl who's saving herself for marriage but now they think im a *****. i just dnt want ppl to think false things about me...
I'm not comfortable in my own skin. I get made fun of because of my weight and how I look. I feel alone everywhere I go and the people who I think are my friends don't treat me like everyone else.
i was born with a skin problem called excema and ever since th grade i have been made fun of it by a group of boys literally putting me through a living hell. this made me thing i was ugly worthles and had no reason of living all because of my skin.
In the 8th grade i was made fun of all the time. The things people done to me was anywhere from calling me fat to putting a pad on my back and it all got worst from there. This year even a teacher made fun of me, I cant take it anymore
I'm a 14 year old girl, everyday I go to school I am picked on because the religion that I am. My parents are Muslim like I am and the rest of my family is Christian. I get called terrorist, al-qaeda lover. It hurts so bad & I wish it would stop
Everyone, and I mean everyone, says I'm fat. My mom, my dad, my brother, my best friends, everyone. It's gotten to the point that I want to completely leave society and live alone.
people laugh and make fun of me becaus i have autism and i'm a gamer! i freakin hate it!!!
After breaking up with my ex, His friends commented on his facebook page about how ugly I was and how I wasn't worth anything. They didn't even know that the true side of the story was that he never really loved me anyway.
"My ""bff"" of 2 years is mad @ me for something realy stupid (that I didn't even do). She called me a stupid *****, she called me a liar, she told her friends what I ""did"" and now every time I walk by they cuss at me & they r spreading rumors about me "
I'm not myself, at all really. I just want to fit in with the kids at my school but I get called fat almost everyday. Now I believe it and I think I'm disgusting because the kids at school. :/
I have a medical conditon called NF. From that there is a tumor behind my eyelid. That pushes against the skin which causes it to swell and make it look like I have a lazy eye. And people made fun of me for it. When that happend I felt like an alien.
"my bro had a friend over that knew i drink,so he wanted a party i got smashed and all I remember is going to my room to tlk 4 a while then him taking my bra off to make me more""comfortable"" now idk if im a virgin , should I ask him what happened?"
My boyfriend wants to have sex but i dnt want to. hes 16 years old and im only 14 i dont think im ready to have sex, but he is telling me that we should have sex. that i will feel better but i dont know what to do.
I have OCD and tourettes and have always been bullied for it. Now, in high school, I've gotten better. But people still see me as the 'retard' and I have few friends. I have low confidence and am in a dark place. No one will give me a chance.
My ex boyfriend who  i loved to death sent naked pictures of me all over school because he got mad at me. I was completely humiliated. I got to court over this, im the one on house arrest. I feel like im the only one getting punished. Its not fair.
The boyfriend i have now thinks its okay to go through my phone everytime were together. He looks at all my messages and deletes all the guys numbers in my contacts. (the last bf i had sent newd pics of me around school) I know how to pick em'. : Djk
"my ex emails, blogs, and talks trash to & about me. I had 2 change my # 2x. He thinks that the ""Like"" pages on FB are written by me against him. He saw some porn that ""looked like me"" (I proved it wasn't) and went nuts on me when my dad was dying!"
the guy i lost my virginity to secretly taped us on his webcam and i wasn't told until a couple months later when all of his friends asked me how i felt to be the mini pornstar of our small town school. i dont know what to do. he doesnt know i know.
After I told my best friend I was gay, she started texting me at least two hours every day, then she invited herself over and tried to have sex with me. Ever since I said no, she's stopped talking to me. Suddenly she thinks I don't have self respect.
My ex nd iWent out on nd off my last skool year.We broke up nd iThought it would jus b jus lik da last times we broke up bt it wsnt.He went behind my bak nd tryed to get my fwends 2 hate me, even tho iGave up alot of them up already.
Me and this girl USED t2 be bestfriends but shes been changing. But ever since this new school year shes been acting out and taking advantage, drinking smoking pregnant (got an abortion] and shes****** probably 5 guys. Shud i tell her t2 stop ?
There was this guy i really liked. He wanted me to send him a dirty picture... and i did it. He promised he wouldnt tell anybody but he sent it to all his friends and told everyone he got me in bed. I dont know how to make it stop. any advise!? 
i used to cheerlder and i quit bcuz pple were saying ur nt skinny enough and i was sick of it my family tells me loose weight it seems like every1 cant except me 4 who i am im nt skinny or fat im in between but should i feel so depressed abt it?
My ex boyfriend is stalking my life and my new boyfriend's life. I used to be so close to him and it hurts so bad that we had to end on bad terms but he can't let go.He's called me derogratory and has said he wishes I'd disappear forever. this sux
When I was in 8th grade, me and my close friends bullyed a girl in our class that we were friends with. We just thought it was ok because we didn't like her anymore. Turns out she went home everyday crying and even the guys in our class bullyed her.
my best friend's mom is best friend with a mean guy in my grade's mom his mom was over at my friend's house and he got into her account. at the time i thought it was her  and he started saying mean stuff to me and swearing at me-he ruined everything.
I feel like my parents dont want much to do with me anymore. Theyre always yellin at me for something my little sister did or started. My aunt is a major put down and so is one of my best friends. My parents keep tellin me i need help..
A few months ago, I was in a fight with a guy who'd pressured me into things. It's been two months and things are better for me, I was left alone, but all of a sudden I'm being cyberbullied by him again and I don't know what to do.
When i was 13,i was crazy in love with my boyfriend we were together for three and a half months,he took my virginity,come to realzie,he just used me for sex :( he ever admitted it,he also admitted he was a player,i trusted this guy

My bf and i were having fun and fooling around on webcam. i didnt think it was a big deal bcuz it was just us and there was noway that he would show me to his friends. but i lifted my shirt for him and he took my picture and blackmailed me with it
"me and my friends make fun of the ""outcasts"" or weird kids because there nothing like us"
i had a bestfriend and we been bestfriends ever since we was in the  3rd grade when we got in the 6th grade she started having sex and doing drugs now she is telling me to do it and when i told her no she went and lied and said i did do it
My boyfriend who's 17, says that he wants to sex with me, but i told him that i dont think im ready. He kept pushing the issue and told me that if i didnt have sex with him, he'd brake up with me and tell my parents that i had sex. What should i do??
I was over a friends house and he pressured me to posting nasty comments on a girls formspring. I told her that she was a fat ***. Ever since then she has desperatly tried to loose weight and I feel its my falt.
"Last year, someone hacked my myspace account. They deleted all my pictures, comments, and re-typed my ""About Me"" saying that I was ugly and lthat I thougt i was ""the ****"". They gave out my phone number and changed my password to ""****** **** face"" "

I was harrassed over the internet. They told me everyone would be better off is i was dead. They told me everyone hates me. I got 200 inboxs within 2 day with the worst messages ever. They were the worst things i have ever heard. 
Uhh, im bi and i get made fun of alot for it. Even some of my really close friends say things about it. Even my mom. I dont think they really understand how much it does hurt me
My best friend told everyone i was cheating on my boyfriend of a year  and 4 months because she took me to see a close guy friend. We stopped being friends over it. She cheated on her boyfriend and i never told anyone. Good thing she graduated.
I met a guy at a party we exchanged numbers we talked for sometime trying to make me send him a pic with my shirt off i sent one but i had my bra on After that a girl from skool txt me sayin omg rememer that guy from the party he asked me out.
Some1 I worked with and thought was my friend added my bf on facebook and started flirting with him. She did this for 2 months straight while my bf and I were still together. When we finally broke up she showed me all their messages. i hate them both
In 5th grade, 1 of my guy friends got really mad at me b/c he heard a rumor. Ever since then he has been calling me names and going out of his way to hurt my feelings. Even after he found out that the rumor wasn't true, he still tries to hurt me.
Im am now in the 10th grade. I hate myself i dont harm myself but in a way i do. I am so fake everyone thinks im this happy go lucky person when inside im hurting like never before. Im so stressed my hair comes out i lie and im tired of it. :/
So, I'm bi-sexual. It seems like nobody can understand that, besides my girlfriend. My parents tell me it'll get me to go to hell, that I'm useless and full of ****. My self-esteem has gone down a lot and I want them to accept me for who I REALLY am.
I sent a guy I was talking to a few pictures of myself even though I knew it wasn't the best idea. Then my best guy friend told me that we couldn't talk anymore because I had turned into a '***' /:
in the sixth grade a boy always made fun of my weight. i thought my only way out was to be skinny so i ended up becoming bulimic. I was bulimic off and on for 5 years and never saw myself as pretty. I still think about doing it again...idk what to do
Through highschool, i picked on, pushed around, and bullied people not caring. somehow through my life, i've managed to push away everyone i love and idk why. inside i'm completely broken and feel there's no help for me..
Ive been having this problem ever since i dumped my ex which was over a year ago already,& well now he has someone new,who keeps tashing me on the internet saying im trying to be like her,but im in a serious relationship now,&she wont leave me alone.
one time I called a very good friend of mine a **** because she was a cheerleader.  I honestly didn't mean it, and we fought and still are fighting, but recently I found out her dad died, and I can't forgive myself for what i said. 
"Hi well, Im bi, but I'm being made fun of for it at home & at school. My brothers are mean about it, they ask me if I've done and girls latley. @ school I used to be ""popular"" but now Im called extremley rude names. Some would laugh...please dont :("
"after my 8th grade year.i had gotten very close with this guy. he was my ""best friend"" and we shared everything. he asked me to send him nude pics and i kept saying no. but then i finally did.they were sent to every school around. my life has changed"
"I get in fights with my parents every day. My dad often mocks me; and grounds me for almost everything. My brothers think im exxagerating, but they dont ever see what goes on., my dad has choked me ot of anger."
My ex and i broke up a week ago. The other day he told me that he'd get back together w/ me if i sent him a nude. I love him with all my heart and soul and i want to be with him. But if i send him the pic who knows where it will end up. Should i?
it seems like a lot of ppl have problems that can't be dealt with on their own. You all that read this should post more comments. and here's my story: my bf broke up w/ me nd im crushed cuz i just had his baby is what he did over the line?
"i dnt trust guys easily at all cuz ive been hurt so many times. my mom died a little over a year ago & 6months after she died my ex called me sayin ""haha ur mom died"" im tryin2be happy wit my new boyfriend of 2 months but his exs wnt stop harassin me"
if you really knew me, you would know my mom would blame me for when we didnt have any food. she would waste all of her money on drugs and alcohol. she would fail to take me to school. so now i live 5 states away from everything i know
My boyfriend keeps messaging me every single day and night, always wanting to know who I'm with. He messages me so much, I sleep with my phone. He gets very angry when I don't reply. I'm wondering if I should just dump him. Over the line?...maybe...
What is wrong with me? I can't stop texting my boyfriend. I got really scared about him cheating when I read all the stories. It started when my friend made a comment on facebook. I love him. and want to stop texting him constantly. Comment please!!!
"My friends ""joke"" and tell me that if something happened to anyone it would be me. They say that they hate me as a joke and say that they only make fun of me because they know I can take it. They dont get that it does still hurt me."
"My crush of a year told me the only way he would know if we should go out was to have sex. Well after we did that he told me, ""thanks for the ****"". yeah"
If you really knew me, you'd know that Im uncomfortable in my own skin. There isn't a day that goes by where Idon't look in the mirror and constantly find something to criticize, regardless of being called 'hot' or 'pretty'.
if you really knew me you would know that even though i love my daughter, i regret having sex at 16. i made the mistake of having sex, but i wouldnt give back my daughter for anything. i was teased and called a **** all throughout my sophmore year. 
I sent many naked pics to a guy I liked at school while with my boyfriend. He would tell me things that made me feel good about mself so I would send them. I now know he did this to several girls..this makes me feel like a *****...
I jus dont know how 2 say no when the guy Im with always asks me to send sexy pics to him. I always make up excuses such as I cant im with my mom. I dont want to seem like i don' like him I just want him to stop asking cause I dont like sending them.
"I liked n hooked up for this guy for a year. I finally asked him whats up he told me we might date but he needed to have sex to know. Well of course we did then he told me ""thanks for the **** but i have no interrest in you at all.peace"""
i was14, when i took naked photos of myself that i send to this guy that i trusted and i knew he wonted show anyone.Im at the age of 18 now.My pictures are all over the internet.Its on a **** page too and a porn site.what do i do ?
i sent nude pic to a guy n i regret doin it put it happen n now i got to leave with it...i dont do it anymore n i dont want to but he keeps bothrin me to send him pics n i say lies y i cant...wat shud i do.?
i was trashed online by people at my school and some people did it anonamously and others told me to my face that they were kidding but i know they werent. they called me a lot of things and now im hated by most of the kids in my grade.
During Middle School my mom kept me away from any girl that I hung out with, this has led to me being bad at talking to girls in High School. Since I can't hold down a girlfriend I feel a little lonely sometimes. Was she over the line? I think so.
i had my gf tell me i couldnt hang with my bf b/c she was a girl well on facebook she wrote had fun with my friends now time to hang with some guy named *** and to me that just ****** me not that she did that its she told me i coulnt but she did it.
if you really knew me you would know that i grew up without a dad and if you really knew me you would also know that im not really a mean person im mean because i dont want to show my true feelings and that i get called ugly everyday at school.
I hate it when people leave nasty comments about me on my Formspring. Although I just ignore them and I don't reply back saying something dumb or mean, it still hurts me just to read them. I'm actually a quiet person and don't talk to many people.
One day, my best friend decided to randomly hate me. So she got our entire group of friends against me. They strtd txting me, calling me names nd just being horrible to me. They evn posted things about me online. I fell into a deeper depression...
if u really knew me u would know tht im not the person u think i am.i get called a *********,i get judged by people ive never met or even heard of,but theyve heard of me.&if u really knew me,ud kno i jst made mistakes.&id take it all bak if i cud.
if u really knew me,ud know all i want is to change the past.take bak my mistakes.nd go back to a time where my parents trusted me,ppl liked me,&i wasnt the school whore.id do anything to go back to the good years.i ruined my life&rep.so wsnt worthit
if u really knew me ud know i hold it all in,but i cry myself to sleep every night cause of whats become of my life.trust&luv is something that doesnt apply nd i just want people to see me for who i am not what they hear.
&if u really REALLY knew me,ud know on several occasions, i was ready to take my own life because this one didnt seem worth living anymore.i just want to take back my mistakees and get my life back because this is not what my life was supposed to be.
my family makes fun of me all the time. they just don't get the fact that i am a intelligent person. it hurts me inside. i have a super low confidence at home and school. the only place i feel safe is at cross country practice with my friends.
my boyfriend keeps constant tabs on me asking my friends and sometimes my family who im with or what my plans are for the day and night i think he is just being protective but could it be dangerous
i like this guy ***. hes my bestfriend. i think he likes me but i dont know. we text alot. my friend saiid i should send him a few um pictures. but i dont want to and even she kepts makes fun of me cause im not. help please. 
If you really knew me, you'd know I bottle everythign up. It becomes too much sometimes, so I would just skip school and cry, all day. If you really knew me, you'd know I'm not happy like I pretend to be. You'd know that I missed my ex-friend. 
 my bestfriend and i are in love & have been messing around without anyone knowing about it , but hes been in a relationship with his girl for 5 years...
one of my friends DAD started textin me the other day telling me how he always thought i was sexy, hot, beautiful&very exceptional for my age. he told me later he was jokin but he did it another time do you think him joking bout it is over the line?
My boyfriend is very intent on trying to make me have sex with him, but I don't want to yet. My friends warn me that as soon as I do, he's going to leave for some other girl. I don't want him to go, but I don't want to hurt his feelings either...
if you really knew me you wuld kno i lost three family members this year and my best friend i cry every nite but all my friends and family jus keep tellinq me to qet over it and it hurts cause i feel alone and like nobody understands i hate it ......
this guy was stoking me one day then he was my freind then my boyfriend then he ask me to have sex or he will ell the whole school that i had sex with every boy so i did it with him and then when we where done he left me then 3 years later i saw him.
"i went to a skool from 7-8th grade and i was accepted into honors, and most of the kids were mean sayin ""nobody likes u"" ""shut up, get the **** out of here"" and once i switched skools, my friend told me that they were saying i should kill myself"
I was at my friends house and i meet her brothers friend. So we went out, I thought i loved hem that night. So he asked me to have sex and i said yes. Then a few days later he broke up with me over the computer. But he was really cheating one me.
During my freshman year this one guy started talking to me. He started asking me for naked pictures, I thought it was normal so I sent one thinking he would delete it he ended up sending it to everyone in the school. To this day it still haunts me
I am so scared of going back to school. I was bullied all throughout middle school and now that I am going to high school I am scared that it will escalate to cyber bullying and nasty comments will end up on myspace facebook and twitter. Please help!
i used to date this guy.we broke up but we r still really close.Recently he has asked me to have sex with him.he claims that it will make us closer but i know that we would never be more then this.i dont want to loose him but i dont want to have sex.
I made a blog so I could vent out all of my feelings. I only sent it to friends so that they could read what I had to say. Well two mean girls got to it and decided to write offensive comments. Now I have no blog and no self esteem.
I really liked pat but he was just using me to hook up so i wanted to  forget about him so i told my bff this. she thinks pat is a ***** but she started talking to him and now fwds me the flirtatious texts between them. should i be bad at her?

I lost my best friend because she started spreading my secrets to everyone in our grade. She sometimes yells stuff about me while walking behind me at school. And now she's talking bad about me on facebook. It keeps getting worse and worse. 
If you were really knew me you'd know i feel so alone. I get affection from guys to fill that void and end up having meaningless sex with them. I say i like it no strings attatched but really i just want there infection,to feel wanted and worthy.
Ppl say that words cant hurt ppl, and they dont know that for sure, cuz word (& sounds) do hurt ppl, everytime i walk past the popular group the call me fat, and make pig noises at me. & there is really nothing i can do about it. what should i do?
I lost my best friend because she started spreading my secrets around to everyone in our grade. She somtimes yells it out in hallways and has started posting mean stuff on facebook. And I blocked her, but she still says it. It keeps getting worse.
My ex was very controlling, and jealous. I found out later on he was cheating on me, and when I confronted him he dumped me through Myspace comment! He then told all our friends I was obsessive, stalking him, and threatening his life. -_-
"I'm sick of people calling me ""***."" it's the most offensive thing i've ever heard. I've been teased all my life for being gay and just, ""came out"" over Facebook a few days ago. I feel like crying when i hear that word. "
"i used to be one of the popular girls at school, i had a lot of friends. one day, all of them turned against me even my bestfriend. now im considered a ""loner"". and everyone talks about me all over the interent. i just dont know what to do."
i dated him 4 days and suddenly im the love of his life?i took him 2 a party n he wouldnt let go of me n got mad bc i talked to a friend. if i went to the bathroom he thought i was cheating, n he followed me evrywhere, n got mad bc i wouldnt have sex
"i got asked to send naked pictures to my friends, and i did. and he showed his friends accidently. i want to say no. but i just cant. i feel bad cause he always says ""you will if you love me"".. is that right to do?"
people constantly spread rumors about me and say things like that im a ****.but in all reality i have had only long term relationships all my life.
"I'm constantly worrying over my appearance. I've always been large my whole life. I spend alot of my time looking for special diets and exersizes to be skinnier. I can hear other people's comments reguarding me ""being fat"" and it controls my life. "
If you really knew me you would know that I get judged by parents, people at school, people that dont know meWould also know that some of the people who pick on me still live in the past my parents sometimes yell at me for not doing something perfect
I have a new boyfriend and im over it now....  but i figured id write something to show girls to NEVER trust guys even if they think they love them more then anything.. really dont trust anybody but yourself.. my bf of 2 years had sex with my sister.
"I sent half naked pictures 2 a guy I wanted 2 like me, I never showed my face, & I was NEVER completely naked, but the other day we were talking & he was all ""Yeah I got really mad @ u, & I almost told u that I was going 2 send ur pictures 2 ppl."" "
There are a group of girls at school that have been making fun of me.I have been staying in my room most of the time because i am afraid that the things they say about me are true. everyday when i look at myself all i can think is how ugly i look
i walk into school every morning and no one talks to me ever,sometimes i don't have conversations with anyone  all day.Some ppl call me names like neerd even when they know i can here them.
The night my ex bf and i started dating, he kept pressuring me to send him nude pictures. I kept saying no, and he started yelling at me threatening to dump me. We fought about it for over 2 and a half HOURS. Acceptable? Not at all. /:
I have trust issues because everybody I love leaves my life. I put on a smile every single day, to hide how I really feel. I feel so alone, yet I have so many friends. I cry every night because all I do is care about people but get treated like ****.
this guy always tells everybody that i have sex with him when i dont and im not like that and he also told everybody that i showed him my boobs and i never did. it hurts me so much especially when i thought he was my friend. 
surrouned by over 2,000 kids in my High School i can't help but feeling alone. Being called ugly  and nerd almost every single day makes me dread going to school. almost died by hurting myself, i'm almost recovered with the help of therepy 
If you really knew me you would know that my family treats me like a stranger, they talk about me like they don't know i have feelings and i'm sick of it. i feel like they don't even care about me anymore. I feel so alone, my friends won't understand
ive always wanted to be popular but people always call me ugly and my sister doesnt really call me fat but shes always talking about my wait and how i need to go work out and eat less and shes trying to make me just like her but i dont want to be
i thnk i  dont have any felings i play girls alot. i have a gf thas 19 n she loves me but she has a kid n is maryd. she think she cheated on me jus by givn a guy er numba but i dd worse but every1say im special cus i acually care bot the girls i play
"This girl @ my school has been post mean things about my boyfriend, friends, and myself on her tumblr. She is ""in love"" with my boyfriend and has been causing issues for over a year. The things she is saying are rude and unnecessary, what shoud i do?"
I've been ridiculed over facebook, i've been told that i was ugly, n gross, n i made people puke when they seen me.because i broke up with a guy n his friends didnt like me for it, they told me to go kill myself cause i deserve it. Over On or Under??
if u really knew me ull no that i been talked about in every way and imnot even in high school yet ull know that i have issues and bottle up all my feelings and take my anger out on my little brother when he dosent deserve it 
If you really knew me , you'd know that all I want is to be myself but I'm so worried about impressing my mom that I let myself down. My mom is always telling me how to be more like her and less like me and I've lost my self. (i'm adopted, advice)
i was on skype with a guy ive known for years and he asked for me to show me my boobs, i did and i think he took pics but im not sure... over the line??
Today, my ex best friend started a rumor about me and my friend saying that we wanted our ex boyfriend back and that we wanted ot either hear their voice again and get them back of have sex with them.
If you really knew me you'd know that I'm ashamed of the things I've done.I thought that smoking that weed, drinking that beer, and doing things with those guys were things that made me accepted. If you really knew me, you'd know im sad with who i am
Okay so i had sex with this guy i really liked and he liked my back but after that night he ignores me.. i thought he was different. atleast he was the first time we did ****. He hasnt talked to me for a week and i donnt know what to do ):
"My mother told me last night that she hates me and thinks i'm an ungrateful piece of ****. i called my dad to go over there just for the night and he told me no and to stop acting like i'm 4. i feel betrayed by my family; they are all i have anymore."
If you really knew me ,Then you'd know that I loved someone and whould do any thing to keep him interested , it wasnt ok to give pieces of me away and it hurts every time i look at my self, nobody knows what i did, i have to keep it silent.
if you really knew me yu'd know that I'm a overly happy person and I use this as a cover up to hide all my emotions that I can not control.I stress out about the little things, I avoid the bigger things like that I might be gay and my mom has cancer 
"I have to tell this story......I was ridiculed by my classmates and then two girls in my class made a fake ""boy"" and I really thought he was real and he asked me out and I though the liked me and I found out he was fake..and I had no friends then."
i started texting this guy & he asked me for a picture so i did and it was just a picture of my face & then he told me that he wanted a ***** picture so i sent one of me with no shirt.  he told me i was fat and ugly. why can't i be pretty?
my ex txts&calls randomly.ihve his myspce paswrd bt he dosnt kno,he's becme a flirt he hits on every girl.it hurts me 2c tht bcuz im still inlove w/hm.he gives me mixd signals &he's evn askd if we cld b frnds w/benefits idont kno wht 2do im confused 
I had sex with this guy I was with, the week after it happened we couldnt have been closer. After that week he cheated on me twice with different girls and is lying about it...He still acts like he didnt do anything wrong and is ignoring me...

"If you really knew me, you would know that my some of my ""friends"" trash me. Not only do I deal with this, but panic attacks, stress, a dying grandmother, and a father who constantly yells at me.   This isn't what high school is supposed to be like."
i cheated on my boyfriend twice with sending this guy dirty pictures of me,the guy o sent them to was one of his bestfriends,im still with my boyfriend,and the guy i sent the pictures to i never talk to anymore.i just had to let him see my privacy,
if u really knew me ud know my dada left me a couple months ago i havent talke to him in a while he is in the army him and my mom r divocing and me and my sister fight i tell her all the time i hate her but i dont,my bf always wants to sext i dont =(
If you really knew me,You would know that I don't like myself. I can't stand to look at myself. Also, you would know my family is falling apart ever since my uncle was murdered.We don't talk anymore, and everyone ignores each other. It kills me. 
i caught my mom cheating on my dad when i was 12. i called my dad to tell him, but he hung up on me & never talked about it again. i realized i cant do anything bout my mom but what hurts the most is that when i needed my dad the most he wasnt there.
if u really knew me u woukd know that i am going out with a senior and im barley an 8th grader and dont know if i should do things with him i should not do 
if you really knew me, you'd know that  I hate myself. I just look in the mirror and tell myself everything that's wrong with me. I always fthink my family doesn't understand me, They don't get how much my grandma's death affected me when i was 7.
if you really knew me, you'd know that i get cyberbullied everyday just because people think they can take advantage of me,and i act like it doesn't bother me.i've already told my parents and my school,but the kids still aren't in trouble what to do?
"people at my school; constantly make fun of me and people who have known me since pre-k say embarrassing things about me in public that i dont want anyone to know.i have to deal with 2 older brothers who treat me like their property too."
a guy and i went out for two days. I ended the relationship because he said he loveed the first day. Over the next three months, he would text me and say i was a **** and a **** and a ****. He got most of my friends to turn on me. 
there's this guy....hes cool and has a great body but he keeps asking me to send naked pics to him and i just dont trust him with that.....he is also pressuring me into having sex with him but i dont really want to....we arent even dating or anything
every day my family calls me fat.. D: is that over the line? 
he never textes me i always have to text him. he tells me he loves me and has me falling so hard for him, but after he knows that i like him alot he textes and says he wants pics or phone sex. over the line huh??? :(
If you knew me you would know that I'm called pretty by friends and family and 1 stalker all the time but I feel like i'm the ugliest, fattest person in the world. Is it over. I have been asked 4 a photo of me in my underware and i'm 13, Is it over?
i know im not pretty or cute or hot or anything like that, but eventhough im not what guys want ive been asked for nudes, phone sex and sexting :( i regret many things i did but the fact he said goodbye hurt me the most. i feel worthless
before school had ended two of my friends had turn against me and started callin me all kinds of names and would not stop txting me... over the line???

My boyfriend is sleeping over this girls house, we've been going out for 2 years. its like a party and the girl who is throwing the party will be the only girl there, and there wont be any parents. is this crossing the line?
Alot of the boys in my school only get with girls to get action. I feel like that if I don't do all the things that they want me to do, then no boys will like me anymore & alot of boys like me now because I do all that stuff. I don't know what to do.
There is this guy that I have have been talking to for a while.. I know he likes me alot, but only wants sex because he talks about it more than anything. He has been asking me for nude pics but I think I just send some of uinderwear is that over??
i sent a naked pic of me to my boyfriend, but he txted back saying yuck i dont like you... it hurt me so much and he dumped me, i want to report him but im afraid i will be charged... what should i do????
Wen i met this boy it was for my friend I didnt really feel like talkin with anybody but i said ok So long story short we had sex maybe 2 weeks after meeting I found out he messes with other girls in my class and he lies about it he sed i needed help
some called me freak show becuase of my birth defect throw facebook.
"im dating a guy but 2 other guys claim to be ""in love"" with me, ive been dating my boyfriend for 10 months and its long distance.. he cheated on me 8 times and wants me to take him back, im not sure if i can trust him again but i love him alot...."
I sexted 3 different guys. The first two pictures didn't get out anywhere and so i thought that it would be okay to sext again. The 3rd guy i sext forward it to everyone. It gets worse every single day. The rumors are out of control.
Ever since I moved to Tenesse, I've noticed that I rarely see any black people. In my new school, I'm the OINLY African American student and everyone keeps calling me an ugly moor. I understand that Black History doesn't mean anything down here now. 
I went on my first date with *** and it was amazing! He drove me home and we had our first kiss but then he asked to be my boyfriend i said it was to early. He keyed heartbreaker into my car. Ho followed me everywhere until i got a restraining order
my dad and my mom got divorced recently and he already has a new girlfriend. I hate her so much that i put naked pictures of mine in her sock drawer and he found them. over the line?
When my ex gf broke up with me we decided to be friends. However, before that, I wrote her this poem/letter saying that I hoped she was happy now. A few weeks later she photo coppied it and passed it around the school. A low blow? You be the judge.
i have trust issues with my own boyfriend. i feel like he is always talking to other girls and i get jealous really easily. the last time i broke ip with him he threatened to put my nudes on facebook and show my dad. i never feel good enough for him.
i fell in love my freshmen year with a guy, we had been dating on and off for 2 and half years  and he constantly asked for naked pics of me finally i gave in , it turns out he showed all his friends now he wont even talk to me 
my boyfriend of three days asks me to marry him and say he's in love with me. This is over the line? should i end it now?
Everyday I look in the mirror and i dont like what i see.Ever sense I decided to have sex with a boy i loved very much. We're still together but the problem is he told his best friend who he thought he could trust Now the whole school calls me a ***!
"My brother, dad, and some boys make fun of me for how i look, Im 5'4"" and 132lbs, they call me fat. I wont even go swimming anymore. Its horrible."
if u really knew me u would know tht i have no true friends. i only have  god and my family. everytime i try to hang out with my friends i get judged by the boys that likes my friends. i get bashed on like a dog. 
For the past few months me and this guy have been on and off... He's a cheater... But he is so amazing and so sexy that everytime he wants me back... I take him back... Is it over the line that no matter what he does I take him back? :( 
Im been with my bf for 4 months, sometimes i feel liek im in prison, im not allowed to talk to any guys, and if i do, he will break up with me. he has no reason not to trust me, and i allow him to talk to girls, Is he crossing the line?
Found this guy on myspace that i went 2 school. We started textin, & became friends again. He asked for pictures. I sent a pic of my face. He wanted more, so i sent pics with my bra on. He wanted more, i sent one without a bra. We never texted again.
my brother got my myspace password and sent everyone a message that iwanted to have sex with them i got only 1 friend now and i think he should confess he wont even apoligize did he go over the line i ridiculed every day and im depressed badly
i liked this guy, he found out, he told everyone on facebook and rejected me and then his friend wrote all this rude stuff about me and so did he. i had to leave school. i have to go back now and i dont know how to deal with all of that.
These two boys at school dont like me for no reason at all. they started messaging on fb and textong me things like, ur a **** and why is your forehead so big? it really hurts because i don't understand why theyre so mean to me when im nice to them.
ive loved this boy for a year now but he flirts with so many girls. ive showed him my body, naked. and he liked it. told me he loved me. yet he says that we cant be together. ive gave him too much and now he just ignores me?
my bf looks through my phone, when i ask for it he wont give me it. So I started to ask for his phone when he takes mine, he will give it to me but his hand is on the phone the whole time and he is always looking over my sholder. What should I do?
i was firends wit this guy n he liked me and wanted me 2 do things wit him. i had a bf so i was uncomfortable. i broke up wit my bf cuz i wanted 2 c how things would go wit tht guy, but he only wanted sex form me. i told him no and he lost it.
i lost my virginity 2 a guy who was 21. ever since then ive regretted it so much! he never talked to me again after tht. then i find out tht he was told by my then bf to take me away from him and get rid of me for him cuz he couldnt break up with me.
Recently, I have been involved with a boy from a couple towns over. He always asks me to get naked on video chat, so the other night I just took off my top. I didnt know at the time, but he took a picture on his computer and I'm now scared.

I used to talk on online chatting room and meet guys, if i got comfortable talking to them i would give them my number and start texting them flirting and sexuall messages and sometimes it would get out of control and then they ask for the nude pics.
On Facebook, I typed something wrong on one of my statuses and these two girls started attacking me like pitbulls and messaged everyone how much of a ****** I was and and how stupid I am. They crossed the line.
I was sitting at home one day when i received a text message.It turned out to be a picture of this girl i go to school with and she got drunk and her first boyfriend ever took nude pics of her it was horrible.he was the one to take her clothes off.
now i understnad how bad sexting is. its very bad. i've only sent one pic like that and it turns out he showed it to his bestfriend. Now he lives in another state and who knows how many people have seen that pic in that other state. i feel very dumb.

"I meet this guy over in Internet and he gave me his number we start talking and that question pops up"" Can i see a naked pic of you?."" I thought that me and him were in love and i did it, he said if you love me you will do it? Was that over the line?"

i stared  going out with this guy and this girl who liked him got angry she started telling her friends that i was a backstabbing slut. and  told my bf lies,the girl who started all of this even told me she had dreams of me dying..
If you really knew me you would know, my dad told me when i was 7 years old that he wished i would die so he could stop paying my medical bills. if you really knew me you would know that i was kicked out of my house at age 12. if you really knew me.
"Last summer i was emailing a girl, who i thought was my friend, she started saying **** about me ""you're so ugly! and so ******* fat! U COW!!!! u should go die in a hole! if itz big enough!!!"" then she said i thought it was funny! i was just jk-ing!"""

Boyfriend of over a year is completely obsessive in everyway possible, but sweet and we're in love. Amazing potential, but an alcoholic. What's going on? There's no breaking up with, he's an angry persuassive person. He stalks, lurks, listens, snoops
I sent a guy some naughty text messages/pictures once, and everyone in the school ended up finding out. We took a field trip and the teachers ended up talking about MY pictures. It hurt me so bad. It isnt worth it, trust me.
i did the most stupidest thing ever in my life. i sent a pic of me in my bra to a guy and he sent it to ever other guy and then the pic got out so its all around my high. i feel like i cant do anything about it anymore school feels like hell to me.
I sext with guys almost every day, then afterwards i feel like a ****. But  it just seems to happen? Idk how it just does, they talk me into it. They beg and beg and beg but then i finally cave in :/

i have a boyfriend and we've been together for 3 years and he still makes ita big deal if i text my friends that are guys, but shouldn't he know by now that i'm with him and i don't want anyone else?
A little over 2 years ago, my now ex-boyfriend made me go through my entire E-mail, in and out box, and any website with messaging to prove I was cheating on him. He never found anything, but he still wasn't satisfied.
Some friends' bfs might be controling,but not my friend.SHE is the one controling.She thinks that he has to be with her every single minute of every week of everyday.She also says things about who he's hanging out with.I just hope she realizes it...
My ex-boyfriend used to text me ALL the time. He would even text me if we were in the same room together. He'd get angry if I didn't respond back immediately so he'd resend the text and follow up with 2 or 3 texts asking what was going on. 
I sext this guy who 'promised' he wouldnt show anyone but ended up sending it to 6 of his friends. Each one sent it to all of their phone contacts. The bullying got so bad at school I had to switch school - I am still harassed to this day. Dont sext.

I wake up every day and wonder if my life is worth living. I have imagined what people would think if i would commit suicide.The only thing that keeps me going is my friends. But there is a problem, my parents really don't like my friends!
I worked for an online cam site for a while. Some guy I knew found me on there and took a bunch of different screen shots with me topless.  After refusing to send him nudes of myself he found my myspace and sent all the pictures to my friend's list.
"This dude from school calls me all the time wanting me to have phone sex with him. Everytime I say no, he always says things like, ""You know I love you and I think you are so cool."" He says stuff like that over and over again until I say yes."
My own father told everybody a *** story abt me tht I'm a *****, sex-addict, and too many to name it. He even told my friends about that and they ended up hate me. I tried to tell them that it isnt true but they aren't sure who is tellin the truth..

My boyfriend thinks he can control my life. he tells me who to talk to what to wear and yells at me evrytime i do something wrong. Last night after a while he let me go through his fone. i found that he was cheating. Everyone tell me to leave him...
This guy in our school keeps talking to girls from other towns, somehow he always gets their nudes. Until one they the principal took his phone and now he is registered as a sexual offender. 
This guy i dated for 3 years turned out bad and ended up stalking me i had to change my number 4 times, block him from emails, he would create a new email. he's stopped for a long time..but tonight he messaged me. What should i do?
My boyfriend of 1 year, 6 months just broke up with me. Everyone is saying its my fault because I'm fat, ugly, not good enough. But he's saying different. And he said he just wants to work on things. But now I feel worthless because of those people.
im a girl, and each day of my life i deal with drama. i get called names everyday such as fat, ****, ****, ****, ****, nasty and many more. this has been going on for a little over a year now. they even started doing it on my facebook. 
I had a football player update his facebook status about me, and how I can go shut the **** up because I updated my status to support the band and not the football team. The school isn't doing anything about it and the entire school is bullying me.

Im a guy 15 and when wever i get in a relationship i always ask for topless or full shot photos of them naked in the first 2 or 3 weeks is that bad?

"so one night one of my so called friends posted a picture of me on Facebook,it was embarassing (nothing bad) so i asked to take it down,they didnt. So i texted them and they went off on me calling me ""fat"" ""ugly"" some friends they are........"
i feel like no one cares for me and i want to sneak out to see my guy friend but im afraid too. people have said im ugly, fat, worthless, ****,slut,**** and alot of ither things
My ex-best mate texted her boyfriend of two days a picture of her topless. When it got sent round all his mates, she pretended that I'd taken the picture and sent it around so she wouldn't get into any trouble for sending the picture.
My ex best friend was having a hard time so I let her stay with my family for a while last year... she was rude to my parents all week and I found out from mutual friends she'd been ******** about me online about it, after we took her in.
I'm scared that the naked pictures I sent to my ex-boyfreind will appear again, on everybodys phone ...
"I once posted my favorite song lyrics onto my blog, and a girl who hated me re-posted them on her own journal changing the lyrics to make them all about how ""fat"" I was.  I can't listen to the song anymore without feeling terrible about myself."
"i know a girl who went from the most outgoing and nicest person to someone so depressed and lifeless because of people ""anonymously"" calling her name of Formspring. it breaks my heart to see someone feel all alone just because of harrasing websites."
"I sent out a mass txt with a picture of my enemy with words like **** written on his face and a sound saying ""they're all gonna laugh at you and plug it up"" from Carrie. Oh and I call him ""it"" and ****"
I once found an enemies facebook and messaged all her friends HORRIBLE things about her that I knew. What the **** was I thinking?
"My cousin creates fake Facebook and myspaces with my picture. He writes horrible things like "" I deal drugs"" "" I'm a ****"" and other things that look bad. I have never done anything to him! "
I loved him. He stole from my family and lied about it through text msgs and on the phone. He lied to the cops. Now I can't face my family anymore because I didn't go in for the interview with the cop. I feel bad but I have anxiety and couldnt deal. 
Im in private and just transfered from public school some one spread a rumor that i have herpes and everyone stays away from me even the kindergarten and when i do talk to me they always stare at me like im disgusting is this over the line??

In January one of my friends stole my phone. They found a dirty video of me and told a lot of people about it. Being gay is hard and they all wanted to see it. They took my phone during school and sent it to themselves, bringing it to the principal.
Everyday at school I'm teased for my sexuality.  I am bisexual.  Not even bisexual, I'm never dated the same sex, I just have crushes on a few same sex people.  So I can't or wouldn't even call myself bisexual.  Everyday I'm called the devil
"I told my ""best friend"" who I thought I could trust, that me and my boyfriend had sex. She started a rumor that I was pregnant. My boyfriend heard it and broke up with me. She said she didn't start it but she's the only person who would've known. :("

I'm almost thirty years old and I still have issues with adversity. I am a professed lesbian andI have children. I can't count how many times I've been called seriously derogatory names because of my sexuality. This is what we teach our kids..its sad
" Every guy i like seems to ask for the same thing. My boyfriend knows im saving sex for marriage and he respects that, but he gets so mad at me for not sending him dirty pictures when ""we've been close for this long how can I not trust him"" wow?"

me and my bf have been dating for a while and he always wants me to do dirty things and he wants to go all the way, and i dont know how to tell him no because i dont want him to dump me and everyone tells me he uses and plays girls what do i do?
Ohkay my boyfriend Santiis always awkward controlling and is always like where are you at baby, what are you doing who are you with, why are you with them, and just things like that, and sometimes it kinda scares me. do you have any advice? thankss 
I sent 4 guys naked pictures and it finally caught up to me. There was a fwd started about it at school, and a lot of people recieved it, but ever since my 1st pic was sent ive become addicted to doing it, and for some reason im not regretting it....
back in freshman year...  a friend ended up taking pictures of me..topless even though my hair was covering me i was still topless.. put them online and campus..im 19 now and still have selfesteem issues ive always been bullied in person or online.
im in middle school (8th grade) and theres about 4 girls who cant stand me, nobody else has a problem with me that i know of but these girls make fun of me on facebook, myspace and anywhere they can find me on. they even txt me mean messages..
all these older guys always ask me for nude pictures and they say its harmless but i know its not, my bff got caught many times sexting and got introuble.. if you sext does it make you a ****?/
I started sending some explicit pictures when i was 15.i guess it was becus i had low self esteem and i thought that the more good comments about my body i got it would make me feel better..it didnt.i feel guilty about it every day. but i cant stop..
I liked a guy and thought he might of liked me too. Then he started chatting with me constantly. It started out casual but then he started saying things that made me very uncomfortable. just really sexual, perverted things... and I barely knew him...
I got this girl pregnant. I cheated on her and got her friend pregnant too. I dont know what to do? someone help!
My friend let her boyfriend control her life. He told her who she could and couldn't talk to. He destroyed her self esteem. He sent her nudes out to everyone, including her parents. He cheated on her, lied to her, and she still wants to be with him.
I had sex for the first time, and the guy lied to me and said he loved me. Now it's all over the school. Why is it when guys have sex, everyone approves and tells him good job. But when a girl has sex, everyone thinks she is a slut?
"Some boys at school started making fun of me for my body in the 4th Grade. I'm now known as ""The fat lesbian"", and i'm not even gay. Then the harrasment spread online and in text. I tell the principlal and she only gives them warnings. HELP"
ok so i been in love with this guy and we had a thing last summer but we only made out but the thing is he wants more that that and idk what to do he flirts with every girl and he cheats and he wants to have sex what do i do? do i say yes? 
so me and this kid have been dating for two years now and he wants ro have sex with me but im only 15. and he told me if i rele love him i will do it but i want to stay oure. what should i do?
I hooked up with a guy last year. Afterward, he would pressure me to send nude photos of myself. At one point he told me to send him 25 photos in one night. Now he has a girlfriend and still tries to get me to hook up with him.
My facebook and email account got hacked. Someone posted my nudes on my FB for the world to see.. Including my parents. I haven't been on FB ever since. It's been 9 months, but its still hard. There. I said it. 
i have a friend.he has nude videos & photos of his ex.he really wants her to be with him so he uses them against her.she snaps and tells the cops they searched his phone he had nothin.i no he hide them.he trys to use them against her. what do i do 
theres this girl who hacked my facebook with my ex and harassed me and my family by saying how he **** me all the time becauae i wanted to get pregnant but it was a total lie. he just didnt like the fact we broke up. whhats reccommended to do?
my friend and I were in a fight so she started calling me a **** and since im asian she called me a ****. she felt bad and said sorry but i didnt take it. so she started texting me very bad things and still wont stop. 
I know someone online who keeps threatening suicide. I had to stay up with him countless nights because he claimed to have a knife by his keyboard. I feel so helpless from this, what do I do?
I was on omegle just to chat until I met this cute guy. I showed my bra and panties and my face was visble. He said if you disconnect I'll post this. And the clip of me came on the screen. I disconnected  immediately. I'm really ashamed and scared.:/
my boyfriend makes me feel ugly and like fat. i wear size 8 jeans and size medium shirts. i feel like he just wants me to. be as tiny as his exes. he expects me to change my ways all the time. but he never does anything for me. what should i do? i
So.. there's this girl I completely hate. She used to fool around with my boyfriend, you know, before we were dating, and it bothers me to no end. So.. I spread rumors about how he told me her **** stunk (which he did say) to the whole school.
"When I was a freshman in high school, I got staph infection. It was all over the news and the whole school knew. Some girls made a myspace under my name and posted things like ""I'm a nasty ****"" and ""I have no friends"". I had to switch schools!"
"My boyfriend get harassed daily by one specific person. Asking him if he's ""going to come out of the closet today?"" or just flat out calling him a homo. He's not gay. The bully also gives him **** about still being a virgin. We chose to wait. x/"
My mom's boyfriend has all of her passwords and spys on her inbox. I told her about all of the consequences and so far it hasn't helped. Is this normal?
i really like this guy, hes always texting me askiing for nudes, and i give in because i want him to like me.. i feel trapped, and he can be a real ouche, yet i still find myself madly attracted to him! help!?
this guy I like only talks about sex , with me and I never had sex or anything :/ and he says he loves me and all but It doesnt seem like it. When we talk its only about that. And everyone says his just trying to get in my pants):
I was helping a friend with her boyfriend problems and then a month later she turns her back on me, and tells her bf to cuss me out of fb, so I blocked them but yet she couldn't get over it and keeps sending me messages on my fb for no reason.
My friend asked me for a picture of me naked. then i sent him one. a week later, a few other people had it. the next day, my whole school.. and my mom. i am now the school **** and i can never get my reputaion back. i wish i could take it  just back
I am an active member of my church group, I consider them my family and my supporting foundation. Not to long ago I recieved a formspring message that threatened me that if I go near church I will regret it. What should I do? I thought I was safe.
All the kids in my school call me an Emo, or Cutter. I don't appreciate it. I'm take anti-depression pills because of them. And I'm thirteen. And I feel pathetic for taking them. 
My boyfriend always flirts with my bestfriend. He asked her to sext him and he sent her a naked picture of him. Now hes telling everyone hes had sex with her, i dont know what to do! My best guy friend says to dump him? What should i do
My boyfriend wants me back after he has dumped me three times for another girl. He had sex with one, made out with my bff and sent 5 naked pics of him to another. Now hes blackmailing me if i wont take him back!
I sent a bad picture to this guy an now he wants more of something else an I'm already in trouble about the first one but he said if I don't send him that other one he's gonna send my picture to everybody!!
I was pressured a lot to send pictures of myself. I did and it was one of the biggest mistakes ever. So don't do. No matter what. He or she is telling you have too just for them to love you. Don't! They are not worth it.
I sent some not nice pictures to my x/bf... it was a HUGE mistake and the word quickly going around and people are adding their own twist to the story! ughh im mad at myself for doing it, i felt pressered into the situation. HELPPPP!
theres this guy at skool and all he does is call me names and make fun of me. sometimes i come home crying. he even gets his frends to do it too. even one of my so called guy frend joins in 
there's this gurl that is bullying me because i accidently kicked my frend n now she calls me a ***** or a ******* or something 2 get me rlly upset,  then she tired 2 shake up an izzie n put it in my locker n say it wuz from my best frend :(
This boy at my school is very disrespectful he makes fun Of my acne he called me fat he made fun of my droopy eye  and it's getting to the point to when I really want to do something about it but if I do every thing will get worse
Me n my bf pretty much jus have sex everday and dnt do nything n we never talk as much, and wen i try n talk bout my feelings he gets mad. And he never even likes to tell me why hes wl me or loves me. 
My best friend is at her friends house and everytime they call me they hang up and my best friend decides to stop talking to me for her boyfriend. And they said I can come over today and then said they were kidding and hung up. Too much?
 my cousin and I snuck out to go see these guys. She has a boyfriend, but te guy she met up with starting feeling her up, and everything. This guy wasn't her boyfriend, either... I found out it was MY boyfriend. I was half asleep.. Help?
There's this girl in my school who calls me fat and talks trash about me and I never talked to her ever in my life. Is this over the line?
I feel that my boyfriend of almost a year dont even care that i cry every time he says some hurtful thing to me like ***** and more should i still stay with him or leave
my ex sent me a picture of his **** and he had posted it everywhere and left mean comments on his photoos of it, and then reported me for taking the pic and putting it everwhere and sending it to everyone. after that my parents kinda hated me.
Someone i thought was a friend hurt my feelings. she made my heart hurt because of some comments she was making. i am now seeking help to fight my obesity problems. Megan, you were mean to say those things. :'(
I had sexted my girlfriend and she sent the picture to everyone in the school teased me and said mine was reallly small. 
sometimes my friends will joke around about me being stupid and fat, but i dont always take it as a joke. i think they dont really mean any harm, but it still hurts. it's hard to know if they're being truthful or not when they say those things to me.
so this one girl felt the need to accuse me of messaging her boyfriend that I didn't even know then she continued to call me wet back and say i'm greasy to go back to my own country. I am puerto rican and italian... racist???
A guy sent a naked picture of me to the whole school including the principal and my parents then everyone who got it sent it their phonebooks which resulted in about 300 plus people having my naked body on their phones.

We started going out and so much fights and arguments came along. we ended up braking up and so the friendship ended too. You told me you wish I'd die when that car hit me, that remark hurt me a lot, I could never be friends with you again.
"I used to have a formspring. I have short hair and I'm often mistaken for a lesbian. People harassed me and said things like ""has anyone ever told you you look Ellen degeneres"" and ""you're a *****"". I  felt like ****."
i have a friend who's bisexual and he's becoming controlling now bc he wants me to tell my best friend since 8th grade that im bisexual too or he's going to personally tell her & now he won't even let me talk to my ex should i end my friendshipw/him?
im hooking up with this guy who is the same age as me. he keeps telling me to send pictures of me in my bra, or my private areas to him. i strongly insisted that he stop asking me to send him pictures of me that suggestes nudity or sex. 
this one girl concvinced everyone to turn against me. these girls told me i could kill myself and no one would care. i walked down the halls getting called bad words, had fb hate pages and read mean fb posts and formsprings about me. school is hell!

I've been dating this guy for a while and he would always me get him to send him naked pictures and I use to give into it. I feel horrible because I want to break up with him but I still know that he has all those pics still. Never make that mistake.

My friend who is 13 has an 18 year old boyfriend. They have had sex. I've tried to convince her to break up with him, but she yelled at me.
This guy I'm friends with is 17 and I'm 14. We've never had a sexual relationship at all, just friends, he has a gf. But recently he always asks for nude pics and stuff. I always tell him no, but I feel like it's my fault because we did mess around..
I've had this bf for almost 2 yrs. We broke up when he cheated twice once with my bff. He came back to me 2 months latr it was good until he made me loose everything.I give him everything,but he's always angry

im a freshman in highschool, & this one kid hates me so much that he does whatever he can to make my life hell, tells people that i talk behind their backs & gets his older brother & his friends to scare me cause he wont do it himself.
im 16 years old and live in Minnesota, i have an ex boyfriend who lives in texas but yet he still is callinga nd texting 24/7 always accusing me of things saying i dont please him and that i should be there for him more i feel nothing i do is right. 
my boyfriend made me delete all my social networking pages becos he sed i was exposing myself... i think it was **** cos all i had up was about me and him and my facebook was all family. he wont allow me on thse without threatenin our relationship.
last year i dated this guy who was  3 yrs older than me. He kept askin for sex.i told him no. all my friends think we had sex. were callin me 14 and preggo. we broke up. evry time i meet a guy, they alwys tell him tht i had a kid w/ my older ex.
I asked a guy to stay off my facebook profile because all he ever did was insult me and make me feel like ****. He called me a liberal rejected dyke. He knows i'm gay and have lost a lot of friends because of it. :'(
After I had split up with my boyfriend for 10 months, he called me and told me an explicit video that I had sent him wound up on facebook. A handful of my friends saw it and I was in shambles. To this day I am always cautious about what I send.
okay so my firend takes my other firends phone and texts his gf say wanna suck my ****. Then the girl breaks up with my firend and he really loves her and i dont know wat to do
One of my sorority sisters spread rumors around calling me a ****, a slut, and a *****, and kept sending me texts and facebook messages telling me that she wanted me to kill myself.
"latley middle school have been starting "" burn pages "" mostly on facebook, posting pictures of ppl they dont like and trash talking them it hurts to see my friends are there & ppl say there ***** and ******, "
I went out with this girl for 2 mths we broke up for a while&were both planning on gettin back together.When we started hanging out again i brought my bestfriend wit me. they had sex behind my back&he gave her HPV and her body wont take the vaccine.
I was cyber bullied by this girl,I told her to stop or else it would come back around.Her brother died.She didn't care,She continued to gather up her friends and torment me saying to go die, go kill myself, go cut yourself emo kid. No one likes you.
"In seventh grade, one of my guy friends that id liked since elementary school had been asking me to send him topless pictures. I'd refused for a few weeks and then he'd said to me ""thats a shame. was just starting to like you"" So stupidly i sent them"
In November, on Formspring, I received several messages calling out my insecurities and telling me to kill myself. I can honestly say that Justin Bieber's song Never Say Never stopped me from cutting and helped me realize the messages meant nothing.
I don't know what to do anymore. This boy i've been with for so long treats me terrible. I love him so much. He was my first. I don't want to let go. I love him so much but he doesnt stop. What do I do. He's cheated on me and everything. 
These 2 girls bullied me saying im a fat ugly b**** and no one likes me and to switch schools they did that 3 times it sucks and i hate them !! :'(
"My ex came up with a word, ""blackafied"", and called me that. I told him it was racist and please stop but he wouldn't. He sent me that word 750 times via FB after we broke up just to make me cry and he knows I have part-black family that I don't see."
Well i liked this kid, when i was in 7 grade and he always text all the time, well he asked me to send him pics. I said no..well after i said no he never texted me back. But the same week my best friend comes up to me and told me she sent pics to him
I was in a relationship with this guy for over a year he started sending me emails,and IM's when i didn't answer his calls calling me names and putting me down emotionally and mentally. So i told him it was over and changed my number and deleted him.
i have a friend who is going to school to be a police officer and he asks me for naked photos ALL the time. Everytime he asks I tell him how disgusting he is and how degrading he is to women.
"I would get phone calls from these girls saying, ""Hey, are you pregnant?. Cause you look like you are."" And other phone calls saying, ""You look like your pregnant."" Even though they stopped calling, it still hurts to think about it. :("

There used to be someone from my school that stalked me. Everyday after my bus ride home they would call me private & say that they knew what i was wearing ,where i lived & stuff like that but they finally stopped. I was so scared
"My friends would all right all over my friends wall that he was ""worthless"" or that he should go get a life. It was hard to tell if they were joking or not. I had to explain that they were joking. I didn't find it as funny as they did :/"
I know a girl who in third grade we used to make fun of her. It wasn't all that bad and we made up and became friends. Then I have friends who made fun of her online! They didn't even talk to her in person about it after the fact. 
My friend keeps messaging me mean stories and rumors about people. I know that she is making fun of other people. But she is my friend and I don't want to sound rude
I keep getting messages from friends calling me a ***** but I didn't do anything. Any time I try to ask why they are saying that they just reply with *****. It is kinda upsetting
