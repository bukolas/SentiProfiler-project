There are two types of fall guys; one who willingly accepts responsibility for something he didn't do, to cover for those that did. And then, there's the other, who gets blame for it, because the one who actually did it, doesn't want to be held responsible for it. Either way, someone at the end is left holding the bag while the bad guy gets away.

Truth of the matter is, fall guys can be found in all walks of life. In the corporate world, in the politics of Washington, in the world of espionage, love triangles and even mostly in the world of organized crime.

Sometimes fall guys are not just about one, but about many. Thatâ€™s because in this so-called fault game, the notion becomes many and the more the many, the more confusing. The more confusing, the more difficult it becomes to find the truth. Who to blame and who to be held accounted for.

 We live in a world of good versus evil. The fall guy is made out to be evil. When reality tell us that evil doesn't really exist. Because good prevails all and evil is simply a lack of. Evil becomes our creation. And in the end, its really all about us. Since we are to blame for its existence.

So in the end there is and always will be a fall guy. When the finger is pointed at who? It should always be pointed at us.
