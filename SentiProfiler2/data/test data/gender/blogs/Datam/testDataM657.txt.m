It's been an awesome ride the past 8 years, purely because Shankar has been riding wingman with me through out. The similarities between us are enough to fit in a book sized similar to the Advanced Oxford English Dictionary and i guess that is what has made us such good friends. We live two minutes away from each other, were back benchers throughout our school days, and now study in colleges 4 hours apart. (the last point may seem out of place, but considering the fact that we both are 48 hours from home it makes sense. )
Non stop nonsense this guy can churn out at a moments notice. Has the ability to rip anyone's self respect to threads. I have been on the receiving end more than once and I'M known for my ability to dish it out. Listing out memories and times we've spent together will fill out like a 100 1024 character spaces, so i shall refrain.
Anyway cheers to you dude. Hope you do manage to set all your convoluted plans in motion and someday manage to get somewhere in life
