Alright. In order to finally complete my application, I tried another photo on istockphoto.com. This time it's from the food and beverage category. Which is a wanted category of photographs as described in their tutorial or Photo Training Manual. If that pic doesn't fly, I guess I need new camera equipment. As you probably guessed by now, my approach to istockphoto is this. "Dude, you take thousands and thousands of photos every year, there must be some stock-worthy stuff in there."
