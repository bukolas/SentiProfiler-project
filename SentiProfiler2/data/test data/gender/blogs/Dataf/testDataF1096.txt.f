"Next up, blood-thirsty bunnies Marlo is officially down to two naps. For those of you who do not have children, that first sentence will mean nothing to you. For those of you who do, you probably just experienced an instinctual pain in your chest at the memory of what it means to plan your life around your baby's sleep schedule. Or is that just me? I can't be the only one who has run outside and verbally berated the garbage truck driver for disturbing a nap, THERE GOES THE REST OF MY DAY. Garbage truck diver, snow plower, mail carrier... all have been informed at one time or another of Marlo's sleep schedule. It goes like this: when Marlo's asleep, no one is allowed to breathe. The end.
You don't want that crazy, short-haired Southern lady who looks like an eight-year-old boy running out into the street in her bare feet. She may be liberal, but she's related to people who own guns. And just this week we've managed to manipulate her schedule so that she's sleeping in until 6:30 AM. Do you have any idea how indulgent this feels, to sleep in so late? No, you don't understand.

And, I don't remember ever talking to her about leprechauns, so I'm guessing this is one of those rotten things she picked up at school, like addition and subtraction. And what do you know, IT IS.

And this afternoon when I told her teacher about this early-morning tapping leprechaun, she said with a gleam in her eye, ""Oh yes, he'd be tapping, for sure. They're cobblers, you know.""
HAHA! I'm laughing because, that is just so damn brilliant. They have to deal with our kids all day long, and oh no. Is your kid waking up early? How sad for you who get to send them AWAY ALL DAY. It's like, if I'm going to blame the teacher for the leprechaun, she's more than happy to break out her fifty-page, single-spaced document of quirks she'd like explained, thank you very much.
