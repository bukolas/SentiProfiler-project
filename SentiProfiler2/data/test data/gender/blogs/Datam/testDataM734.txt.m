We'll have a half-and-half session this Sunday, courtesy Amit Varma and Mahesh Murthy (who's already done one quiz for us this season). It's IPL time, so please try to be there on time, so that we won't hold back all the eager T20 fans from their frenzy. :) Quizmaster: Amit Varma, Mahesh Murthy When: 3 PM, Sunday, 14 March 2010 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W). Directions: From the south: If you come north on Linking Road from Bandra to SantaCruz, you'll find a large Benetton Store on the right. At the end of that block is a Kotak Bank at the corner. Take a right and it's the next building, take the first gate and tell the sentry you've come for the quiz. From the north: If you get on to Linking Road at the airplane park end, you'll cross a HDFC Bank. A block later, you'll see a Kotak Bank on the corner - do not cross it. Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. We haven't been too regular about updating the blog announcements and results for quite a while now. But that doesn't mean we haven't been quizzing - so we'll try and catch up on the results and league standings as soon as possible. Meanwhile, it's quizzing as usual on Sunday, and Abhinav Dasgupta, who filled in on short notice in December (thanks, mate!) will do a proper quiz this weekend. The short quiz was good fun, so we should certainly expect more of the same this time around. Details and directions below. Quizmaster: Abhinav Dasgupta When: 3 PM, Sunday, 28 February, 2010 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W). Directions: From the south: If you come north on Linking Road from Bandra to SantaCruz, you'll find a large Benetton Store on the right. At the end of that block is a Kotak Bank at the corner. Take a right and it's the next building, take the first gate and tell the sentry you've come for the quiz. From the north: If you get on to Linking Road at the airplane park end, you'll cross a HDFC Bank. A block later, you'll see a Kotak Bank on the corner - do not cross it. Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. The folks at the Celebrate Bandra Festival asked us to put together a quiz for this year's edition. Details below - and cash prizes are there. I'm not sure how much, but it should be worth the early escape from work. The quiz, that is. We all know real quizzers don't get rich. ;-) Quizmaster: Sumant Srivathsan Research: Anannya Deb, Amit Pandeya and others. :) When: 4:30 PM, Saturday, 28 September, 2009 Where: Crossword Bookstore, Linking Road, Bandra Teams: Two or fewer members, no bars of any kind. Until after the quiz. Atulya Bharadwaj will do his quiz this Sunday, as we get into the thick of quizzing season. We will start an hour later than usual (see the new time below) as many of the regulars will be in South Bombay attending Dhananjay Shettigar's JBIMS Quiz . Dhananjay tells me that he will finish by 2 PM, which should give us all adequate time to get back to Santacruz for our regular season. For those who plan to be in Bangalore for the next season of the Landmark Quiz, this should be a great chance to sharpen your skills. Quizmaster: Atulya 'Monkee' Bharadwaj When: 4 PM, Sunday, 25 October, 2009 (Please be there by 3:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W).

Take a left at that point and it's the building next to Kotak Bank. Atul Mathew and Pradeep Ramarathnam have been promising their quiz for ages now, and after much postponements and emergency quiz schedules, we now get to actually have this urban legend quiz. This is Chakravyuh weekend in Pune, but we hope that you'll all be back after Saturday's Open Quiz to attend this one. After all, this is the BQC, and we're just better. Quizmasters: Pradeep Ramarathnam and Atul Mathew When: 3 PM, Sunday, 11 October, 2009 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W).

Since then, we have both grown large enough to no longer fit in such a desk. But Bombay is a big city, and it can accommodate many such large types. Sumo hosts his first BQC session on Sunday, and as always, it should be a cracker. Quizmaster: Rajen 'Sumo' Prabhu When: 3 PM, Sunday, 20 September, 2009 (Please be there by 2:45 PM for team assignments) Where: Pinstorm, Ground Floor, Swati House (Next to Kotak Bank on Linking Road), North Avenue, Santa Cruz (W).
