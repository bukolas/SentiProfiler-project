Speaking of diagnosing autism: it seems not just every state, but every country, city, town, hamlet or nation has their own criteria for diagnosing autism. The definition is so blown out of porportion autism label is becoming a total sham. Well, not total. There are really people with autism from severe to higher functioning, but one thing is for sure: there is an epidemic of overdiagnosing people with autism. I just saw a video on YOU TUBE titled: autism spectrum seems out of control. Watch it: it makes you think also go to you tube and type in autism self injury if your child is suffering from this type of behavior…also, make sure your child is tested for things like Fragile X, Celiac Disease and other things before your doctor slaps the autism label on your child! Lastly, do NOT let your school diagnose your child, they aren't qualified. Nor is the average pediatrician or even neurologist half the time. Then again, some people are so over enthusiatic to diagnose autism, even the people that should know better are screwing up. You can't diagnose a kid after a 20 minute office rooom observation. A good doctor rules out other conditions that could be causing regression or autistic like features and tendencies. Unfortunately, that's not being done these days. Kids are being diagnosed with aspergers and autism after 15 minute doctor visits. Docs aren't even asking historical background or running genetic tests or blood tests , allergy tests, urine tests, cat scans, etc…to check out if something else is going on….
