In my last post, http://jahaines.blogspot.com/2010/03/performance-tuning-101-what-you-will.html I talked about performance tuning queries that appear to be well tuned.  There are a lot of optimization techniques available unbeknownst to most developers that do not require indexes or radical code changes.  These are the optimizations that I will be talking about in this post.  There is absolutely no way I could go over every possible optimization technique available, but I will do my best to present as much content here today, and will make future posts on other techniques.
