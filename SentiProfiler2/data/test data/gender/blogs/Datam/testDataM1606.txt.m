Sometimes things are perfect.

When you find something perfect you then realize the other experiences you might compare to, you thought were perfect, werenâ€™t. They might have been really good or above expectation, but not perfect.

At 37 and a lover of food and restaurants I can count on one hand the number of perfect dining experiences. It takes a lot to pull it all together; location, atmosphere, food, drink, numerous employees that all have to be on target and in tune with you and your party.

So here is the place I now get to add to my perfect spots: Canoe.

Here are  the moments I want to capture (and I will not go through all of them as there many more highlights):

The grounds were beautiful. I know, grounds. I come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. Canoe is on the Chattahoochee river in Atlanta Georgia, nestled in a community of incredible estate homes. There is a walking path that winds through lawns with lovely flowers and plants all under the shade of mature trees.

They even had set some tables out on the lawn for a small party of 4 couples. They were right next to the water front a good 50 feet from the back porch of the building. While I was there they set up the tables and seated the 8. They seemed to really enjoy themselves and it was hard not to be impressed with this extra effort of having the wait staff travel the distance.
