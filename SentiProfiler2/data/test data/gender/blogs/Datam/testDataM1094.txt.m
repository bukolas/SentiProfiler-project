I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening. 

Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven.

Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon's restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I've eaten at a Damon's restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too.

Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave..... All in all a pretty full weekend and it's only Sunday morning. The Penguins play tonight at five and I'm already wearing my new white Jordan Staal jersey in anticipation..... letâ€™s go Pens
