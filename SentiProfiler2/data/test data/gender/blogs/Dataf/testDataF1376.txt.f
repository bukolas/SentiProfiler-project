Once again, our band of "Heroes," and I put that in quotes since the increasingly dislikable James remains part of the tribe, ran up against the dreaded "P-word" at this week's Immunity Challenge - puzzle. It's really no surprise the Villain braintrust is dominating challenges when it comes to using the ole' noggin.  What is alarming is Heroes leader, J.T's decision to oust one of the tribe's most intelligent players, Tom, in favor of James with his bad leg and equally bad mojo. Clearly, our Heroes are in bad shape, both physically and mentally.  But a nasty storm is quickly moving in over at the Villains camp, as Russell prepares to rain down hell on Rob.
