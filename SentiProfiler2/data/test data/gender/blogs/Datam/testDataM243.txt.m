At age 32, he can’t afford to play another season like that. Teams won’t continue to pay $2 million for that kind of performance. The interesting thing about 2009 was that Jody upped his line drive percentage. That usually leads to a higher BA, not a lower one. If he maintains that rate, there’s a good chance his luck changes and he winds up with a better 2010. New research shows that Hank Greenberg’s walk rate went way up at the end of 1938 season as he approached Babe Ruth’s single season home run record. Howard Megdal suggests that Greenberg’s religion caused the league to pitch around him, but Greenberg didn’t buy it at the time: Opposing teams tend to walk big home run hitters, and Greenberg showed a big leap in home runs in 1938, from a career high 40 the year before.
