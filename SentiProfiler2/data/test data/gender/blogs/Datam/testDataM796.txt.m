Apparently, I was not the only one who was not satisfied with the outcome of their lottery tickets. But throwing them on the ground is just wildly frivolous. You should always play AND DISPOSE OFF responsibly. Happy Thanksgiving! So CA Lottery people if you read this, please change the print on your lottery tickets. It should read "Play and Dispose Off Responsibly. Keep if you won."
