It was 63Â° today and the snow has finally melted off most of the sidewalks. So I made it over to Starbucks and had tea this afternoon. It was so nice getting out of the house and enjoying the warmer weather. Maybe winter is finally over, after all it's almost St. Patrick's Day! I could sure go for a Guinness or two about now.

The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations.....

The last few weeks I have been using my Netflix account to watch a ton of movies... plus the on-demand cable. Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck....
