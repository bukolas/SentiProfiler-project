Blacks are a disease, plain and simple. They pollute our esteemed nordic race more and more every day. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if in 50 years there won't be a single pair of blue eyes in the United States. Nothing will be dont about this. You all may post "come on, let's start the kkk back up", but the truth of the matter is the Law of the Land says that blacks are to be considered people of equality (what a joke) and killing one of them would be as legally binding (most likely worse) than killing a white person. It just makes me sick that black people can bitch and bitch about how unfair things are, and how they can openly hate white people. Whereas if a white person demeans a black in any way/shape or form, they are immediately labeled "under-educated" or "red-neck". HERE'S AN IDEA, LET'S INVENT AN INCREDIBLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS BLACKS. IT'S A FACT THE VICTIMS OF SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA ARE 97-98% BLACK... WHY CAN'T WE CREATE A VIRUS THAT HAS SIMILAR ATTRIBUTES BUT IS FATAL??? Whatever... I'm just spit-balling... White power
