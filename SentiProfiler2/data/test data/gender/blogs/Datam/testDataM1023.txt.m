I have become full of hated. As if I am 12 again. It us a terrible feeling. I want to be irresponsible and stupid. I want to hurt certain people. And I want to ruin lives. Including my own.

You were that needle that broke my god damn back. And all of the sorries in the world couldn't fix this. I have become so upset, that I want to insult you. And emotionally hurt you. But, that is not who I am. But, I am fighting myself to not just do it.

You have made me sick. You know who you are. And you may never see this.

I feel strongly enough to say that I might hate you. Fuck.
