Neither do i have that deep a knowledge about the game to understand nuances.. nor am i sharp enough to rattle out how many runs India won the nth match of the xth world cup by. This blog is not about that.. This blog is to say "Thankyou Sourav" for making cricket that "extra special". I dont know if it would have been the same for me without you. Yesterday, as I was watching the India - Eng ODIs i felt something strange... Its something i have been doin over the last 8 odd years, looking at you on the field.. changing field placements, smiling, frowning, exalting, shirt waving,jumping, puching, yelling,scolding and what not.. and every moment.. was pure joy. I did read somewhere.. "Sourav Ganguly pulled at the heartstrings of the masses like no other cricketer had done before"and I definitely agree.Being responsible for the collective mood of a nation,over such a long duration - fabulous job done.
