For example, there was a friend who was committed to some guy. And then we happened to ask this girl whether she was sure that this was the guy she wished to be with even after say, 10 years. The answer was 'no'. Then, why? The question is WHY? Why do people stick with people, get into a relation, have fun, and then break up? I don't say that all people are the same, and many of them are faithful, but there are many who are not. And even if we recognize the true colours of people, why do we keep passing on time in futile? Time pass? Is that the motive of all this? Love is so fuckin' blind? Are we stupid? Yes. Amen.

There was another guy who claims that he had a break up with his girl because that girl hated his doggy and hence, she dumped him. Now. Where is co-operation? Adjustment? What is love? 0_o

People might ask me to ease down a bit, and take things a bit lightly. They might tell me that I am too serious about life. But hell, atleast I think a couple of times before wasting my time on something or someone. Why holler around with something or someone with no purpose what-so-ever?

Another example: friend showing all the smses of a drunk lover: "ohh maan...your hazel eyes...and your lips...blu blu..bli bli bli...bla bla..." She laughed at him. And I laughed back loud like an immature oaf. And it seems to be a claimed fact that at the peak of teenage, you are supposed to take the opposite sex a bit lightly. Every Romeo, every cribbing lover happens to be a bastard within with verses of Satan running through his blood. Ahan. We girls(I mean, my species of girls) don't like it when a guy just uses the ladies and we love the 'one man for a life time'-and-the-blah-blah philosophy. But there are girls who can bet on their life to claim that we have to be treated the way we are being treated right now. A girl herself told a guy, that this is the age where we are supposed to know how the opposite sex is, and just hang out with her, and do 'time pass', and not to get too serious about her(say, expert guidance in misguiding the people trudging on right paths). Alright, everyone seems to be stuffed up with the same shit. Not cool. This seems so correct to most of the people, surprisingly. But for me, it seems so utter rubbish. Seems like some unwritten law. Not cool. It's crappy and unnerving.
