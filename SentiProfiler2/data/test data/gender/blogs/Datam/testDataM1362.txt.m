Christmas itself was wonderful.  It can be a very difficult time for someone with cancer as the disease becomes a giant elephant in the room and can often make it difficult to really enjoy the spirit of the holidays.  When I was first diagnosed seven years ago, I didn't even want to have Christmas as I didn't think we had anything to celebrate.  But this year, we surrounded ourselves with family ( including friends we now consider as family) and had a wonderful time.  Having my nephew's two-year old son Levi here provided that wide-eyed child component and my eighty-nine year old mother provided a link to a lifetime off Christmas memories.  It was the best Christmas I've had for many years and was very important to me as I worry more and more about what the future brings.
