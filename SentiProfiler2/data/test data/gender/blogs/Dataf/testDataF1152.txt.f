I wondered whether you may be able to offer some advice. I'm an Occupational Therapist working for the NHS in Sheffield;UK. A group of professionals have started to plan an ADHD group for Adults and we are generally involved in developing a service for this client group (very little support available currently). We are struggling to find information / research / examples of groups which we can learn from. We have a number of ideas including using psychosocial and behavioural interventions and have flirted with the idea of incorporating a sensory integration approach. However we are concerned about the little evidence on sensory integration and ADHD. My question to you is this: Can you point me in the direction of any evidence / journal name or particular paper /examples of good practise / contact name / ….etc for Adult support groups and Sensory Integration. If you do – I'll think yer amazing and tell all my colleagues about how wonderful you are!!! Does this encourage you?!* Anyway thanks for the website – it's already proved very useful and I look forward to reading the updates, Liz.
