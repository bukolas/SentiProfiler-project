We finished the Century ride last month with no problems. Since then, we've been doing 60- to 90- mile rides almost every weekend in addition to a 15-mile ride every weekday morning. And, I'm signed up for an Olympic distance triathlon in September, which is a 1500-meter swim, 40K hilly bike ride, and a 10K run. I've done triathlons in the past, but not for a few years and never this long. Ultimately I hope to do a half Ironman in 2011. 

The new painting series is still in a conceptual stage, though I did actually get some paint on canvas recently. It doesn't feel as important right now as the internal and physical work. Reclaiming the health that I lost last year has taken on monumental importance to me. Having always been prone to depression, I know what matters most to me right now, and this is it. 

But it's also about renewing my relationship to this place, which is the only geographical location that has ever truly felt like home to me. My new series will be about that: a sense of place. 

I also want to reclaim the vegan lifestyle that we were essentially forced to give up in northern Italy, where we reverted to unprincipled vegetarianism. Everything is affected by what we put into our bodies, everything. 

And now, some photos from the century and our recent rides.
