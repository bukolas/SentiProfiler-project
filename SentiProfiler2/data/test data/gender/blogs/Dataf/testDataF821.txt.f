Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis were the best Sci-Fi shows out there. Then the moron producers had to cancel the two series and put on Stargate Universe with a bunch of snot nosed bubble gummers. As a adult I hate watching shows that mistakenly put stupidity in a show in place of drama. Writers can't and I guess the producers can't make a decent movie or television series without stupidity. And on top of the stupidity, they think we want to watch a bunch of stupid kids acting like stupid kids.
