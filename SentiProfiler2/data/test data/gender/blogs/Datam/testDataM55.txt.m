Somewhere.. Somewhere, a kid is dying of hunger, and I just binned a huge slice of half eaten pizza..  A couple is looking at their new born with immense pride n hope, and I didn't pick my dad's call today for no reason..
The angels are putting a mad dog to sleep, and I shooed away a cat deep in slumber on my parked bike..
There's a girl being sexually exploited, and I'm secretly searching the net for new mms..
A clerk mechanically readies himself for another grueling week of mindless work, and I'm crying out coz nobody can understand my masterpiece..
A boy is celebrating his birthday with a candle but no cake, and I've already spent half of my salary treating friends..
A farmer is ecstatic coz its raining, and I curse the skies, for I have to wash my drying clothes again..
A woman has already started her long walk to fetch a litre of drinking water, and I just watered the plants with Bisleri coz the normal water tap is too far..
A man is in huge financial debt, and I'm filming red ants pouncing on a dying cockroach..
Someone is wishing he had more time, and I've taken almost half an hour just to decide what to wear for the evening..
Luck is not favouring the brave, and I'm sitting on my ass waiting for things to happen..
Another person is dying of H1N1, and I think I'm naturally immune to every disease..
Faith is keeping alive a woman stuck under the debris after an earthquake for 2 days now, and I'm thinking a pilgrimage is just bullshit business..
A mother feels proud on hearing her son has become a martyr, and I'm trying to put forth a theory that war is just a gimmick by governments..
A whole village is celebrating a girl's marriage, and I'm trying to convince a girl the word 'family honour' doesn't exist, just so I could sleep with her..
A guy is saying to himself 'miles to go before I sleep', and I'm already ruing waking up on monday morning for work..
We're all so dark, funny, stupid people..committing the same bloody mistakes each waking moment..

When will we learn?..
