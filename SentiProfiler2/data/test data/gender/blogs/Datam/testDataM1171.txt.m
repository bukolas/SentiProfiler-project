Feel Goodâ€¦.!!! :) Recently i have seen a video which says abt the secret of life.... tat video has inspired me a lot..
This is wat all of the video is about...

One of the best feelings that one can enjoy is to Feel Good. Feeling Good gives all the good feelings one can experience in life...either could be .... happiness, joy, love, gratitude, Appreciation, optimism, belief, hope, contentment, passion... watever
Feeling Good makes oneself to aspire watever he or she wants to be.... :) it involves a lot of positive energy in it ... to make tat happen...
These are the toughest times the world is facing now.... the terrorism, the financial crisis... or anything which disrupts peace...presently the world is ever bounding with all forms of negative feeling.. either could be greed, guilt, revenge, jealous , hatred, frustration .. these forms of feelings in oneself is directly or indirectly responsible for the present situation of the world... so let all of us stop blaming others ... stop feeling sad or dejected of the current situation ... stop discussing abt the hard times ... stop all the negative things...
let us all be +ve enough to encourage about the good in this abundant world....
let us all feel good... feeling good creates a healthier society... and thus a better world...
so from now on ... feel good about everything that you are... and sure the world around you is going to change.. and u can even see the change in the world too .... :)

FEEL GOOD... TO HAVE A BETTER WORLD... !!!
NOTE: CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU WANT RATHER THAN WHAT YOU DONT WANT...
thats the secret of life....
Spend some time in finding wat you want in life....
we have been always spending time thinking abt wat we dont want in life...
i dont want less marks in my exams
i dont want to lose my job...
we dont want wars to happen...
we hate terrorism... by this way we all are encouraging the world with t the thoughts we have....
"ALL THAT WE ARE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT WE HAVE THOUGHT"
SO OUR THOUGHTS DEFINE OUR WORLD
