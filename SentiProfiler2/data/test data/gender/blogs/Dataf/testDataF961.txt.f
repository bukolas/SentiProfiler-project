I’m having one of those days. You know the ones where you feel like utter crap and life lacks purpose. I’m having one of those moments where I realize I can’t keep doing what I’m doing and expecting the same results. You can’t wait around for someone to change things for you. It will never happen. In the end you can only really depend on yourself. You are your own ambassador and mascot. You control how your life is lived, what you do and say and ultimately your own happiness and success. I have been very fragile for some time now. I have let people, circumstances and things get on top of me. I have got used to being emotionally weak and sensitive and have not challenged myself to stand up and fight. I am far too nice and people take advantage of it. I can’t blame anyone but myself because I have LET it happen. I don’t want to loose that soft side of myself but I do need to learn to protect it when I need to. 

My anxiety has gotten worse and worse to the point where I have become agoraphobic and it has started to consume and run my life. I miss being me. I miss being the sociable, bubbly, crazy, fun, free spirited party girl. I miss my old friends who I haven’t seen in so long, and my best friends who I only see every couple of months. I miss a love life. I miss working fulltime. I miss having hope in my heart. I miss my life.
 
From this moment on I need to show myself that I can be STRONG. I will not let anyone put me down or let anyone tell me that I can’t do something. From this moment I shall seek out my own happiness. I shall seek out my friends and loved ones that I miss. I will get on TOP of my anxiety one step at a time. I will confront my fears HEAD ON!!
 I am a deserving human. I deserve happiness. And with my family and friends beside me I know I can accomplish anything!
One of my closest friends was extremely homophobic when I first met her. It’s not something she understood and she felt very threatened by it because of that. I never judged her for this but as we became closer friends and she got to know and understand me she became much more open. She is now one of my best friends and no longer feels threatened by bisexuality/homosexuality. If anyone needs someone to talk to about this subject feel free to email, comment or message me. If you disagree Id be happy to have a lovely debate with you. :) I am always willing to listen to other peoples point of views. And remember LOVE IS LOVE people.
