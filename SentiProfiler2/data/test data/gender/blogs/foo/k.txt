mmm.. just realised the i havent written a post since the dawn of the new year…not good na..i better write one.. but guess wat.. i havent even thought of what to write yet.. and i ve already begun ehh… !! CRAZZY! Hey thats it! i ll write abt being just a touch crazy! doing wacckky stuff! something like this.. being completely spontaneous.. with complete disregard to consequences..! wow! its fun man! just the other day.. some body asked me are u really this crazy or…and stopped mid way after the or..Sometimes i dont understand why ppl ask me such questions.. if i was really crazy did they expect me to answer in the affirmative.. or wat.. Never mind! On the other hand however.. wats wrong in being just a little crazy?? The biggest advantage as I see it is 40 years down .. when u are sitting in an easy chair with 2 yummy looking grandchildren one on each lap..u ll have storiess to tell!! U knoww.. granny was such a naughty thing when she was young.. ! I did this and that and this and that.. and the children will listen to u in awe and say.. myyy granny bestesst in their broken english! wow! priceless!

  Your neighbour’s kids have come home and are demanding tooti frooti icecream.. u have only vanilla.. so wat.. take some cut mango pieces from mom’s pickle garnish the vanilla…and say whoosh tooti frooti ice cream readyyy:P enjoy the cocktail and the appreciation!

Feel like wearing crazy jajjang clothes and going for a stroll? Just do it man..

Wanna go on an escapade all alone to the andamans.? Off u go!

 You are in office and its raining. Feel like enjoying the rain? Do it and charm one and all with the wet-look:P

 You see a beautiful butterfly fluttering past? Think u are six and go running after it… don’t bottle it tho… ( poor little thing) just enjoy the chase:P

 Why care what who thinks? Anything to break the monotony!
Whereever I go, I seem to have this habit of comparing the place with chennai. In Hyd the roads are real good (if you are from chennai, roads will seem good whereever you go:-)). Bur seriously, the roads are good. But people drive recklessly. The last time I went, I witnessed bikes sprawling on the ground and sparks coming...It was scary! That way, I think chennai is better. Since the roads are bad, you cannot drive beyond a certain speed. And in Hyd, the auto meters work!!!!!

Everyone knows motherhood is tough. That it takes as much out of you as it gives...both in time and joy. One invests so much time and energy into being that perfect mother - the kind who bakes cupcakes on Saturdays just because it is Saturday, who stays awake late into the night folding onesies and stitching fancy buttons on a costume - there are moments that one forgets to be a daughter.
Really! looking at my blog..i see only travelogues. Anyway, we had been to Swamimalai few weeks back. This has been a long pending visit - should have gone after our marriage. But better late than never. It is a nice temple, but after being a regular at kapaleeshwarar temple, I feel for the crowd Swamimalai is pulling, the temple could have been better maintained.
We also stopped over at Kumbeshwarar temple in kumbakonam.

7th Std - that was when I knew her first and over the next four years - I did think she was this very pretty girl with a very pretty smile who could talk well, but someone with loads of attitude and someone who could get into fights & arguments at the drop of a hat.

Don't know what created that opinion, but it stayed through out the four years that knew her. and then, the girls of E sections in 9th Std & 10th Std were kind of known for having attitude... and it was taken for granted she was one among them after all!

But 6 years later on, meeting again in Orkut and our communication over the past 1.5 years has completely changed my opinion about her - no.. not the opinion about her being a pretty girl, but her being a fighter-cock! And now I can go all out & tell how sweet, how nice, how warm and how friendly she can be! And she has also shown how strong a person can get to be in life!
wow!my dalu ramze! its really an immense pleasure 4 me 2 write a testi!v both r best pals rite 4m our 1st standard! shez my jutt dosth!i really felt the essence of true fndship in her!shez the sweetest thn on earth!she z the 1 knw who knwz completely abt me n my family!shez trust worthy! i still cant 4 get the ramzan in her house ! i ve 2 def say abt her mom very sweet shaki aunty! who exactly looks lik her sis! i shud really thank her 4 givin me such a wonderful fnd! the best is that in our 17 years of fndship v ve never fought ! though i raise my voice at times 2 her she has never raised until this date 2 me! so sweet of her u knw! shez the 1 who understands me! n she knwz all my answers b4 she asks the questionf! in short shez my other part!! the worst part s her fear towards each n every thin! my god! i cant explain it she fear s4 all useless craps! thiz shwz her sensitivity n innoscence! shez open 2every 1! other thin s tat shez an all time busy gal never c her sittin idol in any ocassion! i
Hi Shari, that's a good point regarding US-Asia.  I thought Jim mentioned
including US-Asia with another department, so it does make sense to
include them within your domain.

Yes, John Howe and Shankar Jagadeesan will be the technical leads that
have been instrumental in outlining the groundwork for the proposed
architecture and will be implementing these changes for both CMBA and
Liautaud.
Gautham sir is someone who is so very open to suggestions from people and while working under him I observed that quality and reminded myself to learn from that. All that I had to do while dubbing for the movie was just hear him say the dialogue a couple of times and then repeat it.  He would literally act out every line. The way he says the dialogues are just awesome, for lack of a better word. I thought even if I could 'ee adichaan' copy the way he says the lines, or maybe as best as I can, it would be easy. The sessions were always fun. A lot of times Mr Ganesh would also be there and he is a man who is fun to have around. He has a quirky sense of humour and a peculiar voice. He might just be saying something like "I want to drink water" and I would double up laughing just for the way he says it. A couple of times I met Silambarasan at the dubbing studio and he used to do a great job of imitating Mr Ganesh. All the sessions were happy times, fun, with great food. I discovered the desserts of Sandy's Chocolate Lab during these and we used to pig out on the food during breaks. Gautham sir and his team are great foodies. I met some great people, got to know them, made a couple of good friends in the process and this experience has given me beautiful memories that I will cherish.
My first testimonial ever scripted does deserve my best friend Edal Varma... Hai Edal this is nt to show u hw much our friendship n love means but to show the world that Allah has blessed me with a everlasting frienship in my life.....Masha Allah Edal u are someone great.someone peculiar indeed. Edal doesnt mingle much with people but those who deserve her friendship are gifted .She is soft humble n gt the least libran character.She is my JUTTDOSTH n im able to predict her at all situations.She gt her own way but im sure her path is always right.Her mom adds to her character n dedicates all her life to her only dayghter. EDAL a slim sleek beauty with an enchanting look almost resembles Deepika Padukone in her shape(LOL!) n the man waiting to hold her hands is more fortunate.Beauty is nt just the outer looks but also the inner heart that adds charm to it Edal sets an example for it.Edal u are really fantastic
decided to follow your words...committed to write your testimonial... so will do it though backing out is a much easier option! ok...lets get going... to start with, he's the most humble guy i've ever met. has got loads of tricks up his sleeve but doesn't look it one bit. U can look up to him as a role model for success, an avatar of sincerity or watever... but beyond his career and academic achievements, talents and brains lies a very helping, friendly and supportive person. he says he wants to do an MBA... but the way he speaks ull feel like he's a lecturer for MBA... god he knows of all the possible mgmt principles on earth...lol.. never say 'i know' to him or else ud have to hear a bigger lecture than what ud have if u dint know:-P and dont let my testi create any preconceptions about him in ur mind coz that's a terrible mistake too:-) likes to keep smiling all the time... for me he's been a great friend and an elder brother to look up to anytime
She is my benchmate from day 1 of college... first lady of our class... rite now shes doin a great job as our class rep... the only person i have seen being so possessive abt papers in her notebook... an awesome veena player... give her a tune and d next moment she wil play it for u... had lotsa fun wit her in college...innocent,caring,friendly and also a bit sensitive... she can very well take classes on 'how to blush' coz she does tat a lot.. one of my best friends in college and its good to have a friend like her.
this is the second testi i am putting up for this girl.well i had been asked for it,so you must all be knowing what i am going to say.
hmm aarthi has been my nice good friend since class five.we have great times together like cycling around the great moonwalk in adyar.acctually the fourth main road behind malar hospital was supposed to be really really bad,and we used to have fun cycling on the bumpy roads.then we also used to cycle to the beach and have great fun.
aarthi is fashion concious and trendy girl.she had got stuffs with her,if any girl runs short of anything,aarthi is there to help.very chweet and very help full.
her critics will always be true and are worth listening to.she used to darn crazy about mukkal drowsers<decently called as pedal pushers>and sleeveless tops,but now no way as she is in ssn.yet she is having her own kind of fun.then she is also a choco fan and she used to love getting dressed up.she likes me doing hairstyles for her,guess who am i????
i think its because he's piscean.. or maybe because he refuses to touch coffee and made me drop my addiction too (:D) .. or the fact that he lives on an 8th floor apartment with the most stunning view of the city.. or coz he sings so well..
it could even be coz he's one brainy dude who doesnt show it.. or his "anyaaya" enthusiasm for life and all its quirks.. maybe its because he prefers public buses to driving around in his zen,.. or that undying nature to flirt ... maybe its the way he seems to say everything that i want to, a minute before i actually say it .. lolz..
maybe its coz he's one big contradiction when it comes to the topic of tradition and modernity...
maybe its that contagious laugh.. maybe its his love for the "gaads" :) .. or that fact that he's totally like me.. or any number of things. i dont care really.
just take it from me for granted.. shiv's
one great friend... THIS guy, u definitley want to meet :)
I forgot to mention something and instead of inserting it in the previous post, I decided do write anew. Dubbing for Theeradha Vilayaattu Pillai and Vinnaithaandi... happened at the same time and the hero's name in both movies is Karthik. I was also dubbing for the Telugu versions of both movies and incidentally I had probably said the name Karthik a million times. One of those days I had a recording in the night and had to walk into the next day, I started calling random people and my mother also, with the name Karthik.. got up in the morning and said absent mindedly "Karthik... I want coffee" to Amma.. If I had mentioned any other name, she would have been happier thinking and had the feeble hope that I had finally found someone, but since she knew that was the name of the hero in two movies, at the same time, she new better. The number of times I have said Karthik or even the name Gautham in the movies I have dubbed is phenomenal. Karthik ... Gautham.. Gautham... Karthik.. There was a rare Shakthi or a Ravi here and there. Someone once told me that naming the hero and heroine is a big issue for several people and hence they usually just pick something ... like Prem or Rahul in Hindi movies.. they cited this example. I forget who told me this.. Anyway that is that.
well..in the prev testi,i just talked about his professional achievements;his academic achievements also deserve to be mentioned:best outgoing student in school and college,topper right from pre-kg to graduation,scholarship holder and university rank holder...whew.How did u manage all this dude...just listing all this out is pretty tiring ;-).But there is so much more to rama,sometimes i wonder how anybody could be professionally and academically so successful and yet not even show the slightest hint of haughtiness..on the contrary,he is an amazing person;always there for u when u need him.I will never forget those pep-talks and 'worldly-wisdom' sessions of his.He is been this awesome pillar of strength,hey...i have no clue what i would do without u pa.I know this is getting extremely senti but pls bear with me..i am still not done.He is also an amazing brother and a dutiful son.I just have NO IDEA how anybody could be such an Ideal creation but thats rama for u..dont ever change,be d same dude.....cheers
Emails have invaded our lives but we cannot do without mailboxes either can we? My son likes to check our mailbox to see if we have got any mails. It has now become more like a routine. Everyday as soon as his dad comes back from office, they both go and check mails.
It’s Friday, June 26, 2009.  I’m sitting across the room from Jeff Bridges and he’s talking about playing Kevin Flynn in Tron Legacy.  All around me are the most amazing artistic renderings of what the film is going to look like.  I’m smiling from ear to ear.

Last summer, when the movie was still being filmed, Disney invited a few lucky online journalists to the Vancouver set.  At the time, the movie was shrouded in secrecy and the few of us that walked onto the set were treated to an amazing visit and given a ton of access to the story, shown the practical sets, and we were able to interview the cast.  Since that day, I’ve waited patiently, wanting  to be able to recount all of my experiences on set and to be able to tell you what I saw and learned.
Jason Segel has found his rainbow connection with Disney's Muppets movie, signing to star as the human lead.

He also will join David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman of Mandeville Films/TV, the studio-based shingle behind last year's "The Proposal," as a producer on the project.
She is a very very sweet girl :)

Its hardly 2 months since I started talking to her. She is a fun loving girl. And she will make you smile :) Her smile is a most precious thing which she have. I always get inspired by way she overcome her stress.

Our IDS 506 gang just rocks!! We always meet to discuss about project but end up with guitar sessions or Marathi vocabulary or discussing about words like "Kote Rubber" or searching advertisements in you tube. In short, anything other than IDS 506 :D And what else you can except if Priya is around you!!

Keep Smiling Dear :) Hope you get everything in your life !!
What a match it was! Roger Federer at last won the epic final that lasted over four hours – his 7th Wimbledon Championship pursuit in which he had so much at stake. And he did it, - broke Pete Sampras’ record as the holder of maximum Grand Slam titles, became one of the few players to have won the French Open and the Wimbledon in the same season and of course regained the prized No. 1 spot. At the end of it all, he was smiling politely, no fuss, no tears – kissing the cup, perhaps the most coveted of all slams.
We were shocked to see that accident of our new vehicle, which we came to take our home. We were emotionally hurt by this incident. Immediately, we rushed to the Sales Manager of BIMAL, Mr.Dhanraj. Since, he was not available in the showroom one of his executive connected us over the phone to talk to him. We narrated the whole incident to Mr.Dhanraj. He started shouting at us and asked to get out of the showroom taking the same vehicle in the same condition. Giving the reason that the ownership of the vehicle is being transferred by making registration of the vehicle, Mr.Dhanraj told that he is no more responsible for anything that happened. When we requested him to come to the spot and rectify the problem, he started abusing us telling that he is having a family and not to disturb him on his holiday. We tried calling him again and again, he did not respond to our call. Further, a tedious struggle began to reach some other senior officers of BIMAL Auto Agency, but none of the executives gave any information about their seniors.

I'm writing in again...something must be really wrong with me...( just kidding)..
Hmmm....people she's great fun to be with....very caring...highly mischievous...hard core entertainer... 
I always associate u with Hubli...those days were so much fun...pulling each others leg..
The so called combined studies which were more concentrated on general issues rather than on studies... we used to talk the whole day in college but would still have a lot left to talk over the phone after college...n those rides on ur bike(spirit)...putting us on high spirits.. superb fun that was...
how much i miss all that... !!! but i'm glad that i was a part of all the fun ...
but what i don't like is u irritating me when i start telling about Maddy...i'm used to it though...i think i have covered most of the things..will keep updating when new things come in..
miss u loose....very much....
take care....
Well this girl is very neat.., always arranging her shelves (even if they are clean) .. a good coook ..can never forget the times when we used to cook and ask our mothers to judge whose cooking is good.. the library we used to fly off when we get hols.. ( you still got to return ur sweet valley novels..) .. i still remember the days when we used to go to church every evening.., praying for us to get seats in good colleges.. simple superb de.. those are one of the best moments in my life..
Steffi, stef,stefu etc etc. whatever people like to call her they do.. and she is always there to listen to them. four years or if I cut short the exact duration, its roughly around 36 months since I know her.
At college, she is 5% at her desk, 80% chatting remaining 10% thinking about shijo.. :D but still she does everything in time.She is just like a kid.
I don't know why but all of us just love to get bugged by her daily and without her its so boring. So, always be with us Steffi.
Like friends forever!
She seems like a teddy and initially i always wanted maintain a distance from her till one day.............guess what we had a fight!!!!
this is one of the rare qualities she had got ......beside talking funny and being superficially intelligent.................but to be honest she can be really smart sometimes.............sometimes she is exceptionally intelligent(I wonder it most have come coz she is influnced by me :)).
my pal ryt from the 1st sem.. a gal with a lot of values..n who lives upto them..a nice jovial gal..but not always:P..she can b very short tempered too...but most of the time..she's very innocent(i dont mean ignorant:P) n a very sweet person...a very funny n easy goin gal..likes to b funny n to appreciate funny things too..a gal impossible to forget!charanya does it all!..:)
Arabic Love
You turn.
There is such grace and beauty in that torqued motion,
in the way you look at us all.
I am going to dim my light.
So I can dissolve in yours.
I look at the vast stretch of barren fields that separate us.
I see many others have dimmed theirs too.
Is there a way to measure love?
Because you have conquered us all.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zoom-in: 
A woman, turned away, and dressed in white.A bright shade of yellow light fills the gaps, silhouetting her.

Zoom-out: 
The landscape melts into the frame. The woman is standing near a tree, and she is in the middle of an olympian field. 

Lights, camera, action!

A man comes running from behind, the penumbra of yellow light being gradually covered by the the man's presence.

Shift camera angle to man's view point:
He gazes at her, as if he wants this image to stay in his mind forever. She turns, and this movement of hers could kill him! This is abstractly portrayed by his decision to "dim his light", or his 'aura' (and therefore, arguably, his ego).
Oh man, that was one of the very few things I din't like about this movie. The hero's name. Karthik is a veryyyyyyyyyy common name and I would want directors to chose something apart from the regular ones.
mammmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ashok raj is really good friend of mine................he s padips of our class...........really good in programming........he always tells tat he din study anything(something fishy behind tat!!!!!!!!!!) but ll get gud marks...........he really cares for his friends.........helps a lot before exams(definitely not inside the hall)...........he s one of the sincere sigamani s who sit in the first row and listen interstingly to the boring lectures..............he s also good in sports (he s a district player in volleyball) and also a good badminton player....................and one more thing his friend circle is really huge.... he has friends all over chennai..............jus name an area n he ll be knowing someone there.........great machan u rock da......................
well, i finally sat down to write testi for one of my grt friend. seetha thats how i call Ramya, is one of my oldest friend. our friendship has flourished our lives. my memories are still so fresh. we had silly fights and i still remember one of them. seetha and me are same height, so in our class we sat in height order & thereby i had to sit with her. seetha used to fight alot. (so slightly scared). and then to avoid fights, we used to measure the length of the bench & then divide it by 2. & draw a line using chalk, declaring borders. it was like LOC only. missing those crazy school days. and now i see the same beautiful girl in a very different perspective. she has grown bold, daring and so matured. i doubt whether seetha fights nowadays. i can never see anyone who can be so ambitious & stand up inspite of lot of struggles in life. she is very friendly & i admire the contacts she has with old friends. she never forgets you, if u r in her friendship list. wish our friendship lasts forever. keep smiling dear.

someone once said "There is no sincere love than love for food"

I miss my grand mom's cooking. I was with my grand parents during my childhood. Making milk cova was such a tedious process then, almost takes a day. Since its made on stove with burning wood, it used to be not pure white as we get in shops today, but nothing tastes as good as it.

my grandfather used to get all sorts of fruits/nuts from our farm, baby groundnuts, raw custard apples, corn and my grand mom used to toss them onto hot coal and they used to taste like heaven.

She felt her life was sprinting away from her as she scrubbed baby food off the kitchen floors and folded baskets of laundry. Wasn't she more than just a mother? She read books, sang songs and was more than capable of holding a conversation on any topic under the sun for over 10 minutes.

One of the best parts about writing a book (apart from the actual writing of it) are all the invitations you get to go places and talk about it. I always feel like something of a fraud when I get up on those panels, ready to discourse on Indian Women And Sex or whatever the topic of the day is. A fraud because, well, I wasn't trying to make a statement or speak for Indian women in general, not with this blog, not with the book. I was just talking about stuff that happens, to me and sometimes to my limited circle of friends and acquaintances.
I can't sleep. I really should be in bed but after tossing and turning while trying to fall asleep, I decided to hang out here and blog instead. Maybe if I empty my thoughts I can actually relax enough to go to bed. I feel like I have had a week long rectal exam. Seriously, my anus hurts just thinking about it. The bank has been poking around our asses for a couple of months now. At first it wasn't so bad. We were approved for a nice size loan and we decided to stay under $20K of the pre-approved amount. So it's not like we were breaking the bank. Then we decided on a new home and the new loan was $35K under the pre-approved loan amount. We patted ourselves on the back for being so frugal. A poke here...a poke there. We can handle that. Our bank seemed to be taking their sweet time but they assured us all along that we were on schedule. About two weeks away from our closing date and all hell breaks loose. It's like they put on their rubber gloves, broke out the petroleum jelly and got their " all up in yo bidness " faces on. I actually had to send them a signed letter yesterday explaining to them that my "alias" on my credit report was my maiden name. I mean, seriously?? I could drone on and on about each and every thing the bank has asked for, and how many times they have lost stuff we have provided. They even forgot to cancel the first loan and even though they sent us a letter stating they had cancelled it the first week in February, they didn't even realize they forgot to until our file went to underwriting and those folks caught that we had two loans on two houses at the same time. Of course, they wear some big britches over there at the bank, so all we can do is sit with our palms out, and play nice until they give us our money. As much as I want to hurl every four letter word I know at them, I grit my teeth and allow them to continue shoving their heads up my butt only because I don't have $200K sitting in my bank account right now. When we bought our first home, we had none of this nonsense. Of course we built that home 8 years ago when the economy wasn't in the shitter. We got our mortgage through the builder since they were offering up a sweet package deal. We have made all of our payments on time. We have stellar credit, and the income to loan ratio is well within our means. We have played this as smart as we can and yet, we are still up late at night biting our nails and wondering if the bank will give us our loan so we can finally have a home again. I don't know what would have happened if we had a couple late payments, or if we had something happen to drop our credit just a tad. I am scared to even think about that outcome at this point. It seems that we, the little people, have to pay for all the mistakes these big banks have made over the last decade. Not only are we digging into our pockets and throwing these guys a bone or two so they don't go bankrupt, but now we are taking it up the rear so they can protect what's left of their assets. We just can't win. You'd think banks would welcome people like us with open arms but instead I feel like this: "You want a piece of me?" No thanks, Mrs. Cheapskate. Keep moving. So here is my situation. We could have closed on our home this past Friday, but because of the two loan errors they have pushed it to this Friday with a possibility of closing sooner if they wrap it up sooner. So we close on Friday. We scramble to order appliances, paint what we can and clean the place up all weekend. We set our move in date to retrieve our items out of storage on Monday. Oh...did I mention my husband goes out of town on Monday? Yeppers. He's out of town pretty much for two weeks as we put our house back together again. Not to mention the move out of our apartment. Gee, I wonder why I am losing sleep right now... On a happy note, I ordered my curtains for the dining room. Yes. I totally effed myself there, didn't I? Taking the plunge and ordering curtains for a home I don't own yet. I know....shame on me. But I pushed my superstitions aside and junped on these curtains because they were on sale. I even ordered them online (eek!) so I have no idea if they will be the look and feel of what I really want, but I am winging it since I saved like $100.00! I dropped $47.00 for the pair so I feel really good about that. They are a grey damask pattern. I am in love with damask right now. Common sense tells me that I need to be more wiser in my color choices, being that I have three monsters and two dogs that will be running in and out of that patio door dragging in who knows what from outside and wiping their ketchup fingers on my dry clean only elegant damask curtains...but the little princess inside me screams for some sort of femininity in a sea of males. These curtains are my lipstick, dammit! I just have to pray, they don't end up covered in actual lipstick, being that my toddler has a newfound infatuation with my makeup purse lately... Welllll folks. I am actually getting sleepy again. Looks like hammering out this post helped after all! It's the beginning of a great day! At least that is what I'll tell myself as I bend over and grab my ankles... Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Good Morning, Everyone! I've been busy getting ready to move from our apartment to our home, but I took a break and was checking out some of blogs off my sidebar and on The Whitt's family blog: The Whitt's there was a post that struck me and I felt I had to share with you in hopes you can help Spencer raise money towards a cure for childhood cancer in honor of his sister Tuesday. Some of you may remember little Tuesday Whitt's battle with neuroblastoma. Her story is one I will personally never forget. Tuesday was a little girl I never met in person, but through her family blog, her courage and grace touched me. Her mother, Jessica has continued to blog and over a year after Tuesday went to be with our Lord, I think of Tuesday and her family every single day. Seeing Spencer on the site in a photo holding Tuesday, and the words that he was going to shave his head in his little sister's memory....I am moved beyond words. I wish I had all the money in the whole world to donate to St. Baldrick's. If you would like to donate, you can visit Spencer's page on the St. Baldrick's site. In the meantime, every cent counts. So please, even if you can't make a monetary donation, please visit The Whitt's and read the post, then share the word any way you can, blog it...tweet it....facebook it..whatever you can. Awareness is so important! God Bless! --NOTE-- If you are like me and you prefer to donate via Paypal, there is no paypal option on the St. Baldrick's site. On The Whitt's Blog is a sidebar with a "donate" button which is a paypal option. You can send a note saying you are donating for Spencer's St. Baldrick's fund. Just thought I would let you know to save you the trouble if you like using paypal!! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom I was introduced to the Old Fashioned on my first trip to Wisconsin to meet my husband's family. I am not a big drinker and I favor beverages like margaritas, mojitos, plum wine, beer with lime, anything fruity. In my life as a mom, I never get to go out so on the rare occasion that I find myself at an actual bar, I end up frozen like a deer in the headlights when asked what I want to drink. This moment arised on my trip to Wisconsin, and my husband ordered me a brandy Old Fashioned Sweet. A few minutes later, he arrived with drink in hand. It was a rosy pink bubbly drink with green olives. Hmmmm....interesting but I felt a bit adventurous that night so I gave it a go. The Old Fashioned was an instant hit with me. It was so good! Sweet, a bit fruity and the olives...if you save those and eat them just before the last sip...they are a perfect end to this drink! You can make the Old Fashioned many ways. Mainly there are two ways to order it, either Sweet or Sour. Sweet usually means using Sprite in the mix. Some people like to pass on the olives and garnish with cherries and an orange slice. You can use whiskey or brandy. Brandy makes it sweetest. Sour usually means using Squirt in the mix. I like the sour version just as much as the sweet. I've had garnishes like green olives, and pickled brussel sprouts (again WEIRRRD but really good once you get over the fact it is a pickled brussel sprout, haha!) Whiskey is normally the choice of liquor for the Old Fashioned Sour. Try ordering the Old Fashioned outside of the midwest and you will likely see the bartender stumped. We tried several times in Denver and usually got something completely different than we wanted. It was never the Wisconsin Old Fashioned. Here is what you need to make an Old Fashioned: Old Fashioned Cocktail Mix: (1 ounce) (It's hard to come by outside the midwest but if you are an online shopper there are a few places that sell this mix. I found a three pack gift for $18.99 plus $6.99 shipping.) Alcohol: (2 oz or to your preference) Choose from Whiskey, Bourbon or Brandy Soda: (1-2 oz) Sprite, Squirt, Club Soda...I like Grapefruit Sierra Mist or the cranberry soda that comes out around the holidays. I prefer using diet soda to save myself some calories. Garnish: orange slice, cherries, green olives, pickled stuff, lime wedge... This drink is served on the rocks, preferably in an old fashioned cocktail tumbler, hence the name! After a long week of chasing kids, nothing is better than a couple Old Fashioneds on a Friday night! I hope you enjoyed this taste of Wisconsin! I love sharing these midwest tidbits with you! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Lots to do as we prepare to move again! So I leave you this weekend with a weiner. No, not my gay dachshunds though I am sure they would slobber all over this hunk of meat! Have a pleasureable weekend! Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom (Thanks hubby's co-worker for the tip!) Remember this sign? Looks like word got out about my Nickname...(ok really it's just a funny coincidence!) Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom This morning I woke up, knowing that today was going to be a little tough and ready to get the day over with. It's a gloomy day, with a steady light rain cleansing the surface. I was happy to see green grass poking through the dead stuff. While driving my son to school, the radio announced that Corey Haim had died of a prescription drug overdose. "Take it back!" I yelled at the radio. My 6 year old looked at me like I was nuts. Before they were finished announcing this sad story, my phone rang. It was my husband calling to tell me the news. Corey Haim was my childhood crush. To say I was in love with him is an understatement. It was more like obsessed. I had planned our wedding numerous times. I knew we were soul mates. I had posters covering every inch of my walls and ceiling when I was a teen. I would trade Tiger Beat and Bop photos with my friends. They all wanted NKOTB pictures so I would collect as many as I could to trade for Corey Haim posters. I didn't have a lot of consistency in my life, and Corey Haim stayed with me, in many bedrooms for many years. His posters were worn and ragged with missing edges from the countless times I moved him from one home to another. To think that he died on the same date that my Father died...Damn. It is just a coincidence, but it just makes March 10th even sadder for me. I fell in love with Corey while watching Lucas. In the movie, he was so sweet and shy. He was also determined, and that quality reminded me of myself. He had a broken home, he was picked on at school, and he just kind of shuffled through life without being noticed much. In the end, he won the affections of his school and his town as well as the adoration of a 10 year old girl. When Lost Boys came out, I felt like I had struck gold! My older foster siblings were drooling over Jason Patrick, but I was all about Sam. Corey had grown up from little boy to totally rad teen. I was in love. The scene with him singing in the bath tub. That was my favorite. I'd watch it over and over and sigh with stars in my eyes. He was so dreamy... I never really understood why everyone referred to Corey Haim and Corey Feldman as "The Two Coreys" they never really seemed like a good pair to me. Just because they made a couple of movies together, and they shared the same first name. I think that paved the path for failure for both of them because it was almost like they were expected to make movies together even though they really were very different in ways that made for bad movies. Don't get me wrong, I loved License to Drive and the Lost Boys. But when they got around to Dream a Little Dream that is when they really should have aggressively explored their independence. I think they were waiting for the next big script that would pair them up and it never came. By the time they came out of their drug induced stupor long enough to realize it, they were already considered to be another washed up pair of Hollywood kid actor casualties. Corey never left my heart. The good thing about movies is they can be played over and over and I would get lost in Coreyland daily, whether it was through pictures or movies, he was my future husband and that bond (though one sided) was solid as a rock. Somehow through the years, as things changed in my life, I outgrew the Corey posters, but always had a place in my heart for him. I watched him go from smiley kid to troubled teen. From troubled teen to the man on the A&amp;E reality show "The Two Coreys" I was so sad for the loss of the Corey I fell in love with. That Corey was dead. Long ago buried by a mix of drugs, alcohol and prescription meds. My heart broke for the young kid with so much potential. I was disgusted with the shell of a man Corey turned out to be. I didn't understand why he felt his life was so hard, he couldn't face it without some sort of high. Then came the fight between him and Corey where he broke down and said that Corey Feldman knew his "friend" had molested him and he did nothing to help him. My heart ached for him. I know that kind of pain. It can eat you alive. For some reason, victims have a common trait, they blame themselves for what happened to them. The guilt...it consumes you. To be a successful actor, in the prime of his career...to have someone rip your innocence from you in such a disgusting way, and then know that your only friend doesn't have your back...that explained a lot to me. To know that Corey never got counseling for this, that he turned to drugs and alcohol to numb his pain, it is just so very sad. I hope that Corey Feldman finally comes forward and brings justice for Corey Haim. I don't want to know who hurt Corey, but whoever did needs to be punished for his actions. If this man is still out there, who knows how many people he has hurt along the way. 38 years old is too young to die. It is so tragic. Even though he did this to himself, his life was full of people who enabled him. This could have been avoided if someone loved him enough to step in and help him get the care he needed and helped him to understand that what happened to him was not his fault and it was not ok to bury it the way he did through all those drugs and all that anger. Now, Corey Haim can stop running from his demons. I pray that he can finally rest in peace. This is the way I want to remember him... Sadly, in death there are no take backs. Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom It's foggy, cold and dreary today. I'm stuck indoors in my apartment. As my son naps, I am alone with my thoughts. So I'm just going to dump 'em here and wait for the sun to peek out. Tomorrow marks 3 years since I lost my Dad. I knew it was coming. I try and pretend that my heart is healed from losing him, but it is still broken. I feel orphaned. I felt that my whole life, and then for a little while I got a taste of what it was like to have a parent. Some days it was nice. Others, it took work. But when it came right down to it, I truly enjoyed being someone's daughter. When he died, the daughter part of me died with him. I miss being loved like a daughter. I miss the bond we shared. His big bear hugs. His gentle nature. His goofy sense of humor and the way he would smile with his blue eyes. He was a beautiful man, and now he is a beautiful spirit. I pray he can see my heart and feel my love 
or him today, and know that my love for him has not faded with time. I do want to thank everyone that left me encouraging words when I posted the note from my mother . I haven't had a chance to write you each individually, so I want to tell you how much your words meant to me and how they lifted me up and gave me strength when I needed it. I pride myself in being strong, but every now and then I know it's ok to gather the strength of others when you hit a weak patch. I have been tossing around the idea of writing my mother back. One moment I tell myself not to bother, the next I feel I need to give her a piece of my mind. The teeter totter balanced favorably towards me responding, so I did. I feel better now that I have said what I needed to say and I can finally move away from that negativity. Onward and upward. My bank was supposed to respond to us yesterday in regards to closing this Friday. They have yet to respond. I find it frustrating when people think they can just not bother answering you, just because they have no news. I'd rather them just call and update us, even if it is "Hey, we are still working on things but I will let you know once we have an answer" instead of "Hey, I'll have an answer by the end of the day..." then nothing...nada. Not even returning calls or emails. Makes me want to scream. Sitting here in this apartment wondering when I can get my hands on our house is making me want to scream. I think I'll have to go back to digging through catalogs and get lost in design dreamland. That has been my sanity saver! If only I was like a buzillionaire, I could actually buy everything my heart desires!! Money does not buy you happiness, but cool stuff from catalogs makes me happy! Of course I can be happy about one thing today...at least I don't have a mega case of the crazies like Lindsay Lohan! OMG - she has flipped off her rocker. Time's up! This concludes my therapy session. Have a Nice Day. --Update-- Sun came out to say hello! I snapped this picture while driving and then it faded away again. Keep on the sunny side... Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom Good Monday to you!! I hope you all had a great weekend! I am super excited because a week from now we should finally be in our home!! In my last post I shared some ideas I have been pondering for my kids playroom. Over the weekend, I got my first Land of Nod catalog and there were a ton of cute ideas in there! One picture captured almost exactly what I envisioned for my boys' playroom: I especially love the chalkboard wall cling panels! They come in a set of 4 panels and chalk for $58.00 Of course I think $58.00 is a bit steep so I did a search to see what I could find for less: I found a great vinyl chalkboard panel for $38.00 from Etsy.com store Wilson Graphics It measures 24.5" Wide by 48" high. The Land of Nod panels when combined measured 38" x 49" so for a little less chalkboard space I still get my money's worth! I picture applying the chalkboard "sideways" as opposed to how the photo displays it. That way I get the look I am going for. I also LOVE the funky alphabet letters in the Land of Nod catalog photo. In the catalog they are asking for $49.00 for a set of 51 letters. They are not reusable so when they come off they stay off. I went on an Amazon hunt to find me a bargain! For just $12.99 I found an adorable complete alphabet set that is reuseable and includes upper and lower case letters! I'm thrilled with this price! I'm an Amazon freak so I know I will find something else to buy so I can get my free super saver shipping! Maybe I'll buy these cute number wall decals to go with the alphabet! Last night I was at Target with my husband and I was on the prowl to find a good deal for my playroom. I came across this cute organizer on sale! It's normally $59.00 but at Target this week it is only $37.00! That's $22.00 off! So I snagged the second to last one! The book rack in the Land of Nod catalog is $199.00 but you can grab a Kidcraft Sling Book Holder from CSN Stores for just $29.95! I love the table and chairs set in the photo, but I am not at all willing to spend $140.00 on two chairs and $249.00 for the table as shown in the catalog. The biggest feature I love is the storage under the table and I found this adorable KidKraft table and chair set for only $89.99! Just think about it...for a little more than the cost of one Land of Nod Chair you can get an entire set! Or if you like the look of the warm wood with the colorful chairs you can opt for the KidKraft Euro Honey Table with Four Chairs for only $159.95! I looked at places like Amazon and Wal-Mart and they were $50.00 higher than Allkidsfurniture.com! Notice the cute polka dot mat under the table in the photo? Land of Nod sells these "Splat Mats" for $39.00! I found one at JazzyJem's Artfire shop for only $28.00 which inludes shipping! So let's do the math: Land of Nod Play Room: $736.00 Cheapskate Knock Off Playroom: $305.90 (which includes the storage organizer and the more expensive table and chair set!) Pretty Impressive, huh? Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom
Have you ever found yourself sitting in your bedroom, travel bag open on the floor, empty. Plane leaves in a few hours? A few articles of clothing are neatly folded on the bed ready to go. Those are the ones you are SURE about. The rest still happily reside in the closet or in drawers. Ok, maybe there are some things in the hamper or draped over the chair in the corner. Thing is, eventually they all need to get into that bag. (Here is where I wish we had one of those machines, in the Jetsons, so I could put the bag on the conveyor belt and it would pop out on the other side all packed.) I love to travel. I don't mind the waiting in airports, long flights, turbulence and any destination seems exciting to me. But it's getting my bag packed that I just want nothing to do with. Especially when I am leaving for longer periods of time. I am headed to Greece to play for a professional team there. How am I going to know what the weather will be like in 4 weeks, let alone 4 months? Do I need any nice clothes or just mainly for working out? And shoes! Hardest thing to pack. High heels have weird shapes. Tennis shoes are bulky. Uggs are worse.... but SO necessary in the cold after an outdoor night practice in the rain. (Sometimes I wish aquatic sports only practiced in warm locations. Hawaii or the South Pacific would do great. Thanks.) I always make sure to lay the swim suits, goggles and caps on the bed first. If I left without those....well, why am I going in the first place? (Because, while I will be living in a foreign country it is NOT just for a vacation. I do have to "work" er, workout rather.) Then there are toiletries and make-up......it is nice to not look like a drown rat ALL of the time. Ok, so just one bag?!? Thanks to all the new travel restrictions, there are those pesky weight and checked bag limits. TOO MANY things to consider. Can I hire someone to do this for me? The one very important travel tip I picked after traveling with the National Team for a few years was the use of a small roller bag as a carry-on instead of a backpack. Most of the veteran players on the team used them when I first started. I never really thought about it. I was all excited to sport the team gear and get to where we were going. Until we arrived, some 20 hours later, got in a bus and headed straight to the pool for a training session. Not only were my legs swollen from the flight, but my back and shoulders hated me every stroke I took from shlepping that backpack, with "all the comforts of home" in it, across the world. So, while my bag was not packed. The carry-on was. That is the easy stuff. &nbsp;A few books (Having a little english around will be nice when the Greek letters get too much for me.)&nbsp; Computer I-pod Various charging cords (These take up a surprising amount of room.) Surge protector box (Life saver! Frying the life out of your precious electronics is not fun when so far from home!) 15 pounds of Valentine's Day candy intended to spread some American love to my teammates My new water bottle The water bottle was actually the first thing I put into the carry-on. Drinking water is my New Year's resolution. Mostly because without a regular workout routine I forget to drink anything. Very bad for an athlete. I didn't want to buy plastic bottles anymore and I figured with a bottle like this, I would pay more attention to my drinking habits. Once packed and at the airport my lovely new bottle had me paying attention to many other things. Like the fact that it is metal and looks a little like a bomb. Great. That can't go in my carry-on. Security would have me red flagged in two-seconds. So now, standing in the check-in line with bottle in hand, when I thought all my packing issues were behind me and the worst hiccup was just this bottle, came the best travel challenge of all. Man at Check-In Counter: "Hello Ms. Where are you headed?" Me: "Greece" MaCIC: "Please place your carry-on on the scale." Me (in my head): "Carry-on? I have never had my carry-on weighed before. Just as long as it fits in the little overhead thing they seem to wave you on by. ON NO. IT IS HEAVY!" I placed it on the scale.....&nbsp; MaCIC: "Ms. your bag weighs 18kg. We only allow 8kg for our carry-on items." Me: "Oh no." (in my head) "Where exactly am I going to put 20 pounds of stuff, when my other bag is packed so tight it is about to explode out of the new purple straps I bought to keep it together on the journey?!" MaCIC: "Yes Ms. Only 8kg." Thanks buddy. I heard you the first time. This is how I came to find out that the candy I was bringing over to the team weighed about 15 pounds. When I put it on the little scale he had, it weighed 8kg by itself. Perfect. I also come to find out the roller bag itself weighed 7kg. HOW was this going to work???? And how in over 10 years of international travel had this never happened to me before? I never wanted to be that passenger that has to open up her bags, right there in the check-in line and begin the rearrangement dance of all my worldly belongings in front of a line of my fellow passengers. But that was me. I believe by the end, everyone knew that my favorite brand of underwear is Victoria Secret, I read love stories and adventure novels, most of my clothes are blue and purple and I may have a serious sweet tooth. That is enough for the person behind me in line, to make me a profile on Match.com. And next to me, I now had two travel bags. One still bulging, being held together by purple straps. And the other- a heavy duty plastic bag, duct taped so well you couldn't really tell what was inside it. Both with airline stickers. Destination- Athens, Greece. Thank god the packing part is over. If you are a part of the wonderful time sucking social networking extravaganza, we know and love as Facebook, then I have a challenge for you! Most sports in this country, the ones you all know and love, and will find on television almost every week of the year, have incredible monetary backing. And the athletes are taking home paychecks in one year that could finance my training for my entire carreer. As small sport like water polo, that finds its sporting stage once every four years at the Oylmpic Games, we are entirely dependent on the funding we get from the United States Olympic Committee and our sports National Governing Body, the non-profit organization, United States Water Polo Inc. Without this, my team and I would not be able to train, or travel and participate in, competitions to get us ready to represent our country. So when I heard about the Chase Community Giving page on Facebook I realized, this opportunity may be the easiest way for anyone to give back this holiday season and give a huge boost to our sport!! Simply go to the Chase Community Giving page and cast your vote for us. Then Chase will give money to the charities that have the most votes.....and the deadline is TOMORROW!!!! With a few clicks of your mouse you could be giving my team an incredible gift. A chance to continue our journey towards GOLD in the 2012 London Olympic Games!!!! I have included a link below to direct you to the page! And if you are not a member of Facebook.....this is a fantastic reason to join!!! THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU WHO VOTE FOR US!!!!! In Olympic Spirit....... Come Watch Us Play!!!! When I found out I needed surgery the first question I had was... "What is the recovery time?" Of course soon follows the standard "4-6 weeks" response. (Oh, I am tottaly going to be that 4 week part of the standard deviaton.) The surgeon, the therapists and doctors all saying the same thing: "You will be up and moving around right after the surgery, and back doing what you do in no time!" As an athlete, 4-6 weeks was already too long. &nbsp;This theory of "no" time was going to be interesting. I hit the 6 week anniversary of the operation and had a follow up appointment with the surgeon. He told me at this point the incisions and tissues in my knee were healed. I still had a bit of swelling and I would now be in a battle with scar tissue for range of motion. With 5 1/2 weeks of therapy, I could walk normally, I could do all minor strengthening excersices, and from what I could see (photo) I had lost a LOT of muscle in my leg. (How hard it is to build up the muscle and how fast it departs!) So began the battle. Playing water polo requires a rather awkward rotating motion we do with our legs. "Eggbeater" had never seemed stange to me. I could do it for hours, maybe days. Supporting myself in the water was as easy as breathing. Yet the scar tissue on either side of my patella tendon and through my capsule was creating a loud"pop" doing even the simplest of things. Like bending me knee from a straightened postion. Wait, that happens when you walk. Yup, not too comfortable with normal linear motions. So doing anything even close to water polo was not going to happen. Yet. It became quite clear that what I was going to struggle with most at that point was maintaining a positive outlook with my (what I feel is WAY TOO SLOW) progress back to an athletic level I think is satisfactory for playing on the National Team again. I know everyone is different. Our bodies heal at their own rate. And I am quite frequesntly reminded I am no spring chicken anymore. (I'm not? Age is a number....I guess until you try and heal something and realize, yes, you really are 31. Boo.) But, I think my lifestyle- staying fit and active and absorbed in this pursuit of something I am passionate about, has made me feel a bit invincible. I attack things thinking I can achieve anything if I just try hard enough. And I still believe that to be true....it just might take a little longer than I previously envisioned. I was not leaping around after 4 weeks, or 6.....not even 10. Uggh. Now in the 11th week I have seen the most progress. I think I have clawed my way up the mountain I had in front of me. Breaking holes in the sheets of ice, slipping back down a few times, but finally nearing the summit. And what kept me going, besides the images and sensations of future practices and games floating through my head, were appreciating the small moments of joy. Like dressing up for Halloween at the therapy clinic. I broke out my tutu from my ballerina costume two years ago. And our trainer Lance, sported an amazing Spiderman costume. :) Or making a trek up to LA to see Joshua Radin in concert for the first time. I got Joshua's CD Simple Times &nbsp;from a friend last year. It was about the same time I was trying to decide what path I should set out on post Olympics. And for some reason the sound of his voice was really calming to me. I would listen to his music as I walked around Greece, or when I was reading or hanging out at home and it would help me think. When I found out about his show I had to see him live. And again, those songs helped to calm my anxiety about the healing process and focus me back on the good. And of course taking more pictures...... Black Friday getting brighter as Christmas lights start to come on! My life's pursuit, as of now, is what many others would call a hobby. Cultivating another hobby has never been high on my list. I have always loved to take photos. My little "point and shoot" camera has served me well, documenting my adventures and travels. But.....if I could make a job out of one of my passions, could I do the same with another? Why not give it a try. I have a new "more complicated" camera. And with the extra time I have while recovering from surgery I think I will learn more about photography, how to properly use this camera, experiment with taking photos and dream up ways in which to use my photos in the future. You never know what can come of your dreams once you put them out in the universe. :) These were the first photos I took this morning with the new camera. This kitty lounges on this car every day and seems to be in a perpetual battle to try and keep her coat clean. Always licking and preening. It is no wonder, with how dirty this car is. I was only going to post one photo, every day, from the batch I take. But it is so hard to choose. And I like it when groups of photos can tell a story. Maybe as I get better I will be able to narrow it down. We shall see. Ravishing Designer Blue Cap- $5 Exquisite Red Plastic ID Band- $10 Warm 6000 Count Cotton Blanket- $15 Limited Edition Sticky Thermometer Gauge (on my forehead) - $25 (Or is that a bar code to scan me in at the supermarket?) 1 Un-Swollen, Pain-Free, Non-Popping Knee- PRICELESS The surgery before mine took a little bit longer than scheduled. As I lay there I began to get a little anxious. Incredible teammate and friend, Ericka Lorenz, had driven me to the appointment and was trying to distract me from thinking about what was coming. She blew up a surgical glove and we drew on it. Something so simple. Made me smile and head to surgery with less stress. :) Dr. Scott Graham did a splendid job. Now it is up to me to get the joint back up and running. Rest, Ice, Elevation and lots of therapy! Books are curiously fascinating to me. I love to read and often go into Barnes and Noble, Borders or Target to just look over the new books. On occasion, I am impulsive and just buy a plethora of new material to have at home when the opportunity arises. A quite moment. A need for escape. Rarely do I actually think of why I end up with the books I adopt. Some have covers that intrigue me. (I have been successful with that technique and also have had very disastrous outcomes.) Or I will read the back to see if the summary will move me. Sometime I will open the book and read a random passage. If I like the writing style or the excerpt I read, I will make the purchase. A drive-by of my previously trusty authors is always a must. I also really appreciate a gifted read. Knowing that my friend probably deems this work something that will reach me in some way. Last year, I got the same book from two people. Maybe that should have been a wake up call to begin reading asap. But with the upcoming Olympics, training and traveling, I never got to it/them. One got packed away in my boxes, heading to storage, during the post-Olympic move. The other, tossed in a bag that ended up piled in the corner of the guest room at my parents house, where I stayed at the beginning of the year. It wasn't until I was heading to Greece to play that I found it and thought maybe I should include it in my travel bag. It was called The Traveler's Gift . Fitting, no?! I had been going through this wrestling match in my head before deciding to play in Greece. The time off had given me a chance to analyse the way I felt about playing. Was I doing it because I loved it? Or just because I have been doing it for the last 9 years? Was there something else I wanted to pursue? Deciding to play in Greece I felt gave me this new opportunity to play in a different atmosphere. New country. New teammates. Different goal. Preparing to go over there, I was training a lot on my own. Swimming, lifting, spinning. Not exciting, but do-able. When I got a chance to play "pick-up" polo with men's club and high school teams.....I would leave giddy. Unable to wipe the smile off my face. At least I knew the polo was still the fun part. That was a step in the right direction. One night in Greece, before we played for the Cup, I was reading late at night. I came across this passage: "Success requires the emotional balance of a committed heart. When confronted with a challenge, the committed heart will search for a solution." It was the first time since college, which was a long time ago, that I found a pen and underlined that section. For days I thought about that. And I committed. Playing water polo was what I wanted to do. It makes me happy. And I will see it through for as long as possible. And this week I found out the path will have a bit of a detour. I slipped on the wall this summer during a swim set. Torquing my knee a bit. I had hoped a bit of rest would eventually help the pain, swelling, and popping to go away. No such luck. An MRI confirmed that I had tears in the back of my knee cap. So some minor arthroscopic surgery will clean it up and I will be back at it again! A closer look at OUR beautiful gold medal!
Today I'm inspired by Moerenuma Park in Sapporo, Japan designed by Isamu Noguchi. The entire park is considered to be a sculpture! What a fun place this would be to have a picnic and take the kids. Look at the variety of facilities here. Have any of you readers been for a visit?(Photo Credits 1 - Nobihaya 2 - Saname777 3 - James King 4 &amp; 6 Elle* :  5: Antsinpants) Have you seen the beautiful looks of Ann Taylor Loft lately? I am a Lucky Magazine Style Shopper, so I was sent a Spring Loft look book and items to peruse and was really charmed. I enjoy the fact that the Loft has wonderfully styled clothing at reasonable price points, especially when they have sales and promotions. I am in love with the girl's bun -- wish I could pull that off.(images from Loft lookbook) Last week I bought the song Sweet Disposition by Temper Trap on itunes and I cannot get it out of my head! What do you think?You may have heard it before, because it was featured in this commercial, this commercial, and this movie. Have you seen the stunning details of Eunice and Daniel's wedding in Martha Stewart Weddings? Eunice is the creative director and co-owner/founder of the specialty letterpress design studio Hello! Lucky -- one of my lovely sponsors, doesn't their day looks so magical! You'll want to peek at more photos at Martha Stewart and Hello Lucky, because there are many more details to see.
I like to think of this theater as the Colosseum's older, neglected brother. Standing on the edge of the Jewish Ghetto, the Teatro Marcello is in great shape. It doesn't have regular opening hours, but they usually hold concerts there in the summer. I've never been, but maybe I'll finally get around to it this year. It was a beautiful day out and I took a bit of a walk in Pigneto to get to know it a bit better and take some photos. I snapped this both because of the way the light was hitting the symmetrical architecture, but also because of the two old men gossiping out of the window on the bottom right. This architecture is a bit of an anomaly in the neighborhood, as most of the buildings are much lower to the ground. A Friday evening in March and this is the scene outside of Sora Margherita, one of the well-known restaurants located in the Jewish Ghetto . I had reservations with friends for 9:30 pm and we still had to wait 20 minutes to get inside the tiny restaurant. Being artichoke season I, of course, started out with the classic carciofo alla giudia . The leaves were crispy and delicious, the inside soft and tender. That was followed by fettucini con sugo alla coda, that was good, but not mind blowing. We definitely had fun and the food was good, but I found the place pricier than it merited, something that happens often to restaurants that are written up in guidebooks and magazines all the time. They try to make these places sound "hidden" and "undiscovered," but as anyone who lives here knows, most often the best places are the ones the press has never heard about, because if you're a local and you really love it, you probably keep it to yourself instead of blabbing to a journalist, for fear that it will be ruined. Last night I headed out to Studio Orizzonte, very close to Piazza Barberini, to an event sponsored by the art and culture magazine Fefe' Project (who is responsible for some of their own street art ). In honor of their tenth issue, they have decided to start an initiative where every two months, two street artists will be asked to "battle" by pasting their works up opposite each other on the huge outside walls of the studio. Fittingly, Sten and Lex were called into battle their studiomate Lucamaleonte in the first exchange. I say fittingly because collectively they're some of the most talented and well-known street artists and Sten and Lex will be opening their first solo show here on Friday. So, who do you think "won" the battle. Too close to call, no? You can check out a new piece by Lucamaleonte next Friday, March 19, at the opening of my next show Street - Walls Experience . I've seen a preview and it's not to be missed! Check out the write up in English on Fefe' Project's website. Ah, The Boxer ....how I love it so! In fact, it's the main reason I came back to the museum . Do you have any idea how rare it is to find something of this size from the ancient world in bronze? 9 times out of 10 the bronze was melted down as some point for use in weapons or newer sculptures, so it's a real treasure to have in the collection. But more than that, I just love his weary expression, bruised and battered, ears cut up, just after a fight with his tape on his hands. Really, it's something that could be seen today, which gives some perspective on how close we really are to our ancient ancestors. And, I've got to confess that the whole time I was editing these photos and writing the blog, I had " The Boxer " by Simon and Garfunkel in my head. Love that song. Tomorrow is the Festa delle Donne , so national museums were free for women this weekend and I took advantage by going to the Museo Nazionale di Roma at Palazzo Massimo. It's a wonderful collection which is rarely frequented by tourists and I'll be doing two posts on my favorite pieces. I should say that the space was revamped a few years ago and is one of the best laid out collections I've seen in Rome. Each room is uncluttered of objects, there are good didactic panels, and the entire collection is accessible due to ramps and elevators (something that can't be taken for granted here). Today's photos show two ancient sculptures depicting "Crouching Aphrodite" and a "Sleeping Hermaphrodite." I love the depiction of the female form in painting and sculpture, the way the curves of the body are shown. And I will always celebrate anything that embraces belly fat rolls as beautiful! The first images are of the Crouching Aphrodite, originally located in Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. It's a Roman copy after a Greek Hellenistic original. The second set of images are of "The Reclining Hermaphrodite," a common theme in ancient Greece and Rome, yet again pointing out that they were probably much more comfortable with different types of sexuality than we are today. From the back she appears as just another beautiful woman, but walk around to the other side of the sculpture and a surprise awaits . Museo Nazionale Romano - Palazzo Massimo alle Terme Via di Villa Peretti, 1 00185 Open Tue-Sun 9 am - 7:45 pm (box office closes 1 hr before) Ticket €7 (valid for entry to all National Museums for a period of 3 days) View Larger Map A new month, a new show! I'm putting on this show with the collective Elsewhere Factory and am really honored by all the great artists who decided to participate. Different images of street art that I photographed around Rome will be paired with original pieces contributed by each of the artists. Check out the press release we prepared below and I hope to see you at the opening on March 19! A unique look at the landscape of urban art interventions in Rome: Friday, March 19 at 7 pm the collective exhibit STREET - Walls Experience will open at Laboratorio51. This wine gallery, located in the heart of San Lorenzo, will play host to the exhibit until March 26. The event is being curated by Elsewhere Factory and Jessica Stewart, who has selected ten of her best street art photographs taken during her continuous documentation of urban art in Rome over the past year. All of the artists shown in the photographs have been asked to display a piece associated with their selected image. Among those participating are French stencil artist C215 , whose works can be seen in New York, San Paolo, New Dehli, and Paris, along with JB ROCK , OMINO71 and MR. KLEVRA , LUCAMALEONTE , HOGRE , URKA , ZILDA , UNO , CURT (from The Stickheads ). During the opening there will be an aperitivo with artiginal beer, wine, and snacks provided by Laboratorio51 and a DJ set by the duo Les Courgettes. "A year ago, wandering through the city in search of material for my blog RomePhotoBlog, I was struck by the huge number of stickers, stencils, and posters that I saw everywhere. My first photographs of street art were taken in San Lorenzo while trying to tell the story of that neighborhood through pictures, and from that moment on I became fascinated with street art and wanted to know more. Now every time I walk down the street, I see something new. After a year documenting every piece of street art I see, I decided to selected ten photographs that I felt were representative of the scene in Rome. There mostly Italians in the bunch, but some from abroad who have left their mark; there are some stencils, some posters. In the end, everyone has left their mark with a huge variety of works that cover most of Rome, in the show you'll see pieces from Pigneto, Monti, Ostiense, Piazza Flaminia, Trastevere, and more. The idea to ask these artists to contribute an original piece to display next to my photograph is to give people the opportunity to see the differences and similarities between each artist's work on the street and in a gallery setting. The show is also my chance to thank all the artists who leave me, and the city, a gift that makes me smile, as walking down the street and spotting one of their pieces is like seeing an old friend."

First Netflix sent me The Man in the Moon instead of Heavy Metal Parking Lot, then they sent me Heavy Metal Parking Lot cracked into three pieces, so I was stuck watching In the Land of Women, which seriously had no point. Adam Brody from the OC plays this kid who writes soft porn movies and gets dumped by his actress girlfriend so he goes to live with his grandmother and gets friendly with the family across the street--the mom (Meg Ryan), a teenage daughter, and a younger, annoyingly precocious and child-actressy daughter. He kisses both the mom and the daughter. Meg Ryan's face looks weird. Adam Brody is all smug. The mom gets cancer. She doesn't die though. But the grandmother does. Nothing else happens! That's the whole stupid movie. Actually, to be honest, I couldn't even make it all the way through. I watched for an  hour and then just read what happened on themoviespoiler.com. And when I found out that nothing happened, I just put it back in its red envelope. Ugh.
Batman has made an impact on my life. I've refereed to him in a few blog posts over the past couple months, but without sharing too much information. I think I am finally ready to talk about him a little bit. He has taught me a lot about my self. He's helped me mature a bit and help define what it is that I am looking for in a life partner. He entered my life in an unexpected manner. I was sitting at a computer in a Sydney Hostel. I saw a friend request on FB. His name sounded familiar, so i accepted his request. We began exchanging emails and finally agreed to a date. The next month was truly a whirwind. We met each others friends, spent a lot of time together, and whenever we were apart all I could do was count the minutes until we would be together again. I do recognize that things moved WAY too quickly in the short time that we were together, but we really connected on many levels. He brought something out of me that NO ONE has ever in a relationship. He helped me feel so good about myself. My self esteem had never been higher, I felt sexy, I was proud of myself, I liked ME for who I already was. I never realized that having someone treat me the way that he did, support me and care for me, would have such a HUGE impact on my life. Let me explain this a little further, in past relationships I had love, care and respect... but I was still somewhat unaffected. Meaning I would still have low self esteem, not like who I was, always trying to figure out what I needed to change about me. I love these past men, but none shook me and looked at me the way that batman did. That is why its is hard for me to let go of him, and unfortunately I do. He's not in the place to be in a relationship, and I really respect the fact that he recognizes this. To me it demonstrates his maturity. He easily could have dragged me along or went through he motions like others have. It was so hard to hear that from him, and he had to say it a few times for me to really get it. But I do finally get it, and he and I are friends today. Its funny how feedback differs from my friends. My male friends (even those who never met him) think very highly of him for being straight and telling me that he cannot date now. This has earned their respect. My female friends, on the other hand, keep encouraging me to move along and forget about him. Its funny how the male and female mind work differently. At first I was devastated... and I do still get sad from time to time. But I think I've finally had a breakthrough. If he was able to make me feel this wonderful, there must be SOMEONE else out there who can also. It may have taken me 33 years to feel this good about myself, I may have to look for 33 more, but I now know that these feelings exist. I've been going on quite a few dates lately, meeting a lot of men, but they sure have large shoes to fill - because batman sure raised the standard a LOT and made this girl incredibly picky. I will not settle, because I now know and understand that I deserve nothing but the best... which is the same for all of you! I have a gym buddy. He's pretty cool. We met at the gym, imagine that. He came into the gym one night and I recognized his face, so we started chatting come to find out not only do we work in the same building, (when I am in the office) but we sit three rows away from each other. At first I thought he was cute and interesting. It was cool getting to know him we even went out on a dates. Then we ended up on the friend shelf. For the first day or two I was a little disappointed, because I was a little interested in him - but this has been for the WAY much better. I have a new male friend. I don't have many of those, but the ones I have are very close to me and I greatly value their roles in my life (Storm Warning and Big Dan) Gym buddy and I have become rather close. We text, IM, talk on the phone all the time. It's pretty cool. He was the one who ran out and bought mace for me when he heard that my friend was raped last week. He knows that I have been really struggling with getting over the last man I dated (batman) and trying to help me get back into the dating world. He is the one who pushed me to get profiles on different dating websites on line, and he's been a cheerleader asking about every guy I've been emailing, texting, talking on the phone with, etc.F Tonight was a bit of a first first. I had a date tonight. or the first time I was nervous, not sure what to wear. Next thing I know gym buddy was giving me tips on my outfit. I felt my phone vibrate over and over throughout the night, just to see that he was checking in on me to make sure I was safe and didn't need an "out." I didn't need an out, I was ok, and I actually had a good time tonight. In all honesty it did not stop me from thinking about batman... but I was distracted for a little while. On my way home I checked in with gym buddy, he grilled me for all the scoop, for him to finally to tell me that he needed to get to bed because he was waiting up, worried for me. It's nice to feel special and important. I'm glad to have this guy as a new friend. I have a few more first dates lined up over the next few days. I'm not expecting a whole lot at this time, since I am not even sure I am in the right place to date, but its a step in the right direction for me, and it feels great having a cheerleader by my side. Southern Cross (Words &amp; music by Stephen Stills, Richard Curtis and Michael Curtis) Got out of town on a boat goin' to Southern islands. Sailing a reach before a followin' sea. She was makin' for the trades on the outside, And the downhill run to Papeete. Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas. We got eighty feet of'a waterline. Nicely making way. In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you. But on a midnight watch I realized Why twice you ran away. Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me larger voices callin'. What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten. I have been around the world, Lookin' for that woman/girl, Who knows love can endure. And you know it will. When you see the Southern Cross for the first time You understand now why you came this way. 'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small. But it's as big as the promise - The promise of a comin' day. So I'm sailing for tomorrow - My dreams are a dyin'. And my love is an anchor tied to you - Tied with a silver chain. I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin' She is all that I have left - And music is her name. Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me larger voices callin'. What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten. I have been around the world, Lookin' for that woman/girl Who knows what love endures. And you know she knows. And you know she knows. So we cheated and we lied and we tested. And we never failed to fail; it was the easiest thing to do. You will survive being bested. Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you In the Southern Cross. -BTW I totally flew over Papeete when I went to NZ This week a few life-shaking things occurred to me and some friends. Two friends had medically-related scares with a parent. I had my job threatened for about 24 hours. Lastly, and most horribly, a friend was mugged and raped in her own home. What a week. with everything that has been going on, I hope the universe starts smiling down on a few people. I know that after all these things have happened, I am looking at my life a little differently and trying to make wiser decisions. I know that I've referenced my debt a few times before. It's not THAT bad compared to others, but its more then I should have. First priority it to pay all credit cards off by end of the year. That is totally feasible. I really need to do that in case anything were to happen to my job - unemployment won't cover everything right now. This means some sacrifice - but it will be worth it. No extravagant traveling for me this year. IN FACT, my next goal, once the cards are paid off, is to save up for my trips... instead of putting myself back in debt with them. Something I should have been doing a long time ago. Next I do want to look into some type of self-defense classes. I've thought about them in the past, but now, after what happened to my friend... I feel more of an urge to take them. Also a friend of mine has been on my case, telling me to carry mace, especially since I am out there dating... I told him last night I'd take him up on that offer for him to buy me some. Scary stuff - but I can't be naive about it. Life it too short and too precious to live with blindfolds on. I must prepare for the best of my ability, and then let the universe deal its course. Everyone please keep my friend in your thoughts, she needs strength to pull through it. Also hope that the bastard who did that to her is caught. On the good note, one of my dearest friends is going to be having her baby soon. I was able to catch up with her a bit last night, and it dawned on us that the next time we see each other, she will be a mama. Still makes me wonder (and hope) that one day it will be my turn. (ok, you can pick those jaws up off the ground now - LOL) That is what I am doing. I believe that right now I am the healthiest and strongest I have been in my entire life... that is from a mental health standpoint. I'm getting back into dating. I reallt don't have the best track record. In the past I'd meet someone and just let myself take that plunge. That can be good and fun, but I've learned that I don't really get to know a person all to well. We all know that a relationship can't be built on passion and chemistry alone. So I've been putting myself back out there. I've got a profile on a dating website. I've been meeting men while out and about. I've even been on a few dates, shared some emails, phone calls, texts. This time it seems different, I am trying to not put so much pressure on myself. I am trying to meet these men, get to know them a little better... then if any of them really catch my eye - then pursue the dating thing. This is a new concept for me. it's tough though. First of all there are a LOT of weirdos out there. There are men who are looking just for sex... and if that's the case, move along! I've had one particular man email me TWICE and comment how my combination of curves and brains must be hot to the touch... No thanks buddy, I'm all set there. The one thing that I am currently struggling with, is that when I realize that someone is not what I am looking for - and its time to start all over again, it makes me miss some men from my past. Yes, these relationships may not have been made to last, but I sure still miss some of them and how they made me smile. Just a footnote to my last post. This person who I was referring to is not a blog reader, so please, no one worry that I might be snipping anyone ties. Thank you all for the great feedback. I'm digesting it all and trying to figure out my next steps. How does one tell a person that they don't want to be friends with them? This woman I met through mutual friends seems to think that I am her new BFF. I am polite to her, we've hung out a little bit, but she seems to be always calling me, emailing me, asking me to make plans. She's a decent person, but she comes with SO MUCH FREAKING DRAMA. I understand that we all have to go through things and learn from our mistakes... but she's consistently asking me for advise when she really has no intentions of doing anything about it. She's clearly seeking attention and drama. I've previously cut people out of my life because they are too much. But I am not sure how to do this with her, since we share the same circle of friends... ..well, this is going to sound bad.. but some of the people in this circle don't like her either. Often people will make plans and specifically say "don't tell so-and-so" I feel like I am in high school or something. I pride myself on my communication skills - I don't often shy from confrontational skills.. but the idea of this one bothers me. I don't want to just disregard her... but maybe if I just remain someone cool to her, she will eventually get the hint. My Nevis song. This song seems to get me through the hardest times of my life at this time. My Nevis song is the song that came on as I was about to jump from the 3rd largest bunjy in the world. I was terrified, I cried, I did not think I could do it...Then logic and reasoning took over and I took that plunge. When I heard that song before I jumped, I thought of my friends, in fact one particular friend. My god that was the scarriest and hardest thing I did in my life... until that time. Little did I realize that life would keep handing me these challenges and try to keep kicking me while I was down. F you. I WON'T be taken down. I am better then any of that. I find that now, whenever I am facing a challenging situation I BLARE that song at top volume and remind myself that I am in control of my own destiny. I may do reckless things like drive like a maniac or whatever... while I am in an emotional state, but I am sick of other people dictating how I am feeling. I live for myself... I am strong enough to deal with what may come my way... I am better then that. I deserve to have it all, and I will fight for it, and I am worth it. F you world. I am in charge of me and I deserve nothing but the best.
This hive started from a swarm I collected several years ago. It has always been a strong hive and has a fierce independence about it. I wasn't sure how well they were doing when I opened the hive today for the first time and saw all these dead SHBs on the tops of the bars. We have had a cold, cold end of February and I imagine they couldn't live through the weather.This is the first year of my five beekeeping years that I am still seeing live SHBs in the hives. Usually they all die off during the winter and then reappear at the end of June. But they are alive in both of my hives - not a lot - the bees are managing them - but they are there.
Elegance is a comfortaqble, cdlassic, sturdily built gaff-rigged ketch - an ideal boat for leisurely cruising. The cheeky little boat on the near side of the jetty actually folds flat and can be carried away in one hand; it is light and strong, will take two people and can be slung from davits at Elegance's stern.  Well, no prizes for guessing where I spent the weekend. My son Etienne is engaged on a series of experiments with the strangest boats, dinghies and speed-on-the-water sailing machines. This odd one, with a sampan type sail and "training wheels" (to save him from frequent involuntary swims) was quicker and more comfortable than it looks! Tomorrow I'll show a very elegant invention, a boat that folds flat and can be carried in one hand...  Yes, that's Alice, with three admirers, on the threshhold of Aurora's notional air strip. Unfortunately Alice is parked in her hangar at present because her owner - one of the three admirers - is away on a short contract in Zimbabwe. I miss seeing her all wrapped up in protective clothing and tied down, on the edge of the strip, or saying a cheerful "good morning" overhead. One of the nicest things about Aurora is that there are a couple of people here who own aeroplanes or microlights, or both, and sail joyfully overhead bringing the wonder of flight to a place not long out of ox-wagons.  When the Fisheries Museum moved from Hout Bay to Laaiplek this specimen had been identified as a fossilised dolphin snout but a recent visitor
I am a little out of my scrapping groove so this one is a bit of a "meh". I was inspired by the new LPS set {Apple Lily} when making this one of a close-up shot of C.

As you can imagine, I don't really have the capacity to reply since dwelling on my life does tend to get me a little over-wrought (how much Sinead O'Connor, Tracy Chapman and Alanis Morrisette can one woman listen to?). I do want to acknowledge that I have saved all your e-mails in a folder on my hard drive so when I need a little extra resolve, I can go back and re-read what you wrote. The fact that so many of you (especially from readers I never heard from before) took time out of your day to message me does my heart such good now...my gratitude is yours.
to the museum says it's not that at all. Any curious archaeologists out there? I'd be glad to have a comment. Well, a garden in a dry climate, anyway! Aurora is having the hottest spell I can remember, so the sound of trickling water is a boon.  70 years ago our horses were ridden in the course of farming operations. My own horse, a grey military remount of 16 hands, with a mouth like iron and a will to match, would take me around the farm boundary, or be harnessed in a Cape Cart (fuel was scarce and rationed.) He also considered himself part of the family and would join us on the stoep looking for handouts. Today, if you want a ride at all,you pay an expensive riding school for the privilege of a mild canter around a limited area, trying to ignore the city in the distance, on a horse that is groomed and trained by others. Except for a few fortunate farmers in this area, who happily keep alive the traditions of gymkhana and distance events, and occasional week-long outrides.  Sadie again, on my son's boat Elegance, this time awake, alert, and waiting for the next instruction from Dickie, her owner, who is the centre of Sadie's universe.  Sadie is one of the dogs who lives next door to the cat on yesterday's post. She was a "Rescue dog", but her rescuer is someone who is one of those gifted people, often referred to as "horse whisperers" - so she has what seems an uncanny understanding of what is said to her, and appears to be trained not just in the conventional sense but far
Hi everyone, My apologies for the sudden vanishing act. I am still only semi back, I think. My friend Nate came and spent several hours yesterday evening and got the computer so at least I could get the Explorer browser running. Things are still kind of messed up, though, so I'm not sure how long this will last or if I'll be able to do more than pretty basic functions. Having trouble with visual stuff and not able to get things to download. It's all frustrating and aggravating. I was lucky that SKYPE and AIM kept working so I was able to get my niece to post the notice that I wasn't able to post... so at least I didn't just vanish. Anyway, I'll be around this morning to check out people's contributions and will see if I can catch up and write my own. Meanwhile, so it doesn't get forgotten, here are some words for next week. The first eight words in the 10-word list have a history. Ten years ago a friend of mine who lives in Greece (Hi Viviane!) sent me a list of words. She has been having computer problems too and during her crisis started sorting through papers - she has printed out a lot of stuff - and came across the words and what I'd written. She challenged me to use them again and then she'd compare what I wrote now 10 years later to what I wrote then. So I thought I'd use them for our Saturday challenge and add a few more. So... Next week's 10-word challenge: culture, sheep, skin, mentally, box, desert, several people, church, Greece, thirst, Next week's mini challenge: swimming pool, cargo, czar, focus, fine Here's a quick stab at a mega for this week... Pluto, the labrador, was champing at the bit to explore all the wonders of the beach. There was that cool slimy seaweed and the starfish and that soggy thing full of matches that smelled really interesting. His human had no sense of adventure these days. She was always worrying about him doing something called " upsetting the apple cart " (he had done that once quite literally at the farmer's market and it was apparently a chapter in his life that he would never be allowed to live down. Even though his person had helped to get it upright again and had given the person some paper stuff, someone had nicknamed him Pesticide Pluto - a farmer joke, they said - and eventually, the human had stopped taking him along when she went there. But the beach... it was a puppy's paradise and he couldn't understand his human's reluctance to let him loose to explore. These days she seemed more uptight than usual. She was struggling with something called depression and her moods were unpredictable . Plus she seemed sometimes more unsteady than she used to be when she walked and he had heard her talking to a friend about something called liver spots . They had sounded very upset. It worried him. These days she mostly sat on the sofa in her plaid robe and slippers with a channel changer in her hand, so he was grateful that they were at least out together on an adventure. He looked back at her sitting in the sand and saw something in her demeanor that made him pause. Exploring could wait. And despite the wonders around him, he curled up quietly beside her and nuzzled against her, licking a tear from her cheek. At that she smiled and her face looked peaceful for the first time in days. Thanks, Plu. You keep me going, you know. I love you, you silly overgrown rascal. You give me joy as well as love. Thanks. I HOPE... hope, hope hope,... that I'll see you all next week. I'll try to get around to read the posts from those of you who posted even without me. Sort of late for this, but I'll put Mr. Linky up in case anyone wants to use him: DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR NAME TO MR. LINKY!!!!! There's a good chance I won't be posting wordzzles for a bit. I am currently cyber deprived. As soon as I am up and running, I will post. Be back soon. In the best of all possible worlds, health care reform would mean universal coverage - a system like Canada or France. This not being the best of all possible worlds, I think we should at least take what we can get. Imperfect reform is still reform. The following came in my email from the White House. I thought it was worth sharing... Good afternoon, $1,115 -- that's the average monthly premium for employer-sponsored family coverage in 2009. Annually, that amounts to $13,375, or roughly the yearly income of someone working a minimum wage job. 1 It gets worse: a recent survey found that if we do nothing, over the next ten years, out-of-pocket expenses for Americans with health insurance could increase 35 percent in every state in the country. 2 In an effort to put the past year's debate over health insurance reform into perspective, we're launching "Health Reform by the Numbers," an online campaign using key figures, like $1,115, to raise awareness about why we can't wait any longer for reform. We'll be sending out a new number every day. Learn what you can do to help spread the word: $1,115 is more money than what many Americans pay for rent or mortgage. But there's more to the problem than just numbers. Take Leslie Banks, an American mom with a daughter in college. In January of this year, she received a notice from her health insurance provider that her plan was being dropped. To keep the same benefits, the premiums for her and her daughter would more than double. Leslie was told by the insurance company that there was nothing she could do -- it was an across-the-board premium hike. If she paid the same monthly premium amount as before, the deductible would increase from $500 to $5,000, and she and her daughter would no longer have preventive care or prescription coverage. Yesterday, Leslie introduced President Obama at a health reform event in Pennsylvania. Check out what they had to say. It's important to raise awareness about numbers like $1,115 and stories like Leslie’s because skyrocketing health care costs impact all of us. So take a moment to forward this email to your family, friends and online networks. With all of us working together, we'll send the message loud and clear -- the time is now for health insurance reform. It's time we made our health care system work for American families and small businesses, not just insurance companies. Let's get it done. Nancy-Ann DeParle Director, White House Office of Health Reform As I've said before, I don't get people's resistance to universal coverage. Massachussetts has a program similar to what the White House has proposed and it is apparently working quite well, the Republican Governor of the state opposes offering the rest of the country desperately needed help. One has to wonder if this is concern for the country or politics. Well, one doesn't really have to wonder, the answer is pretty obvious. I read recently that Sarah Palin used to go across the border to get health care for her family. You know that horrible socialist country to our north where she didn't have to pay for care. Hmmm. Another great reason to support Health Care reform is that Rush Limbaugh has threatened to leave the country and move to Costa Rica (which has universal health coverage) if health care passes. Would that the man ever spoke the truth. When he got sick in Hawaii a few months back, he raved about his care until he discovered that Hawaii has had universal coverage for its citizens for 40 years! The biggest reasons as far as I'm concerned, though - are human decency. What kind of nation are we if we let our own citizens suffer and die needlessly, when we don't make sure that every pregnant women gets the best possible care. There's also the common sense reason. While there may be short-term costs to reform, there are long-term savings... in money and in lives. I bought new windows for my house a while back. I had to accrue debt to do it, spend money I couldn't afford. Do I regret the decision? Not for a second. My quality of life has improved enormously, I'm saving on heating costs and the environment is benefiting too. I don't know if this analogy works, but I'm going to try it. The current state of health care - the uninsured, the outrageous costs - are like a cancerous tumor slowly killing the nation's people and it's economy. We can keep postponing surgery and see our people and our economy die while we wait - or we can take action, even imperfect action. Maybe we'll need additonal surgery. We'll be alive to have it. Sometimes you have to spend to save. Sometimes you spend because its necessary. Our current health care system has left many bankrupt or in crippling debt, even those who thought they were insured. That's just destructive of individual lives and of the nation's economic well-being. Lastly, I guess, it's simply not right for so many people to live without access to health care. We are our brother's (and sister's) keepers. It's true that if we don't hang together we will all hang separately. If we don't hang together way too many of us will die separately, needlessly in pain and in poverty. That's just wrong. Guess that's all I have to say. Not sure how coherent it is, but... This is week 102 of the Saturday Wordzzle Challenge. Anyone new to the process can refer back here to find out how it works. My list of mistake this week is overwhelming. SOOO sorry. Am I wrong or was pregnant on our list recently I try not to repeat words and phrases but sometimes I slip up. Sorry. Sorry too about food cream... and the fact that unlike a couple of weeks ago when there were 9 words, this time there are apparently 11. Agggghhhh! I have no idea what food cream is, how it got there, or what I was thinking. Probably meant whipped cream. And I spelled Hershey wrong. Clearly it wasn't a good week here in Hancock. Maybe they should start preparing my room at "the Home." Participation seems to have dropped off significantly of late but I plan to keep going for a while and reassess the situation at some point down the line. I would like some feedback from everyone about taking "Saturday" out of the equation since quite a few folks are having trouble making the Saturday deadline. It never really was a deadline in my mind, it's just back when I started the Wordzzle Challenge, I was posting daily or close to daily and so I picked Saturday for this challenge. If people would prefer it, we can change it (except for the logo which I'm too lazy at the moment to revise) to the WEEKLY wordzzle challenge and people can just post whenever they are ready. I'd still post mine on Friday evening as I've been doing. Let me know what you think. This week's words were: smoothness, sugar daddy, page, Copernicus, liquid, craggy, trapezoid, milquetoast, blizzard, food cream, dental problems For the mini: Hershey kisses, pregnant, scarring, cadet, grist mill My mini: Cadet Wanda Walker sat on her bunk and cried. She couldn't believe she was pregnant . How had this happened? One romantic dinner at the Grist Mill Inn with Max and her career was ruined. She had been worried by the occasional bouts of nausea but when she started craving Hershey Kisses , she knew... Now she would have to leave the army, the career that she loved. She knew that she carried deep emotional scarring from her own childhood as an army brat and she would not let that happen to her baby girl (she knew somehow that she was having a girl). She didn't know how Steve would feel about things, but she guessed she had to tell him. With or without him, though, this child would be loved and have a stable safe life. She would make sure of it. The mega: What on earth is food cream ??? Who made up these words? Didn't she proof read? I have no idea what I was thinking... obviously I WASN'T thinking. The grist mill of my brain had ground to a halt, wasn't functioning... major snafu. Sigh. Anyway... here's a bit of nonsense with for the rest of the words (which were also pretty awful). I wish I had a sugar daddy named Copernicus Trapezoid Jones. He'd have a craggy , handsome features, beautiful liquid brown eyes you could drown in, an urbane smoothness (not creepy or fake, just a natural easy charm), a wry but gentle wit, and piles of money. No dental problems , no major scarring (though I really don't care about that a bit... just have to get rid of the word). A gorgeous smile. We'd be on the same page politically. He wouldn't be a milquetoast , but he'd be agreeable. I'd win most of our arguments because he'd be persuaded by my thoughtful intelligence. Our days would be pregnant with laughter and inspiration. We'd write books together. On those days when I'm down or feeling like a space cadet , he'd hold my hand and see me through. And during Hancock's winter blizzards , we'd snuggle together and sip hot chocolate or nibble Hershey kisses. I'd like that. So Copernicus Jones, if you're out there.... I'm waiting. The 10-word: Copernicus Jones was considered by some to be almost too perfect. Men who were jealous called him - erroneously - a Harvey Milquetoast . He never much cared what people thought. Considering how perfect he was, he was remarkably modest and self-effacing. He'd had a trapezoid shaped face, handsome " craggy " features, skin that was reputed to have the smoothness of silk, and huge, liquid brown eyes that positively oozed with intelligence, humor and compassion. He'd never had a dental problem in his life. At age 58, his teeth were still perfect. His smile was reputed to make women swoon. When he had - in a moment of loneliness, because amazingly Copernicus Jones was lonely - listed himself on one of those e-harmony type websites, his email had been overwhelmed with a positive blizzard of responses. He'd had to take down his Facebook page because it too had been overwhelmed with admiring fans and women hoping for a handsome sugar daddy to buy them whatever they fancied. (Yes, Copernicus J was filthy rich too.) He'd responded to one woman because he was curious about her email address which was angel foodcream @... etc. She had turned out to be a touch crazy and he had given up on the idea of love and companionship. Then last night he'd had a strange dream in which a laughing raven had been calling out his name... When he woke up he had a feeling that maybe there was hope for him yet. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Words for next week's 10-word challenge are : slimy, Pluto, champing at the bit, peaceful, chapter, upright, depression, starfish, matches, channel changer For the mini: liver spots, pesticide, plaid, unpredictable, upsetting the apple cart Thanks for playing. For those who are new, here are some guidelines to make the process more fun. Enjoy! See you next week! DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR NAME TO MR. LINKY!!!!! Very interesting... The young woman who has started this movement makes wonderful good sense. I hope people listen to her. The last guy is a libertarian (not my cup of tea or coffee, but he's very interesting and thoughtful). This is week 101 of the Saturday Wordzzle Challenge. Anyone new to the process can refer back here to find out how it works. For anyone new to wordzzles, the words for this week's mini are a memorial of sorts for our wordzzle/blogger friend Dr. John Linna who died last week. He will be missed. ~~~ I wanted to share two things this week. We had two very late posts last week. One was from Stephen in AZ who shared that he has been posting late because he has not been feeling well. Maybe we can all send our prayers and good thought to him. I also - even though I don't like to play favorites - wanted to recommend that you stop by last week's other late post. Gabrielle wrote something truly wonderful using the words from 2 weeks ago and I'd hate for everyone to miss it. ~~~ This week's words were: smoothness, crafty, purchase, brief, chirping, forever, shift, moonrise, lampshade, stereotype For the mini: remembrance, Dr. John, Agent 012, dragons, Fortress My mini: The dragons , led by the noble Fandango, had gathered en masse at the Fortress of Remembrance . Many were weeping unabashedly, something that Dragons seldom do even in the most dire of circumstances, but they had lost a great friend - a human - but a great friend, none-the-less. Dr. John Linna - whom they affectionately called Agent 012 - had offered friendship and had become a spokesperson of sorts for the Dragon community, greatly improving human-dragon relations. They had enjoyed his wit and his kindness and his generosi
y to his fellow humans and to the dragons. He would be written up (and remembered orally), they all agreed, in Dragon Lore. For today, they would collect their tears and put them into a crystal bottle, which Fandago himself would deliver to Dr. John's beloved wife Betty and to his children. Dragon's tears were reputed to have legendary healing powers because they were rare and made of love. Fandango wished they were as healing to dragons as they were to humans because he thought perhaps his heart had broken. Of all the treasures he had amassed over the centuries, his friendship with Dr. John was perhaps the one he held most precious. He knew that friends like Dr. John never really leave us. They stay in our hearts and our memories, but memory was different than life and though he was now enshrined in the Fortress of Memory, thing would never be the same. My 10-word: Samson could not believe that the crafty merchant had gotten him to purchase ten cases of Moonrise Moonshine, but apparently he had. The last thing Samson remembered was being told about its smoothness and the words "just have a taste." A couple of sips later it felt as though the earth had shifted and after that he had a brief and very vague recollection of dancing with a lampshade on his head (could it be he had done something that was so sterotypical ?). This morning with a headache/hangover that made the sweet chirping of birds sound more like thunder, he thought perhaps he would give up drinking forever . My mega: The dragons had invited Raven to attend the ceremony at the Fortress of Remembrance for their friend Dr. John or Agent 012 as they had liked to call him. She had been more than a bit uneasy about the idea of attending a moonrise gathering of dragons but now she was glad she had decided to go. The the sight and sound of dragons weeping was something she would remember forever . It certainly shifted her existing stereotype of them as crafty , dangerous and cynical creatures. The memorial ceremony itself had been brief . The leader of the dragons - a dragon with a name like Tango or something like that - had appeared carrying what had (at first glance) appeared to her to be a lampshade. Fandango - that was the name - had later explained that it was a crystal container in which they would collect their tears to offer as a gift to the family. Anyway, Fandango had appeared, said something in a language which sounded oddly (especially given the massive size of dragons) like chirping except that there was a depth and smoothness to the tonality that was simultaneously moving and consoling and she found herself wishing she could purchase a recording of the sound for times when life was too much. She wished she could have brought her camera too record the occasion, but it had been expressly forbidden. She would have to remember it in her heart, along with Dr. John and so many other wonderful souls who had crossed through her life as she traversed this world. She asked if she could add some of her own tears to the dragons vial and they graciously allowed her to do so. It was not much, but it was all she had to offer. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Words for next week's 10-word challenge are : sugar daddy, page, Copernicus, liquid, craggy, trapezoid, milquetoast, blizzard, food cream, dental problems For the mini: Hersey kisses, pregnant, scarring, cadet, grist mill Thanks for playing. For those who are new, here are some guidelines to make the process more fun. Enjoy! See you next week! DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR NAME TO MR. LINKY!!!!! This is in two parts. Worth listening to. I have been where Olberman is now with his dying father. It is not an easy place to be. I wish there had been "death panel" discussions to help me through. Lucky for me, my parents and I had talked some about it and I had Dr. Jim. Not everyone has that. This is week 100 of the Saturday Wordzzle Challenge. Anyone new to the process can refer back here to find out how it works. This week's words were stinkers... Sorry about that... and for miscounting. I try not to edit what comes to me unless I'm hungry or something like that and french fries, ketchup and cheeseburger all come at once... wouldn't be any fun if there were NO challenge... ~~~~~~ As many of you know, Dr. John, who has been with us almost from the onset of this Wordzzle meme, died early this week and will not be here to celebrate our 100 week milestone. I know many of us are going to miss Dr. John, Agent 012, Fandago, and all the other imaginative characters that sprang from this good man's head, not to mention his support and comments. Anyone wishing to offer thoughts of consolation to his wife Betty can find her here . I have made next week's mini challenge a tribute of sorts to John's memory. ~~~~~~ This week's words were: transfixed, treachery, basics, fragrance, sampler, pregnant, cartoons, lark, spartan and for the mini: rapid, camping, blandishments, transitory, plug-ins My 10-(well 9 this week) word: Alexander Spartan stood transfixed by the beauty of his pregnant wife and devastated by her treachery . He loved everything about her - she was a sampler of wonders from the fragrance her body gave off as she entered a room to the basics of her beauty and intelligence. But at the moment he felt like one of those cartoon characters who has been hit on the head and stands with a flock of little larks circling. Was the baby, he wondered, his? The mega: The rapid clarity with which Lucinda realized that camping was not even slightly romantic quickly translated itself into a sense of deep betrayal. While she had not expected a plethora what one might call plug-ins , still, she had not expected anything quite this Spartan and she was not, as they say, a happy camper. Not happy at all. Doesn't he know by now that I'm not some kind of "back t0 basics girl" she wondered to herself, growing increasingly irritated by the treachery of being lured into this hell with promises of blandishments like transfixing vistas, deer, butterflies, and a sampler of beautiful flowers to uplift her soul, not to mention starlight and a crackling fire. Instead there were ants, rain and the distinct fragrance not of flowers and fresh air but of skunk. It was like being in a bad cartoon from which she couldn't wake up. She wished it was a cartoon. She would club Fred over the head and then for an extra lark she would pour honey on him and stake him over an ant hole. Watching her face, her husband knew that he was in deep trouble and that her mood was not likely to be transitory unless there was some kind of major miracle. "Honey love," he said finally and when - after an extremely pregnant pause - she acknowledged him - he continued on... what would you say to me taking you to that motel we passed a couple of miles down the road and.... but he was unable to go any further since his she had transformed back into his beloved wife and thrown herself into his arms with the words... "and you must promise me that we will never ever ever ever go camping again ... " And the mini: The transitory satisfaction the promised blandishments of various plug-ins brought to their eager downloaders was rather like the rapid realization for the inexperienced that camping was not all starry skies and bunnies, but also included ants, skunks and poison ivy. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Words for next week's 10-word challenge are : smoothness, crafty, purchase, brief, chirping, forever, shift, moonrise, lampshade, stereotype For the mini: remembrance, Dr. John, Agent 012, dragons, Fortress Thanks for playing. For those who are new, here are some guidelines to make the process more fun. Enjoy! See you next week! DON'T FORGET TO ADD YOUR NAME TO MR. LINKY!!!!!
Debut Author of the Month: Kristina Springer ... "I probably always knew in the back of my mind that I wanted to be a writer," Kristina Springer says in the long version of her bio on kristinaspringer.com . "But, it didn’t hit me really hard until about 10 years ago." After years of reading and writing (technical, TV, and a little bad poetry), Kristina began writing young adult fiction in earnest. Her debut novel THE ESPRESSOLOGIST was published by FSG in October 2009. "The publishing process for THE ESPRESSOLOGIST was so great-- every step along the way was fun from the first line edits through getting the final cover. I finally found exactly what I want to do and it's an awesome, awesome thing." Tell my readers about your debut b ook THE ESPRESSOLOGIST . THE ESPRESSOLOGIST is about Jane, a 17-yr old part-time coffee barista at a Chicago coffee house. Jane has a notebook where she's been recording what type of drinks people order and she notices a trend--the same type of people always order the same type of drinks. One day she tries to match up a customer whose favorite drink is an iced vanilla latte with another whose drink is a dry cappuccino and they're a hit. She tries it a couple more times, with success, and then her boss finds out what she's been doing and turns her into the store's holiday promotion, causing a love and latte craze. You wrote the entire manuscript for your book from the same table at your local Starbucks. Is the Starbucks culture conducive to writing non-coffee-themed books, too? Oh yeah. I'm on book #8 now and I've written all of them in coffee shops. Though, I have been fancying Caribou lately--I can't lie. You had offers of representation from two agents and then your first book went to auction. How did you get to that point? Mostly just let rejections roll of my back and kept on going! I was inching toward the 100 agents queried mark with my first YA book (I've since buried that book. RIP Book #1) while writing THE ESPRESSOLOGIST . I felt really good about THE ESPRESSOLOGIST and was so excited to start querying it. Once I did, things happened really fast. Suddenly there were a number of agents reading it, two offered, and then maybe a week or so after I signed with one of the agents the first offer from a publisher came in. There were more interested publishers so my agent set up an auction. It was all very exciting! You have four kids under 7. How do you juggle life and writing life (and don’t say lots of coffee). I won't say coffee (but it helps!). It is a bit of a struggle. OK, it can be a lot of a struggle some days but I manage to pull it off. Basically, the kids can get loud and cranky so I always attend to their needs first. But if there is a moment that I can sneak to the laptop and post a blog here and there I'll take it. If an idea for a chapter I'm working on hits me I'll write it down anywhere I can. Of course then my notes end up in e-mail drafts and on post-its/receipts/mail/kids' homework/you name it. I do all business calls between 1 and 2 PM (a.k.a. naptime at the Springer house). And I write after the kids go to bed. Usually my husband will get home from work at this time and I can make a dash for the coffeeshop to write. I do promotional type stuff (signings, panels etc.) primarily on the weekends when my husband can take over with the kids. THE ESPRESSOLOGIST has been out for several months. What have you done in the way of promotion? Online presence? How is it going? I do as much as I can! Online I blog/ tweet /facebook a lot. I'm at kristinaspringer.blogspot.com and I also blog with a great group of writers at author2author.blogspot.com . Our group posts five days a week so we're very active. I've tried a couple of ads on various sites and I've done lots of giveaways. It's especially nice to group up with other authors for giveaways too, Like Kristin Walker ( A MATCH MADE IN HIGH SCHOOL ) and Rhonda Stapleton ( STUPID CUPID ) and I did a fun one for Valentine's Day. We asked people to write us a poem and we picked a random winner to receive an autographed copy of each of our books, candy, and handmade Valentine cards. In person I go to as many events as I can. I've done a number of signings, a YA panel, the yearly Anderson's Children's literature breakfast, an author fair, and a school visit so far. I have a teacher's appreciation luncheon coming up this weekend and another author fair right after that so I try to keep busy on the weekends. I don’t drink coffee. Does it make sense that I’d marry a Jewish psychologist who’s a java junkie? No. That makes no sense whatsoever. Um, maybe it's an opposites attract thing? Perhaps you've yet to succumb to the delicious addiction and you'll eventually pick it up? I wouldn't eat salad until I was like 18 and now I love it. Maybe you'll come around. How many reviewers have called your book “frothy”? Too many to count! I've seen lots of "cute," "sweet," "frothy" and lots of people talking about reading it while getting cozy by fireplaces/christmas trees/with a blanket/whatever else you like to get cozy by or with. I totally love that people get that from the book because that's what I was going for--the warm fuzzies. Tell us about your second novel that will be published by FGS later this year. I am insanely excited about my new book! It's called MY FAKE BOYFRIEND IS BETTER THAN YOURS. It's about two 7th grade BFFs who each think each other's "boyfriend" is a fake. It becomes competitive (like if one says her boyfriend sent her carnations the other says her boyfriend sent her roses) and hilarious. It will be out in the August 31st. Finally, can you offer some advice to other debut authors? To those pursuing publication? To other debut authors: Don't read the reviews! Ok, I know you'll read some of the reviews-- especially from the bigger reviewers. But don't read ALL of the reviews. Like all the goodreads and Amazon and random reviews that pop up online everyday. People's opinions vary so widely and if you start reading everything you might let it affect your thinking and possibly your writing. One person may say OMG, this is the BEST BOOK EVER!! Um, no it's not. And another might say OMG, this is the worst thing ever written! Again, not. It's better to not obsess over what everyone is saying and just work on your next book. To those pursuing publication: Don't give up! You'll be rejected. A LOT. But you can't let it stop you! You need to believe in your work and keep on trying. A Catching Up Post... Hopefully you've missed me, dear readers. My blog has been quiet for a bit as I was home in bed for a week taking Vicodin and watching Law &amp; Order reruns with frozen edamame in my pants. And one should not post in that state. But I'm back at work now, almost all better and pretty much caught up on my work. Now to catch you up... My birthday was a week ago Wednesday, but I rescheduled it due to the situation described above. (So if you asked me, I'll tell you I'm still 41.) I've decided it will officially occur on March 20th, at which time I will be in New York to catch the end of the NYC Teen Author Festival. Click here for the event schedule posted on the readergirlz blog. There's all kinds of stuff going on all over the city, including the World's Biggest Book Signing in the World! at Books of Wonder (where they also sell cupcakes). Look for tweets from me during the events and a post or two when I get back. SCBWI announced their 2010 Golden Kite Award recipients . Their award for fiction went to SEA OF THE DEAD by Julia Durango; nonfiction to ASHLEY BRYAN: W O RDS TO MY LIFE'S SONG by Ashley Bryan; picture book text to THE LONGEST NIGH T b y Marion Dane Bauer (illustrated by Ted Lewin); picture book illustration to GRACIA S THANKS illustrated by John Parra (written by Pat Mora).

This weekend is our first WD Editors' Intensive of 2010. If you can't make it to this one, mark your calendar for September 11-12 when we'll be offering another weekend of information and critiquing featuring yours truly as well as a raft of other awesome WD editors. That's it for now. I'm off to do some interviewing, editing and WRITING (all my favorite fun work stuff). Five Things I Learned from Heather Brewer's Book Signing... I attend a lot of author events because, well, I love to meet authors. Most recently I saw Heather Brewer , author of the best-selling Chronicles of Vladimir Tod series, doing a signing at my local B&amp;N to support the release of book #4 in the series, ELEVENTH GRADE BURNS . This was a particularly fun author event for me (more on that below) and Heather did a terrific job addressing her young (and not so young) audience about her writing career and her books and her characters. Here are a few things we learned: 1) Give yourself permission to write. Not to get all Nike on you, but if you want a career as a writer, it's not going to happen unless you just do it. Although it was something Heather longed for for years, she was told by parents and even her beloved librarians that being an author wasn't really an option and she'd need a "real job." Finally, she said, after her youngest child started school, she discussed her career options with her spouse. What would you do , he asked her, if money didn't matter and you could do whatever you wanted? I want to be an author , she told him. Then do it , he said. (She proceeded to write, find an agent, get a book contract, and hit high on the New York Times Bestseller List.) It's OK to give yourself permission to follow your dream. But if it takes a supportive, encouraging significant other, that's OK too. 2) Goal setting is important. Heather's Brewer's formula: butt + chair = writing. Even when she's on tour she writes 1,000 words a day. Books don't write themselves, after all. So, again, just do it. 3) Mine the painful stuff for material. Heather told the bookstore audience about growing up in a small town where she felt like an outcast and was bullied. (Except when she spent time in the library. "Bullies don't know there is a library," she said.) She calls upon these experiences as she writes her main character, Vladimir Tod. Because, really, who's more of an outcast than a vampire in junior high? Heather Brewer's Chronicles of Vladimir Tod books. 4) Boys read. And they come to author events. There were a lot of them and they were excited. I sat next to kid named Nick who talked my arm off about the books and characters he loved. (I asked him what grade he was in. "Sixth," he told me. Then he looked at me, paused, and said," You're not in any grade, are you?") Another boy raised his hand during the Q&amp;A and when called on he was so nervous he couldn't remember his question. (He did later, then asked several more.) Another boy who seemed kind of shy was in front of me in the singing line. With his head slightly lowered he spent several minutes giving Heather a synopsis of the story he wants to get published (which sounded really cool). These boys love books. 5) Authors are rock stars. OMG. The kids LOVE Heather. Love love love. A heard a few of them say they'd been there for hours because they wanted good seats. A couple of girls with hair dyed unnatural colors said they wanted to high five Heather and never wash their hands again. Four girls drove in from Michigan. (That's far.) One girl took a photo with the author, ran next door to Kinkos and got an 8x10 printed and came back to get it signed. And they were asking questions, thoughtful ones that could have only come from devoted fans. Tons of them wore vampire smiley face apparel. It was the best, most enthusiastic bunch of slightly awkward, slightly pimply, hoodie-wearing tween fans I'd ever seen. I wanted to take them all home with me. But I bet they all wanted to go home with Heather Brewer. Heather Brewer at the signing table. Crawling Out From Under Snowpocalypse &amp; Being Lost in a Good Book... If you don't live around here, I'm sure you've all seen the news of the recent enormous snowfall dumping on hunks of the country. In case you missed them on my Facebook page , here are a few pictures I took through the windows of my warm house, most likely while wearing a Snuggie. Because of the snowiness, I was pretty much stuck in the house for FOUR SOLID DAYS. Me, Katkin, the boy, the elderly cat, and a dwindling supply of cereal and canned goods. But instead of watching the Olympics, I engaged in a few glorious days of all-in reading. A friend recommended Kathryn Stockett 's debut novel THE HELP (note: a book for grown-ups) and once I got into it, I was gone. I neglected my family. I ate very little. I wore pajamas. There was no showering. I read chapters out loud and copied down my favorite lines. And when I finally finished it at 3:15 AM on Monday I sat weeping on my sofa. Sigh. Several times a year I'm completely consumed by a book this way. Nothing exists but me, the characters and their world. And when I read the last page and close the cover, it's as if I'm leaving a lover after a secret weekend in a hotel room. There has been very little sleeping. Scenes linger in my thoughts for weeks. And I wish I could go back and experience it anew. I am now clean, well-rested and back at my desk. I've loaned the book to another friend and ordered her to start reading so we can discuss. And I'm looking forward to the next snowstorm or airplane ride or day when I suddenly have a few hours and a gem. (Your recommendations are welcome.)

DBW, SCBWI, My Webinar &amp; WD Intensives... I've been gone for more than a week, so I've got so much to talk about! DBW &amp; SCBWI I got back from New York last night after attending both Digital Book World and the SCBWI Annual Winter conference. I hope you all were following the tweets ( #dbw , #scbwiny10 ) and the SCBWI Conference Blog . (Mega kudos for my amazing TEAM BLOGgers Jaime , Jolie , Lee and Suzanne .) TEAM BLOG, l to r: Lee Wind, Suzanne Young, Jaime Temairik, me, Jolie Stekly One of the sessions I attended at DBW was on Digital Content and Marketing for the Born-Digital Generation. I wrote about it for DBW so click over to read about the cool and successful things Simon &amp; Schuster, Harper and Scholastic are doing to reach out to their young, tech-savvy audience. Agent Holly Root of Waxman Literary also participated in the panel. She offered this advice to writers: "Reach readers, navigate the changing review landscape, use social media to its fullest." UPCOMING EVENTS If all the DBW and SCBWI conference coverage has you in the mood for an informative event (and you'd like some tips that can help you better follow Holly Root's advice), I've got a couple things coming up that might interest you. First, I'm presenting an hour-long webinar focused on children's publishing called Get Your Children's Writing Published . I gave a similar webinar last year and I was thrilled to see a tweet about it the other day (YAY!): @ lkblackburne Last year, w/ no blog, no twitter account, and no clue, I took @ alicepope 's Children's writing seminar. So worth it. You can get more information and register here. If you've got more than an hour to devote to learning, the Writer's Digest staff is offering one of our popular Editors' Intensives March 13-14. This event offers a day of programming, a one-on-one manuscript critique, and a some solid WD swag. Plus we can only fit a limited number of people in the WD HQ so there's an intimate feel and plenty of opportunity for interaction with WD staff. (You'll get all your questions answered!) You can get more information and register here. A side note: Thanks to everyone for your input on Twitter and Facebook throughout my week of conferencing. I so appreciate your comments, responses and retweets. Alice Has Left the Nati--Follow Me Online... As soon as I post this, I'm leaving the office and heading to the airport to got to New York for Digital Book World and the SCBWI Annual Winter C onferenc
 . But, never fear--you don't have to miss me... Watch my Twitter feed on Tuesday and Wednesday for tweets from DBW (#dbw) and check the DBW blog for daily reports on the event. You can also follow DBW on Twitter . For as-it-happens conference action, stay glued to the Official SCBWI Conference Blog where I and the rest of SCBWI TEAM BLOG will cover the event live. (If you can't join the fun, we'll bring it right to your computer screen!) Here's a rundown of our exclusive pre-conference interviews with SCBWI Winter Conference speakers (as swiped from Jaime's blog): Jolie Stekly featured blogger Jenn Bailey Lee Wind featured Art Director Laurent Linn and agent Eddie Gamarra and author Jacqueline Woodson Suzanne Young featured publisher Ben Schrank Jaime Temairik featured publisher Allyn Johnston and illustrator Peter Sis I interviewed agent Tina Wexler and conference tips from conference-goer Jane Makuch Debut Author of the Month: Libby Schm ais Je suis heureux de vous informer that starting today, I'm reviving le Debut Author du mois feature on mon blog. (Those of you who contacted me for First Books: You may be hearing from in months to come.) January's DAotM is Libby Schmais , whose YA debut is The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein , released from Delacorte en Décembre . Says Kirkus: "readers of any age will savor Lotus’s panache...Chick lit par excellence." You can read a d é licieuse excerpt here . Describe your debut YA novel, The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein . The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein is a diary book by a teenager living in Brooklyn who is obsessed with all things French. Lotus feels stifled by her life in Park Slope, Brooklyn and fancies herself an existentialist, although her real knowledge of that philosophy and actual French words is a little sketchy. She and her best friend Joni end up both liking the same guy, another Sartre aficionado, and things come to a head during a school trip to Montreal, challenging both her friendship and her freethinking ideas. You’d published a couple of books for adults—what made you write for a YA audience? I didn’t consciously set out to write a YA book. The character of Lotus appeared to me one day, and the voice was a teenage one, so I just kind of went with it. I think if I had decided to write a modern-day YA novel from the beginning, I would have been intimidated, because it was out of my comfort zone. Why did you choose diary format? Have you kept journals at some point? Well, Lotus is studying The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan in school, a famous Japanese diary book so that’s part of the reason I chose the diary format. The other reason is that I’ve always wanted to write a diary book. So many of my favorite books are diary books, like I Capture the Castle , Bridget Jones’ Diary , The Diary of Adrian Mole , etc. And in answer to your question, I have tried to write in many journals over the years and have a stack of half-filled notebooks that are impossible to read because my handwriting is so terrible. Like your title character Brooklynite Lotus Lowenstein, are you a Francophile and/or an existentialist? I’m definitely a Francophile. I love French food, speaking French badly, and I have recurring fantasy about moving to the South of France, preferably near a field of lavender and an outdoor café. I’m also a bit of an existentialist, particularly on Mondays, when life seems très meaningless. How did you end up at Delacorte? Do you have an agent? I do have an agent — the fabulous Stephen Barbara of Foundry Media , who hooked me up with Delacorte. I actually have a two-book deal, so I will have another YA book coming out in approximately a year or so, with a totally different character, although equally quirky and misguided. You’ve recently completed the My-Life-Is-Merde-but-Have-a-Bonnes-Fêtes-Anyway Blog Tourapalooza, you’ve got a fan page on facebook , and you blog and tweet as your main character. Did I miss anything? How are your book promotion efforts going? Wow, it sounds so exhausting when you put it like that. Yes, that covers it, except for maybe Goodreads , which is a great site for authors. I have to say all the YA bloggers are a very encouraging and enthusiastic bunch, and they’ve been very positive about the book, so I’d say the online promotion is going well, although I always feel that I could be doing more. Can you offer some advice to first-time YA authors? Advice. Hmmm. Probably the same advice I give myself — try not to be too influenced by what everyone else is doing and write the story that you need to write. And don’t be so hard on yourself. Writing is not easy.
her in search of greasy drunk food: East Village, Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen/Times Square. I still remember the first street gyro I had, in the summer of 2007 in the East Village. Life-changing.Another staple of the food cart family, pictured above, is something I had inexplicably not partaken of until today: the coffee cart. These are all over the city in the mornings, spanning from Harlem to Wall Street. I see one on my walk to the train in the mornings at 103rd and 3rd, and then on my walk from the train to work along virtually every street in Tribeca. This morning I really, really wanted some orange juice - I know, I'm such a hardass - and, remembering I had a few rare dollars in my wallet, I decided to brave the mysterious coffee cart and partake of a New York staple.I felt weirdly nervous as I waited in line, listening to the guy in front of me order a large coffee with two Splendas. The guys behind me, who clearly worked together, were having a conversation about their summer plans, tossing around the prospect of finding other work or maybe leaving the city. As they talked, visions of Coney Island danced in my head: the beach, sun, cool ocean breeze, sand, hot dogs, music, cutoff shorts, swimsuits. I felt warm and happy. The guy in front of me finished ordering and I stepped up to the window. The coffee cart man smiled down at me, and I told him I just wanted an orange juice. He asked me if that was it and I said yes. He told me it would be a dollar and 25 cents.

Today Jordan and I went to a bull sale. I couldn't stop laughing during the auction; the auctioneer was hilarious and it was just like a movie. Jordan's mom was there, which is why we went. We both tried to make Jordan smile for a picture, but he really didn't want to. He likes to pretend he's a serious, grumpy guy. Also, I was definitely the only person there wearing floral ballet flats. This weekend was full of comfort food. I got a cold, so I made lots of food to make myself feel better. The homemade macaroni and cheese was my favorite. Hello, perfect start to my weekend! I get to spend so much time with Jordan now because his spring break starts today. :) Hope you all have a beautiful weekend. Hello my sweets! I have exciting news! I'm opening a vintage housewares shop on Etsy soon! I've always been in love with things that are sweet and a little bit country, like they'd belong in a cabin, and now I'm doing what I love and opening a shop. Hopefully by the middle of next week my shop will be as full and perfect as I'm dreaming, so I'll share the link with you then.&nbsp; In the meantime, here is a sneak peak of some items I love. My sweet Danny cat got sick yesterday, so we spent many hours at the vet's office last night. &nbsp;Since she already had surgery two years ago, I pretty much lost it when the same problems happened yesterday. &nbsp;Thankfully, the vet doesn't think she needs surgery this time, just antibiotics and prescription food. &nbsp;So my poor fat kitty is very tired and sad today, but hopefully will be better soon. Update I got this text this afternoon. It seems like she's doing better! Hi mom. I'm doin good. Today is my turn to take turn in the Blog It Forward Mashup . The idea is to write about what inspires us the most, and for me that is planning. I plan where I will live... ...what my house will look like... ...where I want to travel... ...my wedding someday... ...drives I want to take... ...adventures I will have... ...and the life I want to live. click on photos for image sources &nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's post was by&nbsp; oh, hey great! &nbsp;and tomorrow's post will be by&nbsp; Oh So Beautiful Paper . Please be sure to go check out both of their inspiring posts! Since the weather has been so nice, Jordan and I went down to the river by his house Sunday morning. There is hardly any ice left on the river, which is amazing because it was completely covered when we were there for Christmas. I can't wait for spring so we can finally spend days outside. I took so many pictures of Parker this weekend! My favorites were of him drinking water during lunch; first he loved it, then he really hated it. P.S. Aren't his cheeks so adorable?! I just wanted to cuddle him all day. P.P.S. I may have been a little selfish and held him way more than everyone else. Sorry! (I'm not really that sorry, though.)
foreground: snow background: daffodil sprouts! c elebrations are few and far between after valentine's day and before easter. oh sure, there's saint patrick's day but, other than the wearin' o' the green, it's not such a big deal around here. s o in an effort to liven up midwinter, when the girl was little we started celebrating her half birthday. i'd make half a cake, give her half a birthday card, sing half the birthday song... just enough frivolity to make an otherwise drab ordinary march day into something special and fun. e ven though she's now grown, we still honor the half birthday. and to make it even more special, her hubby also has a half birthday within days of hers. i guess we could have celebrated both "special" days yesterday with a whole cake - but it was so much more fun to have two halves. r ain in march is dreary and cold. but it washes away piles of january snow that have been dirty and ever-present for much too long. this taken from the driveway, through the windshield, while contemplating a dash between the raindrops and into warmth of the kitchen. s ee that spindly contraption of pastel pipe cleaners? i found it today on display at one of my favorite shops. it's an easter tree. an easter tree, for cryin' out loud!! the store even had little egg ornaments to hang from it, in addition to the easter baskets and bunnies and books. this christmas crossover is just too bizarre for me. decorate eggs at easter, yes - but not trees! is no tradition sacred? and what will they think of next?? b right light in the morning these march days and the air is smelling cool and earthy. deep in the woods, huge flocks of crows have been gathering at dawn, cawing and calling to each other, raucous enough to be heard even through still closed windows. the wood pile shrinks. the snow recedes. pine cones fall. the equinox looms. and finally this morning, i go outside without boots. s ix months now, my mother has been gone. all around me there are still her things, remembrances of the person she was and the life she lived. some items are finally being used up, like a stash of book matches, the packets of sugar, and this bottle of purple shampoo that matched her purple bathroom. for the longest while, i left them untouched, as they had been when she was alive, the only remaining pieces of her i could preserve in time. but as weeks and months pass, it's becoming a little easier to finally let her slip away. now i make myself use her things and i think of her when i do. even though the last of her lavender shampoo is now gone, my mom is still in my heart. o n my way to work this morning, i killed a small animal. i noticed it appear at the crest of a snow pile by the side of the road. i watched it scamper quickly down the bank. i saw it skitter out into the road, carrying a nut or a cone or something in his mouth. these little creatures are so fast. sometimes by swerving, you invariably hit them. so i stayed the course, slowing a bit and holding my breath. no small thudding sound and i thought he was safe. but a glance in the side view mirror showed the nut careening across the road, without its owner, who lay still, a small receding lump on the road behind me. it was just a squirrel. i don't know why i feel badly - but i do. f our old apples, hidden on a low shelf in the dark back corners of the refrigerator. too far gone for even applesauce, i'm afraid. using my best overhand, i'll fling them far out into the woods, a tasty snack for some surprised hungry deer who happens upon them, laying shriveled in the snow.
This book, written by Marcus T. Anthony (PhD), is a radical change from most self-help or spiritual-leaning books. Dr. Anthony has intensely studied both, coming up with a new way of integrating the two. Believing himself to be a "futurist," he provides specific processes intended to help the reader get in touch with their inner knowing. You know, that niggling little feeling in the back of your mind that says you really should be focusing here &nbsp;instead of there , or on this &nbsp;instead of that .&nbsp;He terms this process "integrated intelligence," and its outcome "wisdom and transformation." You can read some of Dr. Anthony's academic papers here , on his website. This book is a sequel to Integrated Intelligence , and is written in an easy to understand format. "This book is about a particular way of enhancing wisdom; using the innate ability of the mind to draw upon intelligence beyond the boundaries of self, and then applying that intelligence to make decisions, take action, and then reflect upon the whole process. This is the Wisdom Cycle." He doesn't give the kind of advice that says this process is easy. Quite the opposite. Which is why I liked this book. He helps the reader take responsibility, which I believe is the key to success when it comes to any kind of transformation. Giving ways of connecting and healing those broken parts of ourselves that often originate in childhood. Connecting and talking down the ego, which never goes away. It is part of who we are, an integral part of our psyche. It just has a habit of running the show, causing us untold havoc and problems. This book would appeal to those that are interested in psychology and spirituality. Also to those who feel they have a specific purpose, but have been unsuccessful in connecting with it. Based in psychology, but with new ways of understanding who we are, and how we can change the world through transformation of the mind, this was an interesting read. We picked two movies to watch this weekend. My pick was a flop, in our opinion. We didn't make it to the end, despite Ricky Gervais, a favorite of mine. I can't recommend The Invention of Lying . However, my husband's pick rocked - literally! We loved this movie! Without giving away the plot to those that might want to watch it - just let me say, if you love rock and roll, especially music from the sixties, you must watch this movie. Two big thumbs up! I'm in the process of cleaning up my blog. I have been following many people that either have not posted in several months, have not commented here, or have eliminated their blog altogether. So I stopped following several. However, if I stopped following you and you do stop by here occasionally, or may return to your blog eventually, please let me know! I will be more than happy to add you back. I would hate to lose a friend that is just taking a break. Remember, many of you are followed on my dashboard, not just on my sidebar. I still go there to check up on people I haven't heard from in a while. But if you haven't commented here, nor have you written on your blog in three months, I'm assuming you have moved along. In that case, I wish you all well, and if you return at some later date - please drop by. Blogger has just launched a brand new feature for templates! You can completely customize your blog without trying to download from other sites! Go here: http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/ Stay tuned for a new and improved Life In The Second Half! I am starting to see more and more buttons! I would really like to have a left side on my blog for buttons, but blogger doesn't seem to have one. Does anyone know anything about templates that are not from blogger? Do they work well? Can you add blogger gadgets? What should I watch out for? Help! I finally visited Hearst Castle on the southern California coast. Something that I've wanted to do for years. The structure was never finished, even after 30 years of construction. (Please click to enlarge!) There are several tours to choose from, and we took the basic tour which included two gigantic pools, one inside and one outside, both of olympic proportions. This tour also included one of three guest houses, William Randolph's favorite - the one he chose to spend time in toward the end of his life at age 88, despite a lavish master bedroom in the main structure. He had homes all over the world, but "The Ranch," as he referred to it, was special. It continues to be a working cattle ranch. Hearst's parents bought the property in 1865 and it includes 50 miles of coastline. The castle is now a museum, but the property and houses on the ranch remain with the Hearst Corporation. What we found interesting was the people who surrounded Mr. Hearst. He began building this incredible structure when he was 56 years old! After completing the first guest house, he began a 30-year affair with Marion Davies, a 21-year-old starlet, 37 years his junior. He never married her, and while she was his constant companion, his wife, and mother of his five sons, would sometimes act as hostess to important guests at the castle. Winston Churchill, Amanda Earhardt, Charles Lindbergh, David Niven, Howard Hughes, Myrna Loy, Bob Hope, Cary Grant, to name just a few. The story goes that while on his deathbed Davies became upset with the loud chatter and activity surrounding him. We can only guess that she felt he was not being afforded proper respect. At which point she was given a sedative by her niece and her niece's husband. When she awoke she was surprised to find that he had died during the night and his body, and all personal effects, had been removed. His funeral took place in San Francisco without her in attendance. It was only after the death of her niece did it become publicly known that she was actually the love child between herself and Hearst. One wonders if the "niece" ever knew who her real parents were, since it did not become public until after her death. Hearst was not known to have many children as guests at the ranch. The movie The Cat's Meow&nbsp; is based on Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst, and will be on my Netflix queue, since my current obsession is all things William Randolph. Of course there are other interesting stories, such as the supposed fatal shooting of Thomas Ince on Hearst's yacht. The story goes he caught Davies and Charlie Chaplin in bed, chasing him to the deck where he accidently shot Ince while trying to kill Chaplin. (Charlie was quite handsome!) Many more stories surround the life of William Randolph Hearst, but you'll have to wait until my next tour of the castle. We hope to make annual trips to the beautiful coast of California each spring. We had a great time soaking in the warmth. Los Angeles in March is great, but San Diego was even better. Off to the coast and a tour of Hearst Castle, (more about that tomorrow), and home to a light snow. Can't wait to fill you in on the gossip surrounding William Randolph, just in case you've forgotten that story... Looking forward to catching up with all of you! http://www.terragalleria.com/ See you in a few...
Well, that's how a friend of mine refers to The Captain's Arms, a local pub that's jumping once the weather turns cooler in Abu Dhabi. Like almost all liquor-serving establishments, it's located in a hotel (private clubs can serve, as well). These photos, taken with my camera phone after a few tasty pints, are of a 3 man band that starts in the Italian restaurant directly beside the Captain's Arms (Papagallo's) and eventually wanders over to pub's customers playing pretty much any song you request. Give them a 20 or 30 dirhams, and they'll hang around your table for a few extra songs.
Plumpest snow globs I've ever seen this far south. It was rather surreal. A bit like the 3" long rocket-shaped hail last winter. Extreme weather is thrilling. Scary. And it's going to get more extreme. Been through Missouri tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires and earthquakes, desert floods, Austin floods, blizzards, mudslides, El Nino, La Nina, droughts, and forest fires. There's a wild joy in nature busting loose, even when there is real danger. Somehow the primordial elements seem more in the order of things, rather than say, a car wreck.(Austin, TX, February 2010) Notice how green it is, even though it's snowing. Reminds me of a March--gee, 17 years ago--when I flew to Austin from NJ to attend Paul B's last party. We had been through 23 separate snow storms since New Year's Eve, with ice still on all but the major highways. As the plane dropped into the old Mueller airport, something felt off-kilter. Once we dropped below the clouds, it was emerald green as far as the eye could see. There wasn't a sprig of green in Jersey. A lush 18 inch thick carpet of grass stunned my snow-accustomed eyes. Bluebonnets hadn't yet bloomed, but it was obviously going to be a bumper year. Much like this spring will be.After years of relentless sunshine, heat and cold, withered plants and panting trees, Austin is a different animal this winter, metamorphosed by rain. Only in Texas skies can the color gray be described as vibrant. Light lends a different character to colors under the lowering
( beavertail cactus in bloom) " i hold no preference among flowers, so long as they are wild, free and spontaneous" ~desert solitaire~ edward abbey (ocotillo blossoms) we found very few wildflowers, beautiful, but few. it seems the daily reports we'd read were not all that accurate. (desert sunflower &amp; lupine) we weren't alone in that thinking either, there were droves of people that came for the predicted event. everyone asking "where are the flowers?" the epic wildflower bloom, ah well, mother nature surely decides these things, not us, doesn't she? (cholla (choy-ya) cactus) so we set about enjoying all the many other treasures the desert has to offer... in the desert the best way to see is to get quiet... get away from the crowds... get down on your knees for a closer look... find hearts and think of all your friends ♥ and take some hikes...we went from this to... this! we hiked six miles to an oasis, you would not guess by looking at these photos that this place is called hell hole canyon! can you see the small waterfall we cooled off in? (blooming agave) this photo shows the way we hiked to the palm covered oasis, it was over 80 degrees out! i seem to have picked up a few stragglers. when chuck pointed out a blooming barrel cactus i got so excited i hurried off the trail to see it. i forgot to look where i was stepping. :) we went on another hike to the breathtaking badlands... in one day we did three hikes, and covered sixteen miles. i think i counted just as many blisters! in anza - borrego desert it's okay to camp anywhere...we found a beautiful spot but it was so windy we couldn't put up our tent. instead we spread out our sleeping pads and bags in the truck bed and slept there! it was fun even if we didn't get much sleep. we listened to the wind and coyotes all night. and yes! there were stars, millions, i think we could see every single one. we decided to go exploring more of this thousand square mile wilderness, we were looking for a place where we read you could see native american rock art, and an ancient village... we drove and drove and and then hiked and hiked... there it is! incredible! i love this art form, pictographs, and especially love to imagine the native tribe that painted this. driving and hiking a little more we found the kumeyaay morteros... here it is! we are at a native american village site. the kumeyaay (ku-may-eye) people used this site on a seasonal basis. they gathered pinon nuts, mesquite beans and desert agave. nuts and seeds were pounded into meal in "morteros", the large depressions in the granite boulders. the informative sign said to sit quietly and imagine yourself working along side the kumeyaay women, pounding large rock pestles into the morteros, grinding seeds and talking over the news of the day. we did just that, grateful for the experience. (desert lily) on our third day in the desert i was feeling not quite as fresh as this flower . but roughing it is part of the fun. i do love to camp. while out on a drive we passed through the small town of borrego springs, chuck told me we needed gas. instead he drove up to one of the resorts and he told me we were getting a room for the night! he wanted to surprise me! for being a good sport he said. then we went out to a lovely dinner. sometimes camping is overrated. :) (sandverbena) we may not have gotten to see an epic flower show, this may not be the year for anza-borrego after all. but we did have a wonderful time, we gazed at stars, splashed in a desert waterfall, talked long talks while taking long walks. we saw a coyote (and heard them every night) a roadrunner, quail, cactus wrens and hummingbirds. we saw jackrabbits, honeybee's and blister beetles. and on our way out of the park, in the high desert i saw a nest with a large bird. i told chuck, i'd never seen a nest like this before. in a tree by the side of the road. so he turned around to get a better look.it was an eagle! we didn't want to stress the mama so we watched for just a moment and then left. i loved this trip. (buggy windscreen driveby photo of home) and apparently so did owen. back at home where he and hannah spent the last few days together, he went to a surf contest, met lots of new friends (dogs and people), dug lots of holes, went to a barbeque and went for a beach run. i don't think he missed us very much. but we sure missed him. tired sore happy lori ♥ figueroa mountain 2008 ~ it's the season for wildflowers here in california. this year is predicted to be epic, with all the elements necessary for a good year of blooms coming together just right. we've been checking all the hotlines and websites for updates to various places and we decided to head south to a desert on the Mexican border. here is some of what we'll (hopefully!) see... "The park features washes, wildflowers, palm groves, cacti and sweeping vistas. Visitors may also have the chance to see roadrunner, golden eagles, kit foxes, mule deer and bighorn sheep as well as iguanas, chuckwallas and the red diamond rattlesnake"... hopefully we'll get some beautiful images, i really wish i could capture the fragrance to share with you too. have a wonderful weekend everyone, see you next week (i'll be in a tent with no internet! but it does have a screen so we can look at the stars instead... :) ♥ lori (anacapa island, part of the channel islands, and a place that seems like heaven on earth to me) Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing. And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance. The Prophet Kahlil Gibran To everyone that knew and loved Renee, and to those that didn't, (i want to include everyone!), I'm sending out the biggest hug I can and all the love I have too. For that is the most important thing she showed me, the time for loving and telling those we do, is now. I love you. Dear Renee, you are free. You are loved! ♥ lori owen finally finished his puppy shots and we could start introducing him to the wonders of the world. chuck and i both knew the first place we'd take him would be the ocean. i think i was more excited than him, he was cautious. looking at it through little puppy eyes i saw big birds, big waves (well, when your only inches tall :) everythings potentially frightening. he ran and hid between my legs more than once. but i think he had fun. oh owen. i recently bought some wool made from local alpacas, you can read about it here if you like. i knit it into these two hats. the pattern can be found at the purl bee here . this wool was incredibly lovely to work with, it's beyond soft. there was a tiny bit left so i made this teddy bear for the mother bear project. if you'd like to know more about this non-profit group go here , these are simple to make, using only the knit stitch. he's so soft and warm! here is the beginning of my international garden! two lovely blogging friends, janet from south africa and natalie from australia, sent me seeds. they germinated and this week i see little sprouts coming up through the potting soil! see these australian daisies? so exciting. i have an image of an international garden, seeds representing friends from around the world! maybe we can figure out some kind of seed exchange? we could all have global gardens! i don't have a photo of the most important thing that happened this week, the last of my children got her drivers licence. there were a few reasons why she didn't get it until age 19. one of them is she likes riding her bike. even though a car is handy for some things, all of us (the kids, chuck and i) walk, ride bikes and take public transportation as well as drive. she also received an acceptance letter from the college she applied to. here we go again. :) it was a good week ♥ i hope you have a wonderful week ahead (we've got a small trip planned!), and i'm really sorry for being a bad blogging friend, i'll be by to visit you all soon! ♥ lori thank you for all the birthday wishes for my son, they were much appreciated! i had to take photos of the treasures i found last weekend and of course share them here. see the three little gnomes? they are like little rattles, someone long ago filled them with rocks or seeds to weigh them down. i think they'll add so much charm to my garden! this is a one of a kind plate by susan branch! it is a series of three. i love the soft colors and the little mouse. can you see what she's written? it says: now i see why people like to paint these adorable creatures...i had to stop myself from putting little clothes on them ♥ and these books by sharon lovejoy. i can't say enough about them, if you love nature, gardening and children, you will love these! there is so much to choose from, projects and ideas, i don't know where to begin. thank you sharon for the inspiration, you truly do spread love and joy! my finds: the books, the plate, a stack of old martha stewart gardening magazines, the gnomes, an old tablecloth and an old victorian finial with old peeling paint, and the color, pink! and more pink ... my shawlette, all blocked and done. i'm not sure this is the best way to photograph it. stretching it out on nails is probably not a good idea, but lacking a model, it'll have to do. i like to wear it as a scarf, wrapped around my neck, the wool is so soft and smells so good, it's my favorite. thank you sally anne, again, i loved this yarn. i even have enough i think to make a tiny pair of baby booties! here is another scarf i made this week. it's a scrumptiously soft one piece scarf that you can wear long like this or... like this, wrapped twice around your neck for a cowl. the colors don't really show, it's more of a pinky mauve. i used plymouth yarns baby alpaca grande yarn. it took two skeins on a size ten needle. the pattern was based on a mobius cowl scarf but i couldn't get the hang of the cast on for that so it's simply a continuous scarf instead. i cast on 150 stitch's, placed a marker, then purled for 4 rounds knit for 4, continuing like that until it was about 8 inches wide. that's it! so cozy and warm. photos are taken with the softest early morning light, but it was brief since another storm is on the way, let's go outside next, owen is waiting! bulbs are coming up! these were here when we moved in, what a fantastic discovery every year, these gorgeous yellow blooms! owen likes them too. here he looks all mild mannered, smelling the blossoms. right after this photo he shook them all apart. oh owen. fallen camellias make a pretty still life arranged on a mossy stepping stone... with a little help from me! and our oranges are almost ready. i wish you could smell this tree. the last thing i want to remember of this week, is the thing i'd also like to forget! i went to see my dentist last monday. it involved all the shots, drills and other torture devices they treat you with. i am still numb from one of the shots, apparently there was a little muscle or nerve damage, i hope it goes away soon! my dentist mentioned that it might help me to relax if i closed my eyes and imagined a place i love. somewhere i'd like to be. i did and here is what came into my thoughts...the seventeen giraffe i saw gracefully striding across a grassy plain in zimbabwe. i love giraffes and i love africa. this image played through my head making the time i spent in that chair not so bad after all. where would your favorite place be? have a lovely weekend everyone ! ♥ lori twenty four years ago a child was born, baby number three he'd be for me. best brother, uncle, friend and son, he makes my life, this one. happy happy birthday erik love forever, mom ♥ p.s. so hard to choose photos to make this collage, i love all the millions of photos i have of my keikis. umm. make that zillions. this post is dedicated to our friend renee, who loved to travel (vicariously) with me on my adventures. i loved her company and she'll be dearly missed. she'll be leaving this world soon as this life as she knows it is coming to an end. bless her beautiful heart. safe journey my angel kindred friend. i invited my eldest daughter to come with me on saturday, up to the small town of arroyo grande. there was someone i was hoping to meet at a special antique sale &amp; book signing. here we are, at branchs farm, i am sure the weather couldn't have been more beautiful, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, people were smiling... we looked around, me enjoying more the scenery than anything else. after our recent rains the hills and fields were green and lush, spring feels like it's arrived... this pile of books represents heaven to me. this is why i came almost two hours (although i would have come four, to meet this kindred spirit, author and illustrator... Sharon Lovejoy! what a thrill for me to meet her and her husband, that's Jeff standing behind her. I've been collecting and reading Sharon's books for 19 years now. that's when her first book, Sunflower Houses:Inspiration from the Garden first came out. She's recently released her seventh book, Toad Cottages &amp; Shooting Stars. another gem i treasure. there is no one that's inspired me more in gardening and watercolors, except my own granma rose. and i am so happy to say that she was even more charming in person and i didn't think that was possible if you know her books. this was one of those days that i'll never ever forget. thank you sharon, i can't wait to meet again someday! until then i know we'll stay in touch via blogging, if you'd like to visit her go here . (see my new scarf?, finished, well, it still needs blocking!) susan branch was there too, and many of her books and patterns, stencils and calendars. i met her also and although she was lovely as well, it was brief, there was a long line! we'll leave the farm now and go explore the town of arroyo grande... we stopped for fields of blooms... and antique stores... we walked (tentatively) over a swinging bridge, with a running creek below... we went to farmer's market. at one booth my daughter kimberly and i stopped to admire tiny watercolor paintings, all of different scenes of the central coast. a couple was there also asking the artist about the various locations. he said your not from around here are you? they answered no, we're from winnepeg. winnepeg is renee's home. my daughter and i had just had lunch and i told her about the latest news with renee and her own daughter angelique. we both had tears as i shared what i knew. when not an hour later we heard this couple say winnepeg, kimberly and i both stopped. and hugged. and i am sure i saw all the trees and flowers sway suddenly in the wind as if they knew and she knew she were here with us. and i had tears again. after we crossed the bridge we found yet another antique store, i could keep this up all day, but i wanted kimberly to enjoy it too, she said she was, so on we went... "be careful with the words you use, they create the world around you" a native american saying i love. isn't this a sweet and simple sign?.... more beauty everywhere, in thoughtful displays... and soft fabrics nestled in baskets... new blossoms appearing on a painted sky... and funny chickens and roosters that mind your business on the streets of this town... thank you for coming with kimberly and i, now it's time we started making our way home, safe journeys to all of us... ♥ happy sad lori (i can't seem to leave off the back to the beloved ocean going home photo, however blurred and an antenna filled it is.) last night was girl's night out! friends of mine that own a gorgeous shop, had an after hours, ladies only night. the invitation said : it is a gathering of amazing women, friends &amp; clients, and a hand-picked group of talented service professionals who will be offering up a taste of their services to each of our guests (you!). Each guest will have the opportunity to spend 15 minutes at 2 or more service “stations”, which include a fabulous facialist, two masseuses (one Thai and one Swedish), a tarot card reader, an astrologer and more. Iris de Santo, one of our favorite jewelers, will be showing her gorgeous and well-priced jewelry as well. So, please join us for a special evening - kind of a mini-spa night with a splash of mystery &amp; fun, lots of laughs &amp; good food too! i chose the tha
 massage and the tarot card reading. what wasn't mentioned was all the flowing prosecco champagne, hence, all the slightly (slight understatement too) blurred photos! heehee, if i had remembered to take photos at the start you would have seen all kinds of happy laughing faces, massage tables and service stations, lovely fruit and cheese plates, cupcakes! but i was having too much fun to think of my camera. thank you christie and diana! what fun! i hope a girl's night, in what ever form, comes soon for you too, ♥ lori
Among Arab leaders there is growing frustration that they are the forgotten people, accused of being Janjaweed when many families played no part in the conflict, or lost everything when they could ignore it no longer. They accuse aid workers, celebrities and campaigners with the Save Darfur Campaign of concentrating efforts on the African tribes, neglecting the suffering of Arab communities. Adam Mohammed Hamid, of the Nomad Development Council of Sudan in Khartoum, said: “People think they know who the Arabs are, but they don’t. They come to Sudan and speak to the African tribes, but no one speaks to the Arabs. Many are not fighting. Some are in the rebels. It is not what people think.” Without the Janjaweed on board there will be no lasting solution, writes ROB CRILLY, in Otash Camp, South Darfur Vilified Arabs of Darfur must be included in peace process From The Irish Times Tuesday, March 16, 2010 By Rob Crilly THERE IS a well-trodden VIP path around Darfur’s aid camps. Celebrities, politicians and United Nations officials fly in from Khartoum, take the tour and are back on their jets before teatime. The whistlestop visits don’t go anywhere near the ramshackle corner of Otash Camp that Sheikh Hassan Mohammed Mahmoud calls home. If they did, then Sudan’s rumbling, complex conflict might be a little nearer resolution. Sheikh Hassan’s story would turn their conception of Darfur’s miserable conflict upside down. He is from one of the Arab tribes that make up the backbone of the dreaded Janjaweed: a people routinely vilified as genocidal monsters. But ask him who was responsible for destroying his village, shooting his sons and forcing his people in to the camp, and he gives a one-word answer: “Harakat”, Arabic for “movement” or “rebels”. They came as his village, Marla, was waking up. Children were fetching water and the women were tending their cooking fires as the sound of shouting and shooting came closer. Sheikh Hassan gathered up as many of his 20 children as he could find, and ran for the woods. He didn’t get far before a searing pain ripped through his leg. He had been shot. The rest of the journey to safety was made on a cart as he slipped in and out of consciousness. The group stayed in the woods for days as the 60-year-old man gradually regained his strength. When they returned to the village, Sheikh Hassan found the corpses of two of his sons. A third would die in hospital. Some 25 cows, 35 goats and a horse – Sheikh Hassan’s entire wealth – had been stolen. “We found the village was burned,” he said in Arabic. “There was nothing left. War had come, so we came here.” He and his people are the forgotten victims of the Darfur conflict. When rebels took up arms against the government in 2003, Khartoum responded by mobilising the Janjaweed – fearsome Arab militias with a traditional role as defenders of their tribes. They were sent on a scorched earth campaign, tasked with attacking civilians in an attempt to starve the rebels of support. Today, the conflict is often understood as one of Arabs against so-called African tribes. Sheikh Hassan’s Beni Halba people were among the Janjaweed. But he, his family and his village did their best to ignore the war until it eventually swept through their little village that morning. Today, they are eking out a miserable life in one of the sprawling aid camps, just like the tribes from the other side – the Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit – who support the rebels. Among Arab leaders there is growing frustration that they are the forgotten people, accused of being Janjaweed when many families played no part in the conflict, or lost everything when they could ignore it no longer. They accuse aid workers, celebrities and campaigners with the Save Darfur Campaign of concentrating efforts on the African tribes, neglecting the suffering of Arab communities. Adam Mohammed Hamid, of the Nomad Development Council of Sudan in Khartoum, said: “People think they know who the Arabs are, but they don’t. They come to Sudan and speak to the African tribes, but no one speaks to the Arabs. Many are not fighting. Some are in the rebels. It is not what people think.” Researchers from Tufts University support his view. In a paper published last year, they warned that a highly politicised public campaign for Darfur had made it difficult to see the nomadic, Arab tribes as anything other than the perpetrators of the violence. Instead, the team argued that the nomads had lost their livelihoods as a result of the war and in some cases had turned to violence as a “maladaptation” to seeing their traditional role disappear. Those factors are often overlooked by media portrayals that depict Arabs as driven by race hate. “The nomads are voiceless. Their illiteracy and lack of contact with the international community has completely disempowered them in terms of raising awareness about their situation,” said the team led by Helen Young. The issue is relevant once again as peace talks continue in the Qatari capital of Doha. Leaders from the Justice and Equality Movement and government officials gave themselves until yesterday, March 15th, to sign a deal that would bring rebel leaders to Khartoum. But once again – like the failed 2006 talks in Abuja – the Darfuri Arab tribes would not be represented. Julie Flint, co-author of Darfur: A New History of a Long War, said they have to be part of the peace process. “Darfur’s Arabs are part of the problem, as the whole history of the war has shown, but they are also part of the solution, as is apparent in the many areas where they have made local reconciliation agreements and are living in peace with their neighbours again,” she said. “What is succeeding at the local level must be replicated at the regional level. Darfur’s Arabs can be a force for peace, just as they have been a force for war. Without them there will be no lasting solution.” Any peace deal signed in Doha will be good news for Darfur. But it is only the first step to solving the region’s problems for good. Real solutions will have to involve forgotten people like Sheikh Hassan.

Photo: Abdulwahid al-Nur (Photo credit: ST ) Abdulwahid al-Nur Explains Why He Won't Join Darfur Peace Talks Report from SRS (Sudan Radio Service), Tuesday, 16 March 2010: 16 March 2010 - (Nairobi/Paris) - The leader of the Darfur anti-government group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdulwahid al-Nur faction, says he is reluctant to join the Darfur peace talks because the Government of National Unity does not understand the true meaning of peace. In an interview with SRS from Paris on Monday, Abdulwahid al-Nur said peace is not about the distribution of political influence. [Abdulwahid al-Nur]: “I would like to confirm that we completely differ with the Khartoum government on the peace process in Darfur. The Sudanese government believes that peace means giving positions to the anti-government group’s leaders, or it believes that peace means correcting the consequences of the wrong actions they were responsible for in Sudan. But for us peace means ensuring security on the ground first, then secondly tackling the root causes of the conflict. We have a road map to achieve peace in Darfur. Peace starts by conflict suspension or security. The government should first stop the genocide against our people, disarm their militia the Janjaweed and stop the rape of our women and chase out the new settlers from Mali and Niger. The meaning of peace to us is when people feel that they are secure. But to GONU, peace is giving power to people in Khartoum and in the region and that is all.” Over the weekend, the US Special Envoy to Sudan, Scott Gration, told the press in Doha that al-Nur has wasted a "historic" opportunity to join the peace talks. In response, al-Nur described Gration as a colonizer who ignores the conflict in Darfur. [Abdulwahid al-Nur]: “To me, Gration reminds me of that terrible era when people used to think that Africans didn’t know how to think and they colonized them. Particularly the European colonization and the colonization of the white man. That is why he comes to terrorize people, divide them and gives them the feeling that he is a god and he can destroy them if they don’t abide by his commands. Neither Gration nor anyone else in the world can make us miss the opportunity, because we own the rights, the issues, the land and a country. This is our country and it is our right to straighten it out. We didn’t tell Gration to come and solve our problems for us, we will solve it by ourselves.” Al-Nur accused the GONU of signing agreements without implementing them. [Abdulwahid al-Nur]: “Have we ever refused to sign a peace agreement with the government? Earlier we went to sign a peace agreement in Abuja, we and Minni and JEM. After that, how many movements were created by the government? Even if all the movements, including ours, sign a peace agreement, and still there is no security in Darfur, there will be a new rebellion - do you think that we are the only men in the region? So peace is not a matter of signing papers. The NCP is very ready to sign any number of papers but if you go back and look at all peace agreements that the NCP has signed, how many have been implemented?” Abdulwahid al-Nur, the leader of the Darfur anti-government group, the SLM -Abdulwahid al-Nur faction, was speaking to SRS from Paris on Monday.

Extract from a recent email (copy here below) by Save Darfur Coalition: In each camp, we asked IDPs what message we could bring back to activists in America. Consistently, we were thanked for the work of our movement to bring media attention and put pressure on world leaders to act to resolve the crisis and asked to keep fighting for justice. On more than one occasion, we were asked to "please press the movements for peace" — a direct call for rebel leaders to stop fighting and negotiate for peace. One camp leader summed up the message clearly: "keep on working to raise your voice for all IDPs." I, for one, am motivated now more than ever to keep raising my voice on behalf of the millions in Darfur who want justice, peace, and security. Copy of email from Save Darfur Coalition Date: 02 March 2010 Subject: "I lost my family, I lost my country, I may lose my life." Dear friend, Just hours have slipped past since I returned home from Sudan — and the thoughts, fears, frustrations, and hopes of Darfuris and other Sudanese swirl together in my mind. Traveling to Khartoum, Darfur, and Juba allowed me and my colleagues Jerry Fowler and Sean Brooks to see Sudan for ourselves, to observe what it is like in internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps, and collect the stories of real people and what they are experiencing day to day to improve our advocacy on behalf of the people of Sudan. Common themes of security, aid, and political freedom emerged from our travels in Darfur. We visited 6 different IDP camps, meeting with camp leaders and IDPs. First and foremost, IDPs named security as their number one concern. Many complained of being subject to violence when leaving camps — not just women risking rape but both men and women being attacked when they go to the market or work in the cities. We often heard descriptions of the most recent attacks and that this violence was on the rise, not decline. Despite Sudanese government claims that IDPs were returning to their villages in large numbers, we found little evidence of this. While there may be some returns and some seasonal migration to farm, IDPs said the main reason they cannot return home is because of a lack of security, and in some cases because other people were occupying the land they once lived on. One leader said, "When we can travel for two days without being attacked, we will go with no one telling us." The source of the ongoing threat of violence is unclear. IDPs typically complained about Janjaweed while the government blamed rebel factions and general banditry. We experienced a heavy armed presence in Darfur — from checkpoints and guards at buildings to "technicals," which are pickup trucks with a heavy machine gun and a few uniformed men on back, deployed regularly in strategic locations along main routes. As we approached one IDP camp, we saw a technical speed off through the middle of the camp at a high rate of speed. Despite this heavy presence, reports of violent attacks were prolific, including carjackings of multiple UN staff we met with. In order not to endanger ongoing operations in light of the March 4th, 2009 expulsions we did not meet with any humanitarian organizations in Darfur. It is unfortunate we could not benefit from their collective experience, but in our role as advocates we were able to personally witness a number of continuing humanitarian challenges which need to be addressed. While distribution of food aid has been picked up by the World Food Programme and some new partners, provision of adequate water supplies appeared to be more problematic, exacerbated by poor rains last year. At one camp, water was shut down at noon, and hand pumps were broken. In multiple camps we visited, people lined up for water, with rows and rows of empty jugs waiting to be filled. We saw unsanitary conditions around some pumps where spilled water runs 
ff and mixes with animal waste — and children run around in bare feet. Health services also seem to have suffered following the expulsions last year. Medical staff said they typically treat cases of chest and eye infections, malaria and diarrhea. A shortage of medicine, including cough syrup and antibiotics, and lack of access to laboratories were cited as problems. Also, many of the programs previously in place to prevent gender-based violence and treat rape survivors have not been replaced. We asked IDPs what they thought about the upcoming elections. The overwhelming majority of IDPs said they did not register and therefore will be disenfranchised in the election. Some said they didn't bother because "we don't have real representatives to vote for," while others feel that free political conditions do not exist. The ongoing state of emergency and level of violence leave doubts about a safe environment for candidates and voters in Darfur. When asked whether he feared for his life, one tribal leader told us, "I lost my family, I lost my country, I may lose my life." But he was resolved to carry on advocating for a just and lasting peace. One bright spot is the desire for peace. A real movement for peace exists across the camps we visited. IDPs we talked to generally want to participate in the peace process but feel they are not being included. One camp leader told us, "IDPs have ideas to give." In each camp, we asked IDPs what message we could bring back to activists in America. Consistently, we were thanked for the work of our movement to bring media attention and put pressure on world leaders to act to resolve the crisis and asked to keep fighting for justice. On more than one occasion, we were asked to "please press the movements for peace" — a direct call for rebel leaders to stop fighting and negotiate for peace. One camp leader summed up the message clearly: "keep on working to raise your voice for all IDPs." I, for one, am motivated now more than ever to keep raising my voice on behalf of the millions in Darfur who want justice, peace, and security. Jerry Fowler and I will be hosting a special live webcast on Thursday at 2:00 PM to share more about our trip to Darfur and Sudan. Please take a second to register for the webcast or submit a question you would like us to answer on Thursday. I hope you will continue to stand with me in support of the people of Sudan. Sincerely, Mark Lotwis Save Darfur Coalition Related reports March 16, 2010 commentary by Julie Flint, The Daily Star Back to bloody square-one in Darfur - excerpt: In 2002, when Darfur was as familiar to most people as Outer Mongolia, Sudanese regular forces and aircraft as well as pro-government militias attacked Jebel Marra, the mountainous center of Darfur where rebels were organizing an insurgency. I learned about it when Abdul Wahid Mohammad al-Nur, the chairman of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), called me by satellite telephone to invite me to witness “the genocide being committed against my people.” ... The Abdul Wahid-led SLA, which refuses to join the peace talks in Doha, replayed the start of the insurgency in January by attacking the town of Golo, the insurgents’ first target seven years ago. ... The people of Jebel Marra are between a rock and a hard place – the rock of Abdul Wahid’s insistence that security be restored before he negotiates; and the hard place of Khartoum’s response. Khartoum made clear that it intended to resolve the Darfur situation by the elections in April. From the comfort of Paris, Abdul Wahid ignored those signals. ... March 15, 2010 commentary by C.R., Save Darfur Coalition's Blog for Darfur : Untouchable Crisis? A Call to Action - excerpt: As Save Darfur – a unique community of activists and rights organizations – we have been called to action. The international community and the Save Darfur movement worked hard to see the deployment of UNAMID. Now – amid the worst fighting in the 27 months since its deployment and as crucial national elections approach – this voice is as essential as it ever was. Likewise, activists and NGOs from around the world fought tirelessly to ensure UNAMID was provided with essential equipment like tactical helicopters capable of rapid intervention. Now that these gunships have arrived, it is our responsibility to ensure they are used to enhance UNAMID’s peacekeeping presence and enforce its mandate to protect civilians. The global community needs to express its concern, mobilize support for Darfuri civilians caught in these clashes, and remind international policymakers why they should care about what’s going on in Jebel Marra. It is our mandate both to act and to demand action – and the time to do so is now.

Darfur rebels say attack govt town after bombings From Reuters by Opheera McDoom, Wed, 13 January 2010 12:04pm GMT: (KHARTOUM) - Darfur rebels said they attacked a government-held town in the Jabel Marra area of western Sudan on Wednesday in retaliation for army bombardment of their areas, a move likely to hinder peace talks set to open this month. Tensions were already high in oil-producing Sudan which is gearing up for presidential, parliamentary and state governor elections in April. The Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) loyal to founder Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur said they attacked Golo in Jabel Marra in retaliation for government bombings of rebel-controlled areas there and in the Jabel Moun area on the border with Chad. "The government started this with bombing in Jabel Moun and in Jabel Marra," said SLA commander Ibrahim el-Helwu. "We attacked Golo this morning -- we have casualties and the government has many casualties," he added. The joint U.N.-African union peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) does not have troops in the area but said aid workers caught in the crossfire had sought refuge in their compound. "For the time being they (aid workers) are safe," said Balla Keita, UNAMID commander for West Darfur. A government intelligence source said fighting was still going on, but Sudan's army was not immediately available to comment. Darfur peace talks, which have faltered for the past three years, are due to reopen this month in Qatar, but the fighting is likely to fuel mistrust between the rebels and Khartoum. In 2003 mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms against the government, accusing it of neglecting the region. Khartoum mobilised mainly Arab militias to crush the uprising. The United Nations estimates 300,000 people have died as a result of the conflict and that 2 million have been driven from their homes according to the United Nations. Sudan puts the death toll at 10,000. Last year the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hasan al-Bashir for war crimes in Darfur. Keita said the government had bombed Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) positions in the Jabel Moun area. "They have confirmed that they bombed JEM positions because they say JEM is running operations in Jabel Moun," he said. A JEM commander in the Jabel Moun area said the attacks had been going on for several days. "For the past week there has been heavy bombing of our people," al-Tijani Kharshome told Reuters by telephone. "There are hundreds of families who have fled their homes and are hungry and thirsty," said Kharshome, who is from a large Arab tribe in Darfur. - - - Sudan's Army, Rebels Clash in Darfur From Voice of America News, Wed, 13 January 2010: Rebels in Sudan's Darfur region say they clashed with government forces Wednesday, days before a scheduled new round of peace talks. The Sudan Liberation Army faction of Abdel Wahid Nur said its troops attacked the government-held Golo district in the Jebel Marra mountains. A spokesman said there were casualties on both sides. He did not give specific figures. The joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping mission confirmed there was fighting in the area. The rebels say earlier this week, Sudanese warplanes bombarded rebel-controlled areas in Jebel Marra and in Jebel Moun, near the border with Chad. Peace talks between Khartoum and Darfur rebel groups are due to resume later this month in Qatar. The United Nations says the fighting in Darfur has killed up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million since 2003. The government says 10,000 people have died in the conflict. Some information for this report was provided by AP, AFP and Reuters. - - - Darfur rebels attack Sudanese army in Jebel Marra From Sudan Tribune, Thur, 14 January 2010: January 13, 2009 (KHARTOUM) — A Darfur rebel group today attacked a Sudanese army-held town in Jebel Marra in North Darfur after repeated government bombing of their position, a rebel spokesman said. [Photo] Sudan Liberation Army rebels speed through the desert east of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state November 8, 2004. (file/Reuters) Ibrahim El Hilu, a spokesperson from the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) led by Abdel Wahid Al Nur told Sudan Tribune they attacked on Wednesday morning the position of the Sudanese army in Gulu, the capital of the mountainous area. The rebel official said these attacks come after daily bombardment by the Sudanese army in the region adding they decided to protect the civilians by their proper means as the international community failed to press Khartoum to stop "indiscriminate violence". El-Hilu said they arrested more than forty government troops, among them a colonel and a lieutenant whose names and military details he provided to Sudan Tribune. He also said they captured 17 military vehicles with weapons and ammunitions. Since this summer, rebels loyal to the SLM founder reported regular bombing against their positions in different areas of the Jebel. The army and pro-government militia attacked also their position in Korma and Ain Siro. Abdel Wahid Al-Nur confirmed the attack saying the SLM leadership decided to carry out this attack to protect the civilians in the mountainous areas reminding that his troops observe the 2004 ceasefire agreement but have the right to defend the area. He stressed that the decision had been taken in consultation with the SLA Commander in Chief Abdel Gadir Gadora and Mohamed Abdel Salam Tarada. Al-Nur stressed that they are peace seekers but asked Khartoum to stop violence on Darfur civilians. "We are peace seekers and if the government stops the violence against Darfur civilians and provides the necessary environment for their security, we can take part in the peace process without precondition." The rebel leader further urged the Red Cross to contact them to visit the prisoners of the Sudanese army and inspect their conditions. UNAMID official spokesperson Noureddine Mezni confirmed to Sudan Tribune the attack, adding they had no presence in the area but received reports about the assault from the NGOs working there. Mezni said they have no access to areas controlled by the SLA-AW. "Unfortunately we cannot provide humanitarian aid or deal with the injuries among the civilian population there." He urged the rebel group to reconsider its position and allow the peacekeeping mission to visit their areas in order to accomplish its duties as provided in the UN mandate. Meanwhile, the Darfur peace mediator is preparing to hold direct talks between the government and the rebel groups to end the seven year conflict on January 24 in Doha. The main rebel groups blame Khartoum for its lack of credibility and yet say they are ready to negotiate under some conditions. In a new development, last week the joint mediator said he is expecting Al-Nur to join the peace process. Also the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said today government warplanes bombed the area of Jebel Moon in West Darfur State where the rebel group holds some positions. JEM Spokesman Ahmed Hussein Adam said that hundreds of civilians moved to eastern Chad to flee the daily bombardment. UN experts have estimated that the fighting in Darfur resulted in the deaths of up to 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million since 2003. However the Sudanese government says only 10,000 people have died in the conflict. (ST) - - - Chad bombs rebels near Sudan border: UFR From AFP Saturday, 16 January 2010: KHARTOUM — Chadian air force jets bombarded rebel positions in a region bordering Sudan and the Central African Republic, a rebel source said on Saturday. The warplanes carried out the air strikes on Friday near the village of Tissi, said the senior official with the Union of Forces for Resistance (UFR) rebel group who requested anonymity. The rebels responded by shooting at and hitting one of the aircraft, the official said, adding that: "We expect an intensification of the Chadian army's operations." Most of the UFR rebels are based in Sudan's Darfur region, with a force also in Chad. Chad and Sudan agreed on Friday for the first time to set up a joint force on their troubled border which will be deployed on February 20. Chad has accused Sudan of supporting rebels seeking to oust the government, while Khartoum has charged Ndjamena with backing ethnic minority rebels in the conflict-torn western Sudanese region of Darfur. Improved ties between the two countries could help bring peace to Darfur, where about 300,000 people have died since ethnic rebels revolted in 2003. - - - Darfur rebels say Sudan army attacks market area From Reuters, Saturday, 16 January 2010 12:32pm EST (KHARTOUM) - Darfur rebels said Sudan's army had attacked their troops in a populated area of the western state of North Darfur on Saturday, escalating fighting ahead of peace talks due to open this month. Tensions were already high in oil-producing Sudan which is gearing up for presidential, parliamentary and state governor elections in April. Saturday's attack follows an assault by the rebel Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) on the government garrison town Golo in Jabel Marra last Wednesday after days of government bombardment of rebel positions in Sudan's remote west. "The government attacked our areas in the market area of Furug," SLA commander Ibrahim el-Helwu told Reuters. "This is a heavily populated area," he added. The army spokesman's office was not immediately available to comment and the U.N.-African Union peacekeepers (UNAMID) said they we
To my new blog address: Who Said Mermaids Can't Tango? The time has come for me return! Seaweed and Gardenias has officially turned off its lights. I've been at The Ranch with my bros (all three of 'em) and my Ciera Beara and My Lovely Mother since Friday evening, which is why I was able to post yesterday, and again now. I read all the comments and I feel humble and also ashamed. I pretty much lied a lot (to myself, to you) in my farewell post. The truth is that I feel embarrassed to say that hell no, I wouldn't stop blogging totally if I had the money to run right out and replace my laptop. This (bloglandia) is where my only friendships exist outside of my mom, my family. It's taken me all my lifetime to feel a part of something I always wanted: A GROUP OF DIVERSE, CREATIVE, INSPIRING WOMEN ... and not only that, but a group of women who enjoy ME as much as I enjoy them. Then my laptop takes a shite and I get drop-kicked out of my soul community. I can barely stand it. It's like all the times my Dad moved us, just when I'd finally settled into some friendships and a sense of belonging. I'm heartbroken. I'm in dire financial straits. I'm completely shamed by that and didn't want to say it out loud because I'm not looking for sympathy or rescue but had hoped to be in different circumstances by this time in my life. And I just emailed Holly that the biggest blow of all, out of this, is that I've been quietly maneuvering myself toward actualizing my own dream, at the encouragement of so so many of you, to 'write a novel'. Only it was going to be a new blog called The Weight of Me, to be a home to my creative writing: poetry, prose, thoughtflows, journal entries, in my very own unique TRUE style ... so I can't honestly accept the 'hero' kudos because they aren't deserved, although I intended to back off Seaweed and Gardenias and edge over to The Weight of Me much much more ... but I do accept the love and wanted to return it by telling the true story -- how I feel about this, how much it feels like an amputation, how damn angry I am, how afraid I am of becoming, for the umpteenth time in my life, The Outsider. Again. Of being forgotten because I've had to forcibly move on. Thank you to all of you for what you've said, in comments and privately. I will definitely be in touch via email. I awoke to rain rain rain ... sweet good morning. This inspired me to take my Daddy-O Cam to work with me and take puddle pictures. At home, after work, my youngest male child enlisted MOM to help him make tacos -- meaning he wanted to go buy the fixins and have ME do it, but I wasn't in enabler mode ... I stood close and gave instructions in my best Julia Child voice, and also took photos of him chopping onion, greasing the shell pan, stirring in the taco sauce ... after, he and I sat to do some on-line work related to his financial aid (first class is the 19th) ... and then we received .... WAIT FOR IT ... THE FATAL BLUE SCREEN ERROR!!! and the laptop happily shut itself down, with an 'in your face' whistle. My male child and I looked at each other, eyebrows knit together, both of us clearly thinking our individual versions of WTF? So I booted it back up AND had a message waiting for me: SYSTEM HAS EXPERIENCED A FATAL DISC ERROR. And the damn thing blue-screened and shut down again. I have not paid the IT guy fully, yet, for the last go-round to repair the sucker. Best Buy can replace the hard drive but you know? I've already paid MORE to try to fix the thang than I originally paid to purchase it. Given our current home repair and Two Sons In College situation, and the fact that I got no raise for going into my 3rd year ... I'm not feeling a laptop replacement as a priority. At all. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ What that means, though, is that my blog anniversary was also my blog farewell. I have, in the past, managed the occasional covert blog post from work, but relying on posting from the office is a truly BAD idea, completely unrealistic. Anyway, I can't download the driver for my Daddy-O Cam or any other software without alerting my boss, who is adamantly opposed to anything extraneous (or personal) by way of programs on the company server. Truth is, for the last year I've been straddling the fence on whether to continue blogging or not. I love it, yet I resent it (time suckage). I've become more and more BORED with myself -- i.e. posting journal backgrounds ... and I've wanted more time to read, to hang with my boys and watch movies, to get OUT of the studio more, to start walking and weight training with my Double BB, to approach a personal creative writing project I've been piecing together in a goal book/dedicated journal for over a decade. I've been talking to the Universe for 3 months about all this, unable to reach a decision. When in England, I was LOVING not having any laptop, no email, no blog posting at all, no reason whatsoever to be on 'Laptop Lockdown' ... just to realize I had been referring to it that way ... pretty indicative. So ... I'm taking this as the Universe's answer to my querying and pleading and ranting and agonizing and vacillating. A dead laptop and financial lockdown are a pretty non-negotiable lockdown of their own. Those of you lovely people out there who want to stay in touch ... even though I'm on Facebook, I hate that venue so don't visit much at all. Emailing me is still the most direct way to contact me. Feel free to do so! antoniafufu@yahoo.com Lights out. True story. Love to all. I'm fiddling with my blog -- colors, fonts, borders, 'About Me', banner, EVERYTHANG! -- because tomorrow is my two year blogging anniversary and I wanted to do something perky in honor of that. I want to open it up in the morning and be 'blinked' (as my bro, the Bobfather, says when something sooprises him -- 'hey that blinked me!') I like this EXCEPT that I can't get the cream background color of the posts to change to a soft lilac. Oh well, at least I got my chocolate pawlet girl in the banner ... YES!!!! I took several shots of her and she chose the one above. She did, true story -- she chewed on the corner; that's how I knew. Plus she said she looked cute all mellowed out like that. (Personally, I think it looks like she's been hitting my Coors Light, but hey, it was her call!) You probably recognize Ian's marigold (my heart), although my ink cartridge is down to 'sputter and maybe', so it's not that gorgeous shimmering GOLD in this print out. [One of Zoe's shots that didn't make the cut, but which I happen to really like. Neener, Pawlets!] All the bits in the banner (not including photos) came from my darling Beth! She gives GOOOOOOD care packages, that woman! She even somehow sent me the red flocked vintage wallpaper in the banner -- Patty at The Tuscan Rose sent me a supply of that a LONG time ago, and I used it up a LONG time ago, too! Happy two years to my blog, if I do say so myself! Think Javier will join me for ice cream and ... and whipped cream? I'm sending out an S.O.S.! [All photos mine, from Chatsworth] Playing catch-up at work so sharing images today and nothing else. Ms. Holly, you are welcome to the Buddha image(s) if you like them. Don't ask, cuz I have NO idea! This post's title was borrowed from River Garden Studio , the incredible Roxanne's most recent post. I just recognized it when I read it, because everything today has made me cry. Everything! I'm home sick for the second day, some wicked combination of migraine and a virus, ache ache ache and shivery. Blind in my right eye from the migraine. I tried to ward it off yesterday by mad cleaning, but this morning I awakened to a sink full of dishes (from the lovely dinner I found the energy to prepare last night), and yet another stack of laundry (after I washed, dried, folded & put away 11 loads yesterday). And now I can't figure out how to make the DVD player work on this stoopid new TV my bro-in-law gave us. Hysterical crying out on my patio roost (which, by the way, does absolutely NOTHING to help alleviate a migraine). It's all due to lack of energy and feeling so flattened. I know that, in my head. My heart? I don't know. We bought this (our first) house 11 years ago, in fix-er-up condition because it's all we could afford. And we've done a gynormous amount of fixing up, but it seems it's multiplied exponentially. Fix one thing, 5 more appear. And you know what the economy is like. And you know I've now got TWO boys in college. And you know what that does to money for things like starting, let alone finishing, projects. I'm so sensitive to my environment, too, it doesn't help matters. I like serenity and order with just a LITTLE chaos thrown in. Relatively clean rooms, relatively MOST of the time. A little light gleaming off a pretty (clean) table vignette ... but not the kitchen table living in the living room, and kitchen shelves & cabinet doors lined up against a wall and all over the patio, forever it seems, and our roof project still undone after three years and KNOWING how pressed for time Double BB is. I want a wand, so I can wave it and have a home that's 'done', that isn't an embarrassment or a financial burden anymore. Not saying fancy, not saying stainless steel appliances, not saying walk-in closets or three kinds of molding on the ceilings. Just FINISHED. Our way. But today I'll just cry at how little Ciera is in her kindergarten picture, her backpack almost as big as she is, and at Roxanne's gentle painting and the picture of the grasses on her post, and at the dirty dishes in the sink (that I can't muster myself to wash, just yet), but especially out of gratefulness to my little feline, Zoe, because even though the door to my studio is open, she has elected instead of 'freedom' to curl up in my lap, blinking at me with contented emerald eyes, purring so loud and hard my belly is vibrating, and making chocolate pawlet dough on my left leg while pushing her head against my left arm for more pets and chin-scratching. [Photos from Gallivant Saturday] This in from my bro, Chris, yesterday: "Ciera is OFF to school! Wow. 3rd Grade already. She is half-excited and half-scared. I made sure she got a good night's sleep and a big breakfast."
It appears that people have Opinions about Trollope, especially about which Trollope a Trollope-virgin should Trollope with first&nbsp;(keyboard appears stuck on&nbsp;'Trollope').&nbsp; The consensii seemed to be one of The Warden, The Way We Live Now, and Can You Forgive Her? &nbsp; That last sounds deliciously salacious, but I went with the fairly short The Warden to start, due to my debilitating laziness. Laziness, you have been rewarded!&nbsp; The Warden is fantastic and sweet and a bit sad.&nbsp; Also, and I know that this is basting the turkey with Obvious Sauce, it is ridiculously Victorian.&nbsp; Because Septimus Harding is the warden of a hospital and the precentor of a cathedral and what are these things? Ok, I am still in the dark precentor-wise because Wikipedia is Too Much Work, but the warden of the hospital (which is not a 'hospital' like you're thinking, but more like an old-man charity house) is the guy who looks after the old mens.&nbsp; This is a bit complicated, but bear with me.&nbsp; A Benevolent Benefactor long ago set up said hospital along with a steady income.&nbsp; The income goes to maintain the hospital and feed the old mens, and whatever is left over goes to the warden.&nbsp; For reasons I don't understand (because I do not Get Economics), the income got bigger and suddenly the warden is making piles of money just for hanging out with some old mens. Which, fine.&nbsp; Except that some young reformer is all, NAY!&nbsp; Such injustice shall NOT go unprodded!&nbsp; And he starts prodding into what the Benevolent Benefactor's will actually stipulates and whether more of teh moneys should go to the old mens and whether the warden is living off of ill-gotten gains and then the warden starts wondering if he is living off of ill-gotten gains and did I mention that the young reformer and the warden's daughter ARE IN LOVE!?!?!&nbsp; Conflict!! So the warden is trying to figure out if he's doing a bad thing and the reformer is trying to figure out how to maintain the good opinion of his lady-love while prosecuting the hell out of her papa and the warden's son-in-law is trying to strong-arm the warden into standing up for his rights and then the press gets involved and everyone is quite overwrought. And that's sort of the whole of it.&nbsp;It is super. Cross-posted at books i done read. I think I liked the idea of this book more than the book itself. A gothic mystery/horror story set in Victorian London, featuring Charles Dickens and narrated by Wilkie Collins sounded like exactly the kind of book I would enjoy. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to its fascinating premise and I was left with mixed feelings about it. Drood is told in the form of a memoir written by Wilkie Collins (a close friend and collaborator of Charles Dickens, as well as being the author of The Woman in White, The Moonstone and many other novels and plays) and addressed to an unknown reader in the future – that is, to us. The story begins with the Staplehurst Rail Disaster of 1865, when the train on which Charles Dickens is travelling crashes, sending most of the carriages plummeting over a viaduct into the riverbed below. Luckily Dickens is in one of the few carriages that doesn't fall. As he helps to rescue people from the wreckage, he encounters a mysterious figure dressed in a black cape who introduces himself only as 'Drood'. In the days following the train crash, Dickens becomes obsessed with finding Drood and discovering his true identity. With the reluctant help of Wilkie Collins, Dickens begins a search for Drood which leads them through the dark alleys and underground catacombs of London. Interspersed with the Drood storyline are long passages in which we learn about the family life and living arrangements of both Dickens and Collins, how much they earned for their various novels, their walking tour of Cumberland in 1857, the details of Wilkie's laudanum addiction, the story of the Swiss chalet given to Dickens by his friend Charles Fechter, Dickens' interest in mesmerism and every other piece of biographical information you could possibly want to know. Simmons also incorporates some genuine historical letters and quotes which adds some authenticity to the book. I can see why some readers might find this boring, but I enjoyed these sections – I thought the descriptions of Dickens' reading tours were particularly fascinating. Simmons has attempted to imitate Wilkie Collins' narrative style (including the Victorian habit of talking directly to the reader) but I felt that he didn't get it quite right. He also uses a lot of words and phrases that just sound either too modern or too American to me (the real Collins or Dickens would have walked on the pavement rather than the sidewalk, for example). This is only a small complaint though, as overall, Dear Reader, I thought his style was quite convincing. I do like the way the book takes us through the process of researching and writing The Moonstone . However, some important plot points are given away so if you haven’t already read The Moonstone and think you might want to, then I would suggest you read it before you begin Drood. It might also be a good idea to read The Mystery of Edwin Drood first (I didn't and kept wishing I had). Another thing I liked about the book was the way Simmons deliberately tries to confuse and mislead the reader - at several points in the novel we are made to wonder whether something we've just read is real or an illusion. This journey through the cemeteries, opium dens and underground sewers of London is a good atmospheric read for a cold dark night, but I was slightly disappointed by it and despite reading all 775 pages I still can't decide whether I enjoyed it or not! However, it will almost certainly leave you wanting to learn more about Dickens and Collins and their works, which can only be a good thing. If you like this type of book I would also recommend The Quincunx by Charles Palliser - another book set in Victorian England and written in a 19th century style. Before I come to the end of this review I would just like to say a few words in defence of poor Wilkie Collins, who happens to be one of my favourite authors. Simmons clearly doesn't rate Wilkie as a writer (I saw an interview where he described him as 'mediocre') and in Drood , the character is portrayed as a not very talented, second-rate author who is consumed with jealousy of the more successful Dickens and becomes increasingly bitter and unlikeable as the book goes on. I admit I'm biased because I've absolutely loved every Wilkie Collins book I've read; he was a much better writer than Drood suggests and definitely not mediocre, at least in my opinion! -Pictures of Charles Dickens (top) and Wilkie Collins (bottom) both in the public domain Helen Loves Books The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&nbsp; by Anne Bronte (1848-409 pages) The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the second and last&nbsp; novel written by Anne Bronte in her twenty nine years (1820 to 1849). &nbsp;&nbsp; Last month I read and posted on her first work, Agnes Grey. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is told in a very interesting way. &nbsp;&nbsp; It is a novel very rooted in its time and place. &nbsp;&nbsp; The book is divided into three sections and each is told from a different point of view and narrated in a different fashion. &nbsp; Part One is from the point of view of Gilbert, a well off farmer. &nbsp; A mysterious woman, a widow and her son, have moved into Wildfell Hall, a once grand mansion. &nbsp;&nbsp; Gilbert begins to court the widow, Helen Graham and loses interest in the woman his mother wanted him to marry. &nbsp; In a search for revenge, this woman begins to spread gossip about Helen. &nbsp; &nbsp; One needs to keep in mind that in the time and place of the novel a woman was not thought complete without a man and any single woman, widow or otherwise, above the age of twenty five or so was seen as a potential threat to the stability of the community and its morals. &nbsp;&nbsp; A friend of Gilbert's is also seemingly courting Helen. &nbsp; When Gilbert behaves in a jealous fashion, Helen gives Gilbert her diaries to read. The diary reveals her abusive marriage to Arthur Huntington. &nbsp;&nbsp; Helen begins the marriage completely in love. &nbsp; Over time Arthur seems to become bored with her company and prefers to spend his time with friends from his days prior to marriage. &nbsp; These friends lead him back into a life of heavy drinking and partying with women of dubious repute in the company of male friends. &nbsp; He becomes abusive to her and he tries to turn her son to his ways, teaching him to disrespect his mother and use improper language. &nbsp; In a move of extreme boldness for her day, Helen left Arthur. &nbsp;&nbsp; There some interesting twists and turns of the plot and throughout it all Helen behaves in a near saintly fashion, returning to her abusive husband to nurse him&nbsp; through a fatal disease. Part 3 begins when Helen leaves Wildfell Hall. &nbsp; We see Anne has kept some secrets from us. &nbsp; &nbsp; The ending is much like the ending of Agnes Grey . &nbsp; I liked several things about this book. &nbsp; I liked Anne Bronte's use of differing narrative modes for different sections of the book. &nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed the conversations in the book a lot. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall shows Anne was rapidly developing as an artist, compared with her first work. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wildfell Hall is one of the first novels showing a woman leaving an abusive husband. &nbsp; &nbsp; The abusive husband is a bit of a stereotype of the times (hence the name Huntington meaning he prefers the pleasure of the hunt to the company of his wife). &nbsp;&nbsp; You can see how deeply Anne felt alcohol was at the root of the problems in her marriage. &nbsp; She was very unhappy when her husband began to teach their son to drink. &nbsp;&nbsp; The novel is rooted in the time as there is no longer any great mysterious stigma that attached to a single woman with a child as there was in England in the 1840s.&nbsp; (Or perhaps one should say a single woman not of the poorer and majority class of people.) &nbsp; &nbsp; The world of women is a small one in the novels of Anne Bronte. &nbsp; She explores its limits very well. I read Wildfell Hall in part because I have decided to read all of the novels of the Bronte Sisters. &nbsp; There are only seven of them and I like feeling closure on a reading project. &nbsp;&nbsp; As I was reading I could not help but wonder if almost everyone reads her works mainly because of who her ates were . &nbsp; ("Ate" is a tagalog word for "big sister" that conveys for me the familial relationship between Anne and her sisters. &nbsp;&nbsp; A young sister or brother will call&nbsp; their older&nbsp; sibling "Ate Jane" and it is meant to convey respect for an elder sister.) &nbsp; &nbsp; Wildfell Hall is worth reading on its own. &nbsp;&nbsp; Her work does not have the power, depth and beauty of&nbsp; the work of her ates but not much does. &nbsp;&nbsp; I really thing anyone into the Brontes, the Victorian novel or 19th century women writers should read all of&nbsp; the Bronte novels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mel u The Reading Life &nbsp; click on poster for link to trailer Corey and I had a date night tonight to go see the new Alice in Wonderland movie. We saw in 3D. Alice is 19 years old and has dreams about the happenings of the original movies.... My thoughts are....... that it was just okay. We will not be taking the kids to see it at the theater. First and foremost, I think they would be bored. The beginning is very slow to get going and the plot would kind of be over their heads I think with her being rebellious about corsets and stockings, and then attending a party that turns out to be her engagement party. That doesn't ruin the plot I don't think. She eventually chases after the white rabbit and falls in the rabbit hole...etc., etc. It was very much like the movies I have seen before..just different looking. The plot is a little different but several of the same things happen, but with less "childishness" about them. My conclusion is that...it wasn't serious and deep enough to make it very interesting for adults, but it wasn't childish and silly enough to make it fully appropriate for children either. The gruesome aspects (stepping on human heads to cross a moat, monster eyes being plucked out by straight pins) make it just too much for little kids, so then the lack of more makes it slightly too simple for adults. I think it should have gone one more step one way or the other. It does look very interesting and beautiful. The 3D affects are great. There are some really funny parts with the Red Queen when she goes on her tirades, but I don't think kids would "get it." The March Hare is pretty funny. The Mad Hatter is typical of what you would expect with Johnny Depp playing that part. The White Queen is whimsical. There is a good message of good conquering evil and the Red Queen's demise. I even picked up on some easy to make comparisons between the overall story/characters/storyline and Christianity. Overall...if I were rating on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being Mystery Science Theater level and 10 being like Epic Life Changing Films...I would give it a ....... 6. I would watch it again maybe, the story is good because the story was already good, but it will be hard to find the just right age for our kids so we can watch it together as a family. Better versions of this movie have already been made, in my opinion the Disney one is the best because it makes me laugh a lot! Even though they said it is not supposed to be "the original movie" it kind of is. A good version, but disappointed because it could have been so much better. I think the fault lies with whoever wrote the screenplay. This movie completes my Victorian Film Mini-Movie Challenge. I didn't even realize it until I was posting on my other blog and saw the list of what I had already completed. Although most of this film is NOT set in the regular Victorian setting, it is for part of the time and the essence is there, even in Wonderland, or "Underland" as it is called in this film. Ok so, I read this a long time ago before I understood things like 'subtlety' and I was all, What?&nbsp; This isn't scary.&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real. But now ACK!&nbsp; Those ghosts probably aren't even real!!! So a bunch of people are sitting around telling ghost stories over Christmas (you know, as one does ) and this one guy is all, I have a story that will chill you!&nbsp; But it's at home and I have to send for it, so you can all go ahead and wait.&nbsp; And that's how tenterhooks were born. The story finally arrives and he reads it and its this governess who takes a position looking after two wee chillens who are beautiful and perfect and good and innocent (which is sort of freaky on its own, no?) except that maybe they are communicating with and/or possessed by some wicked ghosts.&nbsp; Because the governess keeps seeing said ghosts, who are apparently the valet and the previous governess (who got knocked up by said valet and drowned herself in the lake [allegedly]), and they appear to be trying to get the children.&nbsp; Except that whenever the ghosts appear, the children make a POINT of REALLY DELIBERATELY not seeing them, even though the governess is sure they do.&nbsp; It's pretty sinister. But then also maybe the children really don't see the ghosts because there are no ghosts because the governess is going mad?&nbsp; Because maybe they make a point of really deliberately not seeing them because they actually don't see them because&nbsp; they aren't there ?!?!?&nbsp; And the housekeeper doesn't seem them, even when they're right there but maybe she just doesn't have that ability?&nbsp; And I realize that I'm not making this sound very scary and loads of people read TotS and don't stay up nights but few things&nbsp;terrify my shit more&nbsp;than ambiguity.&nbsp; Except maybe sharks. I also feel like I should shoot you a disclaimer here and let you know that James is a mad&nbsp;over-commafier and no one thought to&nbsp;pelt him with&nbsp;periods, so his sentences get rull long and Victorian.&nbsp; Not like Lisa Appignanesi's do , to the point where you totally lose track 
f where the sentence started, but enough to exhaust the old temporal lobe.&nbsp; But I find him Worth It. Cross-posted at books i done read . Montmorency is a thief. A common criminal, doing time in one of Victorian London's notorious prison in 1875. But what makes him a different than many criminals is that he's very smart, and that he is lucky enough to have a benefactor of sorts -- a brilliant doctor who saved his life. While fleeing the police after a robbery attempt, Montmorency he crashed through a factory skylight and landed on an enormous machine, and would have died from his injuries if an ambitious young doctor hadn't wanted to use him as a test case. A year after his accident, following multiple painful surgeries, the thief who is known as Montmorency (an alias he has adopted, from the name on the bag of tools he was clutching as he fell) is routinely trotted out for meetings of the Victorian scientific community. He's prodded and poked like a laboratory animal, while the upper-crusties are treating him like some kind of rare zoo exhibit, Montmorency, a bright young man with an excellent memory, is actually studying them, and storing away all sorts of useful information. He's not stealing valuables items any more -- just valuable ideas.&nbsp; After one such exhibition, Montmorency absorbs up a very interesting piece of information: a map of the newly renovated London sewer system. Montmorency realizes that this would be the perfect escape route for a thief, and for the rest of his incarceration, he begins planning. He will use his burglary skills and newfound knowledge to reinvent himself as a gentleman. I really enjoyed this book. Of course, I'm currently fascinated by the Victorian period, but this book was both well-written historical novel and an exciting adventure/crime story. Though I personally would never have the nerve to burglarize, it's fun to imagine -- I do love heist movies and crime capers, so there you go. I think Upland did a good job imagining any plot holes and figuring out plausible explanations as to how Montmorency is able to pull off a double life as a Victorian gentleman (a trick in itself) and a thief that spends his nights in the slimy sewers of London without getting caught. He does encounter all kinds of setbacks and dangers. I do wish that Updale had given more details about the actual burglaries -- once it's established that he's a thief, she doesn't give many examples of the crimes, just the fact that he's a burglar. Also, she doesn't flesh out too much of his character -- Montmorency is so busy trying to reinvent himself, yet the reader learns next to nothing about his history, not even his real name. A little more detail would have been great. Since this is the first in the series of four, I suspect the reader will get more information in the later volumes. While I do recommend Montmorency , I have to point out that there is extensive discussion, especially in the beginning, about the filth of the London sewer system and everything that's in there -- and fairly explicit descriptions of the sanitation systems of Victorian prisons. If you have a weak stomach, you might want to skim those chapters. I like to read while I eat, but I would not recommend this book for mealtime&nbsp;reading until you get past about Chapter 13. It's short, only 233 pages, and a fast read. This volume of the Montmorency series is also available on audiobook, narrated by the wonderful Stephen Fry (aka Wooster from PBS' Jeeves &amp; Wooster). I've already put Monmorency Book #2 on hold at the library. Sadly, though there are several copies of the first book in my library system (which has 24 branches) they only own one of each of the remaining books in the series. It's too bad this book isn't more popular.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe if all the teens read it, they'll get hooked on Victorians and we'll have a whole new generation of lit lovers. This is book #4 for Our Mutual Read challenge. In some ways, this reminds me of Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky which is another instance in which the story behind a book is just as interesting as the book itself. My first online search for information about The Bondwoman's Narrative pulled up not information about the narrative itself, but an outline of events about Henry Louis Gates Jr's discovery and analysis of the manuscript, the proposed theories surrounding its authorship by Hannah Crafts (a pseudonym), and its journey to publication. Which admittedly is fascinating. I'd been unsure whether to include this Virago Modern Classic in this month's reading, but the story behind the story cinched the deal for me. As fascinating as it is, however, I became more interested in the story behind the story and almost forgot about the narrative itself; there are about a hundred pages of text before the novel begins and the introduction is engaging, but in its efforts to illuminate the various possible identities for Hannah Crafts, much of the story's plot is revealed along with abundant information about the actions of the characters therein. I would have preferred the introduction be presented as an appendix (but this is a pet peeve of mine, being so spoiler-phobic, and simultaneously being an orderly reader who would prefer to begin at the beginning and read straight through); but, the appendices are filled with their own interesting information (e.g. detailed description of how the manuscript was authenticated) so there wasn't much room there for more, I'd guess. So I read about 20 pages of the Introduction and then I jumped ahead to read the novel, and I jumped back to the Introduction when I had finished Hannah Craft's novel. butButBUT...the backstory is gripping and vital, contextually, to a more complete understanding of The Bondwoman's Narrative , so I am not actually complaining about this (even if it kinda sounds that way). Here's the thing though: forget about all the history behind it for a second... The Bondwoman's Narrative is a gripping tale. Apparently the author was heavily influenced by books like Bleak House and Jane Eyre (I've only read Jane Eyre of those two, but I'm not sure I would have spotted the connections, although scholars have pointed out many direct similarities between TBW'sN and these two texts) and there are all kinds of creepy and dramatic events that pull the reader into the story. A hatchet with hair still stuck to the heft, trees haunted by spirits still furious at their unjust treatment while alive, women driven mad, conniving business dealings (and, yes, this includes the business of human trade): this is not a dry, historical narrative, but a fantastic yarn. Nonetheless, a yarn with considerable import. As potentially the first known novel written by an African American woman, this novel is significant for being one of few of that time period that took the author's race as the norm. Unlike other narratives of that time period, which were sometimes even written under pseudonyms by white women pretending to write an "escape-from-slavery" chronicle (true abolitionists or simply opportunists who envied Harriet Beecher Stowe's incredible success with her 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin ), the black characters in The Bondwoman's Narrative are never described in stereotypical terms and the presumption is that characters are black, unless otherwise described. This is the exception rather than the rule for manuscripts dating to this time period, so it's certainly possible to read this novel for scholarly reasons, but too much emphasis on its importance might discourage readers who, if they just approached this as a 19th-Century Sentimental novel, might just find it a good read. Surely a book can be both: important and enjoyable. Anyone else read something lately that they were surprised to find themselves truly enjoying, even though they might have originally chosen the book because it was culturally or historically significant? I am running out of cliches to express how much Sarah Waters rocks me like a hurricane.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; She is amazeballs.&nbsp; When she is good, she is very, very good and when she is bad, she is still pretty damned good.&nbsp; Admit it, The Night Watch only kind of sucked because it wasn't Fingersmith . And to be fair, Affinity ?&nbsp; Also not Fingersmith .&nbsp; Ok but come on, you guys.&nbsp; SPIRIT MEDIUMS and SECRETS and spinster ladies who are recovering from the deaths of their fathers and then also something else horrible that they're not telling you about and also VICTORIAN LADY PRISONS.&nbsp; You would like read. Ok so.&nbsp; Margaret is a spinster lady who is visiting women in prison because that is the sort of benevolent thing ladies did in those days, to guide them in the ways of not being felons, and also&nbsp;so that the benevolent ladies didn't go stark raving mad while living at home with their mothers and being spinsters.&nbsp; Also, something horrible happened to her and no one is talking about it but everyone is mentioning it obliquely and&nbsp;glancing significantly at everyone else.&nbsp; Prepare to feel out of the loop. But then Margaret meets Selina, prisoner-slash-spirit-medium, and if you are at all familiar with La Waters you will be all I SEE YOU COMING, LADY ROMANCE!&nbsp; And if you are not, well, you have eyes.&nbsp; And I really want other things to have happened so that I can delineate them for you, but for the rest of the novel Margaret goes to visit Selina in prison and that is sort of it for&nbsp; many, many pages &nbsp;then something Fairly Unexpected happens at the end.&nbsp; So. And it is awesome and atmsopheric and there may or may not be spooks.&nbsp; Waters can toss a word salad like she was born to it.&nbsp; I...literally have nothing else to say about this novel.&nbsp; I'm going to start just putting 'ditto' for all of my Waters reviews.
Alarm clock buzz, shower time, corn flakes with bananas, ride to work, work-work-work, hit the gym, socialize, dinner, zzzzs and repeat.A few people have asked why I haven't written.  The first response is that I have been working all day, everyday, but when I really thought about it, I didn't have anything exciting to write about.  How about that... life in Kabul is normal. Sure I have some funny stories, but they are not PG-rated, so you are going to need to skype me for those. A month ago, when I was getting on a plane, never would I have though that life in Kabul would feel so (dare I say it) normal.   Wednesday I am going to a new yoga class and Friday we are going shopping.  Today was so beautiful I spent 3 hours reading reports outside in the gleaming sunshine.  Everyday, I meet more fantastically brilliant people.  The work is getting better by the day.There are down sides, as there are to anything, but I prefer to look up.  So as I settled in, I would love to hear about your adventures.
there is a lot of life happening over here. i know when i get caught up in the what if's and the oh i should have's i start to get a little crazy. and let's face it, a little mean. so, when i feel that creep up on me i have to take a few seconds, a few minutes to sit and be quiet. i prefer for those minutes to involve the camera, or food, but life doesn't always give you what you want, does it? like right now i'd really like a big fat blt with fresh summer tomatoes. ah well. maybe in a few months. in the meantime, read this post from brian which struck the right note with me, and make sure to click through and read the night kitchen article. the collaboration between Lisa Congdon and myself is available for sale now at Rare Device . go for it! i sorta dissappeared, huh? i've been traveling for work again, but this time working in an office. it's a different feeling. i'll be getting back out into the field again this summer, but in the meantime i'm adjusting myself to cubicle walls. not that there is much adjusting to be had with drab grey fabric covered walls. seriously. oof. on an up note, i visited trader joe's for the first time ever in my life. i am now crippled with an addiction to mochi ice cream . wow. i just drooled a little bit. to keep my sanity (and not watch hours of tv) i've been reading and streaming the new oriole post album. so good. really. like buy it. it's on itunes and amazon. there is a link on their site under music. yes, they are my friends, but let me tell you, i'm what you might call a direct person. and as a direct person i wouldn't tell you to buy something if i didn't like it myself. so there is that. i'll have a little something else to tell you about in a week. a super exciting collaboraiton. ok, i'm off to pollo loco (i'm such a california cliche). i've got good people in my life. lots of them. in a week that has resulted in a large amount of stress being put right up on my shoulders, it has been exceedingly clear that who is in your life makes all the difference in the world. who could ask for more than that? certainly not me. i was asked to go to socal for a project meeting for work. they really had to twist my arm. really twist hard. heading back out of town again tomorrow. i managed to keep up with my 365 project, and i discovered the power of hothands , which i also put in my boots. this week is supposed to be colder, and i'm wondering if i can tape hothands all over my entire body. would that be strange? maybe a bit, even in arkansas. never did get my hands on that flask. oh well. eleven more months to go. it probably comes as no surprise that i am not the least bit sad to see january go. the closer we get to other months that start with j, the better. i suspect that february is going to be a doozy. i've got two weeks of fieldwork before me, and it has been suggested that the best way to stay warm would be to buy one of these and fill it with whiskey. obviously i have some smart friends. now that eliot's birthday is officially past, i am receiving daily reminders that arlo's is next. and that i should buy something pink and purple that she likes. i'm still not sure what that something is, because that's as specific as she is getting. occasionally she will throw out the word cozy. we'll see. it's hard to think of buying more things when all i want to do is get rid of 60% of the things in my closet. did you see maria's ruthless guidelines ? i plan on getting down to business as soon as i get back and thaw myself. and i've still got those throw pillows on the back burner. sheesh. it would be absolutely true to say that in many ways eliot changed my life. he is my firstborn child. before eliot, i was not a mother. after, well, i guess the after is pretty obvious. but here is the thing, eliot is a great kid. like really great. like it's hard for me to believe sometimes that he is the person he is. did we make this? how can this be? did he just say what i think he did? how did he get so smart? why is he so sweet? this stream of questions has been running through my brain for the last eight years. i still have no answers, apart from the person you see before you. all i know is that if eliot were not my son, he is still someone i would be happy to know, and count as a friend. happy birthday son. when i think of you all grown up, i can see the best person possible. i love you.
Tonight I took a step back in time. I took a dance class. Since the age of six, I took dance classes, and the dance studio became a haven for me. Home was confusing or frightening, school was awkward and stressful, but the dance studio was just comfort- something I was good at that gave me the opportunity to divert my attention away from everything else. You can’t focus on anything else during a dance class—nothing but the music, the steps and your own rhythm. I continued taking classes all through high school and even into college, but the last time I was in a studio in a class was over 18 years ago. EIGHTEEN. I thought about that number in the car on the way to the studio. 18 years. That was probably going to be the age of most of the women in the class. So they were NEWBORNS the last time I was in a studio. I was lucky enough to find an adult class in the first place, much less only a mile from my house. I knew I needed to go. I called months ago about the class and every week, something came up (real or not-so-real) that kept me from going. I know I need to exercise and be healthy. I want to lose weight. And the only type of exercising that appeals to me is the main form I spent most of my young life doing. So taking a cue from my last blog post—I ran out of reasons to wait. I got to the studio early and was almost overwhelmed at the response I had just moments in the door. A ballet class was finishing up, the students all around the age of 14. I felt such a sense of familiarity and nostalgia standing there, the music blaring, watching these girls—remembering when this was all second nature to me—when being in a dance studio was when I felt the most “right” and comfortable. That was when I started asking myself why I had waited so long to come back to dance. I knew I wasn’t going to be as light on my feet, or walk into the studio with the confidence I used to. I knew I was out of shape and a LOT older than I was the last time I was here…but it was a part of me—who I am—who I was---a part of my life I loved and enjoyed very much for many years. I was a bundle of nerves watching the students file in for my class. All younger, most with tiny dancer frames, with varying levels of experience. I actually had butterflies when the teacher came to the front of the room to begin. For a second I eyed the door, afraid I would make a fool of myself. Then, the teacher jumped right in, starting the music from a remote in her hand, and I didn’t have time to think. It was hard. I definitely learned how out of shape I was—and the figure I saw in the mirror seemed foreign to me—having stared at my much younger and thinner self in dance studio mirrors for so many years. But I was keeping up and sticking it out. I had told myself beforehand that no matter what, I had to make it through the whole class. And although I was sweating and breathing harder than I had in awhile, there was no question about me making it through the entire class because I was having such a great time. I remembered why I loved dancing so much. The freedom of expression- that beautiful unison of a group of dancers in sync, creating something graceful while exercising out stress, worry, and excess energy. The other thing I used to love was the kinship between dancers—an unspoken respect for each other—and an understanding of the desire to make each step right, have each beat spoken for. And tonight, one of the most wonderful surprises came from my fellow students. I was definitely the lowest level dancer there, had trouble with some steps, couldn’t find my footing in more than a few instances. The younger girls especially were so sweet and encouraging—cheering when I got a tough combination (finally) that we had to do one by one across the floor. Not an ounce of judgment or questioning why I was in “their” class. So touching and exactly what I remembered from my fellow dancers so many years ago. I know tomorrow morning I will be reminded of just how out of shape I am, and will discover pain in muscles I didn’t know I had. But I will also remember how I felt when I walked in that studio earlier tonight and heard those first beats of music. I was ready to step back out on the dance floor. In early 2008, I was talking to a friend about the writing career I wanted that I feared would never happen. She looked at me, incredulous, and asked, “What are you waiting for?" The words couldn’t have been simpler. And I didn’t have an answer. What was I doing, really? Was I hoping that magically it would just happen ? I couldn’t believe how focused that moment made me feel. I had been expressing how much I wanted something for years, but what was I really doing about it—except wishing? And so, I did start writing, focusing, setting small goals and meeting them. And although JK Rowling and I aren’t sharing an agent (yet), I feel closer to my goal than ever. And I know those five words started it. As of late, I have felt other parts of my life coming together—or at least beginning to. And I realize how much time I have wasted over the years waiting&nbsp;for so many things. Waiting for a boys to call, waiting for the right moment to do this or try that, waiting for a job I hated to get better, waiting for my family to change so I could heal, waiting…waiting… Some waiting is necessary. You can’t control everything. But too many times in my life I took a passive role when I was scared or unsure of myself. Too many times I thought I would wait just a little longer, just in case—even though I knew in my heart that nothing was going to change, or that I needed to head in the opposite direction. There are also small instances of waiting that I watch myself and others I am close to fall back on every day. The little things we put off that lead to big things... I will start eating healthier next week, I will actually take a vacation next year, I will start exercising when the weather is better, I will take that art class I have always wanted to when I have more time… For the last few years, I didn’t want photos taken of me—because I felt so self conscious about my weight. I would purposely avoid all pictures—including some at very large company events I was so proud to have pulled off and some very special occasions with dear friends that I just couldn’t bear to be photographed in. As a result, there are years now with holes—memories without me in them when I was a central part—all because I was waiting until I felt better about how I looked to include myself in recording them. I realize now how silly that sounds—and the reasons run deeper than appearance. But I was once again waiting for something to get better—for ME to get better before I allowed myself to enjoy life fully. Waiting can feel safe, but now I am training myself to ask if I feel safe and comfortable—or scared. Am I waiting for the right reasons? As some parts of my life begin to feel safe and dependable in the best senses of the word, I am learning what I can trust and who I can lean on—what parts of my life I can sink into and enjoy, knowing I am in the right place. There are areas of my life that are still broken and in need of repair and that may take time. But I am no longer relying on some magic solution to make it all happen. I am living in all of the moments- scared, painful, happy, uncertain, perfect or broken. And life is more real and vivid than it has ever been—and incredibly unpredictable. Just what I have been waiting for. "You must be the change you wish to see in the world." -Mahatma Gandhi With all the gloom in the headlines as of late, I came upon this story about The Same Café in Denver, Colorado where everyone—regardless of their ability to pay—gets a beautiful meal, some comfort, a great does of dignity, and probably most important of all—a moment as part of their community instead of a statistic or problem to be solved. My words won’t add too much impact to the story itself, except to say I am inspired, and when I watch something like this I try and think of just one small thing I can do to make some kind of difference for anyone—within the next day or week. It reminds me why I love that quote in the first place. It is a reminder and a challenge—a call to action. A call these owners have taken to heart --and have given as a gift to their community. For more great stories like this about people making a difference, you can follow the MSNBC series Making a Difference on twitter here . Over the years, throughout the six or so cities I have called home, a letter or email would come from my high school reunion committee. For awhile, they even seemed to lose track of me—not a hard thing to do—as I have moved more than any one person I know. I was fine with that. I really had no desire to revisit an extremely awkward time in my life—and all the players seemed frozen in time-just as we all were then. That was fine by me, too. In a way, it made me feel better. At least back then, so many people expected so much of me—so many high hopes. If no one knew differently, I had achieved everything I was supposed to. So much so that I couldn’t be bothered to make it into town for a visit with old friends, past acquaintances, and school crushes. The truth was, of course, completely the opposite, at least in my eyes. I imagined a party—all the familiar faces, and whispers behind plastic drinking cups about one another. How wonderful so-and-so looked. How so-and-so hadn’t changed a bit. And of course what people would think of me. Not married, a bit uncertain of my future, and weighing a few more pounds than I would have liked. So when several close friends began encouraging me to join Facebook, I wasn’t the least bit interested. At the time, the only real social networking I was familiar with was My Space, mainly through my friend’s teenage children, and the thought of anyone my age spending time online for such a purpose seemed ludicrous. I couldn’t imagine why anyone would want to do such a thing. What a waste of time. As one of my friends went on to explain status updates and how you could share what you were doing at any given moment—I thought surely she had lost her mind. Who does this? I can’t remember when I&nbsp;finally took the leap, although I think it might have been to prove to that very friend (and myself) what a bunch of nonsense the whole thing was. And at first, it did seem that way to me. Then, a few friend requests popped up. Some faces I instantly recognized, others sent me to my bookshelf to find my yearbooks, turning pages—remembering—and a bit shocked that some of these people remembered me at all. I had felt invisible for a lot of high school and there was something revealing in knowing I was seen. As my friend list grew, I rekindled relationships with people from my past, kindergarten classmates, friends of friends…acquaintances I met through past jobs, through travel, and through the other random moments in life. I found children I was a nanny for in college, all grown up with the same three year old grin hidden somewhere in their expression, and magically recreated in their own toddler’s faces. It became all a little bit—captivating. No longer were all these people frozen in time---judging me and what I hadn’t done—it startles me to think how self centered and more than a little paranoid that thinking was. My own fears made me believe no one could see past well, the past, when it was me that was stuck in time, forgetting that we all step through trap doors, miss our chances, take new directions. We all do. And we become who we are because of it. Even my closest friends that I stay in constant contact with have become dearer to me. I do know what they are doing at any given moment when they feel like sharing, and it is a gift. I no longer just hear from Judith through emails or the occasional call. I know that she just got great news, or shares pictures of her son’s visit from college, and I get to be a part of her life again—just as I did when I lived around the corner from her in Atlanta, even though we now live five hours apart. I join in my friends' joy as they add to their families and share pictures of moments I would have otherwise completely missed. I see us all growing up, doing everything all over the map. And all my paranoid visions of judgment are laughable now. The love and support from people I once only knew from Algebra class and school field trips now encourage me before a job interview or send snarky comments to me when I need to laugh. My heart swells when someone is in crisis, or worries in the ER for a sick child, and a group of Facebook warriors from all across the globe keep thoughts and prayers flowing through message after message lighting up the screen at all hours. It has been a learning experience, and for any naysayers about social media, there is something so connected, real and genuine about it all, and I can honestly say it has enriched my life. In those small snippets of text that grace the main pages, there is humor, wisdom, sadness, and acceptance. And for me, there has been more. It is how I met the person I love. Through careful steps, shared memories, and more than a little trepidation, we got to know each other. And I am absolutely certain I would never have been able to open my heart any other way. Coming from a shared background, knowing his past, him knowing mine, others knowing both of us (and encouraging a romance)—it was the perfect formula for me to step back into the world of trust. And I did, one status update at a time. I constantly search for a way to quiet my mind once it starts whirling—a way to stop thinking, worrying, and fretting. At times when I feel overwhelmed, I need something to escape into. For many years, cooking has been a source of passion and comfort for me-- a way to sink into something else and change my focus. Having been single for more years than I would like to count, it has too often seemed a waste, or at times too costly to do the kind of cooking I like to do. Nothing makes me happier than a crowd to cook for. I love all of it—the planning, choosing recipes, finding out who likes what, and then the shopping, preparation and unveiling the finished product. To me it is sharing love, giving of myself, and I enjoy so much watching others enjoy a good meal—and the camaraderie and laughter that accompany it. I never questioned whether or not I would be able to cook…it was something I saw my mother and my grandmother instinctively do—with rarely a cookbook or recipe card in sight. I assumed it was a learned behavior like reading or riding a bike. I do believe that part of that mentality is from a southern upbringing. At least from my mother's point of view, it seemed expected for a woman to be a good cook—it was all part of getting (and keeping) a husband. But for all of the backwards and sometimes time-warped southern traditions, I am thankful that learning to cook--feeling the need to cook is in my DNA. In my grandmother’s tiny mountain cabin, which lacked a full plumbing system, and barely enough room for all of us to stand- let alone sit- in her house, she created aromas I am not sure have been replicated to date, even though my mother holds many of the recipes. Her gravy and biscuits still makes me ache for Sunday mornings, and even though I have watched my mother countless times, and have made more attempts than I care to mention, I can’t make them taste the same. Because my mother grew up very poor, my grandmother’s cooking skills were put even more to the test, trying to stretch a thin budget to feed five children. Even still, my mother recalls my grandmother’s dishes with great admiration and nostalgia, and these same dishes have graced our table over the years. And while growing up things in my house were strained, tough, and at times incredibly unhappy—some of the few peaceful times we shared as our disconnected silhouette of a family were around the dinner table. Looking back, it was almost as if when the kitchen timer sounded—all the chaos took a time out for dinner. My mother was and has always been an excellent cook, and many nights out of the week, we sat down to a great meal. There is a calming effect with food—the anticipation, savoring, the focus. In the midst of the end of a workday, an argument, or just a swirl of activity, everything has to sl
w down, at least somewhat. For me, cooking was always a little for daydreaming, too. I always imagined honing my skills, and how I would one day be a wife and mother, preparing meals for my family—my fresh start—to heal and begin anew. Over the years as that seemed further from reality, I still took comfort in cooking for my friends, coworkers, and my surrogate family members throughout all the cities I lived in. And so many times when I was concentrating on the dreams that I didn’t see coming true, I didn’t realize that in many of my closest friend’s houses, the kitchen brought me a sense of family. I think of Judith’s kitchen in Atlanta, sharing so many meals in her home, the back of the house awash with light over early dinners of “mom’s special dish” (her son’s favorite). I think of “Nanny Rice” made with so much love in Debby’s kitchen in NC that I grew up associating it with comfort and her heart for me. I think of cooking meals at Patrick and Kristin’s house for friends and for their little girls, remembering when they still sat in booster seats giggling at me from across the table. And in just the last few weeks, my best friend Kim and I have shared and made each other’s recipes more than once. She is my teacher as of late, and I love knowing I have her expertise at any moment. As I made a pot of homemade soup tonight at the end of a stressful day—after too many worries about money, work, and tough decisions- I found myself slowing down, as I chopped and sliced, sautéed and stirred. And a little bit of each of those kitchens—from my grandmother’s to Judith’s to Debby’s—and finally, my own-- helped me ease my mind and feel a sense of comfort and family. And there is nothing more delicious than that. There are times when&nbsp;I spend hours on a blog post, sorting through all my thoughts and sentences, wearing the pages of my thesaurus thin, not able to connect the exact meaning with my keystrokes. I always have a feeling of accomplishment when I am done--believing at least that I have gotten as close as I can. Sometimes the words resonate with readers and sometimes they don't, but I know I said what I wanted or needed to say. Then, there are times when the words flow, when I can't get them down fast enough...it is almost stressful to write at a quick enough pace before I forget where my mind is heading. More often than not, these writing bursts happen late at night (or early in the morning)--as my nightowl tendencies lend me to greater creative connectivity past the hours of midnight. And many times, those streaming thoughts are the ones that seem to connect--I know there is more of a purity there. My last post, No Other Way ,&nbsp;was one of those entries. I wrote it from beginning to end in a matter of minutes, and got some comments and emails so touching in response, that I was teary-eyed. I even printed a few out for inspiration. But, mainly I was so heartened. I know that I have battled some of the darkest bouts of depression a person could ever go through, and have experienced so much seemingly bad luck in my life that&nbsp;my friends often commented to me that it seemed at times like a black cloud followed me. When in those midnight-black places, I didn't want to hear from anyone that things could get better. It seemed like empty words coming from people who could not possible understand my pain or the sheer impossibility of getting to the other side. And then, every now and then, I would read an article, a story, an essay, or a blog post and someone's words would reach me. I would see shared circumstances and find something that gave me a glimmer. Or, as in the case of Matt Logelin's blog , I would read about someone in completely different circumstances, but whose strength and grace just made me believe&nbsp;that I, too, could keep going.&nbsp;Those moments could sustain me for long periods of time. So often when I share something of my life, the responses and stories I get in return from readers blow me away. The grace, survival, humor and ability to put it all into words is so touching and beautiful, and we all never really recognize how amazing our own stories are. And although my life is far from perfect, I do know that I would never, ever have believed all the amazing things that have happened to me in the last year. Two years ago, I was so far away from all this--and if you are reading this--and if you need these words--please read them and know them to be true. Even from the bottom of a seemingless bottomless pit, everything can change. Everything. It may not all be perfect, but it can be happy and hopeful, and more than you thought possible. It can. I promise. And for so many of us creative souls, writing is therapy, healing, and sanity. Write-- put it all down. It doesn't have to be poetic. Even when I look back on some of my most heartbreaking journal entries or blog posts, I am so thankful I have those words--laced with all that pain. Because looking back, I know how far I have come, how little hope I had, and how nothing is ever written in stone. And for anyone else who has come out of these dark places, whatever they may be...someone out there needs to hear your words of survival and hope. So share, trust yourself. It may make all the difference. It did for me. I am thankful- for decisions I didn’t get to make… dreams that fell through- love lost. I am thankful- for all the things that went wrong. The turns in my life that cut me to pieces- the long journey back to making myself whole. I am thankful- for almost falling into the abyss Being pulled back against my will- almost angry that I survived. I am thankful that I couldn’t imagine such happiness because it is sweeter now that I doubted it with such intensity. It is easy to be thankful for beauty. Who would have ever thought I would be so thankful for the very worst things? The missed chances, defeat, dark places I dare not revisit. The outcomes I fought with all my might to change- to bend- to make what I thought I needed. But nothing worked. I lost those battles over and over. For that I am most thankful. There was no other way. I know that now. I found myself again. It’s been a long time. I am here. Right where I am supposed to be. And in ways I could never have imagined… I am thankful. I have featured this painting before--It is "Rebirth" by Duy Huynh, a local artist. This painting has always held special meaning for me-as does a lot of his other work. Please check out more of his work here: http://larkandkey.com/ My mother called a few days ago, with the pattern of random small talk that I recognize well. She was upset about something. While she chattered on about the weather or her recent purchase of new placemats for the kitchen, she was trying to find the courage to say what was really on her mind. Finally, in a quiet voice, almost a whisper, she said: You didn’t send us a card for our anniversary. We have been married for fifty years , this was special. I was just surprised. Fifty years. I knew when their anniversary was. My mother has never been subtle or able to hold back excitement for any holiday or birthday. She is nearly unbearable around Christmastime, walking around in holiday sweaters that embarrassed me growing up and even now. So, for the weeks leading up to their anniversary date, she was dropping hints and asking for my advice on a present for my father, all the time reminding me of the approaching day. I should be a bigger person. It’s one day out of the year. I could drop a card in the mail with some simple sentiment, nothing too sappy,&nbsp;devoid of anything&nbsp;that makes me sound overjoyed about the occasion. I could send flowers and just sign the card with my name. But I never have been able to make myself do it. My parents both grew up in poverty in an area of Kentucky that is still a bit lost in time. At that time, in that place, it wasn’t uncommon for people to marry young. My mother was sixteen when they married, my father was twenty. From day one, and not just because of her age, my mother has been dependent on my father. She is and has always been painfully shy, and doubts everything about herself with such depth that I am shocked when she steps even a millimeter outside of her comfort zone. She didn’t have a driver’s license until the age of 29, and this was after years of marriage and success&nbsp;with my father’s career—and after having two children. They had money for her to have a car. Instead, she waited for my father to take her where she needed to go. Their marriage showed no evidence of love or respect at any moment since I can remember-- since I knew even a little about what those words meant. My mother has always professed her love for my father. I know she believes that and means it. But how you can truly love someone who has never put you first, has never encouraged you or believed in you, who has belittled you, taken you for granted, ignored your birthdays, squashed your dreams, and expected in turn to be waited on hand and foot—is beyond comprehension for me. She was a child when she married him. He taught her his version of love and she was an excellent student. Fifty years of marriage for my parents, to me, is not a cause for celebration or special recognition. If I have to label it, I would say it is an accomplishment at best. My mother survived fifty years of never making a decision without deferring to my father. She managed to put a face on for the world that seemed together and content, when my father’s alcoholism and many affairs were the crippling reality. I can’t paint her completely as a hero or even a martyr-- as she lived in such denial over the toll my father’s choices and behavior were taking on our family. She chose indifference over action. She chose denial over protecting me. For the forty years I have lived with or known my parents, their marriage has confused me, saddened me, angered me. When I was very young, caught up in my mother’s excitement of marking special days on the calendar, I would make homemade cards for their anniversaries out of construction paper and glitter—happily handing it to them on the morning of the big day. But even when I was barely out of grade school, celebrating that day felt false. Not marking that day with some gesture wasn’t done out of bitterness, it just seemed so much like a lie, a betrayal of everything I knew to be true. I couldn’t make myself encourage my mother’s state of denial. I feel for her. I hurt for her. I wonder so often what my mother could have become, what she would have done with her life had she not married my father—or had she broken away from him when she was young. I sometimes imagine her with someone who would have seen her. Truly seen the person she is, the heart she has. She can’t even see it herself. So, each year, I let that day in February quietly pass. The square box stares back at me on the calendar. I don’t have to mark it, I know the date. It is the date that made my mother who she is, and me who I am. It was the beginning and the end for all of us. It is the loss of her innocence, the beginning of his betrayals. It is a mix of love and hate. It is a contradiction—wishing the union didn’t happen—but knowing I would not be here if it hadn’t. And there isn’t a card for that.
by: W.B. Yeats Went out to the hazel wood, Because a fire was in my head, And cut and peeled a hazel wand, And hooked a berry to a thread; And when white moths were on the wing, And moth-like stars were flickering out, I dropped the berry in a stream And caught a little silver trout. When I had laid it on the floor I went to blow the fire a-flame, But something rustled on the floor, And some one called me by my name: It had become a glimmering girl With apple blossom in her hair Who called me by my name and ran And faded through the brightening air. Though I am old with wandering Through hollow lands and hilly lands, I will find out where she has gone, And kiss her lips and take her hands; And walk among long dappled grass, And pluck till time and times are done The silver apples of the moon, The golden apples of the sun. please note: art by Kelly Fearing nothing to add... Small Breaths by Eileen Carney Hulme No matter that my heart sinks, sighs, with the weight of skeletons- paths I forgot to follow have slowly sealed rooms go unrecognised for fear of change and I cry at the uncertainty of rainbows. All the daydreams I stole, refusing to give them back are stored as silver dust and each day is a small breath. Another rainy day in CinCity, and if you are tired of reading this I am equally as tired of writing it. I'd like to say it's a warm spring rain, but it's not. Cold and rainy. CollegeGrrrrl is back in her CollegeTown, missing us after a week up at the lake with her stepdad and a day and a half with all the family together. HoneyHaired Grrrl leaves next week with a group from school for Greece. We need to go shopping for her, but it's a bit hard to get a feel for what their weather will be like. The riots going on there do nothing to motivate TryingVeryHardNotToBeWorried Mom, and think we won't be finding anything in Kevlar at The Gap. Hubby's at work, also missing the lake and being with us, but aside from sitting in the ER and faking a seizure, I don't think I can fix that. --- if you are prone to be offended by inappropriately hilarious hospital humor, please don't watch this. I believe we shall pull on our boots and grab an umbrella to go up to the local movie theater to see Ghost Writer. Seems like a damp and British, clandestine type of day. And of course, an afternoon full of English accents is spot on. Seriously. :>) what makes us laugh tonight... by Jane Hirshfield You must try, the voice said, to become colder. I understood at once. It's like the bodies of gods: cast in bronze, braced in stone. Only something heartless could bear the full weight. In Blackwater Woods by Mary Oliver Look, the trees are turning their own bodies into pillars of light, are giving off the rich fragrance of cinnamon and fulfillment, the long tapers of cattails are bursting and floating away over the blue shoulders of the ponds, and every pond, no matter what its name is, is nameless now. Every year everything I have ever learned in my lifetime leads back to this: the fires and the black river of loss whose other side is salvation, whose meaning none of us will ever know. To live in this world you must be able to do three things: to love what is mortal; to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it; and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.
Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital. - Aaron Levenstein The NSF has finally ended the suspense....I got the fellowship!!!! Woo hoo!!!! Ok, now I will take my immature celebratory whooping offline....but yay!!! So, the NSF's GRFP page has a notice that the site will be " unavailable Sunday, April 5 from 5:00PM ET until 12:00AM ET on Monday, April 6 for scheduled maintenance." Maybe this could this be an indicator that they're uploading the awardee information. Or am I just being hypervigilant? Last year the winners of the grant were posted on the 1st, so I have been in a state of constant anxiety waiting for the announcement this year. I should have taken it for granted (no pun intended, I promise) that the year I apply will be the one in which everything is delayed . . . but maybe the maintenance message is a cryptic light at the end of the tunnel? We shall see tomorrow. . . I am putting together the PowerPoint version of my honors thesis to present at our undergrad research forum next week, and so am scrounging Google images for maned wolf pictures. They have miserable reproductive success in captivity (details in the thesis!), so there aren't too many pictures of pups, but this one absolutely melted my heart and I have to share: Poor kid looks like he already knows his species is on the brink. And look at that little tail! Bless his heart . . .but I think the next one wins the prize . . . who knew your offspring's ears make good toothbrushes? And some human raised pups: And one last one, now we know how their legs get so long, baby yoga: (Image 1 credit , Image 2 credit , Image 3 credit , Image 4 credit ) The graduate school search has been inching along over the past few months. I applied to about five schools, visited three, and am now down to deciding between my top two choices. As with everything else in the country these days, finances and funding issues are unfairly large factors as well. I applied for the NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship grant back in November, and after months and months of patient waiting, notification season is upon us. Awardees are supposed to be receiving their letters over the next week or so. I have been putting the little red flag up on my mailbox every day, even though I have no outgoing mail, just so I can tell at a glance when the mail has been delivered. But even when I see the mail has been delivered, I wait all afternoon and make myself complete the day's list of work and writing goals before actually checking it, just in case the letter has come, because I know that once I recieve the news, for better or for worse, I'll be too worked up to accomplish anything for the rest of the day. At this point I'm not even really having anxiety over the fellowship itself, the main concern is that this award pretty much determines which school I'll be attending in the fall. I would like to know, already! But I am stuck in neutral as far as decision-making until I get word on the GRF. So, that is the current status on my quest to become a graduate student. I have found a really great job for the summer, but am holding off on blogging about it until it is 100% certain, still waiting for all the paperwork to go through. Pondering Pikaia has been neglected recently, I intend to be a better updater in the near future. In case you missed the announcement earlier this year, science news and research blogging has moved to Endless Forms over at the Nature Network, and PP is going to be more of a chronicle of my (hopefully) continuing progress through the world of academia. Meanwhile, is anyone else awaiting notification about the GRF? Any stories about the experience from people who have applied in the past? So, yesterday Bora and I had fun joking about what Charles Darwin would have been like on Twitter. We came up with some hypothetical yet reasonable ideas: Me: @arwallace Damn! and Bora: @rowen next time I'll block you! Today I thought of a couple more: @agassiz i can has barnacles? @huxley down, boy @drgully i'd like to see you try the wet wrap for a change!- So, in honor of Darwin Day on Thursday, I thought it would be fun to solicit more ideas, make up your own Darwin tweets and post them in the comments! Remember Tweets must be 140 characters or less. (Note: Someone has actually created Twitter accounts for both Darwin and Wallace, but they haven't been too active as of yet, and I trust the creativity/absurdity of Pondering Pikaia readers to get the creative juices flowing!). EDIT: it has come to my attention that there are two accounts for Darwin, the one I originally found was charles_darwin, but cdarwin is a good one, active and informative too! -Dr. Gully was the physician at Malvern, a medical resort where Darwin frequently sought treatment for his various infirmities and ailments. The treatments were decidedly unconventional, involving exposure to cold showers, being wrapped in cold wet sheets, etc etc. I thought that last year's ScienceOnline conference was great, but this year has had even more sessions, more people, and more fascinating topics. (I got a huge kick out of Henry Gee's summary in poetry form ). I missed the evening banquet tonight because of a slight emergency back home that I needed to handle, but the day was jam-packed with tons of blog goodness. I haven't been liveblogging, but I do have a review of the talks I attended today: First up: Blog-To-Book , moderated by Dave Munger and Tom Levenson . Dave and Tom told us about the role that blogging has played in their experiences with writing print books, and we discussed various issues involved in writing for books vs blogs. Some of the items mentioned were adjusting for a different audience, changing the structure from reporting to truly telling a structured story, and some discussion of why some bloggers want to try writing books. Is it because we feel our writing isn't truly legitimized by blogging, is it for fame and fortune, was it the writing goal even pre-blog? Does blogging help a writer to narrow down their interests for the book, or is it a diversion of time and effort? Someone (can't remember who, sorry!) drew the analogy that a blog entry is to a book what a YouTube video is to a feature film. Overall a very interesting discussion. Next: Transitions: Changing Your Online Persona as Your Real Life Changes , moderated by ScienceWoman and PropterDoc . I was very interested in this one, as I am approaching graduate school and contemplating how the transition between schools, advisors, and projects will affect my blogging. There was lots of good discussion about pros and cons to being anonymous, how to maintain an online presence without detriment to family/career, and other related topics. Some issues of the difference between the experience of men vs women were given a lot of time, as were the generational overhaul that seems to be slowly coming around, as newer professors can seem to be more comfortable with the idea of blogging than older advisors. My last session of the morning was Teaching College Science: Blogs and Beyond , moderated by Andrea Novicki and Brian Switek . I am currently a UTA for freshman Honors Organismal Biology, and hope to attain a faculty position some day, so I made sure to attend this one. There were many ideas presented on the advantages and challenges to using blogs in college classrooms. They can be great ways to engage reluctant learners or students who are more comfortable expressing themselves in writing than speaking up in class. Also, it's a great way to present supplemental material and encourage students to delve into the subject matter further in a less regimented, more exploratory way. It could become unwieldy for large classes, though, and there are also privacy issues. Overall, however, the ideas for innovative strategies and beneficial results were very encouraging. After lunch came the session in which I was a panelist: Blogging Adventure: How to Post from Strange Locations . The other panelists were Kevin Zelnio , Rick MacPherson , Meredith Barrett , Talia Page , Karen James , and Vanessa Woods . We started off with an interactive simulation of blogging in the field, complete with flashing lights, pinching bugs, and pen-stealing anglerfish. If the whole blogging thing falls through, we should set up an amusement park. Then we all shared our stories of blogging from the field, and talked about technical challenges, time constraints, and other obstacles to updating from remote areas. We also talked about why blogging from the field is important: it helps to maintain a connection to the outside world and update family and friends, gets people interested in science, and provides a social context for scientific research. I currently have a proposal under review for my master's thesis, but if it comes through I will have a brand new adventure blogging opportunity in the coming year...stay tuned! Finally, I attended How to Become a Paid Science Journalist: Advice for Bloggers , moderated by Tom Levenson and Rebecca Skloot . This included lots of great advice on how to pitch ideas to magazines, the importance of remaining aware that editors will judge your writing from any and all of your blog posts, etc. So, that was my day! Keep in mind that there are four concurrent session in each time slot at this conference, so there is much more going on than one person can relate! Keep an eye on Bora's blog aggregations of the conference updates of writers from all across the science blogosphere. I have had a great time, but tomorrow I am fleeing these arctic temperatures and heading back to Alabama. I've had a great time meeting and trading ideas with so many people this weekend, and I'm already looking forward to the 2010 conference! This morning I rode the arctic blast northwards, and I am here in Raleigh. I took a look around NC State earlier today (I am currently on the hunt for grad schools), but my main purpose for being here is the ScienceOnline 2009 blog conference! I had a fantastic time last year, and am looking forward to even more interesting sessions and people this time around. I will be on the panel for the Blogging Adventure: How to Post from Strange Locations session tomorrow (Saturday) at 4:30, where we will discuss issues involved in blogging from remote locations while doing field research. If anyone else on NN (or any other science blog network!) is in town for the conference, keep an eye out for me! (Cross-posted to EF )
intensifying and showcasing the metamorphosed earth. Moss covers live oaks like a coat of paint, contrasting with the wet, velvet black bark. Rainbows shimmer in the humid air. Gray glows argent, like burnished silver jewelry. Neighborhood cats, thick coats sprinkled with fairy dust, perfect muddy footprints trailing up and over my white car. A bird flutes a surprised, subdued query to unaccustomed early morning rain.Grackle flurries restlessly prowl in the twilight, one eye on the dumpsters outside the eateries close to the river, one leg on trees perilously bending under the weight of tens of thousands of the buggers, moving like black schools of fish, pulled apart and collapsing together again like taffy, yet somehow&nbsp; averting mid-air collisions and managing not to knock a neighbor off a perch.New buildings loom over downtown like giant, shiny tinker-toys. Or maybe metallic mushrooms. The currently tallest one looks suspiciously like a flash drive standing on end. Folks coming to SX won't believe how the skyline has changed in just one year. There's something vaguely nauseating about how much building is going on, when news from other towns describes a completely different story. Where is all the money coming from? Who will populate the buildings? Will they fill as quickly as they went up? Will it be a repeat of the 80's, when the original "skyscrapers" went up, only to stand empty and forlorn for who knows how long?Changes abound. Weddings and births
Welcome to moving day at Nurse Ratched’s Place. Yep, I’m out of here and I’m moving to my own website. The great thing about moving to a new website is that you don’t have to pack, rent a truck, or pick up a heavy box and throw your back out. However, you do have to find someone who can do some heavy lifting (I'm clueless about computer stuff), and help you get to your new destination. My moving man is the one and only Shane from Healthcare Today and Ask Shane.org. He’s not one of the guys wearing overalls in the picture. He’s my blog angel. Thank you, Shane. Please reset your links to my new web address, and come on over and see my new place. Check out NurseRatchedsPlace.com. I won’t ask you to carry boxes, and housewarming gifts are not required. I went to court yesterday to confront Mr. Jailbird, the man who attacked my coworkers and me a few months back. He looked “thrilled” to be in court. He cut his hair, cleaned himself up, and was accompanied to court by his social worker and his therapeutic foster parents. He’s an adult who is still in the foster care system. Go figure. His posse glared at me and the other nurses like we were deviants for making Mr. Jailbird talk to a judge about his criminal behavior. I stared back at them. Let the games begin. My coworkers and I sat through many mini hearings in the courtroom before they got to our case. We were the last ones on the court docket. Our assailant didn’t enter the courtroom until the last minute. He was waiting in the public defender's office. Right before our case was called, the court bailiff whispered something in the judge’s ear. Then the judge called a brief recess. There was a commotion at the bench as the judge was ushered to his chambers by security. The states attorney told us that Mr. Jailbird’s public defender had just warned the court of her clients escalating behavior. He was making threats against the judge and the witnesses in his case. The state’s attorney was smiling. Mr. Jailbird had just proven her case. Extra security officers quickly entered the courtroom. Then the judge came back into the courtroom and he started the trial. I testified first. Mr. Jailbird was about ten feet away from me as I recalled the events to the best of my ability. I could hear his chair creaking as he rocked in his seat. I glanced over once at Mr. Jailbird. His eyes locked on me. I fought back tears when the state’s attorney showed me the evidence bag containing the shank Mr. Jailbird used in the assault. I took a deep breath and focused on the judge. Then the public defender asked me questions. She tried to rattle me, but I took my time answering her questions. She knew her case was a lost cause because she was the one who had tipped off the court about her client’s threats. In the end, Mr. Jailbird was found guilty of 2nd degree assault and malicious destruction of property. The sentencing phase of the trial will take place in 90 days. The judge wants a court physiatrist to examine Mr. Jailbird before he decides what to do with him. In the meantime, Mr. Jailbird is going back home with his foster parents. The judge put him on a short leash. Mr. Jailbird was told that he would go to the poky if he acts up while he awaits his sentence. The judge also asked me when I wanted to make my victim statement. He said, “Do you want to do it now or later, although I can just imagine what you’re going to say. -Snort- " I’ll make my statement when the judge rules in the case. I bumped into Mr. Jailbird’s social worker as I was leaving court. She told me that no one currently involved in his case knew anything about Mr. Jailbird’s past exploits at the hospital. She showed me a legal pad filled with notes, and she told me that she was going to be making a lot of phone calls when she got home from court. Then I saw Mr. Jailbird's foster parents in the parking lot. They looked shell shocked. Mr. Jailbird faces ten years in jail and $25,000 fine. I just have one more thing to say: Throw em’ in jail! Jail Bird by Kevin Hanna I love this picture. Kevin Hanna is a very talented artists and I really like her work. Her creations are colorful, playful, and very imaginative. I hope to create another jailbird at the end of the week. I’m going to court on August 7th to testify against my attacker. He came after my coworkers and me a few months ago and tried stabbing us with a shank. It’s a toss up whether I’ll have my day in court. The court date has already been postponed twice. I’ll keep you posted. There’s something sinister going on in the universe. It’s a growing power that we can’t see or touch, but special people know that it’s there. This information is top secret, so don’t tell anyone else. My source works with the Ophra Team. Ophra Winfrey has been called the most powerful woman in America. Actually, she is the ruler of a secret society, which makes her the most powerful woman in the world. I’ve never met Ophra, but, as a psychiatric nurse, I do meet with members of her secret society on a regular basis. A member of Ophra’s secret society recently arrived on my unit. She spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, and she told me many insider secrets about Ophra’s secret society, and about Ophra Winfrey herself. Did you know that Ophra has a special team that implants microchips inside of her followers while they sleep? These implants foster the sense of brotherhood, making strangers into friends. Ophra has many friends. This is a common story among Ophra secret society members, so it must be true. My source also gave me the inside story about Stedman and Ophra’s friend, Gayle. Stedman is a robot, and Gayle and Ophra are lovers. I was shocked to learn about Stedman, but rumors have been flying around about Ophra’s gay relationship with Gayle for a long time. It’s an open secret…. not that there’s anything wrong with that. You may think that these wild stories are just conspiracy theories thought up by people who need to keep taking their medication. It’s true that people suffering from delusions can come up with some wacky tales. I’m sure that it’s just a coincidence that Ophra’s new XM Satellite Radio program is called, “Oprah & Friends,” and that she’s promoting a book called, The Secret . Watch your back. Ophra wants to be your friend, too. I just celebrated my 29th birthday. I’ve celebrated my 29th birthday for 24 consecutive year, so I have it down to a fine art. In honor of my special day, my two liberal daughters sent me birthday greetings, and birthday gifts via the Obama campaign. These are the pins that they sent me. I’m so proud of my daughters. They are special girls, and I always knew that they were destined to follow in my Democratic footsteps. I’ll never forget a report that I received from oldest daughter’s teacher during a parent-teacher conference back in 1989. That was the year that Mikhail Gorbachev, the former President of the Soviet Union, allowed the destruction of the Berlin Wall. My oldest daughter and I had watched the wall come down on TV, and I told her that we were witnessing a great day in world history. A couple of days later, my daughter’s teacher asked her class to name a famous person that they would like to meet. My daughter announced that she wanted to meet Mikhail Gorbachev because he was the great world leader who let people tear down the Berlin Wall. The teacher replied by asking my daughter if she would like to meet President Reagan. My daughter wrinkled up her nose and said, "Eewww, he's a Republican." God bless liberal children. Obama 08. This lady reminds me of my old school librarian. She taught my classmates and me about library etiquette. The number one rule involved silence. Silence was not only golden, it was a requirement if you didn’t want to get thrown out of the library. That’s not the case anymore. Today, the library is about as quiet as a Wal-Mart Superstore. Case in point. I’m currently sitting at my local library with small children running all around me while their mothers are talking on their stupid cell phones. Excuse me, but when did it become OK to jabber on a cell phone while your kids are running wild in public? And then there is the guy sitting directly behind me in a cubical. He is also running his mouth on a cell phone. Allow me to recap his conversation. (I wonder if he would stop using his cell phone in the library if he knew that he was the subject of today's post). First the guy calls his insurance agent and reports that his car was in an accident over the weekend. Apparently the guy’s lovely teenage daughter stole the keys to the car again , and went joyriding with her friends. I heard the guy tell his insurance agent that he hid the keys to the car in the mudroom, but that his little angel had snuck out of the house in the middle of the night after finding the car keys in an old shoe. Then I heard him say that everyone in the car was hurt and that his daughter is still in the hospital. She has broken bones and internal injuries. After a long pause, I heard him making excuses for his daughter’s irresponsible behavior. Poor baby. It's not her fault that she lied to her parents, and nearly killed herself along with her friends. I’m sure it won’t be long before his sweet angel makes her way onto my unit with a diagnosis of conduct disorder. Then I heard him call his business partner. He told his partner to write a check out to someone for half a million dollars. Then he told his partner not to sign the check before he sent it out in the mail. Sweet. Where are those mean looking librarians that use to tell noisy patrons to shut up. I'm going to buy this teeshirt. What do you think? Meet three eminent heart surgeons: Dr. Michael DeBakey (center), Dr. Christian Barnard (left), and Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz . These guys are medical pioneers. I wonder if they all hung out together on their time off. There is a brotherhood/sisterhood among cardiologists. They routinely save lives, and I think that experience draws them together into a tight community. My mom sent me this email about a cardiologist, a mechanic, and a car engine. Enjoy reading it, and have a nice weekend. A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of a Dodge SRT-4 when he spotted a well-known cardiologist in his shop, who was waiting for the service manager to take a look at his car. The mechanic shouted across the garage, 'Hey Doc, want to take a look at this?' The cardiologist, a bit surprised, walked over to where the mechanic was working on the SRT. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag, and asked, 'So, Doc, look at this engine. I open its heart, take the valves out, repair any damage, and then put them back in, and when I finish, it works just like new. So how come I make $39,675 a year, a pretty small salary, and you get the really big bucks, $1,695,759, when you and I are doing basically the same work?' The cardiologist paused, smiled, and leaned over, then whispered to the mechanic 'Try doing it with the engine running.' Our lovely nurse is gently holding her patient in her arms. Her navy blue cape is crisp, and her starched white uniform is spotless. It won't be spotless for long. Just wait until that smiling bundle of joy upchucks all over her white uniform. Too bad she isn’t wearing her scrubs. I bet our lovely nurse can’t wait for her young patient to go to sleep so she can start reading Change of Shift . It's posted over at Emeriblog .

In other news, Kaetlyn Wilcox has put her wonderful animal series up for sale on redbubble as cards and prints. Startling loveliness - check it out (by the way, redbubble has volume discounts if you buy more than four cards)!The talking flowers are cross-grained and dictatorial, they were in fact intended to satirize the flowers in Tennyson's poem "Maude" who were waiting longingly for an evocation of feminine grace, as opposed to the crazed red queen these flowers anticipate.
My girls are pretty self sufficient in the morning when it comes to making their own breakfast but usually it is just a bowl of cereal with some fruit, toast or some oatmeal.&#160; This works out great for me because I work every morning and when it’s busy I just don’t always want to stop to make them something to eat!&#160; On special days or days when I know they have worked their little bodies pretty hard the night before (BMX or Ice Skating) I will get up early and make them their favorite breakfast… It’s really nice and simple and they truly love it… Breakfast Sandwich (makes 2) &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ingredients: 4 slices of bacon, cut in half so they fit on the Sandwich Thin 2 eggs 2 slices of American cheese 2 Arnold’s Select Multigrain Sandwich Thins &#160; Directions: Place the bacon slices in your cast iron skillet (works best but you can use any skillet), cook until nice and crispy. Toast your sandwich thins once the bacon has cooked. Cook your eggs in the same skillet with the hot bacon grease.&#160; Salt and pepper the egg and gently break the yolk.&#160; Turn the egg to make it over easy and have the yolk mostly hard.&#160; Top with the slice of cheese and allow to melt slightly. Top one half of one of the toasted Sandwich Thins with 4 slices of the bacon (cut in half so they fit right?), then top with the cooked egg and melted cheese and the other Sandwich thin half. Repeat for second one. --They really like this with a cut up banana and some OJ. ---We have been known to have this for dinner as well…We love “Breakfast for Dinner Nights”! &#160; Okeeheelee State Qualifier Race Most of you know by now that my oldest daughter, Kyra races BMX .&#160; She has only been doing this since last May but is really loving it and doing really well.&#160; It’s a tough sport but she seems to just be thriving in the environment.&#160; She is a strong, smart and very tough little girl and we are incredibly proud! Anyway this past weekend we were at a Qualifier for the State races over at Okeeheelee BMX in West Palm, just over on the other coast.&#160; It was a 2 day race with some festivities starting on Friday.&#160; Seeing as I would really rather spend the night in my own bed then any other bed anywhere we decided that we would stay at home on Friday and get a real early start on Sat.&#160; Early start we did and we made it to the track with plenty of time for Kyra to get some practice laps in and then onto the races.&#160; The races on Sat. were great but the mains were delayed by over 2 hours by the coldest, ickiest, nastiest rain ever.&#160; We used the delay time to get checked into our hotel.&#160; Made it back and continued on racing into the night.&#160; On the first day Kyra placed 3rd, 2nd and 3rd in the semis.&#160; In her main she placed 7th.&#160; Not the finish she was hoping for but a great finish nonetheless… Sunday we woke up bright and early to do it all over again.&#160; Sunday though the weather was beautiful.&#160; Cool and sunny.&#160; Kyra placed 3rd in all her motos and 7th in her main.&#160; Perfect racing weather!!! Instead of buying food at the track for all the days there we had decided with our racing buddies to get together and pack up a meal, burgers, hot dogs, and salad. So now onto the food… Tomato Basil Salad (adapted from The Church Cook) This is the perfect salad for a picnic, pot luck or any time you need to make something ahead of time.&#160; The dressing can be made ahead and the salad all prepped just add the dressing and the parmesan about 5 minutes before serving and toss well… 2 chopped seeded plum tomatoes 1 cup (packed) coarsely chopped fresh basil 1/4 cup white wine vinegar 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 2 garlic cloves 1 teaspoon sugar 1 cup olive oil, extra-virgin Romaine lettuce, chopped Grape Tomatoes Red Peppers, sliced&#160; Red Onions, sliced thin Grated Parmesan or any other garnishes Blend first 7 ingredients and 1/2 cup oil in processor or blender. With machine running, add remaining 1/2 cup oil; process until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using. Toss the salad 5-10 minutes before serving. Had to improvise with the cheese for the burgers (used cheese sticks), but check it out…we even had bacon!!!&#160; Cindy was a pro with her marine grill!!! Great time had by all.&#160; Thanks Chris, Amy, Cindy and Scott for the great company!!!&#160; And the kids totally rocked… The February 2010 Daring Bakers’ challenge was hosted by Aparna of My Diverse Kitchen and Deeba of Passionate About Baking . They chose Tiramisu as the challenge for the month. Their challenge recipe is based on recipes from The Washington Post, Cordon Bleu at Home and Baking Obsession. It turned out perfect.&#160; The only thing I will do differently next time is to dip the cookies in the espresso mixture for longer.&#160; I was afraid of them becoming mushy! And what an incredible challenge this was!&#160; And not because I screwed anything up this time!&#160; They made us make this from complete 100% scratch.&#160; Right down to&#160; making our own mascarpone cheese.&#160; I had to read through the directions several times just to be sure they didn’t want us making our own vanilla and rum extracts!!! I truly loved this challenge and for me it was probably one of the most rewarding.&#160; If I had never done this challenge I would NEVER have made my own mascarpone cheese and it is something that is so delicious, simple and satisfying to do!&#160; Thank you my dear, sweet friend Deeba and Aparna for this wonderful challenge!!! Mascarpone cheese, zabaglione, pastry cream, and Ladyfinger/Saviardi Biscuits Due to time restrictions for me (we are leaving town today for a BMX Race) I only made a small one in a bread pan, but it was truly delicious… The recipes for this challenge are presented in the following order: A. Tiramisu (includes zabaglione &amp; vanilla pastry cream) B. Mascarpone Cheese C. Ladyfinger/ Savoiardi Biscuits MANDATORY: You MUST make your own savoiardi / ladyfinger biscuits and mascarpone cheese with the given recipes. You must also make the zabaglione and pastry cream using the given recipes. If diet or health restrictions do not allow you to use these recipes, please go ahead and use one of the alternatives provided or other suitable recipes to make them, but please include links to the original recipe in your DB post. Sponge cake may be not be used as a substitute . After all, a large part of this challenge is making those biscuits. VARIATIONS: Tiramisu is usually made in square dishes and cut into squares to serve. If you want to be different, please feel free to give full rein to your creativity as to how you want to present, decorate and serve your tiramisu. Make it square, round, as individual servings, or whatever! However, your version of Tiramisu must contain the mascarpone cheese and the savoiardi/ ladyfinger biscuits you made. PREPARATION TIME: Tiramisu is made up of several components which can be made separately and ahead of time and put together the day before serving. Making tiramisu from scratch requires about 2 to 3 days (including refrigeration) from when you start making the mascarpone to the time the tiramisu is served. So this challenge requires some prior planning. Please read the instructions as you need to begin making the mascarpone at least a day in advance. The zabaglione &amp; pastry cream also need 4 hours to an overnight for chilling, as does the main dessert. The flavours mature after an overnight rest, and the dessert can be kept refrigerated for 2-3 days. Once assembled, the tiramisu can be frozen till you need to serve it, in case you are not serving it immediately. EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: A double boiler (a stainless steel bowl that fits inside a large saucepan/ pot without touching the bottom will do) Two or three large mixing bowls Whisk A medium sized heavy bottomed pan Fine meshed strainer (to remove lumps from pastry cream, if any) Electric mixer, hand held Serving dish (or dishes) of choice (8&quot; by 8&quot; should be fine) Spatula for folding and spoons as required Plastic wrap/ clingfilm Baking sheets Parchment paper or nonstick liners Pastry bag (can be disposable) Plain 3/4&quot; pastry bag tip or cut the end of pastry bag to this size (If you don’t have a pastry bag and/or tips, you can use a Ziploc bag with the corner snipped off) Oven Cooling rack Thin-bladed spatula for removing ladyfinger biscuits from the baking sheets Instant-read thermometer (optional) Strainer Cheesecloth or cotton napkin for draining mascarpone Fine-mesh strainer for shaking cocoa powder on tiramisu TIRAMISU (Recipe source: Carminantonio's Tiramisu from The Washington Post, July 11 2007 ) This recipe makes 6 servings Ingredients: For the zabaglione: 2 large egg yolks 3 tablespoons sugar/50gms 1/4 cup/60ml Marsala wine (or port or coffee) 1/4 teaspoon/ 1.25ml vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest For the vanilla pastry cream: 1/4 cup/55gms sugar 1 tablespoon/8gms all purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1/2 teaspoon/ 2.5ml vanilla extract 1 large egg yolk 3/4 cup/175ml whole milk For the whipped cream: 1 cup/235ml chilled heavy cream (we used 25%) 1/4 cup/55gms sugar 1/2 teaspoon/ 2.5ml vanilla extract To assemble the tiramisu: 2 cups/470ml brewed espresso, warmed 1 teaspoon/5ml rum extract (optional) 1/2 cup/110gms sugar 1/3 cup/75gms mascarpone cheese 36 savoiardi/ ladyfinger biscuits (you may use less) 2 tablespoons/30gms unsweetened cocoa powder Method: For the zabaglione: Heat water in a double boiler. If you don’t have a double boiler, place a pot with about an inch of water in it on the stove. Place a heat-proof bowl in the pot making sure the bottom does not touch the water. In a large mixing bowl (or stainless steel mixing bowl), mix together the egg yolks, sugar, the Marsala (or espresso/ coffee), vanilla extract and lemon zest. Whisk together until the yolks are fully blended and the mixture looks smooth. Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler or place your bowl over the pan/ pot with simmering water. Cook the egg mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 8 minutes or until it resembles thick custard. It may bubble a bit as it reaches that consistency. Let cool to room temperature and transfer the zabaglione to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, until thoroughly chilled. For the pastry cream: Mix together the sugar, flour, lemon zest and vanilla extract in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. To this add the egg yolk and half the milk. Whisk until smooth. Now place the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from curdling. Add the remaining milk a little at a time, still stirring constantly. After about 12 minutes the mixture will be thick, free of lumps and beginning to bubble. (If you have a few lumps, don’t worry. You can push the cream through a fine-mesh strainer.) Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl and cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic film and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight, until thoroughly chilled. For the whipped cream: Combine the cream, sugar and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer or immersion blender until the mixture holds stiff peaks. Set aside. To assemble the tiramisu: Have ready a rectangular serving dish (about 8&quot; by 8&quot; should do) or one of your choice. Mix together the warm espresso, rum extract and sugar in a shallow dish, whisking to mix well. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, beat the mascarpone cheese with a spoon to break down the lumps and make it smooth. This will make it easier to fold. Add the prepared and chilled zabaglione and pastry cream, blending until just combined. Gently fold in the whipped cream. Set this cream mixture aside. Now to start assembling the tiramisu. Workings quickly, dip 12 of the ladyfingers in the sweetened espresso, about 1 second per side. They should be moist but not soggy. Immediately transfer each ladyfinger to the platter, placing them side by side in a single row. You may break a lady finger into two, if necessary, to ensure the base of your dish is completely covered. (I should have soaked mine longer!!!) Spoon one-third of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers, then use a rubber spatula or spreading knife to cover the top evenly, all the way to the edges. Repeat to create 2 more layers, using 12 ladyfingers and the cream mixture for each layer. Clean any spilled cream mixture; cover carefully with plastic wrap and refrigerate the tiramisu overnight. To serve, carefully remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh strainer or decorate as you please. Cut into individual portions and serve. MASCARPONE CHEESE (Source: Vera’s Recipe for Homemade Mascarpone Cheese ) This recipe makes 12oz/ 340gm of mascarpone cheese Ingredients: 474ml (approx. 500ml)/ 2 cups whipping (36 %) pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized), preferably organic cream (between 25% to 36% cream will do) 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice Method: Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a wide skillet. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the water is barely simmering. Pour the cream into a medium heat-resistant bowl, then place the bowl into the skillet. Heat the cream, stirring often, to 190 F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until small bubbles keep trying to push up to the surface. It will take about 15 minutes of delicate heating. Add the lemon juice and continue heating the mixture, stirring gently, until the cream curdles. Do not expect the same action as you see during ricotta cheese making. All that the whipping cream will do is become thicker, like a well-done crème anglaise. It will cover a back of your wooden spoon thickly. You will see just a few clear whey streaks when you stir. Remove the bowl from the water and let cool for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, line a sieve with four layers of dampened cheesecloth and set it over a bowl. Transfer the mixture into the lined sieve. Do not squeeze the cheese in the cheesecloth or press on its surface (be patient, it will firm up after refrigeration time). Once cooled completely, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate (in the sieve) overnight or up to 24 hours. Vera’s notes: The first time I made mascarpone I had all doubts if it’d been cooked enough, because of its custard-like texture. Have no fear, it will firm up beautifully in the fridge, and will yet remain lusciously creamy. Keep refrigerated and use within 3 to 4 days. LADYFINGERS/ SAVOIARDI BISCUITS (Source: Recipe from Cordon Bleu At Home ) This recipe makes approximately 24 big ladyfingers or 45 small (2 1/2&quot; to 3&quot; long) ladyfingers. Ingredients: 3 eggs, separated 6 tablespoons /75gms granulated sugar 3/4 cup/95gms cake flour, sifted (or 3/4 cup all purpose flour + 2 tbsp corn starch) 6 tablespoons /50gms confectioner's sugar, Method: Preheat your oven to 350 F (175 C) degrees, then lightly brush 2 baking sheets with oil or softened butter and line with parchment paper. Beat the egg whites using a hand held electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gradually add granulate sugar and continue beating until the egg whites become stiff again, glossy and smooth. In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks lightly with a fork and fold them into the meringue, using a wooden spoon. Sift the flour over this mixture and fold gently until just mixed. It is important to fold very gently and not overdo the folding. Otherwise the batter would deflate and lose volume resulting in ladyfingers which are flat and not spongy. Fit a pastry bag with a plain tip (or just snip the end off; you could also use a Ziploc bag) and fill with the batter. Pipe the batter into 5&quot; long and 3/4&quot; wide strips leaving about 1&quot; space in between the strips. Sprinkle half the confectioner's sugar over the ladyfingers and wait for 5 minutes. The sugar will pearl or look wet and glisten. Now sprinkle the remaining sugar. This helps to give the ladyfingers their characteristic crispness. Hold the parchment paper in place with your thumb and lift one side of the baking sheet and gently tap it on the work surface to remove excess sprink
ed sugar. Bake the ladyfingers for 10 minutes, then rotate the sheets and bake for another 5 minutes or so until the puff up, turn lightly golden brown and are still soft. Allow them to cool slightly on the sheets for about 5 minutes and then remove the ladyfingers from the baking sheet with a metal spatula while still hot, and cool on a rack. Store them in an airtight container till required. They should keep for 2 to 3 weeks. Thanks again Deeba and Aparna! I’m cold. Now I am not talking just a little cold here, I mean I am bundle up in a bunch of sweaters, fuzzy sock and big slippers, gallons of hot tea being drank, but I still can’t seem to get warm so I guess that’s why my family is eating lots of soups and comfort foods right now! Anything to try and be warm. This chili fit the bill. Needed to simmer on the stove and I knew if would smell just perfect and add the illusion of warmth to the house! Turned out absolutely perfect and I can’t wait for the leftover for dinner tonight! Recipe for the cornbread can be found here !

Add beans, tomatoes with juices, broth and chocolate. Bring chili to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered until chili thickens, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour but can be simmered longer for a thicker chili. Season with salt and pepper. What you didn’t know it was Pancake Day today?&#160; Funny isn’t it when you grow up with a tradition and then almost 30, ummmm, maybe more years later you realize that not everyone even knows what it is???&#160; That’s what happened to me this morning with Pancake Day.&#160; I was on twitter (follow me at www.twitter.com/nofearentertain ) and I mentioned that I was making pancakes for the girl’s for Pancake Day.&#160; That’s when I was forced to realize that not everyone celebrated the way we always had.&#160; Here is a good link to some history behind “Pancake Day” and all of the other traditions and names that&#160; this one day has!!!&#160; Shrove Tuesday 2010 (Pancake Day) I grew up in Canada and my Mom is from England so that explains why we call it Pancake Day!&#160; What do you call it??? Here is our favorite “Breakfast For Dinner” recipe that would be perfect for your dinner on Pancake Day! Apple Pancakes (adapted from Smitten Kitchen ) Ingredients: 2 eggs, well beaten 1 1/2 cups of milk 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tsp cinnamon 14 tsp nutmeg 3 medium apples, peeled and coarsely grated (I used macintosh and a honey crisp apple.&#160; You could use any) Directions: 1. Mix the eggs with the milk and vanilla extract in a large bowl. 2. In a smaller bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg together. 3. Combine the wet and the dry ingredients and stir in the apples. 4. Heat a thin layer of oil in an electric skillet on medium heat. Drop large spoonful of batter into the pan and flatten it out a little (otherwise, you might have trouble getting them to cook in the center) and cook until golden brown underneath. Flip the pancakes and cook them for an additional two or three minutes. I sprinkled these with cinnamon sugar and topped them with maple syrup but apple sauce will be great on them too! My sister turned me onto this cookbook. Tosca Reno's Eat Clean Cookbook: Delicious Recipes That Will Burn Fat and Re-Shape Your Body! Heard of it? Pretty incredible recipes. My sister has tried a whole bunch of them but me being the slacker that I am lately have only tried one. But it was good. Really, really good. To the point of being so good that when I told the girls that we were having it again for dinner tonight (slacker and eating up leftovers) they were pretty happy about it again!!! Perfect soup for the cold weather and totally healthy too… Of course I had to make some changes based on what I had available but I stayed true to the real recipe. It was fast and came together perfectly. I made it in the afternoon but left out the pasta and the spinach. When we got home later on I had the girls shower and get ready for bed while I finished it up. This was a perfect make ahead soup for me…I also figured out that it was 5 Weight Watcher points based on a 1 1/2 cup serving. Zesty Spinach Soup Tosca Reno's Eat Clean Cookbook: Delicious Recipes That Will Burn Fat and Re-Shape Your Body! Ingredients: 2 Tbsp best quality extra virgin olive oil 1 purple onion, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 thick carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 cup chopped celery, including leaves 3 cloves garlic, passed through a garlic press 1 tsp sea salt Pinch of fresh ground black pepper 6 cups of low sodium chicken or vegetable stock (I used 4 cups of stock and 2 cups of water) 2 vegetable or chicken vegetable bouillon cubes (I used 2 tsp of Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken) 2 cups chopped tomatoes (I used one can of diced and drained some of the juice out, tomato hater in the family) 1/2 cup of well rinsed quinoa (I used 1 cup of uncooked orzo pasta because I couldn’t find quinoa!) 2 cups of white kidney beans, well rinsed and drained 1 tsp curry powder pinch of ground nutmeg 3 cups of baby spinach leaves Directions: Heat oil over medium heat in a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Add onion and sauté over medium-low heat until translucent. Add carrots, celery, garlic and salt. Sauté until vegetables are golden, about 5 minutes. Add stock or water. Add bouillon cubes and add to liquid. Add tomatoes, quinoa, beans and spices. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender. Add the spinach and cover. Cook briefly, just until leaves are wilted. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot with crusty bread. And lucky me…I grew up eating these!!! The January 2010 Daring Bakers’ challenge was hosted by Lauren of Celiac Teen . Lauren chose Gluten-Free Graham Wafers and Nanaimo Bars as the challenge for the month. The sources she based her recipe on are 101 Cookbooks and www.nanaimo.ca . I almost missed making these.&#160; Something about them having to be posted on the 27th of the month just messes me up bad but with bold determination and severely lacking eyesight I forged ahead and got these done!!! I knew I had to make the graham crackers first.&#160; I had already decided that as interesting as it would be to do them gluten free I really didn’t have the time or the money to be hunting down ingredients I would only be using once so I cheated and made them with Whole Wheat Graham Flour and they really are delicious!!!&#160; I made these this morning and it went off without a hitch.&#160; Had them out of the oven and I was on my way to the eye doctor.&#160; Well. by the time I got home I couldn’t see a thing.&#160; He had tricked me a dilated my eyes.&#160; I was virtually blind, but the DB Challenge must go on!!!&#160; I cut the recipe and copied it and then made it REALLY , REALLY BIG so that I could at least make out the measures.&#160; The whole time I am kicking myself for leaving it til the very last minute…:-( Anyway…these turned out beautifully despite all of my self inflicted challenges and it brought back a lot of great childhood memories for me!!! &#160; These were taken after my eyes were dilated by the stupid eye doctor.&#160; I was lucky to find the camera!!! Graham Cracker Recipe (that I used) by Cupcake Project Ingredients: 4 T (1/2 stick) butter, softened 1 egg 6 T sugar 4 T honey (Some graham crackers use half honey and half molasses. You might consider trying that as a variation.) 1/2 t baking soda 2 t water 3/4 t salt 1 1/2 C graham flour (If you can't get a hold of graham flour, there are plenty of graham cracker recipes that use regular whole wheat flour such as this graham cracker recipe from Baking Bites . You may also be able to directly substitute whole wheat flour in this recipe, but I haven't tested it and I make no promises.) 3/4 C all-purpose flour Directions: Preheat the oven to 350 F. Combine the butter, egg and sugar in a bowl and beat until smooth and creamy. Stir in the honey and blend. Dissolve the baking soda in the water and add to the butter mixture. Add the salt, graham flour, and all-purpose flour to the mixture and blend thoroughly. The dough should hold together and be manageable. If it is too &quot;tacky&quot; add a little more graham flour. Liberally dust a surface with graham flour and roll the dough to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. For convenience in handling, cut the rolled dough into three or four sections that will fit on your cookie sheet. (I am not good at rolling things out. It doesn't come up too often since I mostly make cupcakes. To make my life easier, I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper and rolled the dough directly on the cookie sheets. That way I didn't need to worry about the dough breaking when I lifted it onto a cookie sheet.) With a knife, score the dough, without cutting through, into 2 1/2 inch squares. (Boring! Since your graham crackers are not store-bought, they don't have to be square. Use your cookie cutters to make them any shape you want!) Prick each square a few times with the tines of a fork. (I did this because those little pricks do make them look like graham crackers, whatever shape they are.) Using a spatula, place the sections of scored cracker dough on an ungreased cookie sheet. (I didn't have to do this since I rolled right on the cookie sheet.) Bake on the first side for 8 minutes, then turn the cracker over and bake for another 6 or 7 minutes. (Cheryl of Free Range Living said that she found that flipping wasn't necessary. I agree. I left out the flip step.) Remove from the oven and cool on racks. (They weren't quite crispy when I removed them. However, they hardened up as soon as they cooled.) Here how is the recipe as it should have been done for gluten free: For Gluten-Free Graham Wafers Ingredients 1 cup (138 g) (4.9 ounces) Sweet rice flour (also known as glutinous rice flour) 3/4 cup (100 g) (3.5 ounces) Tapioca Starch/Flour 1/2 cup (65 g) (2.3 ounces) Sorghum Flour 1 cup (200 g) (7.1 ounces) Dark Brown Sugar, Lightly packed 1 teaspoon (5 mL) Baking soda 3/4 teaspoon (4 mL ) Kosher Salt 7 tablespoons (100 g) (3 ½ ounces) Unsalted Butter (Cut into 1-inch cubes and frozen) 1/3 cup (80 mL) Honey, Mild-flavoured such as clover. 5 tablespoons (75 mL) Whole Milk 2 tablespoons (30 mL) Pure Vanilla Extract Directions: 1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, combine the flours, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. Pulse on low to incorporate. Add the butter and pulse on and off, until the mixture is the consistency of a coarse meal. If making by hand, combine aforementioned dry ingredients with a whisk, then cut in butter until you have a coarse meal. No chunks of butter should be visible. 2. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the honey, milk and vanilla. Add to the flour mixture until the dough barely comes together. It will be very soft and sticky. 3. Turn the dough onto a surface well-floured with sweet rice flour and pat the dough into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, about 2 hours, or overnight. 4. Divide the dough in half and return one half to the refrigerator. Sift an even layer of sweet rice flour onto the work surface and roll the dough into a long rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. The dough will be quite sticky, so flour as necessary. Cut into 4 by 4 inch squares. Gather the scraps together and set aside. Place wafers on one or two parchment-lined baking sheets. Chill until firm, about 30 to 45 minutes. Repeat with the second batch of dough. 5. Adjust the rack to the upper and lower positions and preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). 6. Gather the scraps together into a ball, chill until firm, and reroll. Dust the surface with more sweet rice flour and roll out the dough to get a couple more wafers. 7. Prick the wafers with toothpick or fork, not all the way through, in two or more rows. 8. Bake for 25 minutes, until browned and slightly firm to the touch, rotating sheets halfway through to ensure even baking. Might take less, and the starting location of each sheet may determine its required time. The ones that started on the bottom browned faster. 9. When cooled completely, place enough wafers in food processor to make 1 ¼ cups (300 mL) of crumbs. Another way to do this is to place in a large ziplock bag, force all air out and smash with a rolling pin until wafers are crumbs. Nanaimo Bars Ingredients: For Nanaimo Bars — Bottom Layer 1/2 cup (115 g) (4 ounces) Unsalted Butter 1/4 cup (50 g) (1.8 ounces) Granulated Sugar 5 tablespoons (75 mL) Unsweetened Cocoa 1 Large Egg, Beaten 1 1/4 cups (300 mL) (160 g) (5.6 ounces) Gluten Free Graham Wafer Crumbs (See previous recipe) 1/2 cup (55 g) (1.9 ounces) Almonds (Any type, Finely chopped) 1 cup (130 g) (4.5 ounces) Coconut (Shredded, sweetened or unsweetened) For Nanaimo Bars — Middle Layer 1/2 cup (115 g) (4 ounces) Unsalted Butter 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons (40 mL) Heavy Cream 2 tablespoons (30 mL) Vanilla Custard Powder (Such as Bird’s. Vanilla pudding mix may be substituted.) 2 cups (254 g) (8.9 ounces) Icing Sugar For Nanaimo Bars — Top Layer 4 ounces (115 g) Semi-sweet chocolate 2 tablespoons (28 g) (1 ounce) Unsalted Butter Directions: 1. For bottom Layer: Melt unsalted butter, sugar and cocoa in top of a double boiler. Add egg and stir to cook and thicken. Remove from heat. Stir in crumbs, nuts and coconut. Press firmly into an ungreased 8 by 8 inch pan. 2. For Middle Layer: Cream butter, cream, custard powder, and icing sugar together well. Beat until light in colour. Spread over bottom layer. 3. For Top Layer: Melt chocolate and unsalted butter over low heat. Cool. Once cool, pour over middle layer and chill. Okay, I really loved these and despite all of my self inflicted trouble with them I would make them again and again!&#160; Almost every family special occasion that we had we had the on the dessert table.&#160; Such a treat to be able to make these myself.&#160; Thanks Lauren for the opportunity and the reminder!
The Social Sciences began experimenting with visualization as early as the 1910s, when Franz Boas applied Kwakiutl place-names to an ordinary map to help him better explain the Kwakiutl world view. In the 1940s, scholars of folklore began abstracting these geographical diagrams into "synoptic diagrams" that showed concepts in relationship to each other. Since that time, scholars around a range of disciplines have used mental maps and synoptic diagrams for their powers at synthesizing a range of information from diverse fields. James A. Notopoulos, “The Symbolism of the Sun and Light in the Republic of Plato. II,” Classical Philology 39, no. 4 (October 1944): 223-240. Briefly, visualizations do two things to rational argument that text is very bad at doing. Synoptic diagrams are excellent at getting people on the same page. For this reason, anthropologists in the 1960s used them to synthesize everything known about cultural binaries, making sure that divergent scholars came to a consensus about the shape of world view. For this reason, too, "visual journalists" were hired in Silicon Valley from the 1970s forward to draw synoptic diagrams of a discussion, live. When everything everyone has said in a meeting appears on the wall, visually organized by the proximity of arguments, the meeting tends towards agreement. With a visual record, it's more difficult to suddenly disagree, reposition oneself from the outside or challenge the record. Visual diagrams lend permanence to thoughts and help to establish universal, structural arrangements, organizing all intellectual manifestations. Visual diagrams are also particularly useful for ability to pan out. In a text document, it's often hard to get an overview without relying on an arbitrary abstraction like a table of contents. When reading a map, however, the scholar bends over to see more clearly the detail around a particular city, or steps back to see the nation as a whole. Just so, a visual diagram of an argument allows the reader to very quickly slip between the finite details and the big picture -- making sure that the argument fits exactly where it's supposed to. For both of these reasons, I've found, as a scholar who produces text, that visual diagramming aids both my ability to recall large numbers of facts -- and to organize them into a larger picture without repeating myself. There's much to be said here, but I'll confine myself to mentioning two of my favorite tools and their uses. 1) PersonalBrain Key uses: - Notetaking at conferences/lectures when facts may be needed for later recall - Organizing facts related to an overview of a broader field - Brainstorming in a relatively new subject area - Keeping track of large numbers of dates, characters, and places when these items are new PersonalBrain is a sovereign organizer of images, notes, and web links -- it allows you to drag and drop URL's, jpg's, and text from your daily reading program into a map. A few keystrokes allow you to type "thoughts," quickly linking "up" to "parent thoughts" -- overarching categories (History of Chicago &lt; History of Cities) -- and "down" to "child thoughts" (History of Chicago &gt; Ship and Sanitary Canal ). PersonalBrain is amazing at making million-thought outlines at conferences. Using it to take notes allows you to, over time, create an extended map of your entire knowledge of things-people-have-told-you-about-the-periphery-of-your-field. Say I'm listening to presentations at the Anglo-American Conference, and one of them includes a colleague lecturing on balloon housing in the history of Chicago. When I begin taking notes on "Balloon Housing," I link it to the "History of Chicago." PersonalBrain remembers that I have other notes on the History of Chicago, and suddenly, my two sets of ideas are connected. Everything the colleague now tells me about housing and construction is now linked, however distantly, to the larger thoughts, The History of Chicago and the History of Cities. Should I ever need to locate those thoughts again, there they are, linked up with their related subjects. Over time, these expanding larger categories ("history", "modernity", and "landscape" are key ones in my case) come to be enriched with detailed information garnered from sitting in conferences, job talks, and other lectures. Five years from now, when I'm suddenly called upon to teach an introduction to Western Civilization, there will be my lecture notes: matching my colleague, his references to Chicago, all the notes I took, and any other notes I happen to take on Chicago after now. Say I'm planning that lecture, and want to recall how Chicago fits into everything else I know about modernity. PersonalBrain allows me to pan back from the single-thought view. It creates a map -- weighting thoughts related to each other so that they float near each other. On a big screen, entire branches of knowledge become clear. This flexibility and permanence become rapidly useful when you're juggling large numbers of concepts whose relationship to each other is still unclear to you. A perfect example: rewriting a syllabus. I recently sat down to reconsider the syllabus for a graduate course in Digital History, which I teach at the University of Chicago in Winter 2010-11. The course I teach has three parts -- one, a history of information revolutions since Gutenberg (with readings by Bob Darnton, Adrian Johns, and Ray Kurzweil). Two, an overview of contemporary issues like privacy and copyright (readings by Larry Lessig and Dan Cohen). Three, an introduction to new methods like GIS, network analysis, and collaborative writing. That's a lot of information to teach. The class only goes clearly if one divides up the syllabus nicely into classes where each meeting offers a small dose of each subject. How to make sure I'm covering my bases? Brainstorming with PersonalBrain helped: I outlined issues and grouped texts together before creating time-oriented thoughts like "Week 1" and dividing them. Take it for a whirl: Digital History Syllabus (Hint: the "+" in the menu expands to a more elaborate view; the spider-icon allows you to switch from normal view to expanded view where you start to see the big picture.) Personal Brain's one weakness for my purposes is that it's not designed to allow you to write in paragraphs. Your "idea" is only allowed to be about 40 or so characters long. The program is therefore not ideal for writing essays. Thus, the thousand notes on railways i took at the Huntington Library last year: not so great. They're a beautiful outline. They're wonderful to lecture from. I can rearrange them, elaborate them in the "notes" view, and then export them as a text outline. It's very difficult, however, to work sentence-by-sentence through my notes, to make sure that every thought goes in an explanatory order, and that conclusions follow after facts. Since that visit to the Huntington, I've figured out that a better piece of software for outlining notes that go into essays is MindManager, a mind-mapping program designed to fit seamlessly into Word. 2) MindManager Key uses: - taking notes on a historiography - taking notes for an essay while moving towards the ultimate structure of the essay Mindmanager allows you to take notes on a project and move them around in a 3d map until they make sense. Because the essay view is synoptic, the writer's eye can constantly move back up the tree hierarchy -- to make sure that this thought is in the right place -- and down the tree hierarchy -- to make sure that every statement is thoroughly supported with adequate evidence. The essay is written as a branching tree. Each sentence and paragraph can be dragged-and-dropped into place; entire sections can be rearranged, with their entire structure intact, into the linear flow of the essay. In this way, the essay's structure is constantly being reorganized for clearer flow. The writer has the ability to easily zoom in and out of a particular view. As one zooms out, viewing the entire essay as a map, blank spaces of insufficient support become visually clear. That ability alone decreases the chances of convincing oneself that one has adequately supported a point only to remember, when printing the essay out, that insufficient evidence has been cited. Such tools increase the writer's chances of catching redundancies early, and decrease the likelihood of writing and rewriting the same essay over and over again. A few weeks' work suggests that Mindmanager doubles the writing speed of an average essay, at least. Once the thoughts are organized in what seems to be their proper shape, sufficiently elaborated, the writer exports to a text document. The visual, hierarchical mindmap instantly becomes a linear essay. However: MindManager doesn't allow you to make the million-point 3d map of your own brain. It's marvelous for moving from a visual brainstorming diagram of main points down to support; it's less good at creating permanent ideas in a branching tree of knowledge, giving large ideas permanence, and making connections where none previously existed. For brilliant note-taking at conferences where people are throwing you information you might need to find again in 5 years -- much better to use Personal Brain. For my own purposes, I've chosen to adopt both tools for different uses. I use PersonalBrain for taking notes in other people's lectures -- for organizing my knowledge of things of general interest -- and mindmanager for taking notes specific to your own project -- for turning note cards into essays. Credit where credit is due: Thanks to Jerry Michalski and Cathrine Dam for plugging me in! The depression didn't start on Wall Street; it started in Flint, Michigan several decades ago. Thirty years ago, city elders in the Rust Belt announced their plan to rescue economic elites from the sinking ship of car manufacture. Ominously dubbed "Shrinking Cities," the plan evicted tax-delinquent working-class people from their homes and resold the remaining houses on double-wide lots..., (my article continues at the Huffington Post: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jo-guldi/the-anti-development-cris_b_392743.html ) What are we to think about industrial decay? Should cities like post-Katrina New Orleans or Flint, be cut off, left to drown in their own economic failures? It is not a new question. In the 1890s, the Gold Rush of '49 was old news; new types of mining opened industrial sites elsewhere and the boomtowns of California, Nevada, and Utah turned into ghost towns overnight. They were the instant subject of articles and guidebooks for automobile tourists . In 1967, someone published an atlas of them. Ghost towns represented the spatial end of history, and they were not the first candidates for talking about that subject. Crumbling buildings in slumside London and New York suggested the limits of development; entire regions slid into poverty with the shift of economic currents. Scotland's promising industrial revolution crashed after the 1850s; the American South was haunted by racial strife and soil exhaustion after the civil war. The limits of development were obvious; the traveler had only to look at the ghetto and the national periphery to raise difficult questions. For political economists of a sanguine temperament, crumbling peripheries simply evidenced the existence of racial hierarchy and the undeserving poor. Places that slid into starvation, such as Ireland, would be corrected by the market. Zones of underdevelopment were zones of opportunity, looked at correctly; if the undeserving Irish refused to labor, foreign investment would eventually develop their island. By the long depression of the 1870s, however, few writers could feel so bold about the places where depression hit. The economic disintegration of Scotland and the American South, the collapse of California boomtowns, and the constantly decaying stock of city slums all suggested . The burning of Paris under the commune reminded all that other futures were possible. - It is possible to map the places where such questions come up. In the nineteenth century, the zones where ghost towns seemed significant were a peculiar reflection of liberalism's failures. Collapse made travelers curious about the linked fates of home and empire. Archaeological sites in India and Persia made British administrators quiver at how easily their own empire might collapse. Roman ruins in England reminded Conrad and Masefield that all empires were fragile. The naturalist W. H. Hudson felt relieved when Roman walls were hidden by ivy. Such a curtain, he thought, should cover over all such failures of history lest men be discouraged. In Afoot in England (1909), a volume on birdwatching, Hudson quoted a Spanish poet whose name had lapsed to the same effect: “What of Rome; its world-conquering power, and majesty and glory – what has it come to?” Where progress itself was questioned, the next step was to ask whether ghost regions represented the future. Popular fantasy novels explored how free individuals would rise from the sites of decay. Abandoned cities set the scene for both H. Rider Haggard's She (1887) and later Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan (1912). Hudson's 1887 novel, A Crystal Age , predicted a that the twenty-first century would turn its back on both industrialization and cities, reinventing a rural paganism where the names of both Queen Victoria and Moses were equally forgotten. - What I found I really wanted to do, reading through these travel stories about decay, was to map the first places that came up when I asked Google Books or other archives for nineteenth-century texts with the words "crumbling cities" or "decaying cities" or "ghost cities" or "ghost towns." Where were they first noted, these cases of urban decay -- in Scotland? in California? on the fringes of empire? I needed a ten-minute map of a few -- say the first hundred -- just to trigger my mind. What are the patterns of disruption? Where was the periphery decaying? I turned to twitter for advice. Thanks to the amazing Bethany Nowviskie , digital guru at UVA, and Schuyler Erle of Brooklyn, for lending a hand. Thanks to Geomaker for the first working map. Nineteenth-century hits for "crumbling cities": Today, urban explorers , kids who break into abandoned buildings in the Rust Belt, see it before other people do. That geography is significant for a very important reason. Travelers who left zone of prosperity began to write about both history and the future in ways that challenged the dogmas of liberal progress. In losing their faith, they gained the ability to see around the curve of time. The map of decaying places, in other words, is invaluable to those trying to understand either history or their fate. Deindustrialization may be the future, after all; it was in Britain's future, and it may well be in America's. A geography of decay becomes the map of fantasies about alternatives to liberalism. My project, The Memory Machine, recently screened at the annual meeting of the History of Science Society, was filmed at the Detroit Book Depository. From 1923, when Melanie Klein published her psychological studies of children playing in sandboxes, to 1977, when the first studies of place cells were published, the primary field of new research in the mental processing of the landscape was child psychology. Piaget and Donald Winnicott claimed claimed to study the “infant’s point of view.” Piaget observed children drawing objects and discerned the lack of a sense of a Cartesian grid in their mental worlds; things that were emotionally near were reached for as if physically near. The psychoanalyst Edith Cobb, embarking on a long-term study of childhood experience, identified a formative period between five and twelve, when most of a child’s energy was directed not towards parents or friendships but rather towards place. At this age, she wrote, “the natural world is experienced in some highly evocative way, producing in the child a sense of some profound continuity with natural processes and presenting overt evidence of a biological basis of intuition.” Play for the infant, Winnicott argued, happened in a space with neither “inner psychic reality” nor “external reality.” He describes a dialectic between merging with mother and separation that is reduplicated with ev
ry nonliving object around the child, in particular blankets, teddy-bears, or other cherished objects that the child can alternately caress and attack, treating one moment as the human extension of her own body and the next as an insensate object, its button eyes to be torn out. The sense of self and otherness is therefore gradually formed in the “potential space between the individual and the environment.” The environment becomes thus infested with creative play that invests all objects in the immediate landscape with valuation, extrapolation, and association. Cobb showed children Rorschach tests and watched them play in sand boxes. She observed with fascination how the children seemed to express emotional attachment in play with objects more vividly than with people or animals. “I became acutely aware that what a child wanted to do most of all,” she wrote, “was to make a world in which to find a place to discover a self.” Winnicott defined two different kinds of childhood learning about the environment: the first, “favourable” outcome happens an abundance of individual symbols and fascinations projected onto the environment: “the potential space becomes filled with the products of the baby's own creative imagination.” The landscape where childhood play is allowed becomes “sacred to the individual” as the place where she “experiences creative living.” This is the world of play, characterized by a sense of wonder, free enjoyment, and easy association that Winnicott lauds as giving children a sense of the fullness of their own potential and the many riches of experience. It takes the form of turning any landscape into a magical wonderland, invested with the potential of encountering fairies or taking adventure. The second outcome, Winnicott argued, would happen in cases of “failure of environmental reliability,” when a baby absorbs adults’ perspectives on the environment. This form of learning teaches the child about zones of danger and safety, but discourages play, and so, Winnicott concludes, is less consistent with the individual development of an internal life, of the ability to critique authority, or of risk-taking behavior outside. Individual imagination in safe childhood exploration of landscape was thus set up against collective order of the environment and the manufacture of a disciplined, uncritical subject. Most adults, Winnicott argues, have experience of both playspace and discipline. Mature adults can return to access their mental worlds of play, the space of “unintegration,” which he defines as a “day-dream-like” state where fantasy, dream, and real world meet, inner projections applied and then separated from real-world objects, the limits of self and other readjusted. Only by relating to the landscape, he thought, did children have the opportunity of distinguishing themselves as independent entities, of parsing “the nature and interrelationship of inner and outer objects and worlds.” (Photo thanks: cc 2006 Ian ) Social science today has an opportunity to create an online infrastructure for social valuation that becomes participatory to a degree far exceeding the contemporary rule. While nineteenth-century social scientists worked for government elites, an online infrastructure designed to illuminate world view would place the tools of cultural observation within reach of many minds. Opening up representation of landscape has the opportunity to directly channel participation into urban planning, tax policy, housing policy, social services, and other aspects of the representation and administration of the physical landscape. It is hoped that application, articles, and videos will pioneer a new role for social science in the era of social networking technology, and foreground the cause of democratizing social science’s power. So long as government interests dominated the social sciences, the work of the social scientist aimed at influencing the work of the national government. Historian, sociologist and geographer worked to describe cases of state success and failure, expectant that the state would build according to their plans. The end of that political relationship opens up a radical opportunity. Social scientists in the age of the internet have the opportunity to work directly on behalf of communities without the interface of government. In the age of the internet, radical participatory information exchanges, market and political exchanges replace much of the work of the state. In such a setting, many of the social science’s traditional roles become irrelevant. Social scientists no longer advise a state in charge of designing public spaces where members of identity groups can safely meet. Informal, market-driven social servers such as LinkedIn.com, Facebook.com, and Myspace.com become significant forums for social exchange. Social scientists such as danah boyd have documented the divides of race and class in these sites. But who do they advise? There are no urban planners overseeing Facebook. Few social scientists have explored the radical opportunities available at the level of design. Launched from independent geeks, corporate start-ups, and computer science departments, new applications spring up constantly, tweaking the infrastructure of social exchange. One application allows Flickr.com photos to appear on Facebook’s wall. Another shows the user a rotating cloud of all the pictures semantically related to a given search term. Fundamentally, these applications are about making connections; their success actually depends upon broadening the internet’s infrastructure to become as participatory as possible. One of the greatest challenges to participatory exchange on the internet is the limit of transcultural boundaries. Users’ gender, class, race, and identity are obscured online, surfacing as an invisible law of self-association. Reduplicating the isolation of society at large, affluent whites on the internet share information with affluent whites, while the children of immigrants or immigrants themselves populate. Here the history of the academic disciplines provides insight. Social scientists employed by the state once combated ethnic segregation in the city by prescribing programs such as public housing designed to enhance identity assimilation. Their work tended to generalize racial differences into differences of violence, gender organization, and attitudes towards work. Armed with new forms social expertise – planners, architects, and geographers – charged with managing the boundaries between cultural worlds, based upon the assumption that the only way world views could be reconciled at large was through the management of the state. Nowhere was this trend clearer than among the experts who embarked upon a discipline new to the twentieth century, the study of cities. Urban scholarship flourished around what was becoming known as the “urban crisis,” the post-civil-rights-era phenomenon of black inner-cities ringed by ethnically divided white suburbs. Intellects as diverse as economist Edward Glaeser, geographer David Harvey and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. examined the historical health of urban administration with an eye to the future of racial integration in America. Geographers asked whether overcrowding in public housing contributed to interracial violence. Child psychologists asked whether access to green spaces influenced the development of creative powers. Social scientists intended to describe the ideal city, and they expected the state to build it. Their efforts, frequently belittling or primitivizing minority ethnicities, urged their students to concentrate upon designing a single, ideal, national landscape: a design for cities, frequently modernist, that would help immigrants of many backgrounds to assimilate to the same culture. By ignoring difference, they hoped to efface it. Their trajectory was marked by failure, and by the year 2000, Chicago and St. Louis were tearing down the housing projects erected under that regime. Faith in expert management of cultural infrastructure by sociologists and psychologists gave rise to an unprecedented level of authority being given modern urban planning. The public housing projects erected under their charge took American and British neighborhoods out of the hands of the local ethnic minorities who had built them. Far from the master travelers envisioned by early students of world view, twentieth-century planning aimed to assimilate ethnic minorities by effacing cultural difference. By contrast, in advising and enabling the oversight of design for online infrastructure, academics in the social sciences can facilitate collaborative knowledge making by communities about themselves. When the geographer Peter Gould sat down to write his autobiography in 1990, he looked over a career of mapping the perceptual spaces of Swedes, Tanzanians and college students. Over that life, he had repeatedly claimed that his major contribution to knowledge had been primarily in the service of the state. Gould was the man who figured out how to draw a picture of the version of the nation in a given individual’s head: ask the person to name all the cities they can in the United States; map those. The results remind us that human beings live in worlds of constructed of personal experience, not in atlases. New Yorkers can name all the boroughs and a smattering of places on the East Coast; Chicagoans can name factories in the Midwest with no resonance at all in San Francisco. The studies he produced were magically suggestive of the distance between worlds: children of fishermen can name and draw every cove round an island; not so those who live on the mainland. Even the citizens of relatively homogenous civilizations, he suggested, could be separated by experience into separate universes of perception, interest, and prejudice. For most of his career, Gould, like the geographers of his generation, claimed that these findings should interest state bureaucrats. Writing about his first “mental maps” in 1968, he claimed that his audience was bureaucrats “in government service” concerned with “income differentials” and the potential for relocating “migratory movements” in line with industry. Brian Berry of the University of Chicago was even more explicit, announcing to the Annual Conference of the Institute of British Geographers in 1970 that in the new world of “meritocratic élites,” geographers found themselves servants to the “needs of public policy.” He imagined a world where geographers would project the cities of the future that were “most likely to emerge in the future with and without public intervention” and so help functionaries decide and find the tools to shape the most preferable community possible. This was hardcore social engineering: the idea was that geographers, like psychologists and other social scientists, would aid the twentieth-century state in helping poor people and people of minority races to assimilate, or failing that, in Berry’s words, to “monitor” contemporary developments and so apprise authorities of outbreaks of danger before they happened. Geographers varied in which elites they thought they were advising. David Harvey’s early work specifically targeted the reform of federal mortgage administration. Yi-Fu Tuan emphasized not policy but rather urban planning, and hoped that his literary analyses of landscape would help designers to achieve “a habitat in concert with the full potential of our being.” Geographers varied as to which areas they thought most merited intervention. Gould claimed that his personal contribution was establishing that isolated islanders had trouble learning about jobs on the mainland; Ley and Cybriwsky used graffiti to discern the most troubled areas of black-Puerto Rican conflict in Philadelphia. Harold Rose defined the city center from St. Louis to Atlanta as a “high risk homicide environment.” Brian Barry was most worried about the poor blacks and white elderly isolated in the impoverished hinterland. Geography was to be the psychological surveillance arm of the state, tracing the zones of isolation and despair emerging around America, in order to more intelligently apply some combination of architecture, welfare, and policing. A significant group of geographers directed their findings towards the state's management of race. The Chicago School of sociology had mapped racial segregation of Chicago’s neighborhoods since the 1930s, but by blending of psychology and their mapping skills, a new generation of geographers began to rival them. Edward T. Hall’s study of public and private space, The Hidden Dimension (1966), blended studies of rats and slums to argue that overcrowded cities produced escalating acts of violence and decreasing fertility among females. The studies exploded in the 1960s, offering explanations to confused white Democrats who demanded to know why the passage of the 1965 Equal Rights Act had only resulted in further riots in Watts and Detroit. Applying terms like “overcrowding,” “territoriality,” and “isolation,” geographers charged into the causes and consequences of racial segregation in cities. The geographers located answers in American zones of isolation and hopelessness. Bill Bunge organized his fellow professors into the Detroit Geographical Expedition, leading frequent trips to document the slums of Detroit and later Toronto. Their findings were equally provocative. In 1968, the Society published a map entitled “Where Commuters Run Over Black Children on the Pointes-Downtown Track.” Life and death, they argued, were not merely the commodities available to any hard-working American, but hung upon the thread of a special kind of privilege, the privilege of safe territory. That privilege became all the more identifiable in the wake of a series of geographical investigations of racial covenants, which forbid people of color from owning property, and redlining, the practice setting racial qualifications for home loans within certain neighborhoods. Geographers documented the problem in 1960 and 1972, and in David Harvey explained that the high price of mortgages for blacks in Baltimore justified all Marx had said about the direct relationship between high rents and social exclusion. Describing the deep structuration of the urban crisis became the geographer’s favorite tool. Addressing the Association of American Geographers in 1978, its president, Harold Rose, coined the term “geography of despair” to interpret rising figures for homicide in black neighborhoods. Geographical investigation and race questions and climaxed in Zev Chafet‘s much-acclaimed Devil’s Night (1990), a book that defined the recent spate of black-on-black arson as reaction to white flight in a scene of hopelessness. Black hopelessness, among the social geographers, as the greatest social crisis of the moment, justified their concern. With so much evidence, it was all the more easy for implacable black hopelessness to become a convention of American belief. The surveying of racial crisis began with advising the state necessarily distanced the geographer from the place he described. Whatever the revolutions within geographers’ hearts, most of them reported, like Gould, to the state, more frequently advising urban planners, architects, and task forces than grassroots networks. They wrote about sexuality and violence in the slum. Rather than creating sympathy with the victims of race and class, their reports read like porn to the white audiences who consumed them. In The Hidden Dimension, Edward Hall drew parallels between overcrowded rats and contemporary black neighborhoods, indicting both as “behavioral sinks.” Documenting the spread of graffiti from ghetto backstreets to public highways in 1972, David Ley and Roman Cybriwsky explained a “behavioral primitive” akin to animals marking out territory. Even when taking a conciliatory attitude, privileged observers defined their subjects as the passive victims of environmental forces. Rose wrote of his study of homicide, “Youth who find difficulty establishing themselves in American society are less prone to abide by the norms of the larger society,” the direct result of which was untamed aggression among black and hispanic males, lashing out against strangers. Friedmann and Miller concluded, w
Humble living does not diminish. It fills. Going back to a simpler self gives wisdom. When a man makes up a story for his child, he becomes a father and a child &nbsp;together, listening. Before death takes away what you are given, give away what is there to give. No dead person grieves for his death. He mourns only what he didn't do. Wy did I wait? Why did I not . . . ? Why did I neglect to . . . ? I cannot think of better advice to send. I hope you like it. May you stay in your infinity. Peace. "One hundred and forty-seven of Rumi's letters survive. Many of them contain lines of poetry composed while writing the letters." The taste of today is not that of yesterday. A pot boils over. A watchman calls down the ladder, Did you hear the commotion last night from the seventh level? Saturn turns to Venus and tells her to play the strings more gently. Taurus milk runs red. Leo slinks from the sky. Strange signs, because of a word that comes from the soul to help us escape from speaking and concepts. I answer the nightwatchman, You will have to assign meanings for these ominous events. I have been set free from the hunt, the catching and the being caught, to rest in these dregs of flood residue, pure and empty. The open sky drinks from their circling cup. The sun wears the gold of their generosity. When two of them meet, they are no longer two. They are one, and six hundred thousand. The ocean waves are their closest likeness when wind makes from unity the numerous. This happened to the sun, and it broke into rays. The disc of the sun does exist, but if you see only the ray-bodies, you may have doubts. The human-divine combination is a oneness. Plurality, the apparent separation into rays. Friends, we are traveling together. Throw off your tiredness. Let me show you one tiny spot of the beauty that cannot be spoken. I am like an ant that has gotten into the granary, ludicrously happy, and trying to lug out a grain that is way too big. Sufi masters are those whose spirits existed before the world. Before the body, they lived many lifetimes. Before seeds went into the ground, they harvested wheat. Before there was an ocean, they strung pearls. While the great meeting was going on about bringing human beings into existence, they stood up to their chins in wisdom water. When some of the angels opposed creation, the Sufi sheikhs laughed and clapped among themselves. Before materiality, they knew what it was like to be trapped inside matter. Before there was a night sky, they saw Saturn. Before wheat grains, they tasted bread. With no mind, they thought. Immediate intuition to them is the simplest act of consciousness, what to others would be epiphany. Much of our thought is of the past, or the future. They are free of those. Before a mine is dug, they judge coins. before vineyards, they know the excitements to come. In July, they feel December. In unbroken sunlight, they find shade. In fana , the state where all objects dissolve, they recognize objects. Again it happens in my sleep. A core of wakefulness opens. But I have ways of ignoring that. You say, How long will you beg from others, when there are things born of you that emperors want? Why waste time in meanness? Who else can say what you say to me? If I could repeat it, people passing by would be enlightened and go free. You are an ocean in my chest where everyone changes places, believer-unbeliever, cynic-lover, dervish-king. Last night you came to my sleep asking, How are you? Locked out of life, waiting, weeping.
Back. Bigger. Better. Ok so I achieved 1 out of 3 of my promised Bs. I'm Back. Not bigger nor better, but I said I'd be back in February and we have a week of February left, so here I am. I'm so out of the blogging loop that I'm not even sure where to begin today. Thank you to everyone who sent me emails of support, kindness and friendship after my last blog post following the passing of my beloved best friend Alli. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to all of you, I did read them all and it was so touching to know that people from all over the world had sent their love. I have enjoyed my time offline but I'm pleased to back sharing my stories and cruising the blogosphere again. In the past five months my life has bounced up and down and up again. Constant, has been the love of family and friends and the really wonderful times I have with my little Tinker. Here we are below last week in Fiji enjoying a little family escape. My husband captured such a peaceful moment, we had a really relaxing time. Unless you count the feral hyper child on the plane. That sweet little redhead of mine is a hideous plane traveller! I'll be back soon with more news. So much has happened, I'm not even sure where to begin blogging again. I will put my thinking cap on with regards to achieving the other two Bs as promised. xx News flash! My blog will be back, bigger and better than ever in February. I've missed you all and can't wait to catch up again soon. Til then, that's all folks! xCarolyn In loving memory of my beloved best friend, Tinker's adored Godmother. Alli passed away yesterday after a long and courageous fight with cancer. Now she can finally rest peacefully. I will miss her always, forever my best friend, soulmate, Tinker's Godmother. xx This photo was taken just a few weeks ago. Special memories. Hi -big daggy wave- remember me? My surgery had to be cancelled because of an annoying infection in my lungs and now what was to be one little op is now going to be two little ops so I'm taking a little more time out while we work out the schedule of those and fuss about with phone calls to my favourite people ever. Hope you don't mind? I promise I'll be back soonish. I'll try to update my twitter account as well. My beautiful best friend Alli is in the hospital and she is very very ill so if you are the praying type I'd ask you to please get your prayers on and if you are not the praying type then please keep our beautiful girl in your thoughts. xxCarolyn image credit www.mauronne.com This beautiful image is courtesy of etsy seller lynndavis . Stunning isn't it? My friends I bid you farewell for a very short while. I will be back on the 14 th September, bigger and better. Ok well I'd prefer to be thinner and better but with all the genius inventions going on at my place I reckon I'll be double my size in 2 weeks. I am having an operation and I'll be out of action for a wee while. Don't worry I'll be just fine and I'll be back soon. I have a few exciting projects to share with you all on my return. Take care and I'll see you soon. Just don't ditch me for any of those perfect glamazon super mum blogs while I'm gone will you? x Carolyn This week's amazing giveaway had me wishing I could enter myself! I adore Gingerlilly Sleepwear, the fabric, the colours, the sexy but comfy designs and of course the gorgeous matching gift boxes... Someone is about to feel very very lucky. The little Tinker picked the winner first thing this morning under the watchful gaze of Henry and Beatrice. So, who won? -click pictures to enlarge- The 5th entrant. Who was that? Quick go back and count down... Simone you lucky duck, you are the winner!! Shoot me an email with your size and address and I will forward the details on to the lovely Vanessa so she can send out your prize. Thank you all for entering and providing such great comment about sleepwear design I think they will really be interest to Vanessa and her team. Of course the biggest thanks goes to Vanessa, thank you again for supporting Stepford Dreams with your amazing Gingerlilly Sleepwear . We love your store! xx The little Tinker is mad about funny animal videos on YouTube. I made the mistake of showing her one video of a swimming cat and ever since, she demands a new video once a day. Today's video is this silly fat cat dancing. She howls laughing and says "ok now watch it again please" over and over again. So you can thank Tinker for this week's FFF. Have a great Friday and a great weekend! Not one to blow my own horn, well not too loudly anyway... however on this occasion I feel that it is warranted. I have invented something so spectacular, something so ingenious that I may have to shut down this blog to keep up with the hoards of fans I'm likely to get once I tell you about my latest feat of brilliance. For the non-Aussies, it may not be clear why this is so fantastic but if you have ever tried a Kingston biscuit you will know that it is impossible to keep a packet in your pantry for more than oh 12 hours. Right? Well yesterday in a flash of creativity I created my very own Kingston biscuit only it's better. Seriously. Masterchef watch out because I am now the champion. Those two blonde bogans with the patronising piercing voices from QLD who are famous for 4 ingredient recipes also need to watch out because this brilliant invention requires only 2 ingredients. ANZAC biscuits and Nutella . Genius. Get 2 ANZAC biscuits and put 2 spoonfuls of Nutella between them. That is all you need to do. Now, step away from the computer, go to your pantry and try it. What kind of Aussie mum has a pantry lacking ANZAC biscuits? Now get your Nutella and get going. All those size zero glamazon mummies with your 26 children in matching outfits, your perfect show homes and your handmade, home made fancy pants everything can go and sulk in the corner with your pipe cleaners and home made spelt pretzels because this invention trumps everything. I dare you to come back here and tell me I'm not not a genius. edited to add: I've had quite a few emails from some of my overseas readers. Now don't panic. You will not miss out on my genius because the ANZAC spirit is lacking in your "cookie" aisle. Yes we say biscuit and you say cookie. Click here for my previous ANZAC post, if you scroll down you will see I have a really dead easy recipe for you to make the ANZAC biscuits at home. Even I can't ruin them, easy easy easy.
Suppose you want to buy a cart horse. Of course for most of us, this isn't likely but for a lot of people it is much like buying a used car. You need to look it over to see that there are no dings and scratches and then you need to see how well it accelerates and so on. But how to do that? At some of the horse fairs they tie a wheel of a cart to keep in from rolling and then ask the horse to move it quickly. Every so often I go to get some more dog food for the ridiculous number of dogs who live at my farm. As I sit in the jeep waiting for 10 bags of kibble to be carried to me I look at a shop right next door where they do something to cars, I believe. I've never seen them do it, but they have an interesting array of objects hanging over the sidewalk. I wonder what they are. This young man took me back to my childhood in a flash. The joys of dangling a hook and line into a body of water, no matter how faint the possibilities of catching a fish, had to be some of the greatest in the world. A week ago I was hosting a group of high school students at the farm and their bus managed to run off the dirt road into a ditch. My jeep isn't exactly big enough to drag even a small school bus back to the track, but happily my neighbours happened to have a bulldozer handy. They came over and very, very carefully lifted the bus back onto the road. What would we do without our neighbours? This is a lovely balady Arab mare with her sturdy mule son at her side. He's only two months old now so by the time he's weaned, he will know pretty much everything he needs to know about driving. The horse fair refreshment stand at the horse fair is a tiny bit spare. But it got lots of business from the buyers and sellers of horses, donkeys, and equipment get thirsty bargaining. While on a shopping trip with friends in Old Cairo we saw this man repairing folding chairs with new seats and backs. The sticks to his right are parts of garden umbrellas. Good repairs on things here are not very expensive and most people will repair rather than replace. A lot of work in Egypt is done in the street. There are some big garages that can repair cars inside but on Road 9 there is a well-known mechanic who works in the road outside a small shop containing parts. When business is slow, there's usually a place to sit.
Temperatures at Lola can hit 90oF with 100% humidity. Here is Manono, our Olympic swimmer having a little dipphoto: David Reid Not sure if you remember the furore of the bigfoot photo where someone actually took my photos and entered it into a bigfoot competition! but now the original bigfoot, Bandundu, has finally grown some hair. Which is lucky b/c now her baby has something to hold onto!photo: David Reid I always love photos of the photos with the lilies - they look so romantic - liek htey're just inhaling their faint heady scent. But actually it's the scene before they chomp them up - which doesn't look so romantic - petals shredded everywhere. I've heard of bonobos foraging for pith (the bit inside the lily stem)- that ties into Richard Wrangham's theory of the aquatic ape. And bonobos do hae a bit of webbing between their 2nd and 3rd toe.But I haven't heard of them eating flowers before...photo: David Reid This is little Bisengo, who I have known since he was born. He is the perfect example of an alpha bonobo. So we usually say that the females are in charge of bonobo groups, but actually it the babies - especially a little prince like Bisengo who can get anything he wants! If there is a grape within even 10 feet of Bisengo, it's his, no matter who else is around!Bisengo is quite a little climber - maybe a prime candidate for the release project?
Something to finish off your outfit from the previous post? I love these beautiful jewel encrusted bangles from Emma Cassi's new collection. I know many of you loved my frilled dress from a few posts ago so here is a little collection of shear spring delicates that can be layered together from Topshop. The shopping centre is a danger zone for me and my credit card at the moment. Probably need to get some blinkers fitted to stop me peeking in the windows and seeing all the pretty dresses on display. I had such a lazy weekend, never even got out of my pyjamas or left the house. I need to get up and baking soon and then get out in that beautiful sunshine that is blazing through my windows. Have a great Monday I hope you haven't all had to work? I love the wonder on the faces of the train passengers as they get off the train at Carlisle station after one of Homebase's guerilla makeovers. How fun would it be to randomly do one of these makeovers in your neighbourhood? Maybe I will take on a park bench or bus shelter of my own when warmer weather finally arrives. I can't believe it is Thursday already. I had such a lovely weekend, chilly but lovely, we spent Sunday in Lewes. Breakfast at Bills, I had grilled vine tomatoes - rocket, basil and balasamic on toasted sourdough. We peeked in a few shops, then came home. A rosy setting sun and supper from Middle Farm. Sweet apples with bread and cheese. The rest of the week has flown by. I am so looking forward to Spring, this new cold snap is lasting so long. Up early to add a few new paper garlands to the shop before I head out, I have the day off today and after a week of bitter cold but sunny days today of course is grey grey grey. Although there is a tiny crack in the clouds a seam of light which makes me hopeful. Maybe I will meet my friend and be able to drink my coffee outside? Still obsessing over ruffles of all kinds, especially ones made of frothy lace and chiffon then encrusted with sequins and beads. You will have to bear with me as I think this is an everlasting condition. Todays close ups are from the Elie Saab Spring 2010 couture collection over at Style.com After a wild night out I woke up on Sunday morning to find this beautiful film in my mailbox. A real day saver. I instantly fell in love. With the styling the music and Alison's red hair. I will watch it over and over. This stop motion short was made by Angela Kohler and her boyfriend Ithyle, with Alison Sudol from A Fine Frenzy. I know you will enjoy the film as much as me, So I sent Angela over some questions and I am so glad she had time to answer them. Pop over and take a look at Angela's wonderful portfolio too. What was the inspiration behind this piece? We wanted to make a visual journey, and we collaborated with Alison from the beginning, talking about the motifs that she likes in her personal life and in her music. We went to flea markets and picked up objects that inspired us, then we built the piece around all of those elements. How long did it take to make? 3 days. We built the fake floor in our studio in one day, then shot the film in 2 days. When we were done Ali was pretty sore and from laying on her back on a wood floor for so long, and we all had a few splinters. It took a week to clean up. Were there any parts of the film that were particularly hard to capture? The Ocean scene was an experiment with string. We thought it would look amazing and flow, but it was really hard to get the enormous pile of yarn to be hidden behind her skinny little waist before it began to stretch to the edges of the frame. She was teetering on this giant yarn ball trying to be comfortable. And our dog kept running off with pieces of it. Who is the music by ? Alison Sudol of A Fine Frenzy (who is the main character in the piece) crafted the music to fit the film and Butch Walker engineered and produced it. Where or who are all the dresses from / made by? Most of the clothing was vintage. Who or what are some of your creative influences? We are inspired by things around us. Old things. Things with texture and history. We do a lot of "hey look at this" to each other. I think if it is beautiful, it inspires us. Do you have anymore that you are working on? We are currently working on a series of advertisements for the Amazon Kindle as well as a bunch of personal projects, we are a little OCD, there is always some idea that we can't keep our minds off of. Thanks again Angela. Happy Saturday. I am so in love with everything pretty. Always have been. So it should be with extra caution that I set foot on the high street right now. But alas it is reckless abandon that rules my heart when I see all these vintage style sugared almond coloured frills and layers. If I promise to wear them every day will that go a little towards making up for my shopping misdemeanours?
Fun tea towels can really perk up a kitchen (and they make great present wrapped around a bottle of wine). I like these friendly whales . P.S. More dish towels . (Via Lena ) Now that we're so close to meeting our little guy , I've been gazing at babies on the street and looking up baby photos on flickr. I just can't get enough of babies! This flickr photo called " brushing our teeth " is so cute, it makes my heart hurt. Love this anchor tote (and it's denim!). Only $20 from A.P.C. Everyone hopes for sun on their wedding days, but sometimes rain and fog can be even more romantic, don't you think? Emily and Jasen got hitched in the Hudson Valley on a foggy day, and their photos are magical. P.S. A very rainy wedding . (Photos by Our Labor of Love ) My sweet readers, what are you up to this weekend? Alex and I are actually escaping to Los Angeles and Palm Springs for a week, for a final vacation before the baby arrives. We rented this cottage in L.A., and will be staying at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs. I'm so excited to go swimming and just relax. Next week, I've scheduled some favorite photographs to post every day, so please continue to visit, if you'd like. Meanwhile, here are a few great posts from around the web...xoxo Oh my goodness, this baby was born in a CAB ! Spring lip colors . Yummy-looking sandwich . Green postcards . (Just add water.) Love this braid . Funny cafe sign . This post makes me so wanderlusty! Pretty print . This made me laugh. " I'd Rather Be Thrifting ." (I know about twenty girls who need that print.) Cute sailing tee . San Francisco is so gorgeous. The Luther burger would give you a heart attack but it might be worth it. What a playful wedding . Bonus for all readers: Journelle , an amazing lingerie shop (and one of this month's sponsors), is offering 15% off with the code CUPOFJO. Plus, five Cup of Jo posts you might have missed: - Twenty-four different accents . - Wedding makeup . - Cacio e Pepe . - Side knot . - Seagull tote . (Photo credit unknown) Since those Jenga photos a couple days ago mysteriously hid my giant belly, here's a shot that I took that same night to send to my mom. (I wasn't going to post it because I have a weird expression and the lighting is all yellow, but oh well, here you are!) I snapped it in our living-room mirror while Alex was cooking dinner. Recently the baby has been kicking SO much, and it is ridiculously cute. He's so kicky that if I lean back while watching TV, my tummy will actually ripple, like waves in the ocean. It's really sci-fi and awesome to watch him bumping around, and, needless to say Alex and I find it endlessly endearing. Thank you so much for being so sweet, as always; it's such a treat to share everything with you. xo My sister sometimes paints her nails rad colors (yellow, baby blue), so I think she'd love these space nails . (Via Krisatomic ) Oh my goodness, Jordan 's friend Aubrey put together this "installation" for her boyfriend's birthday! How absolutely fabulous is that?! Bonus: Under each orange is a sweet birthday note from a loved one. Genius. (Via Oh Happy Day )
First of all, I love the name of the blog that this cabinet comes from - The Chubby Dove ! Who doesn't love picturing a portly little bird with a paintbrush? I love everything about this restored cabinet, including the color. My current favorite craft paint color is FolkArt Patina , and this is very close. Chubby Dove does a great job distressing and restoring. Go here to read more about it and see it before the jump. In other news, I want to make you aware of a Couture Cardstock review I did for Paper Crafter's Corner . Now that I'm making cards like it's going out of style, I whipped up a few using Couture Cardstock's fantastic line. Go here to see a few more of my projects, and also enter to win some Couture Cardstock product AND a Mod Podge starter pack. Good luck! I must admit that I sometimes overlook doilies. I've been seeing them around a little more than usual for whatever reason, and every craft I've seen them on, I've loved. That includes these tealights and matchbox from the gals at Mint . It's a design that is a worthwhile visit in and of itself, but the fact that they use Mod Podge makes it a must-see. Visit here for a tutorial on the goodies above. I love that they are so dainty and Anthropologie-esque. This is the official bathroom of Mod Podge Command Central. There IS a point to this picture, by the way, not just to show you my toilet. Remember when I did the AllModern.com giveaway not so very long ago? Well, I also ordered a Dwell Studio shower curtain and I LOVE it! My bathroom needed a sprucing and I have always liked Dwell Studio - I was tickled pink to see that Dwell makes shower curtains and one specifically with animals and blues (my favorite color). So here she is . . . what do you think? Anyway, I can't say enough good things about AllModern.com and CSN Stores , who provided the giveaway for you and sent me my shower curtain. They have awesome products. You must go visit them today! Time for the giveaway! I think you remember the rules, but just in case: 1. Comment on THIS blog entry. I LOVE my new shower curtain. What recent purchase or gift do you love? 2. Only one entry per person. 3. Contest will close every Wednesday at midnight (EST). 4. PLEASE leave your e-mail address if it's not attached in Blogger - I need some way to reach you. Last week was awesome - you introduced me to so many tools I hadn't heard of! Last week's winner was Scrap Bat. What is that in the picture you ask? It's a nightstand, done by Chase. Her mom, Amy (who writes the blog Chaser, Boo and Mommy Too! ) is super cool - I wish my mom had let me Mod Podge my furniture! I always enjoy seeing children Mod Podge. If you are a mom and you don't already know, Mod Podge is completely non-toxic and safe for the kiddies. Which I like because then I know it's safe for me too. Back to the dresser - it's very cute and worth a visit here to see more pictures of the action. It's Friday, and that means it's my post for Torendi . That means it's another adventure in cardmaking! The glue is not even all the way dry on this baby because of the last minute button addition: Meet the colorful circus bird of thanks. I had so much fun with this one, because I love the brights. This uses several items from the Torendi March 2010 Kit " Framed Cuteness ." I want to thank you all and the academy for your support as I move through this cardmaking process. I do have a confession though - I didn't use Mod Podge in this project! Before you gasp, keep in mind that it's a challenge for me NOT to. I'm giving away the starter pack today to celebrate Torendi month, and you'll see me resume my Podging again next week. Supplies Cardstock: American Crafts (red), Couture Cardstock (lavender), Sassafrass Nerdy Bird "Sprightly" collection Punch: Fiskars oval scalloped Die Cutter: Sizzix Big Shot, Tim Holtz Alterations Collection Cage Bird Die Stamp: American Crafts Thanks Collection Ink: W R Memory Keepers Tiffany Set Ribbon: American Crafts Allure Paper Flowers: Prima Iced Got Flowers in Tiffany Teal Adhesive: Glue Dots and Tacky Glue Accents: Buttons and Mini Pop Dots And now, the giveaway - the rules are very easy: 1. I'm giving away one starter pack every Friday for the month of March when I post my Torendi card (this is in addition to my typical Sunday giveaway). 2. You must be a US resident, one entry per person. 3. Comment on this blog entry. This week, you have to visit one of the Torendi Design Team blogs (list featured the upper left side of my blog) and tell me one of the projects that you like! 4. Contest ends tomorrow night, 3/13, at midnight EST. BONUS - at the end of this gig, on March 26th, Torendi is giving one of their fab fabrics away to a lucky person who has left a comment on a Friday during the month. AND ONE LAST THING. This month is National Craft Month! Plaid (makers of Mod Podge) is celebrating, so you need to head to their website Plaid Online to see projects like the Fabric Mod Podge wall hangings I did below. Aren't you proud of me? They are also having a huge promotion on craft goodies like Mod Podge so you might wanna stock up. I'm just sayin'! I just recently posted Kristen's owl caddy , but I couldn't just leave it at that. Her site, Kristen Powers Ink , is too intriguing and has too many fun Mod Podge projects. This robox, which is a basically a robot out of a matchbox with some other recycled goods, is an example of one of those projects. You need to go here to learn more about him. He could be a necklace too - go see - you aren't going to believe it. I had the pleasure of discovering Tammy's work on my trip to CHA in late January. There's no other word to describe her than amazing! She did some design work for Basic Grey that I saw at the show, including the piece above (created with their Cappella collection ). The only way to do Tammy justice is to send you to her blog to poke around and see all the beautiful things she's doing. Visit the canvas above right here and a coordinating frame right here . It's all so, so pretty! I don't know about you, but I'm so ready for spring. I'm also ready to fix up the lame, plain clay pots I have housing my plants on the porch of Mod Podge Command Central. I like the ones shown above by Christine of lavender and limes . So simple, so cute and for the small pots you can use one larger scrap of fabric from your stash. For the big pots, you could still use fabric from your stash - just piece it together in patchwork-like fashion. Before you start, head here to Christine's blog to get her step-by-step. Don't forget to use Outdoor Mod Podge - then you can keep these outside without fear.
House guests this week. YAY for friends who make you giggle! Here is another ironic observation courtesy of Emily Dickinson. Enjoy! A Bird Came Down the Walk A bird came down the walk, He did not know I saw; He bit an angleworm in halves And ate the fellow, raw. And then he drank a dew From a convenient grass, And then hopped sidewise to the wall To let a beetle pass. by Emily Dickinson If I were a one-eyed-one-horned-flying-purple-people-eater," would that mean I am purple or that I eat purple people? You see, I love my job. But there's not enough of it. That's the problem. The economy is still sinking like a leaky dinghy, and my chances of getting even a part-time position with a 401k option is as unlikely as patching that hole at the bottom of the boat. It worries me that I have no retirement. It worries me that I don't earn enough. But then, what if I actually did land a traditional 9-5 job that offered benefits? But, then again, what if I couldn't learn the job? What if the job had minimal flexibility? What if the commute was hell? What if I couldn't stay awake? I would have to accept the position, but what about the kids? They have appointments and therapy and bad days at school. I have anxiety. But I don't want that to get in the way. Truth be told, I love what I do. I feel confident I could do more of it because it's what I know. I know how to work around my neurological challenges and my family's schedule. I know how to juggle priorities. I know how to expand my scope. I'm good at what I do. And I have awesome co-workers. This isn't a new situation for me. As an undergrad, I worked in Disability Services where I provided tutoring. I could schedule my work around my classes. The students benefited. So did I. I took on projects that no other tutor had in the past. My boss was amazing and flexible and supportive. I was motivated. But the job didn't pay enough, and I had no benefits. And then, I graduated. No more job. It was a student position. I've had other awesome bosses since then--understanding and supportive. They knew I was a little neurotic but that my neurosis didn't prevent me from doing my work. They also knew they could depend on me to be creative. Yesterday, I planned to go to a Federal Government job fair out in Stafford. Over 6,000 people turned out. The State Police had to direct long lines of traffic, and the lines at the booths were not much better. In fact, there were lines to get into the building. Not having experience in government, I wouldn't have much of a chance to land a position that worked out for the employer, me and my family. Now I might sound like I'm just being negative, but I'm not. I am being realistic. With all the competition around, who needs another writer, especially one that requires accommodations? I know I'm useful. I read so many poorly written communications that I wonder why organizations don't hire MORE writers and editors. I guess they don't want to spend the money. My perfect job? Write and edit mostly from home. Work flexible hours. Have a shot at accruing sick time, vacation time and a retirement fund. I don't need health insurance. I don't need huge amounts of supervision. I don't need a cubicle. I don't even need full-time. There are millions of people looking for jobs right now, and many are in worse shape than we are. Typically, that would put things in perspective, but it doesn't when I look at our paycheck-to-paycheck existence. And it's worse because I know I am the weak link here. I'm not depressed. I am anxious. I can't communicate this angst to hubby, or he WILL get depressed. I will never give up, because that's not how I am. But I can't get my hopes up, either. Er, anyone else scared? Sound like anyone you know? Caper Literary Journal publishes quality prose and poetry. I stumbled upon an archived piece that really struck me, especially considering our poor economy and the rise in the numbers of poverty stricken. Jame G. Piatt starts "A Letter to a Teacher" like this: Dear teacher: Do you know I can’t see the board from the back of the room because I need glasses, but my mom can’t afford to buy them? I really want to learn those important things you write on the board, but I am afraid to sit in the front with all of your good kids. Be sure the read the rest. This isn't just a message for teachers. It should be a billboard on the Interstates. How about a little more understanding?

But no one listens.” “Wal-mart says they only use eco-friendly products. But their light bulbs aren’t.” “We don’t need any more houses. Why can’t they just stop building?” Mangy magazine pages and bread bags claim our bony trees, last year’s Robin’s eggs decay, a deck peels five years of paint, windows need replacing. My children’s retro music condenses on the glass: “Oh we’re never gonna survive.” --Katherine M. Gotthardt I would be remiss if I did not address the Bob Marshall incident on my own blog, particularly because Bob Marshall is my Delegate in state government; I have disabilities; both my children have disabilities. Marshall made the following comments regarding children with disabilities, implying that they are "punishment" for women who have had abortions. As stated in the Gainesville Times, here is the full quote, which Marshall conveniently leaves out in his “explanation” which is posted on FOX online: “The number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion w ith handicaps has increased dramatically. Why? Because when you abort the first born of any, nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children,” said Marshall, a Republican. “In the Old Testament, the first born of every being, animal and man, was dedicated to the Lord. There’s a special punishment Christians would suggest.” There is no doubt about it–he is “suggesting” women are punished with disabled children. Look at the juxtaposition of the words he used. Apparently, in his world, God takes his wrath out on children and mothers, whether they have had abortions or not. Marshall is trying to say that's not what he meant. I say he is full of shit. If Marshall wanted to address the issue of state funding for Planned Parenthood, which does provide abortion services in addition to other reproductive services, then that is what he should have addressed. Instead, he took what he deems the word of God and used that to condemn all women with children who have disabilities. In doing so, he condemns anyone with disabilities. In an astounding attempt to redeem himself, Marshall tries to explain the evils of Planned Parenthood by attacking minority communities: "“Thank you very much for coming here today. We are dealing with an attempt to defund , frankly, a malevolent organization. And I say that because you know people by their fruits. In 1960, 65, the out of wed-lock birthrate for blacks was 25 percent. I think it was about 23 percent in 1960 – it was 5 percent for all races. Now it’s 40 percent. It’s 72% for blacks, 51% for Latinas. These are the fruits of planned parenthood. OK. Nothing else. More heartache. More guys who are completely irresponsible and think that women have one function and one function only for a few minutes. OK. But this just isn ’t affecting our families, our inner cities, our communities and our state. This poison animates a world-wide population control program that the United States funds and which is unnecessarily making us enemies overseas. We are attacking traditional family structure in a way that no country should be doing." So now, Marshall targets minority communities and blames PP for the demise of the impoverished and vulnerable. Now let ME clarify I do not believe abortion should be publicly funded; I believe abortion is a moral, medical choice that no woman should ever have to make--not a governmental issue; I believe in education and prevention; I believe some reproductive counselors promote abortion; I would never condemn a woman who has had an abortion; I believe our adoption system is broken which only serves to encourage abortion. I've discussed abortion on this blog before, and I have discussed disabilities. I won't do it in depth again here. If anyone is really interested, search "abortion" and "disabilities" on this blog. Though I didn't agree with many of Marshall's issues positions before, I used to respect him as a smart man deserving of office. I no longer feel that way. I may add to this post later.
Today was the day. Today was the day I spent all afternoon in my kitchen, blissfully free in bare feet and with the living room window open, cool air kissing around my legs as my long skirt swished and moved. Today spring was like a voice in my head, the one that talks with a rhythm spun out&nbsp;on gypsy jazz, all bouncy nonsense and playful lisps. Spring and autumn are my most sensually extravagant times. In the fall I go mad for plums and the first of the root vegetables. All of my body seems to gravitate to my hips and legs, those pillars that are heavy on the earth, intimate with its lumbering ways. But in the spring I’m all toes and fingers and buzzing brain. When that sun finally finds its way into me I am like a newborn thing, fresh and wide open to every passing scent and sight. Yesterday I shopped. I bought bright things: a pink shirt, a purple one, one with red roses, a blue bra, a little white sweater. The air was cool but the sun was out and as warm as I have felt it in forever, so I swung my shopping bags and sashayed from store to store. Today I dyed my hair a little blonder, looked in the mirror to see my blue eyes glow just a little brighter. Tomorrow my beloved visits and I wanted to prepare something that exudes my current heightened state of deliciousness. A collaboration of many, many good things. So I have cooked up a traditional lasagne, made the rich tomato sauce, simmered it long and slow with garlic, onions, carrot, torn pieces of salty prosciutto, a good dash of white wine and a massive handful of fresh, soft, fragrant basil. The ragu alone took three steps and plenty of cooking, and when it was finished I alternated between squeals of excitement and groans of pleasure. Oh, it is good. The lasagne waits to be baked, gorgeous strips of mozzarella and the rest of the prosciutto tossed around atop the creamy white sauce that covers the pasta. Forty minutes in the oven and if the aroma does not seduce my Scotsman, then my kitchen witch days are numbered. For dessert I have made mousse chocolat, a Green and Black’s dark chocolate wonder with a slosh of French brandy. For now they also sit in the fridge, bittersweet clouds drawn down from their formations and piled into wine glasses. Oh my, spring is here. Mmmmm…tangy. Take the first song you hear and make yourself at home, all that languid hope lost on strings and rhythmic vibrations. Pretend you live in a place that is both old and saturated with sunlight. The kind of place where lemon trees grow in the front gardens of old ladies who dress in black and wear head scarves. They bicker like all the other old ladies in the world, except they have lemon trees in their gardens and their feet know the arch and&nbsp;angle of every cobble on their street. This afternoon as I was walking home my head was caught in a cloud of scent. Lilacs, as if suddenly I was about to crash into a mountain of them, pollen raining down and staining my skin and clothes. But when I looked I saw only a small plant inside a grocery bag which was being carried by the woman in front of me. I thought:&nbsp;I want to be as bold as that plant, issuing such an exuberant pulse into the world that doesn’t expect it. Think of&nbsp;kissing strangers just as they are on the brink of a decision, then stepping back and watching everything they have ever been slip from their expressions. They can’t remember where they are, who they have been, what they were thinking. They can only feel the breath that has left their lungs and the ghost of your lips on theirs. Leave them before they find their way back to themselves. Store up those strange, blissful manifestations. Know that periodically throughout their lives, they will remember that moment as if it were some porthole to themselves that they haven’t found since. I can’t remember the last time I was barefoot outside. I think it has been cold forever, even though the sun blazed into my eyes as I walked down Princes Street and resisted crossing and going into the bookstore. Even though there are tiny flowers poking up through the grass in the park and the teenage boys are starting to venture out in t-shirts, their hands dug deep into their pockets as they pull their shoulders forward and attempt to create warmth inside the curves of their chests. No, I can’t stop thinking about&nbsp;a land of olives and sundried tomatoes and fruit that squishes juice almost as soon as you touch it. Somewhere you can still feel the warmth in the stones of the buildings all the way until the evening, until eventually the night pulls the last of it out like the final little shudder after an orgasm. The one that makes your whole body relax and sends you off to sleep. People keep telling me spring is coming. But it isn’t enough. I need to be filled with the sun, bathed in it, turned over in it until not one inch of my skin remains&nbsp;cool to the touch. I want to be like the Lilac, like the stones in the evening. A giant pulse, a little shudder. Bliss. Gee, what did you do this weekend, Sophia? Not much. Farmers' Market, bit of cooking. Oh, and I wandered around the city taking photos of a sock monkey . And you? What did you get up to? -found this today. Written a few years ago to beloved friends of mine. I miss you so much I would snuggle down in those words if it wasn't 30 degrees So I've put them in the freezer Every once in awhile I take them out and give them a lick There is a hint of saskatoon and full moon first frost stirred with rosehips and honey. Tasted individually The I holds the metallic purity of an icicle snapped from where it was hanging from the roof of a lonely (but snug) cabin. Both M's are all berry bliss the sun finding a way to drip and swell. I have to linger over ss to coax out the cinnamon the autumn waiting bees tucking away their stings. Y is surprisingly cherry flavoured while Ou is milky, a cream stirred so long and with such love that it can only be eaten scooped straight from the bowl with a hooked finger. The single small s is bursting with sun-warmed wild strawberry The kind I crouched over and plucked as a child Popping their ruby bodies into my mouth before performing the miracle - my tongue crushing them against my palate loving and destroying them in one sweetsour second. The o which follows holds the tang of snow freshly fallen and grazed upon from where it is heaped on the wooden railing. u how much can this letter hold? The tang of it keeps changing one second it's salty broth like the perfect veggie stock sipped from a hot spoon Then smoke the flavour used to purify a space in the spring sandlewood freshly peeled birch bark pine needles and the first shoots of dandelion leaves The spices may alter but u always holds the zest of an offering. ch is a fast-melting orange juice popsicle clear ice crystals becoming exposed as the juice is frantically sucked It works if you make the sound while breathing in It becomes the noise of a locomotive chugging backwards through slush Overall Five single syllables have made me feel so much better And I am taking a moment to thank you before I head once again to the freezer Today it snowed. Driving, freezing sleet. I am waiting for the world to change its perfume, waiting&nbsp;to feel the heat from the sun make an exchange with the soil, to walk through the haze of it, feel my body remember. For Renee : I love knowing that by late this afternoon I'll be in his flat, already laughing and sharing details of our day. Two trains and a hike uphill&nbsp;- I know the route so well now. And if it's nice tomorrow I'll head out for adventures, seeing what I can see. Last weekend I saw some shells, and since I resisted picking them up, I collected their images instead.
Another sad-but-interesting addition to my frozen menagerie - a Redwing that had died after flying into a window.Before I put it in the freezer (for later study - not eating), I stretched out its wings and wondered about the night-time journey on which the same feathers, muscles and bones carried it across the North Sea where did it make landfall? Scotland? Yorkshire? Suffolk?where it hatched last year - Sweden or Russia, perhaps?and saw how it still had fragments of soil stuck to its toes.I suppose it must have been foraging amongst the leaf litter until a few minutes before it died. It's really quite sad.
Here's an early version of a book cover concept I did a while back. I'm posting it because I just rediscovered it and think it's kinda cute, even if the direction changed a bit. Lordy! What a week!! I know, I know...it's not quite over yet...but for me, IT IS. I am done! The "universe" tested me in a big way over the past many days but I did manage to meet my deadlines (with happy clients!!) while dealing with all the other hoopla. So, for that I say "hallelujah" and let me get the hell out of town! I'm taking off to the desert tomorrow morning. It'll be really nice for a change of scenery. Happy Weekend, People! xo Here's a couple recent goodies commissioned by the fine folks at Astro Girl! Magazine. Typically,I don't like throwing copyright smack dab in the center of my art BUT, I figured it would make it less appealing to theft that way. Not that I think there's a big crime ring focusing on astrological symbols or anything. It was only after consulting my charts and the recent Harvest Moon, I figured... better safe than sorry !! Just kidding, if I really looked at my charts I wouldn't know what the "stars" I was looking at anyway. Heck, all I know about a Harvest Moon is that it looks ginormous and brilliant and almost fake (like, the backdrop painting of a school play). And, "Harvest Moon" is the title of my all time favorite Neil Young song. If you don't know it, check it out. Even while admitting my lack of astro-knowledge I don't mean to imply that I wouldn't or don't read my horoscope...because I do! Not every day...sometimes it's merely the perfect tool for procrastinating a few minutes longer. Anyway, I take it all in stride. Since my birthday falls on the CUSP of Libra/ Scorpio...I read both 'scopes and pick the one I like best. ;) I know even less about Tarot cards but find them fascinating if not a little frightening. I'd love to learn more about 'em because I think it'd be fun to draw a whole set someday. In the interest of keeping things fresh I've decided it's high time I start posting doodles and sketchies. So..okay! I'm doing it. I'm kind of a sucker for those ragtag magazines at the checkout stands...and sometimes, late at night, I doodle from those pages. Here's a couple to start...fresh with some newly added photoshop color for added zest. Here's Lindsey. Good Ol' Susan Boyle...before the makeover. More to come! Here are some silly little illos I did for the upcoming issue of Yikes! Magazine. Have you experienced anything like this? I certainly have! That said, I choose NOT to share with you the couple wardrobe mishaps I've had in my early life. Let's just say this though..both incidents that come to mind were pretty em-bare-ASS-ing. Ah yes, here's another 10k I won't be participating in...other than, designing the t-shirt logo. For one, the trail run is in San Antonio. TEXAS. I don't mess with Texas. Secondly, I hate, hate, hate running. I'm a terrible runner. I might sprint for half a block with my dog but that's the extent of it for me. I might run away from a bad guy too...but let's face it, I'd probably have to resort to eye-gouging. Walking, hiking, swimming...those are more my speed. Even when I was in grade school and they made us run around the track...I abhorred it. It just hurts too much. Would love to change my attitude about it someday because I know it's a great way to drop some LBS and tone. But, blech...I just hate it. Anyway...trying to follow the theme of the drawing here...which also includes a Jalapeño! I looooooove japapeño.... in fact, I made some awesome spicy salsa the other night. Hot! Spicy! Pure Goodness. And now the (jalapeño) seed has been planted: I will be dreaming about carne asada tacos from a local taco stand (or truck)...sprinkled with cilantro, onion and spicy salsa that makes my mouth on fire. And I will be thinking about this until it happens. Later, today. YES. Here's a couple images I snagged from the internet of the "Los Chupacabras De La Noche" race held in San Antonio, Texas a couple weekends ago. I don't know the runners personally but I did the Chuy (pronounced Chewie!) drawing. It's very cool to see people wearing a t-shirt with my drawing on it. I hear the t-shirts turned out really good this year too! My samples should be arriving any day. Woo Hoo! Last year's design is available here . Please check out the beautiful graphic memoir, "The Imposter's Daughter" written and illustrated by Laurie Sandell . Out in bookstores July 29th! -- BTW, I colored the book from cover to cover. How'd that happen? Well... In May 2008, I got an e-mail from a writer living in New York who wanted ME to color her graphic novel. To which I replied "Hells YES!". I did so because first, it sounded so cool and well, quite frankly I wanted to be very busy with a "perfect summer gig!". In reality, it took much, much longer than the summer though. The assignment pretty much took the entire year. Most of the time, I was happy to color away, reading Laurie's book as the pages came in. During the course of this last year, Laurie and I traded daily e-mails often times discussing men- "He said what?!" or the election -Yay! Obama! or any number of random thoughts. It was fun. We met a couple times for coffee, here in Los Angeles, when she'd flown in to interview some über famous celeb. It was a strange and awesome experience getting to know someone like that. There were times I felt challenged by this assignment too. There was so much to do that there was very little time for working on my own art or for making any extra money either. But new pages of the book would arrive with e-mails coinciding and I'd get another glimpse at the story unfolding before me. I could relate to so much she shared about herself in both her book and correspondence...even though our lives are vastly different. And let's face it, because the woman is a very good interviewer, I pretty much told her my whole story too. I think I felt comfortable blabbing about myself to her because I was witnessing how she was willing to put herself out there to tell her own story. I have a great amount of respect for that. So please check out this book! Check out her book readings if you're in either NYC, Los Angeles, San Fran or Portland in August. It's an honest, entertaining, humorous, and compelling read. You might find a bit of yourself in there too. And, if I don't say so myself....it's color ain't too shabby. ;) www.lauriesandell.com Hi! So, Liberty Porter, First Daughter came out this week. I illustrated the cover and interiors. I must say, it was pretty cool to go into Barnes and Noble and see the book on the shelf...not far away from a few of the other covers I've done over the past couple years. Wow, it's like I'm a true blue illustrator or something! Wooo Hoo! I bought two of the three copies (one for me and the other for my parents) but still, had to leave the third copy there so my Mom could go into that store and see it for herself. Look Ma, it's really there on the shelf! Read fun facts from the author about Liberty Porter and other First Kids here ! Here are a few of the interior illustrations! This Young Reader Chapter Book was written by Julia DeVillers , published by Simon & Schuster, book design by Karin Paprocki. Available in hardback, everywhere!
Right now a baby is crying. A mammy is singing. A boy is climbing a tree. Back then a bunch o’ country chil’dren with no tee vee used to play Right Now, swinging in the hammock, in the wood verandah overlooking the solitary road from country to town. Then li’l Cousin Tar would insist on telling he saga of Electric Head, a light bulb. Electric Head jump off the ceiling, walk down them steps and he is the only light bulb that ever turn into a war tank. Yawn and yawn and yawn this story would go and we useta listen with politeness ‘til somebody holla. ‘Til we get lost in a Big People maze of tasks, and panic set in. Stop, stop, play Right Now ... Right now , a spot on me bed sheet, where one pillow does lay, is soakin’ wet because I unplug the iron, leave it on the mattress, it plups down in me absence and the water that does make steam leak out, now, sheet and pillow cases is in the bathroom, I lie crossways on the bed and listen to radio. What do you want from me, curtain is coolin’ the sky-fever from me room, a light wind is hustling the cloud-herd to somewhere west, guava and fresh dirt fragrance rise up to meet me, I am pink, mellowing. Now is the time to take the time to get outta the maze, hear, see, feel, right now, for a while. Radio is boring, lemme play a li’l bit o’ Bob, Love to see when ya move in the rhythm; I love to see, when you're dancin' from within... To get awards from fellow bloggers is like getting a box of perfect chocolates - smooth and meltin' - like the best kinda flattery. But I got this secret confession...for some time, I been shaky about this blog, and when I get a’ award, I wonder if I really deserve them good things that people say. I wonder if I can live up to them praise. And that is why I procrastinate over mentioning one from fat juicy oyster , a ‘specially juicy blog by Ieishah. I does have to wait ‘til I have puh-lenty time to read, because she write about something I used to dream of doing...travel around the world, Europe, work. As she say, “have sass. will travel.” Then, recently, I receive another award, this time from Cloudcutter in Mumbai . I been reading Cloud since long-time passing. She does write about love, breakup, memories, Mumbai; she does reflect on humanity, we habits. Sometimes, she does make me think how India produce some amazing writers of books and movies. I realise then that, if two people I admire give me these delicious blog chocolates, I must, as me Auntie Baba tell me when I was a young girl, learn to accept with grace. So here me is, saying, thank you Ieishah, for this : And thank you Cloud, for this : Now, to be a copycat like Pat (that rhyme, you notice? It rhyme, I’s a poet), I gon stitch them two together and write 10 honest t’ings you mightn’t know about me: 1. I miss hiking up mountain trails. I miss the heat from chugging up, and the wind cooling down sweat. I miss that wild, free feeling, reaching the top. Mountains in Guyana is in the interior, you can’t just hike and go home at the end of the day. Plus, it expensive to get there. 2. I crave beauty like lonely people crave love. I want flowers all over the coastland, I don’t want me eyes to settle on one single plastic bottle hunkering in the long grass like some modern version of a flower. I want to see trees lining every single street, shading people, cars, donkeys and horses. Fruit trees would be good so that hungry people can pick and eat. 3. I ain’t got no friends in Guyana, everybody migrate, Cousin Yasmeen die. I must go out and look for more but where to start? 4. Me guitar is gently weepin’, beggin’ me to play it. Or maybe it secretly rejoicin’, thinkin’, phew, no more bad strummin’. 5. Favourite colour is red. If I did live in cold country, I would have a red coat. 6. If I was rich-rich, rich-rich-rich, I would wear haute couture. But normally, I wear any ol' thing. 7. If I was rich-rich, rich-rich-rich, I would sponsor plenty children, pay their school fees, buy umbrella and raincoat for them in the rainy season, but with the way El Nino behaving, umbrella and raincoat mightn’t be necessary. 8. I understand magazines like Harvard Business Review and The Economist but I can’t understand some of we newspapers…yesterday I read one sentence in a local newspaper, it was a paragraph long. 9. I don’t like hurting people but I end up doing it sometimes, without meaning to or wanting to. Then I feel bad about it forever. 10. Two Brazilian gals comin’ at eight to buy a li’l bit o’ English so I better skedaddle outta here…………………….. My thoughts is a pack of traitors. They always lead me to every confusion but the right one. Like today, for example. Today, I go out into the white sunshine, stand at the top of them back steps, to heng out some clothes to dry. Thick, sweet grass smell fill the air. I sniff, yes, it is that leaf that them Indian immigrants did bring to the Windies long ago, the weed that Rasta people think does kerry them to I-nitation , mediation on another level. Continue to heng out the clothes, can’t let that neighbour see me sniffing the air. Whip the towel like my mother say I should, snap it hard to let out the water, sniff the air, man, I am positive it is that thing , after all, that chap, what work he does do? Every now and then he does disappear off to goodness knows where. Aw, darn, I drop a skirt, oh, good, it is hanging on the pipeline just under the step. I tom-boy meself over the step rail, on to the shed, pick up the skirt, shees, that thing smell so strong, it gon make me giddy, I gon fall off this shed this good day, today... ...I wonder if I should rinse this skirt, nah man, it is clean, besides, this blazing heat gon kill every germ... ...pishewww...the pressure-cooker in the kitchen holler, oh skegs , wait a minute, I wonder if it is the lentil peas smelling so... ...heh. This confusion ain’t quarter as mix-up as the confusion about the rat poo in me tea. I gon never forget that tea though it was some years gone. How that tea taste nice. How that tea taste spicy and milky and just plain, all-over delicious, like warm, liquid bliss, from me tongue to me toes, pulling down me eyelids. I drain the cup. I look inside hoping for one last drop. At the bottom of the cup, there it is, the lump, plump and brown, thin at the two ends and thick in the middle. I cuss the sugar-factory because, as we know, that thing coulda only come from there. I cuss the people of Guyana. Because, as we know, it is only in Guyana that this can happen, thanks to people who don’t do their work with care. I cuss the guvament, never mind they don’t work the factory. I don’t know how I live without suffering from hypochondria that evening. Months pass. Memory dim. I make cardamom tea again. I bust open the pod and put the whole lump of seed in it. How that tea taste nice. How that tea taste spicy and milky and just plain, all-over delicious, like warm, liquid bliss, from me tongue to me toes, pulling down me eyelids. I drain the cup. I look inside hoping for one last drop but all I did see was déjà-vu. I cuss...oh, heh...it ain’t rat-poo, is cardamom seed. Memory return, remind me that the seed look very much like the one in that cup some months before. Maybe, my thoughts...not me...my thoughts...is a pack o’ drama queens, that's wot. Or maybe what they see is what it ain't. I need a cuppa sweet, milky cardammon chai. One day, in the not so far future, spam gon be the new dutty , stinkin’ word. Think of all the ways people does use the old four-letter word...spam gon be like that. People gon shout things like, “Spam you, man,” and the recipient of such a cuss gon launch he or she self at the abuser in rage. After the calm, the storm. And during the storm? What? What does happen during the storm? Some people does cower then suddenly they rise up and bruk through like Samson brukking up stone. Then you have some who, during the storm, don't cower at all. You stand up, move around, do what you must do. But as soon as that storm pass, you fall to the ground, dry-up like thirsty leaf. Anxiety and fear jook like sharp plimpla as you try to make your way out of them thorns. You feel tempted to hide in a cool, dark place, to curl up with your worries so you can recreate the storm, because the storm is from the past, and though the past lash you hard like devil weeing on you, it is the devil that you know; it is the devil that you’s most comfortable with. The future, because you can’t sense it, feel worse. But maybe you truly hate the ol’ bruk-a-down rubble. So you pick up your dowsing rod and you go ‘til ping, like instinct, you find something. You grab your li’l shovel, fix your feet firmly on the ground and you dig. Dig, fumble, stumble, dig. And before you know it, you’s creating a fresh new place. In other words, to be precise and concise, after I receive sad or shocking blows, I does cope. Then, when I start to recover, I does become scared and anxious. The temptation to curl up with them worries does be strong. But I know that this ain’t a flourishing thing to do, I know I should get going. I must keep going ‘til I feel like the water-melon that been in we veranda all Friday afternoon, into the night and on Saturday morning, sitting in the white basket-chair, taking sea-breeze, grinning. Heh. “Last year was a hard year for we,” cousin Yasmeen say a few Saturdays ago. Yes, it was, after she first big brother die mid-last year. I did grieve for she and she family. I did grieve especially for she mammy, my Auntie M. who does dispense tea, biscuit and jam and slather everything with humour in a breezy home, where pigeons coo in the rafters, the wind go wheeerrreee and, one time, carpenters did find baby owls in the roof. Cousin Yasmeen did proper love them baby owls, the same way she used to love them poor li'l chil'ren . “A parent should never have to bury a child,” mammy did say last year after we get the news about Auntie M. big son. Mammy been at the ol’ pink kitchen table, quoting a father in a movie. The father been sitting with one hand resting on a’ upright knee, talking to a friend. “There should be an order to things. First, the parent grows old and dies. A parent should never have to bury a child.” Last Friday, Auntie M. bury she youngest daughter, me cousin Yasmeen, me friend and laughing companion. Shucks boy, if Shamwow come here, it gon sell like rum on a Friday night after people see this Guyana-talk version . Heh. I bet it can clean up the whole o’ Georgetown city. Translated into pure, raw, unadulterated Creolese: Shucks bai, if Shamwow come hey, ee go sell like dharoo pan a Friday night after people see dis ting hey . Heh. me bet ee cyan clean up de whole ah Gargetung. To believe this theory, you got to open your mind to the possibility of other things. You can’t be like a certain person who laugh when I phone he the other night to tell he that I solve the UFO mystery. “I think UFOs is jinns,” I announce. Certain person laugh like kookaburra sitting in the ol’ gum tree, wooo hoo hahahahaHAAA. But I’s never daunted by such trifling things. I take a deep breath, haul out me soapbox, leap on to it. That night, it was a pink soapbox. I been in a mellow mood because I know that my theory gon catch on, and soon, even them Doubting Thomases gon latch on to it. “You see? You see?” I pronounce. “That is the western mind for you. Western people can believe in anything they want to believe in, even if they don’t have scientific evidence. But when it comes to Eastern beliefs, the western mind scoffs. How do you know that jinns don’t exist? If people can believe that UFOs exist, then why not jinns? They do exist. Other worlds exist. Other beings exist, we don’t see them. Jinns are made of smokeless fire, they carry on a full-scale life just like human beings, we just can’t see them. Maybe they fly in spaceships too, we just don’t know.” He mouth get li’l , as we does say when somebody can’t argue with one more word. Heh. I even get a email congratulating me. I ignore the last line as ol’ fashion jealousy. “where nasa and the usaf and the raf have failed for decades, i send you my congratulations on your solving the UFO mystery. but, it is worth keeping in mind that throughout the ages seers have not generally been well treated for revealing truths. so, if you feel you can withstand the onslaught from those with vested interests, go ahead, reveal the truth. also, prepare yourself for unexpected things like nominations for an ig-nobel prize.”
You know when you are waiting for something, and you just want to get it over with.  The line for the roller coaster makes your stomach drop almost as much as the ride... if its your first time (or so you think). I knew it would and the anticipation was killing me, and every bit of me didn't want it to come, but at the same time, I just wanted to get that first time over with ... you know? This morning, it happened.  The first bomb went off in relatively close proximity to our new house.  At 6:30am, the house was rocked with an explosive boom, followed by that noise I always hear small boys make when holding their toy guns (I'm impressed how accurate they are). However, like somethings you are unsure of, like small earthquake tremors or when you think you hear someone in the house ... this was not one of them, this was a boom that shook the city, followed by two smaller booms and automatic firing.

In class today we were discussing an article which brought up the topic of "Reinforcement or Motivation." Of course, it was in relation to what extent we, as Speech-language clinicians, should reinforce good behaviour in our child clients or whether we should let intrinsic motivation guide their behavior. We defined reinforcement as anything external to the child, such as giving stickers, and motivation being the child's own reasons for learning. In one study there was a group of children were told that they would be given a prize when they finished a drawing activity, there was another group of kids that didn't know they would get a reward until the end of the activity, and one group who received no prize at all. The study showed that the children initially told that they would receive a prize for their drawing were drawing less in the classroom afterwards and that drawing became an instrumental means to receive an award. Overall, these types of studies have shown that "rewards have a significant negative effect on intrinsic motivation." I got to thinking about this and its application to my experiences with choral music and I feel that my intrinsic motivation to sing is really what drives my passion. I always find that whenever I am offered money to sing... my relationship with the music changes. It no longer is a passion for me since performing the music is just another job. Of course, I would be lying to say I didn't enjoy the fact that I get paid for gigs occasionally; however, I can't honestly say that my most musically fulfilling experiences occurred when I was paid to sing. I understand that performing is part of an artists' livelihood, but do we ever reach a point where we are just doing another job and we're not being musically satisfied anymore? I know many musicians are possibly reading this and I would love to get their input on this matter. Therefore, dear readers, what are your thoughts? Does internal motivation guide your happiness or do you feel like monetary reinforcement plays a role in shaping your happiness response as well? It doesn't even have to be choral or music related since I find this is a topic applicable to all areas. I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below! Greetings! I must say that last night's Broadway Gala was extremely fun and definitely the least stressful Gala I have ever experienced. I think it was due in part to the fact that Belle Canto didn't have too many numbers so I wasn't doing rapid-fire costume changes in the wings of the stage and I actually had time to just hang out in the green room and watch the other performances. However, it did feel strange to be so idle when there was still so much backstage chaos going on. The first half of the evening were song selections revolving around the theme of "Family" from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, The Sound of Music, Gypsy, Anne of Green Gables, White Christmas, and Cinderella and the second half were songs from The Fiddler on the Roof. I have to get it out now, I must say a special thanks for the amazing men's chorus this year! It's staggering to think that these men return year after year to help us out with the Broadway Gala given the amount of work they have to go through every year. They definitely had a lot of work in store for them this year with the male chorus demands in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Fiddler on the Roof. You may wonder how a treble-centric choral program manages to find men but it is all through the connections of our choristers. Fathers, husbands, brothers, friends, random strangers---these men comprise our male chorus. The only unfortunate thing this year was that Belle Canto and the Men's Chorus didn't have any duet numbers since I only have fond memories of knocking on coconut bras of the men from last year's South Pacific. I watched the first half of the concert from the Green Room t.v. so it was hard for me to hear exactly everything that was going on but it seemed like everything appeared to run smoothly. The "Goin' Courtin'" song from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was extremely cute when 2 Belle Canto lasses were showing the proper courting ways for the socially unrefined brothers. There was a point where each of the men took turns two-stepping with the gals and it was hilarious to watch their purposefully off-beat dance steps as they tossed the ladies around. The numbers from Anne of Green Gables, Cinderella, and Gypsy were mainly small group or solo numbers and they all were carried off wonderfully from soloists from the choir. I do have to say, and I am not alone in this, that the highlight of the first half was definitely the songs from the Sound of Music and specifically the lovely little Mia, playing Gretel in "So Long, Farewell." The unphased little Mia sat in the middle of the stage all by herself and sang the solo line with confidence and charm. I watched from the backstage t.v.'s and my friend, Nicole, put it very well in saying that the performance was so gutwrenchingly cute that her ovaries felt it. The second half with Fiddler on the Roof brought all the choirs on stage for the mass numbers, and I must admit, I was winging it for a few of the pieces. Due to the fact that I was in Montreal for most of the week and missed out on 3 of the large rehearsals, I was definitely lagging behind in choreography precision. I knew my steps for the solo Belle Canto numbers such as for "Sister's" and "The Dream" from Fiddler but everything else was new to me. I appreciated the help of my fellow choristers tweaking my movements in Fiddler during the dress rehearsal (which was right before the performance) and I just watched others for the cues in Sabbath Prayer, Anatevka, and Sunrise Sunset. Also, thanks to Amy from Belle Canto for gathering up some Belle's to run through "Sisters" with me backstage. Sure, it wasn't my best Broadway Gala performance to date but I had fun and I know my slight mishaps didn't ruin the show. The most challenging was "The Dream," and it wasn't due to the fact that I didn't know what I was doing movement-wise, but lining up words with an improvised piano part was not easy. Especially when we needed to get notes from piano.... However, I am not here to dwell on the negative. It was an extremely fun performance overall and I must give kudos to Steven who played Tevye for many of the Fiddler songs. Maybe it just worked out that he's the husband of our choir conductor but we managed to maximize on his talent in the past few years. He played the she-male, Edna, from Hairspray last year, and his comedic flaire for Tevye was spot on this year. Plus, it makes me smile to think of how he is a Geology academic by day but a community Broadway star by night :) Overall, our 9th Broadway Gala was a success in my eyes minus some small missteps, missed notes, and funky piano improv on some of the songs. It's a bit of a chaotic production every year but I wouldn't have it any other way :) Enjoy some of the pictures from the evening! The men's chorus in Fiddler on the Roof Photo Credit: Stephen L.

Touching up makeup backstage An array of costumes from the evening Relaxing in the Green Room A cozy self-portrait My dress for the sisters number. I originally brought a black dress (since I wasn't sure on what the costume verdit was as I kept on getting continuous e-mails from people changing their mind while I was away in Montreal) but I noticed that lots of people had color dresses on during the dress rehearsal. Due to the fact that our choreographer, Adam, said he was more focused on looking at people's dresses, I figured another black dress wasn't the most simulating so I called my mom to bring this dress that has been sitting in my closet for a while. Sometimes I feel sorry for my pretty clothing pieces that never get to be worn so I'm glad this dress was able to have a night out. I believed it all worked out well and you can probably tell from the first photo in this post that the color pops a lot better than black.

I met Leanne at the McGill Schulich School of Music around noon after her morning practising. We headed off to Simons yet again for some shopping but then ended over in the hip Plateau area on St. Laurent street for lunch. At the advice of Jeremy, we went over to Cafe Santropol for their delicious sandwiches. In my mind I was expecting a bakery-like place that served sandwiches on the side but the exter ior of this restaurant looked like an ordinary house. Indeed, inside the restaurant was a home-turned-restaurant and we grabbed a table in the sun-room at the back of the house. There was a cute patio outside which I can only imagine is very lovely in the summertime. The sandwiches were made on their signature Cafe Santropol bread and Leanne postulated that molasses was the secret ingredient to give the bread its rich color. There were so many delicious sandwich options but I ended up settling on one with smoked ham with apple and mint jelly. It was so refreshing and light! I can't wait to go back next time and try their other inventive sandwich options. After lunch we did some vintage shopping on St. Laurent and one of the highlights was walking into a store where the sales girl looked like she walked out of the 50s era with her red lips, jet-black tied back into a chic roll, thick-framed glasses and vibrant cropped sweater. The store was full of hidden gems with showcases full of cat-rimmed glasses, shelves with evening clutches from the 1960s and hanging displays of vintage brass broaches. I appreciated the fact that this vintage store was extremely non-junky since it's no fun to go vintage shopping and you're sniffling because everything is dusty and old. It started snowing and getting chilly near the end of our shopping trip so we headed back to Leanne's place to start on dinner for the evening. She made a delicious vegetarian casserole and baked vegan chocolate brownies for dessert. Again, we topped off the evening by viewing multiple episodes of GLEE as well as watching the Olympics men's hockey shootout between Canada and Sweden. Exciting times! Now, I am back in Edmonton and getting myself organized for the Cantilon Broadway Gala I'll be performing at tomorrow. If you're in the Edmonton/St. Albert area, you should come check out the show! Location: Arden Theatre St. Albert, AB Time: 7:30 pm Tickets: $30 Adult, $15 Student I fear this blog is venturing far away from the realm of choral music, oh well, I'm taking a break from school so the subject matter is taking a break from choral singing as well. Today Leanne and I headed off to try lunch at The Sparrow . If I thought Reservoir was amazing yesterday, the Sparrow is equal if not better. I was assured everything on the menu was delicious and it was. The restaurant is run by a chef who worked under Gordon Ramsay in London and the Sparrow embraces " gastropub " food. Thus, uniting liquor and delicious eats to go along with it. I also heard they have a killer brunch... too bad I'm not here until the weekend! The restaurant design was also quaint and cute with a lovely sparrow patterned wallpaper on one side of the restaurant. Afterward, Leanne and I ventured off to find Fairmont Bagels where she picked up many delicious hand-rolled bagels. We walked down St. Denis and did some shopping and when we parted ways, where she headed off to rehearsal, I took a break from walking in the cold and went to go get some hot chocolate at Juliette et Chocolat . I remember last time I visited Juliette et Chocolat I had a bit too much chocolate and had an intense sugar buzz afterwards. This is because their hot chocolate isn't some watered-down powder mix. You're drinking actual melted chocolate mixed with cream. This time I didn't overdose and the experience was much more enjoyable. I just sat there, drinking liquid chocolate gold and eating a sundae topped with brownies, strawberries, bananas and chocolate fondue sauce while reading the online news from my cell phone. After this I did some more shopping in the area before meeting back up with Leanne after her Contemporary Music Ensemble rehearsal at McGill . Leanne was famished so we went to find La Banquise for some delicious Montreal poutine . This restaurant is 24h and I have fond memories of its greasy and satisfying dishes. My friend and I searched for this restaurant by walking uphill on icy streets with killer windchill and I remember the sweet, warm, smell of victory when the aroma of freshly fried food was in the air. La Banquise was a greasy comfort-food haven for us and it has not changed. I opted for the Poutine Dan Dan this time where crispy fries were topped off with pepperoni, bacon, onions and cheese all smothered in gravy. Greasy heart-attack inducing food never tasted so good! We headed back to her apartment and enjoyed viewing "Chickasaw" a musical DVD gifted to me by Donald Patriquin yesterday. I also topped off that viewing by introducing Leanne to GLEE and we watched the pilot together. How I love that show! Just one more day in the city! I am traveling away in Montreal and I have a few highlighted snapshots to show for it :) Started out in Verdun, QC walking from Leanne and Jeremy's apartment to the metro Heading up to the Plateau area to have lunch at Reservoir (a restaurant recommended to me by my sister). So delicious! The restaurant had a laid-back vibe but the food is gourmet in a non-pretentious way. The menu was all in French on a chalkboard and I ordered something where I recognized the words "salmon and apple" but I wasn't wholly sure of what the dish was. However, I did find out it was a pan fried salmon which was topped off with deep fried sweet onions on a baked slice of apple. I know it sounds like a strange combination but it was so inventive and appetizing. I have never tasted anything in my life like it!. To top it off I got warm crusty bread to go along with my latte! Then I was off to a concert at St. James United Church to see Leanne play in her string trio. In between waiting for busses to arrive and dodging hobos at church entrances I couldn't get into I, unfortunately, was late and missed their piece since they were first in the program. But I did catch the other performers and they sounded great. The church was also a really nice venue for music. After the concert I met up with Canadian composer, Donald Patriquin , and chatted about music over sushi. What an excellent combination! We did a gift swap at the end where I passed along some music from the Cantilon Chamber Choir and he shared a DVD with a musical he wrote music and directed call "Chickasaw." He also gave me a reusable bag with a Nietzsche quote in French "Life without music is an error" to bring a hopeful reminder that I made the right choice about not going on the choir tour after reading my post: Choral Apathy . Then I was off to St. Catherine's for shopping! I raided of Simons thoroughly and afterward I gawked at beautiful things I can't afford at Ogilvy's . Since I had time, I went to Schwartz for a smoked Montreal meat sandwich. I was told that I HAD to eat here and after dodging the hobo outside the door (lots of hobo run-in's today) I enjoyed a deli sandwich at the counter. It was delicious but there was just SO much meat. I couldn't even see the bread! I had to divide what I thought was the midway point of the sandwich and eat 4 separate pieces with a fork and knife. It's very much a eat-and-go restaurant, since there's always a line-up, but I think it would be a much more relaxing dining experience if I went back with some more people next time. Then I took the bus back to the McGill area and had a chai latte at Art Java . It was nice to just sit down and read the McGill student newspaper. Olympic news was also on the t.v. so I enjoyed how people were in Stanley Park golfing since the weather was so nice and warm for the Olympics. It was also just nice to be near other students, even though they we
e all there cramming for exams and finishing up their papers before their reading week, which happens to be a next week. After meeting up with Leanne we came back to her place and baked chai spice cookies from scratch and had a craft evening where we made cards. What a fantastic way to unwind after a very productive day! Because I believe in sharing delicious things, here's the recipe to make your own chai spice cookies! Credit to Lilian, Leanne's friend! Chai-Spiced Cookies Makes about 30 cookies Fragrant with the classic flavors of chai tea, these buttery, crumbly cookies are perfect for dunking in a cup of tea of coffee. Ingredients 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted Method Preheat oven to 350°F. Beat butter with granulated sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl until well blended. Stir in flour, spices and salt until just combined. Scoop and roll dough into small teaspoon-sized balls and place about an inch apart on parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Bake until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Roll warm cookies in powdered sugar and let cool completely on a rack. Store in an airtight container. It is high time for a break! More specifically, a reading week break! A full week without early morning classes, assignments and major commitments! Is it sad to say I've been waiting for this since the beginning of January? Anyway, my reading week break will be filled with the following activities: Heading to Montreal to visit my dear friend, Leanne, whom I sang with in Con Fuoco and Jeremy, her lovely husband Meet up with Canadian composer, Donald Patriquin , for a tour of the McGill music department-yay for connecting with awesome music people though blog comments! Shop at Simons -yes, this is totally unrelated to music or choir... but I'm still a girl... and girls shop when they travel :) Drinking hot chocolate and eating copious amounts of Montreal deli sandwiches Coming back home to perform in the Cantilon Broadway Gala's performance of Fiddler on the Roof I'll be back just in time for the Broadway Gala performance. If you read my post on it last year , you can bet it'll be a fun evening indeed. We do the dress rehearsal that afternoon and the performance that evening. I'm missing all of the blocking rehearsals next week leading up to the performance, but thankfully, we blocked Belle Canto's main numbers and for the other group pieces I can easily assimilate myself into the background. I know my notes and words so I'm not worried. Take care and stay warm (for those in chilly climates like mine!) I'll definitely be blogging when I'm in Montreal next week so stay tuned! I have put off writing this post for a while because, frankly, it kills me to be talking about it. For as long as I have been in choir, I have enjoyed the perks of being in a choir from free food to the chance to tour amazing places. In the beginning years of the Chamber Choir , my first tour was to Regina SK, after that was Vancouver BC, following that was my first international tour where we went to Wales for the Llangollen Music Festival , then there was a mini choir exchange tour to Toronto ON. Next, I was off on my next large international trip: Hungary, Vienna, and Prague for the Bela Bartok Festival . Then I had a few years break but I still had the chance to go on a mini trip to Victoria B.C. for a day to sing at a music conference. However, after a few years in Belle Canto , we were off to Cork Ireland to compete in the Cork International Choral Festival ! Then I was extremely lucky to be able to return to Cork the following year because the University of Alberta Madrigal singers entered the same festival as well! Yes, I have been extremely lucky to travel to so many places. Yes, I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to sing in amazing venues. Yes, touring is a luxury and I have been given an experience that some people will never be exposed to. It still hurts though. Since I haven't explained myself very well "it" refers to the fact that Belle Canto is off to compete in the Seghizzi Choral Festival in Italy this July... and I'm not going. This is the first time that I have been left out of a choir tour. Don't get me wrong, it has nothing to do with the choir, I know they would all be happy to have me there, but it's the first time where "life" has interfered with my choral passions. The reason I will not be able to head off to Italy and have wonderful choral adventures is that my Masters program is packed with clinic and courses that I need to complete, which, coincidentally, runs until the end of July. For a few months in the summer last year, after accepting my place in the program, I toyed with the idea of going to Italy.... maybe even just for the weekend! Show up, compete in the classes, and then head back to Canada without missing on any major coursework or clinic time! My mind buzzed with this possibility! Maybe it was possible to have the best of both worlds??? Alas, the stress of not knowing what I would be missing until July arrived and by that point already having my tickets booked just didn't cut it for me. Also, I usually extend my trip and travel after the competition (since I'm already over there) but a 3-day weekend blitz would not really allow for that. I had to make a decision... and school won out. However, I have to admit that when I received my acceptance call from the University, after the initial shock from that message died down, the FIRST thing that popped into my head was: "That means I can't go to Italy." :( For a second I felt like declining my Masters acceptance! I realize that may sound a bit sick to some of you readers. Clearly, I did not act on this natural choral reflex of mine (my parents would have probably slaughtered me after first giving me a raging lecture on how I shamed them and all their efforts to raise me). I have slowly come to terms with the fact that I won't be able to go, trying to find trivial details to make me feel better like "That means I don't have to fundraise like crazy this year! Whoot $2500 saved!", "Nobody knows where Seghizzi is anyway!", and "The performance venue doesn't look that nice". All in attempt to placate my silently suffering self. I have never been through such a bout of choral apathy. It is a deadly thing. It's the crippling unmotivation that is getting me. I feel like I have nothing to work towards this year. Why should I memorize that piece? I won't be able to sing it anyway. Why should I go to that performance? I don't need performance experience anyway. Maybe it's even better for me not to sing since I'm just throwing off the group balance that actually will be touring. I've always known it's important to have a common goal in choir, whether it is for a particular concert or competition, but once that end goal is no longer in sight, it's hard to motivate yourself to continue what you're doing. We all need something to drive us and inspire us to be better. When that stimulus is gone... we're directionless. Meanwhile, I am excited that my choir is going and watching them buzz over the amazing experiences to come! I get to hear about their travel plans and the amazing gigs they are lining up for themselves, such as singing in St. Mark's Cathedral for Sunday service in Venice! However, I can find myself detaching from it since I find it hurts less. The less I know about their wonderful tour plans the less I know about the things I am missing out on. It's not a great strategy but it's the one I'm currently employing. Silent detachment with a hint of grin-and-bear-it. I suppose it would be easier if I could blame this on something. Blame it on the choir for not wanting me there! That's not the case. Blame it on my passion-consuming program! Which is not the case (for the most part). Blame it all on me! Even though I know I made right choice since there wasn't really a choice. All I can do is wish them the best. Cheer them on while they're overseas competing. Hope they bring back a 1st place standing so I can bask in the glory as well, because, hey, even though I'm not standing on the same stage as them in Italy doesn't mean I'm not still a part of the choir :) Oh, and for any of my fellow choristers reading this post, I also wouldn't say no to them bringing home a handsome Swedish choir boy for me :) In the meantime, take care readers, I hope this wasn't too much of a oh-woe-is-me blog post! I really do wish my choir the best and you can bet I'll be singing with them up until the day they leave on that plane to Italy! Oops! I can't believe I missed the one year anniversary of my blog! To think that January 19, 2009 is when it all began... Though I can't say that blogging has forever changed my life, it definitely made my past year much more interesting. As well, it's a very therapeutic way to express my musical thoughts and meet awesome readers! I was able to try my hand at electromusic composition a year ago and I posted lots of fun sound clips of my work for you all to listen to and documented my musical project progress along the way. Blogging also gave me some amazing opportunities to attend and review excellent concerts put on by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra such as Carmina Burana and the Symphony Under the Sky Festival in Hawrelak park. It was also an exciting time when I was the blog of note for August 20, 2009 and I had hundreds of visitors checking out my page! It was overwhelming to get that amount of traffic but it was so exciting to hear from people around the world who had the same choral passions as I. I like to think that I was able to post a wide array of entries such as the evolution of choral uniforms to more thoughtful entries documenting my choral involvement such as my first time out at camp and my first choir rehearsal . I also hoped that you have enjoyed some of my choral tidbits for success such as faking confidence and having a successful candlelight procession :) Overall, I just want to say thanks to all my readers for actually reading what I have to say! It's staggering to think that people actually want to read my choral thoughts! I've really tried to write my entries in an engaging way since I do believe that there are still people not completely sold on the idea of choral music. It probably doesn't help that one the only times choral music makes it way into mainstream media is when there are booming adult voices singing ominous choruses at a climactic film moment. I'm thinking of the two-on-one lighttsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul at the end of Star Wars Episode I. As stimulating as the Duel of the Fates battle sequence was, choral music is so much more than loud chorus singing! Choir is such a dynamic and engaging way to unify individual voices to create an amazing acoustic texture. No choir sounds the same because no choir has the same singers. Every voice has a unique role within a choir and that results in the enjoyment of singing as well as the challenges that choirs face. While I probably don't need to change your mind per say, since you probably have been following my posts due to a personal interest in choral singing, there are still so many more people out who need to experience the addiction that is choir. However, if you, dear reader, are not a chorister but still enjoy my posts... I feel like I have done my job. Take care and talk soon!
I may be the only person in the entire Middle East who routinely wears a Reds cap and t-shirt.  That being said, there is no shortage of folks wearing Bankee$ and Bread $ox gear.  In fact, the guy sitting right next to me is wearing the big red B on his head right now.I walked by a shoe shop the other day and there was a massive display of Bankee$ footwear in the window.  I'm talking the whole window, men's, women's, and children's shoes, all with the infamous NY Bankee$ logo stitched all over the place.Ugh.  Really?  Is that the best baseball can do?  Pollute the already troubled Middle East with the stamp of imperialism?  Isn't that NY the epitome of the economic system which has so incensed the have nots that they have taken up arms to defeat it?I have to do that Reds cap thing Jamey Ramsey does on his blog.  I'll get someone to take my photo in my Reds cap in front of some bombed out building or something.
Right now, I am staring out at the Mediterranean from an office window.  It's warm, very warm, and the horizon stretches to infinity as it is prone to do over large bodies of water (very cold water, as I learned last weekend.)  I seem to have everything here - beaches, snow-capped mountains, mounds of hummus and tabouleh, freshly squeezed orange juice, palm trees, a bar where I can drink as much as I want for about $13...but I have this insatiable hunger for something I cannot have.  I want to watch a Reds game, almost to the point of desperation.  Yes, it is February,and no matter where on Earth I am, the hunger arises at the same time every year.I had a dream last night that I was sitting in a ballpark, in all of its infinite green, and I could almost smell that hotdogs and hear the pop of a pitch hitting a mitt.  Nothing like it, that pop. As I sit here now, I can almost hear the humming sound of a fastball tearing through the air, and then...pop!  Such a beautiful song.
I attended this wedding created by the beautiful and talented bride and surrounded by her very generous and creative family. Never have I seen a more beautiful wedding, let alone attended one. It was an honour to be there. We found ourselves breathless at the beauty of it. I spent the weekend in Mudgee (c ountry NSW) a land of rolling green hills wearing uniforms of vines and trees of olives backed by rugged mountains. We finally stopped for lunch after getting lost in the rain for an hour trying to find the restaurant (which funnily enough is named Solitary) because we packed and took off without a single map or address. Plain arrogance I think it was. There we were, thinking we were going to quiet country towns and assuming the places we were headed should be obvious because, well, surely there was little else around. Wrong on the lunch front and wrong again when we tried to find the guest house. We did our research on the scene of the ceremony though because we didn't want to miss a minute - when I show you the wedding, you'll understand why. I have been meaning to tell you how flattered I was when my heavy headed rose postcards (hanging in the top right hand corner) were featured in a beautiful NZ magazine in their Feb/Mar 10 issue which came out on Australia Day featuring these sweet Valentines Day gift ideas. I tend to like the behind the scenes bits best. The part when it all comes together and there are no people there to add unwanted colours and mess to the vision. Just artisans - florists, cake decorators, event designers - working as a team. The only guests pre-party are lovers of colour and create-as-you-go constructionists, and hopefully some strong men to help carry the 'stuff'. Stunning board by super talented Elena . Spot my pic top middle. More 'Things I love Thursday' on her truly gorgeous blog . Flowers enjoyed at night with tea and chocolate and dreams of faraway places. Sugarcoated created the most amazing wedding. Watch their blog over the next few weeks for all the stunning details.
Meet the newest member of my knitting group, Josephine! She must have been so eager to get in on the fibery fun that she decided to arrive early. About 7 weeks early. Now that she's out of the NICU, she's thriving, eating and sleeping and growing like crazy to catch up. Everyone played "pass the baby" the minute she showed up. Squeeeee! ...fly away home. And she did! To my home, that is. My Schacht Ladybug spinning wheel that was my Christmas present arrived near the end of January -- some delay at the factory -- and now we are at the dawning of a new fiber obsession. She came via Woodland Woolworks, which also sent a kit with oil, orifice hook (there must be a better name -- sounds like a medieval torture device), and a pound of fiber, labeled Falkland Top from Argentina. I also ordered a tensioned Lazy Kate that integrates into the frame -- and talk about terrific customer service, I had that Lazy Kate within a week of ordering. So here's what I started with: a pound of undyed wool top, ready for spinning: A friend in the local spinning guild invited me to an open spin-in and got me started, whereupon I worked up a couple of bobbins full of somewhat wobbly singles: Once I had two full bobbins, I took the third and started plying, figuring that out from pictures in books and on the web: And once the first bobbin of plied yarn was full, I stopped at the yarn shop on the way home from work and said, "I need a niddy-noddy, which is not easy to say at the end of a long day!" (Need a niddy noddy.... nod a needy-niddy... nid a noddy-needy...) After I had the first yarn skeined, I washed it in Soak, squeezed out the water, whacked it a few times to fluff it up, and hung it up to dry: And voila! Yarn! Okay, so I have some tension issues and plying issues to work out. But you have to start somewhere. After all, no one sits down to the piano for the first time and plays Chopin perfectly -- and no one sits down at the piano thinking they're going to butcher Chopin on purpose, either. Practice, practice, practice, that's how you get to Carnegie Hall as the old joke goes. And that's how the yarn gets better and better. That's the first 8 ounces of the pound of fiber. Now on to the second half, where I can see my singles are already starting to get a little more even. Aaaand we're done! My third and last project for the 2010 Ravelympics project crossed the finish line last night, a Ripple Cowl done in Plymouth Baby Bunny and finished with vintage pearly plastic buttons. The yarn is listed as a worsted, but I found it knits up more like a DK. I cast on using size 5 needles and followed the directions in the pattern, resulting in a smaller, closer-fitting cowl. It's soft-as-a-bunny and fits fine, though I forgot to move up to larger needles to do the body after the garter borders, so the borders are somewhat ripply. Steaming helped a bit. And now back to our regularly-scheduled knitting: getting the WIPs in shape, then knitting the stash down in preparation for Black Sheep Gathering in June. Welcome back to the Ravelympics . We're live at the Mitten Moguls, watching pair after pair of amazing mitts, gloves, and mittens come sailing down the track. And here we have a very fetching pair of Fetching mitts, knitted in plushy soft Plymouth Baby Bunny , a cotton, rayon, and angora blend. So soft, and yet machine washable! The cats adore the bunny aroma and have already tried to make off with the first mitt before the second one crossed the finish line. A winner all around. Next up: The Scarf Super-G. Will this knitter cross the finish line before the end of the Olympic events? Stay tuned! It seems that if you're one of the Beautiful People, you can wear any damn thing you like and not only get away with it, but enjoy the ooohs and aaaahs of admiration from the crowd. Check out this post from The Sartorialist and see what I mean. Don't know about that coat, but having the enormous self-confidence and panache required to pull off a Muppet coat is something to aspire to. I think my motto as I approach the "next third" of my life is the Ravatar I saw on Ravelry: "I may be weird, but I'm saving up to be eccentric." ...for the 2010 Ravelympics ! Crazy Ravelry folks from around the world are competing with their favorite teams (and the plural form can hold true for individuals, if one is entirely mental, present company included), knitting like gangbusters to complete their pledged projects before the winter games in Vancouver B.C. come to a close. First project on my list, for Team Ivory Tower (go Eggheads!), is now officially complete since I stopped to buy a glass button on the way home and stitched it on. It's the Spiral Cowl from Knitty Gritty Thoughts, done in Manos del Uruguay, Violets colorway, that I had left from a project completed some time ago, perfect for the Stash Compulsory Dance event. A pretty quick knit, with a pattern that you can memorize by the end of the first round. Next up, Fetching mitts for Team Rose and Ram, the local yarn store team. Not the most original choice, since it's THE number one most popular pattern on Ravelry. But hey, I wanted some mitts, I had the yarn in my stash just waiting for a good project, and it looks like a quick knit. On with the games! KNIT two three four, KNIT two three four! (Cross-posted from my garden blog) This is Mr. Licorice, sometimes known as Mr. Fangs and Claws: He came to us as a half-grown abandoned kitten that wandered into a co-worker's garage. Out of all our feline herd, Licorice is the only one who goes outdoors on his own. Even though he's neutered, he acts like an intact tom: aggressive, territorial, foul tempered when he's indoors; aggressive, territorial, and happy to be petted and adored when he's outdoors. Prozac failed to curb his behavior, and while tempting, I can't keep him under sedation all the time. So we had him microchipped, put a reflective collar on him, cross our fingers and hope for the best, knowing that outdoor cats are exposed to all sorts of risks. Well, Licorice must have run head-on into one of those risks, because Monday evening he came in with an open sore on his chest that on inspection looked like an abscess that had opened up. He seemed chipper enough and had a good appetite, but the next morning it was still open and oozing and had a foul odor, so I confined him to the sick kitty crate for observation and called the vet. Most likely he'd gotten into a fight with another cat, and since the wound was on his chest, he was not the one who backed down! Yeah, that's our Mr. Fangs and Claws. Wednesday morning (after a dose of sedative so getting him in the kitty carrier wasn't quite as bad as wrestling a cactus) he went into the vet's office. By then he'd developed a fever and the wound was still draining. When the vet got him under anesthesia and got the abscess open, it was pretty bad. It had gone deep, the fluid inside was thick and smelly, and there was a patch of skin that had gone necrotic. If we'd tried to treat this at home, he wouldn't have lasted long. So Licorice came home that evening and went straight back into the sick kitty crate. He was pretty agitated and loopy coming off the anesthetic, so I covered the crate with blankets, trying to calm him down. The next morning he was very quiet and subdued, probably hurting from the surgery. His appetite was good, though. And this morning he's a little brighter and demanding to be let out of his crate (sorry, it's kind of a nasty view of the drains in his incision): He's eating well and using the litter box, so recovery looks good, but he's not a happy kitty. Hates the plastic cone. Hates being confined. Hates it when the other cats come and stare at him. Poor, sad kitty: That was a $600 hit to our bank account, and we were already tapped out helping my mother-in-law buy heating fuel. I think we've got just enough left for groceries until payday, but we're going to have to be reeeeal careful. It's 2010, and so far, all is well! Happy New Knitting, everyone, and many wishes for a year filled with new opportunities. May this year bring an improved economy and a better world all around. As for me, while I'm fully appreciative that I have a job with benefits, I'm rather hoping for an even better one this year, so wish me luck with the job search. Or rather -- may a job that is a decided improvement over the job that I have appear in my searches, may I be qualified for it, and may I be the one hired! Now, the old knitting: Christmas knitting is all done and presented. My aunt, who visited shortly after Christmas, received this olive beret and neckwarmer, along with homemade jelly and cookies: Hubby got his first pair of handknit socks, made from Blue Moon Fiber Arts Socks that Rock in Haida, one of their Raven colorways (which rubbed black dye onto my fingers and needles!): And I started AND finished a Forest Canopy Shawl, using a couple of skeins of DK alpaca that I had in the stash from long ago and from an LYS long gone. I still have two more skeins of the stuff to play with. The shawl went amazingly fast. Started it on the 28th of December: Finished knitting and weaving in ends on New Year's Eve, blocked it this morning: And wore it to the knit-in at Rose and Ram, the LYS that is oh-so-conveniently on my way to work: I've gone over my Ravelry projects page and have done an accounting of the projects that I completed in 2009. It was a busy year, knit-wise! Counting the shawl that I finished knitting last night and blocked this morning, I had 32 finished projects listed, which are made up of the following: 2 shawls 1 lace kerchief 7 pairs of socks 3 adult hats 1 baby hat 25 preemie caps 2 neckwarmers 1 lace cowl 1 pair of fingerless gloves 1 cabled shrug 3 stuffed toys 1 baby vest 2 baby sweaters 1 pair of baby jeans 2 baby bibs 1 baby blanket 1 CD drive cozy 1 mug cozy Plus 4 UFOs to finish in 2010. Holy cow, I really did all that? And people wonder what I do instead of dribbling away each evening watching TV... To kick off a new year of knitting, I went to the knit-in at the Rose and Ram , along with several others in the Salem Area Ravelers and local knitters and spinners. A good knitting time was had by all: Helen, one of the mods for Salem Area Ravelers, has been collecting preemie caps for the last couple of months, hoping to have a sackful to deliver to the hospital for St. Distaff's Day . Our final count was 75 hats! Since Jan was nice enough to open the shop on New Year's Day for a knit-in, lots of folks made it a point to buy something nice. I picked up two skeins of something new to the shop, this Hacho sportweight wool by Mirasol, intended for a Lacy Baktus shoulder shawl: After a couple of false starts, I got a pair of Sailor's Delight socks from 2-at-a-Time Socks started for my first new WIP for 2010: The instructions in the book are for Magic Loop knitting, and I wanted to do them on two circulars. After fiddling, fiddling, fiddling, ripping out all the cast-on stitches, casting on again, I finally got started by doing the first three rounds of one sock, casting the second on DPNs, doing the first three rounds on that sock, and sliding the second sock onto the circular needles. Hey, whatever works. I'm loving this colorway -- it's Lorna's Laces Shepherd Sock in Edgewater (208) that I bought at Dublin Bay on last spring's yarn crawl . So on to 2010! My knitting plans for this year: Last year was the Summer of the Sock, where I knit my first pair of socks and tacked several more pairs. This year is going to be the Year of the Shawl. The alpaca shawl was just the start. I'm planning to work on some lace knitting skills. Finish all of last year's UFOs. Maybe... maybe... before starting any more WIPs? Maybe? Well, except for an upcoming KAL and whatever service knitting comes along. Knit down the stash! I intend to knit down what I have until the stash box can comfortably close again! I must knit at least two skeins before buying one new one! Hey, there's a new Sock Summit planned for 2011, so I've got to free up some stash space before then! Exception: yarn purchased for gifts or service projects.
These paintings from Frida Kahlo (career of 1926 until her death in 1954) show vivid colors, realistic details and her signature complex symbolism relating to specific incidents in her life. My favorite being her personified shot down deer, a brilliant representation of her emotional state. nypl Al Wadzinski creates sculptural art from found objects. His amazing sculptures utilize a large amalgam of miscellaneous items. The first sculpture in this set, my favorite, is very mystical and raw. Wadzinski from Oshkosh Wisconsin, did not set out to make recycled and salvaged eco art, but with his exciting menagerie of creations I am thankful he did. More on the artist here .

Hello b.vikki vintage readers, I've not forsaken you completely! Yes, it's been a long while since I've posted, but I wanted to share some news with you all and POSSIBLY get your help with a new venture: I'll be freelancing for the next three month over at Zora&amp;Alice ( zora-alice.com ), a new blog and monthly magazine aiming to start a new conversation about black women. Read more about Zora&amp;Alice HERE &amp; below: The Mission: Zora&amp;Alice magazine’s mission is to be the premier online destination for quality reporting and analysis on issues that affect contemporary, young black women. At any given time, we hope to accomplish three of the four: To provide a fresh, intelligent voice for young black women To empower and uplift young black women as they develop unique identities To support and promote young black women as entrepreneurs, creators and pioneers To wear power pumps and rule the world like the stone cold forces we know ourselves to be About the Name: Our name is inspired by the collection ” I Love Myself When I’m Laughing…And Then Again When I’m Looking Mean &amp; Impressive,” an anthology of works by Zora Neale Hurston and edited by Alice Walker. Zora Neale Hurston was an iconoclast, underappreciated and condemned for her independence, whose many contributions to American literary canon would have been ignored were it not for the persistence of those she inspired, including Walker. I've pursued more interests in my 23 years than I care to recount, but the constant through them all has been writing and literature. I'm very excited to be involved with Zora&amp;Alice and hope you all will check it out in April at the time of its launch. Of course, I'll have lots to say about vintage fashion, among other things, so be sure to sign up for the Zora&amp;Alice email list to stay updated on the magazine's progress. Also, if you are, or know of any great black Etsy retailers, leave your/their info in the comments or email me at becca.oneal@gmail.com! Last but not least, I've got about 20 vintage dresses on my hands and I'll be doing a giveaway VERY soon, so if you like winning free clothes, stay tuned for more info. More posts coming soon! ;) More menswear! The following images are featured in reverse chronological order from the years 1960-1962 with a final photo from 1954. http://menincardigans.tumblr.com/ The above editorial reminds me a bit of the Mad Men season 2 poster - and the train scenes from Revolutionary Road: I know this post is about vintage mens' fashions, but I love the chunky three-stand pearl necklace and wiggle dress on the female model! I wouldn't mind seeing more modern men in patterned blazers! He certainly looks to be in the midst of a jaunty number! A 1961 model dressed like a 2009 hipster dressed like an 1890s dandy (according to the New York Times Style Section, if you want to take their word for it)... A thing like that! And who doesn't love plus-fours? Is that a Bolex you're holding? Like his frames. LOVE her dress! Glitter isn't an oft used term in menswear descriptions these days, but I heartily welcome its return!

The Brooklyn Circus - video http://thebkcircus.com/bkc/ http://putthison.com (All of Jesse Thorn's projects are worth a gander, but this is one of my personal favorites. I also highly recommend his non-fashion related podcast The Sound of Young America) http://streetetiquette.com/ http://nerdboyfriend.tumblr.com/ This post is all about links! First, I want to link to this great post at AfroDandy about Black / African Pin-up art . I'm a big fan of Bettie Page , but have either neglected to seek out or failed to come across many images of Black pin-up models. The image below, originally featured on The Pin-Up Blog caught my eye and I couldn't resist posting it here: The photos are great, but be sure to read Zavi's post! Within that post, was a link to a blog I'd stumbled upon a few months ago while doing research for b.vikki vintage, but had, until the post at AfroDandy, nearly forgotten all about (I almost imperceptibly linked to it in my post on the movie Reet, Petite, and Gone ) : Ladies of Harlem ! It's a simple, one page site, but the pictures speak volumes! I'll be posting more consistently in the coming days: more mens fashions from the 50s and early-mid 1960s, part 2 of Vintage Black Voters and Politicians, and the Vintage Black Brides series will move into 1961.... and if you read this blog, you know that I never EVER stick to a schedule, so there will be plenty of mix-ups and unexpected posts along the way. Today is my 23rd birthday! And the three month anniversary of b.vikki vintage! Thank you all for reading. Don't forget to visit b.vikki vintage on Etsy! The first Vintage Black Weddings post of the 1960s! I've been looking forward to breaking into this decade, as the gown styles become more fashion forward seemingly overnight. The line of demarcation is so pronounced it seems there was no time to transition. In this post, featuring gowns, weddings, and brides from the year 1960, you can whet your appetites with a brief taste of the styles to come. I remember hearing during a Making Of Mad Men special that they chose to set the first season of the show in 1960 because the last year of any decade is the culmination of the culture of the one it proceeds (for example: the year that best sums up 1980s style and culture was 1990). This post can be added to the anecdotal evidence column in proof of that theory. As you can see, the prevalent 1950s trend of longsleeved gowns with scalloped or diaphanous necklines is still dominant in 1960. What I love most about this photo is that the affection is so clearly evident! Looking at so many wedding photos has desensitized me to the occasion a bit, but images like the one above remind me of what it's all about. In the image above, from a 1960 Ebony Fashion Fair editorial, you can see the gown styles shifting from the traditional silhouettes of the 1950s to more mod, architectural designs of the 1960s. In the next installment of Vintage Black Weddings, this shift becomes even more apparent. Because the photo above is from a pictorial and straight from the runway, it's a few years before this style trickles down to every day brides. But when it finally does, it revolutionizes bridal fashion. A wedding fountain! A thing like that! Trans-World Airlines' first Black hostess - reminds me of this post. Eartha Kitt's 1960 wedding to John "Bill" McDonald must have been stunning. Her contoured illusion neckline is really beautiful in satin. The next Vintage Black Weddings post, featuring images from 1961, is quite the departure from previous installments. I'm looking forward to sharing it with you all. Thanks for reading.

I'd missed being of age to vote in the previous Presidential election of 2000 by only 6 months. By 2008, I'd voted in several local and senatorial elections, including my having voted for Barack Obama for senator in my home state of Illinois in 2004. During the summer of 2005, I interned at a political fundraising firm and got a brief taste of the political arena in Chicago and Illinois. Kwame Raoul, the state senator who filled the seat evacuated by Obama when he was elected to the United States Senate, was among the firm's client. For an exceptionally transient moment in time, I thought I'd enter politics and was enamored of all its glamour. I remember exactly where I was when Barack Obama announced his candidacy for the presidency. There'd been much teasing in the months preceding his official declaration, on local new shows and before football games, all to innocuous results. It was February 2006. I was in Cincinnati for a party with friends from Chicago. We turned on the television at our host's home, which was crowded with 18 and 19 year olds, and a few young 20-somethings, tired from the night before, jaded in ways I probably don't need to describe any further, to find Barack Obama on the capitol steps at Springfield making his presidential run official. Everyone in the room understood the significance. I'd never, at the time, been more proud to be a young voter from Chicago. Since that day, November 4th 2008 and January 20th 2009 have eclipsed the pride I then felt. Not to diminish my generation's role in the election of Barack Obama, but I can't imagine the impact and overwhelming emotions felt by voters of color in the 1950s and 1960s, who dared to vote in the South while being confronted with threats of violence, of those who partook in and witnessed the election of an ally in Kennedy. The images below begin to tell their stories: This Leaders of Womanpower group reminds me of Betty Draper's Junior League in season 3 of Mad Men. In the coming days, I'll post more images and article excerpts of voters and politicians of color from 1963-1969. I'll also be continuing the Vintage Black Weddings and Vintage Menswear series, and will have more information, images, and clips from Vintage Black Films. Thank you for reading!

I've gotten more than a few requests to feature menswear on b.vikki vintage and to offer men's items in my Etsy shop. Of course! Who doesn't want to look like Don Draper? In the nascent days of b.vikki vintage I did a post featuring After 6 Tuxedo ads from 1959 - 1968 . As a continuation of that post, I offer the following vintage menswear looks (editorials and ads) as sartorial inspiration for male readers of b.vikki vintage. The images below are from 1968 and 1969 editions of Ebony Magazine. Enjoy! Men certainly didn't seem to be afraid of color in the late 1960s! I still love a man in a cardigan. It's a great way to look. The author of one of my favorite Tumblrs seems to agree: http://menincardigans.tumblr.com/ This Paris brand undergarments ad from 1969 evokes American Apparel, no? Several of the pictorials featured here that were shot at the Playboy headquarters in Chicago - which was, incidentally, very close to the Ebony Magazine headquarters. Hats! Hats should definitely come back. I know this post is about men, but that lime green two-piece ensemble is stunning. I'll continue this post later (probably later today) with earlier vintage menswear looks from the 1950s and early to mid 1960s. Here are some of my favorite menswear items available for sale on Etsy.

What I actually do would be more accurately described as lurking at thrift stores and estate sales), I'll be sure to keep a keen eye out for any fascinating men's items! I'm a fan of foppish dandies, as I fancy myself an eventual quaintrelle, so this post has been LONG overdue.

Before two and a half weeks ago I'd posted on b.vikki vintage regularly every day. I now plan to pick up the frequency yet again and get things back to normal around here! Here are some photographs and editorial shots from vintage issues of Ebony and Jet magazines from 1953 to 1967 of winter holiday celebrations and scenarios. The photo above is my favorite. We're getting to see a party, this one from 1963, in media res. The subjects aren't self-conscious and seems to be genuinely having a GREAT time. Wishing a safe and happy holiday season to all b.vikki vintage readers! Thanks for reading. Don't forget to visit b.vikki vintage on Etsy!
