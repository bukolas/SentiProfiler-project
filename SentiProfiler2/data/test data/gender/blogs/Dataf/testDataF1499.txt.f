When I was younger, I loved stuffed animals. I had so many stuffed animals in my room and even more beanie babies. Whenever I did get a new stuffed animal, I would always pick one out and then second guess my choice. I would worry about not "saving" the other animals from the store.

I vividly remember being in a gift shop of a hotel and picking out a new stuffed animal. There were essentially two different choices. I could get the dog with the brown spots or the dog with the black spots. But it was so much more complicated than that with me. I chose the dog with the brown spots and then I wondered which of the brown-spotted dogs to choose. I closed my eyes quickly picked one up. When I opened my eyes, I looked at all the dogs still on display that I hadn't chosen. I promised myself that when I came back to the hotel, I'd "save" the rest of them.

So you can only imagine my struggle in picking out a guinea pig to save at the pet store. The poor little furballs had probably never been touched since they'd arrived at Pet Co. and they're all in the clear plexi-glass boxes, which are horrible for them to begin with, with crappy bedding (litterally) and such little space to move. Thank god we had to get a girl (since Mike's sister has a girl guinea pig and we want them to play together without having to worry about little baby guinea pigs), or else the decision would have taken hours.

There were four female guinea pigs available at Pet Co. the day we went in to get our guinea pig. There were two white ones which I quickly eliminated, sadly, completely based on the color of their skin. They had the red eyes and just didn't look like guinea pigs really. I felt so bad for them because they would probably not be adopted for a while.. maybe not ever. Just thinking about them now is making me sad. I should have been less appearance-focused and maybe got one of them, but I didn't.

It was incredibly hard to decide between the other two. I had liked the one's that fur looked like a calico cat's. Mike liked the brown one with the white stripe. The guinea pig would be mine, but I wanted Mike to love her too. It was all my decision and I was bringing her into our apartment and he promised he would help financially and with feeding and cleaning her cage. I knew I would love which ever guinea pig we chose.

The calico one was especially cute because her nose was even spotted-- half was white and half was black. But the one with the white stripe was a lot more active. We had actually came to Pet Co. three times in the week and she was always awake and jumping around the cage. The calico one was always asleep. Also, Mike and I had decided on a name beforehand, Pikachu, and the brown one looked more like a "Pikachu" to me. So based on her personality, the name we chose and Mike's previous opinion that he liked the brown one more, I chose the brown one.
