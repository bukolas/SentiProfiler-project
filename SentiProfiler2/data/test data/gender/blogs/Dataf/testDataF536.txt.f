well, i finally sat down to write testi for one of my grt friend. seetha thats how i call Ramya, is one of my oldest friend. our friendship has flourished our lives. my memories are still so fresh. we had silly fights and i still remember one of them. seetha and me are same height, so in our class we sat in height order & thereby i had to sit with her. seetha used to fight alot. (so slightly scared). and then to avoid fights, we used to measure the length of the bench & then divide it by 2. & draw a line using chalk, declaring borders. it was like LOC only. missing those crazy school days. and now i see the same beautiful girl in a very different perspective. she has grown bold, daring and so matured. i doubt whether seetha fights nowadays. i can never see anyone who can be so ambitious & stand up inspite of lot of struggles in life. she is very friendly & i admire the contacts she has with old friends. she never forgets you, if u r in her friendship list. wish our friendship lasts forever. keep smiling dear.
