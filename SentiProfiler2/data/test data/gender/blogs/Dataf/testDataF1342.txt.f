After a year and a half off from racing, it was time to think about doing another tri. But since I’m still dealing with some atrophy in my left leg, the idea of doing much running didn’t appeal – even though I’m a runner. I was just enjoying getting back into a more regular routine of training. I swear I missed my friends and the lifestyle more than the races – even though the races act as a big giant carrot to motivate me to train. In January, I had an epiphany on the way home from my Master’s Swim workout. ‘Hey, if I can swim 3,000 yards now, maybe I can swim 2.4 miles by the summer.’ I kept that thought to myself for a couple of weeks. Then I confessed my crazy thought-slash-pipe dream to Sharkbait. And later that week, I asked my trail patrol partner, The Governor, if he thought I could ride my bike 112 miles by the summer. (He knows I’m out of shape and I’ve never done a century in my life.) And since, I can be really insecure sometimes I got three more second opinions. I asked my swim coach, Mary, 734’s Dad, and my rehab therapist, Quinn, if they thought I could go those distances. No one hesitated – except me. ‘Should I do it? Should I do it?’ After thinking about it another day, I finally hit the ‘Submit’ button. Game on. I’m doing the Full Vineman Aquabike on July 31st. It’ll be just like doing an Ironman without the 26-mile run-walk-‘til-I-drop. It will give me a chance to really work on my triathlon weaknesses. And it will give me time to gain back all that quad muscle strength before I do some serious running and racing again. I’m going long with the goal of getting strong. Last year, I saw an older woman with a walker enter the rehab pool. She had a t-shirt with big letters bedazzled in silver dots that said, “FIERCE.” That pretty much described the weather out here in the past couple of weeks. The music in our pilates class was interrupted by a tornado warning issued by the National Weather Service. We were dumbfounded. That doesn’t happen in Southern California. If anything, we get waterspouts offshore. We used levity to hide our concern and joked about taking shelter under the reformer. When I got out to my car, there were two messages from 734’s Dad. And by the time I got home, the phone rang again and this time it was my dad in Boston, sounding a tad agitated because he saw my neighborhood on the news. Turns out the tornado touched down two miles from my place. I had no idea. I downplayed the whole thing and said the news trucks always hang out for the waves and the puddles in January. Ha, I had NO idea a truck and two boats had been flipped nearby. Roofs had been torn off and windows broken. I live near the beach with an ocean view. Watching the waves come in was like watching fireworks. I couldn’t stop gawking at them. And in the middle of the night, if the wind howled a little too much, I ran into the living room – away from the windows. We had tons of people who came by our pier to assess the damage to the beach and take pictures of the ocean. Pictures that only told half the story. Because the sound that they made, the smell, and the way they shook the shore and the pier was nothing short of FIERCE. After only a half dozen Master’s swimming workouts, I’m starting to notice a few distinct changes. 1. I can swim a lot farther than I thought. Last night my training log calculated 7.59 miles so far this year. (In a perfect world, it would’ve been 7.34, but Coach Mary pushed me to go longer.) 2. I’m learning how to do swim strokes that I’ve never really attempted before because no one ever made me or showed me how to do them. My backstroke isn’t pretty, but I haven’t caused any damage to my training partners yet. 3. I’m cramping so badly during workouts that my body feels possessed after 1,500-2,000 yards. I figure my toes and calves are going through an adaptation phase. Or maybe it should be classified as hazing since this Master’s group feels a bit like a sorority when we’re laughing about our workouts in the locker room. 4. My laundry hamper is piling up a lot faster with big towels. 5. I’m frequently reaching for those Swimmer’s eardrops. 6. I’m positively giddy with endorphins after each workout. 7. My happiness quotient has gone way up. Sharkbait noticed a difference too. Near the end of Wednesday’s workout, she called out to me from a couple of lanes away with a smile and a nod of approval, “You’re gliding!” “What?” I replied. “You’re gliding!!” “Oh,” I answered. A compliment on my swimming definitely takes a little while to register. I wondered, ‘Have I ever glided before? And if so, when?’ There I go overanalyzing things again. Who cares? For one length of the pool, it happened. I had a witness. I’m ending this post with a shout out to some of my favorite bloggers. This week’s Six’s Picks include the new Mr . and Mrs. James Walsh , Running is Funny , TriTawn , Steve in a Speedo?! Gross! (and his lovely wife Pharmie ). Last year, I reluctantly kept track of my workout log. I found myself filling in some of the blanks at the end of ’09 like it was the week before taxes. I pieced things together by asking for copies of my workout log at the gym and scanning my Garmin data. Sadly, most of my swim workouts never got recorded. I know I did a bunch of them with a pull buoy at the local school’s pool. Enter the New Year’s Resolution: be more consistent. That applies to everything from filling out my log on Fitness Journal.com to cleaning out the fridge. And with this resolution comes another (which I’ve been working on for a few months), don’t fret, worry or feel guilty about all the stuff that didn’t get done. I’m trying to focus more on the doing and less on the angst of what I’m not getting done. I know I may slip from time to time on this one, but I’ll keep plugging away at it. I’m happy to report that 2010 is off to a great start. In the first 10 days of the year, I’ve worked out on 7 days doing 7 different activities. And this afternoon, I think I rinsed out 7 old condiment jars and put them in the recycling bin. Seven (aka 734, the cat) will be so proud. Actually, he won’t care as long as I hide 7 treats around the house to keep him occupied. I’m savoring the holidays as much as possible. I know, I know, time to move on to the resolutions. I’m stalling big time. I don’t even want to take my tree down, but I will this afternoon. Suffice it to say, the holidays were just what I needed this year. Perhaps they should add another Christmas in July just to stimulate the economy and raise morale. I don’t think it’s just me. Everyone seems to be in a better mood. I had a great time kicking back with my loved ones, finding gifts, wrapping them and all of that good stuff. And while I had to use more restraint than I would have liked this year, it was the thought that counted – both on the giving and receiving end. One of my favorite gifts came with this custom tag created by 734’s Dad’s brother Ken . How cool. It was attached to some tempo music, The Gorillaz Demon Days CD. My family, 734’s Dad , and my training partners came through with some awesome gifts to get me in the mood to train. More importantly, they made me feel like an athlete again. Sharkbait gave me some cycling socks with autumn leaves to remind me of home and an assortment of gels and electrolyte drink mixes. TriDiver gave me some Pearl Izumi running gloves and a Triathlete license plate holder. My marathoner sister, Jane, gave me a nice running jacket. Ryan surprised me with a text, “Hey, don’t do anything stupid like renewing your subscription to Triathlete Magazine. Merry Christmas!” And 734’s Dad gave me everything on my wish list. Wow, how did he ever know? (That’s right, I hinted big time.) When I opened the Finis Hydro Hip training tool, he said, “Hey, I thought only maxi pads had wings!” I know he secretly gets a kick out of seeing all the idiosyncrasies that go along triathlon training. 734’s Dad’s parents gave me a very generous check to pass onto the Challenged Athletes Foundation . They knew I would have liked to do Operation Rebound again last year at Oceanside. I was quite touched by that gesture. And one of my all-time favorite gifts came from Nikki, Sharkbait’s daughter. Since the kid recently went through quite a growth spurt, I received her old TYR split fins. I heard good things about these fins. I’m hoping they really improve my swim. I’m also hoping that osmosis takes affect because this girl can swim 100 yards in 1:15. Yeah, I wanna swim like her! Hmm, okay I just don’t want to be lapped by her. ‘Cause that wouldn’t be very nice to do to “Mealie Minnow” would it? Uh-oh, I think I just signed up for my first swim race. Rumor has it, the kid reads my blog. When I arrived at the pool last night, it was about 45 degrees. If this steam and fog came off a big black caldron, you’d swear it was some sort of witch’s brew. A cold and holiday festivities kept me out of the pool for a couple of weeks. I was excited to get back in there. Coach Mary gave me some instructions for a set, “Okay, I want you to leave on the :40.” I suspect I wasn’t quite that punctual, but I really have no idea. I was having a Lucy/Miss Magoo moment out there. I couldn’t see the clock through the fog at the other end of the pool. I couldn’t see how much time elapsed on my lap counter. And I was fumbling with my Polar to get it to stopwatch mode because I couldn’t see the numbers on that either. Rather than draw attention to my inability to see, I just swam as fast as I could and tried not to dawdle too much in between. I swam until I had goose bumps on my goose bumps and my left calf and right toes cramped. Mary still made me do a cool down with a pull buoy. I knew she was right, but it sure didn’t feel like I needed a cool down with the onset of hypothermia. I managed to go 2,050 yards. After a nice hot shower, Sharkbait invited me over to her house for some ham-and-split pea soup. Is there anything better on a cold night? It reminded me of snow days in Massachusetts, when school was cancelled and I could sled for hours in the backyard. When I arrived at her house, Sharkbait lamented, “I couldn’t see anything in that fog! I couldn’t make out the clock or see the numbers on my watch.” I felt so relieved that it wasn't just me. Now, if Barracuda could just come out with foggy night-vision goggles next. Aside from all the fun holiday celebrations, my absolute favorite thing this past week was getting back to the dirt. Some women like perfume. I like the smell of dirt. The sting of the crisp, cool air. And the sound of the reeds rustling in the wind. I got it all when I went for a trail run on the afternoon before Christmas Eve. It turned out to be 4.33 miles and it felt just right. I had to walk it in a couple of the steep spots, but overall I was able to run. And I’m very happy to report that it didn’t feel like I needed to borrow a lung. I was truly surprised that it felt that good. I did not expect that YET. So the day after Christmas, I did it all over again. Both days, I went out in my new XTERRA XR 1.0 shoes . They felt super-comfortable out there. No complaints whatsoever. On Sunday, I had my monthly trail patrol for the California State Parks. My third time back. Keith, the Governor, lead the way. I started out great and made it up a mile climb without too much trouble, although I’m sure I was quite slow. When we hit “No Dogs” I couldn’t make it up the second hill, and I didn’t clip out fast enough. I didn’t want to land on my knee and instead I kind of hyper-extended my left leg and fell backwards. Next thing I knew I was on the ground on my back with my Santa Cruz Blur stuck between my legs at an awkward angle. A little embarrassing trying to extricate myself and get back up, except no one witnessed it. Ha! Keith and Dan were already waiting at the top. Falling is just part of mountain biking. But I could feel the disparity in my quad muscle strength as I attempted the climb. It’s a little bit of a bummer, but I know it will get better. It messed with my head for the rest of the ride though. We went on a new singletrack trail that was built with Keith’s help while I was away – Ticketron. Normally, it would’ve been no problem. Okay, maybe I would have popped off the bike in a couple of places. Instead, I walked a lot of it with my bike. The steep climb out of Deer Canyon usually called for some hike-a-biking, but I was doin’ way more hikin’ than bikin’. When we arrived at the first stretch of single track on Fenceline, it was no problem, but the second stretch, I had to clip out so quickly and so often that I gave up and walked the rest of the way. My knee ached a little – enough to give up on the idea of doing a brick workout with a little run afterwards. I got through it. I went to places I haven’t been to in a long time on my mountain bike. And I had a lot of fun hanging out with the guys. Dan thought for sure that he would slow us down. Nope, it was me. When we stopped for some nutrition, I mentioned that I really liked the Hammer Gel Apple Cinnamon flavor. I said, “Wow, this tastes just like apple pie.” Dan replied right back, “Oh, I’d need ice cream with that…” Which pretty much gives you the flavor of the conversation that went back and forth between three immature trail patrol volunteers. When we arrived back in the parking lot, we had a visit from 734’s Dad who rode across a couple of mountain ranges to meet up with us and say “Hi!” What a guy! Next week, I get to do it all over again. Hmmm, maybe I’ll take a different route. Would you believe Slow ‘n Easy? Yup, that’s a trail. A winding mile-and-a-quarter fire road. I wasn’t really sure what I’d write about here after my knee surgery last winter. I knew I wouldn’t have a triathlon season. I wanted to talk to others who came back strong after being sidelined. It was an idea that was kickin’ around in my head for a few weeks when the unthinkable happened. A dear friend of mine was in a serious ski accident and suffered a spinal cord injury, and a few days later a stroke. I felt helpless to do anything for him as he lay in the hospital. I decided to start a new series: Comeback Kids. I’d do a new story every Friday for him, his family, and his closest buddies – for as long as he was in the hospital. That was the plan. I had no idea how I’d pull it off. I put it out there and hoped for the best. And I truly met the best in the process. Friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers who were more than willing to do the phone interviews, email me pictures, and review their story drafts prior to posting on the big Friday deadline. They divulged some pretty personal stuff, some pearls of wisdom, and always some kind words for my buddy. I’d like to thank each every one of them once again. Hall of Fame Triathlete Karen Smyers who called me from a yellow cab in New York City on a business trip. Pro triathlete Joanna Zeiger who said, “Don’t quit with your rehab until you are satisfied with the results.” Yes, she spent five hours a day doing rehab for her back injury. (She inspires me to keep doing two or three-hour workouts at my rehab gym.) My physical therapy aide and former NFL player, Erroll Tucker , who still encourages me during every weight workout. I’d venture to say that every single one of these Comeback Kids has a lot of heart, but Dwight Kroening completed Ironman Canada after receiving a heart transplant and Wayne “The Dead Guy” Wright completed 50 Marathons in 50 U.S. States this October after undergoing a quadruple bypass. Dennis Tapp found a way to ride his bike across the country with the partial paralysis caused by five gunshots. Sterling Kwong completed Ironman Arizona after battling testicular cancer. Casey Kammel completed Ironman Coeur d'Alene in unique style after being told he’d never walk again. Andy Bailey came back from a life-threatening MRSA infection and amputation to compete in triathlons again (at the age of 70). Pitcher Kara Nilan returned to collegiate play after suffering a traumatic brain injury on the mound. My fellow rehab patient, Lydia , continues to bravely fight cancer on top of the severe back pain from her paragliding accident. And my dear coach, Beth Hibbard , became a pro triathlete after breaking her neck. Tawnee Prazak and Kevin Quadrozzi , I have little doubt
that you’ll both make it to Kona some day. My fellow trail patrol mountain biker, Jane , continues to inspire me as I hit the trails with a little trepidation these days. My friend Laurie shattered some bones in her foot doing an Irish jig, and completed an ultra-marathon less than a year later. Ken Stephenson helped me start this series off with a bang and his brother Brad helped me keep the streak alive. (Yes, there will be something nice for you under the tree, I mean in the fridge, this Christmas!) Some thought their stories and their injuries weren’t that special. From where I sit, they were all special. Every day someone finds this blog because they searched Google for words like “plica syndrome,” “broken collarbone,” or “tibial plateau fracture.” I’ve received thank-you notes from readers – from Colorado to France to South Africa – who have said they were inspired by your stories. You helped me immensely. You helped my friend and his loved ones. You helped keep this magical thing going for 18 weeks until my buddy was discharged from the hospital. Last week, he started walking again with assistance. I look forward to the day when I can write his Comeback Kid story. Until then, I plan to write a few more of these stories in the year ahead. And I thank you for making all of these stories possible. Happy holidays!
