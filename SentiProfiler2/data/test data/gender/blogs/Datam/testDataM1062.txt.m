I recently saw a krafts cheese add on TV. The commercial talks about how great kraft's is and towards the end it say's "A country is only as good as it's cheese, and Ours (kraft's cheese) doesn't have holes in it." Now I know that a lot of people could care less what a craft's cheese add has to say towards anything.
But to me this really rings "stupid". I'm glad craft's thinks that America is this amazing country. Now of course, I do think that their are few things that actually make this country amazing. First off our education system. Very few places in this world give EVERYONE the opportunity to have an education. I do believe that it's American's who are growing more stupid everyday, because people could careless weather their children have an education or not. Another thing which makes our country amazing is the opportunities that some are given, most people have the opportunity to do things that in some countries would be impossible to do.
