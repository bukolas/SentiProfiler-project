Hi...So mathura...One who always tells me that i study too much but the truth is she is studying too much...I never know who she was until one day...We were all busy completing the record. We both had Graphics toolkit an unusual project.I got all my doors shut for completing it in the last minute. It was that time she helped me to complete the record.Thank god i completed it..Ever since that she has been a good friend to me and had shared few things...Though we dont talk much she has always been there...

She deserves a lot more for her talents and i hope she achieves it...Best of luck mathura..Great to have met u...
