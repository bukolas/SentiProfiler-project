I know I haven't posted in awhile -- hope everyone made it through the holidays o.k. Wanted to bring your attention to a few Alzheimer's related things coming up -- On Tuesday, January 12th the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric will air a 6 minute segment on Alzheimer's entitled "Where American Stands on Alzheimer's". A three generation family will be interviewed with two the generations diagnosed with the disease. I hope you will tune in to watch and let CBS know how much we appreciate them airing it! February 8th is Alzheimer's Awareness Day at the Capitol in Atlanta. We need everyone there -- here is a link to the Georgia Chapter's site for more information. Please make plans now to attend.
