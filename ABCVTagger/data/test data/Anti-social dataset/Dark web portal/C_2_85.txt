Peace be upon you all, The "article" posted by abu yasir is actually a letter from a Hindu living in the US who seems to be Anti-Islam. (Google for "Uday Tate" and read the Jerusalem Post link under letters) It is really unfair to call it a war against Islam but I agree there have been people calling it that. A recent incident on KABC radio - there's a program called "Ken and Co." and Ken's co-host Dan said "The faith that promotes suicide bombings should be wiped out..." He was talking about Islam and Muslims in the USA and all over the world and then the Middle East how they called suicide bombers "martyrs" then he makes that comment. I was amazed and shocked he said that on the radio. A Muslim listener called him up after about 15-20 mins on live radio and peacefully confronted him, Told him it was not Islam that promoted suicide bombings, there's nothing in the Quran about suicide bombings, that people blowing themselves up in the Middle East were not doing it for religious reasons (Why else would Marxists and Christians also blow themselves up) but that they considered it a valid force of resistance (Whether it is or not is another issue) to Israeli illegal occupation. He also went on to explain that Israelis bulldozed people in their own homes elderly and disabled people were killed mercilessly - Should Judaism be wiped out for that? Peace
