Mr. Needham asked the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what are the numbers employed at RAF Kemble; what are their ages and grades; how many will have their jobs terminated if the closure of RAF Kemble takes place; and how many personnel will be offered alternative jobs at the other units to which work is transferred;
(2) whether, if RAF Kemble is closed, redundancies will take place in the mobile grades.
Mr. Wiggin: I shall write to my hon. Friend about the number of employees and their ages and grades. It is not possible to say how many would be made redundant or offered alternative jobs if RAF Kemble were to close. This would depend on a number of factors such as the level of natural wastage and to what extent suitable alternative jobs exist within the Ministry of Defence or other Government Departments.
