i know, it was early, but they had it on Saturday for some reason. it also rained cats and dogs. Reporters in the rotunda. Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn't get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird. We had escaped to Arizona to feel some heat on our skin and breathe that lingering citrus and desert smell. I was laying in the backyard, my arms tired from a canoe ride that morning and little wooden plates of cheese, crackers and hummus appear from the house and the family gets their picnic on. Half knowingly I left my camera sitting for most of the trip but had to pick it up just to remember how nice it felt to sit on the lawn with the Cricket and her family, feel springs sneak peek, mix German and English mid sentence and eat good cheese. This is Manfred, visiting from Berlin and thoroughly enjoying all that surrounded us. The Bishop of Salt Lake City had some nice light going on at a concert downtown. I had to shoot a fire/suspected arson a few nights ago. It always amazes me how open some people can be in a tragic situation. This mother, her mother and two kids were woken up by a neighbor banging on the door telling them to get out of the house. They didn't have time to get sweaters or coats and had been outside in a Utah winter for at least 25 minutes by the time I arrived. I chatted with them for a bit, they were obviously still shook up and worrying about where they were going to sleep. I asked if I could shoot a few photos for the paper and they said that was fine. I stuck around and we talked for a bit and I started to wonder why they were so open and friendly to a stranger hired to be privy to their problems. These things have been in my mind quite a bit since returning from Haiti. There has been quite a bit of talk about the morality and ethics of photojournalists in Haiti following the quake. I read some of it and had to open up a bit so I wouldn't get too defensive while reading the criticisms of some of the media working down there. I am not afraid of good dialogue so I left a few comments on some of these critical blog postings. My feeling was that, in some cases 'being there' and documenting someones life is an implicit display of respect for the value of the situation. Joy and her mother Sandra (pictured) further cemented this idea for me. There is an entire discussion regarding photographic approach and sensationalism which belongs to this examination, but for this post, I'll just assume that you know what I mean. The problem is that there are hundreds of variables in every sit uation where photos are taken in the name of photojournalism, so an application of some overarching philosophy has it's faults. But as far as this little family is concerned, I felt like they were open to me in that moment because that respect was apparent. Maybe not, but I wanted to at least precede Haiti photos with some sort of introduction into how I feel about what I do and those in the photographs. LGBT community protesting some remarks made in association with the announcement that their issues aren't on the schedule for the Legislative Calendar this year. Whether you are aligned with them or not, it seems like a real cop out from the law makers to just avoid a group of issues...especially when it's coincidentally an election year. Sometimes as a photojournalist you are right in the thick of things and still don't get the full story. From what common sense tells me, avoiding an issue that is obviously really important to large groups of people doesn't seem like representation. Anyone who knows more, specifically about this here in SL is welcome to comment, wouldn't mind being enlightened.
