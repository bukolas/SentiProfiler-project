OK I thought the first post was long enough as it is, so here is the second part of my rig building process. The next component in question is the Power Supply a.k.a PSU. I never really thought I have to invest in something like a PSU. I didn't quite expect the choice of PSU to be of high importance and now after enough enlightenment from my fellow PC assemblers, I have learned to respect them. The choice of the PSU can either power your system or can blow your rig sky high or it can melt your motherboards beyond recognition.

This wasn't the first choice that came to the mind of TE members when I asked for suggestions for PSU. The first was the Gigabyte Superb 460W and the second was Seasonic S12II-380W. Both these were really good products from what I read from reviews elsewhere. Then after assessing that the Seasonic was better than the Gigabyte product I decided to go with it. But unfortunately the place where I went to seek out this product haven't even of the name Seasonic. One guy even took and gave me a zebronics PSU. Zebronic and Seasonic does sound a lot similar don't they. Again I had to look out for alternatives. Thus I came upon the Corsair VX 450W. Well it was a bit too costly for me though. Nevertheless it is the perfect fit. Best features of this PSU are really quite fan and nylon sleeved wires for better wire management in your cabinet. Bought this PSU for a princely sum of 4050Rs in Richie Street. Though right now its an overkill for my current config without a GPU. But it definitely is a good choice considering the fact that I would definitely get myself a GPU probably the ATI Radeon HD5770 or the 5750. Here are some reviews to help you along with your decision.

I slept while hearing this and it was playing till morning :). The song lyrics are too good even though I had a hard time understanding most of the words since they don't seem to be the regular hindi words which I usually hear or some other kind of dialect, not really sure which one. But I love this song. Just this song alone has made me want to see this movie. So I'm definitely watching this movie. Also the picturization of the song is also too good plus the voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and the laid back nature all makes this a song a super hit. Have to thank Vishal Bharadwaj for this beautiful music. Enjoy the song Dil To Bachcha Hai . I don't ever remember writing a post for a single song. But I haven't written about that many things either he he ... <!-- My New System , originally uploaded by Rakesh Ashok . After nearly 9 years I have finally upgraded my system. Till now I was using a Pentium III computer which has survived well past its shelf life. I was also getting annoyed using that system since I can't watch HD video in it, I can't play some games if I get bored, I can't even multitask since it hangs if I do so. So I decided it is finally time to upgrade my system. And this is it. I assembled the entire rig on my own. I took liberal advice from my Tech Enclave friends to decide upon the components. Here are the individual components. Processor AMD Athlon II X4 620 Quad Core Image Source: bit-tech.net I remember myself hating AMD in the early days since it was dead slow and never performed as advertised (experience from using my friends computer). But what I hadn't realized is that AMD put away all those things behind them and have started delivering better goods for cheap and is right now giving Intel a run for its money. Now my CPU i.e. the Athlon II X4 is a Quadcore processor meaning it has four processors built in one chip. This is the first Quadcore in the market that sells at around 5K. The Intel Quadcore is nearly double or more. I was initially planning on a Intel based system but was blown away by the AMD offering. Here are some reviews about this CPU. AMD Athlon II X4 620: Quad Core For The Masses At $100 AMD Athlon II X4 620 &amp; 630: The First $99 Quad Core CPU AMD Athlon II X4 620 CPU Review After reading all that review I'm sure you can imagine why I switched to AMD. I got it for 5200Rs in Chennai. The CPU doesn't get very hot so the stock CPU fan is enough for cooling it. It's totally unnecessary to waste money on CPU coolers for this CPU. The maximum temperature I have seen is around 40 degree but usually runs at around 32-34 degrees. Motherboard Asus M4A785TD-V EVO Image Source: unitycorp.co.jp Choosing the motherboard was the toughest decision I took while building my rig. For starters I had absolutely no idea about the various technologies involved. The brands, features it was mind numbing. So after hearing the first two or three suggestions from the TE gang, I started exploring those motherboards and their features. Almost all suggested the Gigabyte board, Gigabyte 785GMT-UD2H . This is a micro ATX board meaning a smaller sized board. I had decided to go with this board. When I reached Richie Street I was not able to find this board. Since I was at that time impatient I decided to go with an alternative having the exact same features. Thus I bought the Asus M4A785TD-V EVO. Well the name Asus is not new in the motherboard, infact it is among the top contenders in the market. The highlights of the board are Full ATX board supporting AM3 CPUs , DDR3, IGP (ATI HD4200), 128MB of DDR3 sideport memory, two PCI-e 2.0 slots lots of USB slots and lots more. The real plus point is that I can fit bigger GPUs in the future when I buy one. :) This board is quite heavy and it fills your Cabinet, so make sure you buy a bigger cabinet for this one. This is also the costliest component in my Rig excluding my monitor of course. It cost me 6600Rs . bit-tech.net Review - Asus M4A785TD-V Evo review Overclock3D :: Review :: Asus M4A785TD-V EVO 785G ATX Preview Read the second part of my rig building process <!-- Its hard to come by wallpapers for my E51. So I have started downloading photos and making wallpapers by cropping them and editing to suit the looks. This one is actually a picture of Trisha from her upcoming movie Vinnaithandi Varuvaya. You can use this wallpaper for other Mobiles with 240 x 320 resolution too. <!-- Good|SAM: a short film by Anthony Pierce and Hunter Richards from Hunter H. Richards on Vimeo .

I know For the last two months I haven't blogged at all. So here I am back from the so called busy life. <!-- I am a big time fan of movie posters, that anyone could guess seeing my many posts on movie posters. They are the first thing which either attracts/repels you to/from the movie. So far I had been posting all international movie poster. Well I guess its time to showcase some of the local talents here as well. This poster to certain extent represents the movie's theme. We have a geeky looking Uday Chopra and an apparently ravishing Priyanka Chopra and there is this distance between the two characters, probably to suggest the difference in nature of the two characters. This movie probably takes place abroad which we can assume from the skyscrapers in the background. The butterfly and the flowers are just extras and doesn't add any meaning to the poster. I think this is my first movie poster review :). YAY! The poster doesn't seem to inspire me to go see the movie if it ever releases in Chennai ;). Let the movie release then we will come to know. <!-- Well this is the song I sometimes hear when I drive. Really gets you going :). This song is from Nickelback's 2008 Album " Darkhorse ". <!--
