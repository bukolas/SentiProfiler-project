hey bro,

you have to understand something. our government has basically turned their back on white americans. so here are the questions you need to ask yourself. why do white people hate blacks so much? the answer is simple, crime, poverty, disease, illiteracy, ignorance, uneducation, black slang and last but not least reverse discrimintion. hate to tell you this but 90 percent of interracial crime is black on white. so why is it then that when the majority attacks any minority, even if it's one in ten, that it's a hate
crime? the extreme right are the only ones who stand up against this washington bullshit. so just think about it, i know you've been taught that racists are evil but really think about it. racists people seem to be the only one looking out for your interests and mine. just think my friend.
