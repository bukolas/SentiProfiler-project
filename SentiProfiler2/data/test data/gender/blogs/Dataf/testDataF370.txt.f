Some people fear their first time, but instead they should truthfully embrace it, because it only happens once and is a truly unique experience, because after the first time, it’s no longer something you haven’t done before and will become something you can understand and expect. The moral of the story here is to throw yourself into your first time travels (road trips or otherwise), not to be apprehensive about them, as you will only have one chance at a first time and it’s something to be cherished and enjoyed, not hampered by “what ifs” and other numerous worries. After all, travel is supposed to be rewarding and relaxing, isn’t it?
