OM Shanti Shanti Shanti   You must have gone through some unpleasant, uncomfortable moments in life when you are not FEELING GOOD about things, about situation or about people. Whether its just about salt in food or somebody around you whom you don't want in the moment or you stuck in thick traffic or somebody behaving in a way which is disturbing you or sometime for no reason we don't feel good. The most often what we do we blame others and complain about things or people about the way we feel. And this happen to most of us and most of time without being even aware about it. So what is the way out?   Here is what you can observe. Whenever you are going through some unpleasant feeling. Just give a pause to yourself and obsever what is happening inside? How is the state of your mind? Is it cluttered, agitated, heated up or heavy. In principle this is what is reflecting out (if you not ready to accept this truth say it most of the time ). So when you become aware of this disturbed state mind, just remind your mind to be peaceful and calm right now. If its too difficult give a bigger pause and just tell yourself that you are commited to inner peace, you are peace :) and first become peaceful inside. You will see immediately things will be more clearer.

This I observe after reading Guruji's one knowledge sheet where He says, "Forget about knowledge, God, service any good thing in life, first comes the PEACE. If there is no peace nothing can happen." And to my experience this is so true and striking peace at first place make a tremendous difference. Its so amazing.

So next time you feel any unpleasant moods or moments: give yourself a pause and remind yourself about inner peace and chant inside Om Shanti Shanti Shanti! (Om Peace Peace Peace)

And Share your experiences.
All Glory to Gurudev
