Ever wonder how celebrities get such beautiful, glowing healthy skin? if                                     they're not lucky enough to be born with it, like this Hollywood mother-daughter duo,                  they must have some tricks up their sleeves â€¦ right? Yup.
And though we don't claim to be geniuses or anything, from what we've seen on the red carpet    (and learned from the many skin care experts, celebrity makeup artists and top dermatologists we've chatted with), we know that healthy-looking skin starts before you ever pick up your foundation brush. Before you ever try to cover up those dark circles and red or brown spots (aka sun damage and acne). You must first nip imperfect skin in the bud                                          by first addressing something else: your uneven skin tone.
