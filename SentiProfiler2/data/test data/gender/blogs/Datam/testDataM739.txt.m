I've been recording and posting some brief (for me) monologues on YouTube, starting with Space Exploration Part 1 - Planning our next steps in beyond Earth &nbsp; ... followed by Space Exploration Part 2 - Mining the sky: Are there economic incentives out there? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and then Space Exploration Part 3: The Big Picture, Where is the excitement? And what about warp drive? Finally, and just posted, there is Space Exploration Part 4: Ambitious technologies for space: Space tethers, solar sails and space elevators. More space-related postings will go up soon, plus some fun rants about SETI, andon the (crazy) notion of &quot;cycles&quot; of falling civilizations. Nature interviews David Brin on scientists writing fiction. I was also interviewed for the new documentary &ldquo;The People vs. George Lucas.&rdquo; &nbsp; I have no idea - yet - whether they used their footage of me appropriately.&nbsp; I attempted to be circumspect and speak well of Lucas -- where he deserved it. For example, I loved the &ldquo;Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&rdquo; and adored &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back.&rdquo;&nbsp; So my disappointment in the films that followed came honestly... leading to my participation as editor and &ldquo;prosecutor&rdquo; in the book STAR WARS ON TRIAL . (by far the best and most fun way to explore these issues!) Those guys at the SETI Institute sure have chutzpah!&nbsp; They plan to tun their first SETIcon August 13-15 at the Hyatt Regency, Santa Clara. &ldquo;The Search for Life in the Universe in Science Fact and Science Fiction!&rdquo; Thus perpetuating the myth that they love science fiction.... only don&rsquo;t mention any possibility that the universe might -- just might -- be different, even slightly, than their standard model.&nbsp; Watch how quickly any alternate scenario is dismissed as &ldquo;crazy science fiction stuff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anybody planning to attend? Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it should be fun and interesting in its own right.&nbsp; The topic has fascinated my, all my life and I am glad the are pursuing the worthy search... (as opposed to some of their other, cultlike activities.)&nbsp; But if anyone is interested in some questions to raise.... For more fun stuff, see my regular blog at http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/ Or drop by http://www.davidbrin.com Have fun and explore! This is just a convenient place to post instructions for the members of the FiRe design challenge and their assistants to use during the run-up to the challenge session -- and to help them use the experimental Holocene Conversation System. You are welcome to check out the overall Holocene web site and read about what's incorporated in the patent, which covers a dozen or so innovative ways to help people allocate their scarce attention, online. Many of these methods are natural to human beings in real life, but somehow never made it into web interaction. Till now. But you can skip all that and go straight to the page that is a backdoor entryway, via the address I provided, at tinyurl.com Have a look at the list of features and instructions (maybe print a copy?), then scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the phrase CLICK HERE. IT IS IMPORTANT ONLY TO USE INTERNET EXPLORER AS YOUR WEB BROWSER! SORRY, BUT THIS IS A SHOESTRING INNOVATION. Use the ID and Password provided and enter "brinspace" at the appointed time. You should find others to talk to. The central "facing" controller takes some getting used to. Otherwise, everything is pretty intuitive. Then why did I set up this blog page, as a supplement? We need a place to post (permanently) any links or URLs or other matters that people want to leave persistent. Simply do so in the comments section, below. Have fun! And phone me if you have any problems. David Brin My briefly-run design-challenge show will one last appearance on the History Channel, Friday morning May 2 at 5 am (Eastern and 6am (Pacific). (Sorry to have missed that. It's 3am Mountain and am Central.) Set your Tivo to a wide window, just in case! (See my previous entry for description. Anybody know a likely sponsor? ;-) Or copies can be ordered from the HC web site. -------- Heck, while I'm at it....here are some shocking items. -------- Want the current economic crisis explained? See my friend (and extremely smart world pundit) Mark Anderson offer some unusual insights. -------- Those of you who thrilled to the “big dog” robot video really ought to see the satire . ===AND NOW, FROM THE TRANSPARENCY FRONT=== Turning our gaze upon our paid protectors -- From Boing Boing: NYPD cops videoed illegally warring on photographers: This video compilation of numerous near-simultaneous arrests in NY is a nice example of how consumer technologies can help to balance abuse of authority. A fascinating study in the trend I forecast, of smart mobs holding authority accountable. This is how we'll get truly professional police. And yet... And yet, I have to tell you that I have decidedly mixed feelings. Yes, the lapses in professionalism -- and outright lies -- of the cops deserve nailing. They must learn (apparently with some difficulty) to live in a world of cameras... and rights. Still, the scenes depicted were drenched in the drug high of self-righteous indignation on both sides. There were scores of people in Time Square just itching for a confrontation, heckling, taunting and veering in front of guys who are... at a deep level... just human males high on adrenaline. Yes, the woman who would not show her ID was within her rights. But she could have given them their little ritual of control, and they had already proved that would likely be enough. I want to emphasize, I am on the side of the smart mob. But I would betray this movement if I weren't able to criticize it. These things need to be smarter, calmer, and far more mature. ----- I contributed to Game Development Essentials: An Introduction (and followup volumes.) If you want to develop games... and that's it for now. Andi Tobin wrote in to say "I just noticed The ArchiTECHS is on The History Channel at 5 a.m. on May 2." I have the distinction of having been on the History Channel's top... and bottom... rated shows ever. "Life After People" was a huge success, and I'm still doing interviews about it, phoned in to New Zealand and Australia. History promoted it like mad, but there's also something deeply resonant about a show that portrays the world recovering after humanity somehow blows it. Suits the mood of the 21st Century, so far. In contrast, "The Architechs" was a design show... that "challenged five geniuses to solve an impossible problem in 48 hours... to innovate more than a dozen new fire rescue and evacuation tools for skyscraper disasters." History never promoted the show and aired it one weekday night at 10pm. Well, well. If end-of-the-world sells better than problem-solving, I'll do end-of-the-world! Still, Tivo "The Architechs" if you can. (And tell friends! This may be their last chance.) You may enjoy a little dive back into the oldtimey can-do spirit. A spirit of optimistic problem-solving we might do well to bring back, sometime soon. ---- (Feel free to continue your previous arguments in comments below...) This will be my second blog... one dedicated ONLY to literary matters! THROUGH STRANGER EYES -- a collection of my book reviews, introductions and essays on popular culture -- will soon be released in the Western Hemisphere by Nimble Books and in the Eastern Hemisphere by Altair (Australia). Included will be those infamous articles about Tolkien and Star Wars, sober reflections on Jared Diamond's Collapse, and Rebecca Solnit's River of Shadows, scientific ponderings on Feynman and Gott, appraisals of Brunner, Resnick, Zelazny, Verne, and Orwell... all the way to fun riffs on the Matrix and Buffy!
