Summer vacations are nothing new.. I ve been enjoying them every year. But this time it was different. That was because holidays after twelfth boards is like a never ending pit filled with one element - Boredom. But i realised one thing this summer. Dogs are the best companions of man! I spent all my time pampering two of the most adorable dogs in the world. They re Jeeves and Billiken. Though it was a little irritating now and then , i thoroughly enjoyed myself . They both walked into my lives as mere street dogs but now they mean more than anything else to me. One fine January morning , i spotted a white and brown dog sleeping under a two-wheeler. It looked so much like 'Shengu' ( Our old dog who left us sobbing on the 20th of November, 2005) . We started feeding him and officially accepted him as a part of our family. I was quite obsessed with P.G.Wodehouse's books then , so i named him Jeeves .
