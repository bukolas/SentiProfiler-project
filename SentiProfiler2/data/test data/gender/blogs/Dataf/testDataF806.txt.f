I've found out that my best friend plans to come and visit me for a few days the weekend after Christmas, and additionally, since we aren't going to Florida this year as planned, my family from Merritt Island are going to drive to South Carolina to visit for about a week. I unfortunately will only get to see them for one day since I'm going to be flying to New Jersey to spend a week with my boyfriend and his family for New Years. So much traveling, so little time!
