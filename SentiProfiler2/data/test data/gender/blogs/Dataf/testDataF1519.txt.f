The other day I was so lucky as to be able to spend time at one of my favorite places. It's a place I hope to spend the vast majority of my summer. (Second to work, I suppose, but let's not think about that now) Shortly after arriving, I ran into a friend and inquired as to his well being.

He replied, "Oh, perfect! If I won the lottery, it'd be a step down!" 

I love it. I feel the same way, surrounded by such awesome people in my life.
