i'm incredibly lonely, go figure.

the past year i've spent with you my one and only, fuck. you're still my one and only. so many empty promises left unkept, i don't know how to react.

i'm so unstable, every other minute i'm biting my lip trying to hold back tears. everything doesn't seem to be getting better like everyone's promised.

i'm spending christmas alone. i'm spending my mornings, afternoons, and nights alone. i crave being held, i crave being loved. i crave being the first priority, the first one thought about, the only one wanted.
always second best, seems that's all i will ever be.

i drift through, day by day. trying to see a point in getting ready and standing up for the day. i don't see me having a future, it seems like there's some mental block keeping me from looking forward.

why is it, that no matter who i get close to, there will always be someone better, and more worthy of they're time, energy, and thoughts? am i really just worth that little, that not one person would put me as first?

'no, it's sarah. it's okay to shove her aside. she'll still be around. i can't say no to the other person, because if i do they'll walk away. but sarah, she'll never leave no matter what i do.'

people know i'll stick around no matter how i'm treated, everybody tells me that. they tell me they don't mean for me to end up as their punching bag, but that they need to let it out somehow, and that they know i'll be around regardless. and that i'm 'strong enough' to take it. it rips me apart. maybe i just care more than they do.
maybe i'm just not strong enough to walk away.
