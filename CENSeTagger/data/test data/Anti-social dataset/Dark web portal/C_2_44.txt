Wa Aleikum As-Salaam akhi Yunus-Bek Yevkurov was the president of the so-called 'Republic of Ingushetia', which is part of the North Caucasus, right next door to Chechnya. He led Russian troops in Kosovo, and during the first and second Chechen wars, and was appointed to take over after the last 'president' of Ingushetia (Murat Zyazikov) was pressured to step down in 2008. Since then, he has actively supported the russian kuffar, and facilitated death squads who kidnap and murder innocent muslims. He did survive (so far) the martyrdom operation, by the will of Allah Azza wa Jal. He sustained a ruptured liver, broken ribs, a torn lung, and a severe concussion (maybe to the point of brain damage). Since no one except for pre-screened Russian doctors, his personal staff, and FSB officers have been allowed to see him, no one knows for sure what his condition is.
