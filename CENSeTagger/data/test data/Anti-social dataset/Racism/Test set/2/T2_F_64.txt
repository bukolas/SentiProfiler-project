I guess I need to put myself into the position of a racist again. You krauts think we "chinks" don't know to arm ourselves too? You are assuming we Asians are dumb people which we are not. Think about it, why the black troublemakers always get killed in Asian areas? You think the most intelligent race don't even know to defend themselves? Ok, now I'm back to my true identity. I'm a Asian Hoosier, born and raised in Indiana. My family and all my friends are conservative people. We don't like the troublemakers, regardless to their race. I don't like any racist group, including KKK, skinheads, black panthers, Chinese gangs, etc. I firmly believe that people should be judged by their character instead of the color of their skin, however, I do admit a lot of blacks, quite a few of whites and Asians are troublemakers and I don't like them. I believe in defending my freedom, and I'm not going to let Obama to take the guns away from us. And I don't like to see my uncle who is white, was under racial discrimination while he was applying for a job. He is mostly white with a little bit of Sioux blood, and in order to get the job he had to fill out "multiracial" instead of "white". I was also taught to defend my rights for survival. I'm not trying to lie, but my family is probably one of the most patriotic families in the country. My grandfather was one of the very few Asian American served in the Korean war, my father was in the army during the Gulf War and my brother just finished his basic training in the navy not too long ago. I think according to you logic, my family is so stupid to fight for you white people, ain't it?
