mmm.. just realised the i havent written a post since the dawn of the new year…not good na..i better write one.. but guess wat.. i havent even thought of what to write yet.. and i ve already begun ehh… !! CRAZZY! Hey thats it! i ll write abt being just a touch crazy! doing wacckky stuff! something like this.. being completely spontaneous.. with complete disregard to consequences..! wow! its fun man! just the other day.. some body asked me are u really this crazy or…and stopped mid way after the or..Sometimes i dont understand why ppl ask me such questions.. if i was really crazy did they expect me to answer in the affirmative.. or wat.. Never mind! On the other hand however.. wats wrong in being just a little crazy?? The biggest advantage as I see it is 40 years down .. when u are sitting in an easy chair with 2 yummy looking grandchildren one on each lap..u ll have storiess to tell!! U knoww.. granny was such a naughty thing when she was young.. ! I did this and that and this and that.. and the children will listen to u in awe and say.. myyy granny bestesst in their broken english! wow! priceless! If u bore them with the I was always the seedha-saadha 1st ranker who got a gold medal like stuff.. naaah! buzz off patti is probably all you ll end up getting.
