I've had Ulcerative Colitis for about 16 years, and I'm almost always in a flare up. I just starting using this website, which is wonderful! For the past week, I've been modifying my diet to include mostly anti-inflammatory foods, and I immediately started feeling an improvement. My constant bloating has diminished, and I'm anxious to see how this affects my health over the coming weeks and months. I wanted to know if there is a way to search ND to find foods within a range of IF ratings, for example -- be able to search for highly anti-inflammatory foods, or moderately anti-inflammatory foods. I can see the IF rating when I select a specific food, but it would be great if I could search for a list of foods based on IF rating. Thank you.
