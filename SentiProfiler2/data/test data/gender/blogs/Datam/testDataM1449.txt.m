Today was the Eastern Star School of Inspection here in Ames. Our Instructor (on the right) is Jean who threatened me with a lawsuit if I put her pictures on here. Not to worried about it. On the left is the Secretary of the Board of Custodians and a Past Grand Matron of Iowa. These women have memorized the entire Eastern Star Ritual Opening, Closing, Initiation and they come once a year to sure that the Chapters are doing the work correctly.
