We are leaving bright and early tomorrow morning to visit Aaron's mom for a week. It's going to be super cold, so we were trying to pack appropriately when we both looked at each other and said, "We don't really have any cold weather clothes!" That's what living in a mild climate year round will get you. Ah well, I'm sure we'll be good. Lots of layers, right?

My other concern is of course little girl. I have actually flown with her several times and she's been great, but those were all at 1 yr or less of age, so she was much less mobile and nursing put her right to sleep. I'm not so sure how good she will do now. At least it is a fairly short flight, and Daddy is going too.

Man, they're terrible. And she's not even two yet! But I know most of this is my fault. I give in to her much too often, and now I am suffering the consequences. It's really hard to hold fast when you know you might be in for a 10, 15 minute tantrum and even those only end when you give in and say, "Okay, come here. I can see you need help settling down. Do you want some milk?" She never, I mean never, comes out of a tantrum on her own. At what point is it cruel to be ignoring her?

In any case, if you were wondering what set her off today, 1) Wanting to open the tums she saw when I grabbed a towel from the closet. 2) Wanting to walk in the kitchen where there were broken bits of a bowl I was cleaning up. 3) The dog took his toy that she had grabbed from him. It really is just the small stuff. How can I help my little girl release her frustrations more calmly?? Or is that even possible?
