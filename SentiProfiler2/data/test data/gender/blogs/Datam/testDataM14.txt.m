My youngest brother does not have much of a memory for directions and maps. While this leads to some friendly jibes about his lack of that so-called "manly" trait of the compass in the head, so to speak, it led to me to think about this whole notion of "necessary skills". So when I can look up directions on Google maps from my mobile phone, or have an in-car GPS system give me directions turn by turn and even notify me of traffic conditions, is a sense of physical direction an important skill any more?  I look back and realize that technology trends tend to define what skills are "in" or "out". I have forgotten the art of memorizing phone numbers, because we know share contacts through bluetooth, text messages and missed calls. Come to think of it, I have also lost the unique Indian skill of being able to buy a black ticket at a crowded cinema when the box office tells you that the tickets are sold out. That's because I buy my tickets and choose my seats online now. A few years back, I was part of a technical interview panel for my company, grilling some poor people on the basics of C++ and Java. And since I do not enjoy making people squirm, I left with a very bad taste. I decided then that it made no sense to ask somebody the "difference between overloading and overriding". If I was asked a question like that at a job interview, I would pull out a laptop, connect to the internet and show the interviewer the answer that I pulled up from Google. I fail to see why Indian IT services firms still continue to test people for their ability to memorize Kernighan and Ritchie's memorable tome. Memorization is a skill that's most definitely "out". Information is freely available and searchable. So let's stop testing for information and start testing for knowledge.
