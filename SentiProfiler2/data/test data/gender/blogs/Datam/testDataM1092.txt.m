OK- It's time for my hip replacement. 

As many of you know, after retiring, I joined the circus. Jumbo the Elephant would wrap his trunk around my right leg as I juggled small appliances -- toasters, blenders, coffee grinders. A crowd pleaser, but this probably was the original source of my troubles. When Joey (the human cannon ball) got the H1N1 last spring, circus management asked me to step into the act. The first landings went well, but those sudden accelerations from the cannon applied great pressure to my already weakened right leg. Then, I sort of over shot the landing net -- and well, met some very nice people in the audience. The MRI of my hip, which many of you will receive in our Christmas card, captured the true cost of my fond circus dreams. 

So, I have cancelled my audition for Riverdance and my subscription to Pole Vaulter Monthly. 

And in the prophetic words of Goldie Hawn of Laugh In: Socket To Me.
