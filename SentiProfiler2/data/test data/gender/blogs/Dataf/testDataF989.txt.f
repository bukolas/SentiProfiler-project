"Grass, ah grass." This is but one of the many musings my husband has uttered in his sleep over the years. He has also fought great armies, urging me alongside, and sold God knows how many home improvement supplies. (He works for a home improvement company.) It has been very amusing to listen to him and even try to get him to converse (successfully sometimes)! Sometimes he simply mumbles, and I can't understand a thing!

Well, I don't really know the inception of sleep-talking, but as an educated guess I would say there must be something genetic about it, because in the last couple of months, little girl has been sleep-talking too! Her vocabulary is limited in comparison and she only speaks 1-2 word sentences awake (though she does say over 60 words), so her sleep-talking has been limited to one word per instance. The first time she called out one of our dogs, "Lola!" I checked on her, and was surprised that she was sound asleep. The second was, "Dad!" and then just last night "Close!" First of all, it tickles me that she calls these words out, like she is shouting them to someone. Then the choice of words is interesting. I wonder what she is dreaming about in that little head of hers. . . .
