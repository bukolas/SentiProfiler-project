Get wat u want :) - After a long time, i m bloggin n i wanted to talk on sumthin substantial n sumthin every1 ll relate to..... may b on t lines of ma first blog:)

Ever done things on impulse,without caring for t consequences?
Ever done things out of passion n dedication than compulsion?
Ever done things out of love?

Because wen u do things lik this, irrespective of whether u succeed or lose, there ll b a feeling of satisfaction and peace. may b i m being philosophical, but t truth is tat wen we ve all our heart in sumthin v ll always do it well....

I once watched a documentary called "secret". It s a movie abt "law of attraction"(nw don let yr perverted minds do t thinkin :P ) its philosophical. there s somethinf g profoundly infulential about tat movie, that it changed t way i looked at life.. after tat movie, i was jus transformed. 

Law of attraction s nothin but if u want sumthin, n want it wit all ur heart, imagine u already have it n visualize. u shud visualize in a way tat u can feel its presence in ur life n u already ve it. then t whole world ll conspire in its own ways to make u get it...

Its true... let me quote an instance wen i made this law of attraction work without knowin abt it...
guess it was 2002..don rember wen..champions trophy match,venue was s.lanka-india vs south africa semi final. india was in pathetic position...it was damn sure S.A wud win...bein a cricket freak n fanatic, i badly wanted india to win...
in 34th over i went into pooja room n sat in front of gods n started prayin....i jus said to myself or rather to god- i ll sit here till t end of t match prayin without watchin t match till 50th over but pl make india win...my concentration was so high, i prayed so hard tat i actually visualised india winnin tat match... n u kno wat :) india did win tat match..guess part timers yuvi n sehwag got wickets out of t blue n india went on to win it...

:) try t same in daily life, n there ll b no dearth for joy...jus wish, ask for it imagine u already ve it n u ll damn sure get it... anythin- be it a car or a job or a galfren or a house or money or respect or anythin...sumthin ll happen...world ll adjust accordingly to ur needs.. thats t marvel of t universe...

nw u shudn b a cynic here n ask ll t world tailor itself to each n every1s need..S it ll...it works accordingly, balances everythin...it can synch wit everyone..Thats t power of it...in fact its scientifically proven too...

bcos, wen u implement law of attaction, all u r doin s to create a positive charge around u, a positive feel,joy n happiness...naturally tat positiveness leads to enthusiasm, enthu leads to hope, hope leads to hardwork n hardwrk leads to success... so in essence t universe makes u wrk n it wrks for u.... 

:D Try this once,n if possible try t watch this documentary... cheers ppl
my nxt blog ll b on "The child in us"
