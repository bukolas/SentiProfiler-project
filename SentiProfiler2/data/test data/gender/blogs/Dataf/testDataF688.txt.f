Student teaching is harder than I ever thought it would be. I'm sick to my stomach with anxiety most mornings, and unfortunately, middle schoolers sense weakness so they can prey on it. I also happened to pick a very bad month to stop taking my PMDD medication. I've tested and now I know that it was definitely not a placebo effect that was keeping me happy. I can start taking my "happy" pills again in a few days so hopefully I'll bounce back somewhat. Knowing that I'm not doing as well as I should be with my teaching is also making me more anxious and very depressed and that leads to less than energetic teaching which circles back around to being more depressed and so on and so forth.
