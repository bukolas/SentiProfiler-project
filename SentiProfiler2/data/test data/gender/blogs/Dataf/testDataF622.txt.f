I can't hear you cuz I'm stupid This is going to be a rant. If you're not interested in reading a rant, come back later when I'm closer to a glass half full of the milk of human kindness. I'd like to have a little talk about cell phones. I don't mean how people so often answer them when they're with other people- friends or strangers- and then have the conversation right there in front of us all as if we'd just before asked what they were up to these days. "Oh my, that's such a long story. I know! Listen in on this call and it'll give you a snapshot." I also don't mean the people who use their cell phones at unsafe times. Say when they're crossing the street. Or when they're turning left on a green light and they're supposed to yield but instead, when the phone rings and it's their dad they feel they have to take it so they do and, they drive right into the front of my car and total it. Being nearly a half century old provides one with more than just a sense of perspective, it also means one can remember things. (Okay not everything. And, no, not always where the car is parked at the store as well as what one is to buy at the store. But I know the words and tune to two different versions of "Hound Dog", all three versions of the Free Credit Report dot Com ads plus the Hillshire Farms commercials, and I know that Pure Prairie League performed " Amie ". So it's not like my brain is devoid of all usefull information.) One thing I remember very clearly is how people used phones before there were cellphones. "Yeah, yeah. Most people remember phones before cellphones. We remember early cellphones. Why on the first few season's of 'The X Files' Mulder's cellphone was so big it looked like he was talking into Maxwell Smart's shoe ." I remember when all I really wanted for Christmas was a Princess phone . I remember when my grandmother refused to use her phone during certain hours because she had a party line - which isn't as much fun as it sounds and doesn't cost $5.99 per minute- and she didn't want to interfere with her neighbor's rights and opportunities to use the phone. And I remember how people reacted when they got a long distance call. I didn't know anyone who got a call from overseas; in all the cases I witnessed the participants were four hours or fewer apart from each other. For each instance the behavior was the same: Someone would answer the phone, they'd determine the identity of the caller and who they wished to speak to, then they would turn to that person and hiss, "It's your mother"- if it was their mother- then in a much louder hiss they'd add "Long distance". You're probably wondering why someone would say "long distance" at that point. If you live in Wisconsin and your mother lives in California and she's calling you from there then naturally she's calling you long distance. No one should have to explain the conditions to you in other words. But the phrase "long distance" was not uttered sotto voce for the benefit of the intended recipient of the call. It was a cue to the other people in hearing distance as to how they should behave. Televisions and radios were shut off. Depending on the time of day, children were taken outside or to other rooms where they were shushed. It didn't really matter that these precautions were taken to render the vicinity as quiet as possible. It didn't matter because the first thing the person who was handed the receiver did was...shout into it. "HELLO, MOTHER. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE." Why did they do this? Some of them did it because America was more rural then and they had grown up running and yelling and working and playing outside. They were used to arguing baseball rules across a field and calling people to dinner who were in the back forty. The other reason many people shouted was because this was a long distance call. These were not stupid people. They were leading productive lives. They had most likely not seen the highly informative video "How Your Phone Works" but if they'd thought about it they probably grasped the idea that there were wires running into their house and into Mrs. Avery's house and into Mom's house that carried the conversations. Well if everything is being transported by wires then it doesn't really matter how far away the other person is, does it? There are wires here and wires there and it all works the same whether it's Mrs. Avery down the block or Mom in California. Right? Technically, yes. (Of course it also costs a hell of a lot more to talk to Mom in California and to this day I've yet to have anyone explain that to me in a satisfactory manner.) But in practice, no. The further away the other person was the louder you had to shout. I'm reminded of those earlier headier days of phone usage whenever I'm out in public but especially when I cross the river and visit the more sophisticated city of Portland. Portland, after all, is bleeding edge. Nike is there. IT firms are there. They had a plan to free wi-fi for the whole city . Portlanders know their technology. You can figure I was surprised then when I realized how many Portlanders were shouting into their cellphones. Whether they're leading productive lives or not these people are stupid. This is 2008 not 1968 and I have different expectations for people's behavior and their understanding of how things work. We have all seen enough news stories about overheard/intercepted cell phone calls to get that conversations are transmitted over radio waves and you don't need to shout just because there isn't a wire running out the end of your phone. (If you want to learn about the beginnings of wireless communication- Hey! You might find it interesting- you can read about the Alohanet here.) I don't think lack of knowledge about how cellphones work is what is causing most people to shout into them. I think it's caused by stupidity. I really believe people are shouting into their phones because they're too ignorant to realize they're trying to use the phone in the wrong place. Not wrong because it's offensive although sometimes that's also true. Wrong because there are environmental factors preventing the phone from fulfilling its purpose of enabling communication. You've probably seen these people. (If you were one of these people I doubt you would have read this far.) In an elevator, descending in a parking garage built by someone whose sideline was fashioning fall-out shelters :(spoken loudly) "Yes, I'm on my way to the car now." Another floor down and the thick walls and wiring interfere: (as if speaking to someone who's old or a non-native speaker of English) "I said I'm in an elevator and I'm on the way to the car. Can you hear me? I. AM. IN. AN. ELEVATOR!" One floor below the sign reading "Abandon all hope..." but the phone user hasn't: (in a voice used for calling "Chow's on" to the back forty) "Can you hear me? Hello? Hello! I was in an elevator?" Shakes phone. (This works for remotes and flashlights but I've never seen it work with a phone.) "Screw it! I'll have to drive over and do this in person". But these were not the stupidest people I saw. That dubious honor goes to the folks who were walking beside the Max train talking on their cellphones. They had the phone up to one ear and they would put their fingers in or hand over their other ear- the one closest to the train tracks- in an attempt to block out the noise and continue the conversation. Unless you're negotiating a hostage situation, an organ transplant, or a way to make people stop knitting or crocheting those Martha Stewart "Freedom" ponchos then there is no reason not to stop and continue your conversation somewhere and somewhen else. After all, at this point it seems to be consisting of "Talk louder! I can't hear you! I'm walking beside an effing train trying to shout over it! What? Because I'm completely stupid!" Okay. Maybe that last was really just editorializing on my part. I can't be sure though. It's hard to hear well when you're standing beside an effing train. Quotidian Economics I have recently become friends with one of the young men in one of my computer classes. I'm not sure how young as he says his birthdate is the equivalent of a state secret and he has had to kill people to protect it. On the other hand, he is young enough not to recognize that "Say 'Good night' Dick" is a reference to Dick Martin of "Laugh-In" as opposed to Dick Cavett the talk show host. (Does anyone besides me remember the series of comedy shows Dick Cavett put together for radio? I heard them on the Armed Forces Radio Network but they had to have started out somewhere else first.) , He wears a lot of message T-shirts with sayings on them like "I won't lower my standards to raise yours". He's one of those intense people who feels that everyone should be learning philosophy and that philosophy should be the basis for a civilization. "If only people thought more about what they're doing and why, the world would be a much better place," he told me today. "If people treated one another fairly and ethically, there would be peace and everyone would get along." "Do you know why more people don't study philosophy?" I said. "No." "I took a class years ago that explained that people didn't even consider things like 'What am I doing' and 'Why am I doing it' until society was sufficiently industrialized that it could afford a leisure class. Most people then and I happen to think most people now as well were too busy trying to get by, trying to eke out a living. But then again it depends on what you mean by philosophy, doesn't it?" "Are you saying people are too busy studying economics to study philosophy?" "I'm saying that if you're living hand to mouth and you can barely feed your family or if that's your perception then you're probably not thinking about why you're doing something. One reason you're not thinking about it is that the answer is obvious: you're doing what you can and what you need to do to acquire food and shelter and clothing for the people who are your responsibility. You're not worried about the people outside your circle because it's someone else's job to look after them. During the Irish Potato Famine there were probably very few people sitting around saying, "Does everything work towards the common good in this world?" "That's just it though," he said. "There was no potato famine". It is at this point that- in the words of Lynne Truss- "I start making pointed harrumphing noises". I am pretty familiar with historical revisionists. I once visited the concentration camp at Dachau and the Lyndon Laroushe people had set up a table outside the gates. Clearly they had not been inside the gates because even if you wrote the facility off as an elaborate hoax you would at least have to wonder why anyone would put so much time and effort into staging it. I believe that wondering is only a short nudge from believing and what I saw at Dachau was beyond even the talents of Disney or George Lucas to contrive. "How can you say there was no potato famine? Why would all the historians say there was one and why would all those Irish people have emigrated to American and wherever else?" "There wasn't really a famine. Yes, the potato crop was smaller than usual but there would have been enough for the Irish if they were only supporting themselves. The problem is that the Irish were supposed to be supplying potatoes for all of England too. When the English arrived to pick up the potatoes, the Irish people told them there weren't enough and they couldn't supply the English and feed themselves. The English then took all of the potatoes and the other crops too and the chickens and goats and children to use as slaves and their daughters and packed everything/everyone off to England." "Okay..." "So that's it. If the English had treated the Irish with respect and left them enough food to eat then there wouldn't have been a famine at all." "Right..." "I don't get it. Everybody studies math and science and nobody studies philosophy. Why is that?" "Because you don't make any money with philosophy. We still live in a bottom-line type society. You make money by using math and science to invent or develop something. You don't make money being nice to people and explaining to other people why they should be nice to each other." "I guess that's true. Do you think that's why there's such an emphasis on math and science?" "I'm probably not a good person to ask. When I was in elementary school, we were all pushed as fast and as hard as we could be to learn math and science so we could defeat the Russians. Math, science, and chess." "Oh, the old Space Race thing." "Yes, and we weren't going to beat the Russians by sitting around coming up with ways to be nice. And Bill Gates didn't get to be a billionaire by thirty-one by being nice either. He made a billion dollars and then he started giving it away. Ethics and respect for other people are fine in personal relationships but I've never heard of anyone using them to get ahead. You can be as kind and respectful as you want in your cardboard box under the bridge." The conversation moved on then to why people don't follow Bill and Ted's advice to "Be excellent to each other" and why nearly forty years after the attempted introduction of the metric system it still isn't dominant in American society. "Umm... because we're Americans and we're still a super-power so we'll use any damned measurement system we like and to hell with what the rest of the world is doing" was my take on the reason. In some ways I hate having those kinds of conversations with younger people. I always feel like I'm letting them down and letting myself down as well. I understand that I'm just presenting to them the facts as I've experienced them. (Do I wish things were different? You bet your sweet bippy! I'd love to buy the world a Coke and keep it company.) More and more frequently unless someone asks me specifically I just let them proceed in ignorance. Yes, someone at some point is going to shake them by the scruff of the neck and tell them it's a dirty old world and most people would sell their mother or one of their children to make a buck or to get a carton of cigarettes. But I no longer think it is my job to do the shaking and I would rather do them the kindness of maintaining their innocence as long as possible. Relapse Sometimes when you're suffering from an addiction it seems as if you're the only one and it's kind of nice to find out you're not. Maybe calling it an addiction is too strong. Maybe " obsession " would be better. " Affection " isn't big enough for the things I'm going to be discussing. It's a good word for a phase you'll grow out of like thinking life will end if you don't end up married to Kevin Spacey , Kevin Kline or Les McKeown .( Alan Rickman isn't on that list because no matter how increasingly shabby he looks as Severus Snape he will always be entrancing in " An Awfully Big Adventure ".) People also don't seem to grow out of their desire to own a lot of Sharpie pens . Once you have the regular thickness in all the different colors you can start on the ones with "fine" on one end and "ultra fine" on the other. Sometimes they make good souvenirs; I once bought four of them at a stationery store at the beach and gave them to appropriate people along with their back-story. (Could we have bought the same ones at the Office Max here in town ? No. They would have been the same color but they wouldn't have traveled three hours in a bag with a Cannon Beach sweatshirt and some salt water taffy and that makes all the difference.) It's hard to set someone on the path to Sharpie love though. You can give someone a Sharpie and they will either squee and their eyes will light up or they will say,"Oh. A marker"and it's hard to tell which ahead of time. Another perennial favorite for unpredictable responses- I thought I had grown out of this one but apparently not- is fonts . Not fountains . Not those things they baptize babies and sometimes larger humans in. The typographic kind you find in books, magazines, and web designers' caches. I have not designed in years therefore I had not come into contact with font collections online therefore I thought the danger was past. Then I read " The Principles of Beautiful Web Design " and there was a chapter on typography and even
worse there were links . Now I have three different fonts of various sorts of hearts and a font that looks like stamps and a handwritten font called "Rhiannon" has found its way back onto my computer. Sock yarn , coffee , baseball , books, Sharpie pens, Alan Rickman, jewelry-making supplies , cheese, and now fonts. At least I'm over the guy down the hall. Right? A bit old (and out of shape) to be a home-wrecker Robert Cray did an outstanding song about a couple in the apartment next-door who get into an argument about her being unfaithful. Their disagreement is especially poignant for the narrator because the woman has been unfaithful and it was with him. My situation is a lot less extreme but I want to apologize now to the gentleman who sat beside me yesterday for the long disagreeable night I'm anticipating he had. Especially because the whole incident was completely unintentional. I am not a young person. I have a lot of fun. I usually have a lot of energy. I am wearing an oversized Ichiro T-shirt , rubber flip-flops, jeans that drag the ground, and two rubber bracelets (that support prostate cancer research ) but I don't really look young. I have crow's feet and parentheses and frown lines on my face. More weight than I'd like has moved from my bust to my waist. You get the idea: not young. But even when I was a younger person I never had the problem of girls being upset if I talked to their boyfriends. We were usually talking about cars or sports or Dungeons and Dragons and the girls would give me the once-over and mentally- at least- say "Yeah, right". I haven't expected this to change any time soon. Girls tend to see me as one of the guys and guys tend to see me as one of the guys and that's okay. Whether it makes me one of the guys or not, I love baseball . I don't know when I started to love baseball. I was listening to an audiobook about Spenser and he was reciting the names of the Impossible Dream 1967 Red Sox and they floated to the top layer of my brain like long-forgotten friends. I don't know why my father would have been a Red Sox fan and I would only have been six-years-old when these guys played which makes it very odd I would have the players' names filed away. Clearly baseball has been with me for a long time. (I don't play baseball or softball. My hand-eye coordination sucks and I have either asthma or COPD so at this time I am purely a spectator and commentator.) And if people appear to be spectating with me I will talk to them about baseball. Anyone. And they only have to look like they're the tiniest amount interested in the game. I offer as evidence the fact I once spent twenty minutes explaining to my mother about a ground-rule double. My mother is a) a 70 year old woman, b) only remotely interested in sports and that goes double for baseball, and c) usually doing something else and listening to me purely because I am her offspring. Yesterday evening I attended the Vintage Baseball game held at the Fo rt on the field not too far from the gazebo. They play in the uniforms of and use the rules of the early 1860's. This means no bunting, no sliding, no stealing, no called strikes, no called balls so no walks, and no gloves. Also the ball must be thrown underhand. I arrived at the field with my blanket and my sweatshirt rolled into a ball and was able to find a good seat even though there were a lot of people and the game had already started. I plopped down next to an old man- not being ageist. He was at least seventy-five. Not as elderly-looking as the seeming centenarian who later got hit by a foul ball but still old- who was sitting in one of those very short lawn chairs. I pulled out my BlackBerry, started getting some pictures and trying to understand the rules. I'm not sure if he talked to me first or if I talked to him first. I have feeling it was me and I asked him something like "Do you think those bats are made of hickory ?" My daughter had sent me a link to an article on why baseball bats break and it mentioned that in the early days the bats were made of hickory and since this was supposedly the early days I thought it was a reasonable question. (No, I don't know why I thought he might have an opinion. Maybe because he was an old man and they seem to have an opinion on everything except what they want for their next meal.)He said he thought they might be and we started talking about why bats break and how players like Ichiro who keep their bats in humidity controlled conditions don't break their bats. And then we talked about baseball in general and how the Mariners are doing and whether they will turn out to be the reincarnation of the 1914 Braves and how the Portland Beavers are doing and in between all this talking- which was spread over six innings- we sat in companionable silence that was only broken by exclamations of "Nice hit" or "He batted from the other side of the plate last time. He might want to consider going back to it". The reader can easily gather from this bare-bones recounting of our interaction that nothing untoward was said by either the old man or me. There was nothing, in fact, that could not have been broadcast as "color" during this particular game had there been color announcers at that time or announcers of any kind. I had noticed that every so often the old man would exchange a remark or two with the old woman in the chair ahead of him. A lot of people were exchanging remarks with other people though and the two of them weren't in matching chairs or anything so what happened around the middle of the sixth inning came as a big surprise. (My mother claims it shouldn't have but she wasn't there so it's all supposition on her part.) What happened was that the people directly ahead of me had brought their two children and the kids got increasingly restless and the parents had already bribed them with soda and hot dogs and Cracker Jack and decided finishing the game wasn't worth any further monetary investment. So they left. This was an awesome development for me because I now had an unobstructed view of the field even when I was sitting rather than kneeling. The parents and children leaving wasn't a wholly unexpected event. The unexpected thing was when the old lady called over her shoulder, in the manner of one of the wives on " Last of the Summer Wine ", "Well, now that there's room...I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me." No response from the old man. Presumably he was focusing on the game. "Did you hear me?" The old man's head slowly swiveled from the runner on second trying to decide whether he could make it to third once the ball was struck before the ball bounced. "What did you say?" A bit louder this time- "Now that there's room I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me ." "I suppose I could." "Yes... I suppose you could ." The old man moved up and as soon as he was settled in she left to get a hot dog. By now it was the seventh-inning stretch- no singing, of course, as that portion of the stretch hadn't been inaugurated yet- and I went up to have a better look at some of the bats. Because the old man and I had been discussing them earlier, I said to him as I walked by in search of my own hot dog, "He said his bats are made of white Ash wood and there was no weight limit but there was a circumference limit and the length limit was 42". Can you imagine how tall you'd have to be?" "You'd have to be a basketball player! No limit for weight though?" "No limit on what?" asked the old woman returned from her successful mission. "No limit on weight," he said. "Hmm..." she said. It was very apparent now that I was the third wheel on a tandem although she was displaying as much interest in the whole topic as my mother had in the ground-rule double and I departed on a hot-dog recon of my own. When I came back to the game I sat facing the other side of the field. I hadn't seen the action from over there and I thought it was the better part of valor even though it had never been my intention to cause trouble. But why was there going to be trouble? I had no interest in hooking up with the old man. He was a nice enough old man with some good baseball stories to tell but even if I were looking for a sugar daddy he didn't look like he had the makings of one. And if I were an old woman I can't imagine why I would be jealous of my old man talking to someone like me. No one would consider me trophy wife or girlfriend material. I hope the old man didn't get in trouble. I hope he had a good time watching the game. And I hope this experience doesn't put him off talking to other people. They could learn a lot from him. Even if all they talk about is baseball. Now I've got the pill My doctor looked at me from under her straight-across black bangs, her eyes serious behind her silver wire-framed glasses. "The fact is your cholesterol is sky-high , my friend." "Yeah, well I'm cutting back on the cheese like the nurse said." The doctor's hair swayed as she gave her head a quick shake. "Your cholesterol is so high I can tell there's no way you're going to be able to bring it down with a low-fat diet. I'm going to put you on Zocor ." Ah, the old good news-bad news situation. The good news is since we're not going to try to reduce the cholesterol by cutting the fat I can still enjoy cheese (occasionally). The bad news is- with the exception of the mental anguish caused by contemplating a life without cheese - I was a lot more comfortable with the idea of lowering my LDL by diet and force of will than taking another pill. I am thankful that someone invented this pill and it's going to help prevent atherosclerosis and a possible heart attack . Don't get me wrong about that. But I've been adding more and more pills to my life in the last few years and Zocor like Prozac is going to be something I'm on for the foreseeable future. (In the interest of full-disclosure, when I received my first prescription for Prozac two years ago I was extremely happy. It's goofy, I know, but I am very proud of my identity as a trailing Baby Boomer and in my mind having to take Prozac solidified my membership in that group . A doctor later diagnosed me as having an "attachment disorder" which essentially means I have a hard time accepting that we're all getting older , my child is going to go to college then off to start her own life , my parents are eventually going to die, and even more eventually so will I and the world will just continue on as if none of these events amounted to a hill of beans. Aside from personally finding this line of thought depressing as hell , I think most Baby Boomers have suffered or are now suffering from some form of attachment disorder. Come on... The only way you can unironically say, "Never trust anyone over thirty" is to ignore the fact that someday you'll be there yourself .) Besides- and this is probably the crux of the issue- Zocor is something my pop takes. And he's diabetic . And seriously overweight. And seventy-one. What the hell am I doing having to take the same medication as him? The short answer is it's his fault. Actually it's his parents' fault. Okay, it's probably their parents' fault too. In other words, I'm one of those cholesterol from " apple pie and Grandpa Si " people just like in the commercial. Come to think of it, most of the people on his side of the family suffered from some form of anxiety or depression too. As I look at the state he's in and consider whether his fate might be my own in twenty-five years, it appears having an attachment disorder and- as my mother puts it- railing against the advance of the years might not be a bad idea. The title of this entry is taken from a song by Loretta Lynn . She was filled with unalloyed joy at getting the pill because it was, in fact, The Pill . i'm not lovin' it We've had a bit of a heat wave this week and with that and the price of gas being so high we've all been driving as little as possible. That's why even though my mother wanted fruit and yogurt parfaits from McDonalds she hesitated to text me to ask if I'd stop and get some. I arrived at her house around ten after ten and she made the request in person. I said, "Sure" cuz I don't mind driving when it's hot; I put the windows down and turn the radio up and everything's fine. Our local oldies station is playing their way through their library from A to Z and it's been fun discovering and rediscovering songs. So I absolutely did not mind making a Mickey Ds run. Until I got there. You probably noted the time I arrived at Mom's- even if only subconsciously- and you probably know that McDonalds stops serving breakfast at 10:30. (I don't know why 10:30 is the magic time but it appears to be universal except for Jack In The Box .) So I pulled quickly into the drive-through lane and looked at the clock and it was 10:20 and yes that's damn fast driving but please don't snitch me off. I ordered the six fruit and yogurt parfaits and the Sausage McMuffin with no meat and the iced coffee and since it was now 10:22 I put in my order for the three Filet O' Fish sandwiches. "We don't start serving lunch until 10:30." "Okay." "It's not 10:30 yet so you can't order the sandwiches." "I don't think I'm understanding this right. Are you telling me I can order all the other stuff now but I have to come back through to order the fish sandwiches even though 10:30 is only eight minutes away?" "No lunch until after 10:30." I pulled up to the first window and gave someone the money then I drove to the second window and received six fruit and yogurt parfaits and a Sausage McMuffin with no meat. Then- because I have clearly been beaten down by years of bureaucrats . I parked and sat and enjoyed the moderately pleasant breeze and listened to the radio until...10:35. At which time I got back into the drive-through lane, ordered iced coffee and three Filet O' Fish sandwiches, pulled up to the first window, gave someone my money, pulled up to the second window and waited. I waited sixteen minutes for them to finish cooking some "fresh" fish for me. Are you seeing the irony in this timing? Later my mother said, "You can't blame them; it's how they're trained." I do understand that. I'm not talking about blaming anyone. I also comprehend that there are occupations which call for precision. If someone was say wiring my house I'd want them to pay exacting attention to the codes. Same goes for someone performing surgery on me or someone I love. And, yes, if you start making exceptions for one person then theoretically everyone else will want to order their Filets O' Fish early. That's "theoretically" because I've never seen the world start down the slippery slope to Hades when I've made exceptions and other people do it so seldomly I can't claim to have enough experience to draw a conclusion. It's just like that poem by Charles Bukowski. I enjoy being the girl Many many years ago when computers took up a whole room and John Denver was popular (and alive) and Mt. Saint Helens had yet to erupt, I took computer classes. I studied Basic and Fortran and played Dungeons and Dragons and spent hours working my way through the caves of the Adventure game. In January of this year, I started taking computer classes again. I had already spent over a hundred hours beta-testing interactive fiction a few summers ago. I had spent many happy afternoons singing folk songs. (And even writing some songs of my own). I had not resumed my playing of D&amp;D but otherwise I guess you could say my re-enrolling in computer classes was just the next step in my progression. Most of my classes have a mix of males and females in them. That's different. Ten years ago I took a class in Microsoft Office applications and there was only one male; the rest were women in their fifties and sixties who were only there because their boss made them be and were terribly afraid to shut down the computer for fear the data would disappear as soon as it left the
