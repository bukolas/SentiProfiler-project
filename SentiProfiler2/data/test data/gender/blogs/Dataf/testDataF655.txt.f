The last week was all over the board for me. Every time I thought I had it under control again, it wriggled free, kicked me in the shins and ran away laughing. I hate weeks like that, but they offer perspective too. At one point, today, after feeling particularly "Monday" in attitude, it occurred to me how much better this Monday is than the last one. It was while I was playing (eternal) catch-up on some blog reading. I was reading Cass Just Curious . Her blog is special. Something about the way she writes--and the photos, oh the photos!--just...speaks to me. I felt lighter. Perspective is a funny thing. We're so entrenched in what's happening Right Now, that sometimes we forget how much and how often things can change. A bad day today doesn't -have- to mean a bad day tomorrow. Or a bad week as the case may be. Last week is in the books. This week, I'm going back to being sunshiny. 1. First movie quote to pop into your head right now: Reporter at Spring Training: Where do the Sox rank in terms of importance in your life? Ben: I say the Red Sox... sex... and breathing. (Fever Pitch) 2. What was your fourth grade teacher's name? Mrs. Raap. 3. Have you ever been to Denver? Only if being in the airport counts. And that was also one pain-in-the-rear airport. It's one long strip, which means if your gate numbers are far apart, they are -really- far apart. 4. What is your favorite movie whose title begins with the letter C? Maybe "Coyote Ugly"? 5. What do you think is one of the worst television shows ever created? Not counting reality shows... (I'm sure I will be crucified for this) LOST. I hate tv shows that hurt my brain to watch them. 6. What do you recommend? Not catching the Norovirus. And if someone does catch it, bleach everything you own. If you can't bleach it, Lysol III it. Take my word for it. And if you don't take mine, take Troy's. 7. What is your favorite kind of nut to snack on? Cashews. Unless I'm at a ball game, then peanuts. -In- the shell. (But not boiled peanuts. Yuck.) 8. What kind of wedding did you have--or if you've never been married, what kind of wedding do you dream of having? I used to want the fairy tale. Now? ::shrugs:: I want the one that means it's real. I guess that means I grew up...? 9. What is the most beautiful place you have ever seen? The Catskill Mountains in the Autumn. Or Fenway Park. 10. What color are your toenails painted? ::hangs head in shame:: They aren't. It's not sandal weather for me quite yet. I promise they are properly groomed though! 11. What's the last thing you ordered online? Daniel's birthday gift. I got him a "official" Belichick hoodie. 12. By noon, Iâ€™m usually: Half-starved. I eat breakfast early so I am always very ready for lunch. 13. What is your favorite kind of gum? Extra Wintergreen. 14. What color "grass" in the Easter basket? Green! Preferably made of pale green paper. That plastic stuff is maddening. And I have always hated all the random colors. Who ever heard of bright pink grass?? 15. What's for dinner tonight? I had some pasta & some broccoli. I didn't feel much like cooking, so I went easy. 16. What is the last spice you used when cooking? Ummm... I didn't cook much last week, what with the getting over The Ick & all. And what I did make wasn't very spicy. I'm going to guess it was Montreal Steak Seasoning some time the week before last. 17. How many varieties of mustard are in your refrigerator right now? Just one. Grey Poupon Dijon. There will likely be a second coarse grain variety in there later this week. I need that one specifically for a recipe on the menu. 18. Zoo or museum? I love a good museum...but I get to feed giraffes at the zoo! I can't choose. It's just too hard. You're going to have to pick for me. 19. Favorite cracker? Anything wheat really. I like the flavor of it with cheese. 20. Which item from your wardrobe do you wear most often? My jeans. I wear a pair almost every day. yeah. so. ahem. first, i had some...stuff going on. then, i was at WDW with K . and again, adding Brandi . -then-, i had The Ick. (i'll spare you the details. i'm nice like that.) (sorry, if you "really" know me, because you didn't end up so lucky on the sparing of the details.) somehow that took over a little better than a week (??) and... ...now, i'm playing catch up. and apparently neglecting the blog in the process. i'm going to get my act together soon. cross my heart. photo of me courtesy of Brandi . we fed giraffes at the Lowry Park Zoo! yay zoo! 1) candle scents i burned this month: Sparkling Pine. Balsam &amp; Cedar. Mistletoe. Creme Brulee. Mountain Pine. Sparkling Cinnamon. Red Apple Wreath. Sparkling Angel. Hazelnut Coffee. Lakeside Birch. 2) what i am reading this month: i've had to put my other books on hold for the moment, while i focus on this whole " Bible in 90 Days " project. i am determined to succeed and i have to be honest, sometimes it takes a lot of brain power to get through twelve pages. (hello, books of Numbers, Deuteronomy and Leviticus!) i'm on track though! 3) top three songs i was drawn to: "Edge of Desire," John Mayer. "I'd Rather Be With You," Joshua Radin. "Some People," LeAnn Rimes. 4) movies i saw: Edge of Darkness. (not to be confused with "Edge of Desire" from number three. NOT.EVEN.CLOSE.) 5) favorite tv moments of the month: hearing The Star Spangled Banner play every time the U.S. won a gold medal. watching Evan Lysacek skate in the Men's Figure Skating competition with the same passion i love to see in my favorite baseball &amp; football athletes. the " Jacksonville " episode of Fringe: holy jaw-dropping wow. " Valentine's Day Massacre " (Grey's Anatomy): i'm loving the MerDer storyline this season. 6) something yummy i made: i've been baking fresh muffins for my mid-morning snack at work. apple spice. triple chocolate chunk . blueberry streusel. -yummy-. 7) restaurants where i ate: Rainforest Cafe. Longhorn Steakhouse. Macaroni Grill. Wine Exchange. 8) something that made me cry: that Canadian figure skater, Joannie Rochette, when she skated her short program a few days after her mother's sudden death. so much emotion and strength. i'm pretty sure it was impossible to watch her skate that program & not at least blink hard a couple of times. 9) a goal i had for this month: to start walking again after work. the weather has not cooperated with this goal. i -want- to walk, but i refuse to do so in the cold rain, so it didn't happen consistently. 10) this month i looked forward to: pitchers &amp; catchers reporting to Ft Myers. it's a long cold lonely three weeks between the Super Bowl and the start of Spring Training. 11) something that made me laugh: giraffe tongues. seriously. feed a giraffe some time & you'll see what i mean! 12) a photo i took this month: and a bonus photo, because i just couldn't choose! I am thinking... that this week is going to take forever. I am thankful for... flannel sheets. From the kitchen... will come roasted red potatoes and green beans with a rosemary butter sauce. the chicken will be from the grill. ;-) I am wearing... jeans and a navy blue button-down shirt. and my brown heeled boots. I am creating... a plan for the Disney parks this weekend! I am going... to meet K in FOUR DAYS!! I am reading... the Bible. in 90 days. it's challenging! I am hoping... i'm right. (sorry. no elaboration.) I am hearing... snickers from the office behind me. working with boys makes me shake my head. a lot. Around the house... is a big empty spot where Brandi 's Christmas gift was hanging out until Sunday when i saw her. i had to DUST.IT.OFF before i put it in my car. that's just sad. and really funny. One of my favorite things... is chatting with a wonderful friend &amp; being completely baffled how long you've actually been friends, because even though it feels like you always have been, you know that isn't the case! (this doesn't count for Heather because we've known each other since we were three, which is easy to remember because we met in nursery school. i really have known her forever!) i think it's a sign you truly click with another person when it just feels like you've always been friends. A few plans for the rest of the week... going out to dinner for Troy's birthday on Friday. and then WDW! with K all weekend (and Brandi too on Sunday)!!! A picture to share... Brandi and i went to the zoo on Sunday. we fed giraffes. giraffes have -really- long tongues. they can chase you with them if you have a cracker that they want! this leads to laughter. a LOT of laughter. they also don't like to take turns. they will try to swipe the cracker you are attempting to feed to another giraffe. and they can be sneaky about it since their tongue allows them to do this from like a half mile away! we also watched some storks of some sort bullying some pelicans. pelicans make this really loud honking sound. it's startling if you don't know this in advance! and the storks click their beaks really loudly. you wouldn't think this was terribly intimidating, but the pelicans would disagree with you. then again, i'm pretty sure i wouldn't hang around if a stork was clicking at me either. that beak is pointy! ;-) animals entertain me a great deal, in case this was not obvious to you. yay zoo! ----------------------------------- adding some photos from the zoo post-stream-of-consciousness. this orangutan was so funny. he was trying to nap but the sun was too bright! this little series goes hand in hand with my stream of consciousness! i had to share this one just to ask what the HECK is going on with my hair here?? i couldn't catch it in action, but these sting rays were actually coming up out of the water, begging for food! (it's an interactive tank.) 1. What current tv comedy is your favorite? The Big Bang Theory . it makes me laugh so.freaking hard. 2. Who is the fourth person on your cell phone's "missed calls" list? BrightHouse, calling to sell my faster internet. they were promptly ignored because at the time, they couldn't get the internet i was already paying for to work. i had less than zero intentions of spending more money for faster internet that still wouldn't work. 3. What kind of weather do you enjoy the most? March in Florida weather, which is much like Autumn in New England, minus the foliage: warm days. cool nights. gentle breezes. minimal humidity. sunny skies. and down here, March also brings orange blossoms. i'm pretty sure if heaven has a scent, it's orange blossoms. 4. I want something to drink. What's in your refrigerator right now? pineapple juice. cranberry juice (the pure unsweetened kind. none of this sissy, watered-down, sugared-up cranberry "juice" cocktail nonsense!). water. Pepsi. 2% milk. 5. You're planning a trip--money is not a concern--do you opt to travel by plane or take a road trip instead? road trip!! as long as i don't have to do the driving. ;-) 6. What is your favorite movie whose title begins with the letter H? it's a photo finish between "Hitch" and "Home Alone." 7. Do you enjoy cookouts? i do. sometimes nothing is more tasty than a burger or a hot dog right from the grill. 8. What was your sixth grade teacher's name? Mr Ryskowski. 9. Where did you live in 1987? Bristol, Connecicut. 10. What's the "right way" to read a magazine? flip through it once quickly, making note of any articles you want to read more carefully later. then go back & read said articles. then remove anything you wish to save for later reference (recipes, decorating inspiration, gift ideas). then recycle! 11. What would make today a better day? knowing it would be followed by Monday off. i would also settle for whatever it is i am allergic to being done blooming. 12. What was the last song to get stuck in your head? hmmm... it's been a while. long enough that i cannot recall. this is NOT an open invitation for you to implant yours in my head!! 13. Did you inherit your eye color from a family member? both of my parents, as well as my paternal grandfather, all have (or had, in the case of my Gramp) blue eyes. 14. Do you like fireworks? i do. i especially like the ones that "sparkle" at the tips. (man, i wish i could describe them better than that!) 15. What is your preferred outdoor temperature? 75 degrees. (but without the humidity!) 16. What three professions would you like to try for a day? See's Candies quality control test sampler. assistant to a wedding or infant photographer. Christmas elf (what?? sounds like fun!). 17. What do you do when you're stuck in traffic? turn up the music & sing along. not much else you -can- do. 18. Who was the last person you know who got married? Alison. July 2009. 19. Name three things that are overdue right now. sending Alison the photos i took at her wedding. a birthday card for my father's wife. the arrival of Spring weather in Florida. 20. If your mood were a weather forecast, today would be: bright blue clear skies & a lot of sunshine. it actually looks like Winter (well, like November in Connecticut anyway) down here this year! --------------------------- i saw the coolest post on the blog, "your wishcake," and thought it would be a lot of fun to incorporate it into my weekly Slice of Life posts. it's up to you, readers! what slice of my life would -you- like to see photographed &amp; shared here in the future?
