It's kind of funny how everything in life can alter itself so instantaneously. I've felt so beat-down and broken for the past few days that it's not even funny; and seriously, I don't even care anymore. Everything that has happened to me recently and everything that will continue to happen to me as a repercussion of those recent events, I will endure and overcome. I believe that it's all happened for a reason. I'm stronger and smarter than half of the stupid fucks that surround me and I'm done dealing with their shit. I think the outcome of all of this will prove to be advantageous as long as I look at everything in the right state of mind, stray from the negative, and do things to better myself rather than give two shits for other people. I just can't believe that it's taken me since July to realize it.

I no longer need to engross my mind with senseless bullshit brought on by other people. I don't want or need a friend that's going to be over-dramatic and have a blood and thunder attitude all the time. Especially if all she/he does is try to make me feel jealousy, tries to make me feel like I'm worthless, and tries to make me experience guilt for things that aren't of my own doing –or even issues with any sort of validity for that matter! I don't need to feel detestable because people don't feel the same way about me anymore, whether it be a girlfriend, friend or an acquaintance. Are you done with me? Have you had enough yet? Perfect then! I'm fucking finished with you and I realize now that I have been for a while! It's time for me to move on. I feel like I need change again. I can't handle this cut of situations by the same means and methodology that I used to deal with them –depression, hostility, frustration, violence, rage… It gets really old really fucking fast. I'm done with the conflict. I'm done with the brawling. I'm done with holding myself down with everybody else's problems. Count me the fuck out. It's time I live my life for myself and for nobody else.
