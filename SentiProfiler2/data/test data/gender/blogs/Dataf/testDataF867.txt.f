I always pictured life like the movies. But i have realized that movies are not the source. They are unrealistic and dreamable. I wish that life were like the movies because there is always a happy ending! (sometimes). All the best movies are the ones that are realistic like Juno and all the ones that are based on true storys. hehe
I believe that life can be like movies. It's rare but it can be the same.Waiting with Angela

Just siting here waiting for my tutor to come. today is a short day in school and My tutor doesn't know that. So i have to wait another 10 minutes for his arrival. hehe. I had tutoring with him with just me but now Angela is joining in. Shes in Geometry im in algebra. I know. How is that gonna work out? Well i guess he can multi task. Thats good. Because now i have more time to do problems without half pressure.
