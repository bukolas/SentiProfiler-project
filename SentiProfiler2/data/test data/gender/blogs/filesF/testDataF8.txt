I love Sushi!  The only problem I run into is that my husband is not a fan so I am typically eating sushi as carry out and delivery.  The rolls arrive as fresh as they are if you are lucky enough to have them at the restaurant.  Coast is a great dinning experience either at home or there.  When I do actually get to the restaurant I love to go with girlfriends and share rolls and a bottle of wine.  It is byob but no corkage fee so it actually makes going out for a sushi dinner affordable.
To be honest, the only car rental company I've used is Enterprise, but I wouldn't want to use another company because their service is excellent. Their slogan, "We'll pick you up", is the absolute truth. Every time I've needed to rent a car, for whatever reason, they've cheerfully shown up on my doorstep. In the age of mediocre customer service, it's going above and beyond the call of duty. Their cars are clean, inside and out, and well-maintained, and if a car might have a scratch or ding, it's noted.
If there was anything more terrible than Rena Riffel’s attempt to create a Showgirls sequel, it was the German filmmaker (I use the term loosely) who did it first and is causing an internet phenomenon about just how bad it is.But when Rena Riffel (an actor who played one of the dancers in the first film) came out with her teaser for a film that hasn’t been made (with a drag showgirl and embarassing acting) the Marc Vorlander decided to make a public statement that really doesn’t help his cause.
I recently received a couple of Elizabeth Arden’s new, very covetable, eyeshadow compacts.
Color Intrigue Eyeshadow Duos come in an elegant compact printed with an inspiring quote from Elizabeth Arden: “To be beautiful and natural is the birthright of every woman.”While the compact itself is certainly worthy of beauty lust, the eyeshadow inside makes these duos worth buying.I reviewed Color Intrigue eyeshadow before and I’m a fan of the product’s beautifully smooth, blendable, crease-free formula.I tried two of the duos, both of which are ultra-wearable and will flatter most skin tones. “Autumn Leaves” is a silky matte duo that pairs a warm shade of peach with the perfect shade of cocoa brown.
You could be about to give birth and a representative from the Guiness Book of World Records requests to document it. Your credit card could have accidently registered a payment of $10,000 you don't have. You could be stuck in an elevator in Brooklyn WITHOUT alcohol.
I used to use this airlines a lot when I lived in Long Beach.  They were veyr down to earth and very conscious of giving quality service. Not quite as cheap as Southwest and I only regret that they don't fly into LA more often but for what it is, it's a good airline.  I love the TVs by every seat too. It really came in handy on the red eye flight to New England.
Yes, roses and chocolates are lovely gifts for your Valentine—maybe a bit obvious but romantic nonetheless. If you're looking to be a little less transparent—and you're willing to spend a bit more money (isn't she worth it, after all?)—then check out these Valentine's Day gift ideas. We've rounded up a bunch of gadgets—available in pink and/or red—that will surely put a smile on her face. Why not say "I love you" with a ruby red digital camera or "I like you a lot" with a hot pink iPod nano.
This review is for Maybelline's new mascara, Lash Stiletto. I purchased this mascara, in the hue Very Black, from Wal Mart about a week ago and have proceeded to use it every single day since then. My Lash Stiletto  purchase came with a bonus waterproof liquid eyeliner, in black, at no extra cost. The total for this duo came up to about 7 dollars, which I believe to be a very good deal considering the impressive quality of this product. The price will be different in various parts of the country, but from what I understand, Lash Stiletto by Maybelline usually runs between 7 to 10 dollars.The actual mascara "tube" is very eye catching and cute. Modeled after the heel of a stiletto, Maybelline make an interesting play on this product's name.
With Easter almost on it's way I wanted to be sure that I made some beaded eggs this year. So I thought what better way to use up some of my Bead Stash. I used the flower motif for one and added some daisies. The other is just free form. I do still want to make a few more before Easter if I find the time, but here's a couple of them for starters.
I'd never laid fingers to a MAC before my husband purchased two for us last month. I've been a loyal Gateway customer until the last one started crapping out a year before the 3 year extended warranty was up, and they gave me problems about fixing it. I said "no more!" and started looking at the iMAC. I love it! Easy to learn, easy to use, so many options, and I can still use Microsoft Office on it, which is important to me, because I do work that requires Word.
I had a very bad experience at the Framingham, Massachusetts Enterprise at 298 Worcester Road. My experience at the location at 1701 West Hillsboro Boulevard in Deerfield Beach, Florida was so outstanding I have to rave.
My mom had a fender bender so her car was in the shop. When I arrived in Florida I called Enterprise. She had already contacted them because it went through her insurance company. When I called they said they’d have Wayne are our condo within 20 minutes. Five minutes because Wayne arrived he called to let us know he was close by – and right on time.
Real school starts on Wednesday. I am excited but nervous about that too. I am still scrambling to put together my class on modernist poetry and just decided to have a course website for the first time ever. One reason is swine flu (we're supposed to make it easy for students to keep up from home so that they don't spread their piggy germs around) but really I just want to be able to add online readings throughout the quarter instead of choosing everything now.
I really am getting excited to get on the plane and start my journey. Yesterday I confirmed my hotel, decided with City Motel. Today was a challenging day, started out with the Then went on to start my day of prenatal visits, unfortunately when I stopped to grab a coffee and pressed the window down button to get my parking ticket- when ugh my car window goes slamming into the door. mild 4.4 earthquake which jolted me upright in bed, and made me go - yep I've been a way from California for a while.
I flew on Jet Blue this summer with a group of teachers. I had heard a lot of bad things about Jet Blue and was hesistant to fly with them. The flight was booked through a trip coordinator so I had no day in the matter.
I was so pleased with the service, the plane and the flight in general I would love to fly Jet Blue whenever possible. There was a wide variety of snacks to choose from and the flight attendants were very efficient.
Oy, what a weekend! We headed up to the general Seattle area on Friday for the Seattle Kennel Club dog show. Kim was super nice and let us stay at her house again. Once we got the dogs and ourselves settled in, we had a few glasses of wine and chatted for a bit. I had been forewarned that this show tends to be a bit of a zoo. There's a fair amount of promotion done for the show to encourage spectators (I have a strong suspicion it has to do with the fact that they charge admission for this show) and that creates a few issues for the exhibitors that I was about to witness first hand the next day. But first, I have to explain our lovely sleepless night.
It was another late arrival home today, so I ended up taking my walk after dinner rather than prior to it, grabbing the camera with the 18-55mm lens on my way out the door. I wanted to get a couple of photos of the downed trees from the storm we had over the weekend. It was NOTHING like the bad weather that my friends in CT experienced. We didn’t lose power here. Below is the old cherry tree that split the lilac in half last year. Can you tell my heart is still broken over that lilac bush?
I've found out that my best friend plans to come and visit me for a few days the weekend after Christmas, and additionally, since we aren't going to Florida this year as planned, my family from Merritt Island are going to drive to South Carolina to visit for about a week. I unfortunately will only get to see them for one day since I'm going to be flying to New Jersey to spend a week with my boyfriend and his family for New Years. So much traveling, so little time!
I have delivered both of my children at Evanston Northwestern Memorial Hospital. One of them I had naturally with forceps, the other via emergency c-section. While personally the experience was mixed, I was generally happy with the hospital and the overall facilities.
I have made coffee with everything from Bunns to pots boiling on the top of the stove, but the Capresso is the only Coffee Maker that gives me true and well flavored coffee exactly as I want it to taste. The whole thing is done in a flash with minimal work on my part and it is ready before you know it. Setting the timer the night before, I know that in the morning I will have a fresh pot of coffee sitting there waiting for me, just the right flavor and just the right temporature. I pour a cup and savor the flavor of the best coffee ever made in this house.
Thai Airways made the almost 20 hour flight from LA to Kathmandu, Nepal as comfortable as possible.  The beautiful fabric on the plane's seats and the colorful, "uniforms" worn by the gorgeous flight attendants put passengers in a Thai state of mind as soon as they step on the plane.Passengers are given a choice of 2 Thai meals and everything was delicious.  Meals were served on china with real silverware, even in coach.
Well, first of all, I have been sick with some sort of nasty combination of an upper respiratory infection and a sinus infection...it literally put me out of commission for about 2 weeks. I went to the doctor twice - the first time he told me to take over the counter cold medicine and drink hot tea. The second time, about a week and a half later, when I went again because I was getting worse and worse, he finally gave me antibiotics. I started feeling better within a day or two but then felt nauseous for the next few days due to the antibiotics. Now I'm finally feeling better and no longer feel like I'm going to faint while trying to work, which is always nice.
Parents are probably the most interesting and the most annoying couples on this Earth. I think they act in such bizarre ways to get noticed by their aging offspring. I would gladly acknowledge my parents in a friendlier manner more often if they weren't so strange all the time. I don't know if they think because I'm a teenager they need to be "cool" but I would prefer them not try at all becuase I'd rather see their genuine selves.
I'm starting to realize that my mom and dad aren't just the people who have raised and taught me specific morals and lessons in life but they are also people who have thoughts and opinions. I would really love to hear what they think about certain topics but they just don't let this wall down so all I really get from them are lessons on what is good and what is bad. My parents and I have a good relationship, don't get me wrong, but I want to talk to them like they are just regular people.
I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone who wants a great out-of-the-box, easy to use, reliable option that is also great looking. I have had my computer for a couple of years now and it's the best computer I've ever purchased. It doesn't become obsolete the minute I take it out of the box and (knock on wood) I've not had any problems with it since. The screen is big and very beautiful. I love looking at pictures and creating movies and slide shows with my daughter's pictures for family and friends to watch. It's easy to do, even for this computer-challenged user.
I have been remiss. But the title of this post is not an apology. OH NO. It is the repeated phrase that follows any sort of instruction that I give my sage 4-year old. The good news is that sometimes he follows it up with "I was supposed to...(insert instruction here)" and then does it. I choose to take this as a positive sign that a) he is miraculously listening, and b) he can accurately read my strong desire to toss him out of a window and diffuse it. Sort of. This is pretty much the only way that 4-year olds are awesome...unless you count creating an unbelievably enormous pile of crumbs under their chair at the dinner table and then falling OFF OF THEIR CHAIR and into it during the meal. Maybe several times.
I wish I knew more about the situation. I wish the DR and Nurses were a little more concerned, but at the same time they are not and maybe that is a good sign that it really is not going to be that big of a deal, if it turns out to be anything at all. I wish Elko had more resources. I wish my mom was here with me. I wish I could research through the internet until I was satisfied.
Before you make any pre-judgements about Animal Planet ordering a reality show about Mike Tyson and pigeons, let's take a look at some the titles that make up their current programming roster; Animal Precinct, Monsters Inside Me, Jessica the Hippo and Pit Bulls and Parolees. Now with that frame of reference, is "Mike Tyson Playing with Pigeons" really that bizarre?Actually the current working title of Animal Planet's Mike Tyson pigeon racing project is Taking on Tyson.  Not what I would have gone with, but that's probably because for me, the real draw is racing pigeons not Mike Tyson.
why do people think it's a good idea to get drunk off your keister in the middle of the week on a work/school night? I wear green regularly in my rotation of outfits and cosmetics, but since I wore green today, people kept asking me what my exciting plans were tonight. Or they told me it doesn't matter that I have to get up early and work with children in the morning. Or they just smiled and winked when I said I'm running errands and going to bed early. I have no desire to get drunk for the sake of being drunk on green liquors.
My picky eater of an English Bulldog LOVES this food! Plus it's made specifically for his breed.
His coat is so much softer, his energy levels are amazing (he keeps up with my 3 year old son!). Wonderful brand, no by products. Worth every penny!
We have been going to Montana and Wyoming for about 14 years. We love it!!Such a beautiful part of the country and so much to do for a family.The kids loved riding around looking for buffalo and seeing the gysers and the paint-pots. Such a great family bonding time! Highly recommend a trip into Jackson Hole, WY to see the Tetons and then driving into Yellowstone and going to Big Sky, MT and through the park. Never a dull moment and different every time you visit. It's an ideal location no matter which season it is too!
sometimes in life we get so excited about what God is doing in and around us that we forget to slow down and remember why He's got us where we are currently. at least that's how it's been for me the past few days/weeks. i've got a lot going for me. i really do. i feel like God is taking me in some really cool directions.
While short haircuts will still be popular with some of the ladies, overall hair will return to something much more romantic. Look for a lot of longer tresses that are soft, wavy and ultra feminine. That extra hair length will be needed in order to pull off the biggest hair trend of the season - the ponytail. Think "I Dream of Jeannie" with high, higher, highest long ponytails that even have hair covering the elastic band. Some will be straight and ultra chic but a few will continue the soft wavy look or add a few gentle curls.
Sydney has been blabbing up a storm (A STORM) and her two first words are, I kid you not: "Mama" and "Blahblah-Blahblah". Just say it, that second one. If it sounds like a cartoon noise than you are spot on. Now these two seemingly unrelated utterances are the exact opposite of that: I truly beleive, in my CORE, that it is not a coincidence. To her, they are relational constants. Mama=blahblah-blahblah.
An "essential oil" is an aromatic oil extracted from a plant, the concentrated essence of that plant, and these oils (also known as volatile oils) are used in aromatherapy, as well as perfumes and food flavorings. In aromatherapy they are used in a number of different ways to have a healing effect on the body. As well as having a physical benefit, using an essential oil in massage is thought to improve a person’s physical, psychological and emotional well being in different ways, depending on the specific essential oil (or combination of oils) being used.
So I was in charge of preschool yesterday and I think it went well. My topic was fire safety. First I had a candle burning and I showed them (from a safe distance) what fire looks like. Then I blew it out and showed them what smoke looked and smelled like. Then I talked about how they should neve touch it because it is hot and can hurt/burn skin, clothing, hair, rugs, etc.
I have always wanted to see Stargate SG-1, but didn't want to get into it so late in the show.  I ended up finding all 10 seasons on DVD.  This is such a great value.  There are over 200 hours of SG-1 and plenty of great special features.  If you want to watch this series for the first time or want to own it for your collection this is the way to go.
I want to preface this post by saying that I love Ohio. I loving living here and being close to Michael's parents. I also love the friends we have made here and the experiences we're having here. That being said, I also miss my family. It's hard being so far away and not being part of those day to day experiences that I miss out on constantly. I miss being at those family events and am sad that every time I see my nieces and nephews they've grown significantly and don't know me as well as they know their other aunts and uncles. But the thing I miss the very most is having my mom and dad nearby. I miss seeing them and being with them and so much want my boys to have a close relationship with their grandpa and grandma. I am so grateful that my mom and dad try so hard to foster and build those relationships despite the miles that separate us.
This was a second cruise for my husband and I and a first with the kids.  Our first cruise was on a different line and it pales compared to the Disney cruise experience.  Our kids are 4 and 6 and they had a great time.  As soon as we got in the car to come home they asked, "When are we going again?"We fed the stingrays in Nassau and that was a perfect excursion for young kids.  My youngest was scared to be in the water with them, but she loved watching them from the shore.
I really hope that I start to feel better in month 4. Everyone keeps telling me I'll start feeling better soon. Please?! Let it be true! Right now I am so excited that I am going to have a child, but I've hated being pregnant. So I'm really hoping that the 2nd and 3rd trimester will be easier to love being pregnant. I am excited for my baby bump! I want it now :)I started my 'Belly Book' last week and I'm excited to see how this baby grows!
My schedule is a little bananas lately. I can't seem to find time to go out at night,keep my house tidy,see friends,do laundry,watch movies or do anything that feeds my soul.  I am also craving inspiration. A person,a song,a picture,a story...just anything. If my soul isn't inspired I feel dull and lifeless and I've realized it is essential for me to be constantly inspired. I thirst for it. Eleven o' clock at night is my new 6pm and I find myself not wanting to fall asleep at night simply because I enjoy my time relaxing at home too much. I need to begin to find a balance and force a change somehow. I adore my job and I feel like all the time and commuting I do is well worth it so I just need to find a balance. I'm craving a balance.
Well, today ended up being a greener day than I expected. I went off to work not feeling all that great, but had too much stuff to get done and figured that I could at least push through the first half of the day. That didn't happen. I spent most of the time I was at work hunched over my chair at my desk with a garbage can next to me in case my breakfast decided to rebel against me. I managed to get some stuff rescheduled and then high tailed it home hoping that I wouldn't have to pull over along the way.

By April 1st...I will be living in Houston, Tx. I never liked change but I am embracing it. I know God needed to get my attention. I was doing things my way, not reading my bible, not calling my mom, and just completely disconnected from God. Me and my life were simply a MESS!!! Within a month...I finalized my divorce, got fired from my job, found myself in-between apartments, AND gained 6 pounds!!!
You could have dated a man, supposedly hung like a horse, who traveled abroad and cheated on you - despite being given various outs - who proceeded to lie about it and didn't resist, until he discovered he had chlamydia - and even then lied, meanwhile, he lied about his only witness being in love with you to avoid contact.
The Beach Body P90X workout program is an intense, yet lasting way to get your body and life back in shape. I transformed the way my body looked, adding toned muscles and feeling full of energy with this program.
Undefining moments have defined the moment when I fell in love with you. An interest in everything but yourself is to be sought after by a fine messiah. Public agents are unworthy in the fact that they are not private.
Sound documents are useless to those who have failed their ears. I never think about you because I always see you.
I absolutely loved the disney cruise.  We went on a 4 day cruise on the wonder ship.  It was my first cruise and I don't think that I'll ever take another landlocked vacation.  Disney pulled out all the stops.  I loved everything from the food down to the little animal towel left on the bed.
my gosh! Lady Gaga's Bad Romance is echoing in my head! and, i think Fei have watched the video one hundred times already! LOL! yep! fei is a fan. we bought a headband with a big pink bow on it and she calls it her lady gaga headband :) aside from my last song syndrome there is another thing happening right now :) i'm releasing "Connection" a kit that i have collaborated with the brilliant Ange of Ange Designs! this kit really looks so sweet that i can almost eat it! it is jam packed with lovely papers and coordinating elements.
I had missed my flight, but when I got to the airport, the agent not only put me in the next flight, she even gave me a window seat!  The best part was her willingness to help.
I went to the Valvoline in Aurora. It was such an amazing experience. The manager, Jim, was very helpful and knowledgable. After going to Jiffy Lube I was scared of feeling pressured to buy more services but that wasn't the case AT ALL. He explained to me what was recommended for my car but didn't pressure me to do it at all. The prices were decent. The wait time was reasonable. I think I might come back to this store every time now.... even though I live all the way in Brookfield. I have never felt more at ease with a service station before.
I have been in my share of hospitals in the last 3 years (mostly having babies!), but none were quite like Highland Park Hospital. Okay, maybe shopping mall is a gross exaggeration, but there are definitely some similarities-- chatty nurses, valet parking, long waits, etc. Read on to find out more!
"The reality is there are no plans to do it because of the way that our games our serviced," Kim said in an interview with UGO. "The nature of our games are live, and in order to get them running right and to deliver that same experience, we're going to have to update monthly and adapt it on the fly. I don't think consoles are capable of that yet."
So with the holidays over, I can finally post about two things: My mom's shawl and J's afghan. Both were big hits with their intendeds, so I'm thrilled. He was speechless when he figured out what he had, but as we all know, that didn't last for long. He slept in it Christmas night, like a toddler.
I never watched The Wire when it was on TV, just didn't think I'd get into it~
My husband Netflixed the entire series last summer and we watched it together and all I can say is WOW ~ How did this series not win all of the Emmy awards each season?
We could hardly wait for each disc to arrive while we were watching it, not just for Season One either, for every single season~The drug trade and people on the streets were enacted so realistically that I actually felt like I was THERE with each episode~ I especially enjoyed the characters of Marlow, Stringer Bell, and all of the detectives and policemen.
last week i got a letter back from the wisconsin review. they turned down my 2 poems i sent them. that's fine. you can't win them all. the poems really go together and i think they deserve to get published, so i'll just send them to another place. if you can't take rejection don't go into the publishing buisness. publishing of any kind, music, book, movies, etc.
There are certain shades of lipstick that are chosen each season as the shade to wear. Unfortunately, not every shade of lipstick is suitable for every woman, particularly if they are overtly dark in color. It might be because of the woman's age, or it might have more to do with her skin tone. It could clash with the colors she has in her wardrobe. Whatever the reason might be, sometimes a popular dark lipstick color just can't be worn by everyone.
Look what I got for Mother's Day this year, what a clever little boy I have got! I haven't had much chance to look through it but it definitely looks like it has so great ideas for using the stash. I'll write a more in depth review when I have had a better look.
Simply put, Lavada is exactly what every women needs.  I read an article that said the makers of Lavada don't need to advertise and now I see why.  Once I took Lavada and felt the difference of being fresh, I couldn't help but share this secret with my friends.   Now they are the ones raving about Lavada. Plus they gave away a breast cancer awareness bracelet with my order to show support for the cause.  Very admirable!
I don't usually write reviews on products but I have to say that this is one product that actually works.  I've taken centrum and one a day vitamins without noticing any difference in how I felt.  Lavada is exactly how every article described it.  Small and potent with intimate health benefits where women need it most. I recommend Lavada to all of my girlfriends not only because its a great multivitamin, but because they support breast cancer awareness research.  It's nice to see a company that actually supports these causes.
These are great! My husband uses them and I never hear a bad word about them. He has been using these for over five years and is a faithful customer to this faithful brand. They are so nice and comfortable. He forgets they are in many times and we have to make sure he doesn't sleep with them in.
so my little guy turned 4 today! what an exciting day for him... i think i did a pretty good job faking not being sick most of the day. up early, took him to the store to pick out birthday cookies for school, picked him up from school, played on the trampoline, hung out inside with him... took him out for a birthday ice cream cone... all good times. unfortunately last night the flu hit me like crazy. i honestly can't remember the last time i felt as miserable. i couldn't even function. i layed in bed from 6:30 on... not even able to move... had a difficult enough time to get up and walk down the hall to the bathroom. anyway, woke up feeling a bit better, but not 100 % for sure. hope i'm better by tomorrow... for maz's family birthday partay! this partay is for him!!!
And it's a "traditional" sort of story telling that I have in mind here.  Not the kind played out in big city court rooms between corporate crooks and ravenous lawyers but the kind that brings to mind the dusty, dry heat of a Western high-noon.  A frontier town sheriff on the hunt for a thieving outlaw.  Or in the case of Timothy Olyphant's Raylen Givens, a U.S. Marshall on the trail of a Neo-Nazi with a rocket launcher.  After all, this isn't Deadwood we're talking about here.
Gladiator, along with Braveheart, Terminator, and Scarface, holds a high place in the "We're Manly Men" hall of fame. But it's not just gory battles and rippling muscles (although it has these things in spades). The plot is surprisingly emotional, telling the story of a family man trapped in a world where he excels, but wishes that he could just return home to his family. When his family is brutally murdered, he is forced into slavery as a gladiator, his only future the amusement of the blood-thirsty mobs of Rome.
My mother was a contrarian, she was. For instance, she always wore orange on St. Patrick's Day, something that I of course did not understand at the time, nor, come to think of it do I understand today. Protestants wear orange in Ireland, not here, but I'm pretty sure my mother had nothing against the Catholics, so why did she do it? Maybe it had to do with the myth about Patrick driving the snakes, a.k.a. pagans, out of Ireland. Or maybe it was something political. I have no idea and since my mother is long gone from this earth, I guess I'll never know.
LaLicious Sugar Soufflé body scrub has a devoted following and I now understand why.I received a sample of this body scrub in Tahitian Flower and after one shower with this tub of sugary goodness, I was hooked. The lush scent is deliciously intoxicating and it ended up inspiring compliments and extended sniffing from both loved ones and strangers alike.Furthermore, this scrub packs one heck of a punch when it comes to pampering dry skin. In fact, LaLicious promises that this body scrub is so rich that it will eliminate the need for applying your post-shower lotion. This claim is true — if you follow the directions.
See here's the thing: men have their neat little boxes through which they compartmentalize their lives.  Relationship over?  Oh, I'll just close that box.

It's not that easy for women.

Our relationships are not just a section of our lives-- they run through the entire fabric, a hot pink thread which adds to the mosaic composing who we are.  Take out a relationship and you grab that thread and pull.  Have you ever pulled a thread on a knit sweater?  That's what it's like.  The whole garment gets scrunched and disfigured just because that one piece was removed.  And then you have to pull it back apart, smooth it out, fill in the gaps.
Then there's my work life. I had an incredible review from my boss 2 weeks ago, and have been slowly adding more and more to my occupational plate as opportunities have been presenting themselves. I'm now going to be the head coach for 7th/8th grade girls' volleyball in the fall. I'm working at the Harlem School of the Arts this summer, just two mornings a week, but they've tentatively asked me if I'd be interested in working their Saturday program during the school year. I have three new piano students for the fall -- kids who are my students at school and will now also be my private piano students. I had my first lesson today with one of them, and it was incredible.
ve had problems in the past with contacts due to dryness and the hassle of always taking them out when I sleep.  With Acuvue Oasys soft contact lenses I've had more comfort then ever.  The dryness is gone.  I can wear them longer.  I can even sleep in them and not have to take them out every night.  I just put in drops when I wake up and I'm good for the day.  It's an ideal product for someone who is always on the go and has no energy to do anything but go to bed in the evening.  At an affordable price you can't beat them, especially when you use up a new box less often.
Ok, so how stinkin' cute IS this bunny?? I saw an adorable Easter sign at Hobby Lobby a few weeks ago and thought it would make a great card. I can't find the adapter that allows me to download photos from my camera phone, so I can't show you the inspiration piece. But it was an Easter bunny peeking over the top of an Easter egg.
We celebrated St. Patty's Day with Ethan, Carys, and Molly and.....a dinner made 'o green!  We had green pancakes with shamrock-shaped whip cream on top, green vanilla yogurt (green food coloring and I were special friends today) topped with green sprinkles, and honey dew.  For dessert, we had a magically delicious treat I referred to as Pots o' Gold - halved orange peels filled with "gold" (yellow jello squares) and garnished with gold coins (chocolate Easter candy)!  As for beverages, we had Sprite in clear cups with green Sprite ice cubes to color our drinks.  It really was so much fun to get into the spirit of St. Patty's Day.
I'm so excited about the gorgeous weather we've been having lately. I feel like spring has crept up early, quickly and unexpectedly this year. But maybe that's just because I was prepared for it to be especially late in coming up here in Sudbury. I'm not getting my hopes up though that it's here to stay, because we'll likely have some more winter before it's gone for good.
I own a 9 1/2 year old German Shepherd mix. We believe his father was a black lab with chow mix. His mother was a full-blooded German Shepherd.Fred is a great dog. He weighs 110 lbs. so you can't ever pick him up and his meds cost a fortune, but he's worth every time. I watch a lot of Court TV and I feel much more secure having Fred in the house with me!He's settled down a lot over the years. He used to be much more high strung and jumped on people, etc. Now he just barks a lot. He's definitely the alpha dog of our family.
Apparently if the rain we are getting this weekend were snow, it would be about  three feet deep. It is also pretty windy. Therefore the streets are awash with dead umbrellas rolling like tumbleweed across streets and frightening the dogs. The corpses are flung every which way including upside down. A few are neatly disposed of in garbage receptacles. Others look positively dangerous.
Joe's is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I love the fresh seafood, the staff and that my husband finds their steak to be one of the best in the city.  He doesn't like seafood so it great to have a place we can both go and indulge on the food we love.
I would like to say I was cool before my kids. I would like to say that my husband sucked all of my awesomeness out and this is what is left, a shell of a woman that talks about her kids to much. That back in the day I was a woman with a sense of style, that I looked great and rocked a room when I walked into it. However none of that is true. Truth be known, my kids and my husband are the best things that have ever happened to me.
To make the story short, I have been living on loans for the past 2.5 years while pursuing my midwifery education, scraping by. I had planned this trip at the end of my training, to cement all of my hours of studies and polish my skills before heading off into the land of the newly licensed and practicing home-birth midwife. Unfortunately due to the necessary end of my last relationship and the lies surrounding my gifted airline tickets for this trip never appearing, I had to reallocate the money I had set aside for lodging to purchase my ticket.
In the spirit of provident living we have several bags of hard red wheat stored away. Such a thing keeps for…probably forever, mostly because it is not easily used. So--just in case we ever had to survive on whole wheat I brought home a hand cranked flour mill. Our kitchen has one low counter for vertically challenged people—like me. The little mill attaches nicely there. It holds about three cups of grain.
Again, I am late with this one and I am really sorry. This past two weeks is literally BUSY with work, family and relatives. I have to come to office on the weekends and work untill 12am and then come back again at 7am then work till 12am again... then a few days after was Nico's baptism. I was late at preparation. Invitations was sent out 3 days before the event. AND relatives from Qatar visited us (which i have been waiting for because I miss my nephews and niece). It was fun, exciting, memorable and tiring. Its like everyday there is always happening and its so fast and I only get 5 hrs of sleep a day. So, to make this post short, I'll describe my life as crazy beautiful! hehe!!! oh, and you are waiting for the winner of the game? :)  :)  :)
Well I cleaned house, okay so all I did was the mirrors in the bedroom and dusted (with pledge (grins) then took a shower. I looked down and there was this huge clump of hair and I mean huge. I kinda expected this and even have made remarks about maybe it will grow back in curly instead of stick straight or black or red instead of mousy brown and I didn't think I would cry but I did.
I absolutely love it! It is waaaaaay better than the chi that I have been using for 3 years. I have damaged, frizzy, split-end galore, very thick hair. Also being that I live right by the beach my hair is always frizzing up. It usually takes me about an hour and so few minutes to straighten my hair with my chi. With the Solia (1-3/4") it took me 20 minutes. I was amazed with the very BIG time difference. This will very much benefit my husband as he is always hurrying me up when I'm doing my hair. It didn't snag my hair once & did NOT frizz up when I stepped outside. Now I feel i got ripped off when I bought the chi. This was very well worth every cent.
Many people fear the holidays because they are afraid of putting on a few extra pounds. Some even turn down party and dinner invitations in hopes of avoiding any new bulges or rolls. However, holidays are the perfect time to touch base with family members and friends that you don’t see regularly throughout the year, so it is important not to let fears of gaining weight prevent you from having some holiday fun.There are some minor adjustments that can be made to help ensure those extra pounds stay away. All it takes is knowledge, commitment, concentration, and a bit of willpower. Here are some suggestions that have worked for others and just might work for you as well!
I don't have a photo of Mom in her Shawl, but here are the finished pics, me modeling.

I did manage to knit almost all of my Christmas gifts - the only ones that I bought were for my sister and for friends. Yay me!
Hope the new year brings lots of goodness and joy and happiness for you and yours!
I like the Clear Care contact products. I used to use the kind my eye doctor gave me until my fiance recommended this one.  It can be a little pricey, but you can save some of the fluid by not rinsing the contacts before storing them in the case (which is always included in the new box of fluid).  I never rinse them, and my fiance always rinses his, and we don't seem to have any differences.
I find spring here, by turns, overwhelming, irritating, and unbelievably beautiful. Every year, including this year of course, spring blows me away. There are days when I dance in shamanic alignment with the colors and shapes, when I become more vivid, put on a deep shade of pink lipstick and extra mascara. Other days I just want to run away from it all, go north or head out west past the Rockies, to places less verdant and therefore more peaceful.

My respiratory system reacts as if it has been attacked which is the very reason I went forth this morning to buy bucketsfull of allergy meds. This year I'm trying Zyrtec, a more virile 24 hour concoction than the Claritin I usually take.

I'm diving into the big antihistamines this year because I have a feeling that after our cold, snowy winter, this spring is going to be extra powerful. Judging by the way everything seems to be blooming all at once, I'm thinking my prediction is spot on.
Living in the South brings blooms year-round. When Spring and Summer come, the pollen and blooms are multiplied. My allergies are usually sinus related, but this Spring I found myself going to the grocery store in search of eye drops to ease the pain of my sore, itchy dry eyes. I tried the cheap over the counter ones, but they did nothing to help. I tried another name brand eye drop, but it didn't help either. So I tried Visine A.C. Eye Drops.
I put off getting braces for my son long enough. He's 13, and it's just time, at least if I want to do it before it's time for dentures. I'm not even sure why I put it off for so long, but there just always seemed to be something else that needed to get done before we got around to it. Once he broke his ankle in football, and was laid up anyway, it seemed like the perfect time.
I didn't start watching AD until way after the show was over. Better late than never?! I don't know why or how I even began to watch this show, but I'm glad I did. After watching a few episodes online (probably Hulu), I immediately took myself to Target to purchase the seasons. I had always seen the DVDs at Target, just never really knew what it was about. Maybe that's why I started watching it, out of curiousity. This is hands down, one of my favorite shows.
Any excuse to go to visit the geniuses at the Apple store on 14th Street. The building is so stunning it's worth hanging about there getting giddy from all the glass stairs and so forth. And then to have someone do utterly clever things with the computer and unearth things I thought were irretreiviably lost.I think the place has had 196,000 plus photos taken of it already, but it's fun anyway.
Im proud to announce that same-sex marriages are now legal in DC! We are the 6th state to acknowledge same-sex marriges in the U.S. Late last year the bill was being proccessed and reviewed, and March 3 of this year the bill was passed! Its ashame that it took this long for recognition of happiness. The sex of a person should have never been relevant. Unfortunaltley it was, but no longer! Thanks to the persistence and hard work of the openly gay DC Councilman David Catania and Mayor Anthony Fenty, the gays in the nations capital are now able to live incandescently happy as they ought to!
Precious kept me on the edge of my seat. I liked this movie because I like the movies that make you become a part of them. This movie was very intense as it showed the true feelings of being molested while someone just stands by and then blames you for it. It also showed how to overcome that and move up and mature through it. I had strong feeling of anger towards this mother but had to realize that this mother had emotional problems too.
Another learning point has been do not take too much from home with you. For practical reasons I had to bring along school via online classes and my work to help finance this adventure but both have been rather greedy with my time. My aspiration to tap into a deep creative vein here for writing and painting has been blocked by my responsibilities. The creativity is there though. Most days I awake inspired, wanting to sit down to the keys or brush and express what I see and feel but often I sadly must put that impulse aside for work or school.
It seems that I may have neglected to inform you of the release of issue 7 of IGMS. I personally just barely realized it and am sorry for the delay of information. But it is...though without the Ender Saga story as of yet. I feel neglectful of this blog...but at least I am not with my new husband. So...I have my priorities straight. Oh and I think I might finally get him to read EG. Finally.

I only have a few weeks left in the school year and I am still eagerly awaiting the arrival of Keeper of Dreams. Yay! Then I might have something to write about...then you might have something worth reading. (besides my life.)

So anyway...I am happily married now and look forward to starting my life with my husband. Thanks everyone in my family and everyone that is there to support us--thanks for everything!! SMILE!!!
Today I took advantage of some free time and went shopping at Target and Walgreens. I was very happy with everything I purchased. One tip that I can give everyone is to know your prices. I keep a price book but over time I have gotten to know many prices so I know when I find a good deal. Like today, I found some toothpaste marked down for $3.49. I had coupon for $1.00 off that specific toothpaste.
I've been thinking about things. I've been thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my life, and I've decided that I want to take (at least) a picture a day so I can have photo albums filled with pictures by the time I'm (old enough to be?) a grandparent. And maybe then when I die (because I slightly obsess over death), people will be like, "Woah, look at her life." Or think I was a complete nut job (which I sort of am). And you know what? I'm totally cool with that.
I suffered from migraines and neck pain. i went to other MD's and chiro's but Doctor Alexis was the first who could really adjust me and provide therapy and other treatments that made a difference. I have gone 6 months with no migraines! This has been such a blessing-they helped me change my diet, get adjusted, and did AWESOME muscle work. I only had to go like 4 times before i was 100% now i see her probably once a month to prevent further migraines-and it has been successful!!!
I got into watching the Doctor Who showd a few years back and found myself glued to the screen because  the show is super & has peaked my desire for more.
I purchased this product a year ago before going on vacation to New York. At that time and currently I don't have a brush roll to protect my brushes. Not sure why I haven't bought one, but I will soon. Any ways I bought this because of many youtuber's doing reviews about it. To be completely honest I never thought that this product wouldn't work it looked like something that was worth buying.
I've started a monthly Crafty Night & yesterday evening was the kickoff. (I need to come up with a catchy name. "Crafty Night" is kinda b-l-a-h.) 6 ladies joined me to make some of those popular flat-backed marble magnets. SUPER easy to make! And super DUPER fun! It felt awesomely terrific to get all crafty.
he disney wonder was a great ship. The food was excellent. The shows were of Broadway caliber.There was plenty of activities to keep you busy including bingo. I won this trip which made it even better. We saw Nassau and Castaway Cay disneys island. I went on the glass bottom boat excursion. I lost my cap but it was retrieved for me.
If you are need of encouragement or wonder if God is able to move your mountain, please head over to the sidebar where Special Posts are listed. Start at Our Wild Adventure Part 1. You will be reminded of Almighty God's deep love for the orphan and how He will move mountains on their behalf....we call Him the Miracle-Working, Mountain-Moving, Awe-Inspiring, Gasp-Giving God!! Yippee Jesus!!
I'm the proud Mommy of Wesley(8/2005) and Ryan (7/2008). I am married to an amazing man. I'm a children's librarian and honestly believe I have the best job in the world. What can I say, I have been blessed!
