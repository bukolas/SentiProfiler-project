Jane went to see the psychiatrist today with a friend. She wrote out an agenda of questions for discussion but he was bemused by it. He thought he ought to have all the answers but didn't have an answer to one of them. He seemed not to understand that they were points for discussion rather than direct questions of him. He was frightened that he didn't have the answers. He was even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. Jane was yet even more frightened that he didn't understand the questions. He felt "got at" because of this ... but it was a genuine attempt to have a multi-disciplinary discussion. As the team leader, surely he should feel competent in this? Their ward rounds are described as multi-disciplinary team meetings. But he didn't feel confident. He could talk about medication, leave and risk assessments; anything else sent him into a panic or denial. Consultant psychiatrists in the NHS are not used to being questioned or having to substantiate what they are doing. They expect deference and in return do what the ward staff ask of them. It is four weeks since he suggested he wanted a second opinion for Sam. He has done nothing since then. When Jane discussed this with him he suggested a name for the second opinion. We have Googled him and he is an expert in "Schizophrenia", in medication and in treatment resistance. He has written papers about the additional medication that Sam's psychiatrist wants to introduce. What is the point in getting a true second opinion from someone whose background is such that they are almost certain to support what Sam's psychiatrist intended to do in the first place? We have been very polite with him so far. Perhaps it was good to have made him squirm a little today ... Though on previous occasions this has often had negative outcomes.
