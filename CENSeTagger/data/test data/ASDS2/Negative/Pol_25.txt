Data Protection Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Norman Lindop, Cmnd. 7341, showed broad acceptance of the need for some statutory control but less agreement about the machinery. One of the Government's objectives will be that our arrangements should keep costs down for the private sector and should contain those for the public sector within existing planned totals. We do not therefore propose to set up an independent data protection authority. Another objective will be that the arrangements should be sufficiently flexible to allow for differences between automatic processing methods, the purposes of data systems and the information they contain.
