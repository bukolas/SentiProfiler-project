Steffi, stef,stefu etc etc. whatever people like to call her they do.. and she is always there to listen to them. four years or if I cut short the exact duration, its roughly around 36 months since I know her.
At college, she is 5% at her desk, 80% chatting remaining 10% thinking about shijo.. :D but still she does everything in time.She is just like a kid.
I don't know why but all of us just love to get bugged by her daily and without her its so boring. So, always be with us Steffi.
Like friends forever!
She seems like a teddy and initially i always wanted maintain a distance from her till one day.............guess what we had a fight!!!!
this is one of the rare qualities she had got ......beside talking funny and being superficially intelligent.................but to be honest she can be really smart sometimes.............sometimes she is exceptionally intelligent(I wonder it most have come coz she is influnced by me :)).
