There should be caps put into place on the Doctors, Hospitals, and Pharmaceuticals for what they can charge. Maybe the government should put a stop to the AMA and the Pharmaceutical companies from using a lot of their money and influence for lobbying in D.C. in order to keep the prices practically out of reach for the average American. It is becoming increasingly ridiculous in this country that our government is practically allowing corporate America to intentionally get away with breaking the finances of the working class American.
