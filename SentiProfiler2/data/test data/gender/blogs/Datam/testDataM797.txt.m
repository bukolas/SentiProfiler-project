I have been using Windows machines for 20 years.  I worked at Microsoft in 1992 when they launched Windows 3.1.  So, as you can see, I don't come by my decision to switch to a Mac lightly.  So why did I do it?  First, I have had it with the system crashes that come out of now where.  And like many people, I am drawn to the clean design of the Apple computers.  And now of course that I have been using the iMac 24" for the past few months I now see what I was often told.  The software itself (Leopard) is more stable and faster than Windows.
