Well...it has been a crazy past few months- Christmas has been in full throttle for us!! We introduced our new 2009 Christmas silhouette...and were swamped with orders before posting it on-line! We wanted to share a few with you...these are still available... ...and hope your tree-trimming, wassail-sipping, carol-humming days are going fabulously well! Discuss on Ringsurf Ta Dah....here it is...with much fanfare and appreciation for the great carpenter and his masterpiece... ...the finished plate rack.... It was painted white and accessorized with black and white. Look at those trimmed out corners! One project down......1,444,000 more to go! Have a blessed and wonderful day! smiles, kari & kijsa Discuss on Ringsurf Praise God from whom all blessings flow... Discuss on Ringsurf Praise God from whom all blessings flow...

" She is your mirror, shining back at you with a world of possibilities. She is your witness, who sees you at your worst and best, and loves you anyway. She is your partner in crime, your midnight companion, someone who knows when you are smiling, even in the dark. She is your teacher, your defense attorney, your personal press agent, even your shrink.. ." ~Barbara Alpert Thank you Kari...for just being you! For more pink sweetness...visit the wonderful Beverly. ! Discuss on Ringsurf We just returned from a fabulous tip to Scotland...and at the risk of being the relative who makes you sit through hours of slides and photos...here we go!! Edinburgh was beautiful...an elegant European city with a wonderful laid back attitude... Edinburgh Castle was filled with beauty, history, and inspiration... The weather cooporated wonderfully- it only rained one day (yes, we know...it really was Scotland!) Every town, every tower, every castle and cottage left us loving this country...it felt like such a warm and welcoming place to visit... We even searched for Nessie, the Monster among the waters of Loch Ness... We checked to see if the Queen was visiting in residence at Holyrood...(on another note...must read Mary, Queen of Scots ...) Sterling, Pitlochary, Inverness, Ullapool, the Highlands... Everything was so lush and green...such a contrast of living beauty amongst the 500 year old ruins of St Andrews Cathedral... Views from the William Wallace tower overlooking the battle sites of 'Braveheart' Blair Castle &amp; Bruar Falls...they even had a seek and find game for the kids throughout this old castle!... This was Cawdor Castle...we had to hurry through...the Countess was returning in the morning! Beautiful, beautiful Scotland... The gardens were all still in full bloom... And we finished it off with a stroll along the Old Course...oooooooh...back to reality!
