Though the Oscar telecast left much to be desired, being slow-moving and chaotic, the red carpet was even more dazzling than usual. The trends were golds & metallics, blush pinks, electric blues, ruffles and pleats, and long trains. Here are the major stars, including which designer each was wearing. Below each image is a chance for you to glamorate. Click on any image to view the larger size.

Most of the Vogue Patterns, including the Vintage Vogue Patterns that have silhouettes from the 1930s to 1950s, are on sale for $5.75 until end of Friday at VoguePatterns.com . I bought 3 from the vintage (including the 1950s PinUp aprons) and 2 from the Misses, all for $30-something including shipping! &nbsp; $39 Halogen Pleat Shoulder Cardigan . Nordstrom. How cute are they?! I bought two: Hibiscus and Black (goodness knows, one can never have too many black cardigans). &nbsp; I hope everyone has a great day today, whether in a couple or single. It's really a day for telling everyone we love&#8212;family, friends, pets&#8212;that we care and are glad they are in our lives. So this is me, telling you :) xx GG Image from the cover of the March 1928 Film Fun magazine, by Enoch Bolles. From the Romeo & Juliet photoshoot by Annie Leibovitz for the December 2008 issue of Vogue. &nbsp; I woke up to hear the news: Lee McQueen has died at age 40. He was found dead in his London home, having committed suicide due to depression which set in after his mother's death last week. My thoughts go out to his friends and family. On the Alexander McQueen website is this statement: "On behalf of Lee McQueen's family, Alexander McQueen today announces the tragic news that Lee McQueen, the founder and designer of the Alexander McQueen brand, has been found dead at his home. At this stage it is inappropriate to comment on this tragic news beyond saying that we are devastated and are sharing a sense of shock and grief with Lee's family. Lee's family has asked for privacy in order to come to terms with this terrible news and we hope the media will respect this." While most of us fans and fashion lovers never knew him personally, we feel the loss keenly. McQueen was an exciting, inspiring designer and, through his clothes and runway shows, he made a connection with us. He will be missed for a long time to come. Wendy Brandes posted this video of a holographic Kate Moss floating in air like an angel, in an ethereal Alexander McQueen gown. I agree &#8212; one of the most beautiful things ever to grace a runway. There will be no more posts today, out of respect for a great designer, who left this world too soon.
