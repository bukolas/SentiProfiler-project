Due to high work load in my day job, just a quick update. My picture at istockphoto fell through - AGAIN! Can't deal with it right now though. Will do later. I now claimed a few blogs on technorati, as you know. Turns out, now I have one more thing to worry about. There's something called technorati authority. This is a measure of how important your blog is in the blogosphere of that topic. So now I have to build technorati authority.
