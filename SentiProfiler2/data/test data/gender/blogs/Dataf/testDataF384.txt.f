What I liked about CDO were the unique and interesting eateries in the city. Every time I go to this city, I would always eat in a fascinating restaurant. Another time, I had dinner in an Italian-inspired jaunt. One of my favorite coffee shop was Gazebo Café, because apart from the mouthwatering desserts and snacks, I also liked the ambiance and the home products they were selling at their cute tiny store, adjoining the café.
