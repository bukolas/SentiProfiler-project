When the Brisbane Roar had finished their practice session we decided to go over to see if we could meet some players. Geraldo was particularly interested in meeting some Brazilian players who were on the team. Most of the players had gone into the change room by the time we had walked over from the other side of the stadium but we were lucky enough to meet a couple of the Brazilian players who were talking to the coach. I told them that Geraldo was a top ranking soccer player in his hometown in Vanuatu and they were very friendly and were happy for us to take some snaps. The coach whose name was Kenny seemed very interested in Geraldo and he suggested I call his friend, David, a soccer coach at the Academy of Sport to see if he could include Geraldo in some training sessions before he went back to Vanuatu which was a week away. He said there was another Ni-Van boy who was in the training squad there. Wow we couldn't believe our luck! We managed to get another photo of Geraldo with a gorgeous Aussie player before we left. We drove over to Ballymore Stadium which wasn't too far and found out the Brisbane Roar did their soccer training at 9:30am in the morning so we all came back the next day to see them practice. Geraldo was very excited and watched them intensely. We decided that since Geraldo was such a keen soccer player that we should take him for a visit to the Suncorp Stadium where the big soccer games are played. The stadium itself was locked up but we could see into it from the stadium shop. Of course the stadiums in Vanuatu don't look like this! The fellas who were serving in the shop were very friendly and when we told them that Geraldo was a soccer player from Vanuatu they suggested we take him to another stadium called Ballymore where the Brisbane Roar, Brisbane's top soccer team, practised. On the way home on the CityCat Geraldo was in high spirits. He was really enjoying his stay with us in Brisbane! Our next excursion with Geraldo was to take him to the cinema. Geraldo had watched plenty of DVDs but had never been to a cinema before as there aren't any in Vanuatu. We chose to take him to a 3D screening of Avatar at South Bank which pretty much blew his mind. For the best view of Brisbane we drove Geraldo up to the Mt Cootha lookout. There are wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas. You can see as far as the Glass House Mountains to the North, the Gold Coast Hinterland to the South and Moreton and Stradbroke Islands to the East. As usual he was pretty knocked out! We actually managed to spot our house through binoculars. After our bike run we decided to take Geraldo to Kangaroo Point to check out the views. Kangaroo Point is situated on top of a cliff which is now the major rock climbing attraction for Brisbane's abseilers. Geraldo was pretty keen on the view. Geraldo was really overwhelmed by South Bank. He just kept saying "Oh Man!!" He just loved the man made swimming beach. The beach consists of a beautiful clear fresh water lagoon with views over the Brisbane River to the city. Surrounding landscape consists of white sandy beaches, bubbling creeks and shady tropical gardens. He couldn't believe the children's water playground either which I have to admit is pretty cool.
