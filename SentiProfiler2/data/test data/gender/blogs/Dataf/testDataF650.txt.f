The pots of giant amaryllis bulbs are lined up in a row in front of the eastern windows. All year long I wait, water and watch. It starts sometime in January when the first little green nub starts to push up through the dark soil. I wait more and check the other pots to see if there are any more tentative green shoots. Within the next month they all start to push upward in various stages. Usually the giant crimson flowers are first with the lightly blushing pink ones last. The display goes on in the eastern light for weeks filling my home with various shades of crimson, scarlet, white, and pink until finally the last bloom fades and they all rest once again.

I have always loved this book as well as the companion book, Through the Looking Glass , since I was a child. So naturally I had to see the recent Alice in Wonderland movie starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. I was charmed by Tim Burton's original approach to the characters of Wonderland. So in honor of March and the irrepressible hare, here are a few of my favorites from the handmade artisans of Etsy. Blackberry Blackberry is a sensitive, serious rabbit.

Dad was with us and at 70 was not up for climbing a mountain, but he was beaming from ear to ear to be in the mountains. We stopped often, looking at a small flower, commenting on the clear mountain water in the small stream that would turn into a mighty river. The clouds rolled in just as we reached a beaver pond. The mound of branches in the middle of the pond looked fresh and evidence surrounded us of this little animal's industriousness. Then it happened. Gentle drops began to fall. They left their beautiful mark on the still water and then disappeared. It was a moment I will always cherish. Summer Rain A summer walk along the Colorado River in Rocky Mountain National Park started out warm and sunny. A small isolated rain shower started at the same time we reached a beaver pond giving me this photographic opportunity. click here for purchase information on this photo Etsy Buy Handmade JulieMagersSoulen Spring is coming. Can you smell it in the air? I can. It puts a bounce in my step and anticipation in my heart. The spring wildflowers in the Rocky Mountains are spectacular when the winter snows are deep. This should be a very good year. One of my favorites, Indian Paintbrush or sometimes called Prairie Fire, grows at high elevations and low. Spring will come and new paintbrush will sprout. I can't wait!

The sun is hot, dry and masculine in nature; whereas the moon is associated with the feminine and dark energies. There are sun worshipers and folk that like to howl at the moon. We have early risers and night owls. Whichever group you prefer I hope that my photographs bring light to your day or your night. Tell me which of our celestial bodies brings out the best in you.

The gale is channeled up a steep narrow canyon and breaks over the ridge exactly where she stands. Her trunk is thick and twisted. Her branches are short and sturdy. She barely notices the brutal blast that pushes me about like the fragile being that I am. She offers sanctuary to every creature under her thick boughs where the air is quiet and the light dim. She stands protectively over all who accept her embrace. Thank you for your shelter, Grandmother Pine. Thank you for your patience regarding my computer difficulties. I am up and running smoothly again, although a bit behind. So my return is a little slow, but I will catch up and have many new photographs as the week progresses. Check back often.

I'm having computer difficulties. Please accept my apologies! I hope you enjoy this earlier published post on some of my water photography. SPLASH! (February 2009) I am an earth mama with a water spirit heart. Living in the Colorado Rocky Mountains gives me sustenance for my earth side. Their solid permanence gives me strength. But once in awhile my water spirit thirsts for salty oceans, serene lakes, and rivers wet and wild. I have not had my ocean fix recently but instead have found untamed waters and calm shores right here in Colorado. The first two photos were taken in Rocky Mountain National Park on a summer hike next to the St. Vrain River. It has been my favorite river in the park since I first discovered it in 1975. And as the surrounding terrain changes from fires and natural selection, the river still rages down the steep mountainside careening over the same rocks. I find timeless energy there. The last photo is of Horsetooth Reservoir just west of Fort Collins, Colorado. It is about four miles east of my mountain home and I can see it out my windows with the morning sun reflecting golden off its surface or a full moon making it a pool of pale light. High Country Cascades The day was warm and sunny on our hike along the St. Vrain River in Rocky Mountain NP. The water was cascading and spraying when I spotted a small plant, moss, and lichen clinging to a boulder. click here for purchase information on this photo Rushing Water Swirling and turbulent frigid mountain water careens by a large boulder in the St. Vrain River in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. click here for purchase information on this photo April Terns - ON SALE!
