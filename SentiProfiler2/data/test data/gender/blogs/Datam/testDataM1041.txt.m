I nearly lost last yesterdays post! Luckily the draft was complete. After seeing Laura had commented on Jasons post, I turned in for the night.I had a long sleep. I would like to have more time before class but i should be fine. I did lose the workI had started on my presentation, and I forgot about my chemistry quiz.

Mmm breakfast.. I just lost connectivity. Gessi posted two new models for me to see.
I got some balance transfer cheques!
I missed class and have decided to stay home to work on my presentation. Things that I would also like to do: work on my composition, work on my visual art, work on my guitar. I should reward my self with such behaviour. How much work is resonable to have accomplished before setting out to reward myself? I musn't over reward.

Finish a section, play a track draw a picture, get back to work?
