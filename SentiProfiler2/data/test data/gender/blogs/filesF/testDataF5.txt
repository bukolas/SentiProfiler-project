So remember, you might know what you like and indeed like what you know, but down that route ultimately lies boredom and repetition. Take the power to change unto yourself and make the first steps to trying a new place and enjoy the journey as well as the destination. Live for change and the excitement that novel things can bring. You’ll not regret it in the least!
In 1765 the curate of Sahuayo consisted of four villages; Sahuayo, San Pedro Caro, Santa Maria Asuncion de Xuquimatlan and San Miguel Guarachita, with Sahuayo being the main village. During the War for Independance (1810-1821) the Sahuayenses sent a large contingent of men who fought to defend the island and port of Mezcala (now Lazaro Cardenas) from Spanish warships. The Hacienda de Guaracho sided with the Spanish and was attacked several times by the insurgents.
Getting out of the capital of the Philippines, Manila, to nearby cities and towns is not an uncommon occurrence among the urban dwellers. With friends and relatives from abroad visiting every now and then, it gives us more reason to escape the metropolis. But with the “Viaje del Sol”, Spanish for “Way of the Sun”, we have all the more reason to embark on an adventure north of Manila.It was a road trip like no other. Armed with a Viaje del Sol map that would take us to the provinces of Laguna and Quezon, we studied and selected various tourist spots where we can stop over.
The choice of accommodation was made by our organization in the US, being one of the official hotels for the conference. With its quality standard and price, I was fortunate enough to be billeted in Hilton for free.
First of all we’re staying at the Bellagio, a cut above the regular accommodations in this city and reminiscent of Monte Carlo and other less seedy, more sophisticated examples of this genre. So the Vegas of the Bellagio has a touch of redemptive class. Not a little. Our room is impeccable, sprawling. Even the plumbing works in a luxurious way. But, as lovely as it is, it’s just a building.
Laurie Hirth, you have made such giant strides moving on in your life without Neil. Then, boom ... two steps forward, ten steps back. Sasha, Eileen, Patty -- you get it. Whether you're anticipating what's coming or are in the heightened sense of sadness. You get it.
March saw two scientific studies published regarding male sexual activity. Neither study made new discoveries but confirmed what historical documents and a casual observation of life already reveal.When Dr. Stacy Tessler Lindau and Dr. Natalia Gavrilova, of the University of Chicago, found that men outlive women sexually, their study created quite a stir across news, newspapers, and social media for three days. A Google search on “men outlive women sexually” lists references to the British Medical Journal in the top four pages of search returns.The study comes from survey data of 6,000 men and women between the ages of 25 to 86 years old. Researchers conclude after age 55 men average 15 more sexually active years while women of the same age average 10 years.
Finally, the sky was splashed with the red pallet of the setting sun. We were at sea before dawn until dusk. But it was worth a trip. It was a refreshing encounter with nature, from free-roaming animals at Calauit, to the coral gardens around the islands, to the fish species indigenous to the area.
Okay, why are people actually giving this girl advice on how to stop eating?? There's something wrong with that!! If you feel you are eating too much, cut down on your portions and it requires discipline to control it, but you can. To not eat is dangerous. Do you realize what that can do to you? Let me tell you. Eventually, your body will start eating away at itself. You will lose muscle mass and all body fat. You will start to look sick and emaciated. Then, people will start to ask you if you have a drug problem or eating disorder. You'll feel embarrassed. You won't find clothing anymore that fits well. But that's the least of your problems. You'll start feeling dizzy and light headed from not eating. You may pass out a couple of times. Then, you can go into organ failure, have a heart attack or get congestive heart failure. If you're lucky, however, you may be able to be admitted to a hospital where they'll have to tube feed you. Aside from this, I would cut down on portions and discipline yourself to not eat ONLY when you don't feel hungry. Cut down on portions, eat a healthy diet and don't indulge in sweets all the time. Give them to yourself occasionally as a treat. It takes work, but you'll be fine.
So, here it is, just about 3 months since our last blog post. I'm sure we've lost all of our readership at this point, but something just happened that compels me to write. Eventually someone out there in the universe will stumble upon this post but until then, I'll just savor this post for myself.
In addition to orienting myself once I arrive into any city, I usually take a walk at night. Be it in search of food, or just to feel out the city by night – how women flow and if their dispositions suggest otherwise when they walk around. How many stares are received and if there are sinister undertones to them. If locals don’t think twice before veering into near pitch-black alleys and down dark tunnels…Sorted through 350+ photos on a train to Vienna with most of them taken around dusk or at night – my main photography task for Budapest.
Several foreigners were also staying at the island to dive at nearby reefs and diving spots. But for us, we were contented with just snorkeling at the periphery of Bonito. We couldn’t go too far because the current were strong and large passenger vessels plying the Batangas-Mindoro route pass by the island.
If you’ve previously been on regular trips to places and have recently found that those places are losing their charm or losing whatever it was that made them “unique” for you, then perhaps it is high-time for you to considering taking time out to visit somewhere new? Set a course for a place – either near or far – that you’ve always wanted to visit, but have never found the reason. You’ve found your reason now, so throw caution to the wind and just DO it! After all, you only live once, so you should probably try everything at least once as well.
It's the simplest things that remind me every day just how much I miss Leroy. The chatter in our house over the Inaugural events of the past few days would have been non-stop. Recapping the coverage, sharing experiences. It's just what we did as journalists, as interested observers of history.
Back at security with that Deja Vu feeling. This time I make it all the way to the x-ray machines. "Excuse me ma'am, is this your bag?" (Why do they call you ma'am? It makes you feel so old.) What could they possibly be questioning in my little tote? It's only a book, newspaper and a bottle of water for my wait. "Ma'am, you can't take this bottle of water, do you want me to throw it out?" I notice he's not giving me a whole lot of other options so I say "Yes" since it's clearly the price I have to pay to get to the other side.
The knife looks exactly the same as when I handed it off to Sharon at the Rapa Nui airport 7 months ago; but it's not the same. It's no longer just a Swiss army knife, but instead is an embodiment of worldwide humanity. Sharon was a wonderful host when we stayed at Te'Ora, her guesthouse on Rapa Nui; but her obligation ended there. She didn't have to take on the mission of returning my knife to me, but she did. And while it took several attempts to keep her promise, keep it she did. Thank you Sharon for being the wonderfully kind person you are. And Corie who never knew me and most likely never will, she took on that mission as well.
My dear friend Carol, who walks with me, made an interesting comment as we were finishing our six mile jaunt. She said before she got into walking in the winter with me, she only thought of it as something she had to get through to reach Spring.
We started early in the morning as we rode for about three hours towards Batangas, a province south of Manila, the capital. We reached a small port and boarded a boat that carried fourteen of us. It was about 45 minutes at sea until we reached our destination, Bonito Island. I’ve heard of the island but I’ve never been there. Finally, I would attach an image to the name some friends have been mentioning about.
I’ll admit. Whenever a foreigner spews a few words of Yòrubá to me, regardless of delivery quality, I instantly warm up, throwing them a cheesy grin of approval. This gesture shows they’ve made an effort to learn my tribal tongue, one of 521 estimated Nigerian languages they could have chosen from. If they open up with Pidgin English instead, I instantly perk up. Speaking Pidgin transforms them from visiting foreigner into one of hundreds of well integrated expatriates in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. There’s a certain intimacy that this form of broken English emits; a down-to-earth, survivalist approach to everyday living and hustling in Africa’s most populous nation
With the soothing sound of a fountain behind me and the river beyond the restaurant, my friends and I feasted on the prepared menu. There were little walls, a feel that made the restaurant partially merged outdoors. The rooms at the loft were cordoned off but could be viewed by visitors.
But our first priority was to enjoy a Sunday buffet lunch at Kusina Salud. I have heard of it from a friend, and was told that it was partly owned by renowned designer, Patis Tesoro. It was becoming more popular by the minute, so it was always better to make reservations ahead of time.
I am 13 and my boyfriend is 15, we have been dating a few weeks and I've only seen him twice because he lives an hour away. I have had boyfriends before, and only kissed and made out with one and we dated for nine months. I haven't kissed my current boyfriend yet, so after I gave him a hug when I was leaving I went to give him a kiss, like a little peck but then he was going for more so I kinda backed away because I don't want to make out yet. So what do I say or do with out him getting mad or things being awkward? Please help!
My first nights in the US, specifically in San Francisco, were spent in a cozy bed in Hilton San Francisco Union Square. I arrived late at night, after a grueling trip across the Pacific Ocean. Traveling alone to attend the National Conference on Volunteering and Service, I bravely proceeded from the airport to the hotel through the metro train.
Then there’s the guy, he has to be a guy, he’s not a man, not a boy. He’s trudging round the endless marble malls in his sneakers with a backpack on his back and a computer bag slung over his shoulder.
In the afternoon, after our Apo Island escapade, I lounged into a beach chair underneath a coconut tree, overlooking the beach and the island. The cool breeze and the quiet ambiance at Malatapay were relaxing to the mind.  But my interlude was cut short as we had to pack our things and head back to Dumaguete. Although we wanted to stay a bit longer, we had to bid Malatapay Beach Resort adieu. Till our next visit.
Pick up any newspaper and you will see all the evil that our lives are currently filled with. But I know, after having traveled the world for a year, that this world is filled with incredible kindness. I know this because we were the recipient of it many times over.
Last year, I’d also received a one-liner from the same editor asking if I could review a tour for him. Since I wasn’t on location at the time, I recommended another writer who happened to be on location. The fellow writer took the tour and wrote up the much needed dispatch. For those who think travel writing needs to be a fiercely competitive cutthroat world of hoarding contacts, kindly read Julie’s fantastic post on Writers’ Karma. Time permitting and within reason of course, taking on last minute assignments is a great way of building continued trust and reliability between you and your editor. Meeting deadlines is extremely important as well. Always go with your intuition and negotiate an extra day or two upfront before you start writing, instead of later.
You may be thinking "Oh I would never do that", unfortunately you probably do to some extent. If you've ever bought a woman a drink, flowers, chocolates, taken her out to a lavish dinner in order to get her to like you (as in you weren't in a relationship yet and she's not in love with you, your doing these things to get her to like you more). Then you're putting her on a pedestal. Yes you can do these things for her once you're in a relationship and she's already in love with you, but never do them when you're still dating and you're trying to get her attracted to you. This just screams out "Hey I don't deserve a woman of your beauty, but I'm willing to bribe you with expensive things to make up for that"
Nothing prepared me for the surprise I’d find in my first-time at Black Island. Part of our Calauit tour in Palawan was some stopovers at islands around Busuanga. A short distance away from Calauit was Black Island, where the Slovenian franchise of Survivor, Survivor Srbija: Philippines, shot some of their episodes.  Black Island loomed from afar like a black rock. But as we approached, the dark color became green and the white sand beach emerged. The sea became aqua blue and turquoise green that was in every way inviting us to dive in and enjoy a refreshing dip under the warm sun.
And when “warmer” sets in and the temperature rises, talk of beach outings gets a notch higher than the usual. Stating a destination is now an urgent matter. Yahoogroups are filled with discussions of possible summer adventures for the year. Even in our office, where there are just six of us, we contemplate of a possible outing, although it won’t be official business and we would be spending out of our own pockets.
Michael noted earlier that the money is flowing for pro and anti-reform TV ads this week. One more was just released - this time from Moveon.org. The ad flashes pictures of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. while a voiceover says voting for health care reform amounts to being "on the right side of history." Moveon.org, a left-leaning group powerful for its ability to raise a lot of money quickly, is pulling out all the messaging stops. Greg Sargent also suggests the ad is a signal to House Democrats that, come fall, Moveon.org will be there for those who vote for health care reform now.
We went back to Bonito to wrap up our weekend outing. Finally, beach fun was over and we were en route to the big city.  Three years ago seemed only yesterday. As I snap back from my reverie, I smile, looking forward to a beach outing this year. That’s the beauty of living in a tropical country with 7,107 islands. We have a list of options where to spend our summer.
While waiting, we stepped out of the restaurant to look around the neighborhood. The restaurant was strategically located at the corner of Mason, Turk, and Market St. A neon light sign “Soul Food” was adorning the window. President Obama’s face was displayed at the entrance. Everything was quiet outside, where everyone seemed oblivious of the cheery atmosphere inside Farmerbrown.
As I got to the airport, I tried to exude confidence as I haggled with the taxi driver, to avoid being scammed. Finally, he gave in and he took me to my hotel. Little did I know that the airport was too far from the city center. In fact, it was situated at the elevated area way off the city proper. I think I bargained a lot for that long taxi ride.
Women don't want a man that constantly says "you decide", "I don't know" and "whatever, you choose", they reek of being a little boy who can't make up his mind rather than a real man and giving her a response like this will really turn her off. If she asks something such as "where shall we go for dinner", simply pick an option that you would like to do. If she opposes and wants to go somewhere else she will tell you. She asked you the question so it's up to you to make the decision, telling her "you choose" will only frustrate her greatly.
First off-if you and your fellow politicians really want to address this problem head on, cut your own taxpayer funded health benefits to that of the typical middle class families. That will be the light the fire under your behinds, so to speak. You should also propose that Congress and the House have a mandatory 5 day workweek as well-because how do you enact change if you are not there to come up with solutions?
When afternoon came, the tide slowly shifted and the rocks at the other side of the island emerged. We walked through the shore encircling tiny Bonito as we explored the upper part of the heart. Little crabs, marshy land, interesting stones and shells, and intriguing species greeted us along the way. An hour later, we have rounded Bonito island. We dipped at the pool while the beautiful sun finally made its bow at the horizon.
There is so much in health care that can be changed to improve care, but society's view of what is expected from a doctor, a nurse, a hospital, or rehab facility needs to be adjusted. Research is showing that people recouperate better in their own environment. Also, research shows, that longer hospital stays increase the chance of acquiring a hospital based infection. People need to know that staying in the hospital is not the best thing if they are medically stable and can be transferred to home or a rehab facility.
It's been a weekend of bright blue beautiful days. Very cold but spectacular days. Walking on the C & O canal, I look up into a sky that is so clear. No clouds. Just the bare branches of the trees in their deep winter sleep, reaching up to the heavens.
The new site, the Our Cancer place, will allow us to continue and even grow with pictures and stories and conversations. So many of you have already found it and have begun to carve out a new place. Spread the word. There's room for so many more who need a place like this to feel welcome. When you're in cancer world, feeling welcome and safe is a gift.
Yes, as unfair as it may seem, men do tend to lose weight faster than women. This can be upsetting, particularly when a man runs around the block a few times and seems to instantly lose 10 pounds while a woman's weight loss moves about as fast as a snail. But, there are physiological reasons for that difference: -Men have more muscle. This allows them to burn more calories, even when at rest.
If there's anything you take away from this article, make it this. Women want a guy who can make them laugh, if you can do that for them you're 75% of the way there. If you can make them laugh you can screw up with every other area and still get her attracted, and if you can make her laugh as well as remember these other 4 areas, you're set to attract any woman you desire.
Climbing up to Fisherman’s Bastion in the Buda district and waiting till dusk to watch those final rays of sun cast their warm glow across the Danube, over the Parliament building, and across a dozen or more centuries-old churches scattered around the Pest side is a scene hundreds of photographers have probably captured yet it remains breathtaking, no less.There are a few cities that truly photograph beautifully at night, and Budapest certainly is one of them. While summer months bring in droves of tourists, traveling in early March for us meant fewer crowds and strong wispy winter chills filling the air. This also meant more locals going about their daily business, and a smaller chance of getting mugged or harassed.
We chuckled with him when he talked about losing his hair and we told him there was no shame in admitting he was just plain scared. He came for advice and he got that, too. His journey was a short one, but he made an impression. He left his mark, and that's what it's all about.
Our cottages were right behind the dining hall and were overlooking the sea. Rooms were neatly done with air conditioning units and private showers.
My thoughts often go to the obscure. Not the "big picture" of what we were doing or what we were seeing but some oddity that stands out in my mind. A year ago today we were standing in front of the Taj Mahal. You can read about that on Marty's blog from a year ago. I'm remembering Agra; home to the Taj.
So there we were: my Chinese roommate and I, a Filipina, with two Singaporeans, two Koreans, and our four American hosts who braved the late afternoon San Francisco chill walking towards this restaurant that they were raving about. We were told we would be eating southern food. What that was, I still had to see and taste. The place was called Farmerbrown, known for its soul food, its farm-fresh soul food.
As I came upon the hotel lobby an hour close to midnight, the receptionist immediately attended to me. It was fast, something I thanked the angels.
Concerned that small packages have a way of disappearing and never arriving to their final destination, Sharon later told me, via email, that she would hold the knife until she herself would be traveling to the US in the summer. Once in the US, she would mail the knife to me. Sharon arrived to the US but I got no package, only an email saying that she had essentially done the same thing - left the knife in her carry on instead of packing it in her checked bags. She passed the knife onto her assistant who was still at the airport as a sense of deja vu permeated the air.
Then, in March of 2009, at the tiny airport on Rapi Nui, I saw the bin of items confiscated by airport security: lighters, scissors, knives. Knives! Oh my God! I'd forgotten to take my knife out of my daypack and put it in my toiletry bag. With my luggage already checked, there weren't too many options left. It was either surrender my beloved knife to airport security and never see it again, or run after our guesthouse host, Sharon, who was still at the airport awaiting her most recent guests on the arriving flight. For me it was a no brainer. I gave my knife to Sharon asking her if she would mail the knife back to me in the US in 3 months time when I would be returning home. She said she would do her best and then I had to let go of the outcome.
After our sumptuous meal, we proceeded to our respective huts on stilts and fell into sound sleep. The morning chill and the light peaking through the bamboo slits of our window woke us up. Dawn has come but it seemed the sun was nowhere in sight. We dressed up and went out of our cottages to be greeted by the breathtaking view of the water. So, this is Malatapay Beach.
Nothing is FREE. Health Care has a cost. Other countries DO NOT HAVE FREE health care. They have HIGH taxes that pay for the cost. So why increase our taxes to get minimal and lower quality health care. The paper work , payroll, cost of service, RX etc need to be looked at and regulated. If we had a better tax code --- ie. no income tax- we would have more money in our pockets to decide what level of health care to purchase. The system could be better, yes but should not be handle by the government. My concern is why does it have to be tied to our jobs?
Well i don't know what you can say, but eating slowly helps your digestive system work well and digest better and just eat the serving size of what you eat and if after 10-15 minutes you are still hungry then go get more. and as well if you are still growing and in puberty and/or having your period then that can affect it and you could be hungrier and if you don't gain much weight then right now you are prolly just gaining it and it WILL slow down. and if you have a sweet tooth then everybody does, that just means you have to have sweets in moderation.
Our coral watching continued as we proceeded to the Coral Garden. It was a sloping reef that also had several coral varieties. It was truly like a garden beneath the sea. Spiky corals, fluffy ones, round ones—you name it and you’ll find them dancing with the waves underwater.
It's come to my attention that there seems to be 5 different things that men never seem to *get* about women, unfortunately every single one of these mistakes is holding men back and I'm quite sure there is at least one or two of them stopping you from having incredible success attracting women.
Women are predisposed to store and retain fat. Women have higher levels of estrogen, a hormone that works works to keep the fat on a woman's body so it's easier for her to get pregnant. That means women have to work harder to lose weight at the same rate as men. Men's bodies respond more quickly to exercise. Women's bodies, meanwhile, actually go into a sort of starvation mode, slowing the metabolism to hang onto more fat.

I wish to bring your attention towards the BIMAL Auto Agency’s service that MARUTI in Bangalore has authorized to. I write this to you because MARUTI is known to be extremely customer-friendly and good service providers. However, my experience with BIMAL Auto Agency, Indiranagar leads me to doubt this.

I know Nivi as a little sister, young play mate and now, good friend.. We are cousins with whom I can have a serious discussion as well as girly talks.. I love her.. Since she has become a night owl lately, I am getting to talk to her all through my day and nights.. From when I have seen her, she has not changed much - I was not allowed to pick her up when she was young (even I was too young then..) and now, cannot do it for you all know the obvious reasons ;)
It was a quiet afternoon in the Azalea kingdom...the kind of quiet that lends itself to mind-numbing chores and pointless conversations; It is also the kind of quiet that makes one restless - a strong yearning to launch oneself off this state of inertia. And if you entered the Royal nursery that's what you would find Princess Mei doing...trying to jump off The King's arms and fly into the skies on a new adventure.
How can I ever not accept a testimony from the sweetest and the cutest sis of mine!! Who by the way will be mad as ever for not getting the one thing that she has ever asked me to do!!!! Shew will do it soon di !! Just for U!!

Disk partitioning divides the data storage space of a hard disk into separate areas referred to as 'partitions'. Partitions are usually created when the hard disk is first being prepared for usage. Once a disk is divided into partitions, directories and files may be stored on them. Because of later changes on the computer and operating system, often an administrator or power user will be faced with the need to resize partitions, create new partitions in the unallocated space, and sometimes even undelete partitions that were previously removed or deleted.
I promised a testimonial . So here I go! ( Point to be noted - I received a couple of threats that drove me to make this promise . And I also promised to keep the insulting to a minimum but gosh it's too tempting )

Well , Adithya was my classmate for one whole year (I think) . It's sort of difficult to tell 'cause he hardly ever came to college!

Jokes apart , He's a cool guy to hang out with and a stylish dancer!
Total fun to be with and takes things lightly.

Remember that one time we pranked you when you bunked a test ?
That was fun! =)

Anyway , It was really nice knowing you and have fun at your new college! =)
Good luck and Stay in touch!

Cheers,
Bhargavi
How on earth did the present model of life evolve? It appears flawed in not inconsiderable ways. This post will touch upon one of the more popular models; the one based on employment. Employment, job, work, career-call it what you will-is at the core of this model. By that I mean more than 50% of waking hours of those living this model is consumed by the employment factor. 

Employment typically takes place in organizations. The goal of an organization is to maximize shareholder wealth. I am not going to examine that goal. Looking at things from an employee perspective, I find that organizations function on mind bogglingly flawed principles.

It's been five years since I began blogging. It is interesting to note that this blog got out the storyteller in me! Much of my initial blog posts were more personal or non-fiction rather than stories and somewhere in the middle, my storytelling instincts woke up and the result, I ended up even changing the name of my blog to "The storyteller's hut".
hmmm sriram...he s one sweet gud guy...kinda those few transparent n straightfrwd guys lik whom to find s difficult in orkut...we ve been chattng fr few months nw n found him to be pretty cool...does lotsa coll wrk in d weekdays n lotsa chattng in d weekend...gud balance dude...lol...jus kiddng ;0

I have a special place for Tibet in my heart — especially since one of my dearest friends is a Tibetan. And I think that it’s quite a strug gle for Tibetans today try ing to find their iden tity wher ever they are in the world. It’s not easy when your home land is no longer yours. Or that you can no longer even “visit”. And that the only images you can see of your home land are the ones you see through films that make their way out of the bor ders. I can’t even begin to think what it feels like for the Tibetan community.

Love this girl shez sooo badass. Ross (not the guy in friend's but the store) is our special place...we like to dress for less...hahahahahaha. This testimonial is as loosu as we are. I'd like to close with a song: 
The party needs to get its act together everywhere. They have not been effective in Parl. No use harping on MS. His days are over. Rahul will be the PERSON to oppose. Who is being groomed for this. The party should have young faces from dalits, obcs, muslims and christians also. They should be visible.In fact constituency wise tickets should be issued right now. And also they should have a shadow cabinet, with appropriate ministers in waiting, talking on key issues in Parliament pertaining to their ministry. No Arun Shourie - BAD. No Yashwant Sinha - GOOD and Jaswanth is out.The party should also explain the structure - President... VP etc, the precedence and stru. A good corporate culture will see them win next elections. Already the wave is building against UPA.
Yet another very important episode of my life began.

January 25th, when i got the big doubt, i could not wait a minute.
Kumar suggest we wait for a week and then see a doctor, he was afraid i might get dissapointed.

Thats me, very impatient. Finally took home test and it came positive. Informed my mom and mom-in-law. mom was confused that how i can test at home. mom-in-law was skeptical as in her opinion it is too early to know about it. Next day i got the same test done from a clinic and it came positive.

One time-tested tradition that hasn't changed in Chennai is that  when you go to someone's house, you always walk away with a blouse bit. About 15-20 years ago, this was actually a good thing. I've seen my mom stitch blouses from all the various pieces she got from neighbors, relatives and friends. Sarees were simple back then, didn't have "attached" blouse material, colors were straight forward and blouse pieces were always of the 2x2 variety. Everyone was happy.

Mr.Sunil Kumar promised us that he will deliver new brand Maruti Alto LXI to our residence (i.e., home delivery) with his driver Mr.Manjunath on 17-June-2007. We were asked to be present for the pooja of the vehicle at BIMAL Showroom, Indiranagar and assured us that the vehicle will be safely delivered to our residence through BIMAL driver Mr.Manjunath.

While parking the vehicle for fixing the Basic accessories, Mr.Manjunath, driver of BIMAL Auto Agency dashed another vehicle (which was just parked aside BIMAL showroom) and met with an accident, in which the vehicle which was supposed to be delivered to us got damaged.
