I haven't decided quite what I'm going to do with them yet. I might try a short game using Rattrap's Broadsword Adventures, or else I might try running a solo RPG scenario using one of the old school D&D clones, probably Labyrinth Lord, along with the Mythic GM Emulator, which I just recently picked up and which looks fairly interesting. Either way I'll most likely post the results here.
