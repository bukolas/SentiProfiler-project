It saddens me greatly that you can not understand the cause of the white racialists of this world. It is people like yourself who turn a blind eye to the truth that are becoming the downfall of this society. Sitting back in the comfort of your home not even lifting a brow to the atrocities we as whites face every day. What once was truly gods green earth has turned into a melting pot of mixed breed degenerates who fester with disease, bringing crime and drugs into the backyards of my white children. Have you no pride in your roots, have you no self respect and respect for your forefathers who painted these lands with their own blood to ensure that the people who built these countries may dwell in them with dignity. You mock the white racialist movement, perhaps because you are blind to the strength it generates between those involved. When persons spanning from all across the world can gather, with no prior meeting of one another and feel as though they are brothers and sisters, of the same flesh and blood, there is a unity and bond there that can never be broken. There is no greater cause then that of one to salvage the most spectacular race that ever graced this planet, there is no greater pride than that of ones own heritage, there is no deeper love and devotion than that of my brothers and
sisters who have opened their eyes and seen the truth. It is a bond far beyond your comprehension. I leave you with a fresh quote to add to your archives, one
that has my personal dedication to not only those on the frontlines of this struggle, but those who remain nameless, those who every day devote their lives
to the most precious war in existence.

Nothing is impossible. Where there is a will, there is a way. Everything falls before the man of indomitable will. Suffering and sacrifice are necessary; we are hardening ourselves for the most decisive struggle in all of human history. Victory will fall only to the most truthful, the most fanatical, the strongest, the bravest, and the best. Be that."
