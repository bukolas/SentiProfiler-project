Interest in Norton's take on things, and any reference to him returning becomes a major conversation, and I hope Marvel pays attention to all of that energy being spent.  I think it's really Marvel's decision at this point, not Norton's, and Marvel will make it a priority if they are told, loud and clear, "This is a priority."  They could easily write around Norton or replace him, but I think that would be a creative misstep.  When you have a collaborator who is this smart, and this willing, you shouldn't walk away.  You should embrace them, even if that means doing some difficult things and making some choices that cede some power.  Marvel is being incredibly smart about the films they control these days, and they have a chance to line up a truly great cast when the Avengers assemble.
