No, I didn't put those in the wrong order. As many people know, I have collected every incarnation of Star Trek ever seen on the screen, both large and small. However, there are definitely some I have not had the time to see. I decided to correct that, and start watching them all. I watched the first episode of Enterprise tonight. Unlike my recent attempt to go back through the original series, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, this was the pilot, so not everything worked smoothly. The actors need to learn their characters a little, and definitely need to work on their chemistry. But I found the plot engaging, and the effects decent. I enjoyed watching some more flawed characterization. It is logical that humanity had a ways to go from where we are now to where we are by next generation days, but I had not seen it on film before.
