have you ever wondered why/some people get high/look up into the sky/pondering the exact day and moment at which they will die/well give it a try/you might break down and cry/realize you’re living a lie/realizing life does suck/and how many people out there don’t give a fuck/well some of us run out of luck/lay in on your death bed feel in stuck/lookin into the light/hooked up on life support/tryin to make it through the night/the rich people they got it made/movie stars gettin laid/while some are on the streets just tryin to get paid/well that’s all I got to say/that’s it for today/take it as it is or just walk away
