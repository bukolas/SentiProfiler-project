This morning I gave someone a gift which spread a smile across their face. That was the best feeling ever, to know that making a small amount of effort would improve their day dramatically! 

I am of course talking about Mother's Day. Today I gave my Mum a 2ft card and a small teddy bear (which she's now called Aristotle..!), and the smile that came on her face was brilliant :) I'm really glad she likes it, and today things seem to be a lot more on the up for her, which is a relief considering last week. 

As for myself, well today is another day of normality. I'm dying for a week Saturday to come, when unbelievably huge deadlines are out of the way. Every night of this week is going to be dedicated to making some form of draft of my dissertation. I know fully well it won't be anywhere near the standard my final draft will be, but heck, why not make the effort and get some useful feedback. I got a 2.2 for the dissertation report that I did, which was 20% of my overall dissertation grade. Granted, it was a low 2.2, but heck, it could've been a 3rd! So that's given me a bit of a boost. I know fully well my stress levels will go through the roof this week because of my work, but i'll manage hopefully :) And the weekend will bring some much needed relaxation and giggles!
