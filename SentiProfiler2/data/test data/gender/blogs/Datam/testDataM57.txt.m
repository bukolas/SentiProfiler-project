Its me!!!! - Hi everyone, welcome to my Scrible Pad!!!

Hope you had a great day!!!

Well 'Scrible Pad' is a blog which talks about random topics ranging from what i did today to some of the most interesting materials i found and it can range from an interesting article to a piece of information which might(or might not)be of use to us. Or something fun.....
Its basically my Scribling pad...Will upload a lot of pictures from my own design galery and other sources as well. BTW did i tell ya that i am a designer? so now you know how much i love fashion, graphics, prints, colors, bags and shoes and I LUV 'DOLCE & GABANA' and few more..blah blah blah, the list goes on. 

Well there you go, so Dig in guys and find youself nowhere but right here with me in my world of chaos, beauty, glamour, boredom, expectations, ambitions, bitching sessions, shoes, Bags, citys and much more...so to say 'Expect the Unexpected'...

Yippeee!!! Have fun guys :)!!!
