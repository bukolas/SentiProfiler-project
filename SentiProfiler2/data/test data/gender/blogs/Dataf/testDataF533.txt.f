Arabic Love
You turn.
There is such grace and beauty in that torqued motion,
in the way you look at us all.
I am going to dim my light.
So I can dissolve in yours.
I look at the vast stretch of barren fields that separate us.
I see many others have dimmed theirs too.
Is there a way to measure love?
Because you have conquered us all.

Zoom-in: 
A woman, turned away, and dressed in white.A bright shade of yellow light fills the gaps, silhouetting her.

Zoom-out: 
The landscape melts into the frame. The woman is standing near a tree, and she is in the middle of an olympian field. 

Lights, camera, action!

A man comes running from behind, the penumbra of yellow light being gradually covered by the the man's presence.

Shift camera angle to man's view point:
He gazes at her, as if he wants this image to stay in his mind forever. She turns, and this movement of hers could kill him! This is abstractly portrayed by his decision to "dim his light", or his 'aura' (and therefore, arguably, his ego).
