Our special children, these bright and creative ADHD children, can be such a challenge to parent. We watch them bounce around in our neuro-typical world, stumbling and falling more than their peers. We want to fix it and make it all better, as though ADHD is just a boo-boo, but it's not and we can't. At some point, we come to accept that it can't be changed. We even come to accept ADHD into our lives and our families and focus on the gifts despite ADHD. We focus on our children's talents and their accomplishments and love them unconditionally. But we worry about their futures too, the time when they are no longer under our wing and must learn to soar on their own. My son often gives me glimpses of his future and lets me know he's going to be okay. Not just okay, but great even. Quite often these glimpses are hidden in the most brief moments of peace and joy. These times when I am observing him and I am not worried but content and joyful. When he creates something unique, says something insightful, or achieves something so easy for his peers, I can peek into his future and be satisfied. That little moment when I realize I am at peace with ADHD.
