Sony announced the release date today for ModNation Racers: May 25. If you're wondering whether that goes for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Portable version, the answer is "both." As previously reported, the title is set to launch on both platforms, simultaneously, and with similar feature sets. The title is carrying the torch of Little Big Planet's "Play, Create, Share" model, with the ability to create and share custom tracks.The blog also outlined the pre-order incentives for the game, which vary according to retailer. Each of the "Modded," Mighty-Mugg-style racers hails from a well-known Sony franchise (above). GameStop pre-orders will receive Kratos and his "Kart of Chaos."
