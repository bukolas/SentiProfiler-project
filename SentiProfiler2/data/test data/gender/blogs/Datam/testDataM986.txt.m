I could have used that quote last week for blogophilia, but I was unable to comply.

I've written over the years of the stupidity of my customers.  This one I think has to take it all...ya know I've said it before, I thought I've seen it all, but NOPE!

I unexpectedly had to work 14 1/2 hours the other day, and thus being the graveyard shift the lobby wasn't open.  A guy from da "Hood" came to the window and bought a cigarillo, a lighter, and payed for his gasoline.  So I'm watching him.  He's pumping gas and lights up the fricken cigar!  Over the intercom I told him, put it out or I'll stop the pump...He put it out...stupid moron!

I'm pretty much back to almost 40 hours a week...(I'm a happy camper)  But to get the five days in I need to work at another store...the clientelle are totally different then da HOOD peeps.  It's in an industrial area, and the majority of the customers are business people.  Nice, friendly, just want to get their stuff and git outta dodge!

Back at the regular place, I have people constantly ask me..."do you sell milk?"  And I answer...ummm, yes, it's where the sign says COW!

Maybe this little blog'll get my creative juices flowing, my Muse divorced me the past couple of weeks, so maybe I'll have to "court" her and make nicey nicey, 'cuz I really don't like not writing...oh, plus my camera crapped out again!...so it's cell phone pics until I get it fixed...I was smart enough to buy "Insurance" this time...will just take a couple of days to get it back.

So I think the two best Dumb Awards in Da Hood should go to the chick that gave me half a dollar bill and asked if that was worth 50 cents...and actually MEANT it!...and then the dumba$$ that lit up while pumping gas.

Got any better one's then that? 

Requirin' minds wanna know!
