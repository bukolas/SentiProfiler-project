Lately I've been talking to random strangers on the street. Just to get their story, sorta briefly find out who they are. I like to take interest in people's lives. Even strangers. I'm sorry to say, that I didn't talk to this man. At least I took his picture though. &nbsp; In any case, I think it's important to show people that you care about them by simply asking how they are or just listening to what they have to say when they speak. I mean, I don't expect anyone of you to walk up to strangers, lol. I'm just weird like that. But I mean, at least talk to your friends/family. Check up on them. They'll feel good, you'll feel good. And when that happens....well, life is just good. And that can't be bad, because it's good, right? Well anyway. It's Sunday. Have a good week everyone. BUT WAIT, ONE MORE THING. If you like my blog, then I'm sure that you'll like.... Claire au Vietnam xynthian through the looking glass. I thought it looked cool. It didn't come out exactly the way I wanted though. But I still like it. Do you? Although Newark had their protest against education budget cuts yesterday, the rest of California school districts had theirs today. Here are some pictures from Fremont Unified School District's protest that took place on Mowry ave/Fremont blvd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; California schools are protesting the statewide budget cuts that are being made to education as of late. The protests are being organized by the California Teacher's Association (CTA) . This afternoon Newark Memorial high school of Newark, California had their protest. Students and staff walked down Cedar blvd, getting the praise of many in the forms of honks and enthusiastic shouts. At the time of this post, the protest is still going on. But I rushed home so I could post the pictures that I took. You all know me. ;] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nikon F601m/N6000 Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400 Vivtar 35-105mm f/3.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really should invest in a better scanner.

I remember when I had to dissect them in..... 7th grade. I felt bad. It's too bad the autofocus on my digital point and shoot won't allow better focusing than this.&nbsp;
