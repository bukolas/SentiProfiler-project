As we left the catacombs, we thought Benadrix was struck ill.  He collapsed and his breathing came in short gasps. He quickly recovered and told us he had a vision, he could not remember much, but he said he felt anger and saw red. He also thought that he may have glimpsed a dragon. These visions that guide my new friend interest me, I was tought by my dwarven friends the importance of follwoing my own will, but even they hope for visions from Moradin to guide them. How different is that from the guidance of the Mind Flayers? I will not worry myself with it, for now these strange events surrounding Harken are enough. We went to the Old Cliffside Brewery on our return to town, as we had assume we found Old Keller there along with Orek Gernsan, the ranger who we had met was not present.  Both men seemed suprised to see us walk through the door.  We told them how we had routed the goblins, and what we had found in the catacombs, and more importnatnly to Gernsan what we didn't find, his shipments.  Overjoyed and true to his word, Keller paied us the 100 gold promised us the night before.   We spent some time talking to Keller, trying to gather as much information as we could.  So far no villagers have gone missing, and when we told him that the goblins were tied th the Bloodreavers he was not supprised.  It appears Chieg Krand and his Bloodreavers make their home north of Harken, and have been less than desirable neighbors.   We retired to the Inn for the evening.  Aunt Nonie was as supprised to see us return alive as Keller and Gernsan were, she had held our rooms for us, but not her breath.  Before retiering for the evening we agreed once more that we would return to the catacombs in the morning. After a hearty breakfast (for my companions) we headded out to the catacombs, there was no end to the teasing of Benadrix and his feat of streangth with the statue and his inablilty to break down a wooden door.  As we approched the catacombs, two goblins were exiting.  When they saw us they broke for the woods.  We went to make chace but from the forrest exploded a huge black dog, and almost as quickly it burst into smoke.  Moments after the dog vanished an elf woman appeared fromt he brush.  She asked if we had seen a man go this way, she seemed very confused.  We tried to explain to her that the only thing we had going this direction was the dog who dissapeared, but taht we too were on the chase, after two goblins.   She contenued to insist a man had gon this way, and kept repeating a name "Garrek Esh."  After a few minutes of trying we callemd the elf down, and attempted to get her story one more time.  Her name is Cellence, and she is from Sigil the city of portals.  The man she is perusing, this Garrek, has escaped from some sort of prison she called the Harbinger House.  Most of this was lost to me, I had never heard of any of these places, but Marrek seemed to know a little.  His reaction to hearing she came from Sidgil was one of suprise, his knowlegd of it seemed to mosty come from children's stories he was told while growing up.  Knowing the magic nature of Sigil Marrek suggested Cellence should make her way to Thunderspire, a nearby city ruled by wizards.  Cellence asked to accompany us until she found her bearings in our world, aparently taking the portals out of Sidgil is very disorenting. Cellence accompanied us into the catacombs, there was no more signs of goblin activity.  We made our way into the chamber with the pit and locked door.  After a night of rest Gnasc was able to pick the lock on the door.  Inside we found a magic sword, being two handed it was deemed appropreat for Benadrix to carry it.  Perhaps it will serve as a reminder to him next time that his feats of strength should be resurved for locked doors rather than pushing statues into pits.  We removed the debre blocking the other door and followed it into a large underground cavern with a lake in the middle.   We were supprised by some bats, and it took us a moment to gather our witts.  Like clockwork the four of us fell into battle, Cellence must have been shaken from her trip through the portal because her magic seemed to escape her.  As we were about to dispach the final bat, it dove into the lake.   The surface of the lake began to bubble up and a black dragon rose from its depths.  It wasted no time shrowding itself in darkness and attacking.  While most of us stood still struck with fear, the faithful Gnasc (who's scarred body is proof he has seen far worse than a dragon) tried to snap us out of it, only Marrek responded.  The fight with the dragon was tough, it moved around the lake, retreating to the depths at times.  Once during the fight I thought I was finnished but Marrek lept between me and the dragon, scoring a devistating blow to the beast and saving my life.  I did not have time to think about it in the moment, but Cellence must have felt bad during the fight, the neasuea of the portal was still effecting her ability to weild magic.  Marrek delt the killing blow to the dragon, and not a moment too soon, I fear had the fight lasted any longer we all would have perished. In a small cave in the back we found the stolen shipments of Ale from the Clifside Brewery along with a chest containing a gem and a magic dagger.  One of the casks was busted open, fromt he inside.  The remenants of a black dragon's egg was inside this cask, along with a scroll written in Draconic.  It read: "To the vigorous soldier and noble friend Armos Kamroth, I send my most sincere greetings in the name of Tiamat. May you continue in good health and good spirits, most reverend and divinely favored Lord and may my humble gift provide you some aid in your endeavors." We returned to the Cliffside Brewery with the remaining casks of Ale and more than a few questions for Orek Gernsan.  After a bit of questiong it was clear he did not know about the dragon, and he suggested we seek Old keller to help us gain an audience with Baron Stockmer.  We found Keller at Aunt Nonie's, and he agreed to set a meeting for the morning. We setteled in for the night, only to be awaken by the sounds of fighting outside and the glow of fire through our windows.  Arming ourselves we rushed outside to help where we could.  Two bugbears and a handfull of hobgoblins were in the town square, and set upon us as we exited the inn.   It was a gruling fight, the aches from the battle with the dragons were still fresh, just when we thought we had the square cleaned out more of the goblinkin poured into the square.  Benadrix and I were exausted but stood to face the Sub Commander as our friends dispatched the remaining archers.  Merrek acted quickly again this fight and saved Benadrix from sure death at the point of an arrow, this allowed Benadrix to help me finish the Sub Commander.  Even at the end of the battle the night was not won, much of the town was on fire, and the goblins had taken some of the townsfolk prisoner. We found a letter ordering the torching of the town, on the Sub Commander, and that the chared bodies of the dead were to be brought to Thunderspire.  Marrek claime the Commanders sword, clearly a magical weapon.   When the fires were out, we reited back to the inn where Old Keller was waiting for us.  He thanked us again for saving the town and presented me with his shield from his younger days, it is covered in Dwarven and Draconic runes and he explained that it will protect me as well as my allies.  Exausted we headed back to our rooms, the meeting with Baron Stockmer tomorrow seems like an eternity away. Your friend, 148 Marekk Lagonn stood at a crossroads. The Old Kings Road cut through the Nentir Valley. It was crisscrossed by smaller trade routes and mountain paths. It was at one of these intersections that Marekk stood now. His father's sword felt heavy at his waist as he studied the road in front of him. He had left the place of his birth nearly a year ago after making every effort to restore his family's name. Had he given up? Should he have tired harder? Was his father looking down on him now and shaking his head in shame as the last of the Lagonn line wandered the world, lost in more ways than one? Marekk sighed and looked to his trusted companion. The Gnoll stood a few yards back studying the dense forest on either side of the road. Gnasc smelled something in the woods that much he was sure of. The trees were no doubt full of animals but this scent was different, strange. He lifted his massive head and straightened his long ears, straining to hear something. Since Marekk had freed him from that slaving camp he had followed the human on his journey. He seemed to have no clear destination in mind but that didn't bother Gnasc. The man had risked his life to save him from a life of slavery, and Gnasc owed him something. He wasn't sure exactly what, but he was determined to follow Marekk until his debt was paid. A branch broke in the woods to the east and Gnasc's head snapped up in that direction. Marrek's hand shot to his sword handle as he also reacted to the noise. 148 stood in the trees watching the strangers. He'd heard them coming and had chosen to hide along side the road and wait for them to pass. But they hadn't passed. The human and his Gnoll had just stopped at the crossroads. The man seemed to be trying to decide which direction to go next. It was a simple situation and not an uncommon problem, unless you happen to be a magically animated mechanical construct. 148 had never had never known what it was like to choose a path. He was built to serve and fight for his master and that's exactly what he did. Even after being rescued and repaired by dwarves who told him he was now free he still didn't fully understand the concept. They had taken him to the Old King's road and told him to go off and choose his own life. He had simply followed the road with mechanical precision unsure what it meant to choose. Now he sat in the woods watching this human survey the roads ahead of him and he was fascinated. What was going in on in his head? His massive frame shifted in the wet ground and a twig snapped under his weight. When he looked back to the road the human was staring directly at 148, his hand on his sword and the Gnoll seemed to have vanished. Marekk was surprised to see a Warforged emerge from the tree line. The massive war machine walked slowly from the woods his hands raised in the universal symbol of peace. The irony was not wasted on him. He relaxed his sword arm but left his hand resting on the hilt. Gnasc appeared from the shadows behind him. No matter how many times he saw the Gnoll pull this trick it never ceased to impress him. He was just about to ask the machine what exactly he was doing hiding in the woods when he heard a deep laugh from just up the road. Benadrix walked the Old Kings Road completely content. He had been chosen! Thank Kord he had been chosen and his destiny had been made clear. A paladin might serve his entire life and never receive such a profound vision. Kord had showed him the village of Harken and let him know that his future started there. He'd meet a group of travelers on the Old Kings road and together they would go to Harken. as he crested a hill he saw a strange group ahead of him. A human, a Warforged and a Gnoll all arranged in what looked like a standoff. He laughed as he approached them, surely these were the companions Kord had shown him! Marekk watched as the Dragonborn approached their group. He walked right between him and the machine without breaking his swift stride. He guessed that the beast was smiling but the rows of razor sharp teeth made him uneasy. The Dragoborn continued on down road. Without even looking back he said in heavily accented common "What are you all waiting for, Harken is this way!" The warforged looked at the Human and the Gnoll and then walked off after the Dragonborn. Marekk and Gnasc shared a look. This was simply too strange, they had to find out what was going on. Marekk straightened up, adjusted his armor and walked off after the Dragonborn. He looked up at the sky. The horizon was crowded with heavy black clouds. A storm was coming. After a cold day in the rain we came across Harken Village. Looking to warm up and escape the rain we asked for directions to the local pub. We were directed to The Old Cliffside Brewery, and no sooner had we sat down than we were approached by an old dwarf named Keller. Old Keller told us about how the village was being terrorised by a band of goblins, and asked if we could help. He seemed truly concerned, and when it was clear he was speaking for the whole town when he offered us 25 gold each to help rid the town of these goblin raiders. Benadrix tried to squeeze some more gold out of him but Keller said the best he could do is the 25 gold and free food and lodging while we were in town. Marrek agreed first, and predictably Gnasc was quick to agree too. When I agreed that I would help too I was afraid Benadrix would part ways and our short friendship would be over but he too agreed to help the village, but only after he was given a room and a nights rest. Old Keller took us to the only inn in town, Aunt Nonnie's . Keller secured us four rooms, and Aunt Nonnie was clear that it was costing her 5 silver apiece but she was happy to do so if we could rid the town of the goblins. Not needing to sleep I thought about just asking for the silver but I didn't want to cause any problems within our fledgling group. Aunt Nonnie seemed empty except for the four of us so we headed back over to the Old Cliffside Brewery to see if we could gather any more information on these raids. When we entered the pub this time Gnasc noticed an elf in the corner who was spending a little more time looking at us than anyone else in the room. He was also equipped much differently than the locals, with a bow and two fine swords my guess is that he is a ranger. We approached him, thinking he may know more about these goblins than others. He was not very interested in talking and in fact tried to turn use away from his table, until Benadrix convinced him otherwise. If he knew anything he did not let on, talking to him was almost as productive as talking to a wall, even after Marrek bought him a drink. After a few fruitless minutes of trying to talk to him, Marrek went to talk to Old Keller and the bartender, Orek Gernsan . It turns out that the Cliffside Brewery has been hit hard by these raiders, about half of the shipments to neighboring towns have been hit. Gernsan asked us to bring back any of these lost shipments that we may find. After a restful night in the inn, Old Keller took us to the entrance of the catacombs that he believed the goblins were hiding out in. Gnasc snuck in first, I am still amazed at how stealthy he is for being even bigger than me, and checked the room. There were three goblins seated around a table. Eager to prove myself to my friends I rushed in, with them right behind me. We had a bit of a rough fight, especially after two more goblins appeared from the shadows. While it may not have been the prettiest fight we were able to defeat our foes and after searching the room we also found a pouch with 40 gold inside. After a short rest, we followed another hallway where we found some more goblins, one who seemed to have just finished up some kind of ritual. Gnasc was not able to sneak in on this group of goblins. The Hexer in the back of the room summoned some rats, who launched themselves with reckless abandon at us. Benadrix and I quickly tried to make our way to the Hexer thinking he would be the biggest threat in the room, but before we could reach him he summoned two large fire beatles , and Gnasc and Marrek were separated from us by them. We fought hard, and did much better than the previous battle. Though he was bloodied we were unable to stop the Hexer from escaping through a door to another room. Taking a moment to gather ourselves we searched the room, and I found a large gem in the bottom of the brazier. The door the Hexer went through opened up to a large room with a vicious looking statue overlooking a large pit in the floor. There was a large Dire Wolf behind an iron grate, with two goblins standing guard near it. One of them too close to a leaver that most certainly would set the Dire W
lf free. The Hexer was across the room, and there was another even more ornately dressed goblin across the pit from us along with a smaller wolf. There were also quite a few goblins in the room as well. Early on in the fight I was magically pulled into the pit by the Warcaster , and shortly after that Marrek was also dropped into the pit. I helped him escape, and when I managed to climb out my friends had cleared much of the room, and to my relief the Dire Wolf was still caged. I was able to finish off the Warcaster , but the Hexer , while still recovering from our last battle still put up a good fight. He was able to pull the lever to free the Dire Wolf just before he died. The Dire Wolf was in a frenzy by the time the gate opened, but it was so bloodthirsty that it did not put up much of a fight. I felt bad for having to kill the Dire Wolf, but it was so worked up having been caged by those goblins we did not have a choice. We discovered a locked door and while Marrek , Gnasc , and I struggled with it, Benadrix busied himself with pushing the statue into the pit. We were unable to open the door, but we did find a crued map of Harken on the Warcaster with the Brewery marked, along with the estate of Baron Stockmer . There was also a note about capturing villagers for slaves. There was a second door blocked by lots of rubble, clearly done by the goblins. While interested in the door, we were exhausted from the fights and thought it best to warn the town of what we found. We were unable to find any of Gernsan's shipments, but perhaps they are behind the locked door. I am also interested to find out what has the goblins so scared they would block off the door in the last room. I also need to learn more about Baron Stockmer . Also after spending the first years of my life in something like slavery I will not let any of these villagers be subjected to that, I only hope my new friends feel as strongly about this. Your Friend, 148
