At nearly 19 feet long and dripping with what seems like 500 pounds of chrome, the Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum is the biggest, glitziest, most conspicuously consumptive vehicle in General Motorsâ€™ lineup. The stretched ESV variant is almost 20 inches longer than the regular Escalade, with the range-topping Platinum package (available on both lengths) adding a new CTS-inspired grille and front fascia, along with super-bright LED headlights and unique 22-inch wheels.
