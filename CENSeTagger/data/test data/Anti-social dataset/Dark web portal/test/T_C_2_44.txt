Let's say that, by some extraordinarily elaborate statistics, you prove that theft of reindeer herds is committed in 99.99% of cases by the Kuffar and in 0.01% of cases by the non-Kuffar. This, of course, proves that the Kuffar are born reindeer thieves. Your way of reasoning has about the same intellectual value as the one implied by my example.
