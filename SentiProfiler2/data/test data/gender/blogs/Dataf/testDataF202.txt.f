This flat iron is great! I've had mine for 3.5 years now and it hasn't disappointed me yet. I've tried other ceramic irons (CHI, Solia, HerStyler) and they are all quite heavy and start to weigh down on your wrists after straightening for a while. I love that the Sedu is so light and straightens my hair so smoothly and easily! I've recommended this iron to all my friends who want to buy flat irons and they all love theirs too! I have used this Sedu ionic hair straightener for 3 months, my hair has been changed from frizzy to shiny & smooth now. I wanna sincerely thank this hair straightener and I will highly recommend it to my friends, cuz it's really a good tool to renew the hair. I have used many of my friends straighteners after i bought this one. Some straighten faster, but none of them keep my hair as silky as the one i own. My hair feels much less burned using this straightener than using others. It also has a wide range of temperatures. Overall it is a great straightener, but it does take longer than other ones. I have very curly hair so it would take long no matter what. I recommend this straightener, especially to people that don't want their hair damaged easily.
