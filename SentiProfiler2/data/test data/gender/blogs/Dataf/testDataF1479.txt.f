Having mono during school has been really difficult for me. I am constantly tired. Not only is it hard for me to wake up in the morning, it's hard for me to find the motivation to go to class, study and get work done. The doctor said the fatigue could go away in 2 weeks and it could last for 3 months. It's been almost 3 weeks and I feel just as tired as before.

I can already tell that this is not going to be a dean's list semester. I'm disappointed with myself, but I feel so helpless. I can't even ask my teachers for a break because UHS won't give me permission to miss any classes.

Not only is my academic life suffering, but so is my social life and my emotional well-being. I don't have the energy to straighten my hair any more and my self-esteem takes a hit every time I look in the mirror. I think the huge bags underneath my eyes are permanent. The apartment is a mess too, which I can't live with. Cluttered house, cluttered mind. You're supposed to lose weight with mono, but all I can do is sit on the couch and I'm not allowed to exercise, so I fear I'm gaining weight.

I need to turn this around. This is a challenge. If I got dean's list this semester, I would be incredibly proud of myself. I know I shouldn't be straining myself, but I need to push myself because right now, I'm not really pushing myself at all.
