I received a John Tesh daily calendar for Christmas, and more often than not, I can link his messages to my RA life. See if any of these quotes from his calendar don't also apply to you and your RA: May 15 -Feeling Tired? If you're feeling sluggish, drink a glass of water. Experts say one of the first signs of dehydration is fatigue, so down a glass of water to perk up. Have you ever met an RA sufferer that didn't complain of fatigue? Let's give it a shot and see if we don't feel a little more perky. May 14 - Relieve Stress. If you're stressed out, have a popsicle. Why? Stress causes the muscles in your jaw and neck to stiffen, which decreases the amount of blood and oxygen that reaches your brain, and leaves you feeling stressed. But eating something cold relaxes those muscles, and makes you calm down. May 22- Tip to help you calm down. Focus on the good! Whenever you feel anxious, focus on something or someone you appreciate - like your spouse or your pet. Doing that will shift your focus to stress-free thoughts, which will help regulate your heartbeat. And new research shows that keeping your heartbeat rhythms at a smooth rate will short-circuit the tension in your body. Stress is one of my big RA triggers for inflammation. How about you? The next time I see someone eating a popsicle and talking to imaginary friends, I'll just know they're practicing some of John Tesh's techniques to relieve stress and calm down. Just eating a popsicle makes me feel happy and carefree! Add the vision of my smiling little Yorkie dog or my loving husband to the picture, and I shouldn't have a worry in the world! John, you're a genius!
