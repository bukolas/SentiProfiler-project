Quote: bro is Alqassam &amp; hamas are 2 different group..? Kitaeb al-Qassam is the military wing of HAMAS. They are only military, and have nothing to do with what is currently happening. HAMAS gov't is corrupt, and their police force is secular. It is the secular security force that is doing this. I respect the Qassam Brigades, but they receive order directly from the secular gov't, and that is why they cannot carry out martyrdom operations or attack the jews.
