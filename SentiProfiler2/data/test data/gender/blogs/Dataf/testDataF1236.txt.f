Now don't get me wrong, women don't want you to walk up to them and immediately start acting like a sex crazed maniac, but they do want you to open up SOMETIME. Unfortunately most guys never realize this and assume that if they are friendly for long enough something sexual will *just happen*. The truth is it doesn't *just happen* unless you make it happen (remember women want to be lead). Usually if you've met a woman out clubbing/through friends and have spent over 20 hours with her and you haven't yet kissed, your going to be a friend forever (of course this doesn't apply if you work/study with her). Generally it's best to start flirting with a girl as soon as you're even slightly comfortable around each other (after knowing each others names). This sets the tone of the interaction immediately and lets her know that you are a sexual guy who she could possibly date, not another guy to be placed into the "just friends" category.
