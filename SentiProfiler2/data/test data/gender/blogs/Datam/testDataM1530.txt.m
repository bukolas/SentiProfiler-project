precious the movie is a part 3 of a series that is dedicated to the Faces of Domestic Violence. In part 1 of this series I began telling my friends Sara's story that ivolved  emotional and verbal abuse that began with Eli's mother who yelled and Screamed at Eli and his Dad. Eventually this domestic abuse began its vicious cycle and transitioned from Eli be abused by his mom to Eli abuing Sara, his wife.
