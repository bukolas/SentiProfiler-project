Yes. Men do typically lose weight faster and easier than women. This phenomenon is due to a man's on average higher metabolism. A man's higher metabolism comes from a typically higher muscle mass and muscle burns more calories. Also, men are typically larger than women and just maintaining biomass is an increase on calorie demand therefore a calorie burner. On the other side of the coin, women have other biological goals than men do and that would be to have reserves in order to support the creation, development and birth of children as well as provide those children with milk.
