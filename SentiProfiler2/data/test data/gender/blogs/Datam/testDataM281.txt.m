In his collection you can find the tiny Megatron or the Mini Optimus Prime or the micro Starscream.

...and of course they transform. A little cruel LEGO vignette from dbol39. He wrote that he built it for his girlfriend...hmmm don't ask me why. Maybe they broke off or I don't. But it's not to important. Let's see the vig ;) OchreJelly made an amazing LEGO sculpture of the genius Math professor Stephen Hawking. It's so realistic that I didn't need to tell you the name of the model you would instantly know who is it.

Did you know that his book "A Brief History of Time" stayed on the British Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Wowww the proff knows something ;)  These little Pocket Monsters have left their ordinary life for a short time and took a trip to the world of LEGO bricks :)

THX to Amuzu the whole little crew is here: Pikachu, Chimecho, Hikozaru, Wurmple, and the others... Chris Deck has a tone of great Star Wars MINI Models such as an Imperial Star Destroyer, a TIE Fighter, a Death Star or a Droid Starfighter just to name a few. I brought you some of them ;) Have you ever imagined what you get when you xrays a LEGO brick or a minifg? Well Gravitation's medtech friend has been experimenting with it...These are the results: In Japan there's a TV show called Human Tetris. They get bored with playing tetris on the PC, so they play it now in another way (here is a video to see how exactly).

UniqueBuilder got inspiration after watching the show and built this nice LEGO vignette. Guys at BattleBricks.com built a LEGO NXT robot that plays a video game called Wii Bowling. Check out the video to see the robot in action. If you like this little digital mechanism and want to have a same one, here you can find the instructions for building it.
