I own a 9 1/2 year old German Shepherd mix. We believe his father was a black lab with chow mix. His mother was a full-blooded German Shepherd.Fred is a great dog. He weighs 110 lbs. so you can't ever pick him up and his meds cost a fortune, but he's worth every time. I watch a lot of Court TV and I feel much more secure having Fred in the house with me!He's settled down a lot over the years. He used to be much more high strung and jumped on people, etc. Now he just barks a lot. He's definitely the alpha dog of our family.
