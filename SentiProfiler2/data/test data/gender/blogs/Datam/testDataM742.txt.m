Since I am aging and becoming Totally Old, I would like a throbbing forehead vein like Clint Eastwood and various telekinetic manga characters. A throbbing forehead vein - is that too much to ask? If I had a rec room, I would want either a swanky home bar with Christmas lights and old school beer signs or a massive model railroad set. And if I had a 10,00,000 square foot rec room? I would want something like Miniatur Wonderland (pronounced "mini-ah-toor vunderland") in Hamburg, Germany, the largest model railway in the fricking world. If I couldn't have my own Miniatur Wonderland - because I'm not building that thing - I would settle for Minotaur Wonderland, a magical realm of daydreams and lollypops and prancing minotaurs, or a massive retractable roof in my huge rec room so Harrier jets and my rocketpack commandos could land. I've said it many times: one must have goals in life. Miniatur Wonderland: give to me! June 15, 2009 - Los Angeles after the Lakers' NBA Championship win. June 15, 2009 - Tehran after sham elections and murderous crackdown on protesters. Being a cop in the future would be bad-ass. You get to wear riot gear, fly around on jet packs, and whack civilians with sick sticks or stun guns. Future cops also get the coolest rides - at least in science fiction movies. Here are the most kick ass and suck ass futuristic police vehicles ever, according to Me.- Police Spinner - Blade Runner Designed by the legendary Syd Mead, the police spinner is a ground/air patrol car loaded with 300 lbs of red and blue beacon lights. Judging from the picture above, the spinner is powered by steam vents and suspension wires. Who drives it: Edward James Olmos , puta . Why it is cool: Look at it. It's fucking cool, Syd Mead designed it. The spinner was created using practical effects and a full scale prop, which automatically makes it cooler than any digitally created futuristic police vehicle. Why it sucks: The spinner has scissor doors that open vertically (see above) which just lets in all that futuristic acid rain. The Pursuit Special - Mad Max and Road Warrior This tricked out, all black 1974 Ford Falcon XB coupe gets jacked by Max in Mad Max for his mission of vengeance, and he just keeps the thing during the subsequent biker apocalypse in the Road Warrior . With a 351 V8 engine, a gnarly blower, and double spoilers, it is pretty much one giant surrogate penis. Often incorrectly identified as a "V8 Interceptor" due to a line of dialogue spoken by a mechanic in Road Warrior, it is actually identified as a Pursuit Special in Mad Max , so that's what I'm calling it and oh God I have no life. Who drives it: Max Why it is cool: I just explained why it's cool. The Pursuit Special is the automotive wet dream of an entire generation of Aussie gearheads . Why it sucks: N/A MFP Interceptor - Mad Max Some time in the not to distant future the Australian federal highway police force known as the Main Force Patrol will cruise the badlands in bright yellow 1974 Ford Falcons. It will happen, mark my words. In 1979's Mad Max , our hero Max Rockatansky drive the bad ass V8 Interceptor - at least until he graduates to the Pursuit Special. Who drives it: Officer Max Rockatansky . His name is on the side of his Interceptor, as well as his nickname: "The Dark One." Why it is cool: For starters, the color scheme is awesome. Lettering on the back of each patrol car reads either PURSUIT or, in Max's case, INTERCEPTOR. Plus, the car appears in Mad Max , the mother of all dystopian futuristic highway patrol revenge flicks. Why it sucks: This is what I'm telling you, it doesn't suck. It's not quite as cool as the Pursuit Special, though, is it? Hill Valley Police Squad Car - Back to the Future II In the year 2015, female police officers will patrol the town of Hill Valley in hover-equipped squad cars and futuristic motorcycles. The cops in Back to the Future II don't seem to be terribly effective, but they have sweet rides. Who drives it: Unit N11-11 (below) Why it is cool: The sloping, aerodynamic pod shape of the Hill Valley PD squad cars are the main selling point. They look like melted jelly beans. Why it sucks: They don't do anything particularly spectacular, and the special effect sequence (pictured) of the hovering squad car looks dated. I'm nitpicking. Lawmaster motorcycle - Judge Dredd The Lawmaster is the vehicle of choice for MegaCity One's fascist Judges, who enforce strict bans on things like sugar and coffee. Normal motorcycles aren't cool enough for Judges - they prefer cruising around in these tricked out, unwieldy Lawmaster monstrosities. Why? Because they look bad ass. Who drives it: Judges Why it is cool: Look at that thing, it's ridiculous. The design is so over the top that you have to love it. It's like a jumbo action figure accessory. Why it sucks: I think it needs much fatter tires in order to look truly cool. San Angeles Police Patrol Car - Demolition Man The pathetically ineffectual pacifistic cops of the futuristic megalopolis of San Angeles roll around in cool carbon-fiber police cars looking for kittens to rescue or trash to pick up. That's how they roll in the Sylvester Stallone film Demolition Man , which features GM Ultralite low emission concept cars. Maybe GM should have been making these things instead of Hummers, n'est - ce pas? Who drives it: Sandra Bullock Why it is cool: As Stallone demonstrates, if you crash one of these babies, the inside is instantly filled with expanding crash foam that absorbs the impact. That's a nice feature, unless you have issues with being entombed in asphyxiating foam. Why it sucks: See "who drives it." NYPD Cruiser - The Fifth Element The production design in Luc Besson's could-have-been-awesome The Fifth Element is clearly the flim's greatest redeeming feature - that and Gary Oldman's crazy haircut. One of the great things about Fifth Element is the use of models and practical special effects for their hover cars - as a result, they look more solid and real than CG effects. Who drives it: Cops in ridiculously bulky outfits . Why it is cool: I like the retro-futuristic vibe these vehicles have. If Dick Tracy was a 23rd century cop he would totally drive one of these babies. They come equipped with neat communications gear, a handy sliding side door and a winch/pulley system for mid-air prisoner transfer. Why it sucks: They look a little bloated, like pregnant Spinners, but I think that was the effect the filmmakers were going for. Iowa State Patrol hovercycle - Star Trek A couple things you need to know about Future Iowa: a) it's a desert wasteland, b) it has deep canyons/quarries, and c) it's patrolled by motorcycle cops. Who drives it: Scary cyborg looking cops on hoverbikes who like the Beastie Boys. Why it is cool: While the scene in question may be more than a little goofy, the hoverbike design is cool as hell. Why it sucks: Come on, a 23rd Century rocket bike can't catch a kid in an antique car? Laaame . PreCrime Hovership - Minority Report This one kind of blurs the line between police car, helicopter, and hair dryer. Regardless, the hover units in Minority Report do qualify as futuristic police vehicles, so I'll throw them in. It doesn't mean I have to like it. Who drives it: Dept. of PreCrime officers. You thought I was going to make a Scientology joke, didn't you? Too easy. Why it is cool: I don't know, they're kind of neat looking I guess. They do look a little familiar... Why it sucks: Let's just say Boba Fett is suing for copyright infringement. Idiot Cop Car - Idiocracy I'll be honest, I haven't actually seen Idiocracy but I'm including this futuristic police vehicle because I'm in love with the logo. Who drives it: Idiots. Why it is cool: Look at that logo! That is straight pimpin '. Why it sucks: Does it suck? The blinged out logo alone redeems the vehicle. Riot Control Garbage Truck - Soylent Green In the future, you'll be so goddamn hungry you won't even ASK where your food comes from. Who drives it: 14th Precinct Riot Control cops / food industry workers. Why it is cool: It scoops up hippies, dumps them in the back, and then makes food out of them. That's hot. Why it sucks: There are starving kids in China! Stop criticizing the Riot Control Garbage Trucks and eat your soylent green, youngster! Sandman Ground Car - Logan's Run TV series Sure, the 1976 film Logan's Run was awesome, but do you remember the spin-off TV series? They ran with the original concept but surgically removed everything about the original movie that made it unique and cost money. Instead of taking place in a bizarre future city with expensive sets, the Logan's Run TV show took place almost entirely in a park in Southern California. Cool car, though. Who drives it: The ground car was driven by Sandmen, fascist cops who ensure population control by making sure that everyone who reaches the age of 30 takes a once-in-a-lifetime spin on the lethal Carousel. Why it is cool: The Ground Car has a charming antiquated futuristic design and lots of stickers! The gull wing doors scream THIS CAR IS TOTALLY FROM THE FUTURE. Why it sucks: It's called a "Ground Car," which seems redundant. I bet the Sandmen also have Water Boats and Sky Airplanes. Detroit Police Patrol Cars - Robocop Rumour has it that Robocop was supposed to drive his own custom police car in the 1987 film Robocop , but director Paul Verhoeven thought the Robocar looked stupid. As a result, our cyborg hero and the Detroit Police drive black 1985 Ford Taurus in the film. Man, the Robocar must have been pretty shitty if this was a better choice. Who drives it: The police of the future! Why it is cool: Umm ... I'm drawing a blank here. Why it sucks: It's a Ford Taurus. ' Nuff said. Grammaton Cleric Pimpmobile - Equilibrium I'm a big fan of Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium , flaws and all. It's got sword fights, gun kata , and a brooding ultra-serious Christian Bale (as opposed to campy, flamboyant Christian Bale). Set in the city-state of Libria where emotions are illegal, Equilibrium focuses on the anti- emo cops know as Grammaton Clerics who roll around in white Cadillacs - the car of the future! Who drives it: Christian Bale, Taye Diggs , Sean Bean. Why it is cool: It's all white? And therefore looks futuristic? Why it sucks: Man, it's like they're not even trying, isn't it? Look at those guys (above). They're embarrassed to be seen riding in the thing. Clearly the producers just didn't have the money to create their own custom cars, so they worked with what they had - and what they had were white Caddies, which are one step up from the pink Cadillacs that Mary Kay cosmetic salespeople drive. Sad. -I didn't include Will Smith's Space Audi from I, Robot because although he is a police detective, he's driving a civilian car, not a marked police car. Same goes for the cool Lexus concept car Tom Cruise drives in Minority Report - not a cop car. Mick Jagger's armored personnel carrier in Freejack doesn't make the list because it's more of a paramilitary vehicle and it is driven by Mick Jagger. Remember when Sam Raimi used to make horror movies? Apparently so does Sam Raimi. Drag Me To Hell is a return to Raimi's schlock horror roots, and that can only be a good thing. Yes, it's a PG-13 horror flick and as a result it sometimes feels like Raimi is holding back on the really sick shit (which we'll get on the unrated DVD version), but I didn't feel like I was watching a watered down Evil Dead movie. Drag Me works despite its relative lack of gratuitous gore and an anemic performance by the lead actress. And do you know why? Because it's a balls-out Sam Raimi horror movie! It's creepy and gross and hilarious and most of all it's just a lot of fun. Need convincing? In this film a toothless corpse gums our screaming heroine's chin while drooling embalming fluid all over her. A stapler is used as a melee weapon. Somebody pukes up an entire kitty. A scarf goes bad. And when a goat shows up in the third act, you just know things are going to go terribly, hilariously wrong. Go check it out. You can't complain about Spider-Man 3 if you don't show up when Raimi actually makes awesome movies. I often look at footage of the wildfires that sweep through the western states and think, "If only we had giant fire fighting robots." I'm not alone, evidently, because designer Jordan Guelde has created plans for a monstrous bright orange arboreal automaton that fights wild fires. The robot is designed to eliminate the fuel that wild fires need to grow - in other words, it chops down trees. Sure, you and I can chop down trees with a chainsaw or axe, but we require things like oxygen and lack of fire to do so. The Forest Fire Clear Cut Robot laughs at our human weakness. It can chop down trees faster and do it more safely than a human crew - theoretically at least. Right now it's just a bunch of pretty computer graphics. But when they start building these things? I want one! Give to me. He's a ten foot super giant with ginger hair and a neck as thick as a Sequoia. He's Stardust, one of the proto-superheroes that appear in Supermen!: The First Wave of Comic Book Heroes 1939-1941 by Greg Sadowski, and he is creepy as hell. Supermen! features an assortment of obscure early superhero comics produced in 1939-41. The comics are glorious, primitive works of pulp science fiction, crude ancestors of the modern superhero. Yet there's something vital and imaginative about these unsophisticated comics which clumsily explore superhero stories and ideas long before they calcified into cliche. And holy shit, some of those early superheroes were bizarre and terrifying. Stardust is certainly unnerving, but nothing matches the sheer weirdness of Fantomah, the face-melting heroine. Like many "heroes" of her time, Fantomah had seemingly unlimited supernatural powers that she used to protect her jungle domain, but what set her apart was her tendency for her face to transform into a hideous grinning skull. Bleach blonde skull face woman! She is a nightmare. Stardust, on the other hand, embodies an entirely different type of weirdness. He's a red haired space giant who lives in a space castle and saves Earth from giant vultures - from space. Stardust's super powers are all over the map, ranging from flight to the ability to transform enemies into worms to a deep, penetrating, inappropriate stare. He also has a HUGE, baby swallowing neck. If Stardust ever perished in the Sahara, scavengers would fight over Stardust's thick, juicy neck. You could feed a pack of hyenas with that neck meat. He should change his name to Neckro. Or Golden Throat. Or Dr. Bigneck. Anyway, you can really get an idea of how freakishly huge Stardust's neck is when the hero saves a helpless and unnamed girl from the space vultures: Nameless Girl, look out! Stardust wants to swallow you! I honestly can't tell if Stardust is meant to be that frickin' huge, or if the artist just had no concept of proportion and perspective whatsoever. Regardless, the end result is strangely compelling. After wiping out the space vultures, Stardust returns to the girl (who begins every phrase with the word "oh") and , looming uncomfortably close and staring at her, he invites her back to his space castle. "Oh, Stardust! I'd be crazy about it!" I'm guessing that Stardust routinely "rescues" women like Oh Girl, takes them back to his star, feeds them fattening foods for a few months, and then eats them. That's just how superheroes rolled back in the late Thirties. Sure, Barack Obama is the first African American president, but did you know that he is also the first laser powered president ? No shit, Obama is powered by a combination of moxie, hope, and 100% pure laser energy. I am totally not making this up. I have proof: poorly Photoshopped stock photographs of the President! Behold Laser Obama.
