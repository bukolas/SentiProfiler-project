Six years later I lay at night and think about love and I have moved on to find happiness cause that's what she would have wanted. There is some one that I do love now, and would give her my heart. I know I'm not handsome or the man that I was 6 yrs ago with my looks. But my heart is big and kind. I would never be mean to her nor make her feel sad or down. I would give her the world and so much happiness if she would be mine. I know she's been hurt and afraid but with me I would protect her and be there every day. I lay awake and count the stars wondering why I've been alone for so long. I would give her my heart cause its who she is that I care so much about. For my heart beats for her. I just wonder if her heart will beat next to mine.
