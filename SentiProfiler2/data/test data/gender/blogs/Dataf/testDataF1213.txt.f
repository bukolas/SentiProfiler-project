The last time I visited CDO, again on a business trip and alone, I took my breakfast in this homey eating place where I also did a little shopping of beautiful household accessories and fashion trinkets. While waiting for my food to be served, I picked out a large native bag and a mat, among other things, paid for it and went back to the adjoining room where my order was invitingly sitting on the table.  The Shrimp Linguine was simply delectable while I sipped the Carrot Citrus shake.  How I loved it!
