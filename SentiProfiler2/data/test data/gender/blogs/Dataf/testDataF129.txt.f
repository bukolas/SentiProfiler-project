A brief reconstruction of the event in question (partially for your information, but more for my memory):

Monday, January 11th: went into early labor on my own.
3pm: reported for pre-scheduled doctor's appt. She decided to let me go home and get some rest, and fully expected me to end up in the hospital prior to the 5am induction time.
Evening: actually slept through contractions, thanks to some good drugs :)

Tuesday, January 12th
5am: reported for scheduled induction. 4 cm dilated but with an irregular contraction pattern, so pitocin was started.
8am(ish): epidural started.
8:15am: Left side numb. Right side totally normal. Epidural redosed.
8:30am: Totally numb with a blood pressure of 64/48. A few shots later, I was coherent again and had a more appropriate blood pressure.
8:30am - 3:45pm: Repeat. Got an epidural redose at some point with another corresponding drop in blood pressure. Blood pressure also dropped every time they had me change position. Learned the warning signs so that I could tip the nurses off before it got too low. Contractions did their job so by 3:45, I was almost 10cm dilated.
3:45pm: Epidural starting to wear off a bit. Didn't want a redose (nor did the doc want to do it) because I was so close to pushing; plus, I didn't want to be passing out while trying to push, given my track record.
4pm: 10cm dilated, got the OK to push. Baby at 0 station.
4pm-6pm: Pushing. A lot. Eventually they gave me a good drug in my IV to curb the nausea and vomiting (always a challenge when trying to push at the same time!).
5:55pm: Baby still at 0 station. PA confirmed for my OB that the baby had not moved at all since I began pushing 2 hours earlier. OB said "We only let people push for 3 hours if there is no progress being made. You can push for another hour but I really think we're going to end up doing a c-section regardless." Me: "Well, let's do it now then". OB was also concerned that the baby could be much larger than we expected.
6pm: Epidural wore off completely. Got to experience the joy of having severe contractions less than 30 seconds apart while not being allowed to push and with no pain relief while the anesthesiologist finished an epidural on another patient. Matt and my mom were provided with surgical attire and packed room in a mad dash. And then we waited.
6:25pm: Anesthesiologist finally arrives. Pain medication administered. Able to catch breath.
6:30pm: arrived in OR.
6:40pm: Joshua William was born :) He came out grabbing onto the surgeon's tools...and they couldn't get him to let go! Turned out that he was face up, which was why he wasn't able to descend (and was only 7lbs 9oz, so not huge after all!). My OB said I almost certainly would have ended up with a c-section regardless.

Due to some severe shoulder pain from the c-section (something about air in my abdominal cavity irritating a nerve), they ended up sedating me after Josh was born, so I remember seeing Matt holding him next to me and very little else from the next 2 hours. Arrived in my room in postpartum around 9pm.

Ironically, though not the smoothest of days, I am so grateful that Josh arrived safely and is healthy that I would do it all again if I had to. God provided much grace and I have been healing much more quickly than I anticipated. God is good.
