Today was one of those I should really get up and do something, but I don't wanna kind of days! So I didn't! I Hung out with my wonderful husband and sweet kids. 

Poor Hunter came home from his sleepover really sick. As soon as he walked in our front door I knew he was sick! Then I felt him and I he said "Mom, I feel terrible." He broke my heart. He is running a fever and has a bad cough. If I don't see an improvement in him by tomorrow, I'm going to take him to the ER. Hunter is so thin and frail as it is because he isn't the best eater, so we kind of panic when he gets sick at all.

Anyway, other then Hunter being sick, our weekend is lazy and good! I like it when Mark is off work and the kids are home from school and we can all just be together. Our weekdays are so crazy and busy, so the weekends are a time to be together.

Everyone is gathered around the t.v. right now watching America's Most Wanted. Okay, I know not the best family show, but we all love COPS and America's Most Wanted and we never miss it on Saturday night.
