I bought it for my friend daughter. I have two Britax car seats, the Decathalon and Roundabout.  These car seats seem to be the safest on the market.  I feel incredibly comfortable putting my children in these seats and they seem to provide the support in all the right places.  I also love how incredibly easy these are to clean.  I take them out every so often and vacumn them out completely and they look (almost) new.  The belt is very smooth moving, especially when you press the button to give you more belt when strapping the child in.
