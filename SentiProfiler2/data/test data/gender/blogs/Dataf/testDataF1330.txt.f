This week's tag was captured by John. Unlike some tags, there's little debate over what the tag is trying to convey - Peace for All! Lovely sentiments! Last week it really felt as if spring had arrived - even the sidewalks were shouting out that spring had sprung! Well, as anyone who has lived in this area for any amount of time knows, it is waaaaay too early to pack up those coats, hats and gloves. Fortunately, at least according to the AccuWeather forecast, after today, things will start improving again and the forecast is for fair skies and pleasant temperatures for the rest of the week. That's a good thing since Wednesday is St. Patrick's Day - although it's not an official holiday, in Lakewood it does appears to be a day when many people take the day off - perhaps as a "mental health day." The light grows stronger in March, perhaps it is the light which inspires the caretaker to spring clean. The garden is being prepared - the tall dried grass has been cut, the ground is bare and awaits for the evolution of spring. A squirrel has come to help the gardener and finds a wayward acorn. To see all the snaps of the second Sunday statue series go here . Yesterday while I was wandering about I met little Jenny (mixed breed puppy) and her new family. It was Jenny's first day with her new family. In addition to coming into a loving human family, Jenny will benefit from being adopted into a family with a wise and older dog Jack (seen above). As I was leaving Jenny and her family, more neighbors came up to welcome Jenny into the hood - this time a big, friendly dog and two of his humans. Today's Skywatch Friday photos were taken in the Birdtown district of Lakewood. Birdtown is Lakewood's oldest neighborhood and is home to many beautiful churches, most of the churches were founded by various immigrant groups who settled in Lakewood to work in the factories which dominated the Birdtown District. The three churches pictured today are all located on Quail Street and include St. Gregory the Theologian and Northcoast Baptist Church (above) and St. Nicholas Ukrainian Orthodox Pro-Cathedral (right). To read more about the history of Birdtown check out this wonderful website which is sponsored by the city of Lakewood. Another excellent account of the history of Birdtown can be found on this website , sponsored by the Lakewood Historical Society. To see more photos of the sky around the world visit here! Today's theme for TT is HATS! In keeping with the S nap's established Theme Thursday tradition today's puzzler takes us to an emporium of delights. Who can name this classy store which sells pretty much anything one could possibly desire? I will provide a hint in the figure of Eddie, one of the store's owners, the store is not named after Eddie, but is named after his charming wife. Eddie strikes a pose in front of just a few of the store's many hats which are displayed above his own hatless head. As you begin to wander through the store you will encounter one treasure after another - who knows you may even encounter a hat or two in the most unexpected places! The store specializes in furniture, jewelry , pottery, and glassware. The store is opened six days a week - Monday through Saturday, 11 AM to 6:00 PM. This evening after all the Snap readers have a chance to play today's puzzler, I will come back to add the name and location of today's site to today's post - and I hope the next time you are near it you will pop in and take a wander, I'm sure you won't be disappointed, and if you are like me will be sure to find something that you just had to take home! Addendum: Anonymouse nailed the store right off! congratulations! This delightful shop which is owned and operated by Eddie and Connie Dean is called Connie's Classics . It is located in the Birdtown District of Lakewood at 12603 Madison Avenue. Stop in and tell them that you read about them on the Snap! Tuesday was an absolutely beautiful day! Here's a few snaps from my walk around town. I met a few Lakewood students who graced me with an impromptu concert! This young man strikes a pose and and diverts my eye from watching the tow truck. Word to the wise - don't forget to feed those parking meters and obey the parking rules. The Lakewood traffic enforcement patrol is serious! No parking worries when a skateboard is one's main means of transportation! What came into your head when you first saw this plate? The first thing that I thought of was "one left to leave" - possibly meaning the person driving this car has one kid was still at home. And, if this is the message, are we to assume that the driver of the car is looking forward to the day when all the kids are on their own or is this a statement of anticipatory grief? However, soon I thought of another possible message - what did you think of? Inquiring minds would love to know.
