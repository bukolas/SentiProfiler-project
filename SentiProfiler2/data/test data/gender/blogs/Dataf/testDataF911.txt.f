I guess you could forgive someone for looking twice in a mirror. Maybe to verify their perception of it the first time. But this was different. I stopped, turned around, walked back and then proceeded to waste fourteen and a half minutes attempting to catch my reflection at it's own game. I think our reflections are more than the shallow, beauty-obsessed clones of us they seem to be. That's a fair observation to hold mind, I mean what do we ever see our reflections doing?

Combing their hair, applying lipstick, adjusting their skirt 'just-so'. Really? No i think there's more to them. It just seems so close minded to assume their only purpose is to help us maintain our unique level of good-looking-ness (and I can only speak for myself here but I don't even remember the last time I had a successful view of my reflection). Perhaps we all have a little Dorian Gray in us. Perhaps we all use them for our own selfish ends. Maybe we do maybe we don't, I guess I'm not sure what we use them for. It's just nice to know when you feel completely alone, there's an equally frustrated person on the other side of the looking glass, albeit she'll likely have better hair than you do..
