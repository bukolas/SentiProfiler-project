The weather's turned, and the old neighbors creep out from their crammed rooms to blink in the sun, as if surprised to find they've lived through another winter.

Though steam heat's left them pale and shrunken like old root vegetables,
Mr. and Mrs. Tozzi are already hard at work on their front-yard mini-Sicily:
a Virgin Mary birdbath, a thicket of roses, and the only outdoor aloes in Manhattan.
It's the old immigrant story, the beautiful babies grown up into foreigners. Nothing's turned out the way they planned as sweethearts in the sinks of Palermo. Still, each waves a dirt-caked hand in geriatric fellowship with Stanley, the former tattoo king of the Merchant Marine, turning the corner with his shaggy collie, who's hardly three but trots arthritically in sympathy. It's only the young who ask if life's worth living, notMrs. Sansanowitz, who for the last hour has been inching her way down the sidewalk, lifting and placing her new aluminum walker as carefully as a spider testing its web. On days like these, I stand for a long time under the wild gnarled root of the ancient wisteria, dry twigs that in a week will manage a feeble shower of purple blossom, and I believe it: this is all there is, all history's brought us here to our only life to find, if anywhere, our hanging gardens and our street of gold:
cracked stoops, geraniums, fire escapes, these old stragglers basking in their bit of sun.
