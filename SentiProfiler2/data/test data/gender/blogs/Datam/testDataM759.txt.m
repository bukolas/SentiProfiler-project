Sometimes a simple "WTF" will not suffice and you just gotta sat out loud... WHAT THE FUCK?! Bran There's a fine line between a Make A Wish Telethon and a David Lynch film. Bran Only an African-American legend like Sidney Poitier could have had the skill, sensitivity and all out brass balls to direct a film with such delicate and controversial subject matter. I can only imagine how good Mo' Money could have been under the thoughtful guidance of Morgan Freeman or maybe even as Al Sharpton's directorial debut. Bran Ah, Cruising . You taught me so much. You opened my eyes to the sweet hip shakin' moves that I will use for the rest of my life. Most importantly, you gave me the ever so valuable lessons in hanky code. Want a fist in your bum? Red hanky, right pocket. Wanna pee on a stranger? Yellow hanky, left pocket. "I love it when we're cruisin' together ." Bran Working at a video store, I used to try and sell this film like this: "Hey, you liked Running Man right? Yeah? Well you'll love this. It's exactly like Running Man except instead of it taking place in the future, it takes place during the Depression. Instead of cool laser fights and reckless violence there is slow dancing and some light tandem jogging. Instead of Schwarzenegger, you get a young Red Buttons . Sound like a winner?" Bran Hey, I'm an 7 year old facing adversity in the ghetto and I just won the Kentucky Derby. Sounds great, but have you ever lifted a fucking boat over a fucking mountain? No? Get back to me when you have. Bran Seriously, shit is really like this on Mars. My dad told me. His slow pitch baseball team used to play away games on Mars and he swears he saw at least one tripple tittied lady at the pub. Don't call my dad a liar, he fought in the space wars! Or was it 'Nam? Wait, neither. Sorry. Bran Whenever I listen to Frank Stallone's "Far From Over", I always feel like I should go for a jog. Bran
