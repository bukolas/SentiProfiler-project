About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went to Prestatyn in Wales with my mum, stepdad, sister and brother. When we got there I wanted to go home because it was a lot busier than where we went to last year ( borth ). Anyway I stayed and I gradually got used to it. A few days later I wanted to go on the go-karts but I was nervous. So my stepdad and my brother went on first and then my stepdad and my sister went on 2nd, then finally I went on, I had I great time and because I did it I went on loads more times ( about 4 times ) throughout the holiday. I loved walking on the beach and going into the water. So I had a great time. Thanks Mum and Stepdad for paying. Thanks for reading ,bye.
