I met a friend at McDonalds for breakfast this morning...yeah, I actually got up early on my day off...go figure!

February in Phoenix is like a Spring day in Ohio...I woke up and the weather was cool, but great.  Less then a month left, and I will have lived here for a year, it's hard to believe.

Okay, so I met up with Brad, and we sat down and just chatted and caught up with what's happened since the last time we met (Which was a couple of months ago, I just see him for a few minutes at work a couple times a week, can't really talk all that much then.)

So I'm drinking my HOT coffee without the lid, and this lady doesn't sit down "Lady like" on the seat behind me, she just PLOPS down real hard.  Hard enough for me to bounce off my seat and feel the HOT liquid spill all over the table AND my thighs.  (I'm not an 80 yr old woman, but I wonder if I can sue Mickey Dee's for faulty booths?!?...just sayin')

Brad and I just laughed at the sight of the coffee all over the table, and sopped it up with napkins and continued our talking...and then it started.

Well before "IT" started, the lady would get up, and Brad would give me eye contact indicating that she was going to sit down again.  It got to the point where I put the coffee out of harms way...in other words on the other side of the table out of my hands!

THEN it started!...she had to have had a lot of nervous energy, because my seat started shaking, I think to the point of where Brad even saw me bouncing up and down.  (I'm not even kidding!).  We decided to move to another table, and I looked back at her, and sure enough her leg was bouncing up and down.  We dumped our trays and sat in a more peaceful environment.

So my adventures in eating at the McCafe!

So requirin' minds wanna know, have you experienced something similar to this in your dining adventures?
