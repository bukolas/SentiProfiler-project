So to start this off, it was just a normal day. I hung with my friends all day, and had a blast. Well, we all decided to drink that night. So I got some alcohol, and invited some people over to have a little get-together. Bad idea. It was about 1am, and the cops got called for a noise disturbance. Obviously, we were being loud but, personally, I didn't feel we were. Well as you all know, when a minor is intoxicated, they automatically get an MIP. Well, everyone in my room got one. Which I find completely unfair considering the fact that everyone in the house, except my Grandmother, was drinking. Well, once everyone went home, I was laying there thinking. Thinking if this is truly how I want my life to be. If I wanted to grow up with a criminal record. If I wanted to grow up an alcoholic. If I wanted to grow up not knowing if my life could be any better then what it is.
