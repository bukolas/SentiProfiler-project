scammed!!!!   ok... this is what i want you to do... imagine with me here... it wont be hard, trust meâ€¦  you were tired, frustrated, so much that you almost gave a serious thought to becoming a hippie (also known as junkie in some cultures), but only got drunk and puked and lost all hope and you drowned in the alcohol swirl (you know what i mean, its hard to put that in words, i'm talking about the feeling where you feel like sleeping and wanting to stay awake and not say anything but talk to someone all at the same time, you know, yes you do... ). morning, woken up by a phone call (stay with me, the realization of the situation is necessary to justify what is gonna happen)... yes this is him...huh..."you have just been chosen to be the winner of a 1000$ gift card and that it'll be sent to you, just give your address for shipping"... shock, pause, brainwaves: could this be finally one of those moments when the stint of bad luck is over and the wheels have finally turned and the "new day" has dawned, and you say what the heck why not. If the situation was any different I would've analyzed the whole situation and observed the fact that she mentions that i was chosen in a draw conducted by VISA, the company that is on your credit card, of which i hold a debit card, and they already have my address on file, so why bother calling me n asking something which they should already know? But, as it turns out, $1000 is a pretty big amount, and its just address, what're they gonna do, send me a packet of Anthrax??!!!

Here, can i sleep now??!! No, you have also won along with it a subscription for 2 magazines every week, and you need to chose which magazines from a list of 60. Hmmm... ok... how bad can it be?!! I can always use some magazines, they look good in your bathroom, which also has a toilet, and a flush tank, with cover, over which you can keep them!! So what do you have!?? ESPN (sports, hmmm, a way to gain enough knowledge to stop those ManU fans in their tracks when they get offensive, which they always are, because they feel pity for the team that died, and think that they have somehow resurrected from ruins, and what not, sure they are on top of EPL, but thats because they have a lot more money, which is because of you (manU fans) !!), and National Geographic traveller (ooh, that'd be good, I can atleast learn about the places where I would go when I have enough money to buy Hawaii!!), GQ (now that was literally born to be in a bathroom!!!), etc etc (you thought I'm gonna list all 60 didn ya??) 

now wait a second and i'll connect ya to our sales department... sure... hi this is AssHole, how can i help ya... well i was connected by AssHole(female), (something you'll notice, these guys always make sure they mention their names, like they are very unique and somehow is a sign of gaining trust, hello sir, good morning, this is Ben, how can i help ya, well i feel so comfortable already that i want to ask if he is the ben from Ben 10??!!), and she was mentioning about some magazine n some gift card. Yes, i'd be glad to help you now, let me explain, you can chose 3 magazines every week, you just have to pay for the delivery, which is 3.45$ a week, and you can get the magazines for the next 60 months (5 yrs!!!), now to make your life easier, we will charge you 50$ every month for the next 20 months, and pay nothing for the next 40. Now i can go ahead and book your order right now, would you like to use a VISA or a MasterCard?!!

ok hold, i thought this was free, m not gonna give my credit card number to someone who just called me in the morning and promise to send me something, and ask for it, what did you say the name of your company is?!! Blue whale publications, me googling as soon as he said it, and sure enough, more scam alerts than a legit website... thank you sir for your offer, but i'll buy those magazines myself... 

This is a post intended to increase awareness, and protect your personal identity, and your money, and your sanity, and your account, and your money, oh i said that already... so thats all that you can save... 

Me in my last 6 months here in the United States have been either a victim of or was almost a victim of about 4 scams/mishaps. sure enough, m gonna put em all up, after all my biggest fans, Me n Myself, deserve to know about it...
