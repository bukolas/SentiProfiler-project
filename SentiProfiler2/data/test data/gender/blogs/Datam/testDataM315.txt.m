Cardigans are another wardrobe must have. And they have had a bit of a comeback lately too, not that they ever really went out of style but more and more designers seem to have them in their collections. Cardigans are great if you aren't a sport jacket kind of guy or if you are feeling more casual. They are perfect for transitional weather like in spring. They come in so many styles from slim fitting and modern to more traditional. There is nothing like the feel of cashmere. And when mixed with cotton, it's equally as soft but much less expensive. This cardigan has a modern cut with a few modern touches like the contrast trim and elbow patches. This is the type cardigan that both you or your dad could wear. It's just a matter of how you wear it. I love the color. What a great cardigan to wear with jeans. Although it's a bit of a splurge, it's the kind of piece that you would could wear year round. If you are fan of argyle patterns, then you may like this cardigan. It's definitely more interesting than your average cardigan. This cardigan is definitely versatile and so soft. You could wear this with jeans and a tee or with dress pants and a button-down shirt. I am a big fan of Banana Republic for bringing us designer looks for less.
