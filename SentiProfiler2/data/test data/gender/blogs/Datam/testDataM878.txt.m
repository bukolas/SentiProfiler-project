Software developer VALVE had a couple of major announcements earlier this week; the first of which was that there is going to be a sequel to the critically acclaimed Portal released later this year, and the second was that the company's game distribution service Steam, as well as many of its games, will soon be coming to Macs. While the latter may only make a small sect of gamers happy, the former should put a smile on the face of anyone that has escaped the Aperture test facility in the past. To honor these big announcements this week's Auctioneer is all about VALVE, and the games that they've brought us.
