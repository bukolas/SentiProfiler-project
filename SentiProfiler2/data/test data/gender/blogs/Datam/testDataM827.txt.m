Blizzard is one of the few companies that has consistently offered Mac versions alongside its PC releases. While a beta is ostensibly a chance to stress-test the servers, and thus it makes sense to concentrate on the platform with a larger audience, some Mac users have felt a bit put out by the long wait. The beta is expected to end in late spring, making the two month gap for a Mac release a pretty substantial chunk of available time. Still, Blizzard is committed to making it happen, when most developers don't bother with the platform. As the old saying goes, better late than never.
