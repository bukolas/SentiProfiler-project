Down a secret road, where the public isn't allowed... ...a grove of orange trees grows. The trees are about a hundred years old, I figure. Big, fluffy trees with branches that droop to the ground, where little purple wildflowers reach up to kiss the oranges. The trees are precious and well cared for. They grow in the part of the Huntington Library and Gardens that most people don't see. The Huntington property is about 250 acres but 100 or so of those acres are closed to visitors. Last week, on a cool, overcast day, I got to wander those quiet acres because I know a person in high places: a docent we'll call the Altadena Hiker . More to come. Zen Monday is the day you experience the photo and give us your thoughts rather than me telling you what I think the photo's about. There's no right or wrong. It means what you think it means, or what you want it to mean. I look for a photo worth contemplating or, failing that, something odd or silly. And unless I absolutely must say something I stay out of the comments box to avoid influencing the intellectual path of the discussion, because when I get in there everything goes downhill. As I post each new Zen Monday photo I add a label to last week's to identify it if necessary. I'm one of those creatures who needs sun. So is Boz. Like the kitty in this photo, every morning Boz positions himself in a sunny spot by the window and soaks up the rays. Our rainy season affects him so badly that on gray days he gets downright depressed. You've never seen such misery in a spoiled pet. Today is one of my favorite days of the year because we set our clocks forward one hour . Now we can finally get a few extra rays of sunlight each day. Daylight Saving Time was invented by a New Zealand entomologist named George Vernon Hudson . He wanted more daylight hours after work at his day job for collecting bugs. (The things you learn on Wikipedia!) Fine with me. What I can't figure out is why we have to set our clocks back in the fall. It's Saturday. I thought we should have something festive! This was one place I thought would survive the recession. We all want more for our dollar these days. But I never shopped there so I don't know what kind of value they offered, if any. I've noticed lately the parking lot's full, so someone's at least getting use out of that. When I peeked in the windows I saw an expanse of tile and reflections. But when I stood close to the building to photograph the colorful meters, the blinds moved. It's fun time for the San Gabriel Valley blog community. This means not just bloggers, but blog visitors, too--whether you comment or not. Just because you're reading this right now, you're invited to the SGV Blogger's Potluck on March 20th! Wasn't that easy? It's a chance to meet your blog friends face-to-face. It's hosted by some of your favorite Altadena bloggers. Last year it was a blast (not like the picture, though). Come! There's one catch. You have to bring something to share. You know, like, food. It's a potluck. Today's photo is a relatively nondescript parking lot at the corner of Walnut and Marengo. I keep taking pictures of it and not liking them (gee, I wonder why). I finally just played with it and was satisfied. After all, today's post is about playing. Sometimes you've just gotta. UPDATE: Look what Thal sent: according to his comment today, this was the Beaux Arts style Wilson School, formerly at this location. "After the 1933 Long Beach earthquake," says Thal, "many such buildings were demolished as unsafe. Then this corner remained vacant for a long time, owned by the city, and then when the LA County Court needed a parking lot, this ugliness was built." Meaning the parking lot which, even with my most playful alterations, doesn't hold a candle to the Wilson School. Today the City Daily Photo blogs pay tribute to our founder, Eric Tenin. It's a good day for such a celebration because today is the 5th Anniversary of Eric's hugely popular blog, Paris Daily Photo . To date, Eric and his blog have inspired 1178 City Daily Photo blogs around the world, including this one. Quoting from the instructions for today's theme day: "Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, all CDPBloggers are invited to post a tribute shot from their own city using The Tenin Technique of placing the camera on the ground to make an image, or of skewing/tilting the composition, or in some way imitating a specific photo Eric has posted or a common subject matter of Eric's photos...Have fun with it, make it your own and help celebrate a great guy who has spread a lot of friendship and inspiration around the globe since his first post in 2005." I'm a big fan of Paris Daily photo and of Eric, who really does "spread friendship and inspiration" with his photos and blog. He loves the low angle, likes to tilt the camera, occasionally gets a lot of feet in the picture and, due to French law, blurs the recognizable faces. I can't bring you the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower! (Paris Daily Photo joke), but I can give you a few feet! And a little low angle tilting is the least I can do for a guy who, whether he means to or not, has done so much for so many. How do you post a photo a day, every day, for five years? Maybe some of today's participants will find out. Click here to view thumbnails for participants in today's theme. Not, like, as in "woof." Although it's high time for another Boz post. This is a close-up of a tree (what kind?) shedding its bark in Washington Park. I've downloaded a bunch of photography apps on the iPhone but I never use them. I'm sure I will sooner or later, but I'm not into messing with photos too much. I like the act of capturing the thing I see. I think "capture" is a good word for it because I see something interesting and I want to take it with me. The photo is a method of doing that inside of the law. The colors in this bark were intense, but I think the camera gave it some oomph. Okay so it wasn't a church. It was a mortuary. I thought I'd show you a few more pictures from the building at Holly St. and Marengo Ave. that we talked about on Monday. Behind these gates is the courtyard section of Eden Garden Bar &amp; Grill , formerly Holly St. Bar &amp; Grill. (I had to mess with the picture a little.) The restaurant has indoor seating as well. Here's a doorway off another courtyard. Nice way to enter your office each morning. Just steps away from City Hall!
