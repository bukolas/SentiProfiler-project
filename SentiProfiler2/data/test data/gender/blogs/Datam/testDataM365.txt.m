I'm not sure whether I'm doing this right or not as I've never blogged before, but I'm in search of information regarding swallowing and blockage. My wife and I are caregivers of my father-in-law who is in later stages of Parkinsons. He was recently diagonosed with severe blockage of the throat as he chokes on everything he eats. His only enjoyment in life has been eating and he refused the recommended feeding tube. Is anyone are of any type of surgery in lieu of the feeding tube?
