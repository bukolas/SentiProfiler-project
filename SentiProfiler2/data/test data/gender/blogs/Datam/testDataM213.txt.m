At the “Bigg Digg Shindigg” event at the South by Southwest Interactive Conference (SXSWi), Digg CEO Jay Adelson revealed that the popular social bookmarking site is getting a major overhaul, teasing the audience about new features such as personalized feeds and the return of the Digg (Digg) leaderboard.

The new version of the website is not yet available. However, if you visit New.Digg.com, you can sign up for the alpha and see a preview of what the new Digg will look like in the background. Mr. Adelson told the crowd that the site was “five years in the making.”

While the company didn’t reveal much about the new website, it seems that there will be a cleaner interface, more personalization options, the ability to submit news items with one click, and brings back the leaderboard for top users.

Digg’s famous website buttons are also getting revamped. In fact, if you Digg an article on Mashable (Mashable), you will see the new buttons in action, as we are currently helping test them.

We’re going to try to put up a video of the announcement, along with more details on the new version of Digg as soon as we can. In the meantime, I’ve put up screenshots from New.Digg.com and enhanced the brightness to make viewing the new interface easier.

Update: Digg’s Steve French left some more interesting information in the Digg comment thread for this post. Here it is in its entirety:

    “Top to bottom, the entire company has been in overdrive for this project. There are amazing things coming, and I’m glad the screen shots and presentation didn’t spill everything we have in the works for you guys.

    My favorite new feature… it’s *blazing* fast. There has been a lot of effort that’s gone into the architecture and monitoring of performance.”
