We celebrated St. Patty's Day with Ethan, Carys, and Molly and.....a dinner made 'o green!  We had green pancakes with shamrock-shaped whip cream on top, green vanilla yogurt (green food coloring and I were special friends today) topped with green sprinkles, and honey dew.  For dessert, we had a magically delicious treat I referred to as Pots o' Gold - halved orange peels filled with "gold" (yellow jello squares) and garnished with gold coins (chocolate Easter candy)!  As for beverages, we had Sprite in clear cups with green Sprite ice cubes to color our drinks.  It really was so much fun to get into the spirit of St. Patty's Day.
