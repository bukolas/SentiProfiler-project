Why I am not ME..!! (n U r NOT urSELF)
......one of my friends asked me yesterday, if i have ever noticed that people try to make everyone around them like themselves...

......well,yeah. I have. I haven't noticed this.. but i have observed that it is in nature of everyone to make others like themselves.Everyone naturally behaves in a manner which attracts others to their way of thinking.

......but there is a little complication because people show different level of stubbornness in holding on to their own thoughts.Ultimately not everyone can turn everyone around them like themselves.There are surely going to be few losers and few winners in this battle of wits.Here we are going to talk about the ones who get influenced rather than influencing.

Some people are very easily influenced by others.It is very easy to convince them for anything.Such people either badly lack in self confidence or they do not think at all and derive any conclusion themselves.The latter is a very don't care sort of attitude which results from the over protectiveness received by the person in their former life.This makes them devoid of self dependence though they have enough confidence and capabilities.The former kind wants to establish his own way of thinking and conclusion,but he so easily gets captivated by others confidence that he never dares to challenge it.He readily agrees to things in very short time and ignores his original thoughts.. stepping down one more step from his intellectuality.

......comparing both these natures, we feel that they are really too contrasting, and yes, they are.
Where one has a highly centered and self destructive attitude who don't cares about anything at all in life, other one don't even understands the term attitude and value of self.He cares too much about everyone and everything happening around him...
Where one is always happy and cool even in situation of serious consideration, other is hardly happy in life and is always worried in every situation.

.....Now, here is a point.How come these two entirely opposite natures of human life suffer from same problem? okay.. so here i have the answer for you which is as universal as sun and moon... earth and water... clouds n air.. "Nature is dual faced and the extremes often get mixed up.. At the end of journey.. u ll find yourself standing at the same place u started.So this is what u get after changing yourself too much.Same again..."
I positively hope that u ll be able to gulp that little amount of philosophy.Anyway coming to our point a little more directly this time,we often find people or things with very opposite nature in same pit. Most probably,this is because both of them are wrong.We know well that both, a little too less or a little too much are dangerous.One should always try to avoid the extremes.

Well.. if you are still looking for a common reason,there is one,indeed.All the people who have this tendency of becoming like others and follow someone, severely lack in "self belief ". Self belief is again a very simple thing of complicated nature.But it is the most important element in anybodies character which defines the whole face of his life. 

P.S. "hope you are not confused between self confidence and self belief. They are different... allot.

bottom line : realise the importance of SELF BELIEF in life... dont get carried away by others thoughts and beliefs...
