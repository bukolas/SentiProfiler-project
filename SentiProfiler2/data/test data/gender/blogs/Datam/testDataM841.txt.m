The most striking thing about Cozumel right now is the hurricane damage, and seeing what's been repaired and what hasn't. Cozumel is actually on a small island just off the coast of Mexico, and bore the brunt of last season's storms. At first, much of the island looked like old photos of post-war Europe, with only the skeletal remains of buildings standing. We found, as we got closer, that there was a great deal of construction going on trying to refurbish these large buildings (you'll need to click them to full-size).
