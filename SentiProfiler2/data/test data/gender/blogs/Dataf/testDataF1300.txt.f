Great track workout! 3/4 mile slow jog, a bunch of drills (high knees, lunges, killer long jump things, etc.) Then we did a mile on the track, sprinting on the straight parts &amp; walking on the curves. Invigorating! Then a 1/4 mile cool down jog. Then one of the other girls and I did a mile jog--really nice way to wrap up an early morning workout! (Kind of stinks that w/the time change, the whole 5:45-6:45 workout was in the dark.) It still AMAZES me that, at the end of the workout, I can do a mile slow jog and talk the whole way through. I mean, my heart rate is still going up, and my lungs get a workout, but it's pretty easy. That's just crazy. And awesome. Total was 3 miles plus the drills. We were out there about an hour. 3.27 miles, 36 minutes, 11:00 pace. Okay, it wasn't a good pace, but boy was it a GREAT run. I focused on going slow, and was able to think more about lengthening my stride. I added a little speed at the end, but if I hadn't done that, I felt like I could have run for at least 10 more minutes. Maybe my easiest run ever. But still a good workout. I'm liking this slow jogging thing. :) Wow! Not the greatest energy today, but a great run! This is the furthest I've ever run, but just a bit (both time & distance.) I'm pleased that I focused on conserving my energy but was still a little faster than Thursday (even though speed isn't the goal right now.) Next week when I add 4 more minutes to my run I should be up over 3.5 miles. :) 3.39 miles, 36 minutes, 10:37/mile 3.03 miles in 33 minutes (10:52 per mile.) For my 10K training I'm focusing on SLOWING my pace so that I can run a bit longer each week and build up my endurance! This felt like a great, fairly easy pace for me. I was able to speed up just a bit in the last half mile, and I sprinted for the last 45 seconds. Knowing I had that extra energy at the end, I know I could have gone further. 6.2 miles seems a lot more attainable when I'm not pushing my speed! The trainer doing our Tuesday track sessions gave me advice on how to train for my April 4 10K. Here's the plan: Week 1 (this week): Track training 33 minute run 2-36 minute runs Week 2: Track training 36 minute run 2-40 minute runs Week 3: Track training 40 minute run 2-44 minute runs Week 4: Track training 44 minute run 2-48 to 49 minute runs So the idea is to increase my distance by 10% per week, and to run the whole way, no matter how slow I need to go. That way I've got the endurance to run most and maybe even all of the 10K. Running the whole way would be amazing but I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. That would be about 20 minutes longer than my longest training run. We'll see how much energy, motivation, and adrenaline I have on race day! Right now I think a reasonable goal for the 10K is 68:12 or less. That's an average of 11 minutes or less per mile. As I get closer, I'll reevaluate to determine if that still seems like a good goal or not. I'm starting weekly group track workouts with a trainer to help my running. Today we did a slow warm-up jog (3/4 mile), then did a timed mile. One mile time was 8:58! Personal best! I am thrilled to have run a mile in under 9 minutes! This was my first official 5K! My pace was just a smidge slower than last time I ran in my neighborhood. I think with the excitement I got off on my breathing, and I did a little bit of walking near the end because of some side cramps and just being winded. But it went great, and I can't wait to beat this time next time I do a race! Out of 181 women, I was #91, which puts me precisely in the middle of the pack. I'm pretty happy with that, with under 4 1/2 months of running under my belt Honestly, I was hoping to have my personal best time/pace, but it was still a really great experience. More interval training! Used one of Skip Orem's GetFitPod podcasts again. Man, it's HARD! My "sprints" are not very fast at the end! But I know it'll help my speed in the long run, and I enjoy the challenge. I heartily recommend these podcasts. Woo hoo--cut 48 seconds of my previous best 5K time!! Wow, that's getting very close to my 10 minute per mile goal! Tomorrow I'll do some interval training, then Sunday is my first official 5K. Hoping the adrenaline gets me down to my goal! 3.13 miles in 31:33, 10:04/mile
