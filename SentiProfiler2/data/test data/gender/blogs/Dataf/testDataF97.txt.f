It is unfortunate that I have no time to take care of them right now.
But I know that soon, I will have time, and I will eventually rare and love one again!
Especially when I move and have my own place! :)
I've been dinging and donging over what kind of dog I want.
I've previously owned a huge and beautiful Golden Retriever, and although he was the bestest dog anyone could ever have, I think now I want to own a smaller sized dog.
I've contemplated miniature poodles. Even miniature schnauzers!
From the pretty to the ugliest! Like pugs or bulldogs :)
The last Sunday, I went out to dinner with my family and I walked past a pet store as I was walking to the bank to get some moolah. I slowed down to see what was inside because the whole place was full and the sounds of baby dogs yelping was too adorable to ignore!
Okay,
So I was walking, right? And my eyes locked on to the most adorablest, most cutestestest, most incredible looking puppy in the world! It was curled up in a sleeping position, but it's little iddy biddy eyes were open, just observing everyone cooing over the other puppies at the place.
I could not, for the life of me, take my eyes off that puppy!!!!
It was just SO CUTE!
SO!
I think I've decided (I say "think" because, admittedly, I've decided on what kind of dog I want before)!
I want.......
