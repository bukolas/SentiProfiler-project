I am a vicious drinker, but a gentile drunk. I have more stress than people realize, with the potential to let just about anything roll off my back. Gross things that normal people would barf over don't bother me, but I can't stand a messy house. I’m randomly on time, but I always show up. Being stuck in boring conversation makes me want a revolver stuck to my head, but I love carousing threw crowds to find new topics. I have acute paranoia, but am very trusting. I'm bigger better stronger faster, yet streamlined refined downtown and on the ground. my nose is too big, but fits my face well. My eyes are brown, my hair black, and skin hairy and pale. I’m irish, german, and native american, that I know of. my temper is very big while my fuse is miles long. i have entirely too much time on my hands, but not enough money to make it count. I like breakfast in the evening, and dinner in the morning. my thought processes often hinder me, due to the fact that I think way too much. I hold those close to me dear in my heart, but purposefully fail to love those undeserving of my affection. I'm your worst nightmare, your best friend, public enemy, and hero of the day. violence tends to grab me, and loss of freedom sickens me. Some might say I'm philosopher, while others would claim I’m a moron. I value intelligence, while spitting on stupidity. You’ll know everything you need to know about me in 30 mins., then I will proceed to surprise you the rest of your life. 

I'm the best there is at what I do.
