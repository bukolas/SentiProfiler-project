Once a software engineer, now a full time mom having fun with my two year old:)I believe in making young children learn through play. Just like we sneak veggies in the food, you sneak something on to the head while playing:)So, this blog is a collection of all the activities me and my son do together. Thanks for stopping by and if you do try some of these with your kids, let me know:)
