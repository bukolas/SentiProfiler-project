My first testimonial ever scripted does deserve my best friend Edal Varma... Hai Edal this is nt to show u hw much our friendship n love means but to show the world that Allah has blessed me with a everlasting frienship in my life.....Masha Allah Edal u are someone great.someone peculiar indeed. Edal doesnt mingle much with people but those who deserve her friendship are gifted .She is soft humble n gt the least libran character.She is my JUTTDOSTH n im able to predict her at all situations.She gt her own way but im sure her path is always right.Her mom adds to her character n dedicates all her life to her only dayghter. EDAL a slim sleek beauty with an enchanting look almost resembles Deepika Padukone in her shape(LOL!) n the man waiting to hold her hands is more fortunate.Beauty is nt just the outer looks but also the inner heart that adds charm to it Edal sets an example for it.Edal u are really fantastic
