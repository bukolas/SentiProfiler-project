We’re all people who wish to express ourselves and that shines through our words. Have you ever noticed that you use a limited set of words in your life.

India is one crazy nation churning out engineers mindlessly. Parents throw their kids into IIT/PMPD coaching centres in 7th grade. Why, it starts with Abacus classes in 1st grade these days.

And besides, if we could lap up Miss.Kaavya Vishwanath’s stolen tale simply because A.She’s an ABCD and B.She’s from Harvard, I don’t see a reason not to love Chetan Bhagat. My personal favorite.

Which, is the reality today.
