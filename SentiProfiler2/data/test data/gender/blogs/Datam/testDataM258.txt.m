The British Airways strike has dragged up from our collective memory recollections of dismal days of endless walkouts, go-slows, blackings, picket lines and tea and sandwiches at No 10. Back in the 1960s and 1970s the unions were throttling our factories, public transport, schools, hospitals, power stations and even our cemeteries. These days, along with British Airways, we’ve got the threat of rail strikes over Easter and the prospect of 200,000 civil servants walking out on Wednesday to celebrate Mr Darling’s Budget.

I thought we’d swept away all that nonsense with Margaret Thatcher’s trades union reforms. These were drawn up to protect workers from being intimidated into strikes and to prevent unfair industrial action by threatening the unions with fines. When drafting them, I drew on my own experience as a trades union activist and on the knowledge that, while much of the industrial disruption which had brought down both the Heath and Callaghan governments was politically motivated, not every strike is an act of mindless aggression. Not all strikers are greedy, lazy, strike-happy shop-floor workers, nor were all strikes plotted by the cloth-capped colonels of the TUC in pursuit of a coup d’état.  There are moments when reasonable workers clash with short-sighted, arrogant, incompetent or frightened managements and, in despair, they simply walk off the job. It is important that ministers understand that fact. I certainly did, because in my time I had been both a striker and a blackleg.

There is an element of obduracy to the BA strike, and it runs the risk of becoming a suicide pact between the airline and its cabin staff. If this were to be the case, then I am sure that the unemployment and losses invoked would be regarded by the apparatchiks of Unite as “a price well worth paying” in its bid to rule the political and industrial roost.

However, the real danger from the resurgence of industrial mayhem will not become clear until after the general election. Whether Cameron outloses Brown, or Brown outloses Cameron (for neither is likely to postively win the support of the electorate, although I suppose the wife of one or the other could), whichever of the two men finds himself in No 10 will have no choice but to tackle the massive public debts incurred over the past 13 years of Government waste.
