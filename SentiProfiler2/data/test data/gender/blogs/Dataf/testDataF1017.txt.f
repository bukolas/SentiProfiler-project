Since getting another pair was outta question next was to do some quick fix.. I did not seem stickable so we decided to pin it up with something. Babloo got some board pins and tried to pin it, punch it ,stand on it and what not! In vain! It was 6 27 and missing this bus meant I had to roam slipper-less in office till 8! Chuck it! He lost hope! He had only one piece of advice for me. Think you are walking to sabarimala and run! Wat else cud I do? I threw the blackies into the bin and raaan! I was feeling the office carpet with my bare feet for the first time.. the A/c cold stairs and the marble lobby tooâ€¦ I was soo embarrassed I could hardly walk. The bus stand was a good distance away and I had to walk all the way bare foot! To top it all, it was raining! I was praying no one would notice and ask me. Thankfully no one I knew came in the way of my run! My boot cut jeans was serving its full purpose today! It was doing the job of hiding my bare feet! Spotted the bus! I ran inside and it started.
