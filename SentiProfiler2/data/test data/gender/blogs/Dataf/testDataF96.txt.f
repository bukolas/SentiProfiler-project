I write about an hour a day and recently broke into six-figure-a-year earnings. This money comes from running advertising on my websites and blogs, all content sites based on nothing more than articles I’ve written. This is largely passive income that comes in whether I work or not (I choose to work so I can continue to grow my earnings).I got started back in early 2004 when, while going to college, I began having trouble with repetitive stress injuries (a bit like carpal tunnel syndrome, except it was my hands that were troubling me instead of my wrists). I started working with voice recognition software, but I realized that it was going to be hard to get a real job working 40+ hours a week at a keyboard. Everything from driving to mousing to opening jars hurt my hands, so I couldn’t imagine what I could do for a living.And… truth be told, I wasn’t that keen on getting a “real job.” I’d done four years as an enlisted soldier in the army and experienced firsthand what it’s like to be a powerless peon at the whims of superior officers, many of whom are only “superior” because they’ve been in the military longer. To this day, I have a great appreciation for those who enlist in the military and serve our country, but it just wasn’t for me. And I had a feeling corporate America wasn’t going to be for me either. I’d always enjoyed writing and when I started my four-year degree, I had a vague notion of becoming a freelance writer (though, as a diehard introvert, the idea of interfacing with clients and touting my own horn to get contracts made me cringe), but the RSI issue threw a wrench in my plans.I started scouring the Internet for ideas on how I could make money from home. I tried eBay for a while, selling beef jerky of all things (the “Oh Boy! Oberto” plant and factory outlets were in my town), but I quickly learned that competing with others who were into price gouging was difficult and hardly worth it for a dollar or two of profit.Eventually I found my way to various webmaster forums where people were talking about a relatively new (at the time) program: Google Adsense. All over the world, people with little hobby websites were making great money. And interestingly enough, the sites that were text-based–writing!–were doing the best.That was perfect! The only problem? I didn’t have any websites…But, you can’t let the little things keep you down, right?Using Dragon Naturally Speaking (voice recognition software) to navigate the web, I set out to learn everything I could about creating websites, writing content, driving traffic, and optimizing ads. I also delved into the world of affiliate marketing, but I wasn’t much for hardcore selling, so I tended to stick with growing sites I could monetize with Adsense, Chitika, text links, and various other forms of advertising.That first month I made a whopping $2.00.Well, not really, since you have to make at least $100 to get a payout from Adsense.
