About five years ago I was referred to Dr Richard Reschke for some lower back issues I was having.  He is a naprapathist, which I believe means that he studied the muscular system.  In any case, he is a miracle worker.  He seemed to know exactly how all the muscles interact with each other and how to massage and manipulate them to give me relief and help me develop preventative stretches and exercises.  I absolutely swear by Dr Reschke.
