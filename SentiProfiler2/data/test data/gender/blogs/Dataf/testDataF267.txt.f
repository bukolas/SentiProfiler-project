Today's menu: chili, beans, tortilla chips, icee, milk So...the chili was actually quite good and I ate the beans and chips too. I couldn't bring myself to eat the icee, but I did force myself to try it. The sweetness was overpowering. I winced. I don't have a clue how much high fructose corn syrup was in it, but I couldn't stomach more than a drop or two. I talked to two of my students about what they ate at lunch. They told me they ate the icees (evidence: red stains around lips and on shirt), the chips, and the milk. The rest they threw away. Can you imagine the spike in blood sugar? I don't think that students should be offered "icees" at school. Since it's coming from the school, why would they suspect that it might be bad for them? About 30-45 minutes after lunch one of the students I interviewed seemed to "crash" physically (some tears about a minor offense from a classmate). This same student seemed pretty spaced out. What are we doing to kids?
