Is uncle "SAM"behind "TERRORISM"????  -  It is my debut in blogs and i was thinking to do it long time ago but cannot.Now I have started it ,then I thought on what thing should I start. To tell u when I was thinking about this,in front of me the times of india home page was open and some clip of respected Manmohan Singhji and Mr. Ahmad Raja Gilani was open in which they were talking to each other in NAM summit.straightaway I thought that I will write on most important and dreadful and horrifying problem we are facing (I guess more than Global Warming) and that is TERRORISM.

It has been blamed that Pakistan or other countries in central Asia have initiated Terrorism but is that true ???I do not think so...These countries are all the scapegoats..then who is the master???yes absolutely correct ..it is uncle SAM.I am just not not crapping here ,I am telling u the truth.Pakistani author Ahmad Rashid in his book states that in 1986 when Soviet Union was in war with western countries especially U.S. then the inititation of organised militancy was done.

In this book it has been stated that in 1986 U.S.'s Central Intelligence Agency(CIA), Britain's M16 and Pakistan's InterServices Agency(ISI) planned to launch mujahideen attacks in Soviet Union and most of the funding was sponsored by uncle SAM.Now the question is that why are they afraid of aftermaths of the things they have done ???you have to be brave enough to face the things you have done .Now the twin tower attacks triggered their adrenaline and they started attacking here and there creating more terrorists then stopping them.There had been excessive killing in these in 8 years andits not acceptable and its just not only about stopping terrorism.its also about playing the oil game and winning it too.really hats off to uncle SAM and I am also still suspicious that was twin tower attack really act of Terrorism or it was game played by the clever mind of uncle SAM.You never know because when they create moon on earth then it can also be done.

These things have to be thought about and or the solutions have to be sorted out otherwise towers were in their own country then it can happen to any other.I am not blaming only one country but we should be ready for stopping it....
