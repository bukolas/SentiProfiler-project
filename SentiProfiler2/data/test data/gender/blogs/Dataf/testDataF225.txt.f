Just try to mess with Jessica Simpson.

After the ribbing she has taken in the past year, chances are you won't get very far.

She has been called fat, lonely, you name it — yet she's about to open herself up to the public again, despite what criticism it may invite.

"Right now I'm so numb to it I wouldn't take offense," says Simpson, who takes viewers on a journey of personal discovery through her VH1 show, The Price of Beauty (premieres tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT). "I've allowed my life to be public, and that is my responsibility. I can't expect people to not have opinions on how you live your life."

Simpson, 29, who launched a singing career as a teen and rose to fame through her hit MTV reality show Newlyweds, has been a tabloid fixture — one that has only escalated since her divorce from Nick Lachey in 2006.

In the past year, Simpson has come under scrutiny for her love life, including a high-profile breakup with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, and she has been criticized about her weight and appearance .

"At the time I just didn't talk about it at all. I just didn't want to give it any attention," Simpson says. "I thought the best way to do it was to discover beauty by myself. I think the world kind of gave me this favor. I don't think I would have been as receptive to the idea of this show until now."

In Beauty, Simpson sets out with longtime friends Cacee Cobb and Ken Paves— who doubles as her hairstylist — and travels around the world ("And I wear really great shoes," she jokes) to learn about the lengths women will go to to feel beautiful. A trip to Thailand examined women who wanted to lighten their skin color, and a visit to Uganda explored a tribal ritual of pre-wedding weight gain. "Can you imagine?" Simpson says. "It's amazing. Men want their women to be fat because their prized possession is their cow."

Simpson says the timing for the show was just right. "I did hear the concept (for the show), and at the time I was really struggling and I was like, 'Is this (my weight) ever going to stop selling magazines? Why is my weight such an issue, especially when it's probably five pounds?' "

"It's so trying, because daily women are obsessed with the way that they look and what they see when they look in the mirror," Simpson says. "A majority of women who would have gone through what I went through this year ... being a public embarrassment, I don't think they could have handled it. I was on tour (with Rascal Flatts), and I had to get up on stage every night and just know that people were looking to see whether I was fat or not. You walk by 10 magazine covers and it's you and these stupid jeans."
