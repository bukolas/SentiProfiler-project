Yesterday, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 sang the national anthem at The New York Rangers game in Madison Square Garden ! The kids brought the crowd to an incredible roar of thunderous applause, as can be seen in the video below! What an afternoon!! The usher outside our suite where we watched the game said in his 20 years working at MSG, he would place our rendition of the anthem in the Top 5 versions that he's heard! And Greg , our contact from the Rangers camp, e-mailed and said, "Believe me â€“ I work every home game and tonight was the loudest applause I have ever heard at the Garden for an anthem. I truly hope we can make this an annual tradition. To top it off, you guys brought us luck during a team slump, as the Rangers got a big win!" AWESOME!! After their incredible performance of the anthem, all the kids were ushered to 3 VIP suites, where they got to watch the game! While there, they were visited by former Rangers, Gilles Villemure & Pete Stemkowski , who signed autographs and spoke with the kids! Not only that, we ran into America's Next Top Model contestant, April Wilkner , who now works for MSG as a TV correspondent. She was as cool as can be, and a great sport, letting Ethan get in some more celebrity sniffing! During a TV break during the second period of the game, they showed the video filmed by our new friend Faith that we filmed at school the other day of " Empire State Of Mind ," which was spliced with highlights from the season! It was so great hearing the kids and seeing them on the jumbo-tron! The kids all got hot dogs, chips, soda, balloons, and programs courtesy of the Rangers! Thanks to the team, Greg, & Faith, for all their incredible hospitality and for a day the PS22 Chorus will not soon forget! And thanks to Ms. Lisa, Mrs. Johnson, Ms. Laurie, & Ms. Massimo , for capturing the day for us with all the great pics and video footage!! This week, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 is on fire! Starting it off with a viral smash of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix , the kids have brought in a whole new bunch of fans from not only the States, but from countries like France, Brazil, Germany,and more! The chorus earned 2 Top 10 YouTube honors for the week and a whole slew of others, while making its homepage the #7 Most Viewed Music Channel this week! (That places it even higher than Beyonce's channel which currently weighs in at #13! Craziness!!) Also this week, the chorus was invited to perform and make its plea for the arts at the District 31 IDEAL parent forum, which you can see in the video at the top of the post. We thank long-time friend of the chorus, Joan McKeever Thomas (see pic below), for this wonderful opportunity to invest in the future of our chorus children's arts education. The kids did us proud as always, and we hope that in sharing both their talent and their story, we made an impact. So how can PS22 top a week like this? Well get ready, because we're going to give it the ol' elementary school try! Indeed there's lots more excitement on the way! On Sunday afternoon, the kids will be appearing at Madison Square Garden , where they will be singing the national anthem at the New York Rangers game! Earlier this week, we got a visit from Greg &amp; Faith representing the team, who shot footage of the kids singing their version of " Empire State of Mind Pt. XXII " that will be played at the game alongside highlights of the season. Unfortunately, that video will not be able to be broadcast, but the MSG Network is supposed to be airing the kids' singing of the anthem, though it may be later on in the game during an intermission. Exciting stuff!! Puck drop is at 3:00 PM EST so set those TIVOS &amp; DVRs! Then on Tuesday, prepare for yet another brilliant PS22 Chorus collaboration! The kids will be joining reggae artist Matisyahu on stage at the 92nd Street Y in N.Y.C.!! They'll be performing their version of Matisyahu's "One Day" with the man himself! You may recall "One Day" was the official song of this year's Winter Olympics, and a great song it is! According to our sources, the show is nearly sold out, and the show will be airing live to 17 different cities in Hillels and JCCs across the country. PS22 will also be hosting a visit from Matis to rehearse (a la our unforgettable Celtic Woman collaboration ), so this should prove to be yet another rewarding week for our blog followers!

I found it very touching when she sang it for me, and decided to work with her to arrange it for the full chorus. Here is the beautiful result. Congratulations to Fiona for her superb song and performance here in the video. Already internet fans are comparing her to a young Avril Lavigne ! Love it!! We're so proud of you, Fiona!! What a great example you are to show how to turn painful emotions into something beautiful. UPDATE (3-13-10): CONGRATS TO FIONA!! She earned a YouTube Honor with her original song as the #68 Top Rated Music Video today!! Check out the screencap below! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 made the cover of CHORAL DIRECTOR MAGAZINE ! The magazine includes a very in-depth article/interview with writer Eliahu Sussman , and features some excellent photos from Claudio Papapietro . Unfortunately the on-line version doesn't include all the great photos of the kids that were used in the hard copy version, but the complete article is available on Choral Director Magazine's website . (The magazine was apparently published back in November, but it just came to my attention the other day!) Awesome to discover that PS22 Chorus of 2010 is currently being featured on the home page of Billboard.com on as their featured viral video! Below is a screen cap of their home page, and a cap to the link to the vid and short article praising the kids' new version of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix ! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 is definitely causing quite a stir around the internet with its newest cover of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix . In addition to earning over 50,000 views on its weekend debut and being featured in top spots on Buzzfeed & Reddit , today the video has shown up on three noteworthy blogs from The Village Voice, Teen Vogue, & MTV Buzzworthy ! All have great things to say about the chorus's latest effort! Check out the screencaps below. And for more on "Lisztomania," click here . The chorus just got another e-mailed message from Lynn Hillary of Celtic Woman , who visited the kids just last week . Dear Gregg and PS22, It's been almost a week since we met you and your incredible bunch of little superstars but we are all STILL talking about it all the time! I can't stress enough what an impression they made on us not just with their glorious voices and obvious love and dedication for the music they sing, but they were just such nice friendly kids!! I just know they will all go on to do great things in the world. Sometimes I forget what joy there is to be found in singing, and you all reminded me of that! Also your advice to the kids about "if you FEEL the music you can never go wrong!" is something I will always think about if I ever feel nervous! I've been reading your amazing blog and really wanted to add my thanks too (you don't have to post this up, I'm sure you're running out of space! I just wanted to thank you again, I know it's all been said already but once more wouldn't hurt!!) I was on the meet and greet that night at Radio City and the people were amazed when I told them this was our first time performing with the children, they said it looked so natural, like it was really meant to be a part of the show all the time. If only you could be with us every night! Performing You Raise Me Up now feels strange without PS22, like there is something missing, but their voices always resonate inside my head as we sing, so in a way it feels like they are there all around us, sometimes I imagine that they are! I think this is an experience that will stay with me for a long long time. Thank you so much and please tell them that we really miss them and think about them a lot! I wish you and the children continued success and happiness, and we really hope to see you again soon (for more hugs..and sniffs!) I can't wait to see what you get up to next on your adventures...we'll be watching!! Peace and Love, Lynn
