I'd just like to say that I've really enjoyed reading the comments. Thank you. I love reading your personal stories about school lunches. I also see a lot of opinions about the photos and about food options in your children's schools. And every commenter who tells me to keep going is also appreciated. The best part of the comments is that we are opening a dialogue about school lunches in our country. *** And I've done another email interview. This time with mother nature network : An interview with school lunch blogger Mrs. Q Thanks Robin! *** I think when we look at under-performing schools and we want to change those numbers, we need to question everything. Teachers' skills, abilities, and training are often addressed in the media as a big part of the picture. You know, I attend quality professional development activities through my district every 1-2 months depending on the schedule. That's pretty darn good if you ask me. I always learn something new. But nowhere have I ever seen anyone think about what we offer children for lunch. Let's think about what we give students to ingest. For instance, I personally enjoy eating hot dogs maybe every 4-6 months, mostly in the summer cooked on a grill. Also I eat them when I go to the ballpark as a special treat. But I wonder if we should give a child a hot dog lunch and then ask them to take the ISAT (state test)... *** In 2004 Jamie Oliver launched an effort to improve school lunches in the UK. He started a program called School Dinners and he wrote a manifesto about what he wanted to see happen in the school lunch movement (I love the word "manifesto"). Not all schools accepted his new program, but many did. In 2006-7, the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at Essex University comes along and decides to study 11-year-old kids who ate the new diet of fresh food for at least 12 months. Results: An independent study shows the performance of 11-year-old pupils eating Oliver's meals improved by up to 8% in science and as much as 6% in English, while absenteeism due to ill-health fell by 15%. The researchers controlled for other variables and compared the results to the schools where the kids did not have access to the fresh food. WOW. That's all I can say.
