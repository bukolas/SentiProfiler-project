Okay, please stop laughing. There have been cases of upstarts beating well-established rivals. Before Microsoft Word came along, many of us were using WordPerfect and WordStar. Before Google came along, we used AltaVista and Yahoo. Before Internet Explorer came along, we used Netscape, and now we're watching IE lose ground to Firefox. Trust me, crazy things happen in the technology space. So, it wouldn't be unthinkable for the Zune to give the iPod touch a run for your money.
