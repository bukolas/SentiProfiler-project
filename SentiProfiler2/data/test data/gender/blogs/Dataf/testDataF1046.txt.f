I recently discovered that I just love to eat. No I am not fat. But I am just loving food now more than I ever did in my life. I don’t know why. Is it because I am totally relaxed with my life that I can finally focus on the food I eat ? Hmm…no not really. My life is not what I would describe as “relaxed” at any level. But still…I am loving food. For instance, there was this simple curd rice, with Ruchi’s mixed vegetable pickle, and mango for lunch and it took a lot of effort to keep me from licking the plate! It’s the combination of the sourness of the curd and the “hot”ness of the pickle with the sweetness of the mango I guess. I’m still dreaming about it. Oh that pineapple rasam rice with ground-nut thovayal and potato chips. Ahh…What a heavely combination. My stomach felt soo happy after it. Today for lunch there was this special cauliflower manchurian that was made for my little niece. I secretly stole a piece and it was just fabulous. The mild aroma of ginger and the sweet-hot sauce with that delectable chinese-food fragrance. Faanntaasstic.  I can go on an don…the bisibelabath that I had for lunch, with a side of sepankelangu fry, the spinach masiyal yesterday, the simple dal and ghee…. I guess I better watch my weight.
