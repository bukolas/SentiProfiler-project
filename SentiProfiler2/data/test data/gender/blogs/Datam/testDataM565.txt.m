SV, the most famous name in our campus. Right from the office assistant to the H.O.D. Everyone knows him and most of the time,he can be seen hanging out wit gals.lolz.
An enthusiast of taking seminars, even the staffs wldnt have taken so much. To say, he needs to be paid for his service lolzzz and he also asks Qs after his seminar(remba over).
Any doubts the whole class, goes behind him. Takes classes at his home for class guys. 
Now, my project mate. Its really cool discussing topics with him. Very cooperative and he helps a lot, A LOT!!
You cant see him sit quite . He'll keep himself occupied with something or the other.
