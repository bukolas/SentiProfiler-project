Super Mario Bros (the original Nintendo version) was the first game I can remember playing to the point of ridiculousness, and is an instant classic.  Super Mario Bros. 3 was my absolute favorite game for that console.  Alas, I didnt' get a super nintendo, so here we are over 10 years later to teh New Super Mario Bros. game for the Nintendo Wii.  WHAT A GAME!  The 4-player co-op can get confusing and messy, but that's what the Wii system is all about: managing multiple players and making video games an interactive experience
