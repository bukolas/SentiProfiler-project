We had our meeting at school on Friday to discuss some ideas that I could use at home to encourage communication. I did get some good ideas. One of them is having a picture of each person in the family and showing Adrian the pictures and telling him for example, “Go say ‘Hi’ to Nevaeh” and Adrian is supposed to go over to Nevaeh and say “Hi Nevaeh”….he’s doing this at school. It’s harder to accomplish at home, I think I need to bribe him with Skittles like his teacher does at school! LOL We WILL get the hang of this! He’s doing it great at school so I know he’s capable.
