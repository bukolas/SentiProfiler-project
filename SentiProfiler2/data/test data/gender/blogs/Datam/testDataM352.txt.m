To all my friends, I'm sorry. I think about this blog often, but can never find the time to write on it. I have 3 of the 4 kids sleeping. My 23 month old was taken to the hospital to get play dough taken out of his ear. Yup, the reason I have time to write is because my goofy son wanted to see what having play dough in his ear was like. My wife just called and it's out. They'll be home in 5 minutes. All is well at casa de la insano. PS. Robin is expecting again. This will be number 5............................god help us;) Time to get neutered I guess.
