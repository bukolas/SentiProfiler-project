"Designing a graphic is like writing a story. You can't include all your material, nor can you present it with uniform emphasis. To engage readers, you have to selectively edit and then order your information into a narrative. In other words, what is most important for people to see and in what order? Not every reader will agree with our choices. Our health care graphic from the January issue (left, click to enlarge) has provoked a healthy debate around the blogosphere. Some people love it; others loathe it. The issue isn't just premiums or public options. Many bloggers are talking about our process.
There's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution. It just emphasizes different points—a different story. Here's why I didn't go this route. 1) Many people have difficulty reading scatter plots. When we produce graphics for our magazine, we consider a wide audience, many of whose members are not versed in visualization techniques. For most people, it's considerably easier to understand an upward or downward line than relative spatial positioning.
2) This graphic was designed for our vertical printed page (top). Scatter plots tend to work better as horizontals. Without this context, I can see why online viewers would question the graphic's shape. 3) Any data visualization is going to put certain information in the foreground and other info in the background. The scatter plot nicely organizes the countries into three clusters, but the varying dot size puts too much emphasis on the doctor-visit data, which should be a tertiary point. On the other hand, our parallel plot (which I anchored around the spending and life-expectancy averages) calls the reader's attention to discrepancies between spending and life expectancy—the story I wanted to tell. I applaud people for questioning our approach; in fact, I love this kind of dialogue—especially about art and design. Whether we reach consensus, well ... that's a different story. At least one blogger said we should have used a graph known as a scatter plot. A scatter plot lets you visualize the relationship between multiple variables. In the case of the health care graphic, our variables are spending, life expectancy, and doctor visits. The scatter-plot version (below) plots spending along the x axis and life expectancy along the y, and it uses dot size to show the doctor visits.There's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution.
