Something amazing happened yesterday.  I knew at the beginning of the week that I was nearing the end of my novel, the one I have been writing on and off for the past two years.  The one in which I have fictionalised my own paranormal experiences, seeing them through Camilla's eyes.  I have lived her life, thought her thoughts, created her from my own imagination.  I have felt as if I owned her, as if she answered only to me.  I have visualised actors playing the parts of characters, Martin Shaw as the Reverand Oakley, Robson Green as Michael all verging on a complete fantasy of which I have seen played out before my eyes. But yesterday I realised that I had reached the light which marked the end of my work in progress.  I had said everything that needed to be said, got to the point where stretching out the novel for the sake of length would have been wrong and most likely spoilt the whole effect.  And so I closed the file and finished it.  I haven't typed the words, "The End" because I am sure there will be much to add, and too much to subtract.  I have put my little memory sticks on which the book is saved, into a drawer and locked it.
