I wrote this one in 30 minutes last night. Isn't it nice when the right guy gives you the right sort of inspiration? I was tempted to use his name, but alas, I thought I'd leave a little mystery this time around... I like the way you look me in the eyes I, I like the way you always make me smile And oh, you know I love the way that, if only for awhile, you make me feel like the only girl in the room Guess I never saw myself until I saw you It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open We have a lifetime of tomorrows But don't you always want to remember the taste of yesterdays? What if I told you our yesterdays were happening right now? If you fall, I'll be the one to catch you If you call, I'll be the first to rescue you Who says we can't jump with our feet still on the ground? It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open And as the days turn into years I'll still be the one here to catch you Baby, know that I'll never forget you... It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open It's our world, not theirs, baby It's our time to live our lives unafraid While the sun shines down on us Don't you know you and me, we can be anyone? Right here, right now, there's so much beauty in knowing It's your hand that's going to hold me So, baby, let's just let go Into the great wide open Baby, know that I'll never forget you... [Photo via Le Love ] TO: Men all over the planet FROM: Melissa RE: Stupid stereotypes DATE: March 16, 2010 So, boys, you know how I'm always trying to drill those stupid disability misconeptions out of your beautiful minds? Well, stand-up comedian Ryan Niemiller has actually found a better way to do it. His A Guide to Dating for the Handicapped takes the humor route, and I couldn't have said it better myself... As someone with a handicap, I have had my fair share of troubles finding love. Luckily, all of my non-handicapped friends have been so kind over the years to help me along the way, and tell me how I, someone with a handicap, should date. I've compiled, in conjunction with Ally "Wheels" Bruener, this helpful list for anyone else here that might have a disability! I present... the Guide to Dating for the Handicapped! -Only look for others [people with disabilities]. -Never try to date up. You will fail. -Make yourself look as normal as possible. If someone is stupid enough, they may think you're normal. -Never complain about the fact that you don't have anybody. You're handicapped and supposed to be an inspiration. Don't be selfish. -Everyone that hangs out with you is paid to do so. Just accept it. -Don't ask for anyone to set you up. No one is going to be that mean to their friends. -If you are disabled, you must be asexual. -If you really want a date, try getting it setup through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It's your best bet. -Just accept the fact that a pat on the head from a little old man will be the most action you'll see. -Take some classes on counseling: You'll be the one everyone comes to with their problems. -If anyone actually offers to sleep with you, decline. It is a fraternity/sorority initiation prank. Or your parents paid them. -If you don't want to die a virgin, begin shopping around for the best-priced hooker immediately. -Never let your quest for a relationship get out to your family: They'll reassure that it just isn't practical. -Your non-handicapped friends are right - you're just being silly. -Society isn't as harsh as you think. You're just being overly critical. -Every member of the opposite sex you talk to will tell you there is someone out there for you - it's just not them. -You just aren't trying hard enough. -You're trying too hard. Just let it happen. -You want a family? Don't these supposed rules society buys into just look completely ridiculous and ignorant when seen on paper (well, on the screen) and listed all together? Don't they want to make you scratch your eyes out? Because you know I have a big mouth, allow me to add a couple of my own to round out the list... -Always have your date talk for you, cut your meat for you and tell people to move out of the way as you're coming through. Because, you know, you can't use your voice in public. Don't want to scare the little children, do you? -If the most action you ever get is looking into the gorgeous blue eyes of Silvio every time he comes to help you shower, be grateful. Silvio is your in-home health-care worker. -You're loved by your family. That's more than what some people have. Don't cry with a loaf of bread under your arm. Let me know, boys, when those guilty, oh-my-gosh-I-can't-believe-I-let-her-get-away feelings set in. Go ahead, boys. I'll wait. Heck, I've got all day - and night...you know, because it's not like I have a date or anything. xoxo [Photos via happythings ] I love the meaning behind these travel-themed engagement photo shoots. These couples look so happy and excited to be starting a new adventure in marriage, don't they? xoxo P.S. The Map Shoot is my favorite! Too bad there's not really a Map of Love somewhere out there! And the Plane Shoot makes me want to burst into my own rendition of Up Where We Belong . Sigh. P.P.S. Check out Beau-Coup's Wedding Blog for more awww-inspiring couples! The wonderfully insightful Kasey is back to share more tales with us this week (read his previous tales here + here ). And just so you know readers, these are in no way solicited by me, but I will say I'm loving his style, aren't you? xoxo Rule #11 Put your money where your mouth is. Guys, if you like a girl, you need either to pay or offer to pay for the evening. Period. Ladies, if you like a guy and you’ve been on a few dates, (and you’re not going to dump him), offer to pay every now and then. I typically refuse to let girls pay if I like them. But I love it when they ask. And if the ladies want to pay for their own, that is fine too. If a guy does not offer to pay, it is usually safe to assume that he isn’t that into you. If a girl wants to pay her own way, guys, let her. Actually, guys, let her do whatever she wants. Don’t screw it up. But AT LEAST OFFER to pay. You are not trying to buy your date, or buy sex, or any of those ludicrous ideas. You are simply saying, “I like you,” and proving it by how you handle your money. Rule #22 Always call with a plan. Recently, a girl friend of mine received a call (from a guy who supposedly likes her) where his only question was, “Can I call you tomorrow to see when you’re free?” Let this sink in. Read it again.... Exactly. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. He had her on the phone already...wouldn’t it make sense to just ask her when she was free? Yes. People are actually this silly. Anyway, the point is, always call with a plan. Even if the plan is just to talk about the other person’s day. That counts, because you’re talking, building communication skills, and (hopefully) getting to know more about the other person’s likes and dislikes (so you can pull out that information when it really counts). Guys, unless it is too late to go do something, you always need to have a plan that puts the two of you together. Suggestions include movies, dinner, walks in the park, heck, you can even walk around Wal-mart and do some grocery shopping! I like asking girls if they would like to play with my Wii. Oddly enough, they like it!!! :) It is OK if the girl wants to change the plan. Just make sure you have thought of something. Especially avoid this exchange: “What do you want to do?” “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” “I don’t know...maybe...well....what do you want to do?” NO, NO, NO! If all else fails, say, “I want to see you!!” That, at least, is the truth. [Photos via We Heart It ] Prologue : You know your nonexistent love life has become close to extinction territory when your own mother makes you feel as though it's the most ludicrioous idea in the world that you could possibly be interested in or even have a chance with a romantic beau. I had another one of those invisibility moments last week. You know the kind, friends...where you're just standing there and wishing you had a white flag that you could wave wildly in the air and scream, " HELLO, I'm right here, aren't I? Why can't you see me? And yet, even though I was there, I felt completely invisible. And what made me feel even worse was that the person whom I felt invisible toward wasn't some guy or some guy's girlfriend or even Mr. Hefner himself. It was my mother. Here's how the situation went down: I got a sweet email from Cute Guy Friend on the anniversary of my dad's death last week. He wrote to say that he was thinking of my family and remembering my dad. How sweet is that? Well, as my awkward (and awful...) luck would have it, things turned pretty sour, pretty quickly when I casually brought it up to my mother later that day. "Oh, that's sweet," she replied, and then immediately turned to my sister and said, "You should date him..." My sister? Really? I mean...really? I just sat there floored, and quite a bit deflated. A few minutes later, during which time my mother had probably forgotten what she'd said in the first place, I said flat-out, "Why didn't you say that to me?" "You've never expressed an interest in him," she replied, as if my question was the dumbest thing she'd ever heard. NEWSFLASH: Neither has my sister. She's never expressed an interest in him. Not even once. So let's review the facts, shall we, friends? -He emailed me -My sister hardly knows him I suppose it bothered me even more because this isn't the first time my mother has bypassed me completely, which is why I've always looked at my sister as the pretty one. I know, it's being overly sensitive probably on my part, and my mother probably wasn't even thinking about my disability when she made that remark. In the last few months, I've been feeling increasingly confident as a sexy woman with a disability ( OK, gosh, just typing the word sexy to describe myself just made me blush, literally... ), and I suppose this harmless comment brought some of those invisibility, wallflower feelings back. Even if just a little bit, you know? Is it impossible for my mother - or anyone, really - to think that I could be capable of being in a relationship? Has that concept just never even dawned on her? Am I not worthy of that just as much as anyone else? I know she doesn't do it consciously, but sometimes, I swear my mother is incapable of seeing me as a woman, and yes, I'm aware that this is a common theme among mothers. But it just seems so much more pronounced in my life, especially when you add the disability factor to it. Or maybe, at the end of the day, I'm just being overly sensitive. Maybe I'm projecting my own insecurities and using them as a lens by which to judge things. Let's be honest, friends: It's not like I haven't done that sort of thing before. But you know what, damnit? It bothered me. It hurt me. It eroded just a little of the disability self-esteem that had been slowly growing like a flower. Well, now the flower looks as if it's beginning to wilt. What do you think, friends? Am I just being overly neurotic once again? xoxo [Photos via happythings ] Routines...my gosh, they can be hard to get back into, can't they, friends? I'm back at work today and am trying to get back into the swing of things. May these calming photos inspire me - and you! xoxo [Photos via flickr ] Happy Monday, friends! I was going over the Man Candy archives over the weekend, and I had to gasp when I realized I haven't featured this guy yet. Well, he's more of a man than a guy, and let's just say that he's only gotten better with age. He showed us a new life of living on a prayer and always promised to lay us down in a bed of roses. And as she's aged, he's up the sexy-wow factor by declaring "it's my life" and reminding us that, yes, we can go home again... JON BON JOVI!!!!!!!!!! Happy Friday, friends! How was your week? My spring break was entirely too short (as always!), but I'm looking forward to returning to work on Monday and get back into some semblance of a routine.
