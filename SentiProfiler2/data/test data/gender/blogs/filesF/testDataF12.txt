I am currently over in Estonia, speaking at a conference in Tallinn about media and marketing innovation. The lovely Hando Sinisalu from Best Marketing has been filling me in on the state of affairs over here.

Estonia has been incredibly hard hit by the recession, with an 80% reduction in advertising in print since its peak in 2008. He told me that very few advertisers are spending any money at all - the only category that is seems to be Telecoms, where there is fierce competition.

Between 2000 and 2007, Estonia was one of the fastest growing countries in the region, with year-on-year growth in consumption averaging around 9.5%.

The economy shrank by a massive 14.1% last year, so times are very tough, but the hope of joining the Euro next year is keeping people optimistic.

My presentation was about the learnings we have from the Festival of Media and the Festival of Media Awards, including lots of examples of media innovation, new technologies and branded utility.
For those of you who loved the Valentino Spring 2010 ready-to-wear line – with it’s organic coral-shaped lace embellishments – when it first appeared on the   However,  on the retail pricing issue, these hit a more negative note.

So, are these retailing for $1000, $2000, or even $3000?

Nay, I say.

These babies will run you a cool $4700 – plus shipping.

Ouch.

Are these pretty?

Yes.

Unique?

Certainly.

Are they nearly 5K worth of all that?

Not in this shoeblogger’s humble opinion.

What do you think?runway last year, you are in luck. Luckily for Jenn, this shoe was tickling my memory.   It is definitely similar to styles that we saw being produced by many designers last spring; blending cage and gladiator sandal styles with a zip-front and high heel.  After a little bit more investigation to jog my memory, these are eerily similar to the (now out of stock)  Christian Louboutin ‘Zipette’ that was available for sale last spring and the prior fall (2008-2009).  That double platform has been favored by Christian Louboutin for several seasons now. Unfortunately, these are past-season shoes which will make purchasing an original Louboutin style a challenge and test of personal patience (which can pay off, if time is not an issue for you).

On a positive note, there are several designers producing similar, zip-front, caged gladiator sandals for the upcoming spring 2010 season.

The original Louboutin Zipette has long since sold out of luxury retailers such as Saks and Neiman Marcus. So, now it’s up to Jenn. Does she wants to pursue a Louboutin aftermarket shoe-quest? Or would she prefer a to look at similar, but not identical, offerings that are currently available from several other brands?

I have rounded up several alternatives if she is looking for a style to wear this spring, since a Louboutin quest can take months or years. We hope that his helps Jenn out in her quest for her perfect high-heeled cage gladiator. Last month I had a short telephone call with Courtney and Philip Mason, the owners of a young art-to-wear brand named ‘Studio Jellyfish’.  Call it  a mini-interview, if you wish.

And, despite the writer’s block that has been for some reason confounding me on this article (this is at least the 3rd draft I have worked on thus far), I am determined to finish this today.  Luckily, the hand-painted artwork of these shoes and handbags is striking enough to speak for itself, so I’ve decided to start with a few images to ‘get the conversation going’. These painted ladies all have their own personality – and names.   Names like ‘Golden Goddess’, ‘Blueberry Girl’ and ‘Bubblegum Girl’.  You won’t find any generic style numbers here.

Of course, with every pair carefully embellished by hand, would you expect anything else?  

Per Courtney, each ‘girl’ has been designed prior to appearing on a shoe or accessory, and is then free-handed onto the fashion canvas using a paint pen medium. The handmade nature of the creative process makes each pair of shoes subtly unique.

When asked if she had a favorite, Courtney answered without a bit of hesitation, “Bubblegum Girl, and some new ones that are in the works.” (Bubblegum Girl is on the second row at the left.)

According to Philip, one of their goals is to bring fine art into everyday accessible fashion. “all day, every day”.  And it looks like they have a growing consumer fan base that agrees.  In fact, in the just over 4 months that they have been operating their various websites (online shopfront & etsy.com), they have had orders ranging from the United States to Ireland, London, and Saudi Arabia.  They also have plans in the works to expand into more mainstream fashion which will include denim and shirts and will continue to feature their signature ‘girls’.

So, who are their favorite designers or other influences?  Ferragamo was immediately mentioned for classic appeal and style. When I mentioned how much their visual style reminded me of the bold simplicity of Patrick Nagel’s works – but with a hint of Gwen Stefani’s Harajuku Girls, Philip agreed, saying, “You pretty much nailed it on the head.”  He also noted in a separate comment that “We have twelve years working as graphic designers. We love what we do. We wanted to do something for ourselves and it seemed like a natural transition to move that onto shoes and fashion.”

Oh, and about the name; why Studio Jellyfish?

(Politely interrupting each other)

“That goes back to when we first met. We both loved, still love the ocean.  There was this South Beach hotel with a jellyfish tank in the lobby. It reflects our love of the sea and has a lot of our past and memories in it.”

So, writers block defeated.  Plus, there’s even a small positive to come from it;  Studio Jellyfish is now holding a spring sale which ends on March 30th.
I can't get the stories of Haiti out of my mind.

A patient showed up at the Port au Prince hospital ward with a massive left sided paralysis, an obvious stroke. This 48 year old woman had collapsed the day before and was now accompanied by her three grown daughters, who were most attentive and worried. I examined her in the bed with other patients and families gathered around. (There is no sense of privacy and even an exam seems to be everyone's business in Haiti). One daughter spoke broken English but I had a good translator that helped me get the information I needed.

It was a sad story. They had been on the 5th floor when the Earthquake hit. They fell straight down and dad was killed. One of the children had a crush injury to his leg and the entire remaining family was now "on the street". Just surviving must have been such a strain. Then...mom has a massive stroke.

As I was examining the patient further, one daughter handed me a quickly scrawled note. It read. "I have a problem She have a AIDS" In this private way, the daughter wanted me to know her mom had AIDS.

In a country with such poverty, lack of health care and lack of education, it is not a surprise that HIV and AIDS remains a significant problem and Haiti is the Caribbean island most affected by AIDS. There also remains a stigma and HIV infection is a big secret. Once I asked my Haitian interpreter to ask an emaciated patient if he was HIV positive and the interpreter couldn't even ask the question. It is just not done. It was a real act of bravery for that daughter to pass me the secret note.
Why am I banging on about EGGS all of a sudden on a Saturday night (oops...actually it's 4am in the morning in Hong Kong here...)?  Well, because I've had a bit of an EGG-citing whirlwind trip to Hong Kong where the first part of the trip was already mind bogglingly EGG-citing but the second part also matched that EGG-citing ness in equal measure.  So that's a lot of eggs...

But I promise there is a reason why EGGS are present in the post and hah, it is by no means round about and forced.  Ok maybe it is... oh well, here goes... Joyce aka the store which opened my eyes a little to Hong Kong's forward fashion acceptance last time I was there organised an even more eye-opening event to honour a special one-off project that Rodarte has taken part in.  The Mulleavy sisters have created four one-off outfits inspired by four characters played by Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love, Hero, The Heroic Trio, Clean) that were on exhibition at a bash thrown last night which accompanied a premiere of a short film directed by Wing Shya (most known for his graphic design and photography work on many Wong Kar Wai films...).  Rodarte.  In Hong Kong.  With Maggie Cheung.  Plenty of Wong Kar Wai connections/connotations.  Whats.NOT.to.like. I'm getting to the eggs, I promise.  I pretty much landed into Hong Kong feeling like a zombie but had to get stuck right into the proceedings of this event.  First up, a cocktail preceding dinner at renowned dining experience Yin Yang (weirdly enough, I tried to book a meal here last time I was in HK...).  In a group of about 18 peeps... there was Maggie Cheung bounding up to people introducing herself gaily and pretty much exuding friendliness and elegance.  Feeling small doesn't even quite cut it.  It is one of those cliches that everyone of Chinese origin (or maybe even non-Chinese origins...) universally hearts Maggie Cheung and she has 'national treasure' written all over (Judi Dench, you doth protest too much about the term...!) and frankly I'm not going to exempt myself.  She IS someone both my grandmother, my mother and me can get down with and after meeting her and err....  not creepily watching her at dinner... no, not at all.... I can go back home with happy reports.  The my mother will yelp with jealousy.
Good news for U.S. territories; Del. Donna M. Christensen (D-Virgin Islands) announced Thursday  she and fellow territorial delegates were successful in including the territories in the health care reform bill released by the House leadership.

 “After numerous meetings over the past two weeks with members and senior staff and with the leadership in the House, Senate and with President Obama, the territories are in the bill,” Christensen said.

While Christensen is pleased with the current proposal she said the bill was not perfect but will play a “significant role in improving the health care of the American men, women and children living in the U.S. territories.”

“Not only will the U.S. Virgin Islands receive an enormous infusion of new Medicaid dollars, but we also have access to the health insurance exchange.”

 Christensen released a statement thanking, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Chairman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.),  House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and her colleagues in the Congressional Tri-Caucus, which includes Latino and Asia members of Congress. 

“This whole process confirms that when ordinary people come together around common ground, extraordinary things can happen, Christensen declared.
I keep wanting to use the word webinar, but I can't decide if it is too jargony. This  lexical conundrum reminds me of when the word workout went mainstream. It sounded too jargony  to me, and I used to say go-to-the-gym and a not-so-snappy stand-in.

Should I use the word webinar?

Should I tell you how many times Ryan Paugh told me that I have to announce the webinar if I want people to come to it? I kept not announcing anything because I didn't know what to call it.

Whatever we are calling it, it will happen on this Friday, 1pm est. (Sign up here.) I know that people in Australia cannot listen at this time slot. You have told me before, and I'm listening. One day I will do a webinar at midnight. One day I will record webinars so it won't matter so much what time slot they happen in. One day there will be world peace.

On Friday we will talk about finding fulfillment, which is actually like establishing world peace, just doing it one person at a time. In an act of full disclosure, I'm going to tell you that knowing what to do is not the hard part of finding fulfillment. Doing it is the hard part. It's like breaking up with a terrible boyfriend when the sex is really good. Not that I have ever had this problem. I have found that part of what makes a terrible boyfriend is terrible sex. But whatever. I can imagine the problem. The problem is that you  know what to do and you don't do it.

Wait. Actually, that's the problem with everything. Like, I knew I was going to have to write a post about the webinar where I don't know if I should use the word webinar. I knew it wasn't going to change if I waited so long to write the post that Ryan Paugh wants to kill me. But I waited anyway. Why do we not take the action that we know is the right action? I will not be covering this problem in the webinar.
An 11-year-old girl -- a precocious reader -- was visiting my home a few weekends ago. Over the past year, she'd devoured "The Great Gatsby," "The Joy Luck Club" and "Huckleberry Finn." She noticed the review copy of Picoult's 17th novel, "House Rules," on my coffee table and said that she'd liked some of Picoult's other works, especially "My Sister's Keeper" and "The Tenth Circle." I told her this new novel was wonderful.

Big mistake.

Shyly, she asked if she could borrow it. I'm an educator, someone who, by training and disposition, is inclined to applaud a young person's thirst for reading. But I grabbed that fat review copy out of the kid's paws so fast she didn't have time to blink. The possessive hoarder who wants to keep all good books within reach had been awakened. I muttered something inane about the reviewers' code of honor forbidding me to lend books before they've been published. Hey, if this 11-year-old wunderkind has absorbed anything from her reading, she's surely learned the fundamental lesson of every Jodi Picoult fictional family: Life's tough.

Throughout the long unfolding of "House Rules," Picoult keeps so many storyline streamers whirling in the air that it would be easy just to praise her technical mastery. But though the multiple plots and narrators are, indeed, adroitly managed, what most readers will cherish is the character of Jacob Hunt, an 18-year-old high school student with Asperger's syndrome. (Jacob, in goofy teen fashion, jokes: "Asperger's. I mean, doesn't it sound like a Grade Z cut of meat? Donkey on the barbecue?")

Asperger's rules Jacob's life and the life of his family, which consists of his understandably resentful-but-guilty younger brother, Theo, and his wry and exhausted mom, Emma. (Although Dad sends child support, he fled the coop long ago.) Emma ensures that a sense of routine -- so crucial to Jacob's emotional well-being -- is strictly maintained from week to week. His clothes are color-coded in his closet; daily meals are color-coded too (Monday food is green; Tuesday, red; Wednesday, yellow), and his diet is restricted, since glutens and caseins spark meltdowns. As Emma observes: "Frankly, with 1 in 100 kids in the United States being diagnosed on the [autism] spectrum, I bet I could have a top-rated show on the Food Network: Alimentary Autism. Jacob doesn't share my culinary enthusiasm. He says that I'm what you'd get if you crossed Jenny Craig with Josef Mengele."
On Wednesday night, I was honored to be a guest on CUNY TV's Brian Lehrer Live, a weekly current events show filmed here in New York. I was there, along with Marisa Meltzer, the author of Girl Power: the Nineties Revolution in Music and Rob Walker, who writes the NYT's "Consumed" column and is also the author of Buying In: What We Buy and Who We Are. I was there to talk about the YouTube phenomenon that is the haul video. If you've never seen a haul video, it's basically a person doing on camera what you usually do when you come back from a shopping trip: excitedly show what you've bought to anyone who'll listen. Except in a haul video, you show it in front of your webcam and then post it on YouTube for an audience of thousands. Most haul videos are made by teenage girls, and most of the items been shown off are clothing or makeup, though a thorough browsing of the genre reveals that there are haul videos about a whole range of products, including groceries. It was a really interesting discussion, one that touched on issues of consumerism, teenage belonging and self-identity and on the cultural emphasis placed on women's beauty and the products we're encouraged to buy to achieve it. As you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about haul videos in the last few days, and I think there are a few noteworthy things going on here. First, I think it's important to note that these videos are predominately made by teenage girls, and that the vast majority of the money they're spending is on clothes and on makeup. As I mentioned in the segment, the average American woman will spend over $20,000 on cosmetic products alone between the ages of 13 and 29. And that doesn't include manicures, pedicures, haircuts or colorings - that's just for makeup products.  Once you add in those services and include other services like tanning and waxing, the number goes up over $40,000. Over the course of a lifetime, the average American woman will spend about $500,000 on making herself beautiful. Half a million dollars. That's a studio apartment in New York. It's two full rides to medical school. And while a lot of women never go tanning or get a pedicure, and while products and services obviously cost less depending on where you live, as well as a number of other factors, that's still an enormous percentage of women's collective earnings being spent on making ourselves beautiful. As I said on Wednesday night, I'm in no position to tell anyone how to spend their money, but I think it's important to take a moment and imagine all the other things we could do with that money, and to carefully examine the reasons why we spend it on making ourselves beautiful. I should clarify that I don't think these women are buying these products because I think they're vain or vapid.
Eco fashion has been a profoundly online phenomenon from the get-go.  Slowly but surely, however, boutiques are cropping up all over North America and Europe.  If you’re in Vancouver, you don’t want to miss the chance to check out Body Politic founded by Nicole Ritchie-Oseen in 2008 and located in the South Main district of the city.  Body Politic features some of the hottest green designers including Stewart + Brown, Elroy and Perfectly Imperfect.

Ritchie-Oseen says, “At body politic we began with the belief that sustainable and eco-friendly clothing didn’t mean sacrificing style. The goal was to fuel our absolute love of fashion and distinct style without compromising our environment, our community, or ourselves!”

The space is as green as the fashion, with energy efficient lighting, re-purposed furniture and raw concrete walls as a neutral palette against which the carefully selected clothing and accessories stand out beautifully.

Can’t make it to Vancouver?  No worries!  Body Politic also sells online at www.bodypolitic.ca.  You can also keep up with the official Body Politic Blog, follow them on Facebook, and on Twitter.

Supporting eco fashion designers and retailers is one of the best ways we can put our money where our ethics is.  Drop by in person or online and give Body Politic a looksee… The earthquake that shook Haiti happened weeks ago, but the needs of the Haitians are greater now than ever.  Doctors, supplies, and provisions must continue to be sent to assist families that are still suffering from the effects of losing everything–including loved ones.

To answer the call, the independently owned jewelry company Love Heals has created four special pieces of which they will donate 100% of the profits to Doctors Without Borders.  If you’ve never heard of Love Heals, check out their website and touching story:
Hi. I am Kim Moldofsky from Morton Grove, Illinois. Agliophobia is a fear of pain; iatrophobia is a fear of doctors, but I have yet to find a word that defines my biggest fear—a fear of pre-existing conditions. My fear of pre-existing conditions began years ago when I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that causes dry eye and dry mouth. My illness seemed more of nuisance than a health crisis, so I was shocked when after my husband’s employer went bankrupt and we lost our medical coverage, I was repeatedly told that I was uninsurable due to this condition. That was back in 2001, when I was 33 years old.

Eventually, my husband found a job with benefits. After a period of time, my faulty immune system was covered in full, which was helpful because by then I had developed rheumatoid arthritis. Still, once it was diagnosed, and I found the right combination of medicines to combat my symptoms, life continued at a normal pace. We were happy to have medical insurance, but we didn’t have a great policy. We had a $5,000 deductible for our family, and with two young children under foot, we often met that deductible. At one point, I realized our high cost, high deductible actually penalized us for using the plan. For example, using the mail-order pharmacy aligned with our plan, it cost me over $2,000 a year for certain medication, a certain arthritis drug. On my doctor’s recommendation, I checked the prices at the local Costco. It turned out that the same drug cost me less than $300 without my insurance at Costco.

In the fall of 2008, my husband lost his job and eventually his benefits. This time, I felt fortunate to find a private insurance, a private insurer saving me the expense of the state plan. However, like many policies, it does not provide coverage on the issues that matter most to my family, even my 9-year-old son has a pre-existing condition that is not covered. And of course, my arthritis, well they accepted me into a plan, into the plan with a special deductible for arthritis-related treatment. Knowing that this typically only involves a couple thousand dollars of treatment a year, we felt okay with that. However, it wasn’t until after we had signed on the dotted line, the only dotted line that was available to cover my entire family, that we learned this deductible which I assumed was $5,000 or $10,000 was actually a $65,000 deductible—a $65,000 deductible for the most pressing medical condition in my family.

It is not creaking bones that keep me awake at night—it’s the fear of developing a condition related to my arthritis that could send us tumbling into bankruptcy. Although I have some coverage, I have a fear of unexpected news, odd test results, a new diagnosis. I have a fear of a new pre-existing condition, a phobia without a name. Although we pay several hundred dollars a month for access to quality care, I am afraid to use it. I often ignore minor aches and pains. I have held off on some scheduled blood tests and exam, and I worry that my attempt to save a few dollars now could cost me dearly in the future if minor problems spiral into larger ones, but ironically, as long as people with pre-existing conditions can be denied coverage, spending money on doctor visits and tests to solve problems early on could actually cost more dearly in the future.
So a few weeks(?) ago I got a message from some guy on OkCupid. He seemed smart, funny, cute and familiar. Like we’d met already. I couldn’t place him, though.

So I replied to his message and said, straight out, You seem familiar, is it possible that we’ve met?

A couple of days passed and I didn’t hear back from him, so I figured he placed me from somewhere (maybe we went out years ago, or something) and didn’t want to reply.  In the meantime, I was getting some unwanted attention from a bunch of guys (young, persistent ones who clearly had been hearing wild things about older women) and so I decided to shut down the OkCupid profile and focus on Match and Chemistry.

So then a week or so later I got a message from that same guy on Match.com, asking me where I went to/why I disappeared? I thought it was sweet the way he followed up with me on another site. But he didn’t mention my question about looking familiar.

You know where this is going, don’t you?  I think I’ve figured it out.  After a few messages back and forth, he said something in a message that jogged my memory.  I think he’s this guy.  I’m 95% sure (but not 100%).  It’s embarrassing that I don’t recognize him from his pictures or profile and that he doesn’t recognize me (my profile is almost identical, and while my pictures are new they really do look like me).  But I have to admit, my memory is completely useless lately (I take some medicine that messes it up, and so I write EVERYTHING down).  And I’ve always been bad at recognizing people/faces.

So now what? He’s been aggressively pursuing me, online, for weeks. Do I just stop replying?  Do I tell him that I think we already went out last summer and tell him the details and see if it was him?  Do I just let it ride and go out with him, again, telling him nothing about my suspicions just to see what happens?

Could this possibly be the universe telling me that that bad date was a fluke and me and this guy should meet again?

Today's girl has really evolved in the last couple of years. I honestly didn't recognize her when I was going through the thumbnails!

Yesterday's answer is behind the cut. Were you correct?
It's funny, but I barely remember the first time I visited New York. I was nine years old, and went with my Dad and brother to see the World's Fair in Queens. I remember the It's a Small World Exhibit, but mostly I remember the car ride home on the Jersey Turnpike, gazing out at the brightly lit New York skyline and realizing for the first time that if it's dark outside, you can actually look sideways out the window and not get car sick.  

The next time I visited New York, I was on an eight grade class trip. I think we went to the United Nations, but I don't recall that. Here are the two things I do remember - (1) singing "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"while stuck in traffic coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel onto 42nd Street, which in those days was lined with Peep Shows and Porn Shops and (2) being a smart-ass with my friends and leaving a one-cent tip at the restaurant in Tudor City where we were packed in and served overcooked Salisbury Steak, which was basically inedible. (Even then, I was a food critic..)

The third time I visited New York, I fell in love. It was a day trip I took during college with my best friends. I think we must have seen a play, but for the life of me, I don't remember what it was. This time it was lunch at Mama Leone's, which even I, the rube from Philly, recognized as cattle call for tourists - the place was loud and packed and I felt like a number.  And the portions?  HUGE. Like "I think I'm gonna' be sick", huge.  So we decided to walk it off with a stroll in Central Park. And it was there, sitting under the Wisteria Arbor on the West Drive, that I fell. Hard. 

Maybe it was  the intoxicating floral perfume. Combined with post-prandial carbohydrate overload and a bit of a buzz from the wine we had with lunch. And a warm spring day and best friends. And that skyline. (Clearly, it was not the food...) All I knew was - I was in love. With a city. And I knew - I had to move here.
Acne is the word every teen hates but faces this nightmare at one point or the other during her growing years. There are as many numbers of creams and lotions available as the number of teens with acne! New research suggests that a diet with foods containing low glycemic loads could help people suffering from acne to get rid of their acne.

Scientists from th RMIT university in Melbourne studied the effect of food on about forty three patients aged between 15 and 25 years. They were randomly assigned a normal diet and a low glycemic load diet for 12 weeks. The diet consisted of 25 percent energy from protein and 45 percent from low-glycemic-index carbohydrates.

It was found that people whose diet consisted of low-glycemic-index carbohydrates had a significant reduction in the total acne when compared to people on a normal diet.

What is Glycemic index?

The Glycemic Index (GI) relates to the way your body’s sugar levels respond to certain foods. Foods are given a rating from 0 -100 on the glycemic index with glucose in the highest position. High Glycemic Index foods (such as simple carbohydrates) will increase the body’s sugar levels rapidly whereas low glycemic index foods will increase the body’s sugar levels slowly according to HWF.

The new findings suggest that diets that contain low glycemic loads may not only improve insulin sensitivity and helps reduce weight but clears up acne as well.

So, if you want to get rid of acne and have a blemish free skin, foods that have high glycemic index like white bread, sugar, potatoes are a strict NO. However you can eat low-glycemic foods like whole grains, vegetables, fish and lean meat as these foods are kinder to your skin and say good bye to acne forever
Marisa Meltzer is the author of Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music and the co-author of How Sassy Changed My Life: A Love Letter to the Greatest Teen Magazine of All Time. She is a contributor at Slate and the Daily Beast, where she reviews books and movies, and writes about gender in popular culture.

Girl Power, which Courtney posted about a few months ago, is about the evolution of the feminist message in music during the era when Meltzer was coming of age. In the process of writing her book, Meltzer, who was a fan of Kathleen Hanna and Sleater-Kinney as a teen, travelled around the country attending music festivals, revisited the records of her youth, and even got a chance to meet and interview some of the women who made those records. But she also confesses that in order to write Girl Power, she had to watch the Spice Girls movie. Meltzer seems to have pretty much the coolest job in the world - Spice Girls movie aside.

Feministing readers who love music, movies and Sarah Haskins should check out Meltzer's archive of writing for the Daily Beast. Feministing readers who secretly love the Bring It On franchise should wait until no one's around to see their browser tabs and then go read Meltzer's analysis of the series.

And now, without further ado, the Feministing Five, with Marisa Meltzer.
Public=Online is the the rallying cry during this year’s Sunshine Week, an annual event to highlight the importance of open government and the freedom of information. The week is sponsored by the American Society of News Editors, and many editorial boards have echoed the thoughts of the Cleveland Plain Dealer:

    “...government information ought to be made available to the public as quickly as possible, with a minimum of rigmarole and in the easiest, most accessible way possible--which these days means via the Internet.”

We agree--and what better way to celebrate Sunshine Week than with leading thinkers on government, media and citizen engagement on all sides of the political spectrum who feel the same? Yesterday at our Google D.C. office, the Sunlight Foundation announced its Public=Online campaign.

It’s exciting to see growing support for transparency and to see the progress that’s been made in the last year alone. Every day, through sites like Data.gov and projects like Open Congress, OMB Watch and our Public Data Explorer, more data is available online.

But there’s still a gap between having access to government data and easily understanding what it means. To help fill this gap, Google has partnered with the Sunlight Foundation in its Design for America contest to make government data more comprehensible to the public. You can learn more and get started on the contest homepage. There’s room for all kinds of folks to participate, and we can’t think of a more fun way to keep the spirit of Sunshine Week going.
Students excavate a kiln at Cheung Ek, Cambodia. Photo courtesy of Phon Kaseka Cheung Ek is infamous for being the site of a Khmer Rouge killing field—some 20,000 Cambodians were murdered here between 1975 and 1979. Yet Cheung Ek also has a much older history, and today a team of archaeologists led by Phon Kaseka of the Royal Academy of Cambodia is investigating what lies beneath this once horrifying landscape. The team has found that Cheung Ek was settled around 300 B.C. and played an important part in the emergence of Southeast Asia’s first great economy, the mysterious Indian-influenced civilization known as Funan. Centered in the lower Mekong floodplain, Funan flourished from about the first to the sixth century and eventually gave rise to the well-known kingdom of Angkor, which culminated in the 13th century. According to Kyle Latinis of the University of Cambodia, “Cheung Ek may be one of the pinnacles” in a complex of sites. Both Roman and Chinese historical texts record trade voyages to Funan, and archaeologists have uncovered artifacts from Rome, Persia, India, and Greece at the Funan port town of Oc Eo, now located in southern Vietnam. Archaeologists also have investigated another important Funan site, Angkor Borei, in southern Cambodia. Kaseka’s team is just beginning to investigate Cheung Ek, but it has already discovered 61 pottery kilns strung out over a distance of three miles (five kilometers). The kilns have been carbon-dated to between the fifth and seventh centuries, making them the oldest uncovered so far in this part of Southeast Asia. If the kilns were all used around the same time, that would support the idea that Cheung Ek was a major pottery producer—and therefore critical to Funan’s economy. Local potters likely made several kinds of pots, including spouted vessels called kendi, which were used for storing and pouring water, perhaps in ritual ceremonies. Archaeologists can learn a remarkable amount about ancient technology and trade from studying kilns and the waste that can be recovered from them, such as clay debris and pots broken during manufacture. By examining the chemical composition of the clay debris and then testing kendi pots from the same time period that have been recovered at sites across Southeast Asia, the team hopes to determine the extent of Cheung Ek’s trade network. Like many other Funan-period sites, Cheung Ek may have continued to be occupied after the decline of Funan and well into the era of Angkor. A mysterious large, almost perfectly circular earthwork dates from at least the tenth century, and the team is testing several hypotheses as to its design and purpose. Work has yielded stone inscriptions, architecture, brick temple or shrine foundations, and other features characteristic of later periods. Kaseka’s team is eager to continue excavating the site’s kilns, temples, and houses, but it faces difficulties.  Cambodia is recovering from its violent past under Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, but the recovery process is proving detrimental to the nation’s cultural heritage. Growth has been rapid and often uncontrolled, and the external demand for marketable artifacts has intensified. Urbanization and looting are destroying Cheung Ek's history. “Action needs to be taken now,” says Kaseka. As part of a new generation of Cambodian scholars, Kaseka wants any fieldwork plans to include community education, and he wants to find ways to persuade developers and looters not to destroy the site or any others like it. Sections of Cheung Ek have been preserved as a site museum, a memorial to the horrors of the killing fields. Now efforts are being made to preserve the parts of this site that could reveal so much about Cambodia’s distant past.
New rules took effect February in Delaware governing the arbitration of business disputes in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The rules implement amendments to Delaware law, adopted last year, granting the Chancery Court jurisdiction to arbitrate certain business disputes, and compliment rules already in place governing the Court’s mediation of business and technology disputes.

Under the new law, the Court of Chancery has jurisdiction to arbitrate “business disputes,” which would include most complex corporate and commercial disputes. At least one of the parties must be a business entity, and at least one must be organized under Delaware law or have its principal place of business in Delaware. No party can be a consumer. In a claim exclusively for monetary damages, the amount in controversy must be at least $1 million. All parties must consent to the arbitration.

Arbitration in the Court of Chancery can have numerous advantages over litigation or other forms of arbitration, in that it provides prompt and confidential resolution by an experienced and sophisticated arbitrator. The arbitration will be heard by either a judge or master sitting permanently in the Court of Chancery. The petition and all subsequent arbitration proceedings are confidential, and are not included in the Court’s pubic docketing system (unless there is an appeal). A preliminary conference will be held within 10 days of the filing of a petition, with a final hearing taking place within 90 days of the filing.

Selection of arbitration in the Delaware Chancery Court may be appropriate for many complex commercial ventures and arrangements among U.S. entities, as well as those involving non-U.S. entities, often presenting the most straightforward, predictable and efficient form of dispute resolution, including for buy-sell arrangements, purchase price adjustments, governance disputes in joint ventures, and a wide variety of similar situations. Litigation, in Delaware and elsewhere, will continue to be a feature of disputes involving public company merger and acquisition transactions and governance matters, and planning for stockholder litigation in particular is a crucial part of transactional and governance preparedness. But serious thought should be given to selecting arbitration in the Delaware Chancery Court as a dispute resolution mechanism for other forms of corporate and commercial disputes, both in transactions and more generally.
Its not particularly hard to lose a messaging war against Republicans. I mean, you aren't working against the kind of sophisticated public relations machine typically reserved for say, a Kardashian. You're not even handling a hot potato. If it weren't for the lucky strike of stumbling into a minority by nominating a candidate who, up close, appeared to be melting, Republicans wouldn't even be able to consider their drumbeat of "NO!" much of a message at all. Putting aside the deep irony - Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman both filed amicus briefs when Ralph Nader challenged the Constitutionality of the so-called "Slaughter Rule" - Democratic leaders immediately fell prey to the only response "deem"-ing a bill passed can possibly elicit.

No. Seriously. WTF (followed, as usual, by "Tea Party," but that's another story for another day).

Don't get me wrong. I'd be happy to adopt a "deem" and "pass" approach to almost anything. Louboutains too expensive? I deem them passed into my closet. Parking too tough? I deem and pass my double parking into legitimacy. Deeming and passing a flurry of ideas would not only ensure that the world bows to my dominion, but would, frankly, make Congress more effective. But call me skeptical that an $800+ billion spending bill should be deemed to have passed just like that. Beyond feeling powerless in the whole matter, I feel like I should have the right to know if my Congressman decided, for example, to have his vote purchased with earmark spending or a lobbyist-sponsored "fact-finding" trip to the Caymans.

Not to mention, the current bill happens to be unpopular. Which presents a problem. The real solution would be to go back to the drawing board and draft a bill we can all live with, but that involves work - which people get themselves elected to Congress to avoid - and if they spend more than one more week addressing health care as opposed to, say, dramatic job losses, Congress will see its approval rating sink even lower...perhaps to the level of their Kardashian rivals.

So faced with a decision - significant work or pass an unpopular bill through a back door method that people don't quite understand - Democrats chose the latter.
If I’m being completely honest, I’d have to say that my quest to cut down on my multitasking has really been in vain. I really just don’t think it’s in my nature to only do one thing at a time. I try, but I get bored or I feel guilty that I should be doing more. My addiction to technology doesn’t help either and neither does that the fact that I’m a workaholic. I mix work with play all the time & play with work. Not to mention trying to fit in family friends in between errands and new projects I start.

I came upon this whole goal of reducing multitasking thinking it might cut down on my stress, but I think it’s making me more stressed thinking about all the shit I have to do! Added to the stress factor, I also heard a few reports on NPR about how multitasking can make your brain less effective, but so does a glass of wine and I’m not giving that up!

Oh, why can’t I be happy doing less?  I have these notions of mediating and being more in the moment, but both of those things just seem to yet another thing to add to my to-do list.

What about you? Am I along in this quest or are you all struggling with the idea of trying to lead a simpler less harried life only to be thwarted by yourself? I am on the search for a virtual intern for Summer 2010.

Responsibilities will include:

   1. Conducting research for stories.
   2. Help me coordinate a variety of projects—which will mostly involve contacting artists, scheduling & organizing details.
   3. Respond to email!
   4. Writing assignments…both assigned and those based on your own interests.
   5. Other stuff that comes up.

Workload will be about 8-10 hours a week and there is absolutely no pay, but the glory, oh the glory…

If you are interested, email me at jen@indiefixx.com with a brief note about why you are interested in being my intern and a resume as well. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone who may be interested.

For a student, I’d be happy to write a letter of recommendation after a successful internship. I’d also be happy to promote projects that the intern may be working on personally.

I will collect resumes until May 15th and get back to those who I’d like to interview after that. Please note that this is a virtual internship, so your location does not matter, but you must be super self-motivated.
Nobody knows DIY beauty better than Kayla Fioravanti, Co-founder and Chief Cosmetic Formulator for Essential Wholesale. So if the Visa bill was bigger than you expected or you've just been keeping a keener eye on your pennies, then these tips are just up your alley!

Winter Beauty Tips:
Potatoes have so many uses!  Slice raw potatoes and put them on your eye lids to reduce puffiness.  Or cure swollen feet with a mashed potato foot soak!  Just purchase a box of dehydrated mashed potatoes and followed the recipe. Once you have your mashed potatoes add lukewarm or cool water to get the temperature to the right level to soak your feet.  The potatoes will retain heat longer than a traditional foot bath and they help reduce swelling and soften skin.  To make it special add essential oils before you put your feet in. Then indulge feet into one of the best soaks you’ll ever experience!   (It’s perfect for making use of those leftovers…)  This same concept can be used with Oatmeal.  Oatmeal will be soothing and deeply restorative to dry cracked and painful feet.
 
Exfoliate:  In the winter, the most important thing to do to keep skin remaining healthy is to exfoliate twice per week to remove dead skin cells.  Central heating plays havoc on the sebum our skin normally produces, which makes our skin lose water which should be retained in the lower dermis of the skin.  During the winter months there are thousands of dry skin cells ready to be sloughed off the surface and they become clumped together with oil which forms what appear to be flakes. Don’t be flaky, exfoliate! Exfoliate your facial skin with crème based exfoliates with jojoba beads.  You can exfoliate your body with a butter, oil, or crème scrub that uses salts or sugars.
 
Hydrotherapy:  For a simple in home hydrotherapy, start out your day with a hot steamy shower and just as you are finishing switch the water to cold for about fifteen seconds. Repeat the process for two minutes. This hydrotherapy technique will revitalize your skin by stimulating the flow of blood through the skin.
For the millions of people in Japan who spend too much time at work to have pets, a social life, or a partner, help is at hand.

It started with Tokyo's cat cafés, where customers can sit around and sip coffee—and also rent a cat, for 10 bucks an hour. With Japan's economy in deep recession, cuddles are clearly in demand; customers ranging from schoolgirls to engineers are flocking to businesses such as Neko no Mise ("Cat Store"). Clients receive a "menu" of the felines available for petting; balls of wool and plastic mice are complimentary.

The cat cafés have become so popular that more than 150 businesses have sprung up to offer animals for hire—ferrets, turtles, squirrels, monkeys--on an hourly, weekly, or even monthly basis, if you want to bring the critter home. Dogs are predictably popular, but for those with a smaller apartment and budget, beetles are an option.

One agency has taken the idea of renting whatever makes your life complete a step further. Hagemashi Tai ("I Want to Cheer Up Limited") rents out relatives. Whether it's for a wedding or funeral, you can choose the perfect person to accompany you, rather than go solo. The agency also offers a service to single mothers seeking a male role model for their children. The "father" will attend school events, take the kid to the park, help with homework. Kikue Shimizu, 37, has a weekly arrangement with just such a rent-a-dad. "My two boys are growing up without a father figure in their lives," she says. "I need someone who can talk to them about their education, their futures."

To be sure, the tradition of paying someone to be nice to you has a long history in Japan, dating back to the dawn of the geisha. Consequently, there's no stigma attached to the fact that the so-called cousin at your side is clocking up the yen by the hour.
It's always such an encouragement to see other families dealing with SID. My son (6yrs) was diagnosed with SID with speech/language delay when he was 2. We've been in heavy (and expensive) therapy since then. Before kindergarden, when we were seeing very little improvement from the OT, he was also diagnosed with ADHD. As what I felt was a last resort, we chose to try medication (a patch–Daytrana–that administers meds only when on). I was so concerned about how he would be able to function in a classroom setting. For you doctors and researchers out there, I think this is worth noting: My son's speech was pretty bad. Low understanding of language, and an often flipping of phrases–almost as if every sentence was a word scramble with conjunctions rarely used. Within 3 hours of administering his first patch, my son began talking at lightning speed, AND FULLY CORRECT! It was as if a knotted ball of string that once was his words and thoughts had been pulled straight. IT WAS AMAZING ! And he seemed to know that he was speaking correctly. He talked for about 8 hours straight. For the first time, words were coming out the way he meant them. The medication hasn't been a cure-all, but it has enabled him to focus on his work and sit still at school, follow complex instructions from parents and teachers, and helped him with social interaction. I know that's not what some of you want to hear, but I think research needs to be done on how ADHD meds can benefit SID kids.
Thank you for all who voted in the poll. Eighty-one percent of you believe I should put ads on the blog. I'm going to wait and see. Reasons are: 1) Ads don't jive with the purpose of the blog I've started this "guerilla" undercover lunch project... and then you guys, my readers, get some weird off-beat Goo*gle ads, which most likely will have nothing to do with what I'm doing here. 2) Donations and transparency I love the idea of making a donation to a farm-to-school initiative and I may just do that on my own time. But if I set up ads, how do I do that? with my real name? and SSN#? And then I'm assuming I get the ad check directly, which then I have to deposit and then turn around and donate. Basically, I can't make it go from blog to organization unless I put a donate button. I haven't done enough research into specific organizations and I don't want it to look like I'm endorsing some over others. So now is not the right time. 3) Lack of time I don't have very much time what with working, family life, and running our home. If running ads even adds just 10 minutes per day of extra work, I honestly don't have that time. I'm already going to bed way later than usual because of the project. I just can't do any more than I'm already doing. I can barely find time to read all of your excellent comments! *** I was thinking that if I decide to go with ads, I could donate the ad revenue to my school when/if I get found out. I think I'm going to get "busted" one day and I'm unsure of what ramifications there would be. But if I could off-set the bad press with a little ad revenue for my school, that could be a nice way to smooth things over.
I am a flight att. and waitress and single mom. I work like a dog.I had been hurting for months and then began swelling and having red joints. In April I was diagnosed with RA and the doctor prescribed Humira. I had been taking Voltaren which mad no difference. Anyway, I was worried about the side effect of a lowered immune system. So far, no colds, but I cut my hands at work(paper cuts) and they become angry and swollen, not healing at all. I also experienced complete numbness in both arms and hands the night after my second injection. Has anyone else taken Humira? How is your immunity? My joints and pain are so much better. Only 2 fingers still swollen and red. I have to be able to stand 13-14 hrs about 6 days a week. Please let me know about Humira….Thanks.
It sounds like that is what you have. I have achalasia. I am 26. I had surgery on the 6th of this month. You need to bring up achalasia to your doctors. It is a progressive disease---so yes, unfortunately it has gotten worse with age. They might suggest botox injections since you are a little older than myself but they might also suggest surgery---mine was done through my stomach----opposed to open surgery---I am still recovering but I believe that I will be fine---the only thing is that if you do the surgery do not do the botox treatments---it can cause scar tissue making the surgery more risky than it already is. I had one botox treatment a year ago to alleviate some of the symptoms---but the scar tissue was there and things could have gone very badly. Please heed my advice and call your doctor!
I was planning today to write about how Ricki hasn't stolen borekas for a whole week or so. Progress. (GRIN) Real progress. Don't worry- she didn't. But imagine my happy balloon deflating as I saw Ricki extracting my VERY EXPENSIVE camera from her school bag this afternoon. In the morning I had caught a shot of her frying an egg (I'll post it tomorrowhopefully), although by the time I had fetched the camera, the shot was not as good as what I had wanted to photograph. Then I must have left it in sight, and Ricki simply gave herself permission to make off with it, and took some 50 pictures at school today. I am only happy that the camera came back in one piece….and that she isn't (hopefully) stealing borekas.
Got an email yesterday from a friend, with a link to an article about recent changes over at Google. Seems the search giant has yet again tweaked its search functionality. Such news always alarms me, as I teach Internet search and this usually means extra work. This time, though, the change is a small one. According to CBC News, Google is combining its multiple search offerings (web, images, blogs, etc.) into a single "universal search". The change is only evident at Google.com (not the various international flavours of Google) and pretty superficial, from the user's perspective anyway. A few sample images and news search results — if there are any — have been rolled into the web search results list. Google also now offers the ability to narrow by related search. The various search types (which were displayed immediately above the search field) are now at the top left of your screen. Additional search types are available through a dropdown instead of a link to a separate page and they are reduced in number. Compare for yourself. Here's Google.com and here's the Canadian variant. I can't quite see the point of this. But oh well. It's not earth-shattering.
I'd just like to say that I've really enjoyed reading the comments. Thank you. I love reading your personal stories about school lunches. I also see a lot of opinions about the photos and about food options in your children's schools. And every commenter who tells me to keep going is also appreciated. The best part of the comments is that we are opening a dialogue about school lunches in our country. *** And I've done another email interview. This time with mother nature network : An interview with school lunch blogger Mrs. Q Thanks Robin! *** I think when we look at under-performing schools and we want to change those numbers, we need to question everything. Teachers' skills, abilities, and training are often addressed in the media as a big part of the picture. You know, I attend quality professional development activities through my district every 1-2 months depending on the schedule. That's pretty darn good if you ask me. I always learn something new. But nowhere have I ever seen anyone think about what we offer children for lunch. Let's think about what we give students to ingest. For instance, I personally enjoy eating hot dogs maybe every 4-6 months, mostly in the summer cooked on a grill. Also I eat them when I go to the ballpark as a special treat. But I wonder if we should give a child a hot dog lunch and then ask them to take the ISAT (state test)... *** In 2004 Jamie Oliver launched an effort to improve school lunches in the UK. He started a program called School Dinners and he wrote a manifesto about what he wanted to see happen in the school lunch movement (I love the word "manifesto"). Not all schools accepted his new program, but many did. In 2006-7, the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at Essex University comes along and decides to study 11-year-old kids who ate the new diet of fresh food for at least 12 months. Results: An independent study shows the performance of 11-year-old pupils eating Oliver's meals improved by up to 8% in science and as much as 6% in English, while absenteeism due to ill-health fell by 15%. The researchers controlled for other variables and compared the results to the schools where the kids did not have access to the fresh food. WOW. That's all I can say.
I've been inundated with emails and notes from various Alzheimer's charities and groups about their promotions leading up to World Alzheimer's Day on September 21. We're right around the 2 year anniversary of when my dad was violently taken from the house after trying to kill my mom, and thus he started on the horrible spiral that led to his death 2 months later. I can't bear to read it again, maybe I never will, but if you are interested it starts here. I can't imagine when I will ever be able to look back at the months of September, October and November 2007 without pain. Some days I can't even bear to think about my father. It's usually when I am alone, driving, when it hits me--a song on the radio, passing a store or restaurant he liked, or even a random chain of thoughts that leads me to think my dad was stolen from me and no matter what drugs they come up with now, I can never ever get him back. Then I drive the long way home, until I finish crying. Which is my excuse, I guess, for neglecting this blog. I think about writing, but it stirs everything up, and then I end up in front of my computer crying into my cat's fur. Here are some of the campaigns that have been brought to my attention lately. If I missed yours, let me know!
Today the kids and I had lunch at my inlaws house. Sebastian was in a bad mood and kept grunting at anyone who disturbed him while he was eating. In an attempt to get Sebasatian to verbalise his discontent we were encouraging him to say"go away". Sebastian mimicked the words with litle enthusiasm however Marcus on the other hand expressed this phrase with great enthusiam. He was so cute that we couldn't help but giggle and of course this lead to him repeating the words over and over again, causing us to laugh even harder. I knew that I would suffer the consequences of our collective actions and it was only 1 hour later when we were at the video shop and he walked away from me chanting "go away, go away, go away" Oh the joys!!
A quick update... 1. My husband's health is much, much better. Despite the surgeon's ominous prediction that there would be no return of pituitary function, he now has almost full function. The endocrine system is doing great, except for a slightly sluggish thyroid. This is a huge answer to prayer, and I am thankful for all of you who prayed for us. 2. Life has been busy. At times it has been both sad and stressful. I wrote, months ago, about "deep waters". While the waters are not quite as deep as they were, and we're not spending as much time in them, they're not exactly shallow yet either. 3. We are part of a wonderful fellowship of believers. I can't begin to describe what a blessing they has been. Did I mention that these people are wonderful? 4. Life has not been all stress and work. We've carved out time for fun and relaxation too, and made some hilarious family memories...and a few are even captured on video. 5. Coffee is good. Still. Always. That is yet again proof that the natural order of the universe is still intact. 6. I saved the best for last: Offspring #3 (aka, "the strapping young man") is ENGAGED!! But it gets even better. He's not just engaged to anyone; he's engaged to a terrific young woman that people can't seem to say enough good things about. We love her! Is that cool or what?
I do love Shaun White. I LOVE that he could have ridden down the center of the pipe and still taken gold, and yet, he put forth the ride of his life…and had FUN…you nailed it…he has fun with what he does. I'm so bad, I don't know anyone's name…I just get a kick out of watching them all. I don't love watching hockey, though…because my personal belief is that NHL players shouldn't be in the Olympics. I get WHY they opened it up to professional athletes…but I don't have to LIKE it. I cheer for our American athletes…because I'm an American…but I can TOTALLY appreciate the fact the woman's snowboarder from Australia put forth a better ride, and be happy for her. (I just would have been happier if an American woman had won) I also totally admire an athlete like the woman's skeleton rider, who had a horrific injury, and came back and was able to compete at the Olympic level again.
Today's menu: rotini, meat sauce, green beans, cherry-flavored icee, breadstick, butter, milk. I enjoyed this meal. The pasta and meat sauce weren't bad and I appreciated the variety of rotini (versus spaghetti). I guess the green beans had some kind of butter sauce. I didn't taste a sauce but there was a little buttery residue on the bottom of the paper package. The icee was very sweet. I sucked down a few sips and then stopped. I talked to a couple students about the meal. They said they liked it. I asked if they ate everything and one didn't eat the green beans. Both didn't eat the breadsticks because they were "too busy talking" and ran out of time. In other news I have definitely determined I'm lactose-intolerant this weekend when I ate some ice cream. So I'm no longer going to take a milk when I purchase lunch. I could try and take "lactaid" with me to work, but it's a lot of fuss so I think it's just best if I avoid all milk.
Exploring Rheumatoid Arthritis & Pregnancy I'm a 29 year old nearly-newlywed – and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I was diagnosed just over a year ago, only a few short months after my wedding. It's been a bumpy road over the last year, but I am finally at a point where my health is in fairly good shape and I am essentially in remission (meaning I have limited swelling, pain and fatigue). But, that remission comes at a cost. That being some serious medications.
To balance out the disappointing preschool stuff, I should mention that both boys are making unprecedented progress at home and ABA. Yesterday the ABA therapists said that they'd tried G. on matching words to pictures, and he seemed to get it. He won't do picture-matching tasks-- we think he just doesn't see the point. They also started working on writing letters. When they originally tried to get him to trace letters, he got very upset, I guess because it was messing up a perfectly good letter. But writing his own letter isn't so upsetting, or so we hope! B. is singing up a storm. He is stuck on the line "the mommies on the bus go "shush, shush, shush", for whatever reason (??), and he also keeps repeating "I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas". Either one of those things would have seemed impossible a few months ago. And with some encouragement, he'll point to the sentence strips I have around the kitchen and mutter, "Wan nuk (milk), peezh" or "Wanna cookie". That is really, really amazing for me to hear.
Interleague baseball was first proposed in the 1930s. It took some 60 years for the first game to be played. What took so long? The answer lies in the traditionalist heart. The first Interleague game was in 1997, and was the brainchild of the owners to boost attendance and revenue. And although it gives us fans an opportunity to see players we wouldn't normally get to see, I'm going to go on record as saying I don't love Interleague games. Maybe I'm not a fan because I'm bitter that the American League dominates. Last year, the AL enjoyed a combined 149-103 edge. Boo! Or maybe I feel it takes away from the uniqueness of the All-Star Game or, more importantly, the drama of the World Series. Or maybe it is just a combination of all of it. I was reading Mark Newman's article on MLB.com today and learned that Interleague attendance just keeps growing. Mark states, "Total Interleague attendance has risen every year from 2002-08, going from 7,741,496 over 249 dates in 2002 to a little shy of one full ballpark under 9 million in 2008." Also in this article, Bud Selig is quoted as saying, "As long as I'm here, we will have Interleague Play. I love it." (Hmmm. My other least favorite thing in baseball -- home field advantage in the World Series based on the All-Star Game winner -- was introduced by Selig, too. Hmmm. But I digress.) Baseball attendance is down four percent this year, in my opinion, due to the economy. Baseball officials disagree, claiming that attendance is down due to the fact that the new Yankee Stadium and Citi Field each have 15,000 fewer seats. Whatever the reason, it will be interesting to see if the attendance for the scheduled Interleague games this season continues, on trend, to grow, or if Interleague attendance also declines. If regular season Interleague baseball is here to stay, there is something that has been proposed numerous times before by players, sports journalists and fans that I really think would make Interleague games more interesting. Play by the visiting team's league rules. For instance, if you are playing in a National League park against an American League team, use the designated hitter rule so that fans who don't normally get to see the other league's style of ball in their stadium get to see it first-hand. Just an idea. What are your thoughts on Interleague Play? Peace, Love, And Baseball, Alyssa
OK, time to remind oneself I support the Hollywood writers' strike. (Grumble.) I do, I really do. (Grumble.) I'm not a huge TV watcher, but I'm really starting to miss this season's hot new drama — and my newest fave — Cane. The show is about the trials and tribulations of a rich and powerful Cuban-American family, and I was hooked from the very first episode. New episodes of Cane have been noticeably absent, along with those of most other intelligent, well-written shows, for several weeks now. In their place: reality shows, tired re-runs, third-rate movies, and other drivel. Surely viewers are revolting. I'm surprised there haven't been riots in the streets. With two fizzled awards shows and pending Oscar disaster, Hollywood screenwriters are demonstrating the strength inherent in being able to collectively withdraw labour. This dispute is about the same issues that continue to concern Canadian writers. Movies and television make billions of dollars for producers and investors, and secondary digital uses such as DVDs and Internet downloads add to the windfall. Writers want the right to share in the profits generated by material they have created — a not unreasonable position. Industry executives aren't budging and negotations broke down in December. The strike's economic costs, both direct and trickle-down, are skyrocketing daily. With the Oscars pending, pressure is surely mounting for all parties to kickstart the stalled bargaining process. They writers will win this thing. They have to.
As his body weakened, it was as if Mark grew even stronger. The last few times I visited him, I felt as if I were standing on holy ground. Jesus shown that brightly through Mark. It sounds cliche...but it was true. One local news story reported that Mark Riddering "lost his battle with Lou Gehrig's disease". That doesn't seem accurate. From what I know, and what I've heard from his family and friends, Mark finished the race, the long tiring marathon of the last 15 years, and he finished it well. He fought the good fight. He kept the faith. He persevered to the end. The prize is now his. He didn't lose; he won. Tomorrow I have the awesome yet sad privilege of attending the funeral of a true hero of the faith. Mark Riddering has left behind an awesome legacy. I cannot help but think that Jesus greeted him with the words, "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
Last spring, Noah (Ethan's pistol of a little brother) wanted to do karaoke at are local amusement park. We said that he'd have to learn a song, practice, and then he could do it. To our surprise, Ethan told us that he wanted to do it too. Ethan loves to sing and watch American Idol, but I was surprised that he wanted to go up on stage and perform. He's done plays at school and always learns his lines/songs, but it was hard to get a read from him as to whether or not he enjoyed the process. It seemed like he did. He learned a song (David Cook's light on) and they both did a great job. Then last month a school notice went home about the school talent show. Little Noah loves an audience and said that he wanted to do the show. Ethan, once again said that he'd like to be in it too. They formed a trio with their friend Jake, practiced with the whole crowd of kids for 3 weeks, and performed "Just One Person" from Snoopy the musical. It's quite moving to think about Ethan enjoying performing. I always enjoyed performing and I think I'd have a hard time explaining why I liked it so. I liked the process. I liked having audience reaction. I wonder what it is? But in any case both my boys enjoy it too. I'll also admit, I'm quite emotionally moved that my little boy who wouldn't turn his head at his name, who didn't call me 'mommy' until 4 1/2 years old, and who seems to spend so much of his time in his own little world enjoys performing and did a wonderful job at the school talent show. I'm so proud of both of them.
How would you describe time? Does it fly by too fast or stand still? Do you know “where the time went?” It's hard to believe we're already a decade into the 21st century! Ten years ago, we had concerns about Y2K and how it would wreak havoc on the world. Now we're dropping the double zero's as we head into the year, “twenty-ten.” Like it or not, the clock continues to tick, ringing in a new year every 365 days. Do any of you have January birthdays? I do. In addition to celebrating a new year, in the coming days, I'll be adding another year to my life. That's a good thing, I guess. It's a whole lot better than the alternative! With the passage of another year, many of us reflect on the years gone by and the milestones of our lives. We often revisit the days of our past and wonder how we made it this far. Or, we relive an occasion that brought joy to our hearts, causing us to smile once again.
Grrrrrr Those Numbers Are Frustrating!! Try as I might, I don't seem to be able to consistently keep my blood glucose level where it's supposed to be. Oh, there are always times when I know exactly what I splurged on that shot it up, and I can accept that as a rare occurrence. It's when I think I've eaten a really good diabetic meal and still have a high reading that is so frustrating. Hubby thought maybe my testing equipment was just registering high, after we read an article stating that home testing equipment can give results as much as 20% in error. So, just to see what would happen I double tested for several days last week, using the same blood drop with two different testing kits. Sometimes the second one would be lower, and sometimes it would be higher. But both kits consistently showed me too high when it went over the limit my doctor set for me. So I can't blame it on the 20% inaccuracy findings. I seem to be particularly susceptible to a glucose rise if I eat most whole wheat breads, something I thought I could have in moderation. So it's a small piece of sour dough bread with lunch and occasionally a few whole wheat Melba toast pieces with dinner. And I can only manage a very small amount of fruit, which seems to work better if I eat it first. I guess it gets mixed in with the rest of the meal that way and doesn't have a chance to make a big spike of sugar. So, in effect, I eat my dessert first now. So I continue to learn what my body will tolerate and what it will not, and we both read everything we can get our hands on that might help me beat this disease as quickly and completely as possible.
As I've mentioned in a number of my posts, my ADD spouse and I separated several years ago because I just couldn't take dealing with his ADD issues any more. Even though he had been on medication and in counseling for 10 years, there were still many problems, especially in the area of communication. As our marriage disintegrated, the communications got worse. So when we decided we wanted to try to salvage our marriage, my husband's counselor (who also knew me from some joint counseling sessions we had done) suggested that we should try a different approach to communication. Instead of discussing things at any old time, and getting into communications problems constantly, he proposed that we have several formal meetings each week where we would talk about problems and conflicts, matters that might require negotiation, plans, and status -- just like in a business meeting. The rest of the time outside the meetings we would only converse on pleasant topics -- like social chit-chat, or anything else we both enjoyed, unless it was something exceptionally urgent (like, "the house is on fire"). The intent was to create a context for my husband to be able to focus his attention on the items we needed to discuss, while freeing him the rest of the time from having to try to pay attention when his mind was already engaged with something else. With some reservations on both sides, we began scheduling meetings and trying to work within this framework. I found it frustrating to "hold off" talking about matters that arose that were important to me, until our meeting -- when I see a problem, I want to tackle it NOW! -- and my husband initially had trouble with being prepared for the meetings, but we adjusted after a couple of months. Business meetings are usually set for definite periods of time, and we quickly learned that we needed to do the same -- at first, my husband could only maintain focus for an hour at best. Often that meant that topics got deferred to a later meeting, which was very frustrating for me. But as we became more practiced, he was able to increase his focus time, so this problem eventually went away. Normally, people don't yell at each other in a business meeting, it's unprofessional -- at first we didn't implement this concept in our meetings, and we ended up with some meetings being just one concentrated yelling spree. Since my husband can't think at all when he gets upset, our discussions were going nowhere, so we adopted this business policy as well. This was very difficult for me to implement, since I'm an impatient angry sort of person by nature, but it was well worth it since the reduction of the emotional tension made it much more possible for my husband to apply his mind to the subjects at hand. Other problems arose: my husband took few notes, and so some of things we'd talk about never got "on his radar screen" for follow-up; when he took notes, they were often so vague that he'd misinterpret them later on and then we'd be at odds about what had been discussed; and worst, he'd forget the date/time and not show up, or show up late (even though we created a regular schedule!!). These were serious roadblocks, and it took some pretty hard work to deal with them. To help my husband take better notes, we'd compare notes at the end of each discussion, or at the end of the meeting, to make sure we had both captured the same information -- he would read back his notes, and I'd identify any discrepancies with mine, and then we would mutually resolve the discrepancies. In the process of making sure we were "on the same page", we'd also be able to ensure that his notes were more detailed and less vague. As far as the lateness/forgetting problem went, we agreed to implement a rule that if he failed to renegotiate a meeting date/time ahead of time, and was late or a no-show, that the meeting would be rescheduled at *my* convenience (but I had to be fair and not just schedule a bad time for him as "pay-back"). There were other policies we found useful to implement, through trial and error. Since it wasn't certain there would be enough time to cover everything, we decided to cover "logistical" topics first (e.g., who has what appointments coming up this week, who is picking up the dry cleaning when, etc.), then topics where some decision was necessary, project status, and such, and finally more nebulous topics that involve some negotiation or conflict or exploration. Before we instituted the meetings, my husband often felt that I was always the one driving the discussions, so to avoid that we developed a policy that we would address his agenda before mine (not necessarily his entire agenda -- but his logistics before mine, his project status before mine, etc.) When my husband would agree to take on some task in our meetings, he'd make notes about it but wouldn't necessarily set a particular target date -- and without a target date, he would have no reminder alarm in his PDA or anywhere else, so it often wouldn't get done -- so now we set up a target date in the meeting as well. When I would ask for status on some item that he was supposed to be working on, he'd sometimes have a hard time remembering what he was supposed to have been doing, and it slowed down our meetings a lot to go over it -- so now he does a brief review of his notes of the previous meeting before we start each new one. We fiddled with the frequency of our meetings at times, but generally have found that three times a week works best for us. We both sometimes relapse into bad old habits, but we now have the mechanisms in place to correct those problems when they occur. Once we ironed out these wrinkles (after about six months), we found that the meetings not only accomplished their intended purposes of providing a structured context for discussion and negotiation plus better interactions outside the meetings, but they some pleasant unexpected results as well. My husband has become much better at follow-through, because he knows there will be a status check in an upcoming meeting, and this has reduced my need to nag. I've learned how to address conflicts without yelling (well, most of the time). We have a much more structured dynamic for communications, which leads to fewer misunderstandings. My husband's note-taking has improved so greatly that we rarely need to do re-caps anymore, which shortens the meetings and again contributes to better follow-through. And the meetings as we have set them up provide a method for coming back to unresolved problems, with the chance to review the notes and reflect during the intervening time -- this has been an important element in reaching an accord on many of the more fundamental complex problems surrounding ADD behaviors. I've resisted the urge to end with a bullet-list summary of "rules" for setting up such meetings: this kind of setup should not be a straight-jacket, and I think that each couple has different problems and therefore needs for different rules which only they can discover as they work through this kind of process themselves. I think the only real rule is the original intent -- to create a context for focused attention on interpersonal matters, and to exclude those discussions from the rest of your interactions. This isn't a perfect system -- it doesn't always work smoothly every time -- but it's a very helpful framework. Suffice it to say that these meetings were a key component in ending our separation -- I really don't know if we could have resolved our communications problems without them -- and we have found them so helpful, we are still holding them more than four years later! They can definitely be a powerful tool in the ADD-coping toolbox.
School lunch costs me $3.00 per day. I don't carry cash. The cash part of this "experiment" has been pretty challenging. I do carry bills, but they are usually twenties and disappear quickly. Open your wallet. Do you have three singles? Would you be able to acquire single dollar bills for every lunch this week? It's been oddly difficult for me. The lunch ladies don't make change. I have shown up with a $5 and they give me a look like I think they are some kind of shiny ATM. Grudgingly they find the money, but I often have to wait for it. So since starting this project, I have had to be creative with my money. I've borrowed money from my husband (indefinite loan). I've stopped at businesses and bought random things just for the change. One day I stopped at Star*bucks before work and bought a drink. I never do this by the way. I asked the barista, "Can I have change in dollars?" He asked me, "You need it for the tolls?" I stammered with a smile, "Yeah, basically." I'm sure he knew I was lying, but I didn't want to get stuck in a long discussion not to mention my concern about my anonymity (there might be other teachers waiting for their cappuccinos). I mean, what do people need singles for? The only thing I can think of is going to a strip club. Mr. Barista was left wondering what I was up to. I certainly look like an exhausted working mother -- not the kind of gal gearing up to go to Chip*n*Dale's.
Today's menu: meatloaf, bread, fruit cup, mystery greens (!), milk To qualify for the label "meatloaf" I think meat should be baked in a loaf pan and then sliced. So given that definition, it is obvious that what I ate today is not meatloaf, but instead a meat patty. And I was so thrilled to see what I assumed to be spinach!! I was floored. But then when I took a bite they were so very bitter. After work I chatted with my mom about it and she thinks they are collard greens. Frankly, it looks like spinach. But I'm not sure it was. All I can say is that this was the first time I could not finish my veggies during this experiment. I had three bites of the most bitter greens I have ever tasted. Can someone enlighten me as to what I ate? So basically I ate the meat and the bread for lunch. Additionally, yesterday's "day-glo" cornbread muffin was normal colored in real life. There are flourescent lights in school and I also use a cell phone camera so I guess that made it look funny. The picture didn't look very distorted to me though.
Wow, what a weekend!!! Let me start off by saying that we will NEVER fly using Southwest Airlines ever again! All 17 of us flew out of Islip Airport in Long Island on Thursdays and arrived in Chicago at Midway Airport. My sister in law, Eileen, and her husband's 2 suitcases, missing and NEVER arrived for the whole weekend. They had to go out and buy clothes for the wedding (which they were reimbursed for) and then yesterday, lets see.... finding out that one of Eileen's bags had been found in Florida, my other sister in law, Kerry's boyfriend's luggage not arriving with his flight, my brother in law, Christopher (THE GROOM'S) luggage not making it to their honeymoon destination and to top it off, they lost Joey's carseat!!! Keep in mind, on the way home, there was 3 different flights and on each flight, someone lost luggage. And I wouldn't have been so mad about our's, but come on, a car seat?! Thankfully, they had loaner carseats so we were able to go home and also thankfully, Joey's carseat was found by the time my in-laws flew in last night so they were able to bring his carseat home with them and Southwest Airlines is going to pay to have the loaner carseat FedEx'ed back to them.
One day last week I wore a pair of pants to work that I bought for $5 (online and on sale). I love to get a bargain when I shop for clothes. I know full well that I'll probably get a year out of them and that'll be it. It has taken me most of my life to realize that there are things that you buy on sale and things that you spend more on. Over the past year I took stock of my shoes and realized that I had bought too many "for the right price" and too few for their quality. When I analyzed how many pairs I actually wore and why, I figured out that my favorite pairs are high quality shoes I spent a lot of money on. So I threw out all the pairs that don't fit right or my foot jiggles in or the ones that rub my ankle raw if I don't wear them with socks (inevitably I forget that fact and wear them to work without socks). I spend the whole day on my feet so quality shoes are a priority. Then I bought myself a couple new pairs that cost me a lot, but I realize the high cost up front pays off: my back and feet don't hurt! My husband and I are the rare duo that both enjoy food shopping and we buy quality food. We are lucky to be able to splurge on little indulgences and bigger ones sometimes too. For our family, organic options matter. I enjoy cooking (my husband doesn't know how to cook, but he can boil water) and shopping is the natural extension of that experience. We're passing on a love of food to our kid and we make sure to buy the best that we can afford. Why can't we give all children the best possible food we can find while they are at school? Why do they have to get the cheapest stuff? If their health and wellness is truly a priority, then we need to pony up and find a way to feed them as if they matter. Children are not "little adults." They are learning and growing every day (I'm only growing out not up). There are some things you spend extra money on and that would be this nation's kids.
Like I said in a previous post, there will be some gaps in school lunch consumption in February. So instead of my usual lunch post, I'm sharing a photo I took of a vending machine that I saw at a different school. When I walked by the vending machine, I was taken aback. It was visually shocking. What you see are lots of pop*tarts on the bottom, rice*krispie*treats on the top, and some generic peanut butter cracker/cookie sandwiches. I felt obligated to take a picture of the vending machine because it startled me. I did it as discreetly as I could and I tried to keep moving so I don't know how much the items cost. I should also say that there was another vending machine nearby that held the usual assortment of chips, chocolate, and candy. Many schools have given up vending machines due to the belief that they are making children obese. I think there are many kids who eat unhealthy foods right after school. If you have a vending machine snack that has upwards of 200 calories every single day after school, you will start to gain weight. I was trying to find more articles about vending machines in the schools. What I did find were some companies that are trying to develop healthy vending machines. I personally like this idea a lot. What do you think? Is there such a thing as a "healthy" vending machine? Here are a couple companies that I located online:
Today's menu: Rib-a-cue, whole wheat bun, corn, apple, (milk). So the "rib-a-cue" looks bad, but when I opened the package, it smelled terrific and it actually tasted really good. Today I was offered a choice (!!) of the rib-a-cue or lasagna. I didn't see the lasagna sitting out so I decided on the rib-a-cue, which was sitting in a big stack for the kids to take. I'm starting to become friends with the lunch room personnel. I was always nice to them before but we're definitely establishing a relationship! Someone commented that I'm eating lunch everyday.... if they only knew the whole story!
Yesterday Mr Man was "not fine". He was very ill in fact. He was banging his head on his pillow in an effort to get the voices to stop. He didn't even hear me talking to him and seemed unaware of my presence until I put my arm around him. He told me he had to get on with his "work" again, and he had to mark himself with his number - 4064. I was worried that he was going to carve it into his arm with a knife or something. Later he got out "the folder". The folder has paper in it, and that is where he writes his "codes" and things like that - "work" that the voices have given him to do. He hasn't got the folder out since 2004. I couldn't believe his symptoms had deteriorated so much in such a short space of time, but I knew what the trigger was - we were supposed to be going out that evening to commemorate the death of Christ, and he was very anxious about it. Needless to say, we didn't go. Mr Man is still unwell today, but much better than yesterday, and typically he doesn't remember much of yesterday. I say "typically" because it is quite common for Mr Man to be unable to remember periods when he has been acutely ill. He's been a little unwell for a while now though. Just a couple of weeks ago he spoke to his Occupational Therapist about how he was feeling. She was concerned enough to start visiting him every couple of days, and she even gave him her mobile phone number in case of a crisis, but he didn't want to talk to me about how he was feeling. I didn't mind; I understood that he doesn't like me to worry about him, and to be honest I was just glad that he was talking to someone instead of keeping it all to himself.
I have not intentionally given up blogging. We are simply at a point where living our lives is taking up all of our energy. There is progress going on, and there is also a lot of poop, peanut butter, toothpaste, urine and other stuff to clean up. We are having lots of fun in general, but it's a very energetic type of fun! Lots of chasing boys across soccer fields, through Target, and so forth. I always wondered what would happen when they got too big for strollers and shopping carts and now I know. I like to think my cardio vascular health must be getting great. Hope to return to blogging before too long.
Hi Kristyn! I thought this was a really well done blog on sensory integration dysfunction. I will pass it on to others. I found out last year that my son is very sensory seeking. I had never heard of sensory integration concerns before my son started exhibiting signs of this dysfunction, and it was a very confusing time for me. I wish I had gone on-line and connected with others! Currently, I am trying to raise awareness about SPD through our book I Can Be: A Child's Whimsical Introduction to Yoga. I have been practicing this book with my son since he was a baby and little did I know that it was a great tool for his sensory concerns. A percentage of our proceeds goes to a local nonprofit dedicated to preventing developmental delays through education. If you get a moment, we also have a blog, our website is www.qandjbirdpress.com. I look forward to reading more of your blogs.
Our special children, these bright and creative ADHD children, can be such a challenge to parent. We watch them bounce around in our neuro-typical world, stumbling and falling more than their peers. We want to fix it and make it all better, as though ADHD is just a boo-boo, but it's not and we can't. At some point, we come to accept that it can't be changed. We even come to accept ADHD into our lives and our families and focus on the gifts despite ADHD. We focus on our children's talents and their accomplishments and love them unconditionally. But we worry about their futures too, the time when they are no longer under our wing and must learn to soar on their own. My son often gives me glimpses of his future and lets me know he's going to be okay. Not just okay, but great even. Quite often these glimpses are hidden in the most brief moments of peace and joy. These times when I am observing him and I am not worried but content and joyful. When he creates something unique, says something insightful, or achieves something so easy for his peers, I can peek into his future and be satisfied. That little moment when I realize I am at peace with ADHD.
I wondered whether you may be able to offer some advice. I'm an Occupational Therapist working for the NHS in Sheffield;UK. A group of professionals have started to plan an ADHD group for Adults and we are generally involved in developing a service for this client group (very little support available currently). We are struggling to find information / research / examples of groups which we can learn from. We have a number of ideas including using psychosocial and behavioural interventions and have flirted with the idea of incorporating a sensory integration approach. However we are concerned about the little evidence on sensory integration and ADHD. My question to you is this: Can you point me in the direction of any evidence / journal name or particular paper /examples of good practise / contact name / ….etc for Adult support groups and Sensory Integration. If you do – I'll think yer amazing and tell all my colleagues about how wonderful you are!!! Does this encourage you?!* Anyway thanks for the website – it's already proved very useful and I look forward to reading the updates, Liz.
One of those men was Mark Riddering. We barely knew him when he helped us move, but that didn't stop him from eagerly volunteering to help. As we got to know him...well, I have to admit that he sometimes made me feel like I did when I was a little girl and hero-worshiped a heroic policeman. Mark Riddering was a good cop. He was a true hero. He was also one of the sweetest, kindest men I've ever met. I loved watching him interact with his kids, loved watching how he looked at them, how he played with them, how he so obviously cherished them and his wife. He enjoyed life...enjoyed his family...enjoyed his many, many friends. I don't think I'll ever forget his smile or his laugh. We knew Mark during the time when he began noticing troubling symptoms, and when he received the diagnosis of ALS. He was an important part of the weekly Bible study that first met in his home and later in ours. We all watched him walk through this time of uncertainty. If he felt sorry for himself, we never knew it --- his concern was always for his family...and that he would be found faithful in God's eyes. Over the months and years, we watched his big strong body deteriorate. Never once did we hear him complain. Instead, we still heard him laugh and still enjoyed his smiles, his loving concern for our family, and his sense of humor. He encouraged others over and over again.
Showing Improvement Well, I've been on the antibiotics and other meds that my Gastro put me on for over a week now, and I'm beginning to see progress. I still have problems with my tummy, but the constant feeling of nausea is gone ... and good riddance! We wrapped all the presents and filled the stockings last night, so we're all ready to enjoy the next few days with our family. We'll all be together this Christmas, and that always makes it extra special. Some years we have to share our daughter with her in-laws, which is only fair, but I'm glad she and her hubby will be celebrating with us this year. We've had a particularly rewarding Christmas this year already, helping a large number of families find replacements for lost or bedraggled lovies for Santa to put under their Christmas trees! We've received wonderfully excited thank you's from many of them, and each time one was received it just made this Christmas that much more meaningful. It can't be said often enough that it really is more enjoyable to give than to receive!! My hope and prayer is that you have a Christ filled Christmas this year, too!
According to my psychiatrist SID is a dysfunction disorder under ADD/ADHD. I found a site about it, after researching why I had such sensativity to smell, sound and touch. The sight calls it Sensory Processing Disorder, instead of SID, now. There are different check list pages to see if you or a loved one might meet the criteria. When I did it, I was amazed. I met almost everything. Its very interesting, I wondered, since I take ADD medication if that could actually make the sensory sensitivity worse. I also have PTSD. But after 9 years of being misdiagnosed, I am happy to be functioning pretty well with the ADD medication. As long as I dont let a rebound effect take over, I metabalize the stuff fast, and that even if it is XR. I can also take a Clonazapam to relieve my oversensitivity at those times. For me the ADD medication, while still activly working in my brain, even makes the SID normal. All of the meds and diagnosis are tricky and time consuming, plus alot of trial and error and if lucky a positive!!
I supported it. Frankly, I never thought I'd live to see the day when people would try to redefine the institution of marriage and would then try to impose their ideas on others, even to the point of forcing all couples getting marriage licenses to have to be identified as "Party A" or "Party B", rather than as bride and groom. When suddenly marriage has become about something completely different than what it has always been understood to be...when it is no longer about a bride and groom, but about two "parties"...well, I finally decided enough was enough when it comes to people trying to impose their new definition of marriage on all of society and on our legal system. This social experimentation had gone too far. Some time back, I wrote this: Save Marriage!! Defend Marriage!! I still think that the greatest threats to marriage come from within marriage itself. We are the ones who threaten our own marriages, through all manner of sin, whether it be just plain selfishness and irresponsibility, or lust, adultery, pornography, abuse...the list goes on. I wish more of us were willing to spend our time, money and effort vocally and effectively fighting those very real threats against marriage. But, in the meantime, I helped my son get signs put out. I spoke out where and when I could. And, sometime over the next few weeks, I hope to blog about why this issue is so crucial to me, and why it should be crucial to you as well...and why we need to speak out now.
Well, I finally did it! I'm out of the stock sites. As some of you know, I have been experimenting with selling my artwork online through half a dozen stock photography and microstock sites for a couple of years. While they were generating income, the experience has never been ideal. Uploading was time-consuming, especially with so many sites. It was frustrating to have certain sites reject an image for utterly arbitrary reasons, while others accepted the very same image. And I certainly didn't enjoy giving away 50% of my income to these companies for the privilege of hosting my art. I felt none did a good job of marketing or promoting my work. I had already had my own site, Fractallicious, up and running for about a year, functioning primarily as a signpost to direct interested people to the various stock sites and other places, such as CafePress, where they could buy my fractal art. Fractallicious was successful in that regard, but once potential customers landed on one of the stock sites I had sent them to, I became a tiny fish in a huge ocean of competitors. Income trickled in in dribs and drabs. So I set out to be my own stock site. Turns out, I sadly under-estimated the challenge involved in turning a static web site into a full-blown ecommerce application. It's been a long tough slog, with numerous technical difficulties, but we're finally there! The company we chose, Volusion.com, provides a turnkey ecommerce platform, allowing you to create an online store with a powerful database back-end, shopping cart, and merchant account services. The Volusion technology is robust, complex, and highly configurable. Because of this very complexity, it's also far from intuitive and comes with a steep learning curve. The company scores an A+ for the superb quality of their 24/7 technical support. So, starting this week, I have eliminated the middleman! (And, no, this is NOT an April Fool's joke.) I'm partnering with my sister on this endeavour, and we're not only selling gorgeous (if I say so myself) high-quality image downloads, but also certain images printed on a variety of merchandise, CafePress-style. My rainbow designs have been very popular with the gay and lesbian community, and we're starting with three of them printed on 1" buttons, and attractively packaged as a three-pack for gift giving. Drop by Fractallicious.com, and have a look. If you like what you see, please feel free to spread the word!
By A Customer My husband was diagnosed with an extremely severe case of colitis then Crohn's disease. All that his doctors were doing were prescribing higher and higher doses of drugs (sulfasalazine, prednisone, etc.) which were making him sick and caused him to drop pounds daily. Then we heard about Elaine Gottschall's book. It has literally been a life saver!!! The author provides both an explanation for the diet and a simple guide of "do eat" and "don't eat" foods in list form. My husband felt like he had his symptoms under control within two days! He was able to stop taking his medications with no complications. At last, no more stomachaches. After two years of being on this diet, my husband has shown remarkable improvement after follow up tests. However, don't expect your doctors to support this diet, they don't want to give up their hold on prescribing expensive prescription drugs! Even more unbelievable, the specialists we've seen are completely ignorant of this book! Incredible. This diet is completely natural and relatively easy to follow, especially considering the alternatives! Buy this book for yourself or for your loved one who suffers from this disease. It can change lives. We cannot thank Elaine Gottschall enough.
Most people have heard about the holiday blues, but not many have heard of the holiday flares. For those of us with rheumatoid arthritis this time of year can be the beginning of very painful season. There are many contributing factors to why you may experience a flare during the holidays; bad eating, stress and depression, just to name a few. Your RA symptoms may increase due to these factors and can make what should be a great holiday into a flare to remember. The fact is we can not always control our symptoms, but we can make choices to help avoid the pitfalls of pain. The most important tip that I can give you is to slow down. There are a million things to do and not enough time to do them. So, keep it simple. Your house doesn't have to look like a Christmas museum in order to feel festive!
Yesterday was the last day of winter break. Our two boys had some gift certificates to spend at a local book store. When my husband and I saw I Don't Want to Go to School written and illustrated by Stephanie Blake, we had to get it. I didn't read the book first and now regret buying it because it's really too young for us. The hero, Simon, seems to be a kindergartner who is afraid to go to school. The guy we were thinking of is eleven and in the fourth grade. Also, unlike the hero, my guy has autism and his problems with school go way beyond anxiety. (He just doesn't like it, and we're still trying to figure out why.) Anyway, by the end of the story, Simon decides he likes school so much he doesn't want to leave. That is great, but it makes me wish that was the case with my child. He always wants to come home!!! Don't get me wrong. The book is cute. My six year old liked it a lot when I read it to him, though it seemed a bit young even for him, let alone my eleven year old. I also noticed something a bit off about the book. It's a picky point, but Blake depicts Simon writing his name in cursive on one of the pages. This is something a second or third grader might do, but certainly not a kindergartner on his first day at school! Further, there are signs all over the kindergarten room on one page in the book. All the signs written in cursive. I've been in many a kindergarten room and usually all the signs are printed. So, that is another thing my son does not have in common with Simon. He might not ever write in cursive. It's hard enough for him to print his name. C1's team at school and I think his problems with school might have to do with writing. My team and I learned about how to solve writing related problems at START. Hopefully, I'll blog about the topic of hand writing soon. As far as this book goes, it seems most appropriate for young children who are just about to enter primary school (though I like Wemberly Worried, a similar book, by Kevin Henkes a bit better). Blake's pictures are bright and cheerful and the story depicts Simon having a lot of fun at school, but as a mom of older children I wish I had passed on this one for something more age appropriate.
That's what he would call himself. When I met him online, he was pastoring a tiny little church in some little Texas town. But he was one of the smartest men I know, with a mind that would never forget anything. The first few things I found out about him is that he loved Jesus, loved his family, loved teaching, had a special place in his heart for mothers and babies, and was hilarously funny. Eventually I found out he had put together a lengthy series of lessons from the Bible dealing with a certain topic in a way that infuriated me, scared me...and then set me free from a lifestyle and church that was sucking my soul -- and the souls of my family -- dry. It sounds trite and corny, but this man changed my life. Sometimes I'd tease him that he ruined my life. I'd say, "Here I was, happily living a life of crushing rules and regulations that I kept failing at, until you came along and ruined my life with all your talk of grace, freedom, and joy." I only met him once in person, but it was one of those unforgettable visits that our family still talks about, over a decade later. He and his wife became "Uncle Mike and Aunt Marilyn" to our family. We fell in love with their adorable baby boy. We spent a lot of time talking and laughing. They felt like long lost family. Just a little bit ago I got the news: "Mike has been promoted to Heaven." I can't help but think that Jesus greeted him with the words, "Well done, my good and faithful servant. Enter now into the joy of your rest."
I have been losing chunks of memories. I have been experiencing it much too much lately and so I went to see a psychiatrist who told me that achalasia or my anemia could be part of it. He told me to see my primary care physician and ask him to recommend a neurologist. I am going to do it. I have an appointment to go see my Doc this afternoon. In the meantime I did some research and here is what I found. Read the entire article. Warning: You may need a medical dictionary to decipher some of the article. The following quote is just a very small bit. But it is important to read the whole thing and maybe one of you readers can tell me what you got out of it. Maybe I misunderstood it."The corollary to this is that loss of argyrophilcells may have the same clinical effect as totalneuronal fall-out."
At my school the kids get 20 minutes for lunch, which is bell-to-bell time. So lunch time includes waiting in line, getting your items, finding a seat, opening your food packages, EATING, throwing out your trash, and lining up to go back to class. If they don't finish it all, they have to throw it away. Taking food back to the classroom is not allowed. I think kids get about 12-13 minutes to eat maximum if everything goes as planned. If their class is the last to get into line, well, they might have as little as 5 minutes sitting at the table. Well, it just doesn't seem like enough time to eat. It's hard enough for the teachers to grab a bite in 20 minutes. After taking the kids to the cafeteria, getting my meal together (using the microwave), chatting with a teacher, and using the bathroom, I might have about five minutes to eat. Also the food prepared in the school cafeteria is very often meant to be eaten by hand. So that's pretty easy to do in 5-10 minutes. It can't be utensil-friendly fare if you only get a spork. I personally can wolf down food when necessary, but I am an adult. Imagine a little person who maybe eats a little more slowly than an adult. Do they actually eat very much in 5 minutes? I guess my wish is that all kids get 30 minutes to eat. Lunch is about learning too; it's not just filling an empty stomach (and sometimes they don't even have a chance to do that). Lunch is a break for students to chat with their friends in an informal setting. Learn about foods and enjoy eating.
When you and your spouse are first exploring whether or not ADHD has been a factor in your marriage it can seem both a relief (finally, a reason that explains so much!) and a bit overwhelming (ADHD seems to be everywhere!) Some with ADHD resist thinking about how much ADHD can impact their relationship because it makes them feel "broken" or lessened. I asked myself the other day - does it matter if you label it ADHD? The answer to that question is yes and no. Knowing about ADHD really helps you find the optimal way to improve your life. But you don't have to "label" it ADHD in your everyday life. Here's an example: For years my husband and I laughed because he is a man who needs to exercise pretty much every day else he can be cranky, unhappy, disconnected and hard to live with (and also doesn't sleep as well). We now realize that this is related to his ADHD and that exercise is one of his forms of "treatment". But does it matter that we now know that it's ADHD related? Not really, as long as he's exercising. It's just HIM and one of the things that is part of him (with an excellent side benefit for me, in that he's in great shape!) What does matter is that you (ADHD or not) get a chance to put your life in order in a way that satisfies you and brings you joy. (Note I say YOU here. No one is obliged to satisfy anyone else.) For those with ADHD who are travelling a journey to find out what brings them joy, the label of ADHD is useful insomuch as when you know you have ADHD, then you also know that using specific tactics that are shown to work for people with ADHD is the fastest/best way to get to your goal - and sometimes the only way, given how ADHD works. I always remind people - don't try harder, try differently - and by that I mean try those things that are known to work for ADHD because they will work better for you than other approaces simply because of the way you are wired. While it once completely controlled my life and my husband's life, ADHD is now almost non-existent in both of our lives and certainly in our marriage. You can't imagine how much better things can/will get for you if you are able to think clearly and non-judgmentally about ADHD and what is already known about dealing with it. (And, for those with a learned fear of failure, having faith that good treatment means you don't have to continue to wonder whether you'll fail at what you try is also helpful...but that's a different post!) ADHD is only a curse if you fight the idea of having it more than you fight to subdue it's symptoms. Once you subdue the symptoms then you can start to understand the great things that it offers you, as well. For some, those things include minds that move quickly and "see" things in unique ways; tenacity (my husband is a good case of this); an ability to love well and forgive quickly (because they live in the moment); almost unending curiosity...the list is very long indeed. There's a reason why the only guy for me has ADHD! Everybody else is just too boring!
Today's menu: Pepperoni pizza, milk, baby carrots, multi-grain apple mini-crisps, fruit cup. Our first repeat meal! I strongly dislike the pizza so for me this one was a rough. I got excited by the "mini-crisps" because I thought they might be dehydrated apple slices, but unfortunately they were rice cake-like disks. I liked the baby carrots, but I asked one of my students if he ate them and he told me, "No." The fruit cup was partially frozen. I did attempt to eat it. NOTE: The second picture is a decent shot of the mini rice cakes. Also you can see the pizza in the background. It's got a glassy film on top, which is called cheese. The cheese has separated into two layers, the "saran*wrap" layer and then the under layer. Yum.
Disneyland for little D is a mixed bag. He loves the rides but some of it can be a bit overwhelming. From the 6 hour drive to his problems adapting to his new bed, it is a mixed bag for my little one. Overall he had loads of fun though, and we came through another good experience together as a family. If you do decide to try doing this. Here are some tips I think you will find useful (I guess these probably work for any multi-day amusement park outing): * Before you go, think about how your kid is going to sleep. Something that has worked for us is to bring his bedroom fan and the bedding from his bed (his own pillowcase, etc). * Bring his diagnosis with you and stop by Guest Services to get a special needs pass, particularly if your little one has trouble with large crowds of people or standing in lines for a long time. This is a must and boon for the whole family - it makes the park a completely different experience for everyone, and it can help family interactions since it instantly makes him very popular amongst siblings (since he has the pass and can skip lines with his party). * Think about the sensory conditions of the place vis-a-vis your kid. If sensitivity to sound is a problem, lights, proprioceptive input etcetera, and try to match his/her temperament with the conditions of the ride. If your kid has never gone into any rides before, you may want to take him on something that is outdoors and low-key first (this type of ride can also help to relax him afterwards). For example, a favorite “relaxing” ride of my son is Heimlich's Chew Chew train on California Adventure, which is the Bugs Life character made into a train and goes outdoors inside a giant collection of food - the odors of the different foods (watermelon, animal crackers) permeate the air as the train goes. * Keep close guard on him if he's a runner. A crowded mega-park is not the place you want to lose track of your kid, particularly if he's nonverbal. Consider using tags or something else with your cell phone on it. If you don't have anything, even black marker on his or her belly (“If lost call (999) 999-9999”) is better than nothing. * Consider your kids' limited diet. You can bring food into Disneyland. * Find quiet areas of the park as you walk and pick those places to take a break. Take out the food at those times. Also keep track of the nearest bathroom. * Something I noticed and I wished I had done was have lunch in the Tiki Room. Little D loved the room, it relaxes him to watch the birds and hear the music and once even fell asleep inside. You are allowed to eat in there as long as you pick up after yourself, which is great to keep fidgetiness to a minimum. Because there really is no bad seat you can stay outside away from the crowd until the appropriate time comes (you may want to let the attendant know how many are in your party and that you will be doing this) and then just show up. Or if your kid will allow it, enjoy the mini-show in the courtyard. * Take some video, but not too much that you don't interact with your kid. Your kid smiling and his eye contact will be priceless to remember.
Well I'm having very little computer time because unfortunately my laptop is acting up and my hubby is still trying to diagnose the problem so we can get it fixed. I have to steal moments on his PC when I can so I may be sparse, we'll see. Now on to the point, Adrian's teacher called me today. She wants me to come meet her at the school tomorrow to talk about how we can help Adrian communicate better at home. I'm assuming she's talking PECS, which we know all about, but I'm hoping and looking forward to any new ideas she has. I NEVER turn down a chance to meet up with the teacher so I wasn't about to say that I didn't need advice! My conversation with Adrian today: Me: Did you have fun at school today? Adrian: (silence) Me: Did you have fun at school today? Did you play outside? Adrian: Outside! Me: Did you go down a slide today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Me: Oh you went on the swings today? Adrian: Slide! Swings! Recess! Me: Oh you had recess today? Was that fun? Adrian: (Silence) Well it was some what of a conversation, I'm pleased!
I went to the doctor today. I have gained one pound in two months. But keep in mind that I'm no angel outside of work. For example, we just had Valentine's Day and I ate a lot some chocolates. I also want to let you know that in December I did have blood taken, I did a sugar fast, and the basic stats were run. At that time I was normal. I did have low HDL (the good cholesterol), but my overall cholesterol is fantastic. Why did I do that? Well, I have awesome insurance that gives healthy adults a yearly discount if I get a physical and basic blood work done (thereby proving my health status). I love the policy because it's common sense. Plus it's a great way to discover a problem before it turns into something. Preventative versus reactive. It's way cheaper to give discounts up front than pay for a major problem five years down the road. When those tests were run, I hadn't even fully come up with the idea of the blog so it's really fortuitous. Whenever this project ends, I'll be able to compare pre- and post-data. That being said I haven't been feeling myself recently. I'm having more stomachaches and that's why I visited the doctor. I'm looking into it and I'll keep you updated.
I am a family of people suffering from arthrits. My dad and uncle Tibs' bodies were so disformed it was pitiful. My hands are swollen mostly in cold weather. I am in pain most of my day. I have been told I would sooner or later have to have hip replacement. HIP REPLACEMENT, this is so scary. I my town all we have are quacks that can't be trusted for anything but taking our money. This I know because I have friends who have gone to these doctors. Doctors here think getting old means 'YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT. I have no way to get to a surgeon that I can trust and you say 'stress' causes more problems with my arthritis. What am I supposed to do. Thanks for the shoulder.
Doing Great! I'm really feeling good these days. My stomach is behaving itself, and I'm encouraged by the strength that is returning to my legs. I was able to manage a couple of fairly steep driveways on our yard sale haunts on our Date Day without using the cane. That's quite a victory for me, as I can't remember how many years it's been since that was true. I'm gradually adding back in all the supplements I was taking before my stomach got ulcerated again, and so far there's been no stomach problems. That's a true blessing. I'm also encouraged by my ability to learn about the new programming language that our new sites are written in. It's slow going, but I am gradually understanding how the code is working. I'm very proud of that. I'm still going to sleep most nights at 9:00PM and getting up around 5:00AM, so I'm getting plenty of sleep. I usually only wake up once in the night to make a bathroom trip, so my bladder is behaving, too. I'm getting closer to my goal of losing 50 pounds by April 1. I may not hit the date exactly, but I'm not going to miss it by much. With the lowered rate, and the care hubby takes with his grocery shopping, my blood glucose numbers have been mostly excellent for some time now. Of course, there's the occasional high number, but I usually know what I've eaten to cause it, and learn accordingly. All in all, I'd say I'm in the best physical and mental state I've been in for years, and I hope it continues.
Thalassemia is another disease that has the heterozygote advantage. This disease is very similar to sickle-cell and it also prevents malaria in heterozygotes. This disease is caused by a mutation and it causes the body to have fewer red blood cells than normal and less hemoglobin. This disease can be deadly at an early age, but in the case of a heterozygote, it can be left untreated, have blood transfusions needed, or just eating healthy. Sickle-cell is found in people of African ancestry, while thalassemia is mostly in people with Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, southern Asian and African ancestry.
I am always pushing for the reduction of the stigma surrounding mental illness. It may be my error to think that we have made progress. What I infer from this article is that universities have regressed when it comes to social acceptance of mental illness. This is something that began prior to the horrifying Virgina Tech massacre. Read the article to learn the extremes that are being taken against those that are mentally ill. With statistics like one in four Americans diagnosed with a mental illness, the number requires more mental health support. There are too many people that are not seeking the help they need. The response to the health problem the universities are making for anyone, let alone a huge number of the population, are insufficient. There is a quote in this article from a politician, Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston who is open about his mental illness. I can only hope those voices in important places like his, and those of the entertainment industry like Patty Duke and Carrie Fisher, will continue to speak and unveil the misconceptions. I can only hope.
G's latest occupation: holding a number placemat and singing first "This Old Man" (one to ten) and then "There were ten in the bed and the little one said, Roll over" (ten back down to one). He has found the ultimate, never-ending song! Our college student who comes in the afternoons is out of town, and my sanity is already a fragile thing. I am plotting to go to every store which has the carts which will hold two or three kids (Target, HEB, Randalls, there must be more). I've been working hard on getting them to walk with me in public, but I still need a "strapping in" option when I've got all three of them. It feels so strange to me that I can't take my kids out by myself. When they were younger and slower-moving, I could, but these days it's just not safe. Everyone tells me this will get easier, and I just have to assume they are right!
It's a while since my last post and that's partly because I didn't have a great deal to say and partly because I was busy trying to get my life in order. I now feel as though I'm making some progress. I mentioned previously that I had been medically retired from my job and, at the age of 53, that wasn't really in my plans. Aside from anything else, I've always been a very busy person and I felt as though my days didn't have much of a purpose. I had lunch with my former work colleagues last week and that was my 'leaving do'. It was lovely to see them and they gave me gifts and cards with lots of lovely messages (which made me cry!) but then it finally felt as though that chapter of my life had closed and that I can move on. So, I have applied to the local CAB to do some voluntary work and things have moved really quickly - I have an interview there on Wednesday so fingers crossed! I have also re- started learning Spanish - I began last summer but got distracted and now I'm trying to make up for lost time. it's great because I really feel as though I'm making progress this time around. I am also wanting to take up a new hobby. I used to do lots of cross-stitch but my hands won't allow me to do that any more so I am thinking of trying crochet which is not such fine work. So, we'll see how that goes. All in all I feel much more positive about things.
Shaun White is 23 years-old now but only 11 in that clip, same age as my daughter. And – AND! – he was born with a heart defect that required two open-heart surgeries before he turned one. Despite that inauspicious beginning, he started snowboarding when he was six, won his second gold medal in these Vancouver Games, and is the acknowledged master of the sport. Ever watch him compete? With the other snowboarders, both his own American teammates and the riders from other countries, there is sometimes a stiffness in their routines, a nervous quality that comes across even on television. Incredible athletes all, and snowboarding tricks in general demand an uncommon kind of bravery and audacity of movement, but Shaun White's fluidity almost makes them look wooden in comparison. When he goes on, he appears to be just playing. His performance is all, “Hey guys, gonna have a little fun here now, k?” as he bounces around the halfpipe and, in the tradition of all athletes at the top of their game, makes it look easy.
If you lined up all the teachers and staff in my school in a search for who might possibly write a blog like this, I would be one of the last chosen. In my professional life, I don't make waves. I avoid conflict. I'm a "yes" man. I do what I'm told, but I love my job so it's not hard. In my personal life, I'm more opinionated and although I'm a deeply private person, I tell my friends and family exactly how I feel. Few coworkers have crossed over into the actual "real life friend" category. So it's very easy for me to compartmentalize. Before this project happened. Now I'm feeling majorly exposed. I could absolutely lose my job over this. In just the first ten days of school lunches I've gotten a bigger response than I expected. It makes me nervous. Most teachers do feel the same way that I do about the lunches served in the building. So that's reassuring. We've all discussed the lunches and how bad they are in passing. Then we go back to teaching. No one has done much. I'm not a hero, but I am a whistleblower. But instead of calling a "tip line," I've shouted it to thousands of people. Oops.
SOOOOOOoooo I almost didn't make it to the gym tonight. My legs hurt with every step I took today; it didn't help that I slept in and got to work late so I had to park way back at the end of the parking lot. In the afternoon I was sitting at my desk and I thought I was having a heart attack because I had chest pains.... then I remembered benching yesterday. By the time I got home I was tired and sore and just a tad bit grumpy. I was making lots of hints that i did not want to go to the gym and I was just waiting for Scott to fold and say lets not go because I didn't want to be the one to say it. Well finally at 8:00 he convinced me to get my fat, lazy butt to get up and go and I was already thanking him for making me go five minutes after we got there. Thanks again Scottie so Hottie! Cardio 10 minutes on the elliptical going alternating between one intense minute at level 13 and and one recovery minute at level 6. Try it.... 10 minutes may sound like a piece of cake but when you do intervals and push during those hard minutes it makes a world of difference! Weights-- Planet Fitness has a 30 minute weight circuit with cardio boxes in between each one. We got a full body weight work out and did all kinds of jumping, lunging, squatting, stepping, hopping, and dipping in between. I was very nasty and sweaty which in my book equals a good work out. I highly recommend trying one of these cicuits if you gym has one or you can make your own my planning a workout routine with cardio in between.
So I'm coming out. I am not plus-sized, but any stretch of the imagination. I am one of those women that "mommy bloggers" love to hate: right this moment, at the age of almost 52, I am wearing junior size 5 jeans. This is 12 years after giving birth to the last of my six children. I doubt that any of my three readers will gush, "Now I love you even more!" but I refuse to be ashamed of my size. Not any more. I am a real woman. I think that carrying six children to term and breastfeeding them for over a year each -- and having them thrive on the milk my "inadequate" body produced -- more than qualifies me for real woman status, no matter what curves I may be lacking. I do not apologize for not being plus-sized, nor do I apologize for not even wanting to be plus-sized. Sigh. I know. I'm supposed to be worried that my words might be construed as being "size-ist" and "intolerant", and completely lacking in "fat acceptance". I should instead be an "advocate for plus-sized women". I should drop my head in shame and apologize to people, "I can't help it that I'm thin. Really. I eat twice as much as you, but I can't gain weight no matter how hard I try." But, you know what? That is simply not true. The truth is: I exercise. Not fanatically, not three hours each day, not even consistently as much as I should to maintain the best health (e.g., the recommended 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise each day plus strength training to maintain muscle mass and healthy bones at my age). Most days, I don't overindulge my appetite. I don't bake as a hobby and don't consume frequent desserts. The type of food I have grown to enjoy the most is relatively low fat and free of rich, creamy sauces.
Do women really have more severe arthritis than men? Are we more open or honest when answering questionnaires? Or are we just more likely to complain? Those are the questions raised for me by a research study published in the January issue of Arthritis Research and Therapy (and the many subsequent news articles written this week). It's long been known that more women develop RA than men, in fact, 70% of people with RA are women. Other gender differences have also been noted. Both men and women have relatively equal disease activity (number of joints affected), damage to joint structure and deformities. However, while men generally have a higher incidence of rheumatoid nodules, higher mortality rates, and are more likely to be RF positive; women generally are more likely to have RA, have more severe symptoms, higher erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR) rates and report greater rates of functional disability and work disability. Other studies have found that men are more likely to have periods of remission. Men have also been shown to have higher response rates to biologic drugs; but on the other hand, they also have higher rates of adverse events and serious infections with those drugs.
Whew! After hours of frustration, I have succeeded in moving this blog's template over into New Blogger. I did my best to maintain the same look and feel, but there are subtle differences. (You can see the old template by clicking on the thumbnail at left.) And what a learning curve it's been. Hopefully, the results will prove worth it. One of the major benefits of New Blogger (and certainly my primary motivation in upgrading to widgets view) is the new labels/categories feature, evidence of which you can see at right below. Those who have been with me for a while will be familiar with the various not-so-successful code hacks and workarounds I have employed over the years in an effort to give this blog that all-important missing functionality. I posted recently on the changes needed to get the 3-column Minima template that I give away here working properly in New Blogger layout view. That was a piece of cake compared to this blog's template, because of all the customization I had done. New Blogger didn't like my classic template at all, and the easiest approach to feeding New Blogger widget view something it could digest proved to be to rebuild it from scratch. I started with the 3-column Minima template, but you can only get so far dragging widgets around the screen. To get the functionality and look and feel I wanted, I had to delve into New Blogger's XHTML code, which is a whole lot more obtuse and less forgiving than Old Blogger's code. (Tip: all tags must be closed, even IMG tags, or they will generate error messages.)
All of my trips to this southern Philippine city had always been for business. My first visit to Cagayan de Oro City, or CDO ,as most Filipinos refer to it, was a decade ago when I was there to hold a training workshop with the local affiliates of the organization where I used to work with. Despite the fact that I had never been to this place during that time, I traveled alone as the advance party; an irony, now that I think about it.
With only the moon and the stars to light our way, we stopped by a souvenir shop that glowed through its fire-lit lamp. The waves were our only reminder of our location. We walked along the beach with our bags in tow and rested at a medium-size open-air hut filled with soft lights. The sound of a big lizard kept our senses alert.
I finally make it to the gate with only twenty minutes to spare. With so little time, it turns out I could have left my purse, book and bottle of water in the car and saved a lot of hassle. My mother comes off the jetway beaming like a little kid; she is so excited to be here. I grab her wheel chair and begin to push, all the while wondering, how after 358 days of travel I could have been caught by security twice. My, how quickly we do forget.
Second-universal health care is not the answer. It's a larger problem. Insurance companies have no incentive to save money to those they insure-the hospital passes the increased cost of the uninsured onto the insured. Hospitals should start incentives to pay in cash. Why should they bill you more if you pay in cash than they do the insurance company?
The weather in this part of the globe is once again changing. The slight chill in the air has ebbed away and Philippine summer seems to be entering earlier than expected. It’s not really a sudden shift because in our tropical country, weather conditions could be rainy, normal (dry and warm), and warmer.  Most of the time, the sun would be out.
But by last week everything had changed. I received an email from someone named Corie which I was about to delete since I didn't know a Corie and certainly all emails from people we don't know contain virus' right? Then I noticed that after her name came the phrase: Thank You and Package Mailed and the mention of the name Sharon. I backed up my computer to protect all my data before opening the email (not really) and there it was - a reference to my knife. Sharon had given my knife to one of her guests, this woman Corie from New York City, to mail to me upon her arrival back to the US. And sure enough, several days later, the knife arrived at my door step.
Third-pharmaceutical companies in the US subsidize the lower cost of research drugs for the rest of the world-especially those countries with universal coverage. US pharmaceutical companies do all the R&D and FDA approval process-other countires are then allowed to buy from the pharmaceutical companies in bulk-increasing their residents savings. Allow pharmecutical companies a percentage cap of profit for US citizens say 10%-thus forcing them to reap their profits from the other countries around the world. Make other countries subsidize their share of the pharmecutical companies. Once they pay their fair share-they may not be so quick to tout the benefits of universal coverage.
I'd dare say your not as good with women as you wish you were, you're looking for something that can take you above and beyond 99% of men for free, it's here, you just have to reach out and grab it
Stan, you say you miss him and didn't even know him. Not true. Every day on this site, he shared a piece of himself with you and many others. You knew him well. You are right to be missing your friend.
Lots of things in life don't die but instead evolve or get reinvented. Such is the case with this blog. This has been a great blog to write and we have had many dedicated followers over the past one and one half years. But now it's time to move on from this blog to... another blog.
Part of the Spanish army came to the Chapala Valley and surrounding area. They were led by Don Alonso de Avalos who arived in 1531 and set up the province of 'Avalos' which included Tuxpan, Tuzantla, Sayula and Sahuayo. The Spaniards also converted the native peoples to Christianity. Beginning in 1545, a large influx of Spaniards arrived in the area and began to exploit the natural resources of the area. In 1567 the Marquis de Folces turned much of the land into large cattle farms. By the end of the 16th century much of the area was monopolised by the Hacienda de Guaracha.
Also-start a secure transmission database for perscriptions-that way people will not be able to forge signatures or visit tons or doctors to abuse perscription drugs. This would also cut down on potentially harmful drug interactions. Or dosage mistakes due to sloppy handwriting. This will also cut down on the malpractice claims.
How I missed that this time around. I miss his voice. And the new season of TV shows has started. 24 one of our favorites, is back with all cylinders firing. Jack Bauer and the gang had a huge two-night season opener, but there it sat on the TIVO. No Leroy to share it with.
Everyone has their first time and they remember it: the anxiousness, the uncertainty, the wariness, but also the excitement at potential new findings, the rush of adrenaline, the majesty with which you are able to fling yourself into the great unknown.
After we had our filling meal, we headed to a nearby cave, which had a very large opening. The cave was like a theater stage, large enough to accommodate a house inside. We were told that the cave is now considered biologically dead, brought about by the damage done by treasure hunters and the bright lights of the Survivor shoot.
Hai, Sasha here.To me, women was very easier to lose their weigth because everywhere we can saw no men in this world do housework accept forced. women was did the housework and its can be women was very easier to lose thier weigth....Anything you want to commentttt???????
No matter what measuring stick we use, we have all come here and found a place that is our safehouse. We can talk about death, we can talk about treatments, we can laugh, and we certainly know we can cry together.
Finally our dinner was served and we feasted on the local delicacies including grilled fishes. Chatter filled the air with the sound of the sea providing a beautiful background. We met a German woman who was there on her own, embarking on the adventure of solo traveling, and engaged her to talks about the place.
A "lengthening tally of losses." That's how Maureen put it into words in her comments to the blog yesterday. She was reacting to the news of Randy's death. His name has been added to the others who have passed through our community. Some stayed with us in time measured in years, or in Randy's case, measured in weeks.
