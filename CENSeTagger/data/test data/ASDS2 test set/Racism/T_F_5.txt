Our biggest problem today is the niggers and the illegal aliens who have come to suck on welfare. They are what makes me sick. Niggers whine for equality, but they have a problem with white people. It's their fault that they live in shacks. Their people put them there, not us. TV has become black. Hearing them speak ebonics on television makes me sick.
