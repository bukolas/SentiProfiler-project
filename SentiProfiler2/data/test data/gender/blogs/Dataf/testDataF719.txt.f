Thai Airways made the almost 20 hour flight from LA to Kathmandu, Nepal as comfortable as possible.  The beautiful fabric on the plane's seats and the colorful, "uniforms" worn by the gorgeous flight attendants put passengers in a Thai state of mind as soon as they step on the plane.Passengers are given a choice of 2 Thai meals and everything was delicious.  Meals were served on china with real silverware, even in coach.
