We started early in the morning as we rode for about three hours towards Batangas, a province south of Manila, the capital. We reached a small port and boarded a boat that carried fourteen of us. It was about 45 minutes at sea until we reached our destination, Bonito Island. I’ve heard of the island but I’ve never been there. Finally, I would attach an image to the name some friends have been mentioning about.
