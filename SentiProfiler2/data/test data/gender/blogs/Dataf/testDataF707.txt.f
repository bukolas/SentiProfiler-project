This review is for Maybelline's new mascara, Lash Stiletto. I purchased this mascara, in the hue Very Black, from Wal Mart about a week ago and have proceeded to use it every single day since then. My Lash Stiletto  purchase came with a bonus waterproof liquid eyeliner, in black, at no extra cost. The total for this duo came up to about 7 dollars, which I believe to be a very good deal considering the impressive quality of this product. The price will be different in various parts of the country, but from what I understand, Lash Stiletto by Maybelline usually runs between 7 to 10 dollars.The actual mascara "tube" is very eye catching and cute. Modeled after the heel of a stiletto, Maybelline make an interesting play on this product's name.
