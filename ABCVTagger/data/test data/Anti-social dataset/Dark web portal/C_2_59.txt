Alhamdu lillah. all praise be to Allah. i've been waiting for this statement since the "fabricated" news/propaganda concerning the amir al-mu'minin capture was aired/released by kuffars, kuffars supporters and/or kuffar funded media, a couple of days ago. May Allah always protect, help and strengthen the amir and all mujahideen everywhere.
