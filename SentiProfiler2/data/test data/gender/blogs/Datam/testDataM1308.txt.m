Arrived home from work this evening to a letter from the hospital. I've just had my monthly blood test and I immediately thought it might be a recall for another test because my numbers were high. Or low. But no. The letter reads: 'An appointment has been made for you to see Rheumatology Nurse All Grades or a member of the team'. And that's it. No explanation. No reason given. I'm not even asked if I'd like an appointment, or whether one can be arranged that's mutually convenient to me and 'Nurse All Grades' or the NAG as I'll now think of them / it. Am I alone in thinking this is a bit rude? I don't get summoned without explanation by my dentist, or my optician, or my vet (well, not my vet, the cats' vet, but you see what I mean). I feel like giving them a piece of my mind but I fear I've few enough pieces left for myself. I'll give them a call. I'm sure there's a good reason.
