I would like to say I was cool before my kids. I would like to say that my husband sucked all of my awesomeness out and this is what is left, a shell of a woman that talks about her kids to much. That back in the day I was a woman with a sense of style, that I looked great and rocked a room when I walked into it. However none of that is true. Truth be known, my kids and my husband are the best things that have ever happened to me.
