Hi all, It's been a while since my last post as not much has changed, i am still managing on 12.5mg Methotrexate weekly and 75mg Diclofenac daily, my last blood tests showed that i am still anaemic with low ferritin levels (as i think ive said before i just cannot tolerate the iron (Ferrous Sulphate) tablets), so i am now waiting for a date to have another endoscopy to check for ulcers which i ain't looking forward to. My joints are not too bad at the moment on the lower Methotrexate dose although my skin is creeping up again. I hope everyone is bearing up and ok, all the best
