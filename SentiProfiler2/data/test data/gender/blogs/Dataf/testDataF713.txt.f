I flew on Jet Blue this summer with a group of teachers. I had heard a lot of bad things about Jet Blue and was hesistant to fly with them. The flight was booked through a trip coordinator so I had no day in the matter.
I was so pleased with the service, the plane and the flight in general I would love to fly Jet Blue whenever possible. There was a wide variety of snacks to choose from and the flight attendants were very efficient.
