This week my World is a happy one. Spring is here! My regular readers (both of you) will know that I have of late been whining about the never ending winter. Well, it's over. This last week has been more sunny blue skies than grey ones and on my walk I found the first colourful evidence that made me smile and feel energised, optimistic and yes, full of the joys of spring! Remember this pathway, recently flooded? Well, that's where we went for our walk. We, I hear you ask? That would be myself and my kitties, of course. Yes, they like nothing better than going for a walk with me. Come along Sylvester, do keep up. Wait for us Kitty. Isn't this fun boys? Look at the first colour of Spring Are those Snow Drops - of the good kind? Spring colour to make me smile. Bright happy yellow. You have no idea how these little flowers make my heart sing! Have you enjoyed your walkies? Come along, time to go home boys! For more views and stories from around the blogosphere, check out My World Tuesday . I've featured the view of the Steam Museum Tower from Waterman's park before , as well as from some other vantage points. This time I thought I'd share with you the results from a "lets-try-something-different" weekend photo-stroll through Waterman's Park.&nbsp; It was this past Saturday, a bright sunny day and a treat to be out enjoying the much missed bright sunlight, the blue skies featured so wonderfully between the moody clouds. Of course it's not quite spring yet, so this merely a tantalising glimpse of what is yet to come. A little taste, offering hope, to sustain me for a few more weeks before the reward of the long awaited arrival of spring.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to that, you might have gathered and think of all the wonderful photo opportunities. After all, spring in the UK is a very special time. Until then, enjoy some more lets-try-something-different pics.

The Thames carrying all that rain away met the incoming tide and the two watery forces were more than the banks could hold, so a little flooding occurred. There was once a pathway there! Here's a view from summer showing where there used to be a pathway along the side of the river. Not to worry though, this is a seasonal thing and not an unheard of occurrence. Once the tide goes out, it takes all that excess water with it and life returns to normal.&nbsp; For more interesting posts from around the World, check out My World Tuesday . Pickle or Gherkin? Well, it's commonly&nbsp; known as the Gherkin and I've blogged about it before here . The building is in fact the home of Swiss Re , who are the Worlds second largest re-insurer. Founded in 1863, Swiss Re operates through offices in more than 25 countries. 30 St Mary Axe , also known as the Gherkin and the Swiss Re Building , is a skyscraper in London's, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004. It is 180 metres (591 ft) tall, with 40 floors. Its construction symbolised the start of a new high-rise construction boom in London. The building was designed by Lord Foster, his then business partner Ken Shuttleworth and Arup engineers, and was constructed by Skanska of Sweden in 2001â€“2004. The gherkin name dates back to at least 1999, referring to that plan's highly unorthodox layout and appearance. Due to the current building's somewhat phallic appearance, other inventive names have also been used for the building, including the Erotic gherkin, the Towering Innuendo, and the Crystal Phallus (also a pun on Crystal Palace). &nbsp; Read more of the Wikipedia article here .

It cheered me up no end. One of the landmarks, as seen in my neighbourhood, certainly adds a bit of bright colour don't you think? It's the Cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Church (abroad) in Chiswick.&nbsp; This small but beautiful cathedral has been built by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), which is independent of the Russian Orthodox and the Patriarch of Moscow. Unlike the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia, ROCA never compromised with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or with the Communist Party and did not enter into communion with the Patriarch of Moscow and the Church in Russia following the fall of Communism and the limited freedom granted by the post-Communist Governments of Gorbachov and Yeltsin to the Orthodox Church in Russia. ROCA is however in communion with the Serbian Orthodox Church whose Patriarch Pavle is now living in Kosovo trying to protect the Christian Orthodox holy places, churches, monasteries.

Yes, no surprise there, but we live in hope, or more accurately, London where it's winter. Uughh. Dull London skies behind bright Piccadilly Circus lights. Yay! Enough of that sky, lets go home.
