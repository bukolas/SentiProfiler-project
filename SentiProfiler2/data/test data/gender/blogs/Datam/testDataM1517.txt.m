I used to watch Dr. Who on PBS with my dad in the eighties.  I am not into sci-fi at all.  My dad is a Trekkie and into the Who series deeply.  Out of all his interests, I shared in Dr. Who simply because it was a series I could follow because it centered around time travel.  Time involves most of what we do so it was practical in a sense.  We have wondered about the validity of the past, the future and how we apply the present.   Dr. Who's cast involved real people who were relatable.  In the area I live now, I was quite disappointed to find the local PBS doesnt air Dr. Who.
