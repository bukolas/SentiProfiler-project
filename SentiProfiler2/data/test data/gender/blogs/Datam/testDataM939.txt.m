Whats going on fellas! 
We now have ourselves our very own Blog Site, for the Book Club. This will be our meeting place for our weekly discussions on the book we are currently reading. I have created accounts for each of the members of our club to be able to post to this site.
Its official, we have have a Forum to express our opinion's and ideas.
