The optimistic meaning of life is what we all search for. Isn't it? Always the beauty of something so complicated, is put into such simple words, Soul, Love, Life, Understanding, Acceptance. Everything is so much more, you cannot express it in such simple words. Everyday people die, and no one really recognizes, everyday people form and no one really recognizes it, and why? Because were to busy searching for happiness, were all working, to get somewhere, where we think success is. People strive off of happiness, or the idea of it. Its so hard to find, and often times people think they need to be rich and be very successful to be happy. That is completely irrelevant, happiness is inside of you, within you. When you are completely accepting of yourself, its when you can be happy by yourself, no help from others, to know that if everyone you know left you, you could still be happy at least a little, by yourself. I'm becoming happy again. Katie Day has helped me become happy again & I want to thank her for that. I just hope it last! I have learned that the people in your life the just wakes up one day and just leaves you behind and act like you dont mean anything to them and it really does make you feel so down in the dumbs you dont want to do anything! Eat, can't sleep or even get to the point where you dont even dream good, thats when you just get up and learn to face the fact that they never have two shits about you. Don't do what I have been doing, dont not eat, sleep, or even get to the point when you dont even want to do what you really enjoy. I ask you please! Dont do this! Just live you life like im learning to do again.
