Batman has made an impact on my life. I've refereed to him in a few blog posts over the past couple months, but without sharing too much information. I think I am finally ready to talk about him a little bit. He has taught me a lot about my self. He's helped me mature a bit and help define what it is that I am looking for in a life partner. He entered my life in an unexpected manner. I was sitting at a computer in a Sydney Hostel. I saw a friend request on FB. His name sounded familiar, so i accepted his request. We began exchanging emails and finally agreed to a date. The next month was truly a whirwind. We met each others friends, spent a lot of time together, and whenever we were apart all I could do was count the minutes until we would be together again. I do recognize that things moved WAY too quickly in the short time that we were together, but we really connected on many levels. He brought something out of me that NO ONE has ever in a relationship. He helped me feel so good about myself. My self esteem had never been higher, I felt sexy, I was proud of myself, I liked ME for who I already was. I never realized that having someone treat me the way that he did, support me and care for me, would have such a HUGE impact on my life. Let me explain this a little further, in past relationships I had love, care and respect... but I was still somewhat unaffected. Meaning I would still have low self esteem, not like who I was, always trying to figure out what I needed to change about me. I love these past men, but none shook me and looked at me the way that batman did. That is why its is hard for me to let go of him, and unfortunately I do. He's not in the place to be in a relationship, and I really respect the fact that he recognizes this. To me it demonstrates his maturity. He easily could have dragged me along or went through he motions like others have. It was so hard to hear that from him, and he had to say it a few times for me to really get it. But I do finally get it, and he and I are friends today. Its funny how feedback differs from my friends. My male friends (even those who never met him) think very highly of him for being straight and telling me that he cannot date now. This has earned their respect. My female friends, on the other hand, keep encouraging me to move along and forget about him. Its funny how the male and female mind work differently. At first I was devastated... and I do still get sad from time to time. But I think I've finally had a breakthrough. If he was able to make me feel this wonderful, there must be SOMEONE else out there who can also. It may have taken me 33 years to feel this good about myself, I may have to look for 33 more, but I now know that these feelings exist. I've been going on quite a few dates lately, meeting a lot of men, but they sure have large shoes to fill - because batman sure raised the standard a LOT and made this girl incredibly picky. I will not settle, because I now know and understand that I deserve nothing but the best... which is the same for all of you! I have a gym buddy. He's pretty cool. We met at the gym, imagine that. He came into the gym one night and I recognized his face, so we started chatting come to find out not only do we work in the same building, (when I am in the office) but we sit three rows away from each other. At first I thought he was cute and interesting. It was cool getting to know him we even went out on a dates. Then we ended up on the friend shelf. For the first day or two I was a little disappointed, because I was a little interested in him - but this has been for the WAY much better. I have a new male friend. I don't have many of those, but the ones I have are very close to me and I greatly value their roles in my life (Storm Warning and Big Dan) Gym buddy and I have become rather close. We text, IM, talk on the phone all the time. It's pretty cool. He was the one who ran out and bought mace for me when he heard that my friend was raped last week. He knows that I have been really struggling with getting over the last man I dated (batman) and trying to help me get back into the dating world. He is the one who pushed me to get profiles on different dating websites on line, and he's been a cheerleader asking about every guy I've been emailing, texting, talking on the phone with, etc.F Tonight was a bit of a first first. I had a date tonight. or the first time I was nervous, not sure what to wear. Next thing I know gym buddy was giving me tips on my outfit. I felt my phone vibrate over and over throughout the night, just to see that he was checking in on me to make sure I was safe and didn't need an "out." I didn't need an out, I was ok, and I actually had a good time tonight. In all honesty it did not stop me from thinking about batman... but I was distracted for a little while. On my way home I checked in with gym buddy, he grilled me for all the scoop, for him to finally to tell me that he needed to get to bed because he was waiting up, worried for me. It's nice to feel special and important. I'm glad to have this guy as a new friend. I have a few more first dates lined up over the next few days. I'm not expecting a whole lot at this time, since I am not even sure I am in the right place to date, but its a step in the right direction for me, and it feels great having a cheerleader by my side. Southern Cross (Words &amp; music by Stephen Stills, Richard Curtis and Michael Curtis) Got out of town on a boat goin' to Southern islands. Sailing a reach before a followin' sea. She was makin' for the trades on the outside, And the downhill run to Papeete. Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas. We got eighty feet of'a waterline. Nicely making way. In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you. But on a midnight watch I realized Why twice you ran away. Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me larger voices callin'. What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten. I have been around the world, Lookin' for that woman/girl, Who knows love can endure. And you know it will. When you see the Southern Cross for the first time You understand now why you came this way. 'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small. But it's as big as the promise - The promise of a comin' day. So I'm sailing for tomorrow - My dreams are a dyin'. And my love is an anchor tied to you - Tied with a silver chain. I have my ship and all her flags are a flyin' She is all that I have left - And music is her name. Think about how many times I have fallen Spirits are using me larger voices callin'. What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten. I have been around the world, Lookin' for that woman/girl Who knows what love endures. And you know she knows. And you know she knows. So we cheated and we lied and we tested. And we never failed to fail; it was the easiest thing to do. You will survive being bested. Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you In the Southern Cross. -BTW I totally flew over Papeete when I went to NZ This week a few life-shaking things occurred to me and some friends. Two friends had medically-related scares with a parent. I had my job threatened for about 24 hours. Lastly, and most horribly, a friend was mugged and raped in her own home. What a week. with everything that has been going on, I hope the universe starts smiling down on a few people. I know that after all these things have happened, I am looking at my life a little differently and trying to make wiser decisions. I know that I've referenced my debt a few times before. It's not THAT bad compared to others, but its more then I should have. First priority it to pay all credit cards off by end of the year. That is totally feasible. I really need to do that in case anything were to happen to my job - unemployment won't cover everything right now. This means some sacrifice - but it will be worth it. No extravagant traveling for me this year. IN FACT, my next goal, once the cards are paid off, is to save up for my trips... instead of putting myself back in debt with them. Something I should have been doing a long time ago. Next I do want to look into some type of self-defense classes. I've thought about them in the past, but now, after what happened to my friend... I feel more of an urge to take them. Also a friend of mine has been on my case, telling me to carry mace, especially since I am out there dating... I told him last night I'd take him up on that offer for him to buy me some. Scary stuff - but I can't be naive about it. Life it too short and too precious to live with blindfolds on. I must prepare for the best of my ability, and then let the universe deal its course. Everyone please keep my friend in your thoughts, she needs strength to pull through it. Also hope that the bastard who did that to her is caught. On the good note, one of my dearest friends is going to be having her baby soon. I was able to catch up with her a bit last night, and it dawned on us that the next time we see each other, she will be a mama. Still makes me wonder (and hope) that one day it will be my turn. (ok, you can pick those jaws up off the ground now - LOL) That is what I am doing. I believe that right now I am the healthiest and strongest I have been in my entire life... that is from a mental health standpoint. I'm getting back into dating. I reallt don't have the best track record. In the past I'd meet someone and just let myself take that plunge. That can be good and fun, but I've learned that I don't really get to know a person all to well. We all know that a relationship can't be built on passion and chemistry alone. So I've been putting myself back out there. I've got a profile on a dating website. I've been meeting men while out and about. I've even been on a few dates, shared some emails, phone calls, texts. This time it seems different, I am trying to not put so much pressure on myself. I am trying to meet these men, get to know them a little better... then if any of them really catch my eye - then pursue the dating thing. This is a new concept for me. it's tough though. First of all there are a LOT of weirdos out there. There are men who are looking just for sex... and if that's the case, move along! I've had one particular man email me TWICE and comment how my combination of curves and brains must be hot to the touch... No thanks buddy, I'm all set there. The one thing that I am currently struggling with, is that when I realize that someone is not what I am looking for - and its time to start all over again, it makes me miss some men from my past. Yes, these relationships may not have been made to last, but I sure still miss some of them and how they made me smile. Just a footnote to my last post. This person who I was referring to is not a blog reader, so please, no one worry that I might be snipping anyone ties. Thank you all for the great feedback. I'm digesting it all and trying to figure out my next steps. How does one tell a person that they don't want to be friends with them? This woman I met through mutual friends seems to think that I am her new BFF. I am polite to her, we've hung out a little bit, but she seems to be always calling me, emailing me, asking me to make plans. She's a decent person, but she comes with SO MUCH FREAKING DRAMA. I understand that we all have to go through things and learn from our mistakes... but she's consistently asking me for advise when she really has no intentions of doing anything about it. She's clearly seeking attention and drama. I've previously cut people out of my life because they are too much. But I am not sure how to do this with her, since we share the same circle of friends... ..well, this is going to sound bad.. but some of the people in this circle don't like her either. Often people will make plans and specifically say "don't tell so-and-so" I feel like I am in high school or something. I pride myself on my communication skills - I don't often shy from confrontational skills.. but the idea of this one bothers me. I don't want to just disregard her... but maybe if I just remain someone cool to her, she will eventually get the hint. My Nevis song. This song seems to get me through the hardest times of my life at this time. My Nevis song is the song that came on as I was about to jump from the 3rd largest bunjy in the world. I was terrified, I cried, I did not think I could do it...Then logic and reasoning took over and I took that plunge. When I heard that song before I jumped, I thought of my friends, in fact one particular friend. My god that was the scarriest and hardest thing I did in my life... until that time. Little did I realize that life would keep handing me these challenges and try to keep kicking me while I was down. F you. I WON'T be taken down. I am better then any of that. I find that now, whenever I am facing a challenging situation I BLARE that song at top volume and remind myself that I am in control of my own destiny. I may do reckless things like drive like a maniac or whatever... while I am in an emotional state, but I am sick of other people dictating how I am feeling. I live for myself... I am strong enough to deal with what may come my way... I am better then that. I deserve to have it all, and I will fight for it, and I am worth it. F you world. I am in charge of me and I deserve nothing but the best.
