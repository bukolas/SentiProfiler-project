When Rafael Palmiero was outed as having used steroids, there was a mix of apathy (since everyone knew) and disgust (since he had lied to Congress about it). When Tiger Woods was outed as an unfaithful husband, again, people were a little surprised, but again mostly disappointed that he tried to act like it didn't happen.
Now it's Allen Iverson's turn. Iverson has always been a character, whether it's talking about practice or simply his bachelor lifestyle. Unfortunately for him, the latter appears to have caught up with him.
Hearing that an NBA player has been banned from multiple casinos for his gambling and drinking problems isn't much of a surprise. It isn't even a huge surprise when you know that it's Iverson. However, to think that a man who is 34 years old, has five children, and has been a father since he was 19 has yet to take steps to deal with a problem that not only could but likely will tear his family apart is a bit surprising.
 As Smith mentions, Iverson's career has been on a downturn in recent years. I suppose it should be no shock that the man who was too proud to further his career by taking a role as a backup should take this long to finally wrestle with his inner demons, but better late than never.
