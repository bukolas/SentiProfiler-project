I really think the show would be better if they kept the boys and girls separate until the top two. A two-hour show at this point is impossible to sit through, even with the help of Tivo. Tonight's comments from the judges were pretty good for the most part. My comments, in order of appearance:Michael Lynch is by far the best of the guys and will make it to the top few (although DialIdol.com disagrees).Didi was better than expected again. She's not my choice by a long shot, but is safe for at least another 3 weeks.Casey was better this week, but I'm not sure how long he will last. His song choice was not right for him
