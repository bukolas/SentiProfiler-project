Hi internets. Just writing to introduce you to the newest "moderator" for the Camera Toss Group on flickr. Jens Ludwig aka QuakkauQ , hailing from Germany, has been a long time member and you've seen his excellent images all over this blog. Now he's joined David Hull aka mtnrockdhh to help keep the photo pool on topic and help ease new members into the idea of Camera Tossing. The photo in this post was created by Jens and shared with the group yesterday. Very fitting for an introduction post I thought. Jens also maintains his own site/domain about camera tossing, www.cameratossing.de , where he posts some of his photos and experiments, news, yet ANOTHER Camera Tossing, HOWTO , and hosts an invited 'friend's gallery' for other camera tossers he knows well. Jens is also the instigator of a collaborative project we are introducing to the community. I'll post more on that topic very soon. ;-) --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher I guess one of the behaviors of the new genre of subscriber/reader driven content and publishing in the magazine industry is the inevitability of covering the same topic more than once. ;-) JPG Magazine , which did a story (including interviews) on Camera Tossing in it's formative youth ( Issue 6 ), has pushed another Camera Toss article amusingly titled Get Fresh With Us: "Toss Your Camera" in Issue 16 . Apparently JPG thinks seconds are fresher than firsts? This one however takes the form of a very brief photo challenge posed to it's readers/photographers online, and a selection of voted/edited picks of the result. Basically it's the magazine version of my "Pool Picks" postings except with JPG contributers being the "pool", and without really providing any instructive context, history, or origins for the readers and contributors. Ironically there was a user contributed howto article on the subject linked from the challenge pages, but all that content was left unpublished in the printed article. In it's original posted form, their challenge didn't even get the concept/definition of a Camera Toss correct. I mean really folks, it's not that complicated. A couple of senior members in our community took it upon themselves to get them to at least honor the original concept and change the challenge criteria. Viewing the incoming submissions it became clear that many of their contributors were also missing the point , so a handful of our 5,000+ community members took it upon themselves to submit high quality camera tosses in an effort to notch up the presentation of the concept. Even still, the final published selection included some that were obviously not a thrown camera . But, almost all who submitted from our community made the published version. Congrats to them and way to show solidarity, something this labor union member/advocate certainly appreciates! ;-) (Left: by David Hull , Right: by Christian Kinzler , Lower: by Marce Garal ) Please don't read this post as a criticism of the photos/photographers actually published. Most were indeed camera tosses and many quite interesting to look at. I just feel the methodology for coming up with the content in the first place left a little bit to be desired in the way of substance and professionalism. Many JPG articles were great back in the days before they restructured , and some of them continue to be quite good, but I came away from this feeling like they just needed some space filler? Which, in itself is fine, but if you wish to showcase a technique, you should either give some great instructions or display some top quality work (ideally both?). Why else would you publish it, unless, perhaps your only aim is to make your own contributors (a.k.a. paying subscribers) feel good about themselves? So three cheers to Derek and Heather for honoring our little niche of the photography universe with their original article, instructions, and interviews! (View online here ) This second time around? Not so much. As for the current editorial staff of JPG Magazine. If you wish to produce "fresh" content. Figure out a way to get your article/theme contributors to do their homework. A little tried and true journalism wouldn't hurt either. I'm sure you would have had an amazing spread if you popped into our forums and solicited the community to contribute (exactly what was done for the Issue 6 article ). How's that for "getting fresh with you" ? ;-) Maybe by fresh you didn't mean "snarky". Oh well. ;-) Links Related to this Posting: Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (and all submissions) Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (published contact-sheet) JPG Magazine Issue 16 Unpublished JPG user contributed HOWTO JPG Magazine Issue 6 Article (instructions, interviews, commentary) Camera Toss Group on Flickr --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher And now for a long... long... LONG overdue selection of photos from the Camera Toss Photo Pool over at flickr. I realize this blog has been sorely out of date, and sorely off topic, for months now... and for that I apologize. That doesn't deter the great camera tossing experimenters and the submissions to the pool just keep coming. Congratulations especially to those new members shown here.
