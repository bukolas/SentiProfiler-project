Doomsday!!! Inspired By Geetu -  Hey all...after a long time I m finding myself a lot of spare time...so much tat i Dino Wat to do..neway i was reading this post abt doomsday by geets and i felt i shud continue on it....

What exactly is this doomsday...yeah true it is in bible that apocalypse or end of the world will occur...any1 who read lost symbol will kno abt the real meaning, or the meaning perceived by dan brown....apocalypse means the end of the world true...jus tat it is the end of the world as we know it.... if u dig deeper u will understand that apocalypse refers to a major shift - a thought shift or perception shift...that we will understand the world better and see everything in new light....

again " before light, there shall be darkness"...or "before peace there shall be war"
all this doesn signify end of the world but just the shift that is going to happen.. the terrorism, the wars, the ignorance are all the darkness that comes before illumination....

Supporting this, i read sum where on Nostradamus predictions about the end of the world, that end of the world is not the end. Well, being an Indian may b i m favoring this view too much, but he did predict a major or large scale war - the war on terrorism and as it gets nastier, people around the world will lose peace of mind, and the west starts looking towards east. he had actually predicted and upswing of people going towards yoga and spirituality and come to India in search of it...and true to his words, there has been a tremendous increase in people coming towards yoga and cultural centers of India ( google n chk if u want)

for people who want more proof...okiez, chk this out... i forgot where i read it frum..sum scientific site in net oly...well they have clearly explained the phenomenon of polar shift, which many are saying will be causing the doomsday...

see, everything has polarity ryt? well so does the sun.. and earth revolves around the sun...well apart frum this the sun spins around its own axis... and it takes like so many 13000 odd years for sun to complete this spin.. as u see, the time 2012 is apparently the time this spin s going to change... as it changes the polarity of sun also changes.. ryt nw earth is facing the negative polarity of the sun.... but by 2012 it wud ve cum to the positive polarity...this precise moment wen this -ve to +ve change takes place, in between there will be a moment of imbalance or no polarity time, during wen due to lack of polarity and gravity balance b/w earth n sun there can be a possibility where earth is drawn a bit closer to the sun..if it collides wit sum other planet this tym there s a possibility of damage.. and only due to this slow polar shift does all this natural calamities occur.. these will settle down by 2012..so there is only 1/ millionth of possibility that anything bad can happen....

apart from this, the change in polar shift will actually change the world.. it is proven scientifically that everything is energy...due to the negative ions from the sun are our energies negative...wen the polar shift occurs we will be on the positive side and thus the earth will be filled with more positive energy.. and this also falls in line with the dan brown hypothesis and Nostradamus prediction..obviously Nostradamus meant all this spirituality and towards the east as a growth towards ones self or illumination..and hence we also look at the world in a new light....

n yeah, the well theorised and scientifically proven astrology will become wrong if doomsday is true...shudn all our lifelines end @ 2012 then...shudn all our horoscopes predict a disaster and end of our lyf? cummon people there s so much proof against dooms day to believe it

okay! to conclude i would like to say this...there is law of attraction..sumthin i mentioned in my previous post...yeah i m influenced by this movie "secret"..but its true.. it works..more the people believe doomsday, which they do thanks to the Internet n its hype, the more they are gonna attract it by their negative thoughts...its proven our thought have mass and they generate energy....so spread this..believe truly and have faith that 2012 is jus a change in our view of the world n not the end of the world... :) cheers
