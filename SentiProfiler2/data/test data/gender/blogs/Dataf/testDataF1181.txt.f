All of my trips to this southern Philippine city had always been for business. My first visit to Cagayan de Oro City, or CDO ,as most Filipinos refer to it, was a decade ago when I was there to hold a training workshop with the local affiliates of the organization where I used to work with. Despite the fact that I had never been to this place during that time, I traveled alone as the advance party; an irony, now that I think about it.
