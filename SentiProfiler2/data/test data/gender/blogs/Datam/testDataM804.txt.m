California Natural is one of the best dog foods available. It has the shortest ingredient list of any dog food... chicken (or lamb), rice, sunflower oil, and vitamins. Great for dogs with food allergies as it limits the number of ingredients used over all other dog foods.Transition with the chicken and rice to settle the stomach (and make back yard cleanup easier,) then alternate flavors every once in a while as the lamb and fish formulas are great for skin and coat.
