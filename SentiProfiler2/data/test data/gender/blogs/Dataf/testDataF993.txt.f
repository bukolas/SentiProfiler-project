I still miss my father. I do not remember when it was he officially left me. There is a picture in a photo album of my oldest brother, our father, and myself. We were at a park or zoo; I was at most 4. I had two braids in my hair, with pink ribbons, that matched the pink teddy bear I was holding. I was gazing past the camera with a sad/angry/angsty look on my face. My brother was eating popcorn and gazing left and not looking too happy. Our father was gazing right; he did not look happy either. Was it just a bad day the three of us were having? Probably the four of us because I assume it was our mother taking the picture. It was a picture of our family, but not of a family. Even then we were all painfully unhappy.
