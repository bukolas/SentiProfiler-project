What is the logic behind bringing Hema Malini, Smriti Irani? What is (not are) their contrinution towards developing India? Just for the sake of bringing young and women in the party executive body, i think Mr. Gadkari forgot that when it comes to election this team would not be able to stand and win seats for BJP candidates in front of much more credible names like Mr. Chidambaram, Mr. M. S. Ahluwalia, our dear Prime Minister, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Manu Singhavi. Mrs. S. Gandhi. Varun Gandhi has already shown that he has no solutions to finght poverty and upbringing the life style of people at least in areas near Pilibhit and he is now promoted...good Mr Gadkari. but as an old RSS swayam sevak, who has run Shakha for RSS in UP, i feel cheated and so does the country if BJP is a national party and promisses of a better india. I would have been more happy to see people like Modi, Raman Singh and Sivraj Singh Chauhan, Yashvant Sinha whom people can trust. Even if we want to give you opportunity to run the country in next election, we do not see credible names whom we people of india could trust the way we trust PC, MM. Rahul Gandhi has not delivered any thing till now but he shows a progressive mind and the way he is taking his career forward gives an impression that he is interested in inclusive growth despite been from the most power full family. while u are selecting people who are good at laughing, dancing, saas-bahu natak.....and no plans for a better india. U have delivered a lot for Mumbai and Maharashtra, still i can't understand that u chose this team. May be excellence and delivery were not ur primary parameters while selecting ur team and u are also convinced that PC and MM could take better care of the nation and are better people who can take India to the next level.

Gud luck to u & ur team Mr. Gadkari. i will be happy to see my self defeated for my feedback and if u win, i will go to Sidhivinayak that u could deliver for the country.
