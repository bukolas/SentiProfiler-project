So today's been somewhat of a lovely forecast outside, the suns beaming, and theres a slight wind, but comparing to the amount of snow we've gotten this year, this weathers brilliant. And yes, im stuck inside rehearsing my song for the competition which is 3 days away oh joy. Well i've had some what a productive day to say the least, i arose at 6 o clock to find the sun would like to come out at this time, and as i was staying at my dads, my sisters curtains arent at all that thick, so i was kept awake from that moment on, around 9ish i decided to drag myself out of the pit (Y). I took a lovely stroll to the shops with my father to take the only advantage i could of this weather, cus god only knows what its forecast tomorrow! I've decided to give the kitchen a new look as i seemed to drop bolognese sauce everywhere, i guess i thought i could multi-task whilst holding hot food, turns out... i can't! I also helped Jes with her little issue on blogger, so i feel accoplished that i helped someone today without even leaving the house (Y) score. So yeh, now im sat, writing out all the lyrics to the song that must be learnt to take to rehearsals later on with my mentor, and not having a printer actually sucks. And to top it all off, my college prospectus' have arrived now i need to actually choose which one i wana go to. I have no idea. Tbqh, im happy not being at college oh well :( pub tonight? much deserved i say ;D
