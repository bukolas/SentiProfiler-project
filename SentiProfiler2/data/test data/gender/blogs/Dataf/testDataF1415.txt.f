I love this show! Unfortunately, I didn't watch it when the it was on during it's regular season, because I didn't think it would be any good. I happened upon a rerun of it one day, and fell in love.It is one of the funniest shows on TV! My husband I TiVo every episode and watch them back to back! I cannot understand WHY it was canceled!? It is so entertaining and funny. I love Jason Bateman!!! And Portia De Rossi is so beautiful!
