Apparently I heard that Hamas wanted to kidnap Sheikh AbdulLatif Musa and give him up to the Egyptians.. is there any truth behind this claim? And wallah when Ismail Haniya the murtad came on the screen I wanted to vomit. And Haniya apparently called the noble brothers in Jund Ansar Allah "zionists"??? Haha, pathetic murtad sounds just like his Shi'a rawafidh counter-parts now.
