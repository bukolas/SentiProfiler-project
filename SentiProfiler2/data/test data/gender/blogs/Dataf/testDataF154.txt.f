My Aunt Mary Jo passed away earlier this afternoon. She has been battling MS for many years now and has been in a nursing home for a while. She choked on some food Monday and lost consciousness. They did CPR on her and rushed her to the hospital. She has been in ICU ever since. They decided to take her off the ventilator today and she passed within an hour. I know she is in a better, happier place now, but it just saddens me. I feel for my cousins, her sons, and her grandchildren and her husband, Uncle Jerry. May God watch over them and give them peace during this time.
I will always remember Aunt Mary Jo as a young woman who would give me her clothes, and give me special things for my birthday and Christmas. When I was growing up, we would spend most holidays with her and my cousins. She had always been a frail person, but she was so bright in my eyes! I will miss her even though I haven't seen her in years.
I miss you and love you much Aunt Mary Jo. RIP.
