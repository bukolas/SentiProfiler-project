Last night the airline, which employs a total of 13,500 cabin crew, was rescheduling some long-haul and short-haul flights which it had expected to have to cancel over the next two days of the strike, organised by Unite.

The union, which has 12,000 BA cabin crew members, hit back last night and also claimed a resounding success for its first day of industrial action and it insisted BA's contingency plans had failed.

The union said 80 per cent of its members had stood firm and that the airline had only been able to fly a third of its intended flights. It said that flight cancellations meant that 85 BA planes were parked inactively at Heathrow and a further 20 aircraft were parked at both Cardiff and Shannon airports.

Despite persistent rumours that secret talks were under way yesterday in an attempt to break the deadlock, both sides insisted that had been no fresh new negotiations and that none were planned.

The strike, the first by BA cabin crew in 13 years, went ahead after talks over pay and conditions ended in deadlock on Friday. A second wave of industrial action is scheduled for next weekend.

As the war of words escalated between the two sides yesterday, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the airline, described the strike as a "terrible day" for BA. However, the company insisted: "We continue to offer the fullest support to our cabin crew who want to work as normal."

BA predicts that 65 per cent of passengers will still be able to reach their destination during the first three-day strike, even though a total of 1,100 flights out of the 1,950 scheduled to operate are expected to be cancelled.

BA has arranged with more than 60 other airlines to take its customers on their flights during the strike.

Tony Woodley, Unite's joint leader, accused BA of wanting a "war" with the union and complained that Mr Walsh had tabled a worse offer than the one withdrawn earlier.

Mr Woodley said that he had been set "mission impossible" because of the new offer, which included a four-year pay deal the union maintained would at best freeze wages until 2014.

It can be revealed that some female cabin staff braved the threat of intimidation by union workers to go to work as normal yesterday.

Some of those who worked had received threatening emails on Friday night, one of which read: "If any of you go into work tomorrow, your life won't be worth living.''

A strikebreaker, who asked to be known only as Suzy for fear of recriminations, admitted she was terrified by the prospect of turning up for work as a volunteer.

"My stomach is churning. I don't know what I'm going to face. I just know I am going to be on board that plane, reassuring passengers, sorting out the seating, the food. Doing my job,'' she said.

"Usually workers – quite rightly – fear not doing what the boss asks. But we are just as frightened not to do what the union asks.''

Some cabin crew had to pass through picket lines to get to work, but there were no reports of violence. Tall screens were erected outside the crew report centre at Heathrow to protect volunteer staff from intimidation.

On the picket lines along the airport's Perimeter Road yesterday, union members shouted "shame on you, shame on you", at staff buses carrying those cabin crews who had decided to defy the strikes.

Some of the strikebreakers hid their identity by crouching on the floor of the buses taking them in.

There was little chaos at the major airports because most passengers had learnt in advance, by email, text or telephone, that their flights were cancelled and that they should not turn up.

Those who did were relatively relaxed. Bryan Collins, 21, a student hoping to fly from Heathrow's Terminal 5, said: "I checked this morning and they said 60 per cent of customers would be flying today so I guess we should be OK."

According to an opinion poll carried out in the days before the walkout, only one in four supports the action.

A survey by ICM, for BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, found 60 per cent believed the industrial action was "unjustified", with 25 per cent expressing support.

The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent) believed it was "unacceptable in today's society" for workers to have the right to walk out at all.

This newspaper has learnt that Unite plotted with foreign unions to target BA before its members had even voted for industrial action.

Union leaders briefed their overseas counterparts as early as November, urging them to lend support to its plans to ground BA flights.

Len McCluskey, Unite's assistant general secretary, told hundreds of strikers at a rally near Heathrow yesterday that "intransigent management" could be defeated.

"Decent men and women are terrified about speaking out about this fight for their futures for fear of reprisals," he said.

There was political in-fighting yesterday over the strike.

The Prime Minister has urged the two sides to resolve the dispute, but David Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, yesterday accused Gordon Brown of failing to act because Unite is "bankrolling" the Labour Party.

Mr Cameron said the strike threatened the very future of one of the UK's "greatest companies".

Addressing supporters in Putney, south-west London, he said: "This threatens the future of one of Britain's greatest companies along with thousands of jobs.

The Tories sent a mobile advertising truck to the area around the airport carrying a poster portraying the Prime Minister in an airline uniform with Unite logos and the slogan: "Gordon's doing sweet BA – is it because he's taken £11m of Unite's cash?"
