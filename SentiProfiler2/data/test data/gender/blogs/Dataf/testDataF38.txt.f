H1N1-Popularly known as Swine  Its weird the kind of 'Publicity' these pigs r getting these days (No Offense..Swine being piggy)..no but seriously...this disease..it has a technical name (school ka naam) H1N1 2009 and also a pet name (Ghar ka naam...bole to pyar wala) Swine Flu :-D that is funny :):) Heeheehee..my PJ sense is improving..am I proud of that or what ;-)

No but on a serious note, I wasnt too sure that the situation actually is so grave..not until I learnt that a kid from my school (Can't get over the fact that I have left it ages back now, still have the connections there!!) has caught on the virus..this is real, as are the 'precautionary advices' coming from all sources..esp from home...let me pass on a few...esp when people are so closely following the whole thing..with the PMO officially saying that they would follow the Swine Flu cases on a daily basis!

* Stay away from crowded places: Please shut the offices for sometime and give everyone paid holidays! 

*Stay away from firangs/Desi Firangs: Firangs categorising the originals and desi Firangs the 'I am an Indian with an American Passport'

*Use Tissues and NOT cotton 'Hanky':Am sure all the 'Ba's and Parvati's' are in for a shock!

A few more.. But I guess, I just love this 1:

*Cover your nose/mouth, as you sneeze/cough: Get your basic etiquettes right boss and there will be no more swine :D

Long live pigs...and Humans...in a 'virus free' world :)

P.S: Jokes apart, it is a grave situations and we must all take the precautions..

Just take care!
