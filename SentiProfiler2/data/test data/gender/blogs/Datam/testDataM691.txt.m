http://www.edutopia.org/louisville-sel-morning-meetings-video#comment-74554 I think this video is well worth your viewing whether you are an educator or parent. I am going to implement this into our routine in the morning in hopes for better cooperation between my children. Bringing movement into the routine will help start their busy day! Dear Blog....Forgive me for neglecting you for I forgot my password. It happens when you get older for we are only human you see. I will make my promise to you to update my photos and write a few words. Tonight I am afraid I'm not in the creative mood for I've blown my brain cells on my school exams. See you soon. "Desert Rose" I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of fire Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire And in the flames Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire This desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this And as she turns This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams This fire burns I realize that nothing's as it seems I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand I dream of rain I lift my gaze to empty skies above I close my eyes This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love I dream of rain I dream of gardens in the desert sand I wake in vain I dream of love as time runs through my hand Sweet desert rose Each of her veils, a secret promise This desert flower No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this Sweet desert rose This memory of Eden haunts us all This desert flower This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall -------------------------------------------------------------------- HE MEETS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND FALLS IN LOVE SHE HAS MANY PROBLEMS AND TOILS IN LIFE HE LOVES HER SO AND TRIES TO MEND THE TORN EDGES BUT HE CANNOT The Law of Karma is the Law of Cause and Effect. This concept comes to us in many forms. As you sow; so shall you reap. What goes around comes around. You get what you give. An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth In simple terms, when we chose to do or think good things, good things come back to us (good karma). When we chose to do or think bad things, bad things come back to us (bad karma). Karma is the condition created by the choice. It’s important to remember: The choices we make in every moment will determine the kind of opportunities and experiences we will have in the future. If someone treats us badly we must respond with kindness and understanding (turn the other cheek, as Jesus suggested) in order to generate good karma for the future. If we retaliate and do something unkind in return, the cycle of negative karma will continue and even escalate. “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”, as Gandhi said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A tingling in the air What is this feeling? Static electricity all about me It has a fresh air smell to it Ah...I believe I read about this This thing called Karma I am not concentrating on anyone noticing, but me... Other's and they know who they are will soon see if not already Truth is in the eye of the beholder Actions speek louder than words All these phrases written by people whom personally experience them I wonder what I will write? I'll stick to Karma comes a callin' Right now, I look upon my sleeping babes with a smile on my face They are beautiful A huge slice of my soul There is it again this tingling feeling the smell of peacefulness The knowledge of knowing my truths and convictions I know what is important Keep my course Everything that goes around comes around Those that choose to do good to better themselves for others to remove oneself from negative surroundings Well, they will find peace and happiness Those that fail to recognize their weaknesses their mistakes, Well, the cycle is a vicious one Namaste, Jen http://www.nameyourdreamassignment.com/the-ideas/Sadandbeautiful/for-our-daughters/ Please copy and paste this link to your browser...log in and vote for this wonderful photographer.

Location: Made By Hand Gallery 112 South Street Philadelphia, PA Society Hill, 100 Block of South Street Date/Time: May 8, 2009 7-9 PM Poetry, Live Music and Art He is a mirror you see in the fun house or the museum the one you stand in front of and see more than one image the first image you see is beautiful stand there for awhile and you see another distorted picture How can such a kindhearted person deceive you? What has he suffered to make this monster appear before you? How can you know? He hides behind his ghosts every second of his existence After some prodding it becomes more c l e a r pressure to be someone you are not on the inside moving from place to place when you need solid ground to grow out at sea for months on end was that man on the gurney screaming out in pain going to be okay? how did that happen? go child this is not your place to be find a hiding place escaping to my canvas...subject ANYTHING;a bird landed on the deck what is in its' mouth? is that a fish? Immersed into a place of your birth at a time of instability and confusion How old am I today? Traveling on a bus full of dreams Where is my pencil and paper? Why did we stop???? Who are these angry men in uniforms Let me go I do not belong among you... I am not of the age...see my papers Falling in daldrums of chaos and forced to fight in a conflict that I do not fully understand. Months of war and death, images like slow clicks of a camera. Images I wish can be erased from my mind Is this man I am sleeping next to breathing? Are you alive......... close my eyes I am not here..... Woke up in a military hospital with a bullet in my leg I have to go back.....what do you mean I have satisfied my duty? Returning to the states. America.....the land where they take everyting for granted. Do they even know what is going on just south of them? Fighting back my ghosts everyday....I find my true love only to be deceived.... I've given you everything.... Who is this man? What about our child? A burning passion deep inside. I have to exalt the pain, the memories Where is my brush? Where is my bottle? e m p t y Test it anyway....got a taste When did I drink that? Days merge into weeks...Weeks merge into months My trials of normality, responsibility, PuRpOsE Failing with each tilt of the head....burning in my throat and belly Can't drive anymore Can't pay my bills Who was that girl? Surrounding myself with soul sappers People like me.... looking for purpose and not finding it Drowning in sadness Spinning in this vicious circle...round round round He needs to get out of here Can't you hear him? H E L P To be continued.....
