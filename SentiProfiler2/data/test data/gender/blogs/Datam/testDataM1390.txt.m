VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. This has been a departure and therefore I am all praise for the award being bestowed on VK Murthy, a generous kind and humble human, one with whom I had the great pleasure of working in two films - Nastik and Ram Balram. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
