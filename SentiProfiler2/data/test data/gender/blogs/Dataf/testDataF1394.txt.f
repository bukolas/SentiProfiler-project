Out of all the contact lens solutions available, Clear Care by Ciba Vision does the best job at keeping my contact lenses clean and comfortable.  It's a hydrogen peroxide solution and really helps to remove any debris or deposits on my lenses.  Because my contacts are the kind that are replaced quarterly, it definitely helps keep my lenses feeling fresh even towards the time when I need to replace them.  You do have to be careful though.  It's not for rinsing your contacts and you can't put it in your eyes or you'll burn them.
