Put down your flamingo mallet for a moment, sit at your ravenlike writing desk, and work out this equation: Add one Tim Burton plus one mathematician by the name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and divide by the magical World of Disney. Multiply the result with hallucinatory visual effects, stunning design, and scene-chomping acting. Then add two Alice novels and a dozen or so Wonderland characters before subtracting a bit of the original sense of play and randomness. Then add three dimensions, divide a loaf by a knife, and carry the tea. The product? Walt Disney Pictures' Alice in Wonderland. But callooh, callay, what’s this you say? Not familiar with Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, flamingo mallets, and ravenlike writing desks? Well, National Geographic is here to help. In 1991 the magazine published a story on Dodgson, better known by his pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The author of our story informed me that her lifelong love for Dodgson’s craft and ability to play with words had motivated her to pitch the piece. She retraced the geographic world that inspired the author and his stories, viewed the original manuscript at the British Library, and met with the granddaughter of the Alice. Read Cathy Newman's story. Marvel at Sam Abell's photographs and the wonderfully illustrated story map of Wonderland by William H. Bond. Not only will you get an excellent primer for the adventures and characters you’ll see in the movie, but you’ll also learn that, in fact, 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did National Geographic in the wabe. Whatever that means. As for the movie itself, if you're anticipating a direct retelling of either Alice's Adventures in Wonderland or its follow-up, Through the Looking-Glass, you'll be disappointed (or pleased?). The familiar characters do populate the film, echoes of Dodgson’s words dance (and occasionally galumph) through Linda Woolverton’s screenplay, and John Tenniel’s illustrations are startlingly realized. But it’s not the same old Wonderland. Instead, you’ll find a sincere (though heavy-handed) effort to make sense out of a nonsense story and an attempt to create a sort of plot game that's to be won instead of a game to be played for play‘s sake. I couldn't fully connect with the film's heart for these reasons (it all made too much sense?), and my film companion went further to describe it as very well done made-for-TV movie. I understood, but I should have argued against this, as it didn't feature the greatest acting performance in the history of, like, all time EVER. (Apologies to Anne Hathaway, who portrays the White Queen. Love you, Anne. Really!) The director being Tim Burton, you’re guaranteed nothing less than a fantastic visual poke in the eyeballs. And one shouldn’t expect any less from a film that’s been given a PG rating due to a smoking caterpillar. No, really. Search the MPAA site and see for yourself. Smoking. Caterpillar. Um, YES? One ticket please! As an added bonus, check out New York Magazine's wonderfully trippy photo illustration of Alice in Wonderland's influence on culture.
