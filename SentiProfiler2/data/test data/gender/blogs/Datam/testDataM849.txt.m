When it comes to choosing diamonds, there are many aspects to consider, but most gemologists consider the cut as probably the most important feature when it comes to a gemstone's appearance.

A diamond can have perfect color and clarity but will suffer in value and appearance due to a poor cut because of its dulled appearance.

The cut determines a diamond's brilliance or how light enters the gemstone. A diamond with an ideal or excellent cut grade proportions will return the maximum amount of light to the viewer's eye, making the gem appear more brilliant and beautiful as a result.
