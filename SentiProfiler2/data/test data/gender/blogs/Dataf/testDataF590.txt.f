Right now a baby is crying. A mammy is singing. A boy is climbing a tree. Back then a bunch o’ country chil’dren with no tee vee used to play Right Now, swinging in the hammock, in the wood verandah overlooking the solitary road from country to town. Then li’l Cousin Tar would insist on telling he saga of Electric Head, a light bulb. Electric Head jump off the ceiling, walk down them steps and he is the only light bulb that ever turn into a war tank. Yawn and yawn and yawn this story would go and we useta listen with politeness ‘til somebody holla. ‘Til we get lost in a Big People maze of tasks, and panic set in. Stop, stop, play Right Now ... Right now , a spot on me bed sheet, where one pillow does lay, is soakin’ wet because I unplug the iron, leave it on the mattress, it plups down in me absence and the water that does make steam leak out, now, sheet and pillow cases is in the bathroom, I lie crossways on the bed and listen to radio. What do you want from me, curtain is coolin’ the sky-fever from me room, a light wind is hustling the cloud-herd to somewhere west, guava and fresh dirt fragrance rise up to meet me, I am pink, mellowing. Now is the time to take the time to get outta the maze, hear, see, feel, right now, for a while. Radio is boring, lemme play a li’l bit o’ Bob, Love to see when ya move in the rhythm; I love to see, when you're dancin' from within... To get awards from fellow bloggers is like getting a box of perfect chocolates - smooth and meltin' - like the best kinda flattery. But I got this secret confession...for some time, I been shaky about this blog, and when I get a’ award, I wonder if I really deserve them good things that people say. I wonder if I can live up to them praise. And that is why I procrastinate over mentioning one from fat juicy oyster , a ‘specially juicy blog by Ieishah. I does have to wait ‘til I have puh-lenty time to read, because she write about something I used to dream of doing...travel around the world, Europe, work. As she say, “have sass. will travel.” Then, recently, I receive another award, this time from Cloudcutter in Mumbai . I been reading Cloud since long-time passing. She does write about love, breakup, memories, Mumbai; she does reflect on humanity, we habits. Sometimes, she does make me think how India produce some amazing writers of books and movies. I realise then that, if two people I admire give me these delicious blog chocolates, I must, as me Auntie Baba tell me when I was a young girl, learn to accept with grace. So here me is, saying, thank you Ieishah, for this : And thank you Cloud, for this : Now, to be a copycat like Pat (that rhyme, you notice? It rhyme, I’s a poet), I gon stitch them two together and write 10 honest t’ings you mightn’t know about me: 1. I miss hiking up mountain trails. I miss the heat from chugging up, and the wind cooling down sweat. I miss that wild, free feeling, reaching the top. Mountains in Guyana is in the interior, you can’t just hike and go home at the end of the day. Plus, it expensive to get there. 2. I crave beauty like lonely people crave love. I want flowers all over the coastland, I don’t want me eyes to settle on one single plastic bottle hunkering in the long grass like some modern version of a flower. I want to see trees lining every single street, shading people, cars, donkeys and horses. Fruit trees would be good so that hungry people can pick and eat. 3. I ain’t got no friends in Guyana, everybody migrate, Cousin Yasmeen die. I must go out and look for more but where to start? 4. Me guitar is gently weepin’, beggin’ me to play it. Or maybe it secretly rejoicin’, thinkin’, phew, no more bad strummin’. 5. Favourite colour is red. If I did live in cold country, I would have a red coat. 6. If I was rich-rich, rich-rich-rich, I would wear haute couture. But normally, I wear any ol' thing. 7. If I was rich-rich, rich-rich-rich, I would sponsor plenty children, pay their school fees, buy umbrella and raincoat for them in the rainy season, but with the way El Nino behaving, umbrella and raincoat mightn’t be necessary. 8. I understand magazines like Harvard Business Review and The Economist but I can’t understand some of we newspapers…yesterday I read one sentence in a local newspaper, it was a paragraph long. 9. I don’t like hurting people but I end up doing it sometimes, without meaning to or wanting to. Then I feel bad about it forever. 10. Two Brazilian gals comin’ at eight to buy a li’l bit o’ English so I better skedaddle outta here…………………….. My thoughts is a pack of traitors. They always lead me to every confusion but the right one. Like today, for example. Today, I go out into the white sunshine, stand at the top of them back steps, to heng out some clothes to dry. Thick, sweet grass smell fill the air. I sniff, yes, it is that leaf that them Indian immigrants did bring to the Windies long ago, the weed that Rasta people think does kerry them to I-nitation , mediation on another level. Continue to heng out the clothes, can’t let that neighbour see me sniffing the air. Whip the towel like my mother say I should, snap it hard to let out the water, sniff the air, man, I am positive it is that thing , after all, that chap, what work he does do? Every now and then he does disappear off to goodness knows where. Aw, darn, I drop a skirt, oh, good, it is hanging on the pipeline just under the step. I tom-boy meself over the step rail, on to the shed, pick up the skirt, shees, that thing smell so strong, it gon make me giddy, I gon fall off this shed this good day, today... ...I wonder if I should rinse this skirt, nah man, it is clean, besides, this blazing heat gon kill every germ... ...pishewww...the pressure-cooker in the kitchen holler, oh skegs , wait a minute, I wonder if it is the lentil peas smelling so... ...heh. This confusion ain’t quarter as mix-up as the confusion about the rat poo in me tea. I gon never forget that tea though it was some years gone. How that tea taste nice. How that tea taste spicy and milky and just plain, all-over delicious, like warm, liquid bliss, from me tongue to me toes, pulling down me eyelids. I drain the cup. I look inside hoping for one last drop. At the bottom of the cup, there it is, the lump, plump and brown, thin at the two ends and thick in the middle. I cuss the sugar-factory because, as we know, that thing coulda only come from there. I cuss the people of Guyana. Because, as we know, it is only in Guyana that this can happen, thanks to people who don’t do their work with care. I cuss the guvament, never mind they don’t work the factory. I don’t know how I live without suffering from hypochondria that evening. Months pass. Memory dim. I make cardamom tea again. I bust open the pod and put the whole lump of seed in it. How that tea taste nice. How that tea taste spicy and milky and just plain, all-over delicious, like warm, liquid bliss, from me tongue to me toes, pulling down me eyelids. I drain the cup. I look inside hoping for one last drop but all I did see was déjà-vu. I cuss...oh, heh...it ain’t rat-poo, is cardamom seed. Memory return, remind me that the seed look very much like the one in that cup some months before. Maybe, my thoughts...not me...my thoughts...is a pack o’ drama queens, that's wot. Or maybe what they see is what it ain't. I need a cuppa sweet, milky cardammon chai. One day, in the not so far future, spam gon be the new dutty , stinkin’ word. Think of all the ways people does use the old four-letter word...spam gon be like that. People gon shout things like, “Spam you, man,” and the recipient of such a cuss gon launch he or she self at the abuser in rage. After the calm, the storm. And during the storm? What? What does happen during the storm? Some people does cower then suddenly they rise up and bruk through like Samson brukking up stone. Then you have some who, during the storm, don't cower at all. You stand up, move around, do what you must do. But as soon as that storm pass, you fall to the ground, dry-up like thirsty leaf. Anxiety and fear jook like sharp plimpla as you try to make your way out of them thorns. You feel tempted to hide in a cool, dark place, to curl up with your worries so you can recreate the storm, because the storm is from the past, and though the past lash you hard like devil weeing on you, it is the devil that you know; it is the devil that you’s most comfortable with. The future, because you can’t sense it, feel worse. But maybe you truly hate the ol’ bruk-a-down rubble. So you pick up your dowsing rod and you go ‘til ping, like instinct, you find something. You grab your li’l shovel, fix your feet firmly on the ground and you dig. Dig, fumble, stumble, dig. And before you know it, you’s creating a fresh new place. In other words, to be precise and concise, after I receive sad or shocking blows, I does cope. Then, when I start to recover, I does become scared and anxious. The temptation to curl up with them worries does be strong. But I know that this ain’t a flourishing thing to do, I know I should get going. I must keep going ‘til I feel like the water-melon that been in we veranda all Friday afternoon, into the night and on Saturday morning, sitting in the white basket-chair, taking sea-breeze, grinning. Heh. “Last year was a hard year for we,” cousin Yasmeen say a few Saturdays ago. Yes, it was, after she first big brother die mid-last year. I did grieve for she and she family. I did grieve especially for she mammy, my Auntie M. who does dispense tea, biscuit and jam and slather everything with humour in a breezy home, where pigeons coo in the rafters, the wind go wheeerrreee and, one time, carpenters did find baby owls in the roof. Cousin Yasmeen did proper love them baby owls, the same way she used to love them poor li'l chil'ren . “A parent should never have to bury a child,” mammy did say last year after we get the news about Auntie M. big son. Mammy been at the ol’ pink kitchen table, quoting a father in a movie. The father been sitting with one hand resting on a’ upright knee, talking to a friend. “There should be an order to things. First, the parent grows old and dies. A parent should never have to bury a child.” Last Friday, Auntie M. bury she youngest daughter, me cousin Yasmeen, me friend and laughing companion. Shucks boy, if Shamwow come here, it gon sell like rum on a Friday night after people see this Guyana-talk version . Heh. I bet it can clean up the whole o’ Georgetown city. Translated into pure, raw, unadulterated Creolese: Shucks bai, if Shamwow come hey, ee go sell like dharoo pan a Friday night after people see dis ting hey . Heh. me bet ee cyan clean up de whole ah Gargetung. To believe this theory, you got to open your mind to the possibility of other things. You can’t be like a certain person who laugh when I phone he the other night to tell he that I solve the UFO mystery. “I think UFOs is jinns,” I announce. Certain person laugh like kookaburra sitting in the ol’ gum tree, wooo hoo hahahahaHAAA. But I’s never daunted by such trifling things. I take a deep breath, haul out me soapbox, leap on to it. That night, it was a pink soapbox. I been in a mellow mood because I know that my theory gon catch on, and soon, even them Doubting Thomases gon latch on to it. “You see? You see?” I pronounce. “That is the western mind for you. Western people can believe in anything they want to believe in, even if they don’t have scientific evidence. But when it comes to Eastern beliefs, the western mind scoffs. How do you know that jinns don’t exist? If people can believe that UFOs exist, then why not jinns? They do exist. Other worlds exist. Other beings exist, we don’t see them. Jinns are made of smokeless fire, they carry on a full-scale life just like human beings, we just can’t see them. Maybe they fly in spaceships too, we just don’t know.” He mouth get li’l , as we does say when somebody can’t argue with one more word. Heh. I even get a email congratulating me. I ignore the last line as ol’ fashion jealousy. “where nasa and the usaf and the raf have failed for decades, i send you my congratulations on your solving the UFO mystery. but, it is worth keeping in mind that throughout the ages seers have not generally been well treated for revealing truths. so, if you feel you can withstand the onslaught from those with vested interests, go ahead, reveal the truth. also, prepare yourself for unexpected things like nominations for an ig-nobel prize.”
