Dinner News
We cooked our first chicken....and no I don't have any pictures. My husband said it was time to get rid of a few roosters. He has experience in this, so he just jumped right in and started with "crooked tail." I told my family not to name the chickens, but some of them ended up with names anyway. Crooked tail was one that they incubated themselves. Something must have gone wrong in the egg turning department. He was crooked, he had a crooked tail (hence the name), he crowed crooked, he walked crooked, and a crooked breast bone. My kids unfortunately went outside at a bad time. Ben came in and said "I am mad at dad!" I tried to explain to him why it was happening, he responded "I am x-ing your words mom" Good thing I am not an Internet site to be x-ed off. They were both very upset but eventually they calmed down. I was very surprised at how little meat was on this chicken, not enough for dinner. The children have refused to eat any. I never thought that raising animals would encourage my children to become vegetarians. Time will only tell. I have a chicken recipe that I am hopeful will entice them to eat chicken again.
A few nights ago over dinner my children started having a conversation about poop. Usually that kind of talk is only allowed in the bathroom at our house, but this conversation wasn't about human poop. Lucy was telling Ben about the nature walk she went on and some poop she saw. Excitedly he asked "what did it look like?" She went on to describe it and he confidently responded "it was fox poop!" My husband and I were trying to stifle our laughter long enough to ask them to change the subject. I never thought that I would hear my children having such a conversation. I am not an animal person, or a big outdoor person for that matter. But people change, learn, and grow. And these little people that have come into my life have their own interests and they love animals and the outdoors.

Eggs
How much would you say these eggs cost?



These are fresh, organic, free range eggs. And right now they cost about 6 dollars an egg. We are finally collecting eggs from our chickens. It took Jared a few days to find all of their spots, but now we are collecting between 8-10 eggs a day. I have to tell you they are pretty tasty, I don't know about $6 tasty. That price should go down as they continue to lay. It has been an adventure and will likely continue to be one! Bring on the egg recipes!
