The Boy said that was very bad of me to say that Tangobaby is dead and that I should apologize. Apparently he was not the only one who thought&nbsp; my sensationalism was naughty. I'm sorry. I'm not dead. Even this blog isn't dead. I'm going to leave it here for posterity. So, I will try this again: Hi guys! I have a new site. Come on over and see me there because I won't be over here anymore. http:julieliveshere.com Long live julie lives here . ( http://julieliveshere.com ) --- Maybe I'm being a wee bit dramatic but I hope I did grab your attention. ;-) It finally occurred to me that I needed a different place to put my stuff that's not CALIBER or i live here:SF or HAMO . Three years ago, almost by accident, I started this blog. My goodness, what a lot has happened since then. At first I wrote about movies I'd seen and then a lot about dancing tango. Blogger was very good to me, and being a Blog of Note in 2008 gave me a taste of what the wider world of blogging was all about. It inspired me to write more, share more and try to hone my skills with storytelling, idea generation and even be cognizant of good old-fashioned grammar. I got a camera in 2008 and that exploded my world wide open again. Now I could provide my own images to accompany my own stories. The avenues for creativity seemed to grow exponentially. And then the whole aspect of using the blog as an element of change and raising awareness happened in April of 2009. Learning very personal lessons about poverty, homelessness, friendship and hardship. Along the way, I lost some friends. I think I made more than I lost. Some people wanted the old tangobaby back. I couldn't summon her. She bored me. I have so many things to tell you. About the people I meet and the things I do and hopefully it's not the same ol' same ol' but stories and ideas you'll want more of. I just can't put them here anymore. It's funny how much something like a blog template or platform can be a hindrance or boost to your&nbsp; mind's inner workings. I realize now that I've outgrown Blogger and so have moved on to this new Wordpress site. It's funny, I had been so attached to my tangobaby name. I thought I wouldn't be able to be what you thought I was without that name. I agree, it's been fun. We've had a good run. I've gotten a lot of pleasure out of being tangobaby and there's a place in my heart where shiny stilletto heels and the mournful bandoneon music still lives. But I can be so much more by just being Julie. So, I hope you'll follow along. This tangobaby place has been good to me but I'm not taking it along. See you soon. http://julieliveshere.com Janika and Gabrielle (9 months) --- The two of them arrive around 1pm, just as lunch is being served. Proud mommy Janika tells everyone, she's got a tooth! Her first tooth! Women of all ages, colors, sizes crowd around mother and child. The baby, in her light purple sweatsuit, is definitely a rock star. She loves the faces surrounding her, the attention, the laughter and arms reaching out to touch her. I'm at WDDC, otherwise known as the Women's Daytime Drop-in Center, in North Berkeley. The WDDC is a non-profit program that empowers women and children to move from the streets to a home. Not all of the women here are mothers. Some are single, older women: some homeless, some getting aid for housing. All are here for lunch and companionship. The WDDC is an unusual place. It's a home, literally. Situated in a residential neighborhood, there's a kitchen with two volunteers cooking barbequed pork and yams, a living room with sofas and chairs and books, a dining area, and then several rooms devoted for client consultations and offices. The home is old, but still, it's a home. It feels comfortable and welcoming. Instantly upon my arrival, at least three people bid me hello and ask me if I need help. I can't tell if they're working there or the clientele. I'm taken around and introduced to everyone. I tell them I'm there to collect stories, to listen, to take photos. I tell them I'm with Help A Mother Out , and that we help donate diapers here. Women who don't even have kids thank me for the diapers. Everyone realizes here that any assistance and outpouring of help benefits them all. Janika especially is so grateful for the diapers. She says," I haven't had to worry about diapers at all since the baby was born. Thank you!" Some of the women are shy. They don't want to talk or have their photo taken. A couple others want me to teach them photography. We sit around the long tables while they eat their lunches and they talk about finishing school, finding new homes, getting jobs. I will be back. --- WDDC provides ongoing and intensive counseling, case management services, daily support groups, a comprehensive children's program, a variety of referral services, and a transitional housing program for for single-parent families. Due to cutbacks, WDDC has had to lay off two key employees, one a counselor for the children.&nbsp; You can read more about WDDC here and more about Help A Mother Out here. You can donate diapers online to WDDC or other Bay Area nonprofits here. You can read more about our diaper drive and awareness raising efforts here. A few of you have been kind enough to tell me about this danged pop-up window that, well, pops up , when you come to my blog. (It happens to me too. Just click cancel and it will go away. I know, it's super annoying.) Of course, I assumed that I f'ed something up, but come to find out that it's a bug with Twitter and I actually I had nothing to do with it. See, here it is . --- However, I do have to tell some of you guys that have the embedded comments on your blogs... I can't leave comments for you. I still think it's a bug that Blogger hasn't figured out yet . What it means is that if you don't link your name to your email address or have another clear way on how to send you a message, then I might not be the only person who's trying to be in touch with you and can't. Just mentioning it, especially to those of you who might wonder why you don't get comments or emails back sometimes... --- I'm hard at work on stuff for our diaper drive and planning some photo shoots for i live here:SF. We have a new group photo up on CALIBER now... take a peek!&nbsp; You can see my haircut. ;-) It's still raining but I have more Happy for you. Gregory and Xeno. I love her. (My sister made her. Good work there.) It's rainy and grim looking outside but this little face has made the sun shine already today. You can see another image here . Grandpa on his birthday, with his girlies. --- "Other things may change us, but we start and end with the family."&nbsp; ~Anthony Brandt --- Today was one of those days that I wished I had a laptop, or even a scrap of paper, for a brain dump. All those hours in the car, coming back from LA, coming back from family, from the birthday and I had so many thoughts and ideas crawling around in my head and now they've disappeared like ghosts. With my luck, they'll wake me at 3am and then I'll try to catch them, like fireflies. We had a lovely time. Grandpa was happy. I think we tuckered him out but in a good way that I know he won't mind. The girlies are beautiful and must be renamed as Little Curly Girl's hair is straighter now. Princess Chubness is getting long and lean and is not really so chubby anymore. She's walking and growing little teeth and is sporting about ten thousand long eyelashes. It's raining and I'm home. I'm going to lie in bed and listen to it rain. Nighty nite. Hi all, Just a quick hello because I'm headed down to LA to see my grandpa on what has to be the fastest planned trip I've taken yet. He turns 94 on Friday and this seems like it's a happy/sad visit, kind of a hello/happy birthday/goodbye visit. I'm going to try to focus on the happy part and not the sad part, if I can help it. I didn't want to disappear without saying howdy, and also to let you know that I am typing this post on probably one of the most ancient laptops that still works. It's my dad's, and we actually have to preheat it, like a toaster oven, for about 10 minutes before we can use it. My mom says, "Sid, go preheat the computer so Julie can send an email to her friends!" And like 10 minutes later, I can use this thing, which makes little windy whirring noises, has a plastic floppy sticking out of the drive (remember those gadgets?!) and has the screen propped up because the hinge is broken and the screen falls over if you don't hold it up with something heavy. So while I am able, here writing on this preheated computer, I wanted to tell you that the interview I'm posting tomorrow on CALIBER is really cool and you should check it out. I have some "preheated" posts scheduled there so at least there will be something pretty to look at. Okay, catch you later, peeps. See you when I get back from LaLa Land. xoxo
And here is all put together. I was happy. And loved the table settings and the flowers arrangements - green is not appreciated as a flower colour. Great wedding - the bride sang to the groom. Tired feet. Sleep now. Baking again soon. I decided to do a cutting cake for the happy couple. I had no idea how I was going to decorate the cake as the florist had told me that green cymbidiums are not in season until June. It was pure luck that these orchids were at the florist on my way home last night!!! (Side note - I have an exciting project in the works. Hopefuly it will come together!) The cutting cake it also carrot passion cake. Had to be. I wanted to make a carrot cake befitting for a passionate couple. This is soooooooooo good. I figured adding two p's - pomegranate and pistachio would up the passion in the carrot cake. I soaked the currants in orange juice. The carrot cake itself is really really (it is not your 'healthy' carrot cake). But totally fitting to have on a special occassion - like a wedding. I want to say it again. So good. I played around with my Love Chai tea. This was a mud cake. Not sure chai works as a mud cake. Filled with Dulce de leche. Yes I made the obligatory chocolate cupcakes. Flavour number two for the wedding - custard passionfruit cupcakes with white chocolate buttercream. Custard. Passionfruit. Nuff said. Ay yai yai. A couple of burnt finger tips and numerous cans of spray paint later the day my girlfriend's wedding finally happened. The theme was lime green and silver. I think I managed to coordinate everything well. The cupcake stand? Made (thanks dad!). The organza flowers? Made! Cupcake flavours? Decided! Five flavours. I don't care what anyone else says, baking in these 'cupcake' cups is hard. Not a big fan. I mean, yes they look good. But it is so much easier and I think the cupcakes cook and look so much better in the traditional paper liners. These are gluten free lemon cupcakes. Fantastic cupcake. Not so great photo or presentation. I made the peanut butter dulce de leche myself. So good. All the flavours complimented each other. Need to make this again. Next time I will get rid of the raspberry seeds so the ganache is smooth. Having said that, no one complained about having raspberry seeds in the ganache.
New York has gone through a number of transformations over the years. From the 1960s and 70s - when love and art reigned, the time of Andy Warhol and the Factory, Patti and Robert and Woodstock and 20-cent subway rides - to the 80s, when Wall Street began to fully emerge as a driving force in the world, to the 90s, when disillusionment and safe sex reigned, to the 2000s, the New York of post-Sex and the City consumerism, which saw Starbucks and a number of other annoying trendy chain spots popping up on literally every corner. Perhaps ironically, that's the New York I fell in love with back in 2004 when I first visited the city - or more accurately, I fell in love with the city when it was in this stage of evolution. Because, ultimately, there's one thing that never seems to change about the city: its energy, and the feeling it stirs in people who are drawn to it. And that energy, that feeling, is embodied in another thing about the city that never really changes: the food cart.The food cart is a magical thing. It's a cart in every sense of the word - it has wheels, it's pulled behind a vehicle, it's partially open-air - but it serves a higher purpose in providing busy New Yorkers with things that are edible. There are a number of different types of food carts in the city. The most common are the hot dog/sausage carts that heavily populate touristy areas like Rockefeller Center and Herald Square, and the gyro/shish kabob carts that tend to park in areas where young people gat
I saw Dr. R (my Lyme doctor) today. And since I haven't posted here for a while, I've got a fair amount to report. I'll start with the good news. The good news : I'm doing better. I know that every time I say this, I end up crashing. But for right now, today, I'm at about 35% energy-wise, 45% neuro-cognitive ability. This is the best I've been since getting sick in November 2007. So it appears that the Rocephin has been doing its job. And my labs are still beautiful, so my body is handling the medication load just fine. So because I'm doing well, it's time to push a little harder. Of course. So I'm going to be doing 2 grams Rocephin twice daily, four days on and three days off. I'm stopping the Plaquenil today. In two weeks, after I've adjusted to the Rocephin change, I'm stopping the Diflucan and grapefruit seed extract and going back on Flagyl (500 mg, twice daily, five days on and two days off). The doxy is staying the same (400 mg/day). I'm also going to stay on Cipro (for bartonella) for another 1.5 months. And I'm quitting the monolaurin (taken for EBV and HHV-6). And the most exciting thing of all? I am trying out private yoga classes. Regular classes are too fast-paced, but the restorative classes are too slow/easy. So I'm working one-on-one to establish poses that I can do (particulary with my PICC line in place) and remind my body what the proper alignment is said poses. I went to my first lesson yesterday, and it was a really good experience. And now the bad news . Holy morphine, Batman, I hurt like a son of a biscuit. The joint pain has receded and for the moment is only bothering me occasionally. The deep bone pain is annoying but that's about it. The back/neck pain, however, is like to drive me mad. I'm currently taking 20 mg Kadian (extended release morphine) at night, along with 1200 mg gabapentin, and it's barely touching the pain. So I'm going to go up to 1800 mg gabapentin and see if that helps. If not, I'm going to have to talk to my pain management doctor to see to do next. The pain is, naturally, interfering with sleep in a major way. At the same time, the trazodone hasn't been helping. I'm making an appointment to talk about what, if anything, I can/should do about it. I've also started acupuncture, and I'm hoping it will help. Finally, a new symptom has popped up. I've felt very short of breath on and off for a while. Sometimes during activity, sometimes when I'm lying in bed. There appears to be no pattern. So just to be on the safe side, I'm going to have a chest CT tomorrow morning to rule out a possible pulmonary embolism. With the PICC line, there's the chance of small blood clots forming at the tip of the line and breaking off and entering the lungs. This, as you might guess, is not good. Thus, the CT. There are many possible causes for shortness of breath, including thyroid and adrenal issues (and babesia and the bizarre mess that is Lyme itself). So there are many less severe possibilities than pulmonary embolism. Still, better safe than sorry and all that. I'm still wrestling with sleep. My pain management doctor has switched me from hydromorphone to oxycodone at night. I fear that the pain meds are still acting as a stimulant, though. I've also stopped taking clonazapam due to possible drug interactions. In its place, I've been prescribed a very small dose of trazodone. Trazodone is a tetracyclic antidepressant that is also used to treat insomnia. Because, apparently, drowsiness is a common side effect. I am starting the trazodone tonight. I very much hope it works, because I'm like the walking dead here. I've been able to get maybe six hours of sleep in the last two days, and I'm exhausted. Amusingly enough, I've just started the new Charlie Huston novel, Sleepless , a nice little post-apocalyptic story about a plague that prevents people from sleeping. I am aware of the irony. Thank you. Sleep. Such a simple thing. And so horribly fickle. At night, I can't sleep. I think the hydromorphone is paradoxically acting as a stimulant (Valium did the same thing when I took it a while back), keeping me awake. And the dose I'm taking isn't quite enough to dull the pain, particularly on nights like the last. My wrists, hands, shoulders, hips, and ankles all ached, and a chill current passed through my bones. I'm now taking 600mg gabapentin at night, but it's also not quite doing the trick. Adding extra clonazapam doesn't help me fall asleep any faster, though it does result in heavy sedation the following morning. A typical night/day is as follows. Go to bed at 11:00. Try to sleep. Fail. Eventually get out of bed around 2:00 and fuss around for 30 - 60&nbsp; minutes. Go back to bed. Finally fall asleep. Alarm goes off at 10:00 AM. Try to get up. Sometimes fail, sometimes make it. Am exhausted and foggy. By 4:00 PM, am fighting to stay awake. Pinching myself. Try to stay busy. Sometimes stay awake. Sometimes simply cannot and fall asleep despite myself. Wake up in one or two hours. Feel like crap. Go to bed at 11:00. Wash, rinse, repeat. I've tried getting up at 8:00 to make sure I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY tired by 11:00 so I have no choice but to fall asleep. No joy. I think that the medication combination is somehow undermining my efforts. Which poses its own problem. If I stop taking the hydromorphone entirely, or even reduce the dose, it's likely that the pain, which is already highly distracting while on narcotics, will keep me awake. Additional sleep aids (clonazapam as well as other herbal options) might knock me out, getting tossed into the river Lethe without a flotation device isn't exactly what I'm going for either. Anyway. To summarize. So. Frustrating. I'm seeing my pain management doctor on Friday, so hopefully he'll sort out the hydromorphone portion. And then I need to see Dr. M to get the clonazapam sorted. And did I mention that Dr. R prescribes the gabapentin? I wish I could get everyone in a room together and have them actually collaborate on One Treatment Plan, with each other's immediate opinions and feedback. I also wish I had a unicorn. Yesterday I had a lymphatic drainage massage, then I saw Rose for a shamanic/Reiki healing session. And then I had the first dose in this round of IV glutathione. During my session with Rose, there was a lot of energetic clearing work that went on. I could tell the story, but it just wouldn't have the same resonance anymore, which I suppose is kind of the point. In any case, there was all sorts of physical, emotional, mental, spiritual clearing. Sweeping out the cobwebs. By the time I got into bed, I was ready for sleep. And I got sleep. Good sleep, too. And a lot of it. My alarm went off at 10:00 AM. I turned it off and resolved to get up. Then it was noon. OK, I thought, it's really time to get up. So I get out of bed. At 2:00 PM. I had a snack, took my meds, and tried to stay awake. By 4:30, I was back in bed and fast asleep. I got up again at 6:30. So when Nick came home from work at 7:00, I'd been awake for a grand total of three hours. So, I've had two days of little but self-care. Clearly it was needed, and I'm glad I'm starting to listen to my body. As you may remember, I had a wee bit of difficulty on Tindamax. After my second attempt to start it, on New Year's Day, I collapsed in a puddle of confused neurotransmitters. I thought that maybe--just maybe--this could be the sign of a very powerful die-off reaction (cysts in the brain and all), but I wasn't sure. Given my physical pain level at the time, I decided to stop the Tindamax again, wait until I saw my pain management doctor to get the pain under control, and then see what my LLMD had to say about my reaction to Tindamax. (I was planning to see both doctors within a week of each other anyway.) I saw my LLMD on Friday. I told him how I reacted to the Tindamax--which was entirely different than I'd reacted to Flagyl, a similar drug--and he suggested that it's highly likely that Tindamax and I are just not compatible. That my extreme emotional walloping was the result of a nasty drug side effect and not a herx (die-off reaction). So no more Tindamax for me. Done. Since Tindamax was my cyst-killing agent, we needed to plug that gap in my medication regimen. Plaquenil may or may not kill cysts, depending on whose research you read. So I might be covered there. But we're adding the Diflucan back in (there were signs that yeast might be returning anyway), and I'm also starting grapefruit seed extract, which is supposed to help with cyst-killing. I also asked Dr. R to prescribe another round of IV glutathione, as it seemed to really help last time. I think that my recent lab work is also testament to the glutathione and other liver support I'm doing. I have the lab results of someone who isn't taking any antibiotics, not those of someone on an extended period of of multiple antibiotics. So that is very, very good. Since it's been a while, we also checked my vitamin B12, vitamin D, and ferritin (iron storage) levels. My B12 was over 2000, while "normal" is between 211 - 911 pg/mL. So suck it, vegan-haters, all claiming that I can't get my B12. Suck. It. My vitamin D just barely above the minimum of the normal range. Not terribly shocking, since it's a Seattle winter and I've been avoiding too much sun exposure due to the doxycycline. Still, it's a clue that I might want to make sure I continue to supplement, perhaps even increasing from 1000 IU to 2000 IU daily. It is, after all, a dark and cloudy winter in the Emerald City. Finally, my ferritin level is right in the middle of the normal range for a woman. And I haven't been supplementing with iron for ages--months or maybe even a year. So, again, suck it, vegan-haters. I get my iron. Suck. It. Every happy lab result is like a little victory. P.S. Points to those who get the song reference in my post title. I'm the white rabbit. P.P.S. I still fondly remember the TKK concert at which I was kicked in the face, resulting in the loss of one of the lenses in my glasses. Luckily, my brother was with me and could drive us home. Ah, memories. Hydromorphone. Dilaudid, if you want to get formal. We're figuring out how we feel about each other. What direction is this relationship going? Is this something that's going to work? Because at first, darling D, you just weren't doing enough for me. I did exactly what I was supposed to do, but your 2 mg pill was just not meeting my needs. I'd stay up late into the night, wishing you could do for me what you'd promised. So we've moved to the 4 mg pill level. I let you get to second base with me in the backseat of the car. I slept too deeply afterward, but that could have been the clonazapam talking. I woke up at 4 AM and you were gone. I ached for you. Literally, darling. My hips, legs, ankles...I was on fire for you, burning a cold electrical passion in the very marrow of my bones! I got out of bed to look for you, and you were there for me. Another 4 mg and we snuggled back to sleep. Last Friday I saw my pain management doctor. The methadone hives had returned by that point, so it was obvious that I had to switch medications. He prescribed 2 mg hydromorphone (common brand name: Dilaudid), after my insurance refused to cover his first choice, oxymorphone, or Opana; Opana, despite being developed around 1914 and introduced to the U.S. in 1959, is still only available as a brand name drug. So it's expensive. Like, ridiculously expensive. Anyway, now I'm taking hydromorphone. It's not working. At least, it's not working at my current allowed dose. Which is why I'm awake and blogging at 1:00 AM. Tomorrow I'm going to call the pain management doctor and ask what I should do. It's possible that I need a larger dose, or that this medication just isn't right for me. The joint and bone pain continues unabated. The bone pain isn't surprising, but I'd always been thankful that of all the crap I've got to deal with, at least I don't have the classic Lyme joint pain. It's mostly in my lower body--hips, knees, ankles, and all the tiny little joints in my feet. The pain is causing me to make my Ugly Sick Pain Face. I grind my teeth and clench my jaw and scowl without realizing it. Until I look in the mirror. And then I'm all, "Damn! Where did that scary, ugly chick come from?" I've told Nick that if the most severe of my Ugly Sick Pain Face Lines remain after I get well, I am seriously going to consider plastic surgery to smooth out my face just a little. Or else I will forever look like I'm in a very bad mood. And once we're not spending gazillions of dollars on Lyme treatment every month, we'll have the disposable income for a little beauty restoration. Right? Of course, it's highly likely that the Ugly Sick Pain Face Lines will fade on their own once I'm no longer making the Ugly Sick Pain Face all the time. On my good days, and particularly during my rare good weeks, the lines do fade and I suddenly look my age again. On Saturday morning, I decided that I had to take a vacation from Sucktown, and I went back on the methadone. Allergies be damned. I couldn't deal with one more sleepless night Saturday and Sunday night were blissful. I slept . For hours and hours and hours. And then some more. The deep bone pain was gone and I could catch up on all the rest I'd been missing. Unfortunately, the itching has returned. Still no hives, but it's looking like confirmation that I'm slightly allergic to methadone. But I don't care. I'm going to keep using it until I see my pain management doctor on Friday. But wait! If I'm all happy and sleeping well and life is roses, why am I blogging at 3:00 AM? Nightmares. Unrelenting nightmares. After my first hour or so of sleep, I got up and had a tiny bit of chocolate (always good for you). OK. Back to bed. More nightmares. I try to clear the energy in the room. But I keep falling back asleep and into the nightmares. So I'm blogging, hoping my brain will reboot and I can get some more of that delicious sleep. I plan to spend a little time clearing out my energy field, as well as the bedroom's. Make sure I'm properly grounded and centered before I get back into bed. Update: Finally got to sleep around 5:00 AM. Slept until 2:45 PM. Was nauseated and dizzy all day. Whee!
Betty and Don and Roger and Joan dolls will launch in July to help promote the start of Season 4.Mattel will issue 7000-10,000 copies of each doll but you won't find them in toy stores, only in specialty stores and two websites: amctv.com and barbiecollector.com.Of course, dolls come with period accessories like fedoras, pearls and padded bras. But no cigarettes, ashtrays or cocktail shakers. Ironic that Betty can smoke and drink while she's pregnant but not while she's Barbie.  Since the Old Spice commercial launched on the Superbowl, "I'm on a horse" has entered pop lexicon. It's been a frequent retweet on twitter where the guy on the horse, of course, has his own account. It's engendered countless blog posts and news nods and chatter on Facebook and even interviews with its creators from Wieden and Kennedy who explain how the spot was a accomplished in a single, incredible shot. (57 takes)Ad phrases that become catch phrases are nothing new, but what is new is that the commercials that spawn them are now the beginning, not the end of consumer engagement. When media flights for "spicy meatball" and "where's the beef?" ended,  so did consumer involvement with content. But now the impact of brand messaging only begins with traditional ad buys, if content is compelling enough to inspire people to share it. The Old Spice spot has already exceeded 7 million views on youtube, numbers achieved because the spot went to social networks in conjunction with (not instead of) conventi
You always think I can do that, the reality is a million miles away. Well it certainly is for me anyway. Especially when he dropped that pole even lower.No I didn't publicly humiliate myself by trying. I left that to a tourist egged on by his friends. I'd never heard of this sport until last weekend, even though it has been around since 1891. As part of the festivities of the East End festival this exciting version known as hardcourt cycle polo was played at Spitalfields Market.There are three core rules of play:In the case of a 'foot down' or 'dab' (touching the ground with ones foot) the player must "tap out" by riding to mid-court and hitting a designated area with their mallet. There is usually a tap-out located on either side of the court.In order to score, the offensive player must hit the ball across the goal line using the narrow end of the mallet - this is called a "shot" or "hit" - hitting the ball across the goal line with the wide end of the mallet is called a "shuffle".When your team scores a goal, you wait back in your end for the other team (player or ball, whichever comes first) to cross half before engaging in play again.There are three contact rules: body on body, bike on bike and mallet on mallet.An etiquette rule is that you play others as hard as they play you
Last Friday I was feeling brave. I decide I am going to march into Sonia Rykiel Saint-Germain and ask politely if I can take a few discrete photos for PB. After all I attended the show bla bla bla... They say I must speak to Presse upstairs... Up I go to the press office and wait a little bit tenuously, biting nails furiously, praying, hoping... Out comes Claire (who invited me to the show), Edouard (Communications) AND Lola ( Nathalie Rykiel's daughter!!!). They say to me, "We love your blog" (!!!) "Of course you can take pictures." I am melting... The SR store is spacious Every inch packed with divine SR items for every moment of the day. Lola tells me the windows always have books on display... Her grandmere, Sonia Rykiel has always gotten inspiration and ideas from books, so they are an important part of the store concept - here the mannikin wears a book on her head... Even the sweater shelves are like bookshelves! Of course there are the signature Sonia stripes... miam The skylight reflects those graphic stripes... A vendeuse pulls out a drawer for a customer full of Sonia treasures... miam miam I heart these red lips. Sonia's accessories have always been the wittiest and the best IMHO... I long to step into this snow globe and stay indefinitely... Nathalie Rykiel, Sonia's daughter, created her first collection, Sonia Rykiel Enfant while pregnant. Really they are a team: Sonia + Nathalie + Lola - 3 generations of Rykiel women, creating clothes for women by women. Nathalie is celebrating the birth of her first book, " Tu Seras Une Femme, Ma Fille " I draw Lola Rykiel and this is Max , the bear she gave me... Max will only drink chocolat chaud at cafe Le Select . He is quite particular like any French bear. Please visit Max at the new Sonia Blog . BONJOUR SONIA RYKIEL SAINT-GERMAIN! et merci!!!

When I left the Yves Saint Laurent exhibit at the Petit Palais on Friday morning, this was the line waiting. Get your ticket at FNAC please . I walzed in with no hindrance. Assuming you're planning to be in Paris... This bow affair is one of YSL's early works at his first coutourier, Dior. Red lips on black velvet and a definite charmer... YSL's use of and influence by artworks is evident throughout the exhibit - Here Mondrian and Matisse ... The strong exotique influence of the Near East and Morocco, his home away from Paris is another strong theme... Some Braque-influenced gowns... There's almost too much to take in here- YSL was such an innovator and constantly referencing all sorts of sources... There's a room of just fabric swatches - YSL was a great colorist. Pink was his favorite color. There are 15 rooms to view and near the end this grand collection of brilliantly colored evening gowns. In the same room - it's worth getting the audio tape, though it could take a week to get through it.. The back wall of this large room is painted black and completely covered with YSL's "Le Smoking" suits . The pencil sketches always catch my eyes - here The Trench. Plus I love the antics of his cartoon character, Lulu... Word out is that YSL could be quite cranky and unreasonable at times. Perhaps too much drink, drugs can be held accountable... There's a new book out on this aspect of his personality, Mauvais Garcon /Naughty Boy. Yet this picture in a book at Galerie Laffayette of YSL with all of his French Bull Terriers won me over completely - he is so obviously gaga over his doggies. Who do you think is the boss in this relationship? Over the years, he owned an endless string of French Bulldogs, each Brindle pied, each with the same name, Moujik . Upon the death of each dog, he’d immediately acquire another, and name it Moujik. What can one say? BONJOUR YSL! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com. Please contact carol(dot)gillott(at)verizon(dot)net. I am staying with a French girl in Paris - we met two years ago in New York . French Girl mysteriously writes me in New York: Dear Macaron girl, Oh by the way, when you are here, we will do the American way (??): you do as if you were at your home, you open the fridge, put tons of macarons, cook in the kitchen, use everything you want.......so funny!!!! When American girl arrives Sunday, French girl announces friends are coming at noon for lunch in Chinatown. 12:06: American girl, who is rather hungry from long plane trip says, where are your friends? 1:06: American girl says, Ahem...do you think we should call your friends? 1:30: American girl is pacing the room, thinking of looking in the fridge.. At 2ish friends arrive - This is The French way I'm informed. American girl is leaving for fancy French fashion show... French girl politely asks: are you taking that bag with you? The American Way: You are not leaving the house with that horrible thing . French Girl has a snack of chips. She eats TWO chips, with a naughty smile and puts the bag away. The American way: devour the entire bag at one go. French Girl's petit dej' in the morning- two slices of toast heavily slathered with butter and some tea. How French Girl can fit into this complicated, witty skirt, that only a French girl could wear, is beyond me? First thing in the morning (5am) I am at the computer, headphones on, working on my PB post, humming merrily away to Whatchasay . French Girl is suddenly standing in the doorway in her PJs. Your singing is waking me up! Eeep. French Girl does her blog posts in the evening like any sane person bien sur . French Girl is off to Carnaval in Limoux Thursday night, so she warns, French people sleep in on the weekends. No loud singing svp On Thursday evening I go to my macaron class at the Ritz . I see deux mecs /2 guys standing outside in chefs jackets yacking away in English. I ask them, How do I find the class? They respond The French way , Bonjour, bonjour , and then lead me down into the inner sactum of the Ritz. At reception two French women look at my facture and remark/giggle, but your class is next week! Eeep...I did not read the fine print :( I remember author Elizabeth Bard... Is doing a reading/book signing of Lunch in Paris at W .H.Smith just up the street on rue Cambon and run to catch it. Elizabeth has the most delightful and endearing way of recounting her experiences of The French Way - she met a French guy in Paris and married him. Elizabeth's French mother-in-law is eternally thin and never snacks between meals. At the beach she only brings a liter of water. Ce Ça! Elizabeth describes her French husband at breakfast- he leisurely makes his coffee, sits down, reads his paper perhaps, surrounded by chaos, yet ignoring it - definitely The French way . Do stop by Elizabeth's blog - I know you'll enjoy it as well as her book . Wednesday night, French Girl says, OK I am going away tomorrow. So tonight we eat The French way . After, you can do what you want . She takes away my soup pot, puts the computer on a chair, lays down a fine linen tablecloth and silverware. My soup is served in a proper bowl. Then she sits down and joins me for dinner The French way and heaves a great sigh of relief. French Girl's parting words as she takes off for the Limoux carnival, Don't burn down the house . This is a universal sentiment... So whatchasay? Have you experienced The French Way ? :) BONJOUR THE FRENCH WAY! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com.

Note the visiting fashionistas in Galignani have the latest edition... Entre! There are many levels rather than floors inside LV - it seems like you can go on forever. Note the classic Vuitton suitcases hanging on the walls... Even a fashion bookshop! All of the interior design is sleek and elegant... Hatless chic Parisiens browse. I am now hatless too by the way... Marc Jacobs designs accessories, everything for LV since 1997 and is completely adored by Parisiens . Some Americans are loved in Paris...go figure The BIG shoes here are covered with black roses... A red shiny trench has toil de Jouy cuffs and lining! How clever you are Marc. This looks to me like a very chic maids uniform non ? A boudoir maids outfit..? A mini bag even we may be able to afford. I forget the prix ... If you are a VIP at LV, waiting for your girlfriend to finish in the dressing rooms, they serve you an elegant demi-tasse of espresso. If you are me you go ( finally ) up the street to McDo's cafe to try the macarons. I gotta admit these are not bad, except for the caramel . And at McDo's you can hand them a 50 euro note for 6 euro bill and no one raises a fuss. A BIG plus in Paris. BONJOUR LOUIS VUITON!

It's the place to find the latest books on art and fashion... Right now the windows are full of YSL ... Yves Saint Laurent's first major retrospective opens tomorrow at the Petit Palais . I got my ticket at FNAC for Friday morning. Yay Inside Galignani the fashionistas are browsing, since the shows are still on... I spot Bill Cunningham from the NYTimes again ... They always have a slew of books on Coco . Remember when I wrote about The Gospel According to Chanel ? Wouldn't is be swell to have your book in a chic shop in Paris? More YSL mostly in French... A plethora of fashion books... No wonder Bill is here... This book caught my eye, My Mother's Clothes by photographer Jeanette Montgomery Barron... A lovely memoir/scrapbook of her late mother's various stylish outfits and the stories they recall. Poignant. A key thing to remember about Librairie Galignani is... It's exactly nextdoor to Angelina at 224 rue de Rivoli. So easy to pop in for a chocolat chaud post-browsing non ? BON APPETITE!

It's one of my observations that Parisien women don't wear hats no matter how frigid the weather (Feels like: 16°F) Warm puffy coat, snazzy studded bag... Cosy furry boots... But hatless... Giant posters of Kate Moss with supremely messy bedhead, advertising her new bag line for Longchamps is not helping the situation at all. Even my pictures have a blue cast, it's that freezing cold... Big puffy coat up over the ears - hair sticking out exposed to the elements. Lots of exposed ponytails in Paris... Another...here both mother and child are hatless. Men too. Me, I am wearing a hat. It's glued to my head. I'm American so I can get away with murder... Meanwhile the shop windows are full of hats like these big blue cabbage roses on top of the manequins... At Sonia Rykiel's - a simple Kelley green plastic disk is popped on top... More delicious disks at Gerard Mulot - tarte citron and tarte l'orange . Why not add a touch of red to your bedhead? Or go for the Carmen Miranda effect - totally fruity. BONJOUR HATLESS PARISIENS! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com. Please contact carol(dot)gillott(at)verizon(dot)net. Dessert first! I made it to Sonia Rykiel's show! Yay But to get there - a lot of waiting in the frigid cold. Paris cold is like no other. It says 21 degrees/feels like 18. It should say feels like minus 18 . The Seine wind chill blows right through you. The fashionistas couldn't give a %$#@ Bonjour Bonjour Style reporter man-on-the street and all-in-blue, Bill Cunningham from the Sunday Times is dressed appropriately. We both scurry to grab a pic of barely dressed all-in-blue Lilly Allen Inside I squeeze onto the Photog's podium. I have no actual ticket or seat # but I'd rather stand here than sit in the gigantic stadium of the Halle Freyssinet ... The first model prances down the catwalk. A giant pompom on her head... I love this intarsia sweater with swallows flying... Fab flaming red long trench... Sonia's stripes - a must! Sky-high shoes with fur - a must! Fluid, drapie..what can you say? Tres feminine as always is Sonia . The grand finale of high-fiving smiling girls - so Sonia ... I follow these Sonia lovers into the mist at the end of the catwalk, thinking they are headed for the exit... Party time back stage... And another chance to admire while drinking champers... The model's look sheets... Makeup look photos for at least 60 girls... Back to realite and the next show... What it take to get "the Look" What it takes to get me back to feeling warm again - a cup of chocolat chaud at the cafe Deux Magots . Hope you had fun! Watch the show rehearsal!! This feed contains copyrighted photos and text from http://www.parisbreakfast.com. Please contact carol(dot)gillott(at)verizon(dot)net. Yep, it's true! Paris Breakfast got an invite to attend Sonia Rykiel's show this Sunday . We were planing to depart next Sunday...ahem There's been some very crazy scurrying around here... We (my camera and I) took this picture of Sonia's St. Germain vitrine last October... Are these shoes not to die for? Would that we had these to wear Sunday's show? Choices, choices... Granted we will not be wearing Tavi 's hat from the Dior show. We won't be in the front row either :) Big merci Sonia ! So kind of you to let me come. Merci to SADE for inspiring me to rewrite your lyrics in Soldiers of Sonia Love . You can listen to SADE speak here . Merci Metro horoscope yesterday.

I've finally begun a new blog, in keeping with the fact that I'm not in Poland anymore. So please visit The Wendy Lady at your earliest convenience. Polish customer service (or the lack thereof) The homeless guy who asked if he could take our unused ramekins full of garlic & tomato sauce at a restaurant last night Buses & trams that never show up, or randomly take an alternate route The view from my apartment The homeless guys who lived in my stairwell The nicest landlord in the world (even though he asked me to lie!) Electric lawn mowers And, of course, all the people I met and/or worked with, including students, teachers, and administrators. As a closing thought, I'd like to share some sentences that have amused me over the past 4 years. These are all actual samples of students' writing, and they all helped to make my job much more entertaining. I felt shiver on my spinach. I think that supermarkets are great creatures. Another thing is the possibility to wear light clothes, uncovered shoulders and half-naked paunches, which alure the man-kind. People want to read books, sink into their comfortable armchairs and sneeze. History wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to learn it. Right now we have two dogs at home (a sheepdog and a puddle). My heartiest thanks to everyone in Poland who has made me feel at home here. I never would have made it through 4 years without your help! Why yes, I am procrastinating, why do you ask? The packing & shipment of my belongings has run into a slight snag, but I'm confident (read: stressed out of my mind) it will all work out fine, and my books will eventually land somewhere near Seattle. So while I slowly come to the realization that the packing gnomes aren't going to appear & take care of things for me, I discovered a quiz for all the grammar freaks out there. And that definitely includes me. Which Punctuation Mark Are You? Enjoy, and if you happen to see the gnomes, please send them my way! "That's all your house is: a place to keep your stuff. If you didn't have so much stuff, you wouldn't need a house. You could just walk around all the time." -George Carlin I'm attempting to get rid of a considerable number of my possessions, rather than dragging them all back to Seattle with me. It's actually been easier than I expected - the more times I move, the better I am at determining what I really need, and what I only thought I needed when I bought it. There's a lot that falls into that second category. So if you're in the Poznan area, and you're feeling a need for some random kitchen items, come on by and help yourself to my stuff. I ordered a salad and a side of garlic bread at a restaurant this afternoon. I had carefully perused the menu, which said absolutely nothing about any bread being served with the salad, which is why I ordered bread to go with it. Imagine my surprise when the waitress brought me my garlic bread, my salad, and the garlic bread which came with the salad. This is actually the second time this has happened to me here. (Here as in Poland, it was a different restaurant last time.) What confuses me is why the waitress didn't tell me that bread came with the salad. Did she really think I wanted to consume half a loaf of bread with my salad? Did it not occur to her that I may not know bread was automatically included with the salad, which is why I ordered some? The menu simply lists what's in the salad, with no mention of bread. I looked. Carefully. Because this had happened to me before. I was a waitress in one of my many former occupations. If someone had ordered something which was already included with their meal, I would have told them. And I've had a waitress tell me here, too - when I asked for rice with my sweet &amp; sour chicken, I was told it was always served with rice. Apparently, it's just salads. That'll teach me to ask more questions when I order. Or to try a different restaurant. I bought a new pair of sandals a couple weeks ago, thereby guaranteeing that it would rain for the next 3 days. But when I finally wore them, it turned out they weren't the same. My toes poked out noticeably more on the left than on the right. When I bought them, one of the things I understood the sales clerk to say was that they were guaranteed for 2 years. So I decided to take them back and exchange them for 2 matching sandals. I had the receipt, I'd only worn them twice, it should be easy. Oh wait, this is Poland. I took the shoes back to the shop and showed them to the sales clerk. She agreed that there was something wrong, then showed them to her colleague, who concurred. Bring on the paperwork. I gave her my receipt, she filled out the form. She asked me whether I wanted a new pair or a refund, to which I replied that I'd like to get a new pair - I really like these sandals! I signed the form. I was then told to return in 2 weeks for the decision. 2 weeks? The decision? You mean you can't decide right now? You have to think about it? In fact, the decision is likely to be made in some corporate office, far from the shop where I spent my money for a pair of sandals which turned out to be improperly made. I now have no sandals, no refund, no decision - but I have a piece of paper and a date to discover if they'll replace my lovely new sandals. I've been discovered. As those of you who read the comments already know, one of my students has found my blog. Which likely means that ALL of my students have found my blog. Ever since I saw the comment, I've been racking my brains, trying to remember if there's anything on here I might not want students to know about me. I do kind of try to keep my personal life somewhat separate from my teaching life. But I also try not to post anything I don't want my parents to know about - yes Dad, that means you, but it's your own fault for freaking out when I happened to mention I was on antibiotics. I think I'm pretty safe. I do tend to be aware of the fact that my words can go anywhere from here. Blogging isn't private by any means. And even if I did post something I'd rather not announce to my students, it's a little late now. So to any of my students who happen by, I say, "Welcome." Please take note of the use of punctuation in the previous sentence. Unless you're in a British English group, in which case I should say, "Welcome". That just looks weird. This has been in the planning stages for a while, and it's time to let everyone in on it - I'm moving back to the States for a while. In many ways, this is an odd decision. I'm leading a fairly comfortable life here. I have job security, the nicest landlord I've ever had, and I always said I wouldn't live in the U.S. as long as W was still in office. However, I've been here for 4 years now. I haven't seen most of my family in 2 years. And I miss the comfort level that comes with living in your home culture. So, I'll be arriving in Seattle at the beginning of July. My immediate plans are to stay 1-2 years, and then very probably come back to Poland. Or maybe move to another country. Or maybe stay in Seattle longer. Or...some other option as yet unconsidered. Keep in mind, I came to Poland in 2003 with the intention of staying for 1 year. I'm not terribly good at long-term plans. My current, immediate plan is to find a teaching job in the greater Seattle area, ideally one that won't require me to acquire any additional qualifications. Do think of me if you happen to be a member of any hiring committees which are seeking an experienced, well-traveled, only slightly jaded ESL instructor.
Tonight at the Metro Atlanta Beekeepers' meeting, Cindy Bee, Master Beekeeper who has been working with bees since she was a child, presented a program on how to catch swarms.First she addressed the reason that bees swarm.  She suggested that we think of the hive as an entity and that when a swarm happens, it is the hive reproducing itself.  In other words, the swarm is the hive's "baby."  Bees swarm in springtime because the arrival of pollen stimulates the queen to lay her eggs.  The hive begins to build up the numbers of bees and gets overcrowded.The workers, not the queen, make the decision to swarm.  First they make a replacement queen by choosing several eggs and creating queen cells (feeding the new larvae only royal jelly).  Then they make the old queen run round and round the hive to slim her down.  Finally they run her out the front door.  When she flies away, anywhere from 20 - 80% of the bees in the hive follow her.  This event  = a swarm.Meanwhile back at the original hive, the queen cell hatches and the new queen emerges.  That queen kills any queens still inside their queen cells and begins the process of getting ready for her mating flight.  Swarming delays and impacts honey production because the hive is diminished in numbers and the queen has a while before she is mated and laying so there is a disruption in the hive build-up.The swarm that left the hive hangs wherever the queen landed while the workers fly out to possible sites for new hives.
big piles of each color right on the carpet, and even made a mixing pile of purple. Little Picasso had made such a mess!I grabbed towels, a bucket of water and every bottle of stain remover I could find, and immediately went to scrubbing like a mad woman. All the while yelling "Are you watching him?! Do NOT let him move!!"After lots of scrubbing, and seeing how much progress I had made, I started to breath again.Taking a deep breath, I began to laugh... I still have paint stains on the floor. Jake is sitting in the tub covered in paint.I ran out of stain remover and need to go to the store.The kids haven't had lunch yet.AND, Kailey has to be at the orthodontist in 35 Minutes!!Everything after that was a complete blurr. Somehow I got it all done and made it to her appointment, and On Time at that!At some point in between all the madness, I did take a few seconds to grab my camera.They were taken at the time where I was breathing, so they are blurry and most of the paint was cleaned up. On Jake too! At least I captured something, right? Can you believe this little monster?All I know is; Thank God for Oxi Clean, and the fact it was kids paint! Every year we go All out for the fourth. We drive up to the next state and buy tons of illegal fireworks. I say "we", what I really mean is Jason. Here's how it really works. He begs to go stop at the fireworks store. Swears we won't buy much. Then I follow him around the store as he snatches and grabs, like a kid in a candy store.
Be my Valentine Lacey Heart I think this is really pretty. I found it here and there is a free chart! I was browsing the web and came across this site with some nice cross stitch patterns to download for free. You can find the list of free charts here: http://shopping.originpublishing.com/charts_category.asp?category=5 This is just one of the cute ones you could do up as a nice Christmas card. And here is the link: http://shopping.originpublishing.com/chart.asp?id=974&amp;category=5 I came across some quick little Easter free pattern kits at Hobby Loco. Here is a preview of the pretty egg plus there are two bunnies and a chick there. Go Here to see these and download. This pair of hearts that would be a quick addition for Valentines Day! Find the free download pattern HERE at free-cross-stitch-pattern.com This cute 50's type silhouette image really caught my eye. It uses 14 count aida cloth and three colors of DMC thread. If I were stitching it I would probably not do the white stitches that are outside the design. Since it is done on white cloth, I would be lazy and skip this step. :-) Either way, 2 or 3 colors, it would be so easy to stitch up for Valentines Day ! You can find this design and pdf download HERE at Free Cross Stitch Pattern. Com. It will be in the romance category and it is called romantic dinner. I just checked Tereena Clarke's Artecy Cross Stitch and she has a beautiful free download up for grabs. I am partial to birds so naturally I really like this one, but I think you will too! It makes me want to get back to stitching! See it HERE. She also has a cute Santa so you have a whole year to do that one. Have fun. Sometimes it is difficult to take a good snapshot of something in a photo frame.&nbsp; I snapped this view of a project that I completed way back when I was learning to cross stitch.&nbsp; It is not the first, because as I said earlier on the blog that the barns were my first stitched projects.&nbsp; This may be my second one, I don't remember for sure but it is somewhere in there as one of my first. I found this chart while browsing through the magazine Classic Stitches web site. There are several pretty free charts there to download. They will be within the stitching zone drop down button across the top of the page. I found this one listed in the flowers-fruit category and thought it was pretty enough to share. The design is worked throughout in cross stitch and back stitch.
-I recently learned that Caesar dressing has anchovies and raw egg yolk in it and that salmonella can be carried on the shell of an egg, not inside. So if you wash an egg with antibacterial soap before cracking it, you lower your chances of getting salmon
Just a quick reminder that tomorrow night Steph and I will be getting together with a lovely bunch of creatives at the Brisbane ABCD meetup ! Don't forget to RSVP if you haven't done so already! The goodie bags are already looking promising with these exclusive preview passes to the new film MICMACS by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amélie) ~ there is one double-pass for each goodie bag, kindly donated by Hopscotch Films ! Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of cinema’s most inventive and inspired talents and the creator of Amelie, Delicatessen and A Very Long Engagement. In his new film MICMACS, a man and his friends come up with an intricate and original plan to destroy two big weapons manufacturers, and in the process find answers to such questions as: Are zebras white with black stripes or black with white stripes? Can you get drunk from eating waffles? What's the human cannonball world record? Can a woman fit inside a refrigerator? Is it better to live with a bullet lodged in your brain, or have it removed? :: Read more about the ABCD meetups here :: I have been having such a great time playing along with Kirsty's Creative Space on Thursday over at Kootoyoo , that I thought I'd join in with another fun play-along hosted by the lovely Sophie from Her Library Adventures . Sundays are dedicated to Flea Market Finds... I've started experimenting with Christmas ornaments (sneak peek shown in my previous post here ) ~ and I wanted to find some new lace doilies that would suit the Christmas feeling, to give these ornaments their own unique patterns rather than repeating some of my existing range. I was hoping to find some patterns that looked like stars/snowflakes, and I could not have been more excited to find a few excellent doilies at my local St Vinnies! Below are some that made the cut in the end ~ not all doilies are suitable for pressing into the clay, but I'm very pleased with these ones I found! The one above would have to be my favourite ~ it is exactly what I was hoping to find! I think it is perfect for the baubles and snowflakes. I'll have to take good care of this one as it is very delicate... This one has a perfect star-like pattern for the ornaments. This one is not very suitable for clay-impressions, it doesn't leave a nice clean pattern ~ but I still loved it and thought it would make a nice display for markets. The one underneath is a cotton fabric with crocheted edge, also purchased for display purposes. Ch eck out Sophie's blog if you'd like to play along or see some other fabulous finds ! Playing around with new shapes and patterns this week... I've been wanting to create some butterflies for a while now, somehow the delicate lace impressions in the clay combined with the shape of this precious winged creature seem like such a good match. A little early perhaps but having missed the opportunity to create any Christmas ornaments altogether last Christmas I figured I better get myself sorted this year... Experimenting with baubles and snowflakes, working out which lace patterns are best suited to their shapes and the Christmas season... I've also put in an order for some new snowflake cutters in rather special shapes. Can't wait to receive them and see how they will look! I've also been finalising some prints on the lovely recycled paper I ordered to complement the kraft gift boxes for my ceramic pieces. I like to include a short artist profile with each customer order, with just a little background information on how my pieces are made. I wanted it to have something special to it so I asked my mum (who loves origami) if she had any ideas for some simple letter-folds. This was one of the patterns she sent me, I love how the paper just folds into itself to create a nice little envelope, no further packaging needed! It also fits in nicely into the gift box. Thanks mum! For more creative spaces head over to Kootoyoo!

Please excuse this late post but I'm sure you'll love getting to know her a little better as much as I have! Please tell us a little bit about yourself: "My name is Sophie Isobel, I’m a little bit 50’s housewife and a touch Alice in Wonderland and when I’m not teaching English and Literature you will find me in my studio, dreaming and creating. Inspired by the days of yesteryear, Victorian literature and the art of accessorising, I create brooches, accessories and artwork using my vintage typewriter and lovely scraps of fabric and ephemera that celebrate all my favourite things." Image © Sophie Appleby What is your creative background and how long have you been creating your art? "I’ve always loved making things, as a child I would create dresses from old tablecloths and curtains and raid my grandmother’s card collection for pretty pictures to cut out. Since then I have been collecting, journaling and chasing beauty and in the last two years my ideas have leapt off the page. I have a Bachelor of Creative Arts which is more focused on writing and literary theory. Playing with scissors, glue and fabric has always been an escape for me and I'm delighted that I can now blend these two worlds in my work." Where, what or who do you draw your inspiration from? "My world is a constantly inspiring adventure. I try to keep a really open mind and find inspiration in the little details. From the beautiful old architecture in my neighbourhood and classic children's books to antique shops and reading fabulous blogs, for me inspiration is everywhere." Image © Sophie Appleby What can you tell us about your work? "I am fascinated by the art of accessorising and always loved to sit at my grandmother's dressing table and look at all her beautiful pieces of jewellery. I love the idea of wearing something that gives people a little hint about your personality, something truly unique, so when I began thinking about accessories I wanted to create this was always in the back of my mind. My signature 'I heart' brooches are all unique, no two are exactly the same and I love that in wearing one you can celebrate what you love in the world." Where do you create your art and what is your workspace like? "I work from home in my little cottage studio, I love to surround myself with beautiful and unusual bits and pieces and am always on the lookout for lovely old boxes to store things in. My studio is constantly changing and I'm always working on an inspiration board or two, full of beautiful images. My favourite items in my studio are my grandmother's sewing machine and my library catalogue drawers. I always have fresh flowers from the garden in vases and tea pots and if the rapping of typewriter can be heard, you know I'm busy creating." What is your day job or are you a fulltime artist? "I'm also a high school English and Literature teacher, I love both my jobs and although there is never quite enough hours in my day one very often inspires the other. At lunch time you will sometimes find me sewing brooch backs whilst facilitating a creative writing workshop." Image © Sophie Appleby What are your goals/aspirations for the future? "I often say, when I grew up I want to be.. and the list goes on for pages. I have days I would love to go back to university and study costume design and others I'd really love to become a Librarian, so I can spend my days surrounded by books. I also love writing and would like to finish the novel I'm currently working on in the next few years. I am always doing at least five things at once and dreaming up new ideas, so my goal is to enjoy every moment and dabble in all the delights the world has to offer, whatever they may be." :: Click here to view all Sophie's work on Udessi :: The Finders Keepers have announced their market dates for 2010 and we're very excited they'll be coming back to Brisbane this year ~ as well as of course continuing their events at the stunning contemporary art centre CarriageWorks in Sydney’s Inner West.

Down a secret road, where the public isn't allowed... ...a grove of orange trees grows. The trees are about a hundred years old, I figure. Big, fluffy trees with branches that droop to the ground, where little purple wildflowers reach up to kiss the oranges. The trees are precious and well cared for. They grow in the part of the Huntington Library and Gardens that most people don't see. The Huntington property is about 250 acres but 100 or so of those acres are closed to visitors. Last week, on a cool, overcast day, I got to wander those quiet acres because I know a person in high places: a docent we'll call the Altadena Hiker . More to come. Zen Monday is the day you experience the photo and give us your thoughts rather than me telling you what I think the photo's about. There's no right or wrong. It means what you think it means, or what you want it to mean. I look for a photo worth contemplating or, failing that, something odd or silly. And unless I absolutely must say something I stay out of the comments box to avoid influencing the intellectual path of the discussion, because when I get in there everything goes downhill. As I post each new Zen Monday photo I add a label to last week's to identify it if necessary. I'm one of those creatures who needs sun. So is Boz. Like the kitty in this photo, every morning Boz positions himself in a sunny spot by the window and soaks up the rays. Our rainy season affects him so badly that on gray days he gets downright depressed. You've never seen such misery in a spoiled pet. Today is one of my favorite days of the year because we set our clocks forward one hour . Now we can finally get a few extra rays of sunlight each day. Daylight Saving Time was invented by a New Zealand entomologist named George Vernon Hudson . He wanted more daylight hours after work at his day job for collecting bugs. (The things you learn on Wikipedia!) Fine with me. What I can't figure out is why we have to set our clocks back in the fall. It's Saturday. I thought we should have something festive! This was one place I thought would survive the recession. We all want more for our dollar these days. But I never shopped there so I don't know what kind of value they offered, if any. I've noticed lately the parking lot's full, so someone's at least getting use out of that. When I peeked in the windows I saw an expanse of tile and reflections. But when I stood close to the building to photograph the colorful meters, the blinds moved. It's fun time for the San Gabriel Valley blog community. This means not just bloggers, but blog visitors, too--whether you comment or not. Just because you're reading this right now, you're invited to the SGV Blogger's Potluck on March 20th! Wasn't that easy? It's a chance to meet your blog friends face-to-face. It's hosted by some of your favorite Altadena bloggers. Last year it was a blast (not like the picture, though). Come! There's one catch. You have to bring something to share. You know, like, food. It's a potluck. Today's photo is a relatively nondescript parking lot at the corner of Walnut and Marengo. I keep taking pictures of it and not liking them (gee, I wonder why). I finally just played with it and was satisfied. After all, today's post is about playing. Sometimes you've just gotta. UPDATE: Look what Thal sent: according to his comment today, this was the Beaux Arts style Wilson School, formerly at this location. "After the 1933 Long Beach earthquake," says Thal, "many such buildings were demolished as unsafe. Then this corner remained vacant for a long time, owned by the city, and then when the LA County Court needed a parking lot, this ugliness was built." Meaning the parking lot which, even with my most playful alterations, doesn't hold a candle to the Wilson School. Today the City Daily Photo blogs pay tribute to our founder, Eric Tenin. It's a good day for such a celebration because today is the 5th Anniversary of Eric's hugely popular blog, Paris Daily Photo . To date, Eric and his blog have inspired 1178 City Daily Photo blogs around the world, including this one. Quoting from the instructions for today's theme day: "Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, all CDPBloggers are invited to post a tribute shot from their own city using The Tenin Technique of placing the camera on the ground to make an image, or of skewing/tilting the composition, or in some way imitating a specific photo Eric has posted or a common subject matter of Eric's photos...Have fun with it, make it your own and help celebrate a great guy who has spread a lot of friendship and inspiration around the globe since his first post in 2005." I'm a big fan of Paris Daily photo and of Eric, who really does "spread friendship and inspiration" with his photos and blog. He loves the low angle, likes to tilt the camera, occasionally gets a lot of feet in the picture and, due to French law, blurs the recognizable faces. I can't bring you the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower! (Paris Daily Photo joke), but I can give you a few feet! And a little low angle tilting is the least I can do for a guy who, whether he means to or not, has done so much for so many. How do you post a photo a day, every day, for five years? Maybe some of today's participants will find out. Click here to view thumbnails for participants in today's theme. Not, like, as in "woof." Although it's high time for another Boz post. This is a close-up of a tree (what kind?) shedding its bark in Washington Park. I've downloaded a bunch of photography apps on the iPhone but I never use them. I'm sure I will sooner or later, but I'm not into messing with photos too much. I like the act of capturing the thing I see. I think "capture" is a good word for it because I see something interesting and I want to take it with me. The photo is a method of doing that inside of the law. The colors in this bark were intense, but I think the camera gave it some oomph. Okay so it wasn't a church. It was a mortuary. I thought I'd show you a few more pictures from the building at Holly St. and Marengo Ave. that we talked about on Monday. Behind these gates is the courtyard section of Eden Garden Bar &amp; Grill , formerly Holly St. Bar &amp; Grill. (I had to mess with the picture a little.) The restaurant has indoor seating as well. Here's a doorway off another courtyard. Nice way to enter your office each morning. Just steps away from City Hall!
We're leaving for the log cabin in the next hour or so. (I've been calling Greg at work every 30 minutes to tell him to please hurry up. Scout is getting upset and Marvin is ready to leave without him. Ha!) Tomorrow, I am meeting a blogger friend from The Retirement Chronicles for lunch in Mackinaw City. This will make the fifth blogger friend I've met in person so far. Watch out - you could be next! This past weekend we went to the Detroit Kennel Dog Club Show and Scout's brother won 2nd place in the Bernese Mountain dog puppy division! His name is Jet. (And at our last play date, he kept making out with Scout and I had to tell him to take it easy!) Here's a photo of Jet. Isn't he a handsome boy? It was fun to see so many Bernese Mountain Dogs in one place. I wanted to take this boy home with me but his owner said no. I fell in love with this Anatolian Shepherd and decided I want one of these too! Greg dragged me away from the breeder, begging them not to answer my questions and to just ignore me. (I got their business card - ha!) And finally, doesn't this sign crack you up? Scout: I'm having a great day today! It's sunny and I've been playing in the backyard! As long as I have my mommy, dirt to dig and toys to bury, I'm very happy! Marvin: All I need is a patch of sunlight and for that dog to stay outside - and then it's a great day! My Loons should be back within the next 30 days. I'm so excited! I have to get ready. Get the kayak geared up. Another memory card for my camera. And a bull horn so I can yell at all those boaters and jet skiers who get too close to my Loon babies! Here's a video so you can hear how beautiful the Loons sound. Okay, some of you already know how I'm always waving from the deck of my log cabin to my non-acknowledging neighbors across the lake. About half the time it's in the morning when I'm wearing my crazy pajama pants and now combined with my big fluffy ski coat. Looks great, I promise! (HA!) Anyways, the ice fishermen fascinate me. I'm always checking them out with the binoculars to see if they've caught any fish. Imagine my surprise when I was looking at them and saw one of them looking back at me with their binoculars! I waved. And you know what.....he waved too! I'm making progress people..... Do you think I need to throw this bird feeder away? Some updates: School is going well! I was recently inducted into Phi Theta Kappa which is an honors program for community colleges. Greg is joking now he's married to a sorority girl! Okay - then on spring break, he better take me to Florida! Also, I've been volunteering at a local hospital and just love it. The highlight of my week last week is when this angry man was yelling and swearing at a fellow volunteer next to me because he felt like she gave him inadequate directions. When he left, I asked the woman "Who is that?" She replied "The pastor!" LOL!!!! I miss all of you and will be around to visit. (I miss your humor Suz & Jen, I miss your stories and history Betsy, I miss your decorating Penny, I miss your comments Wendy a.k.a. little sis, I miss your projects Sandi, I miss all your interesting tidbits Mildred - and so much more!) Please let me know if I've missed anything! I think it's already snowed 4 or 5 inches and it's still coming down! About 26 degrees but the weatherman says "it feels like 14" - okay then. School was canceled tonight - woo hoo! Oh wait, I don't have any classes on Tuesday night...figures! How is the weather in your neck of the woods today? Here's some photos of my snow monster Scout enjoying the snow! She is a tomboy just like her mom... This sign is posted in our moose-themed bathroom. My hubby gets a lot of use out of this one...ha, ha! Somewhere out of the log cabin.... ...down a wooded winter road.... ....a man tries to walk his spoiled Bernese Mountain Dog. The "offender" in question, who shall remain anonymous, has decided to test the man and show him who's boss. Little does the man know, the "offender" doesn't do this with mommy!
Almost every session I've attended at SXSW this year has been SRO, including our own, which was gratifying. Last year, 10,000 campers convened at the Convention Center in Austin. This year, the number I've heard is 14,000. You have to get to sessions early, or sit on the floor. But even finding a space on the industrial carpet isn't easy, especially near wall outlets. I was glad to snag a seat in this crowd gathered for "Extend Your Brand, There's an App for That" with Shiv Singh and Adrian Ho, moderated creatively by Brian Morrissey.foodThere's too many sessions, too little time to sit down for meals which are generally grabbed on the run from first floor cafe stands or food trucks which of course have their own twitter accounts.making a session is as challenging as making a plane at JFKIt takes a bit of planning to navigate Austin Convention Center which is as cavernous as an international airport. Inevitably, when a session is moved, it's moved to a spot furthest geographically from where you are standing. Just like air travel.partiesMany, many, many. As with sessions, if you don't get there early, you might not get in. Ironically, admittance to many parties the first night required hardcopy printouts of RSVP acceptances-- what? Mobile digerati were expected to have toted their printers? Party hosts have wised up since then and attempts to equalize party access to "first come, first served" have reverted to old-school VIP pass model: you don't need a printer, you nee
It's no secret that I hate Thomas the Tank Engine. I hate most moralising children's shows but I reserve particular venom for Thomas despite the fact I loved the stories when younger and have seen a marvelous stage show. Thomas and his friends are a whiny bunch of disobedient brats; everything about them is gloomy and miserable and tedious. There is no joy and to top it off, every new series has half-a-dozen pointless new characters crow-barred in solely for the merchandising opportunity. I hate Thomas which is not to say that we don't own quite a lot of Thomas kit. It's unavoidable and part of the reason why I have a particularly soft spot for other, less overtly commercial offerings; 'Pingu' , for example, 'Miu Mao' the fabulous Italian claymation cats; and Peppa Pig . Years ago a friend of mine informed me that her three-year-old son loved Peppa Pig and I was slightly bemused as to why a boy would like a show focused on a pink girl-pig but the moment the spud was old enough to watch TV I understood. Peppa, like Pingu and the cats, is all about fun; there is no harsh moral. Sometimes someone might be a little bit naughty, often things go a bit wrong but there's no breast-beating; only kindness and funny and pigs falling about laughing. I love Peppa Pig. In fact, I may possibly have just the teeniest tiniest crush on Daddy Pig, as it happens. We already have two Peppa DVDs - it was Peppa who informed my spud that Santa comes down the chimney; Peppa who showed him that it is OK to jump into a muddy puddle and Peppa who makes him laugh at me every time we hear that Peppa's Mummy loves her computer. We probably wouldn't have bought the latest DVD however having been given it for review, I have to say that if you have a boy who loves Peppa or who hasn't met her yet, this is officially your DVD. It's called ' Peppa Pig: The Fire Engine and other stories' and in it, Peppa goes on a train, a fire engine, a rocket and there's even a pirate episode. Seriously, all she needs to do now is to go on a bus and an airplane and the spud might never watch anything again. Until he's buying porn on the internet in 10 years time, that is. Oh, and by the way, the nice Peppa Pig folks have given me an extra copy of "Peppa Pig: The Fire Engine " to pass on to one of you if you can tell me in 20 words or so why you love Peppa (or hate Thomas) and make me laugh in the process - UK format only, I believe. I only have one copy to give away though so funniest wins, as judged by me and a team of Mummy mates, next Friday. Well that was a long time to leave you with a nauseating post. Turns out that staying up and working to 2am 5 or 6 days a week don't leave much time for... er... anything really. I was going to write about the little opening ceremony we went to for Brixton's fancy new square but I lack the motivation to get the pictures off my camera. Instead, I am going to write about the flip-side of parenting, the dark side of my little spud-u-like, the side we've been seeing for a few days now. It starts, this slide into the netherworld, with a bad night. Perhaps he had a nightmare, perhaps a cough... whatever it is, if he has to get up early the next day, he's guaranteed to be in the sort of mood which involves the phrase 'I don't want to'; as in 'I don't want to get up'; 'I don't want to get dressed'; 'I don't want to eat breakfast'; 'I don't want to go to nursery'. Eventually of course, he does all those things. Recently he's taken to wanting me to pull him home from nursery on his scooter which does my back in. On a bad day, if I refuse he whinges all the way home. 'It's too difficult'; 'I'm too heavy'; 'I don't want to' or more accurately 'I'm too difficult!' Today was bad. He screamed blue murder all the way up our quiet street. I offered to carry his scooter, I held his hand, I walked 3 feet in front encouraging him to follow, I stopped, I pushed him gently from behind thinking it would be fun... this is what it sounded like to the neighbours: 'No, Mummy! No, Mummy! Not like that! Don't go far away Mummy! Don't leave me! Don't Stop! You're pushing me down! You're pushing me down!' We got to our front steps and he refused to walk up, instead lying down on the wet pavement, sobbing at the top of his lungs. I tried to pick him up and he flopped. I practically had to stuff him into the house. Within seconds of getting inside he was happily demanding pasta and turning on the Wii. I was at the window, nervously waiting for child services to show up. Inevitably the day closed to a familiar sound-track: 'I don't want to habba bath'; 'I don't want to wear my jamas'; ' 'I don't want to go to bed'. Eventually, of course, he did all those things. The key word here is 'eventually' as it takes a lot of negotiation to get him to stay in bed and even then he can remain defiant until the last: Crap. Seriously help me here, I'm about to commit a proper blogging crime. A cardinal sin, if you like. I am about to get irrationally gooey. I am about to vomit saccharine emotion all over your screen. You can stop reading. It's ok. You can navigate away right now, read no further, I won't mind. If one of you can stop and hold my forehead and rub my back for a second it might make it easier but you don't have to. Seriously, you go. Right. Let's get this mess started. So, tonight, the spud decided to go to sleep in our bed and, since I was tired too, we both had a bath and got into our jammies and lay down in bed. I read him 3 Dr. Seuss books. He had some warm milk. We pulled up the duvet. He snaked a little arm under my head and pulled me to his cheek. I was feeling, I have to tell you, pretty relaxed at that point. Then, the frog came home and picked up a guitar and immediately the spud wanted to "play your tar?" The frog put the guitar on the bed and we played, then he left to have his own bath and I made the two chords that I know while the spud strummed. OK here it comes. I showed my boy a little tune and we lazed about having fun with it and not talking and then out of the blue he turned to me, looked at me levelly for a second and said 'I love you... really big' and he smiled beatifically, as though he had just given me a holy benediction. Then he turned and went back to the guitar. You see. Very very very sweet. Pretty much enough to hoist your pancreas into overdrive. Thanks for letting me spew that one out. I'll get me coat. We had one of the Spud's best friends over for a playdate yesterday. They see each other infrequently now that the Spud has left the wonderful-but-far-away Montessori nursery where they both went and is now at the less-than-wonderful-but-close local nursery, but they are still great mates and I am very fond of his Mum, which is always a bonus. There's always a sting in the tail when we see this particular friend because, although he is lovely and gentle and funny and bright, having continued with Montessori, he can write his own name now. Yes, I know. No no, same age. Exactly yes, born on the same day even. Sigh. Anyway so on Saturday during lunch he was lecturing the spud on what was going to happen to his fish fingers, because he now knows that food goes into the mouth, down the gullet, then into the stomach, through to the little intestine, into the big intestine and then comes out as poo. The spud was fascinated. I nearly ate my hand in envy (it wouldn't fit down my gullet...). I have never wanted to be one of those pushy parents that force information into their offspring but, er, it is quite cool to, you know, watch kids learn stuff. And stuff. So, today when he was complaining that his tummy hurt I took the opportunity to remind my Spud of those things his friend had told him. I reminded him that he had a full tummy AND a full intestine and he might need to do a poo, something he's managed to avoid for a couple of days. This resulted in him doing a series of fairly alarming stomach contractions. Thinking he was going to make himself ill I asked him what was wrong and he said "Nuffin. I'm trying to make my poo flat so my tummy doesn't hurt." A little information. A dangerous thing. We had an accidental playdate on Tuesday. We were leaving the nursery when the very brave mother of one of his friends invited us around for pancakes as she was already having a few people over. It was pouring with rain and I left the house under the shelter of my new umbrella, an item I am capable of losing in seconds as witnessed by the fact that I lost it twice the day I bought it. This is normal umbrella etiquette for me, 10 years ago I lost 3 of them in two days and until this recent purchase, I haven't owned one since. I also packed a pocket umbrella for the Spud, an item which has survived for the entirety of my marriage to the Frog purely because I made a pact never to use it. We headed out from nursery, a little pack of bedraggled humans under various hoods and brollies. We arrived and immediately the children formed a pack and started pulling the house to pieces while us Mums formed a second pack and destroyed a bottle of wine. Pancakes were made. Pancakes were eaten. Bedtime passed. Nobody noticed for at least an hour. By the time we left it was quarter past nine and pouring with rain. The spud insisted on riding his scooter so I carried his bag, my bag, and, triumphantly, both of our umbrellas. We walked along, him scooting next to me under my shelter and me feeling incredibly, unbelievably smug for not having left our brollies at either the nursery or with our friends. I thought, as we walked through the rain-dark streets, happily talking about how deep the puddles were and what a fun evening we had, that perhaps I am finally to be trusted with an umbrella. Perhaps, I thought, my native forgetfullness has been cured by the added need for attention that motherhood brings, and that perhaps - just perhaps - this one might be for keepsies. I was smug all the way home, until I realised I was wearing only my jacket and that my coat, with my house-keys still in its pocket, was hanging, forgotten, over our host's balustrade. Ah me. One of the things I felt the lack of when I was pregnant was a sense of continuity for my child. My husband and I live ages from our families, neither of us have a family home or church or school that we can hope our child will go to; there is no family christening gown or aged rocking horse... I thought everything was going to have to be new. About a year ago however, I loaded onto the record player in his room a Dr. Seuss album from the 1960s which I have been toting around with me since... well, since the 1960s frankly. It was The Sleep Book (b-side: If I ran the Zoo). He loves it, but he likes 'Green Eggs and Ham' even more which we read along with the record. Shortly afterwards I went to visit my parents and discovered a box of wonders in their cellar. Now he drifts off to sleep under a Winnie The Pooh blanket made for me when I was his age by some unidentified aunt, perhaps, or family friend; he plays with my ancient building blocks and eats his pasta from my old Bunnykins bowl (which the frog hates; too twee and bourgeois and covered in bunnies) and he plays with some of my old cars, including a tiny London bus I've had for at least 35 years which he refers to as 'your special bus, Mummy'. It's cool, I'm remembering more and more things from my early years. We're singing songs from 'Little Toot' while he's in the bath, a title which I have to say always makes me chuckle and go 'la la la' a lot - because what girl can remember all the words to a song about a tugboat 40 years after the fact? I'm enjoying handing these pieces of my childhood on to my own child and am very conscious that this sharp and often wearisome thing we call the present is actually his past and the most important thing we can give him. There are a few more things in the mystery box that he will inherit as the years go by but the most important thing is, of course, a sense of family; a sense of continuity. Something that I hope ultimately will hold me in good stead when I am old and frail and in need of a real special bus; or at least, a son with enough charity to keep an eye out for his old Ma and perhaps wrap her knees with a Pooh blanket on a cold afternoon. Well, just what I always wanted, having to take a holiday day because Charlie has been excluded from nursery for having a runny tummy. I'm not sure what's worse, him being ill (which judging by his performance today, he isn't) or me having to waste a holiday day during an exceedingly busy period at work. I'm still not feeling tippy top after a few days of illness, although have managed popcorn and a banana today (soooooo healthy.....) but given I don't have to struggle into a desk through cold weather and rush hour traffic I could easily put in a day's work so really cannot justify a sickie. What's lovely however is us hanging low together. I'm getting some work done and we're being very very lazy. So far today he's painted a picture, eaten copiously, watched 'Shrek', played computer games and, er... lordy I think that's it. Currently he's playing 'Shrekcart' on my iPhone, a device which is possibly under-rated as a babysitter; although earlier on he took a picture of me in all my morning glory and I caught him right in the act of posting it onto Twitter so I admit to the possibility of being wrong on that one. Shortly we're going to head to the park to get some air which will probably do us both some good. Today has all the redolence of a day off school when I was young and I've realised why - because that's exactly what it is, only this time I am in the place of my own Mum; trying to get some work done while amusing my bored offspring who is well enough to feel restless but not quite well enough to be insistent. He's cuddly and funny and sweet and is playing by himself the best he can, given that he is only 3. It's cold outside, warm inside and I see a lovely warm bath and an early bed in our future... and a weekend of work; but that's a few days away and for now, we'll just eat our cheese toasties, get into our warm clothes and go and feed some ducks. anon. The last few days the Frog and I have been fighting off nausea and a general sense that we feel ill. The spud has been his high-stepping self until this morning when, halfway to an out-of-town visit, about 45 minutes from home, he threw up his breakfast all over himself. Nothing like negotiating the entry to the M4 whilst listening to one's offspring redecorate the back of the car. I need here to leave a word of thanks to the goddess as right at the entrance ramp there is a petrol station; so just as he was heaving his last and seconds before we got sucked into the vortex of the motorway I was able to stop and get the poor kid cleaned and changed. We turned for the journey home, 45 minutes of auditory and other sensory delights as the spud's stomach proved it wasn't just fooling around. Once back, bathed, reclothed, cuddled and tucked onto the sofa with "Ice Age" while I washed various car-related items (and two sets of his clothes) he felt well enough to ask for a little warm chocolate milk and once that had been down for half an hour with no ill effects, I offered him a dry biscuit. I have very bland taste in biscuits. My favourites are Digestives and if given a choice between say, a Bourbon vs a Rich Tea I'll take the Rich Tea every time. Recently I discovered these cheapo, very plain, very lo-calorie biscuits which are, I believe the acme - or perhaps it should be the nadir - of how plain a biscuit can possibly be. I love them and I gave one to the spud an hour ago. He took it. He looked at it. "Is this for Elsie?" he said, holding it up and talking about our elderly next door neighbour. "Or for Papi Georges?" his 81 year old Grandfather. "It's a Papi Georges biscuit!" Only 3 and already he's assigning food into age-appropriate brackets. It stayed down by the way and now he's demolishing cheerios. We may have to conclude that he is simply be car sick. I know that right now I, personally, am sick of the car. .

They're Katahdins, and this hardy breed has hair rather than wool that, as you can see here , comes off each year on its own. One of the biggest problems we face raising our mostly Suffolk meat sheep here in Missouri is internal parasites, specifically a blood sucking stomach worm known as the barber pole or wire worm . For much of the year it's wet and warm here, which, unfortunately, is Parasite Paradise. Despite agressively using both commercial and natural wormers, we've lost numerous sheep over the years to worms—and we've been comparatively lucky. I know of one farmer who had most of her flock drop dead from internal parasites—the day after they'd been wormed. It's terrible. And while there were many benefits to having that extra rain during the past two springs and summers, it made the parasite problem even worse. Ram Lambs Lined Up for Our Inspection (we chose the one on the far left) Katahdin sheep are naturally parasite resistant, and a couple of years ago we got to talking about them with our shearer while he was shearing our sheep. A few weeks later we drove over to his farm and picked out a three-month-old, 75-pound, registered Katahdin ram lamb (whose father was a US champion) to breed to our mostly Suffolk ewes. When Joe saw me squealing over all the corralled cuteness before I could even climb out of the truck, he said it was a really good thing we hadn't brought a big stock trailer. You Carry the Lamb Low so the Mama Can See and Smell It We also got a great deal on two registered Katahdin ewes who each had a newborn lamb by their side, including one&nbsp;who had been born that morning. These were the first ewes I purchased since buying my original flock back in 1995. I've always&nbsp;kept a closed flock, expanding it by holding back the best ewe lambs. The only sheep purchased and brought in were rams, which&nbsp;are replaced every couple of years to avoid inbreeding. The New Ram and the Littlest New Member of the Flock Sadly, the strapping Katahdin ram lamb was killed by coyotes out in the front field the first morning he was let out of his quarantine holding pen. You can read more about that terrible killing season (which, paws crossed, is permanently over thanks to our super livestock guardian dogs, Marta and Daisy ) here . Edward on the Job in Fall 2009 (the girls sometimes play hard to get) Not willing to give up on our plan, we returned to the sheep shearer's farm and picked out another young Katahdin ram. We named him Edward, and in spring 2009, our first Katahdin/Suffolk cross lambs were born. (There are some other breeds mixed in, bred down from some of my original mixed breed ewes, from the Border Leicester ram I used the first few years, and from a wonderful Hampshire ram we had in 2002 and 2003.) We also bred the two Katahdin ewes&nbsp;with Edward in order to get some more purebred Katahdins, and they each had twins. Emmy Lou Back Then And Emmy Lou Now The Katahdin ewe lamb that arrived here as a newborn, and who I recently (finally!) named Emmy Lou, was also bred when Edward jumped through 11 strands of barbed wire in order to continue breeding season (another story I never got around to telling). She gave birth in spring 2009 to this little cutie pie we named Friendly. The other newborn lamb was a ram, and he eventually went into our freezer so we could see how we liked the taste of Katahdin meat (it's very good). That gave us a total of seven purebred Katahdin ewes to breed. We've been thrilled so far with these Katahdin and Katahdin crosses and have high hopes going into spring grazing season, which is one of the wormiest times of the year, especially since hormones in the nursing ewes make them especially susceptible. We're still aggressively worming, but now we're mostly using a drench (liquid squirted into the throat with a drench 'gun' connected to a 'backpack' holding the liquid) of organic raw apple cider vinegar and garlic juice. - We're also still adding diatomaceous earth, an all natural wormer (which has dozens of other uses, especially in the garden), in with both their grain treats and salt/mineral mix. Our sheep have never looked better. Even the lambs of the ewes who had bad parasite problems last year aren't wormy. Okay, I hadn't planned to go all the way back to 2008 to begin the explanation of why our 2010 lambing season started several weeks earlier than expected, but I've actually been meaning to explain how and why we now have Katahdins ever since we got them, especially&nbsp;since many of you have been asking. Anyway, when I called the sheep shearer to arrange this year's shearing , I asked if he happened to have any big Katahdin ewes for sale, big enough to breed with our big Suffolk ram, Da Big Guy, and he said yes. He had some pregnant six-year-olds for sale who were good sheep with nothing wrong except that they were six years old (many sheep breeders prefer to not to keep ewes older than five). He even could deliver them when he came to shear. I asked him to pick out the two biggest ewes, and he brought us these gorgeous girls—who both had triplets last year. My main concern with the Katahdins is that we're going to lose the nice big size we've built up over the years with the Suffolks. I prefer to butcher the lambs at about 130 or even 140 pounds, and the purebred Katahdin lambs aren't getting that big. You just don't get as much meat otherwise. We always take the smallest lambs for ourselves, and some years they've only been about 100 pounds, but our customers prefer them bigger (some want them over 150 pounds if possible)—and since the butcher charges a flat processing fee, they also get more for their money with bigger lambs. In 2004, we started naming all babies born on the farm alphabetically: 'A' names for 2004, 'B' names for 2005, etc. It makes things so much easier (and only took me nine years to come up with the idea). Some of you know how long it can take to get a name around here, but amazingly, we've already named our new ewes who were born back in the 'A' year. This is Ava And this is Audrey Ava—whose full name is Ava Gardener so we can remember that these ewes came to live with us in 2010, the 'G' name year—gave birth to these incredibly cute twins last Monday. You can see more photos of them here and here . Audrey just keeps getting bigger. The rest of the ewes should start giving birth around April 1st! Can't wait?

It's even all written, and I was hoping to finish it tonight, but today kind of got away from me—partly because the story ended up&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;longer than planned, and partly because I spent about six hours this morning working on a total blog makeover (so exciting, but what a time suck).

I'll be back later today or (more likely) tomorrow with the story and another dose of baby lamb cute (they are so cuddly). In the meantime, don't forget to stop and breathe it all in. And again.

I've been enjoying so much new music lately that if I could find the time I'd have a song a day to post here. But given that I don't, I have to be content with once or twice a week, and in doing so I invariably skip over songs that I was enjoying earlier in the week. So, it's Sunday afternoon, and the sun is shining and the children are running around the garden in the hazy light that teases us with memories of summer. And this here is what is playing in my kitchen. A sweet, soulful, dreamy song that makes me feel as though we have all the time in the world. Hear more of The Low Anthem&nbsp; here . The second song 'To Ohio' is another favourite I have on repeat, along with the above 'Charlie Darwin.' There is also a gorgeous stop-animation official video to this too which you can see&nbsp; here , but my love of live music overrides even that, and I just had to post a live video. Hope you had a lovely weekend. Enjoy! Well, a few weeks ago I was alerted to the fact that my favourite shop&nbsp;in the world now has a&nbsp; blog . I can't remember when I first discovered&nbsp; Pedlars , it was certainly a few years back and may have been in an interiors magazine that I first saw it mentioned. Over the years, from the time I first received their lovely catalogue into my letterbox, although I would not necessarily have been a big spender, I have bought a number of things and poured longingly over many more. I'm not sure what it is they have that makes it so appealing, but I suspect it has a lot to do with their manifesto: Stuff We Love That You'll Love Too. In other words, they buy and sell stuff they they love, and they happen to have the most amazing taste in the world, which in turn makes it so appealing to the likes of me!&nbsp; One thing I immediately loved when I first flicked through their catalogue was not just the diversity of products, or the overriding sense of fun, or even the downright coolness of it, but the broad range of prices. Here was a shop that had divine lighting that cost hundreds, but they also had pocket-money stuff that not only could the kids afford, but that they actually really wanted! Of course a bit of investigating showed that of course they had lots of children themselves. And they lived in a beautiful house in the wilds of Scotland. As well as the most amazing holiday home &nbsp;which you can rent.&nbsp;And lots of dogs. And all I could think was, darn it, these guys have it perfect. (I'm sure they would laugh at that, but we have to have heros, don't we?) (By the way this is NOT the holiday home!) In their own words: ' we also have an organic farm in Scotland and a Christmas Tree farm, too. We have six children, four dogs, lots of horses and ponies and three chickens. We live in Scotland and in London and we have a fruit and vegetable farm in Wales. We are constantly on the look out for things that interests us.' Sigh... I love everything about Pedlars. They have amazing&nbsp; Vintage finds , fantastic&nbsp; homewares , brilliant&nbsp; fun stuff &nbsp;for all the family, as well as a&nbsp; music club &nbsp;that is right after my own heart. In fact there is so much more to see that I have to just recommend you take yourself on over there and have a look. And I do think&nbsp;what they are doing&nbsp;must be the greatest job in the world. Imagine! So if you get a chance do pop over and become a follower on their&nbsp; blog , and you never know but you might actually win one hundred pounds to spend in their shop! (Because they are very clever.) And even though it's lame to say I was planning to do this post anyway, ever since discovering their blog, and definitely before I did win that very amount yesterday, it is true. Honestly! Nothing &nbsp;more satisfying than finding something for next to nothing is there? Our local town recently had a new addition of a charity (thrift) shop! This is a very telling sign of the times and rather something as this particular well-to-do town is more home to the likes of up-market boutiques and I never thought I'd see a charity &nbsp;shop there. But there it is, and I have to say the quality is delightfully up-market! But of course. And even better, the prices are proper charity shop prices, unlike certain other ones who have been taking the you-know-what of recent years. So I popped in the other day with very little in my purse and no intention really other than to have a look. But I did spend. A little. This sweet cardigan is so perfectly Julia Childs that I&nbsp; couldn't resist it at just €3. I think it's the colour as much as anything. And although this skirt (for €5) doesn't look so great on a hanger, it's lovely on. It's years since I wore something so long and I bought it thinking I would alter it in some way, but it's too nice as it is!&nbsp; But then, part of my intention not to spend was because earlier in the week&nbsp; I had (fatally) gone to my favourite shop,&nbsp; Avoca &nbsp;for breakfast and as&nbsp; usual stopped to look at their sale rail on the way out. Shopping with friends&nbsp; can be bad for you. Persuasive friends. Friends who insist you try on that dress that made you gasp when you saw it, and then rave about how perfect it is on you...sigh... I am weak...I am. So I bought it. And, yes it was on the sale rail, but this is Avoca we are talking about...&nbsp; So I won't be telling you how much I paid for it, even when one friend was cheeky enough to ask them to knock a bit more off it (which they did!).&nbsp; It wasn't huge. It was less than €100. But still more than I would usually spend. But I had to. And I'm glad I did. Because it is just so lovely. A friend said it is like something out of Bagpuss, which is so apt because that is a world that still exists in my head. Some days I think in my head I am in that little shop: Bagpuss &amp; Co. It's perfect. A shop that doesn't sell anything. It's just a place for lost things... Take a little peep here. This is&nbsp;my childhood,&nbsp;this is all that makes me who I am today. I cannot think of anything that captures it better. Listen here for more of Danny And The Champions Of The World. Here's a band we've been listening to over the last week or so, and I really wanted to share this video with you. I don't think it's an official video, I think it's probably fan made. But from the first time I watched it I've come back to it again and again. Because it is just so incredibly moving.&nbsp; It's such an uplifting song, and coupled with footage that is simply people dancing, it somehow breaks my heart, in a good way. Dancing is such a human thing, and done with such quiet joy and confidence and honesty, with no self-consciousness, that it becomes a thing of great beauty. And watching it my heart is filled with such great love for humans. I can't explain it. But maybe one of you will get what I mean too. And even if you don't, it's a joy to watch, regardless.&nbsp; And do turn up the volume a little! I can't believe I haven't posted here about this band before now! Back in November I was thrilled to read that on the back of their new album,&nbsp; Midlake &nbsp;were on tour, and coming to Dublin. I was still feeling grumpy that I had missed out on no less than four gigs by bands I would love to have seen, so I was determined not to miss this and bought tickets the day they came out. I've been listening to the new album and it is just gorgeous, with echoes of English Folk that just rolls over you like warm water. I wondered if I would like The Courage of Other's as much as I loved their previous album The Trials of Van Occupanther which is on my list of Albums I Never Get Tired Of, and so far I am loving it. (The above song is from the Van Occupanther album). Have a listen&nbsp; here &nbsp;for some more songs from The Courage of Other's. So, that's where we'll be tomorrow night, and I'm looking forward to it, to a night of meeting and eating with friend's, a night of live music, of being transported away for the evening. Happy Valentine's Day to you all, and I hope you get to do something lovely, wherever you are! Update:&nbsp; It was amazing. They were brilliant. It really is something else to see seven incredible musician's up on stage, playing together like one fluid entity, each playing one unique layer of sound, yet knowing exactly where everyone else is, all in a perfect, seamless fusion of beautiful &nbsp; music. And they did &nbsp;take beloved songs and bring them to another level, and it was everything a live show should be. I have to say, the above song was one of the highlights for me. The drumming alone on this song was heady stuff, and just gorgeous. So, a happy girl I am. This will keep me warm for many weeks to come! And A Few Of My Favourite Things. I was never one for fashion magazines. Although if someone produced a Vintage/Thrift fashion magazine I would no doubt be a fan. The only exception might be the Irish magazine&nbsp; Prudence &nbsp;which is not only aimed at people who are broke, but it doesn't have a ridiculous price tag like most fashion mags do. I like that! This may be why I love places like Etsy &nbsp;and ebay. But of course that takes time to browse, something I don't have an awful lot of. Which is why magazines are great, I guess! I do go through phases of buying Interiors magazines when I need inspiration, my favourites being Homes and Antiques , and&nbsp; Living Etc. But my absolute, all-time-favourite, can't-live-without magazines have to be my monthly music regulars Uncut &nbsp;and&nbsp; Mojo . I just love to hide away with these and a cup of coffee&nbsp;for an hour or so and devour every word I can. It's never enough, but there is a month's worth of reading in them and by the time the next one is out I have just about finished it. And you get a free cd each month too. My favourite pages are the music review pages, which is where I find all sorts of jewels, both new and old, new bands, new singers, new albums, rereleases. It's all there. And if I like the sound of it I'll take myself off to Spotify &nbsp;to check them out. (Although sometimes you have to wait a couple of weeks for a new album to be available to listen to.) One thing I have discovered from reading these two magazines is the record label&nbsp; Jagjaguwar , which is host to some of my all-time favourite bands like&nbsp; Bon Iver &nbsp;and&nbsp; Volcano Choir . This months Uncut included a cd of songs from bands on this label, some of which I have heard of, some I haven't. And I wanted to share the one that jumped out for me, the one I am listening to on loop. From British Columbia,&nbsp; Pink Mountaintops. Their sound reminds me somewhat of&nbsp; Mazzy Star &nbsp;gone somewhat gospel,&nbsp;and someone else I can't put my finger on. Last year's album 'Outside Love' is just gorgeous. Have a&nbsp; listen here . (The title track in particular is sublime). So, let the middle of the week just slide right on by us. I am focused on the weekend, with the right kind of laidback sounds to keep me company. And plenty of reading material, which I've no doubt will furnish a number of posts here on ~Carnival~. Hope your week is going swimmingly for you too. And what might you be listening to? I have been entranced. Yet again. On loop in my kitchen, in my car, is 'July Flame', the new album from the lovely Laura Veirs. A number of years back my sister, Emma, gave me a copy of 'Carbon Glacier' which she had picked up in the US. I loved it. From the first listen. And the following year went straight out and bought her follow up album 'Year of Meteors'. When she played in Whelan's the week before Emma went back to the states for good, we went to see her, sat right up the front, and I cried at least twice. She was amazing. And yes, I was emotional about saying goodbye to Emma. But Laura Veirs rocked. In a sweet sort of way. So, when I read the reviews in my favourite music magazines, Mojo and Uncut, and words like enchanted, suffused, and mysticism were used, I just had to check it out. And it didn't disappoint me. As I said. I have been entranced. And the inclusion of the likes of Laura Gibson and the mighty Jim James of My Morning Jacket just sends me into raptures! There is hardly a wrong note on the whole thing. Laura is on tour at the moment, though I was very sad to read they won't be coming to Dublin this time. But seeing as Laura is very pregnant I figured it wouldn't be fair to make a fuss! Do check out her&nbsp; blog &nbsp;over on her website. And while there you can have a look at some of their other&nbsp; videos &nbsp;too. You can also listen and buy her (six) other albums, as well as a recording of a young French choir who recorded nine of her songs, the result of which is a strangely moving experience. If you think you might be interested you can also listen to more from Laura Veirs&nbsp; here . And read reviews or download songs&nbsp; here . I so wish I could post the track called 'Little Deschutes' here for you to listen to. I am listening to it as I write, with goosebumps. It truly is sublime. But the album is so new I haven't found it anywhere that can post here. So have a listen if you come across it. ' I wanted to make something sweet, The blood inside the maple tree, the sunlight trapped inside the wood, make something good.' Nothing like a weekend away, is there? As I mentioned&nbsp; over on Milkmoon , myself and Jay managed to escape for a long weekend to visit some friends, Marta and Sam, in Madrid. And as everyone knows, there is nothing better than having someone who knows the city for finding the best of everything! So, there was endless wanderings around the streets of Madrid, and on Saturday myself and Marta took ourselves off &nbsp;and we found a number of vintage shops which I was very excited about. And let me say, the prices were amazing. This sweet dress was €18, and it's in mint condition. I am loving tweed and plaid at the moment, and I couldn't resist this rather school~mistressy kilt for €10! It's 100% wool and so warm , which was just what I needed as we traipsed about in the snow. And this gorgeous leather bag which we both admired in the window, Marta bought, and then gave to me (sweet thing that she is!) was €5.95!! I love it so much! I could have filled an entire suitcase with fabulous finds, but as we were restricted both financially and in terms of baggage I had to limit myself, sadly. But I am already planning my next trip, hopefully in June for Finn's 12th birthday. I promised her a Mum~and~me trip somewhere, and I think it might just be Madrid! With two empty suitcases...

I am having a really HARD time focusing. This semester is kicking my butt for some reason...I have a lot to do, but I've had heavier semesters with more work, so not sure why I'm feeling like my head is just barely above water. ~early this a.m. I finally finished transcribing 20 minutes of a counseling session. It took FOREVER and is 7 pages long (single spaced!) Now I have to go through and make comments throughout regarding my responses and how I was feeling during the session in relation to my responses. THEN I have to write a two page paper about the case. I should really be working on that instead of blogging... ~E and I woke up at 8am this morning. I was so excited to see that we slept in an extra hour. Then I remembered that I changed my clock before going to sleep. Darn! No extra sleep for me. ~Oh and I managed to run 4 miles on Friday evening, but have had lower back pain ever since. not good. i've never had back pain after running before. what is going on? my new best friend...ibuprofen. ~Ok I need to stop reminiscing (fondly) of last weekend and how much fun I had and get back to reality...and studying. ~Happy Sunday~~ ~just to clarify...DisneyWorld is NOT the Happiest Place on Earth it claims to be...just ask E! ~yep, that would be him in FULL MELTDOWN MODE while we were in line for Space Mountain . Upon ride entrance, it was posted as a 30 minute wait but turned out to be closer to 45. Regardless, E hit his limit at about the 20 minute mark...and for NO reason at all except that he didn't want to be there anymore...well I take that back...he DID want to be there, right ON the floor. He was COMPLETELY calm while laying on the (nasty, gross, dirty) floor, but when I went to pick him up....the kicking, wiggling &amp; screaming began. And it was ugly. very, very, ugly indeed. ~I'm glad it was dark/dim in there because I was probably turning 47 shades of red from sheer embarrassment &amp; humiliation. The stares from everyone in line were nearly unbearable for me. I'm one who lets what others think really bother me and while I realize I will never see any of those people again, I was still quite upset about the crazy scene that my fabulous son was making! ~ Dawn (AKA "the baby whisperer") was waiting in line with us and since she didn't want to ride she was able to take E out of line once we reached the point where the line opens up and allows you to do that...which seemed about 1000 miles away at the time. I have never felt a greater sense of relief in my life once he was out of line &amp; no longer sprawled out on the floor. Note: I went on this trip to WDW with plans to ride only 2-3 things and instead spend the majority of time on things E would enjoy...and after this experience in line, I really didn't care if I went on another single ride all weekend. ~Thankfully that was the ONLY time he had a full meltdown over the weekend. ~did I mention we are also struggling with him hitting these days? oh TWO is such a lovely age. please note the extreme sarcasm here. ~oh and here's hoping that age 3 is better than 2 as it's official....I'm signing up for the 2011 WDW Princess 1/2!!! Woohoo! Registration begins on May 1, 2010. OK - I have finally had a chance to complete this post with pictures...Blogger really needs to improve their picture uploading process...one at a time is the pits! Anyway...here we go... Dawn wanted to see my dishes...we got these as a wedding gift and well, after using them, I no longer like them...they are navy blue and the round plates dip in to much, almost making a bowl shape and the small square plates...well those pointy corners are a pain for the dishwasher and well they are just overall a pain. The bowls are "ok", but a tad bigger would be better and the teacups, well, we NEVER use them. Ahhh, they may look good on the shelf initially, but you learn alot once you start USING an item. I'm ready for new dishes, but waiting until more of these break... Beth wanted to see my laundry room. This would probably be the most boring and drab room in the house. In fact, I just recently told O I want to paint it because (1) it's plain white and (2) it is right off the garage so receives all kinds of bangs to the wall etc and could use a coat of paint to brighten it up...please leave me your color suggestions. Hopefully in my next house I'll have a bigger laundry room, it was really something I was searching for before we bought this house, but just didn't work out. This was a hard picture to take, hence two shots, one from each side, because literally the room is only the length of the two machines side my side. Hydrant Girl wanted to see my favorite part of the house...that would be my office...when I'm able to get in there and really get things done or just relax and surf the web. Travel &amp; Dive Girl wanted to see my kitchen counter, where I do my baking...it's not much and it's a bit smaller than I'd like it, but I make do for now. That corner cabinet is where all my baking ingredients are stored, so at least it's convenient. Sara wanted to see my living room as it is now...eeks...toys abound and if you look closely you can see E's head near the fireplace...he was likely adding more toys to the floor. Oh and that window treatment is a thorn in my side...it never stays in place so it usually just looks like a piece of fabric thrown up there. Lindsay wanted to see a view from E's perspective...i took 2 shots... Fidgeting Gidget wanted to see my favorite shirt and my softball glove. I am a "life is good" t-shirt junkie and I really like this one right now... "less is s'more"...haha. And my ancient softball glove - how i miss thee - poor thing hasn't been used since 2006. sad! Brandi wanted to see the entrance or foyer to my house. Sadly my house is so ridiculously small that we don't have a traditional foyer, the front door basically dumps right into our living room...so as you walk in, this is what you see. Also, unless we have guests coming over the front door is rarely used since we come in through the garage. Hula had to squeeze herself into the picture. ~i took E to school this morning and i'm home today working on a long list of things to-do...I should NOT be blogging...let's consider it my lunch break. ~i completed my fafsa for next (and the last) school year. finally!! such a pain! ~I am finishing up the past 2 weeks "reflections" on my counseling activities at the high school...you know, being in this touchy-feely profession means lots of reflecting on myself and how I feel. ~finishing up a couple of lesson plans on nutrition topics. I need to do some classroom guidance in the CDC room for the rest of the semester....I'm way behind on my direct hours. ~made a call to the Disney ticket office. got good news which will hopefully prevent me from losing a day on my 3 day ticket since we only made it to the parks on Sat &amp; Sun. ~heading to the post office this afternoon to mail 4 packages. ~i really need to get all this school stuff done so I can use the weekend to do a transcription of one of my counseling sessions that will occur Thurs/Fri this week. Note: transcriptions take FOREVER...every.single.word.noise.um.like.ok need to be documented. ~i've become a fan of interval running now. really want to go to Target to look for a watch like Meghan had for the race. ~i signed up for a 5K on April 10, 2010...it benefits the schools, I can even pick a particular school to benefit. yay. ~still need to upload my Disney pictures to Shutterfly...dreading that...big time suck. ~back to the schoolwork. ~i took 180 pictures on my Canon Rebel and I took 17 with the point and shoot along the race course...for a grand total of 197 pictures...so that means that the winner is.... AMY !!!!! Let me know where to send your Disney prize... ~I have not been able to download my pictures yet, but here is a brief review of the race...hoping to post pictures later tonight. ~The short story: I met my time goal, finished the 13.1 miles and I avoided the "van of doom"...the one that picks you up if you fall behind a 16/min mile pace. Phew!! ~I got about 4 hrs of sleep the night before the race &amp; was fighting off some intense nerves which caused me to have a super upset tummy.all.night.long. and then I woke 30 minutes before the alarm...ugh. A rough start. ~I met Meghan, Jessica, and Beth in the lobby at absolutely insane hour of 3:30am to head to the race start. We waited around some, used the porta-potties some, froze some, checked our gear, headed to our corral, froze some more, peed in the bushes (where I got burrs all over the back of my shirt) and then finally started our race. ~Meghan, Beth, Page (Beth's friend) and I were all in Corral E and started at 6:28am...after being "in process" for 3 hours... ~Meghan and I ran the first 9 or so miles together doing 5/1 intervals after running the entire first mile. ...at about the 9 mile mark I could not continue with Meghan as I needed more recovery time...she kept going and I lagged behind with a bit more walking, although not too much more. In the end, I finished 6 minutes after her. ~At every mile mark, there was a princess-theme billboard w/time clock and music. There were tons of characters along the way as well and while we thought we would stop for pictures, we quickly changed our mind when we saw the crazy long lines. ~I realized how much I like the song "Holding Out for a Hero" by Bonnie Tyler :) Really though, it has got to be THE perfect "make-you-want-to-run" song. Or maybe it was just that it was playing as I passed the Disney float thingee with 5 Disney Princes on it...i dunno, let's just say it was the song. ~My goal was to finish under 3 hours and I (barely) did just that... 2:58:26 was my finish time. I'm already thinking that's not good enough and want to improve it...I'm sure these feelings will fade in a couple of days. LOL!! ~I would love to do the Princess 1/2 again next year and I'm making tentative plans (in my head)...so now it's just a matter of the stars aligning correctly, i.e. date/timing. ~I took a bunch of pictures. I haven't totaled them up yet, but I will do that tonight and post the winner. ~Oh and I'm still putting together that "pictures of my home" post...hoping to finish that and post this week too.
First I just want to apologize for being away for so long, and am going to catch-up a bit.It's mid-winter, and not alot of riding is being done lately, which makes us all a little stir crazy. So I thought I would bring a little sunshine into our lives, by sharing pics of summer activities not done on the bike. I do have some bike run pics to follow up with, as well as recent additions to my life. Lets get started, shall we?A little boating at Modesto Reservoir in my brother in law's boatI love this pic &amp; can't believe I got this shot!We also did some rafting.....  This guy rigged his own by putting a lawn chair on a piece of wood &amp; setting it down in this canoe!  He was taking on water...We also went and watched some Monster Trucks races with a little Extreme Air motocross mixed in.   A little trip to the zoo....   And of course ya gotta get a ride in....go Marky!Then we headed to San Francisco for my daughter's 21st birthday......   We love to go to San Francisco and enjoyed our time with the family, Happy Birthday!With that said, we also love the mountains just as much or more....  .....Now, we did do a year end Toy Run hosted by Renegade Classics, that benefits local children in need. I don't have many picks of the run, but I do have e few pics if some nice bikes. Okay, last but not least...(as most of you already know), we bought a new Jeep! On 1/2/2010 we went and purchased it. ...Then the first day out, this happened... I don't know how, but it did! And here is
see more Engrish And I'm still alive... a new post coming soon. Cold and dark was the night I skipped through the puddles on the parking lot to get to the warm interior of Panchitos in San Rafael. I remember this place as the first restaurant that I tried taking photos of the actual meal that I ate for posting. Of course the crisp chips with very red salsa comes out. I tried the Vegetarian Burrito this trip. It was pleasing to the eye. I loved the whole pinto beans, and the rice was flavorful too. The inside of the burrito was stuffed with fresh sauteed vegetables. It was slightly heavy on zucchini for my taste, but overall it was really good. I ordered it with guac and sour cream which melded the Mexican flavors. This is a nice neighborhood place with good service and solidly good food.

I wandered into the Blue Skies Cafe in San Rafael early one morning to sample their breakfast fare. The Blue Skies Cafe is tucked away in the Marin County Health and Wellness Connection Center complex near "The Loop". The Blue Skies Cafe is a Buckelew Program, which only makes it even more of a positive place to visit. Buckelew a non-profit organization which assists older youth and adults with mental illness, into homes, jobs and recovery services. The staff were so cheery and worked with me to find a breakfast of my choosing from their array. The food and drink are all mostly on the politically correct list, and good for the planet! I found a beautifully sunny table and enjoyed my meal. The blackberry scone was WOW, and the hard boiled eggs and mocha were great too. You won't find cooked items like omelets or pancakes here, it is mostly boxed for take out and to eat-with-coffee kind of fare. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by for good items within their repertoire, and enjoy the sun!

I met my friend Lori for an Italian seafood dinner one evening in December at Sotto Mare in San Francisco's North Beach. It was one of those cold, inky-black nights. The interior was warm, cozy, and well-loved. We started with the clam chowder, which being hot and creamy was especially satisfying coming in from the cold. I continued the clam theme with Linguine with Clams. It was perfect. The linguine was perfectly al dente, and the clam sauce was classically good. Lori chose Prawn Saute which she enjoyed, including the fresh steamed vegetables which were a colorful and delicious accompaniment. I would certainly revisit this restaurant again for it's solidly good food and friendly ambiance. Weezy's Grass Fed Shed has been on my mind for some time since its opening (and before). Located near Scotty's Market in San Rafael's Terra Linda district, it was just enough out of the way that my visit was delayed. I was happy to find a slice of time to get there and try this wonderful well thought out concept - grass fed beef and veggie burgers served in and with compostable containers, napkins, etc. I was greeted warmly, and ordered a couple burgers. The sizes are small so you can try a variety of toppings. These are just the perfect size for kids. I got a budget-wise combo that included either regular or sweet potato fries, or a mix. I chose the mix, and got a free sample of their dip for the sweet potato fries too. The dip was really great - creamy (cream cheese based?) with a hint of seasonings. No less so the burgers. The vegetarian moo-less burgers were very good. These don't have the texture of a hamburger, and the good taste made that aspect very forgettable. There is a small bar of condiments to top your burger, and I loved that the tomatoes were the Roma type, just the right size to top these 1/8 lb. beauties. I also convinced (it was not very hard) the staff to use a garden patty in a Contiki style burger that has Kikkoman Teriyaki sauce and a piece of pineapple adorning it. I enjoyed them both, and am looking forward to going back. I was also lucky enough to be there at the same time as Weezy's brother. He enlightened me about Weezy and her hope as a mother to create a great community place where kids and the rest can enjoy healthy food quickly in a earth friendly way. She also lives nearby.

SEA Thai Bistro has opened in Corte Madera where the old "Simmer" was located. I've heard the sister restaurant in Petaluma is awesome, so I hope to visit soon and confirm the same of this new and exciting venue. Dad and I stopped in at BJ's Restaurant &amp; Brewhouse the other day in San Rafael's Northgate Mall. We had been searching for men's slippers, a daunting task indeed after the holiday season is over. Having exhausted ourselves finding a pair, we saw the big BJ's sign as a beacon of welcome. We were greeted and seated promptly. We had some Calamari to start off with while we perused the rest of the menu. It was tender and crisp and had a delicious pair of sauces, spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli. I could not resist the Garden Vegetable Potato, a HUGE potato stuffed with fresh vegetables and an alfredo sauce. There was also both jack and cheddar cheese melted on top. It was nearly as big as a pee wee football! It tasted good, however, there needed to be a bit more stuffing to really have enough sauce for that sized potato. And most would not be able to finish it anyway. Dad had the Old Fashioned Pot Roast, slow-roasted Angus beef pot roast that is served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom brown gravy and over roasted vegetables. He loved every drop of it! The only thing that didn't work about this place for my father (and perhaps others) is that the noise level is HIGH. It's hard to carry on a conversation with someone who has good hearing, and is rather miserable for those wearing hearing aids. All in all, it's a recommendable place if you want good food in generous portions in an upbeat, noisy atmosphere. And Happy Valentine's Day! I'm in Seattle right now and am looking forward to sharing some finds on this trip too!

I enjoy trying new drinks so couldn't resist this new product " First Blush " which was offered as a BOGO (buy one get one) at Safeway. There are several varieties of wine grapes represented in the product line up, and this one is from Cabernet grapes. How thick and luxe! It reminded me of homemade grape juice from my Aunt Dorothy &amp; Uncle Jim's ranch. There are also 1.4 servings in this plastic bottle (it easily turns over so be careful with this bright red juice!), and 154 calories per serving... oooh, I consumed over 200 calories by drinking this? Grapes are definitely sweet! There is no added sugar, and with this calorie load, antioxidants or not, this has to be an occasional treat I'm afraid. Speaking of Aunt Dorothy, there have been a few things keeping me away from blogging, as much as I enjoy it. I got one of those calls you never want to get, and found that after a full and happy life, Aunt Dorothy passed at age 94. So I've been trying to put things in order and make travel arrangements to attend her funeral in Yakima, WA this Friday. Unfortunately, the care of my father has become much more involved recently as well. I am too tired to write coherently these days after getting him tucked in, so Anna's Cool Finds has not been having those daily posts that I so enjoy writing. I'm not giving up on this, however, I'm not sure how frequently I'll be able to post for a while.
I can't hear you cuz I'm stupid This is going to be a rant. If you're not interested in reading a rant, come back later when I'm closer to a glass half full of the milk of human kindness. I'd like to have a little talk about cell phones. I don't mean how people so often answer them when they're with other people- friends or strangers- and then have the conversation right there in front of us all as if we'd just before asked what they were up to these days. "Oh my, that's such a long story. I know! Listen in on this call and it'll give you a snapshot." I also don't mean the people who use their cell phones at unsafe times. Say when they're crossing the street. Or when they're turning left on a green light and they're supposed to yield but instead, when the phone rings and it's their dad they feel they have to take it so they do and, they drive right into the front of my car and total it. Being nearly a half century old provides one with more than just a sense of perspective, it also means one can remember things. (Okay not everything. And, no, not always where the car is parked at the store as well as what one is to buy at the store. But I know the words and tune to two different versions of "Hound Dog", all three versions of the Free Credit Report dot Com ads plus the Hillshire Farms commercials, and I know that Pure Prairie League performed " Amie ". So it's not like my brain is devoid of all usefull information.) One thing I remember very clearly is how people used phones before there were cellphones. "Yeah, yeah. Most people remember phones before cellphones. We remember early cellphones. Why on the first few season's of 'The X Files' Mulder's cellphone was so big it looked like he was talking into Maxwell Smart's shoe ." I remember when all I really wanted for Christmas was a Princess phone . I remember when my grandmother refused to use her phone during certain hours because she had a party line - which isn't as much fun as it sounds and doesn't cost $5.99 per minute- and she didn't want to interfere with her neighbor's rights and opportunities to use the phone. And I remember how people reacted when they got a long distance call. I didn't know anyone who got a call from overseas; in all the cases I witnessed the participants were four hours or fewer apart from each other. For each instance the behavior was the same: Someone would answer the phone, they'd determine the identity of the caller and who they wished to speak to, then they would turn to that person and hiss, "It's your mother"- if it was their mother- then in a much louder hiss they'd add "Long distance". You're probably wondering why someone would say "long distance" at that point. If you live in Wisconsin and your mother lives in California and she's calling you from there then naturally she's calling you long distance. No one should have to explain the conditions to you in other words. But the phrase "long distance" was not uttered sotto voce for the benefit of the intended recipient of the call. It was a cue to the other people in hearing distance as to how they should behave. Televisions and radios were shut off. Depending on the time of day, children were taken outside or to other rooms where they were shushed. It didn't really matter that these precautions were taken to render the vicinity as quiet as possible. It didn't matter because the first thing the person who was handed the receiver did was...shout into it. "HELLO, MOTHER. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE." Why did they do this? Some of them did it because America was more rural then and they had grown up running and yelling and working and playing outside. They were used to arguing baseball rules across a field and calling people to dinner who were in the back forty. The other reason many people shouted was because this was a long distance call. These were not stupid people. They were leading productive lives. They had most likely not seen the highly informative video "How Your Phone Works" but if they'd thought about it they probably grasped the idea that there were wires running into their house and into Mrs. Avery's house and into Mom's house that carried the conversations. Well if everything is being transported by wires then it doesn't really matter how far away the other person is, does it? There are wires here and wires there and it all works the same whether it's Mrs. Avery down the block or Mom in California. Right? Technically, yes. (Of course it also costs a hell of a lot more to talk to Mom in California and to this day I've yet to have anyone explain that to me in a satisfactory manner.) But in practice, no. The further away the other person was the louder you had to shout. I'm reminded of those earlier headier days of phone usage whenever I'm out in public but especially when I cross the river and visit the more sophisticated city of Portland. Portland, after all, is bleeding edge. Nike is there. IT firms are there. They had a plan to free wi-fi for the whole city . Portlanders know their technology. You can figure I was surprised then when I realized how many Portlanders were shouting into their cellphones. Whether they're leading productive lives or not these people are stupid. This is 2008 not 1968 and I have different expectations for people's behavior and their understanding of how things work. We have all seen enough news stories about overheard/intercepted cell phone calls to get that conversations are transmitted over radio waves and you don't need to shout just because there isn't a wire running out the end of your phone. (If you want to learn about the beginnings of wireless communication- Hey! You might find it interesting- you can read about the Alohanet here.) I don't think lack of knowledge about how cellphones work is what is causing most people to shout into them. I think it's caused by stupidity. I really believe people are shouting into their phones because they're too ignorant to realize they're trying to use the phone in the wrong place. Not wrong because it's offensive although sometimes that's also true. Wrong because there are environmental factors preventing the phone from fulfilling its purpose of enabling communication. You've probably seen these people. (If you were one of these people I doubt you would have read this far.) In an elevator, descending in a parking garage built by someone whose sideline was fashioning fall-out shelters :(spoken loudly) "Yes, I'm on my way to the car now." Another floor down and the thick walls and wiring interfere: (as if speaking to someone who's old or a non-native speaker of English) "I said I'm in an elevator and I'm on the way to the car. Can you hear me? I. AM. IN. AN. ELEVATOR!" One floor below the sign reading "Abandon all hope..." but the phone user hasn't: (in a voice used for calling "Chow's on" to the back forty) "Can you hear me? Hello? Hello! I was in an elevator?" Shakes phone. (This works for remotes and flashlights but I've never seen it work with a phone.) "Screw it! I'll have to drive over and do this in person". But these were not the stupidest people I saw. That dubious honor goes to the folks who were walking beside the Max train talking on their cellphones. They had the phone up to one ear and they would put their fingers in or hand over their other ear- the one closest to the train tracks- in an attempt to block out the noise and continue the conversation. Unless you're negotiating a hostage situation, an organ transplant, or a way to make people stop knitting or crocheting those Martha Stewart "Freedom" ponchos then there is no reason not to stop and continue your conversation somewhere and somewhen else. After all, at this point it seems to be consisting of "Talk louder! I can't hear you! I'm walking beside an effing train trying to shout over it! What? Because I'm completely stupid!" Okay. Maybe that last was really just editorializing on my part. I can't be sure though. It's hard to hear well when you're standing beside an effing train. Quotidian Economics I have recently become friends with one of the young men in one of my computer classes. I'm not sure how young as he says his birthdate is the equivalent of a state secret and he has had to kill people to protect it. On the other hand, he is young enough not to recognize that "Say 'Good night' Dick" is a reference to Dick Martin of "Laugh-In" as opposed to Dick Cavett the talk show host. (Does anyone besides me remember the series of comedy shows Dick Cavett put together for radio? I heard them on the Armed Forces Radio Network but they had to have started out somewhere else first.) , He wears a lot of message T-shirts with sayings on them like "I won't lower my standards to raise yours". He's one of those intense people who feels that everyone should be learning philosophy and that philosophy should be the basis for a civilization. "If only people thought more about what they're doing and why, the world would be a much better place," he told me today. "If people treated one another fairly and ethically, there would be peace and everyone would get along." "Do you know why more people don't study philosophy?" I said. "No." "I took a class years ago that explained that people didn't even consider things like 'What am I doing' and 'Why am I doing it' until society was sufficiently industrialized that it could afford a leisure class. Most people then and I happen to think most people now as well were too busy trying to get by, trying to eke out a living. But then again it depends on what you mean by philosophy, doesn't it?" "Are you saying people are too busy studying economics to study philosophy?" "I'm saying that if you're living hand to mouth and you can barely feed your family or if that's your perception then you're probably not thinking about why you're doing something. One reason you're not thinking about it is that the answer is obvious: you're doing what you can and what you need to do to acquire food and shelter and clothing for the people who are your responsibility. You're not worried about the people outside your circle because it's someone else's job to look after them. During the Irish Potato Famine there were probably very few people sitting around saying, "Does everything work towards the common good in this world?" "That's just it though," he said. "There was no potato famine". It is at this point that- in the words of Lynne Truss- "I start making pointed harrumphing noises". I am pretty familiar with historical revisionists. I once visited the concentration camp at Dachau and the Lyndon Laroushe people had set up a table outside the gates. Clearly they had not been inside the gates because even if you wrote the facility off as an elaborate hoax you would at least have to wonder why anyone would put so much time and effort into staging it. I believe that wondering is only a short nudge from believing and what I saw at Dachau was beyond even the talents of Disney or George Lucas to contrive. "How can you say there was no potato famine? Why would all the historians say there was one and why would all those Irish people have emigrated to American and wherever else?" "There wasn't really a famine. Yes, the potato crop was smaller than usual but there would have been enough for the Irish if they were only supporting themselves. The problem is that the Irish were supposed to be supplying potatoes for all of England too. When the English arrived to pick up the potatoes, the Irish people told them there weren't enough and they couldn't supply the English and feed themselves. The English then took all of the potatoes and the other crops too and the chickens and goats and children to use as slaves and their daughters and packed everything/everyone off to England." "Okay..." "So that's it. If the English had treated the Irish with respect and left them enough food to eat then there wouldn't have been a famine at all." "Right..." "I don't get it. Everybody studies math and science and nobody studies philosophy. Why is that?" "Because you don't make any money with philosophy. We still live in a bottom-line type society. You make money by using math and science to invent or develop something. You don't make money being nice to people and explaining to other people why they should be nice to each other." "I guess that's true. Do you think that's why there's such an emphasis on math and science?" "I'm probably not a good person to ask. When I was in elementary school, we were all pushed as fast and as hard as we could be to learn math and science so we could defeat the Russians. Math, science, and chess." "Oh, the old Space Race thing." "Yes, and we weren't going to beat the Russians by sitting around coming up with ways to be nice. And Bill Gates didn't get to be a billionaire by thirty-one by being nice either. He made a billion dollars and then he started giving it away. Ethics and respect for other people are fine in personal relationships but I've never heard of anyone using them to get ahead. You can be as kind and respectful as you want in your cardboard box under the bridge." The conversation moved on then to why people don't follow Bill and Ted's advice to "Be excellent to each other" and why nearly forty years after the attempted introduction of the metric system it still isn't dominant in American society. "Umm... because we're Americans and we're still a super-power so we'll use any damned measurement system we like and to hell with what the rest of the world is doing" was my take on the reason. In some ways I hate having those kinds of conversations with younger people. I always feel like I'm letting them down and letting myself down as well. I understand that I'm just presenting to them the facts as I've experienced them. (Do I wish things were different? You bet your sweet bippy! I'd love to buy the world a Coke and keep it company.) More and more frequently unless someone asks me specifically I just let them proceed in ignorance. Yes, someone at some point is going to shake them by the scruff of the neck and tell them it's a dirty old world and most people would sell their mother or one of their children to make a buck or to get a carton of cigarettes. But I no longer think it is my job to do the shaking and I would rather do them the kindness of maintaining their innocence as long as possible. Relapse Sometimes when you're suffering from an addiction it seems as if you're the only one and it's kind of nice to find out you're not. Maybe calling it an addiction is too strong. Maybe " obsession " would be better. " Affection " isn't big enough for the things I'm going to be discussing. It's a good word for a phase you'll grow out of like thinking life will end if you don't end up married to Kevin Spacey , Kevin Kline or Les McKeown .( Alan Rickman isn't on that list because no matter how increasingly shabby he looks as Severus Snape he will always be entrancing in " An Awfully Big Adventure ".) People also don't seem to grow out of their desire to own a lot of Sharpie pens . Once you have the regular thickness in all the different colors you can start on the ones with "fine" on one end and "ultra fine" on the other. Sometimes they make good souvenirs; I once bought four of them at a stationery store at the beach and gave them to appropriate people along with their back-story. (Could we have bought the same ones at the Office Max here in town ? No. They would have been the same color but they wouldn't have traveled three hours in a bag with a Cannon Beach sweatshirt and some salt water taffy and that makes all the difference.) It's hard to set someone on the path to Sharpie love though. You can give someone a Sharpie and they will either squee and their eyes will light up or they will say,"Oh. A marker"and it's hard to tell which ahead of time. Another perennial favorite for unpredictable responses- I thought I had grown out of this one but apparently not- is fonts . Not fountains . Not those things they baptize babies and sometimes larger humans in. The typographic kind you find in books, magazines, and web designers' caches. I have not designed in years therefore I had not come into contact with font collections online therefore I thought the danger was past. Then I read " The Principles of Beautiful Web Design " and there was a chapter on typography and even
worse there were links . Now I have three different fonts of various sorts of hearts and a font that looks like stamps and a handwritten font called "Rhiannon" has found its way back onto my computer. Sock yarn , coffee , baseball , books, Sharpie pens, Alan Rickman, jewelry-making supplies , cheese, and now fonts. At least I'm over the guy down the hall. Right? A bit old (and out of shape) to be a home-wrecker Robert Cray did an outstanding song about a couple in the apartment next-door who get into an argument about her being unfaithful. Their disagreement is especially poignant for the narrator because the woman has been unfaithful and it was with him. My situation is a lot less extreme but I want to apologize now to the gentleman who sat beside me yesterday for the long disagreeable night I'm anticipating he had. Especially because the whole incident was completely unintentional. I am not a young person. I have a lot of fun. I usually have a lot of energy. I am wearing an oversized Ichiro T-shirt , rubber flip-flops, jeans that drag the ground, and two rubber bracelets (that support prostate cancer research ) but I don't really look young. I have crow's feet and parentheses and frown lines on my face. More weight than I'd like has moved from my bust to my waist. You get the idea: not young. But even when I was a younger person I never had the problem of girls being upset if I talked to their boyfriends. We were usually talking about cars or sports or Dungeons and Dragons and the girls would give me the once-over and mentally- at least- say "Yeah, right". I haven't expected this to change any time soon. Girls tend to see me as one of the guys and guys tend to see me as one of the guys and that's okay. Whether it makes me one of the guys or not, I love baseball . I don't know when I started to love baseball. I was listening to an audiobook about Spenser and he was reciting the names of the Impossible Dream 1967 Red Sox and they floated to the top layer of my brain like long-forgotten friends. I don't know why my father would have been a Red Sox fan and I would only have been six-years-old when these guys played which makes it very odd I would have the players' names filed away. Clearly baseball has been with me for a long time. (I don't play baseball or softball. My hand-eye coordination sucks and I have either asthma or COPD so at this time I am purely a spectator and commentator.) And if people appear to be spectating with me I will talk to them about baseball. Anyone. And they only have to look like they're the tiniest amount interested in the game. I offer as evidence the fact I once spent twenty minutes explaining to my mother about a ground-rule double. My mother is a) a 70 year old woman, b) only remotely interested in sports and that goes double for baseball, and c) usually doing something else and listening to me purely because I am her offspring. Yesterday evening I attended the Vintage Baseball game held at the Fo rt on the field not too far from the gazebo. They play in the uniforms of and use the rules of the early 1860's. This means no bunting, no sliding, no stealing, no called strikes, no called balls so no walks, and no gloves. Also the ball must be thrown underhand. I arrived at the field with my blanket and my sweatshirt rolled into a ball and was able to find a good seat even though there were a lot of people and the game had already started. I plopped down next to an old man- not being ageist. He was at least seventy-five. Not as elderly-looking as the seeming centenarian who later got hit by a foul ball but still old- who was sitting in one of those very short lawn chairs. I pulled out my BlackBerry, started getting some pictures and trying to understand the rules. I'm not sure if he talked to me first or if I talked to him first. I have feeling it was me and I asked him something like "Do you think those bats are made of hickory ?" My daughter had sent me a link to an article on why baseball bats break and it mentioned that in the early days the bats were made of hickory and since this was supposedly the early days I thought it was a reasonable question. (No, I don't know why I thought he might have an opinion. Maybe because he was an old man and they seem to have an opinion on everything except what they want for their next meal.)He said he thought they might be and we started talking about why bats break and how players like Ichiro who keep their bats in humidity controlled conditions don't break their bats. And then we talked about baseball in general and how the Mariners are doing and whether they will turn out to be the reincarnation of the 1914 Braves and how the Portland Beavers are doing and in between all this talking- which was spread over six innings- we sat in companionable silence that was only broken by exclamations of "Nice hit" or "He batted from the other side of the plate last time. He might want to consider going back to it". The reader can easily gather from this bare-bones recounting of our interaction that nothing untoward was said by either the old man or me. There was nothing, in fact, that could not have been broadcast as "color" during this particular game had there been color announcers at that time or announcers of any kind. I had noticed that every so often the old man would exchange a remark or two with the old woman in the chair ahead of him. A lot of people were exchanging remarks with other people though and the two of them weren't in matching chairs or anything so what happened around the middle of the sixth inning came as a big surprise. (My mother claims it shouldn't have but she wasn't there so it's all supposition on her part.) What happened was that the people directly ahead of me had brought their two children and the kids got increasingly restless and the parents had already bribed them with soda and hot dogs and Cracker Jack and decided finishing the game wasn't worth any further monetary investment. So they left. This was an awesome development for me because I now had an unobstructed view of the field even when I was sitting rather than kneeling. The parents and children leaving wasn't a wholly unexpected event. The unexpected thing was when the old lady called over her shoulder, in the manner of one of the wives on " Last of the Summer Wine ", "Well, now that there's room...I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me." No response from the old man. Presumably he was focusing on the game. "Did you hear me?" The old man's head slowly swiveled from the runner on second trying to decide whether he could make it to third once the ball was struck before the ball bounced. "What did you say?" A bit louder this time- "Now that there's room I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me ." "I suppose I could." "Yes... I suppose you could ." The old man moved up and as soon as he was settled in she left to get a hot dog. By now it was the seventh-inning stretch- no singing, of course, as that portion of the stretch hadn't been inaugurated yet- and I went up to have a better look at some of the bats. Because the old man and I had been discussing them earlier, I said to him as I walked by in search of my own hot dog, "He said his bats are made of white Ash wood and there was no weight limit but there was a circumference limit and the length limit was 42". Can you imagine how tall you'd have to be?" "You'd have to be a basketball player! No limit for weight though?" "No limit on what?" asked the old woman returned from her successful mission. "No limit on weight," he said. "Hmm..." she said. It was very apparent now that I was the third wheel on a tandem although she was displaying as much interest in the whole topic as my mother had in the ground-rule double and I departed on a hot-dog recon of my own. When I came back to the game I sat facing the other side of the field. I hadn't seen the action from over there and I thought it was the better part of valor even though it had never been my intention to cause trouble. But why was there going to be trouble? I had no interest in hooking up with the old man. He was a nice enough old man with some good baseball stories to tell but even if I were looking for a sugar daddy he didn't look like he had the makings of one. And if I were an old woman I can't imagine why I would be jealous of my old man talking to someone like me. No one would consider me trophy wife or girlfriend material. I hope the old man didn't get in trouble. I hope he had a good time watching the game. And I hope this experience doesn't put him off talking to other people. They could learn a lot from him. Even if all they talk about is baseball. Now I've got the pill My doctor looked at me from under her straight-across black bangs, her eyes serious behind her silver wire-framed glasses. "The fact is your cholesterol is sky-high , my friend." "Yeah, well I'm cutting back on the cheese like the nurse said." The doctor's hair swayed as she gave her head a quick shake. "Your cholesterol is so high I can tell there's no way you're going to be able to bring it down with a low-fat diet. I'm going to put you on Zocor ." Ah, the old good news-bad news situation. The good news is since we're not going to try to reduce the cholesterol by cutting the fat I can still enjoy cheese (occasionally). The bad news is- with the exception of the mental anguish caused by contemplating a life without cheese - I was a lot more comfortable with the idea of lowering my LDL by diet and force of will than taking another pill. I am thankful that someone invented this pill and it's going to help prevent atherosclerosis and a possible heart attack . Don't get me wrong about that. But I've been adding more and more pills to my life in the last few years and Zocor like Prozac is going to be something I'm on for the foreseeable future. (In the interest of full-disclosure, when I received my first prescription for Prozac two years ago I was extremely happy. It's goofy, I know, but I am very proud of my identity as a trailing Baby Boomer and in my mind having to take Prozac solidified my membership in that group . A doctor later diagnosed me as having an "attachment disorder" which essentially means I have a hard time accepting that we're all getting older , my child is going to go to college then off to start her own life , my parents are eventually going to die, and even more eventually so will I and the world will just continue on as if none of these events amounted to a hill of beans. Aside from personally finding this line of thought depressing as hell , I think most Baby Boomers have suffered or are now suffering from some form of attachment disorder. Come on... The only way you can unironically say, "Never trust anyone over thirty" is to ignore the fact that someday you'll be there yourself .) Besides- and this is probably the crux of the issue- Zocor is something my pop takes. And he's diabetic . And seriously overweight. And seventy-one. What the hell am I doing having to take the same medication as him? The short answer is it's his fault. Actually it's his parents' fault. Okay, it's probably their parents' fault too. In other words, I'm one of those cholesterol from " apple pie and Grandpa Si " people just like in the commercial. Come to think of it, most of the people on his side of the family suffered from some form of anxiety or depression too. As I look at the state he's in and consider whether his fate might be my own in twenty-five years, it appears having an attachment disorder and- as my mother puts it- railing against the advance of the years might not be a bad idea. The title of this entry is taken from a song by Loretta Lynn . She was filled with unalloyed joy at getting the pill because it was, in fact, The Pill . i'm not lovin' it We've had a bit of a heat wave this week and with that and the price of gas being so high we've all been driving as little as possible. That's why even though my mother wanted fruit and yogurt parfaits from McDonalds she hesitated to text me to ask if I'd stop and get some. I arrived at her house around ten after ten and she made the request in person. I said, "Sure" cuz I don't mind driving when it's hot; I put the windows down and turn the radio up and everything's fine. Our local oldies station is playing their way through their library from A to Z and it's been fun discovering and rediscovering songs. So I absolutely did not mind making a Mickey Ds run. Until I got there. You probably noted the time I arrived at Mom's- even if only subconsciously- and you probably know that McDonalds stops serving breakfast at 10:30. (I don't know why 10:30 is the magic time but it appears to be universal except for Jack In The Box .) So I pulled quickly into the drive-through lane and looked at the clock and it was 10:20 and yes that's damn fast driving but please don't snitch me off. I ordered the six fruit and yogurt parfaits and the Sausage McMuffin with no meat and the iced coffee and since it was now 10:22 I put in my order for the three Filet O' Fish sandwiches. "We don't start serving lunch until 10:30." "Okay." "It's not 10:30 yet so you can't order the sandwiches." "I don't think I'm understanding this right. Are you telling me I can order all the other stuff now but I have to come back through to order the fish sandwiches even though 10:30 is only eight minutes away?" "No lunch until after 10:30." I pulled up to the first window and gave someone the money then I drove to the second window and received six fruit and yogurt parfaits and a Sausage McMuffin with no meat. Then- because I have clearly been beaten down by years of bureaucrats . I parked and sat and enjoyed the moderately pleasant breeze and listened to the radio until...10:35. At which time I got back into the drive-through lane, ordered iced coffee and three Filet O' Fish sandwiches, pulled up to the first window, gave someone my money, pulled up to the second window and waited. I waited sixteen minutes for them to finish cooking some "fresh" fish for me. Are you seeing the irony in this timing? Later my mother said, "You can't blame them; it's how they're trained." I do understand that. I'm not talking about blaming anyone. I also comprehend that there are occupations which call for precision. If someone was say wiring my house I'd want them to pay exacting attention to the codes. Same goes for someone performing surgery on me or someone I love. And, yes, if you start making exceptions for one person then theoretically everyone else will want to order their Filets O' Fish early. That's "theoretically" because I've never seen the world start down the slippery slope to Hades when I've made exceptions and other people do it so seldomly I can't claim to have enough experience to draw a conclusion. It's just like that poem by Charles Bukowski. I enjoy being the girl Many many years ago when computers took up a whole room and John Denver was popular (and alive) and Mt. Saint Helens had yet to erupt, I took computer classes. I studied Basic and Fortran and played Dungeons and Dragons and spent hours working my way through the caves of the Adventure game. In January of this year, I started taking computer classes again. I had already spent over a hundred hours beta-testing interactive fiction a few summers ago. I had spent many happy afternoons singing folk songs. (And even writing some songs of my own). I had not resumed my playing of D&amp;D but otherwise I guess you could say my re-enrolling in computer classes was just the next step in my progression. Most of my classes have a mix of males and females in them. That's different. Ten years ago I took a class in Microsoft Office applications and there was only one male; the rest were women in their fifties and sixties who were only there because their boss made them be and were terribly afraid to shut down the computer for fear the data would disappear as soon as it left the
Sorry today's post is late today, I fell asleep on the couch last night while watching TV, and woke up late this morning, too late to do my nails before work. SOOOOO you get after-work nails!! YAYYYYY! Tonight I get to make Guinness Chocolate Cupcakes for St. Pat's Day tomorrow!!! They're delish!! MMMM. I used MAC Blue India, the gorgeous new color from their Liberty of London Collection as a base, with Sally Hansen All the White Stuff sponged on the tips, and then two layers of Essie Funky Limelight sponged over that! :) Thinking I might drink a Guinness while the cupcakes bake- good idea? I think so. The idea for today's manicure came to me a while ago, and I had it written amongst the ideas in my notebook. I think when I originally thought of the idea, I envisioned the cage black, but I think this way works too! :) I used Orly Snowcone as a base, with American Apparel Manila for the yellow birds, and China Glaze Salsa over Sally Hansen All the White Stuff for the red birds. American Apparel Hassid for the legs and the eyes, and China Glaze 2030 from Khrome Collection for the birdcages. Today's nails are simple, bread class wears me out, so I usually don't have much time to paint my nails before I fall into a bread class induced coma. I did, however, get a chance to use my new American Apparel Office polish that I got the other day. This polish, sadly, was less than stellar. The color is amaaaaazing, but it took 3, and probably should've used 4, coats to have full coverage, a far cry from my beloved 1-coat Hassid. Seems like the AA polishes are hit-and-miss pigment-wise. They're all great great great colors, but some are vastly more pigmented than others. Anyway. I used American Apparel Office as a base, with China Glaze Millennium applied with Konad Plate m63. Topped everything off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat. Hey all! Today's manicure was inspired by a set of notecards that I found in the $1 section of Target!! I love graphic prints, and one of my favorite color combos is aqua and chocolate brown...soooo... here you go! The inspiration: The nails: I used China Glaze For Audrey as a base, with Nubar Milk Chocolate Creme for the dots and lines. Topped it all off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat. (Kinda makes it look like they're wrapped in cellophane, like the notecards!! :-P Hey all!!! Today's mani is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. :-D For the accent nail I did the iconic Hitchcock profile graphic. :-) A better view of the profile: I used American Apparel Cotton as a base on all the bird nails, and American Apparel Hassid for the Hitchcock nail, as well as the birds. I seriously can't get the Hitchcock intro music out of my head. Hey all!! Just a note to let you know that Vincent Longo stuff is on Hautelook today and this weekend. everything is 65% off!!! There are lipsticks, lip pencils, eye shadows, eye liners, colored mascaras, bronzers. lipglosses, etc. CHEAP!! Hautelook Ok, not sure what inspired this, but I thought of it as I was falling asleep last night. I'm glad I remembered this morning when I set out to paint my nails. :-P Just something simple, but recognizable (I hope? :-P) I used American Apparel Hassid as a base, with Pure Ice Wild Thing and Nubar Forest mixed for the heart monitor line. Topped it off with only one coat of Seche Vite top coat, since I was in a hurry! Hey all!! Jumping on the Ruffian-inspired manicure bandwagon. I instantly loved those nails when I saw them, and all the interpretations I've seen lately were lovely and made me want to try my own, with my own twist. I used China Glaze Ruby Pumps as a base, and then freehanded the black with my newest love, American Apparel Hassid, using the brush from the bottle. The black is ONE coat. Seriously. I'm in awe of this polish. I topped it off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat.
Kiwi sullo stecco , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . With Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign to promote a healthier way of nourishing our kids, it almost looks as if McDonald's in Italy has taken a step forward and jumped on the health wagon too. How about kiwi on a stick? Not such a terrible idea right? Individually wrapped kiwi sullo stecco (not the one shown here, that was my idea) will be available from March 9th to May 24th at the cost of 1€ each. I already pride myself in eating 5 or more servings of fresh fruit and vegetables each day - the habit sort of stuck after seeing how my inlaws serve a big bowl of fruit after the Sunday meal. All that snow last Wednesday? Pfffffft! Gone in 2 days like some flailing lightweight when the sun blew into town. By Friday it was a definite go for spring hiking conditions anywhere on a south-facing trail, and this is a fairly easy one (ascent of 317 meters) that I suggest if you're not afraid of the woods. I felt as if someone was watching me... All kidding aside, there is, or there should be, an area along the path where carved wooden creatures exist in il Sentiero dello Spirito del Bosco (the path of the spirit of the woods). Well, not that I was expecting an Ent-like entity to walk up and start shaking my hand or anything, but we didn't see friendly tree people and probably walked right past in our quest to reach that steaming bowl of polenta and cheese at the end of the road. I suspect that if we had explored the large picnic area at the first stop/info point, this guy with the owl may have willingly posed for my lens. Photo: www.flickr.com/photos/finny1975 / CC BY-SA 2.0 Getting there The trailhead to Rifugio Terz'Alpe is a short distance from Canzo at the end of via Gaium [B] , but we kept seeing "no entry/parking" signs like these on the way up and thought better to park at the designated areas for visitors [A] . Upon reaching Canzo, look for the "P" on brown street signs to Gajum - ample parking where via Rimembranze and via Gasperi intersect at the cemetary. From there it's only about a 20-minute walk on paved road (uphill of course!) with easy-to-spot GAJUM signs pointing the way. I imagine that this trail is quite popular with families, hikers with dogs, and nature lovers of all ages, thus the need to restrict traffic on weekends when everyone escapes to the mountains to let loose in the woods. To Rifugio Terz'Alpe This can be enjoyed as a loop trail - percorso ad anello - tackling thigh-busting Via Per le Alpi on the left and returning by way of Via San Miro. The path initially zigzags through peaceful forest on sun-dappled stones, arriving at the first rest point/info center (40 minutes) where I missed seeing the wood sculptures. From this point, Rifugio Terze'Alpe is a half hour away on flat terrain. The return on via San Miro takes about 45 minutes. The food There is nothing like a rustic, hearty meal of polenta taragna (corn and buckwheat polenta), pizzoccheri and cheese made on the premises . Add to that a quarter liter of cheap, local wine and you're set for the lazy stroll back home. The total came to 22€ for 3 plates - cheap! No credit cards or receipt given (i.e. they don't pay taxes???) the Little Red Man said Snow , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . A little late, but this is the snow that we had anticipated for our bagna cauda feast this past Sunday. I'm not complaining. You can never trust the weatherman these days anyway.. Later in the day... CaTcH Me iF U cAn - VROOOOOSHH!!! I ain't no TURTLE Now while many fans appreciate the presence of Clooney in Italia (the actor is a consummate showman), I have often wondered if he ever learned to pick up the language. Whenever he's on italian news it seems to me that reporters always speak to him in english, and of course the media need only call out his name to snap that news-breaking shot. What, he's been in this country for like 7 years or so? Well, for the first time ever I find George saying more than just “ciao”, because at 0:23 he says “Come stai” How are you? That's a start. Pulcinella , originally uploaded by latigi / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Voi avete chiesto and I found an answer. Carnevale in Italy may be over for this year, but the information I've recently come across is too useful to wait until the next. Ever wondered who were all of those masked characters during carnevale festivities? I think everyone will easily recognize Arlecchino (the Harlequin), but there are many, many disguised personalities who make up the Commedia dell'arte theater of mid-15th century Italy. I had no idea of the total count until my trusted source of italian trivia (that's my husband aka Man-of-the-House or MotH) found a site that details a long list which also includes characters particular to a specific region. The main page is in italian, but if you click on the names at right, there are both italian and english descriptions. Link: SIPARIO Radio Arlecchino And while we're on the topic of masked persons, I strongly suggest this italian grammar website for intermediate students. Learning the passato prossimo (present perfect), passato remoto (past absolute), imperfetto (imperfect) and other verb tenses can be a real pain, but Radio Arlecchino employs an engaging teaching method that involves a few Commedia dell'Arte characters, thus making learning those wretched conjugations fun, if not easier, to grasp. Free pdf transcripts and mp3 audio files are available for download by clicking on the Podcasts link in the navigation bar. They haven't updated since the beginning of December, but what lessons they do have are worth looking into. Photo credit: www.flickr.com/photos/abels / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Hot.... bath ....anchovies... butter ...olive oil....and lots and lots of garlic . Yesterday's snow didn't fall in the chestnut forest like it was supposed to, but I'd be interested to know what the odds are that someone, somewhere, decided to chase the chill by jumping right into a bubbling pot of bagna cauda like that above. Not literally, of course, even though it takes a cast iron stomach and nerves of steel to be able to properly enjoy this potent piemontese specialty. Also spelled bagna caoda (BAHN-yah COW-dah), this "bath hot" is a simple country dish that gathers the bestest of friends when the first nip of autumn hits the air. I've been to one such party in Piemonte years ago and it lasted more than 4 hours, stretching well beyond the midnight hour in a daze of drunken garlic breath and laughter. We have never been able to organize a party at ours because we just don't know of anyone in town who loves garlic and anchovy to the point of reeking for a worthy cause. Do you? Bagna Cauda for two, just tell me quando quando quando Because the season for this dish is soon to end. And while I can't say it was Fergie's vocals to get things on a roll, yesterday was as good a time as any to perfume the house. Some cooks will suggest soaking the garlic in milk in order to take away some of the bite, but I prefer to skip this step and tackle bagna cauda head on. The most important thing is to cook the sauce on VERY low heat, even if this means standing at the stove and moving your pot on and off the fire to prevent the garlic from browning. Brown garlic = bitter. Not good. For a party of 2 you will need: • 6 large cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin • 1/4 cup butter • 4-6 anchovy fillets (I use the ones in oil), chopped • 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil • assorted cooked vegetables: topinambur , cardoon , cauliflower, beets, grilled onions • assorted fresh vegs/fruits: endive, cherry tomatoes, celery sticks, bell peppers, pears Instructions : Gently melt the butter and add the garlic slices, cooking on a very low flame until softened. Add the anchovies and olive oil. Continue to cook gently until the anchovies fall apart. Remove from heat. If you prefer a smooth sauce, process briefly with a handheld blender. To serve, pour sauce into individual fojòt like the ones below, or keep warm in a fondue-style dish in the center of the table. Pile up the vegetable platters and pour the wine. Vegetable platter, cured meats (prosciutto, lardo and speck), and lots of bread. Another reason to love bagna cauda - dipping your food. Forks optional. And for Gemini's like me who just want it all because we can't make up our minds. The table is never complete without affettati and olives. “Mmmmm... beeeeeer” , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . Blech! Maybe because I made a wrong move in trying this with gorgonzola-potato focaccia and shichimi togarashi chicken sticks. Or perhaps it's the fault of my diminished senses due to a rotten cold, but this beer tastes just shy (sniffs deeply from an empty bottle) of donkey piss. Mind you, that's saying what I would imagine donkey pee to taste like, but after having enjoyed some terrific brews of all colors and flags, the only thing worth mentioning about Duff is the cute label. MotH said something like “Beck's with a sweet aftertaste”. I couldn't even go more than half a glass, it was that bad. Cheap pilsener at an inflated price. Produced in Germany, this is &#252;ber highway robbery no matter what they say. Simpsonophiles, take note: a 6-pack cost us 17€ worth of donuts. That's just a little over 23 bucks. Doh! You ask and I answer. And to set the record straight, it is NOT “Ciao il mio nome è...” Chiamare | to call I know I'm not the first to say that a little goes a long way in trying to communicate in a foreign language, but when introducing yourself in italian, it's as simple as 3 words plus your name. Example: Ciao, mi chiamo Rowena (informal) or Salve, mi chiamo Rowena (formal). Literally it translates to Hi, myself I call Rowena , but once you get the hang of the syntax it becomes easier. Of course after you've introduced yourself, you'll want to ask the other person's name. What is your name? Come ti chiami? | KOH-meh tee kee-AH-mee (informal) Literally, How to you/yourself you call? What is your name? Come si chiama? | KOH-meh see kee-AH-mah (formal) This is the polite form used when speaking to strangers or persons of authority. What is his / her / its name? Come si chiama? (Note the example answers given) His name is Peter. Si chiama Pietro. Her name is Mary. Si chiama Maria. Its name is Cousin Itt. Si chiama Cugino Itt. Italian verbs become even more interesting when used as an imperative or urgent request: Call the police! Chiama la polizia! Don't call the police! Non chiamare la polizia! And then it gets downright confusing when the english-to-italian translation requires a different word to express something correctly. For us, call has a broader meaning but in italian, it's necessary to use a new verb/word altogether: • I will call you back in a few minutes. Ti richiamo tra un paio di minuti. ( richiamare = to call back) • It's not nice to call a person names . Non è carino canzonare le persone. ( canzonare = to tease) • Call your sisters to dinner! Di' alle tue sorelle di venire a cena! (imperative) Literally, Tell to your sisters to come to dinner. The imperative for dire | DEE-reh (to tell) has a slanted dot above the letter "i". Dì la verita! Tell the truth! That's it for today, I'm calling it quits.
Website: www.livraineysmith.com Etsy: raineysmith.etsy.com , lovecraftian.etsy.com Brief Bio Printmaker Liv Rainey-Smith works with woodblocks to create richly colored prints. Her process incorporates a mixture of traditional and modern tools as well as a blend of European and Japanese printmaking technique. She draws upon history, nature, religion, dream, and vision for inspiration. How did you get started in printmaking? I needed some more "secondary craft" credits as part of my degree requirements. Printmaking caught my eye because it was taught by Brian Shannon and I was curious about the process. Little did I know I'd be lured away from my primary craft (metals) and into the world of print. Describe where you work. I do my sketching anywhere and everywhere, I make sure to take my sketchbook whenever I might have some quiet time. Most of my carving is done in my home office on a small desk. I prefer solitude for carving and need to take periodic stretch breaks, being at home gives me plenty of other small tasks to break up the work and still feel productive. My office is a bit cluttered, with a full bookshelf, CD rack, two computers and desks, a rolling steel rack loaded with supplies, and a tank housing our pet mice. For the actual printing I'm a member of Atelier Meridian . The Atelier offers plenty of work space, several presses to chose from, and good company. What's your favorite printmaking process? Woodblock with oil-based ink. I'm particularly fond of reduction printing, though I've primarily focused on single-color prints this year. I enjoy strong solid colors and thick papers that take embossing. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) My process varies. My thesis, The Four Portlanders of the Apocalypse , was highly planned. I spent months developing the concept, taking photos of locations around Portland, drawing, and testing out the sizes of various elements on photocopiers. The finished designs were transferred to the blocks using carbon paper, and then I carved all four concurrently. My current series, the Iunges , has been much more free-flowing. I start directly on the block, spending time looking at the grain, then sketching the outline of the Iunge. I make a few guidelines as the carving progresses, but for the most part the details are not drawn out first. I've found this technique very liberating since woodblock tends to be a very rigid medium. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? I love being able to make two-dimensional art using three dimensional means. I've always been more comfortable with mediums that require a certain amount of force and control. Metalsmithing was actually the focus of my education and taught me a great deal about precision. Ultimately though, I found the prospect of making the same pieces of jewelry over and over again unappealing. Printmaking has the advantage of allowing the production of editions without the same level of tedium. What's your least favorite part of the process? Cutting paper and mats. It is exacting and not very exciting work. I also have trouble photographing my own work as well as I'd like to, and job that out whenever possible. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? As a child I went through the period of fascination with dinosaurs most kids seem to go through, but then I also got into ancient Egypt, the Aztecs, Hopi and Zuni lore, and natural history. My interest in historical art and cultures has continued on through adulthood, so it can be a bit difficult to pinpoint my influences. Some of my earliest print works are clearly influenced by particular cultures, but as my work has continued the connections have become less apparent. Dream has also been a very large part of my creative life. I remember my dreams from every night, so the often non-sensible scenarios and beings I encounter within them are to me, normal. As important as rational thought is, I believe it is important to maintain a sense of wonder and awe. This will be a sad world indeed if we ever succeed in banishing all of the angels, devils, and bogeys from our minds. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? My first prints as a student were technical exercises. Not terribly creative, but very exciting to me as I could see the door to a new world of art opening up. Technically I see great improvement in my carving, even from the work I did a year ago. Familiarity with the tools and techniques of woodblock has allowed me to start experimenting more. I've been letting go of some of my rigid notions of how things "must" be, and allowed myself to work more freely. How do you get past creative slumps? When my cup of ideas runneth over, I lament my lack of time to pursue each idea fully, and sketch them out for future dry spots. When concept begins to weigh me down, I let myself just have some fun. Not every piece needs to have a deep meaning behind it. When I'm feeling a bit lost, trying out different block sizes has also proved fruitful. I followed up the largest blocks I've ever carved with the smallest I've yet carved. The transition from large to small was a fantastic mental exercise. How do you promote your work? I keep my business card in my wallet and car so I've got it to hand out any time I run into someone interested or interesting. I also apply for juried shows and send show announcements to my alma mater. Art and craft events can be good for creating visibility, and conferences have proven excellent for making professional contacts. I use Etsy, Facebook (via a fanpage and a personal page for friends), and my website. I also have a blog but I've not really set it up yet. I'm not fond of sitting down to write long entries. I much prefer sharing photos with little bites of info. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Take a survey class if you can. You never know what technique you might fall in love with until you try it, and a bit of hands-on guidance can make intimidating processes more approachable. Be prepared for some failures, but don't let them stop you.

How did you get started in printmaking? Studied printmaking in college as a minor, I was a painting major. Describe where you work. I do my etching work at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where besides teaching, I monitor the Wednesday night access studio. I do my screenprinting work at my shop, usually when the commercial work slows down a bit. What's your favourite printmaking process? Currently I'd have to say etching. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) I use a photo-transfer process for my etchings. Starting with a photo which I've taken, I scan it, and print it out on my laser printer, then using a solvent, transfer the toner from the paper to a zinc plate. The toner acts as a resist when the plate is etched in nitric acid. After the initial etch, traditional etching techniques such as aquatint, scraping and burnishing, etc. are used to complete the image. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? I enjoy the mystery and surprises that come about from the indirectness of the process. Acid does what it will do, and sometimes can't be controlled. However you can change it after it's done its thing and mold it that way you want. What's your least favorite part of the process? An image or a plate that refuses to work its way to completion. Happens sometimes. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? I'm a landscape artist and I'm inspired by my visions of nature, and how we humans have interacted with it, and the effects of time and weather on natural and man-made objects. I've been inspired by the prints of Whistler. He was known as kind of a rebel in his time. He was also the first printmaker to start signing his prints in pencil. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? I like to think it's gotten better. But I think I've evolved from a straight landscape artist to one that's making more of a statement about the natural environment as well. How do you get past creative slumps? I get a bunch of plates and start beveling them. I usually try to have my next 5 to 10 images planned out in advance, so I usually don't have slumps. How do you promote your work? I sell in galleries as well as online. I must admit the social networking phenomena has been helpful in getting the word out. I think teaching helps, also I do a lot of demos and lectures for museums, and art groups as well. Getting into juried shows also helps. Anything to get your work and name visible certainly can't hurt. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Try starting with monotypes, which is kind of a hybrid of painting and printmaking, then venture into one of the other processes. Take a class or two to get your feet wet.

How did you get started in printmaking? I took printmaking courses throughout college and was hooked at the start. I was introduced to German Expressionist prints early in my academic career and I still cannot get enough of the work...absolutely powerful. Describe where you work. I work in my home studio. I like to be surrounded by my tools and be able to work on my artwork at any convenient moment. I print on a Dick Blick press which I love! It is very empowering to own your own press and have the opportunity to print whenever you want! What's your favorite printmaking process? I really enjoy intaglio. There are so many techniques that can be utilized to create the final print. I enjoy charting a course on how I want my prints to look in the final stage and then implementing the steps to make it happen. It can be a very time consuming medium but is very much worth the effort in the end. What's your creative process for any given print? (eg. sketch first? Pre-planned or free-form?) I usually begin by writing down ideas that are inspired by a number of stimuli (books, nature, people watching, tv, radio). I then develop my ideas in sketches to work out compositions and subject matter. I also sketch in pen and ink to practice my mark making which I then transfer to the copper plate. An attractive quality to printmaking is in the creation of multiples, so I like to create series of works to further explore the multiple and cover my ideas from different angles. What do you enjoy most about printmaking? Pulling the first print off the press is very exciting. Even though a plate has been worked over for several hours and you have a pretty good idea of what you may get, there are always surprises revealed once the plate is inked and printed. It is really a magical moment. What's your least favorite part of the process? The process of printing an edition of several impressions can be monotonous and time consuming. I am usually at my wits end after cleaning, inking, wiping and printing five impressions of the same image. At this point I walk away, rest and approach the edition with fresh eyes because focus is needed to create a consistent edition. What are your inspirations (other artists, people, places, events, etc.)? Observation of urban and rural nature, people, video, radio and reading books always provide inspiration. Visiting museums and reading about other artist's work and methods of production is also great for fueling the creative fire. How has your work changed and evolved since you started? The quality of idea forming through observation and more playful execution of techniques has increased over the years which has really elevated my work to a more challenging place for me and hopefully the viewer. How do you get past creative slumps? I recognize them and enjoy them. I try to avoid being frustrated and understand that the well will once again fill up. I find these to be great times to look at other artists work, or just take a break and not think about art-making at all. How do you promote your work? I just recently started selling my work on Etsy! I have a website which features my finished works and a blog that I update with sketches and works in progress. I enter competitions once or twice a year and have gallery shows about once every couple of years. Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints? Printmaking can be accomplished with limited means. There are several books out there that illustrate great printmaking techniques that can be accomplished with a few household tools. There is no excuse for not printing! The best thing about prints are the multiples that you can trade for other artist's works! If you could curate a museum show of a printmaker who would you exhibit? I would love to curate a comprehensive exhibition of Goya's prints. The show would include various states of specific prints (if they exist) and original plates, tools and a reproduction of a press that he may have used. Oh yes, and there would be printmaking demonstrations throughout the duration of the exhibition. What printastic museum would you recommend other printmakers to visit? THE REMBRANDT HOUSE MUSEUM They have the MOST comprehensive collection of Rembrandt prints. The house, which Rembrandt owned for many years, has been restored to reflect how Rembrandt lived in it in the 17th century. It is a remarkable experience.

I’ve worked with companies like Marriott, Swissair, Land Rover, the Smithsonian, and Seventeen Magazine, helping to grow market share, increase revenue, and adapt to the ever-changing realities of the digital age. But we all know what they say about "all work and no play..." 
n my spare time, I explore a variety of creative pursuits, including cooking, writing, photography, and printmaking. For more than three years, I assisted classically-trained chefs in teaching recreational cooking classes at L'academie de Cuisine in Bethesda, MD. I’ve also co-authored a number of books and articles on topics ranging from online pricing and distribution models in the music industry to business use of technology, contemporary American politics, travel, and product development. For th e past few years I’ve worked with artists at Washington's Corcoran College of Art + Design to explore photography, typography and graphic design, printmaking, and drawing. I’ve earned a BA in Political Science and Spanish Language/Literature from the George Washington University and an MA in Communications from Georgetown University. HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN PRINTMAKING? Almost completely by chance, actually. I’ve worked in advertising for a long time and have been fortunate to work with extremely talented copywriters, designers, producers, and programmers. The bulk of my experience is in creating interactive and print campaigns and products for hospitality, travel, automotive, and consumer products companies in the US and Europe. And while I’ve always been co mfortable collaborating with brand managers and market researchers and account executives, I ’ve often felt that working with my design teams was harder than it needed to be . I’m not sure if this was due to my lack of hands-on design experience, not sharing the same vocabulary, some fundamental gap between left-brain and right-brain personalities. But as the guy ultimately responsible for the quality of our work , I was determined to find a way to improve my interaction with my designers. My approach was to take classes at the Corcoran College of Art + Design, everything from Photoshop and InDesign to drawing, photography, lighting design for interiors, and graphic design. A few years back I replaced a can celed class with screenprinting and was absolutely amazed by the powerful emotional and physical connection I felt in the studio . The physicality of the process, infinite opportunities to follow traditional techniques or to experiment with new approaches, the joy of creating multiples, it all had me hooked right from the start. DESCRIBE WHERE YOU WORK The bulk of my printing happens in the print studio at the Corcoran, which is in the basement of a really old, former public school building in DC. It’s a great space to learn the basics. It’s on the smaller side, so you learn quickly how to work in close quarters with other printers, how to move carefully between printers as you carry your prints to the rack, how to be aware of those moving around you with prints or pots of ink or the random sharp, pointy object. Our equipment is anything but fancy – wood and aluminum screens clamped to work tables – no cool vacuum tables or anything like that. And it certainly isn’t new – our racks and floors and tables and washout room are layered with spots and smears of ink, scratches, rust, dents – a subtle reminder that there’s history all around us, the collective creativity and sweat and effort of all the students and masters who’ve printed before us. T hat makes the space inspiring , and as cramped and frustrating as it can be , it feel s like home. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PRINTMAKING PROCESS? Screenprinting, definitely. I studied intaglio many years ago with master printer Scip Barnhart, which was really a great experience. But as much as I enjoyed the process, it's so much slower than screenprinting. And much more dependent on my ability to draw, which is probably one of my least-developed skills . So while I enjoy it, most of my intaglio work would probably be stick figures interacting with other stick figures. Screenprinting, on the other hand, well, that’s a whole different ballgame. My creative process for screenprinting is fueled in so many ways by my photography , through abstract designs or compositions in Photoshop or Illustrator, or more traditionally through non-digital processes. I’m able to envision an d create much more effectively – and I think at a higher level – through screenprinting than I would with any other process. WHAT'S YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS FOR ANY GIVEN PRINT? (EG. SKETCH FIRST? PRE-PLANNED OR FREE-FORM?) My best prints - or at least the ones I feel are the most successful - start out from my photographs. I try to travel to interesting places, though recently (thanks, economy!) those places have been much closer to home. P laces like Philadelphia , shooting well-known but very interesting places l ike Eastern State Penitentiary or Smith Island, Maryland, which is home of the many-layered Smith Island Cake . I’ll even drive for hours and hours to places like Centralia, PA, which is what’s left of an entire town destroyed by a coal mine fire. Places with history, with a unique story, with some kind of beauty and meaning. I then pul l everything into Photoshop or Illustrator to experiment with texture, tone, balance, all the little t weaks needed to pull together an exciting composition. Sometimes there’s a lot of manipulation involved, as with my print “El Gran Gallo,” where the original photograph is substantially transformed into a graphic print. Other times the digital work is very minimal, as with “ Gull , ” where Photoshop was used merely to create CMYK separations, the print clearly reflecting its photographic origins. Finally, it's into the studio, where I try to challenge mysel f with each new project, working with new color palettes, techniques that are new and unusual, or sizes or aspect ratios that I haven't worked with before. WHAT DO YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT PRINTMAKING? The night before I go into the studio I'll spend some time doing a mental walk-through of my battle plan, about everything that needs to be done, about the best timing, order, where things can go wrong. I try to anticipate problems and how to keep them from happening. So by the time I get into the studio, I have a fairly good idea of what needs to happen, when, and how I can act and react if anything funky happens. What I love about printmaking, then, is when I get into the studio and the day unfolds much like I've visualized it. I'm in the zone, everything is breaking my way. My film looks just like I want it, the emulsion isn't too old and is holding the detail of my images nicely. There's plenty of room to work, I'm getting my inks together without much hassle. And when the printing begins, it's almost on automatic, pour, flood, drop, pull, lift, flood, repeat. I spin gingerly on one foot and carry my prints to the rack, the other printers in the studio moving deftly aside as I scoot by. There's a harmony, a synchronicity between us. My head's down, I'm doing good work, the rhythm and pacing are spot on. Can’t get enough of that feeling. WHAT'S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THE PROCESS? I hate picking colors for my prints. I am woefully unschooled in color theory, though I do generally know a good color combination when I see one. But my knowledge and skill in this area are very rough, unrefined. I’m certainly not delicate when it comes to color, and often default to bold colors because I just don’t trust myself outside of this comfort zone . I've been aching to take a color theory class for years, but haven’t had any luck so far . Fortunately my instructors Manuel Navarette and Carolyn Hartmann have been extremely gracious in sharing little color theory insights with me , suggesting better combinations or directions for particular projects. But I'd very much l ike to take color theory so I can embrace this part of the process more fully, make it more my own. WHAT ARE YOUR INSPIRATIONS (OTHER ARTISTS, PEOPLE, PLACES, EVENTS, ETC.)? In the last 15 years or so, there are three artists who have really inspired me to embrace artistic pursuits. First is Scip Barnhart , my intaglio instructor , who gave me my first taste of the technical skill and creative processes required to create something meaningful, beautiful, fulfilling. More recently are two New Orleans artists, Matt Rinard and Robert Guthrie . I've been collecting their work for years and have been surrounded at home by their prints and originals and bits of sculpture. Each time I catch a glimpse of their work , some little emotional part of me think s fondly of New Orleans and an overwhelming sense of happiness wash es over me. L et me make it clear that I'm absolutely in no way comparing my work to the awesomeness these guys create, but knowing how happy their art makes me, I thought it would be really, amazingly cool to see if I could find something within m e , some creativity, some passion, that could give a bit of that happiness to others. And it goes without saying that I’d be absolutely nowhere in any of this without the attention, support, and dedication of my instructors Carolyn and Manuel. HOW HAS YOUR WORK CHANGED AND EVOLVED SINCE YOU STARTED? It’s important to understand that when I walked into the studio that very first day, I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. None. Yeah, I’d had that intaglio experience with Scip years earlier, but wow, such a different process, diff erent tools, different mindset. So I was really starting from scratch. My first year or so was spent focused on the basics, developing the muscle memory of the right way to pull the squeegee across my screen, developing a fluidity of movement in my personal printing process, becoming familiar with the temperament of the inks and acrylic base, how they change based on environmental circumstances, how to coax them into doing what I want them to do with a little bit of airbrush cleaner. My prints in this time were very traditional, straightforward examples, pretty much just ink on paper. But throughout that first year, I did two important things. First, I asked questions, a lot of questions. I’m sure I drove my instructors a little nuts. Second, I searched bookstores and galleries and the internet for more information on screenprinting , but also generally about all types of printmaking. So over the course of that year, I learned, for example, about metallic powders and glass beads and me coflock and the use of adhesives. I learned about very interesting techniques using wax and oil paint to a d d depth and dimension to my prints. I discovered how important it can be to pick the right paper for an edition, because some papers simply won’t accommodate an artist’s vision for a particular project. I also developed a sense of the projects I should (and shouldn’t) be tackling. My dad was an artist, and I thought it would be a neat homage to his work to create a print of one of his paintings. It was hard as hell, to be honest. Not only technically, because perhaps my skills with Photoshop and as a printmaker weren’t quite yet up to that level of reproduction, but also emotionally because I was putting lots of pressure on myself to do justice to the original piece. Add to that some difficulties with new inks that I was using, and a few other hiccups, and we had the recipe for one spectacular, colossal failure. I still think it’s a good idea to challenge yourself, obviously, but perhaps I’d piled on too many expectations, too much pressure. I’ve found that I work better and am much more satisfied when I’m focused on my personal vision for my pieces, with their genesis in my photography or drawing or whatnot, because I only need to be true to myself, my vision, my creativity. In the past few years, all of this learning, experimentation, successes and failures have definitely influenced my work , changed it – I think – for the better . As much as I still love the straightforward ink-on-paper approach, I’ve also embraced some less traditional processes. Images that are c on c ealed by 15 or more layers of multi-colored inks, then sanded to carefully reveal parts of the obscured subject. Images printed in clear acrylic base, with acrylic glazes or wax and oil paints used to provide color, depth, dimension. All this experimentation comes at a price, though. If I’d been sticking to simpler projects using more basic skills, I’d have a much broader, deeper portfolio by now. Instead, I have a handful of finished editions that I love, combined with drawers and portfolios full of pieces in various stages of completion: waiting to be sanded, waiting for an epiphany to recover from an experimental misstep, pieces that I’m just not sure how to finish. I’m okay with that trade-off, because it’s my belief that I need to spend a whole bunch of years up front working on technique so that later on I can print larger editions, more complicated editions flawlessly and with (relative) ease. HOW DO YOU GET PAST CREATIVE SLUMPS? Check back with me in a few years, I’m still trying to figure that out! I've definitely hit a few walls so far. One way I’ve attacked t he problem of becoming frustrated with my skills development is by changing instructors. Which is absolutely not a knock on one instructor or another, but I think it's important to learn from different people, to be pushed and encouraged and challenged by people with unique perspectives, paths, approaches. When I get stuck creatively, in terms of what I am going to do next, it’s sometimes good to just be in the studio printing, even if I’m not working on my next masterpiece. Because I have a day job, my studio time is very limited. And I often find myself trying to maximize my productivity by printing complicated pieces, sometimes with funky techniques or levels of detail that maybe , maybe I shouldn’t be embracing quite yet. And when things don't work out exactly as I'd planned, I'm especially hard on myself. So lots of practice, especially with less meaningful subject matter, is key. Get in the studio and just print some squares or squiggles, but aim to make all the right choices: paper, composition, colors, technique, bringing everything together so you print the best darn squiggles you can. HOW DO YOU PROMOTE YOUR WORK? I'm just st arting to figure that out . Like I said, most of my best prints start out as my photographs. "El Gran Gallo" is an interpretation of a picture I made of a rooster at the Great Frederick Fair in Frederick, MD, which lent itself to a particularly cool transformation into a graphic print . But sometimes my photos just need to live as photos. So if you visit my E tsy shop or flickr photostream, you'll see I have photos as well as prints available. My approach so far has been very basic: have a bit of a presence on my personal site , post photos and prints to flickr and to lots of flickr groups , and try selling some pieces on E tsy. It's frustrating, I don't yet have a good sense of where best to promote my work, or how to best price my photos and prints. I don't want to overcharge, but I also don't want to low-ball. After all, camera lenses and studio time don't come cheap. Other printmakers at my studio say they've had good success on eBay, but honestly, a 12% cut of a sale seems a little excessive to me. Maybe that’s penny-wise and pound-foolish , I don’t know . I'm also starting to explore print exchanges and submitting my work to shows, but I don't yet have a sense of the return that will have for me. Right now I’m just throw ing everything against the wall to see what sticks. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR ADVICE FOR OTHERS WHO WANT TO TRY MAKING HAND-PULLED PRINTS? Trust your gut. Whether it’s screenprinting or intaglio or litho, you’re going to know when you’ve found a process that’s a good fit for you. Struggling is part of the technical and creative learning process, so you shouldn’t use a little difficulty up front as an excuse to give up. But there’s certainly a difference between becoming proficient with a particular process and discovering you have a passion for it.

Chef Matt Amsden, author of RAWvolution: Gourmet Living Cuisine , owns RAWvolution, a gourmet raw living cuisine delivery service in Santa Monica and New York City. Man on the Raw and I first went raw on February 16, 2004, it was a Valentine Day’s gift to ourselves. We went to Barnes and Noble in Aurora, Colorado and were determined to find an eating program we could do together. The first two raw books we bought were David Wolfe’s “Nature’s First Law: The Raw Food Diet” and “The Complete Book of Raw Food.” I have been blessed to begin my raw food adventure with my husband. No matter how far one or both of us may stray off the raw path, we both know the importance of getting back on track and finding some sort of balance in our lives. I realize that we may be the exception and not the rule. Many people who embrace raw foods do so&nbsp;alone, and in the beginning, it can be a very isolating experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends and family don’t understand the weird new “diet” you are on and can’t seem to understand why a slab of cow is bad for your health. It can be hard going it alone. Thank heavens for Raw Food online communities. I have been exploring raw foods for six years and even now I embrace community. I am a member at Give it to Me Raw, Global Juice Feast, Juicefeasting.com, Daily Raw Inspiration and most recently Raw Food Rehab. I observe for the most part, reading the forums, sharing my photos and commenting whenever a topic moves me and I can add something constructive to the conversation. Raw communities are a wonderful place to share your raw triumphs, tribulations and everything in between. I encourage you, if you haven’t already, join community. I am a huge fan of author and owner of RAWvolution and Euphoria Loves Rawvolution , Matt Amsden. On Tuesday he will share his “10 Thoughts” and Wednesday his recipes, from the Complete Book of Raw Food Endeavor , make an appearance. On Friday, I review the ebook “ Me Raw: You Cooked ,” the story of Emma MacDougall’s raw journey and how it affected her relationship with her (then) fiancée, Rod. The first of its kind, the book focuses raw foodies and their non-raw partners, providing insightful guidance, tips and recipes along the way. Also, one lucky reader will have a chance to win the book. To get the week started here is a brief list of online communities where you can communicate with others interested in the raw food lifestyle. Raw Food Rehab Global Juice Feast Juicefeasting.com Living and Raw Foods Daily Raw Inspiration Give It To Me Raw Gone Raw Raw Food Talk Raw Food Lifestyle VegSource.com Can you think of&nbsp;more opportunities (support groups, rawlucks, etc.) or online sites where raw foodies can converse? Sunchokes, also called Jerusalem artichokes ((They’re not from Jerusalem, and they’re not artichokes.), are the roots of a plant in the sunflower family. Sunchokes look like bulging ginger roots with many stubby outcroppings. The ivory flesh has the consistency of water chestnuts and taste slightly sweet and nutty. Select - Look for firm sun chokes that are evenly beige. They are available all year-round. Store - Refrigerate in a plastic bag for up to 1 week. Once exposed to the air, sunchokes oxidize quickly and discolor.&nbsp; You can soak them in lemon&nbsp;water&nbsp;to avoid discoloration. Preparation - Scrub sunchokes and don't peel them, all the are just below the surface of the skin. These are the sunchokes we pulled out of our garden a week ago. They were planted about 3 years ago, each year we remember we have a crop and we start digging. No need to re-plant every year because there is always a few surviving in the ground and they do a good job at taking root. They are a bit like weeds in that sense. Use Sunchokes as you would jicama, in salads, soups, mashed, dehydrated, the list goes on and one.

Jonathan Weber’s Spicy seed mix (p. 117) transformed from thick, soggy glob to a very crunchy, seasoned snack, in a relatively short amount of time. The spices&nbsp;were on point, Man on the Raw thought the nibbles was just spicy enough without overpowering the taste buds. Beware of&nbsp;John Larsen's&nbsp;Tasty Sea snacks (p. 117). I found a half of cup of Nama Shoyu&nbsp;a bit too generous, causing it to be to salty. Although, Man on the Raw enjoyed the flavor, he suggested I tone&nbsp; down the Nama Shoyu, if I were going to take a batch to an Oscar party I was attending.&nbsp; On a second batch, I decreased&nbsp;the amount of Nama Shoyu to one-fourth of a cup, made them bite-size&nbsp;and was off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ha, ha happy ending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the point where happy endings&nbsp;turn sour and my mild obsessive tendencies came to surface. The story actually begins on February 19th, when I came across some incredible Raw Zucchini Chips featured on the blog Green and Crunchy . They were beautiful, crispy, crunchy little discs. By far a perfect substitution for Lays or Pringles any day. Life moved forward, as it does so often, and I quickly forgot about the little bits of heaven, at least until I saw Bitt of Raw’s posting of Zucchini Chips and her cute dog eating raw zucchini. Adorable. Zucchini chips were not going away any time soon, thus the seeds of my obsession was firmly planted in my brain. I went to The Complete Book of Raw Food, you know my endeavor and all, searching for a recipe comparable to what I had read on the blogs. I found what I was seeking on page 178, Shazzie ’s recipe for Curly Crisps. On the surface, everything seemed to be moving in the right direction. I had a cool hand-held mandoline, a few small zucchini, a beet and a couple of plump, light green, stubby things called Mexican Squash. Using my cool, hand-held mandoline, I sliced the vegetables into thin rounds, a shy away from being paper thin, but not quite. I choose a variety of basic seasonings, including garlic, onion, wasabi and barbecue powders, nothing too spectacular or out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Well maybe the wasabi, but&nbsp;I digress. My first batch, I placed in the dehydrator for 115 degrees for about 12 hours. The edges of my produce curled, taking on a slight crispiness, but nothing compared to potato chips. The middle of the vegetable discs were something less to be desired. They were soft and pliable, resembling nothing like a chip. I popped them back in the dehydrator for another few hours. Nothing changed, except the size of my zucchini chips, they shrank. This whole process continued over the course of a week. Attempting varying sizes and thinness of different root vegetables, with Teflex sheet, without Teflex sheet, with salt, without salt, with oil, without oil. Good, eatable food was thrown in the compost bucket because they weren't crisp enough. I was relentless, Man on the Raw was impatient with my compulsive, slightly psychotic behavior. But I couldn’t help it. I wanted a crispy, crunchy chip and I was bound and determined to create one. Finally, I received a reprieve. I had a promising batch of zucchini and beet chips on Sunday. They came from the dehydrator after 30 hours at 115 degrees and they were actually a good, crunchy consistency.&nbsp; Success, the girls enjoyed them and I finally had something the Man on the Raw could give his seal of approval on and he wouldn’t have to send me away to a psych ward. That was the case, until the girls ate most of them and the ones that remained were left uncovered and I suppose the moisture from the Colorado air (yeah, right), turned them back to a soft, pliable chip taking on the texture of a mildly waterlogged potato chip. Of course, when Man on the Raw came home after an exhausting evening of work, he wasn’t in the correct frame of mind to believe me when I told him my chips were&nbsp;crispy at one point in their life. He just kind of heaved a sigh and his chin sank to the ground. I bite down on the side of my lip and&nbsp;quickly promised I wouldn’t attempt another batch of vegetable chips until I ended my juice feast and I was able to taste test&nbsp;them myself.

While I'm not where I want to be ultimately (I'm nursing so I'm low raw right now), it's become something I actually ENJOY. I love how I feel and love all the creativity that goes into each dish ."
I could not let the day pass without letting all the Blogland residents know that we lost one of our citizens today. The beautiful and wonderful Renee, lost her battle with cancer last night. I know we are all happy that she is no longer in pain. She is dancing with the angels right now, she is free. Renee, was a special woman and she taught us so much. Many in the blogging community are grieving right now. I know she is watching and wanting us to be happy. Sending hugs and love to all who miss her. xoxo My life would not be the same without dogs. At the moment we have two female schnauzers. Our miniature schnauzer Yazou is getting old, but with daily medication for her heart and a bit of our patience during the walks... we can manage alright together. Our standard schnauzer Bella is four years younger and likes to play and run like a puppy. They both are really sweet dogs. But I think every dogowner says so :-)   Anyway, someone sent me an advertisement of Pedigree dogfood. They have filmed dogs in slow motion while catching a small piece of food and that is really beautiful to see, I think. But you better look for yourself! (Sorry that I don't know how to incorporate a link here). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUCRZzhbHH0
A few weeks ago Bonnie, the more exciteable of the two puppies, charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose. It bloody hurt. Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose. However, me being me, I thought, "it can't possibly be Bonnie's fault" and so I decided I had sinusitis! Stop laughing at the back .&nbsp; Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had. Except today I couldn't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor. So off I trudged, to his little TARDIS in the next village, and let him have a right good look up my hooter. Prodding and pressing, feeling and caressing, asking me about snot and things on my hankie, he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine. "Have you knocked it recently?" he asked. "Oh, well one of my puppies did a bit since," I answered.&nbsp; Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis. "You've broken your nose," he said. He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense. It's slightly swollen but is now on the mend and apparently re-setting itself. And it still bloody hurts! And moving swiftly on, Amy drew out five names from her "see you, Jimmy" hat.&nbsp; I will contact each one of you and ask for your address so that I can send a copy of my childrens book to you.&nbsp; Here is the Vlog we did which shows Amy drawing the names from the hat.&nbsp; If you didn't win a copy but would like to receive one, you can always buy one here .&nbsp; Thank you for all your comments and for taking part in my little competition. What do you say to them when you realise that whatever you do say might not be understood.&nbsp; Or will be, more times than not, a waste of time, and will make you feel worse than you probably do already.&nbsp; Those beautiful malteser eyes stare up at me with huge great tears just bursting with volcanic resemblence, and I am supposed to decide in a split second whether this is an age issue, or one of autistic trait. Last week I lost the plot.&nbsp; I guess sometimes even mums are allowed to have a tantrum, and that was what I did.&nbsp; The door took most of it, but I must have looked like a mad woman; completely crazed by a child's rudeness.&nbsp; I couldn't cry.&nbsp; Tears wouldn't come to the surface even though I was sobbing inside.&nbsp; I knew having a tantrum in front of my autistic daughter was the worst thing I could have done, and I'm still reliving it seven days later, when she tells me how crazy I was.&nbsp; But then the inevitable happened; word from elsewhere that Amy had been telling her friends about our little tete-a-tete.&nbsp; I was wrong to do what I did, I'm usually calm and walk away from a situation where I know I cannot win, but just occasionally, that little wire snaps, and bingo.&nbsp; I'm a gonna. Of course things calmed down within the hour but I spent a few days beating myself up, thinking of new ways to tackle the issues which no doubt surround adolescence.&nbsp; But what's not easy to get a handle on is adolescence vs autism.&nbsp; As yet I do not know exactly what the next twelve months will bring, let alone the next five years of which I am sure will be just as hard for Amy as it will for me.&nbsp; The school are helping, as is the school nurse, but right now, support is very thin on the ground.&nbsp; And that, I am sorry to say, is nothing new. p.s. Book giveaway draw will take place either tomorrow or Wednesday; am trying to persuade reluctant child to help with filming it! Something amazing happened yesterday.&nbsp; I knew at the beginning of the week that I was nearing the end of my novel, the one I have been writing on and off for the past two years.&nbsp; The one in which I have fictionalised my own paranormal experiences, seeing them through Camilla's eyes.&nbsp; I have lived her life, thought her thoughts, created her from my own imagination.&nbsp; I have felt as if I owned her, as if she answered only to me.&nbsp; I have visualised actors playing the parts of characters, Martin Shaw as the Reverand Oakley, Robson Green as Michael all verging on a complete fantasy of which I have seen played out before my eyes. But yesterday I realised that I had reached the light which marked the end of my work in progress.&nbsp; I had said everything that needed to be said, got to the point where stretching out the novel for the sake of length would have been wrong and most likely spoilt the whole effect.&nbsp; And so I closed the file and finished it.&nbsp; I haven't typed the words, "The End" because I am sure there will be much to add, and too much to subtract.&nbsp; I have put my little memory sticks on which the book is saved, into a drawer and locked it.&nbsp; After the lambing I will open that drawer and begin the editing process which I know will be hard, but will mean another step nearer to presenting it for potential publication.&nbsp; I suspect finding a publisher will be the most difficult part, but for now I shall enjoy achieving my goal of writing my paranormal novel. And so, in order to celebrate this achievement, I am giving away three copies of a children's book which I wrote myself and self-published.&nbsp; The book, Adventures at Aaron Loch Farm, is a compilation of children's stories which I wrote a few years ago.&nbsp; It's nothing fancy, but all my own work, including the book cover picture.&nbsp; But I'm proud of it, because it was the first book I had published, albeit by myself.&nbsp; I shall write all commenters names on a separate piece of paper then ask Amy to draw out three at random.&nbsp; I'm more than happy to post anywhere in the world.&nbsp; And if I get lots of comments I shall increase this giveaway to five copies, but if you would rather not receive a copy and you still want to leave a comment, just say, I won't in the least bit be offended.&nbsp; You know me, I love my comments.&nbsp; CJ xx We had one of those unforgettable family afternoons on Sunday.&nbsp; The sky was blue, few clouds scattered in recognisable shapes, a distant micro-glider buzzing above the barley fields.&nbsp; The Farmer was sawing down hedges, keeping himself busy in the Spring sun whilst Amy and I played hide and seek, her idea; mine was to sit down and play a board game.&nbsp; One of Amy's hiding places was behind the greenhouse, made of glass. I had no problem finding her on that occasion. We decided to join the Farmer in the end, walking down the field to be greeted by 4 excited collies, bounding towards us.&nbsp; I couldn't miss the opportunity of taking the camera and the camcorder, so here's a little vlog snippet for you, it's only a minute in length, without my ugly mug, so quite safe to watch. A long time ago, when I lived in the South East, I did some contract work for the Crown Prosecution Service; a very interesting job but one I couldn't have undertaken as a permanent post.&nbsp; I saw many harrowing files, witnessed cases being brought to court, and even sat in on a murder trial to assist one of the law clerks.&nbsp; It was pressure all the way, and even though I was young, married to my first husband with no children, I just wasn't cut out for the responsibility in which the job demanded.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I made few friends and was quite relieved once my contract came to an end, lucky enough to find a permanent job not long after at Rothmans where I did make friends and felt much more at ease.&nbsp; But even though my temporary post at the CPS didn't work out, I have always been interested in law; attending college to get the Institute of Export qualification thus making my job at Rothmans more successful. Now I find myself asking a question; as a defence lawyer, knowing your client is guilty, with strong evidence to prove it, how would you defend them?&nbsp; You have a murderer or the like standing in the witness box, having just sworn on the bible, and refusing to accept responsibility for their actions, yet the lawyer knows otherwise.&nbsp; Does the lawyer get his client off and risk that person being back on the streets to murder again?&nbsp; What is classed as winning a case so far as the defence team are concerned?&nbsp; When I was a little girl I used to love visiting my grandma.&nbsp; She lived in a 3 bedroom 1930's semi on the outskirts of a small town.&nbsp; The house also had a large back garden, seeming much bigger when I was a child.&nbsp; We always used the back door which opened into a little porch, or lean-to as is sometimes known, which went straight into a small kitchen.&nbsp; I remember the units being similar to the ones we used to have in the farm house kitchen before it was renovated.&nbsp; Two doors in the kitchen, one leading into the back room which was used most of the time and the other going into the front room, a large sitting room with a sideboard, gramophone and a few other pieces of furniture of which I can't quite recall.&nbsp; I do remember however, the photographs of which grandma had on display, sitting proudly in their frames on the sideboard. I used to love this room; I would spend most of our visits playing on my own with the brass ornaments grandma had on the fireplace.&nbsp; I often got told not to touch but you know what kids are like.&nbsp; But I was always so proud of the baby photo; I used to stare at it and ask my mum to tell me what I was like as a baby. The reason why I look so chubby was because my parents left me with my auntie for two weeks not long before it was taken.&nbsp; My dad had to go to Germany on business and mum decided to go with him, taking my almost 4 year old brother with them.&nbsp; When they returned they were shocked to see me as I lay in my pram, the only explanation being my auntie had fed me on bananas for the whole duration. Having been passsed the baton by Trish of Mum's Gone To , I now proudly present it to my taggee who can be found here .&nbsp; This is a picture of the person in question, a little clue for you on the photograph. No matter how many times we wish we had the better option, we are always able to make do with what we have.&nbsp; I have learnt over the years that the challenges and obstacles of which I have been faced with have not been bestowed on me because I couldn't cope.&nbsp; We go through many testing times throughout our existence, some of us are faced with more than others, but these are only times which we can deal with, only tests in which we will, eventually, pass. We need people in our lives to help us cope with the days that we wish our parallel universe was a little nearer to reality.&nbsp; It isn't easy sailing through life having nothing to worry about, and that is something most of us will never experience.&nbsp; I worry if I haven't got something to worry about.&nbsp; The responsibilities we take on during the course of our lives are often so great that it isn't uncommon for one to feel we are in it way over our heads, incapable of getting through a day. Life is a precious gift; imagine how incredible it would be if there were two of us.&nbsp; A parallel existence in another universe could be all the things we always wanted to be, it could do everything we planned to do, visit all the places we want to see, have the perfect job, live in a perfect house.&nbsp; Even though this wouldn't be reality, what would you want for your life in a parallel world?&nbsp; Putting aside your contentment in this life, imagining you could choose another You. I had Amy's statement( of special education needs ) review recently. The first one at her new school. I came away with a spring in my step, totally in awe at the incredibly keen interest of which the school have taken towards her welfare. They can't do enough for her, ensuring she gets the maximum enjoyment and educational support she possibly can. I had my report to submit, along with reports from the school and her communications officer. And what I found comforting was the fact that we are all on the same wavelength. Nodding heads and lots of "yes, absolutely"'s and I felt good inside. Amy's growing up, and the school are acknowledging that head on. As you know, she has started doing life skills which comprise of swimming, helping at another school, cookery and soon to be helping at a library and possibly a nursery. The nursery arrangement concerned me a little due to Amy's difficulties in dealing with younger children ( she gets very aggressive towards them ) but the school once more came up trumps and ensured me she would be observed and supervised at all times. The current statement stipulates 26 hours support per week, but the authorities were suggesting that this be reduced to 20 hours as from 1st April. The school are in total disagreement with this plan and are insisting that 26 hours remains, if not to be increased. I was almost jumping up and down with thanks. It's so important that Amy doesn't lose any hours because, as the school agreed, the reason why she has been doing so well at middle school is because she has a good level of support. But it's all about funding. People don't matter anymore; and that's what we need to change.
this is the house of my great-grandparents and the place where my grandmother was born. My family moved already before I was born and for a while nobody lived there. Later my parents spent some weekends with friends over there. my parents in 1967 Then the house was sold, but from time to time we came back together with my grandparents. I remember my grandmother standing in front of the house and telling stories from the past. Although the place changed over the years, she still felt a deep connection, not only to the house and ground, but I think to her family´s past - that´s what she called HOME. Feeling some kind of "unsettledness" inside myself, I lately think a lot about what HOME is. I´d like to know where or what do you call HOME? found these funny vintage hotel bathroom papers from the sixties still rests of snow on the rooftops... and I feel soooo tired these days and so do my 2 cats.

A man stumbles up to the only other patron in a bar and asks if he could buy him a drink. "Why of course," comes the reply. The first man then asks: "Where are you from?" "I'm from Ireland," replies the second man. The first man responds: "You don't say. &nbsp;I'm from Ireland too! Let's have another round to Ireland." "Of course," replies the second man. Curious, the first man then asks: "Where in Ireland are you from?" "Dublin," comes the reply. "I can't believe it," says the first man.&nbsp; "I'm from Dublin too! Let's have another drink to Dublin." "Of course," replies the second man. Curiosity again strikes and the first man asks: "What school did you go to?" "Saint Mary's," replies the second man.&nbsp; "I graduated in '62." "This is unbelievable!" the first man says.&nbsp; " I went to Saint Mary's and I graduated in '62, too!" About that time in comes one of the regulars and sits down at the bar.&nbsp; "What's been going on?" he asks the bartender. "Nothing much," replies the bartender. "The O'Malley twins are drunk again." Happy St. Patrick's Day...! And remember, on St. Patrick's Day, everybody's Irish. The human mind is a very strange place, and I can't begin to understand some of the strange things that have happened to me. I am a pragmatic sort of person, and I don't believe in the supernatural, or psychic occurrences, and yet these things keep happening. One day a few years ago I was on an inter-city bus, going to visit my brother who at that time lived in a suburb of Vancouver. As the bus turned a corner a few blocks from his house, I began to feel strange. I had the feeling I was in a speeding car, and I had no control. I began to have a feeling of panic as the car entered a tunnel. My breathing began to quicken and the feeling of panic overwhelmed me. At the next stop, I got off the bus and composed myself, walking for a few minutes and breathing the fresh air. When I got to my brother's place, the feeling had passed and I was completely myself again. My brother offered me a cup of coffee and a snack, and we chatted, and I felt as if nothing had happened. But the strange event stayed with me, and I could not forget it. When I got home a few hours later, I switched on the television to see the news report of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a tunnel in Paris. With the time difference between Vancouver and Paris, I determined that the accident had happened at precisely the same moment I had had my strange incident on the bus. I had never felt a connection with Diana, and I wondered why our minds had chosen to connect across the universe at just that moment in time. And then I thought perhaps we are all connected on some level -- with one consciousness. Some of the strange thoughts that pop in and out of our heads may actually be the echoes of other people's thoughts -- a sudden craving for a Crispy Crunch chocolate bar, a piece of music, thoughts of a friend who is just about to phone us, and we pick up the phone knowing who it is. These things happen to us every day, and they remain a mystery to all of us. There's a new series on NBC called "Who Do You Think You Are?" based on the popular BBC series that has been running since 2004. The premise of the show is to trace the family trees of celebrities. I have always been interested in genealogy, and I would love to trace my family tree. My mother always claimed her family was descended from French barons and baronesses, and my father always used to counter with, "Well, that makes up for the fact that my family is descended from Irish horse thieves." I think for both of them, the truth lies somewhere in between. As with all families, if we shake our family trees, we will shake out a few famous people, and a few infamous. Last week's episode featured Sarah Jessica Parker. She was amazed to discover that one of her ancestors was Esther Elwell, her tenth great grandmother, who had been arrested for practicing witchcraft during the Salem Witch trials. Esther, along with two other women, had been accused of performing witchcraft on their neighbor, Mary Fitch, causing her death. However, the date of the deposition, November 8th, 1692, happened after the dissolution of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and her case never went to trial. Esther lived to be 82 years old, and she was the last woman to be accused of witchraft in Salem. How much of our ancestors' DNA do we inherit? I have always felt a very close affinity with Queen Elizabeth the First. When I read about her, and the time in which she lived, I have a very strong feeling of déjà vu. It's almost as if I can remember things from that period of history. And she was a redhead, and there are a large number of redheads in our family. As well as our physical attributes, are our ancestors' memories encoded in their DNA and passed on to us? If so, what memories are we passing on to our descendants? When Sarah Jessica Parker was learning about her ancestors lives, she felt an emotional connection with them. Does the silver thread that connects us remain unbroken throughout the generations? Are we the sum of our ancestors' lives and experiences? Perhaps we are more closely connected to these strangers than we realize. Who do you think you are? Don't forget to move your clocks forward tonight. I have been uncharacteristically busy the past couple of days, and I do apologize for not having time to respond, or to visit you. I'll be back soon. Cheers, During the recent health care debates in a certain country just south of us -- which country shall remain nameless -- Canada was used as an example of a country with bad health care. The insurance companies in that country south of us don't want folks to know that not only is health care in Canada some of the best in the world, Canadian residents don't have to mortgage their homes or go bankrupt in order to pay for medical procedures, medications or treatment. I work in the health care system, and I see first-hand how caring the doctors and health care professionals are, and how they will move mountains if necessary to help anyone who needs help. If you think that sounds a bit melodramatic, it's not. I have seen doctors spend hours with patients who have been diagnosed with serious or life-threatening illnesses, making sure the patients get the help they need with medical attention, diagnostic examinations, treatment and even providing outreach workers to help the patients psychologically in addition to their medical help. In British Columbia, a patient can have an x-ray done at a northern outpost, the x-ray can be posted to a grid and read instantly by a radiologist in Vancouver. The same applies to other laboratory and diagnostic tests. And if treatment is required, the patient receives it immediately. There is a province-wide computer network of all patients' medications, so no patient can "doctor shop" for duplications of medications, or inadvertently take medications that have adverse effects on each other. In other words, we have actually progressed from leeches and blood-letting. So, I was quite pleased to read the following article in today's Vancouver Sun newspaper: (Vancouver – March 10) Research published today in the New England Journal of Medicine sheds new light on which Hodgkin lymphoma patients are likely to relapse after receiving treatment. BC Cancer Agency researchers have discovered that the number of macrophages – a type of white blood cell that normally scavenges foreign material – found in a patient’s tumour had a strong correlation to treatment outcome. The greater the number of macrophages; the greater the likelihood of a relapse. Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of lymphocytes which typically affects young adults, but can occur at any age. It is a highly treatable form of cancer, with about 75 to 85 percent of patients cured with initial treatment. However, if the first therapy fails, secondary treatment usually includes a bone marrow transplant, which is only successful for about one-half of these cases. “The study demonstrates that high numbers of macrophages are associated with treatment resistance in Hodgkin lymphoma suggesting a way to identify the 25 percent of patients who currently don’t respond well,” says Dr. Joseph Connors, one of the study researchers and clinical director of the BC Cancer Agency’s Centre for Lymphoid Cancer. The research was conducted with funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research with additional funding from BC Cancer Agency Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, the Lymphoma Research Foundation, and the Cancer Research Society of Canada. In a perfect world, no one would ever get sick, but unfortunately that's not the case. As I have said many times before, I am puzzled as to why a wealthy country like that big country to the south of us has such spotty health care -- two different systems for the haves and the have-nots. We love our cousins to the south; they're Canada's best friends, and we hope they get their health care problem fixed, and we hope they get it right. Whatever works for them is definitely the best solution. And what works in Canada may not work for them, but perhaps we here in the backwoods Canada may have something to show them, if they'll let us. Cheers, Do you ever have completely insane dreams, and you wake up the next morning and think ... "What the h-ll...?" I have been doing that a lot lately. The other night I dreamt I was in a tsunami. It's sort of a recurring dream, because I was once actually in a tsunami and it was very frightening. Last night I dreamt I was walking along the banks of the Somass River in Port Alberni, and I was with David Duchovny. We were on a high cliff, and I was showing him how crystal clear the water was. He leaned over a little too far, and I said "Careful, don't fall in..." and just at that moment he fell head first over the cliff and into the water. There was a group of people picnicking on the shore, and I hollered at them "Call 911! Call 911!" And then I woke up. David Duchovny...!? David Duchovny doesn't cross my mind from one year to the next -- I have never even watched "The X Files" and it was filmed here in Vancouver -- how did he get into my dream? And why were we walking along the banks of the Somass River? I also dreamt last night that I was caught in a huge blizzard. I had gone shopping for groceries, and while I was in the store, snow had started falling. As I went outside, the wind was howling and the snow was knee deep. I remember trudging across the road thinking, "Why didn't I wear my boots?" Where do we go when we dream? The scientific explanation for dreams is that the synapses in our brains are processing things that have occurred during the day. In his book "The Interpretation of Dreams" , Sigmund Freud once called our dreams, "The royal road to the unconscious." He also said, "... every dream will reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of significance, and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state." I do believe there is a scientific reason for our dreams. But why for goodness sake was I dreaming about David Duchovny? The truth is out there... Yesterday I had the opportunity to see the movie "Precious", and apart from being the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, it also opened a window to a world I did not know even existed. In fact, the movie was so disturbing, I had to turn it off a few times before I could continue watching it. And please note, if you decide to watch it, make sure any family members under the age of 18 are out of the house. I don't think anyone should be subject to that sort of language or visual content until they are mature enough not be traumatized. I'm only slightly younger than Methuselah, and it traumatized me. I had definite mixed feelings about the film, and about Gabourey Sidibe's performance. She was perfectly cast in the role, but it was obvious she had not had much acting experience. In most of her scenes, I had difficulty hearing what she was saying. She seemed to do what most new actors do -- she spoke a little too quickly and she mumbled. Only in her voice-overs was I able to clearly hear her. I wanted to love her performance, but I didn't. I loved her character, though, and Precious is a true hero overcoming almost insurmountable odds. The film was produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, and directed by Lee Daniels. A reviewer by the name of Armond White who writes for the New York Press had this to say: "Winfrey, Perry and Daniels make an unholy triumvirate. They come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism." Another reviewer called the movie "Social pornography at its worst, festering in racial self-loathing and oblivious to a system that ignores its neediest." I felt that way too, but I think the movie touched a chord with Oprah because it must have felt slightly autobiographical for her. Mariah Carey was amazing as Precious's social worker, and she stole every scene she was in. The nuances of emotions that ran across her face and through her eyes was wonderful. Who knew Mariah Carey was such a good actress. Did she know she was such a good actress? Do we see an Oscar in her future? Well, I hope we see more roles with Mariah Carey. And of course Mo'Nique's performance was in a whole other stratosphere. She should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress. I didn't like the movie "Precious" , but then, I didn't like "The Hurt Locker" either and it won Best Picture. Maybe I need to put my rose colored glasses back on. Too often I am able to see exploitation and propaganda where other people are not. My emotions are not easily manipulated, and it kind of ruins the fun. As one reviewer said about the movie "Precious" , "There is a thin line between compassion and voyeurism; soul-searing drama and overwrought melodrama; opera and Oprah. This film tramples all over it." I'm afraid I agree... I wanted to like this movie, but I didn't care for it. I work with several Iraqi and Iranian doctors, as well as doctors from Saudia Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. They enjoy telling me stories of growing up in their countries, what their family lives were like and what is was like going to school in their home countries. Talking with them has been a real education for me so, I thought perhaps I would share some of what I have learned with folks who perhaps don't know a great deal about those mysterious places in the Middle East. Before I go any further, let me say this is not about politics, so please don't misunderstand me. I don't completely comprehend the complex politics of the Middle East, and for the purposes of this post, they are not relevant. Until 1920, the country of Iraq did not exist. It was created out of the spoils of the First World War. The Ottoman Empire was carved up and France was given mandate over Syria and Lebanon, while Great Britain was given mandate over Jordan, Palestine and Iraq, of which Baghdad is the largest city. The roots of Baghdad go back to 1200 years B.C., but in the 8th Century A.D., it became an important centre of commerce and education. One university, Bayt al-Hikmah, attracted scholars from all over the world, where students translated Greek manuscripts, preserving them for all time. It was home to great philosophers, scientists, astronomers, mathematicians, doctors, lawyers, engineers, artists, scientists and religious leaders. They studied the works of Aristotle, Plato and Hippocrates. While Europe was still in the Dark Ages, Baghdad was the centre of a rich, intellectual civilization. Today the museums in Baghdad house thousands of priceless ancient artifacts, but the museums have been closed to the public since the invasion in 2003 in order to protect the treasures. Baghdad is built on the banks of the Tigris River -- one of the four rivers from the Garden of Eden -- and it has a population of approximately 7,000,000, almost the size of New York City. Baghdad has existed through dozens of sieges over the centuries, and it will survive the current one as well. Iraq is a country with a very different culture from ours. We in North America do not fully understand it, nor are we expected to understand it. The doctors with whom I work tell me of their relig
ous traditions, their family traditions and their cultural traditions. Their customs seem so foreign to me, as my customs are foreign to them. They bring to the office wonderful things to eat -- kebbabs, bamia, falafel, dolma, and delicious pastries made with phyllo dough, pistachio nuts and honey. There are special dishes for special feasts, and some of the recipes go back 10,000 years. I find the Iraqis to be very warm, generous people and they love to hug. All I can think is how unfortunate it is when we all have so much to share, that we should spend so much time in unecessary hostilities. We here in North America can be somewhat naïve at times, and often we don't know as much about the rest of the world and the people who inhabit it as we think we do.
Dear Readers: I am busily working on my first non-fiction book, Yoga Drunk . As such the frequency of posts here will likely suffer. Currently I am in the US teaching and leading workshops. In October I travel to Austria and then to India where I will remain for six months as I complete the book. I thank you for your continued support and interest and promise to update this site as I am able and as my adventures warrant. If you need a fix, you can always follow me on Twitter (RachelRoberts).

I simply knew nothing about it, so I did not know to hope to come. I can therefore say that I am here only because yoga brought me here and for that, among a million other things, I give immense gratitude for this practice. To say this place is pretty does not begin to scratch the surface. Hvar is surrounded by the kind of blue waters that you think only Photoshop or Koolaid mix can create. The stone beaches are like bleacher seating for the beautifully tanned and Speedo-clad bodies that lie on them all day, every day. And everything smells like lavender. Hvar is famous for it’s lavender products and they are sold everywhere resulting in the lingering scent that is strong enough to even win out over the sea of cigarette smoking tanners. This town is apparently THE place to be for the month of August and with no planning on my part I find myself in the heart of Europe’s biggest summer beach party. Every night here is a cacophony of motor yachts humming, techno music blaring, wine glasses clinking, and street performers singing love-lorne ballads in Italian, French, Croatian or English. Part of the real beauty here is that there are islands everywhere. The vistas are dotted with tiny rocky outcrops, just big enough for a channel marker, up to large, mountainous landmasses shaped like a young child would draw a plump-petalled flower, the spaces in between the petals each, in fact, a secluded bay with safe anchorages and heavenly bath water swimming holes. The island of Hvar is the biggest one around and I wanted to do some exploring, so a few days ago I rented a car. Because it is prime season here, I was limited to only one option for a car. A first generation VW Beetle, painted in sparkly purple and adorned with gold flames and a lions head. Seriously, this was my rental. Now of course I acknowledge that this car was three decades past its prime. Anti-lock brakes, power steering, a radio, these were of course luxuries I could not expect to have but there was more missing from the standard line-up of generally expected auto accessories. Upon being given the keys I was warned by the rental guy that I should probably go straight to the gas station as “the fuel gauge doesn’t work so who could know how much petrol is in the tank.” While approaching the gas station I figured out that braking was not a given either. Thankfully, it was a manual and I know how to downshift, so no huge problem, however it should be noted that to engage the clutch it was helpful if you could regularly leg press 100kilos. Also, no seat belt (not a huge problem since the human Velcro effect of sweaty skin on pleather made me feel secure in my oneness with this vehicle), no roof, no way to adjust the position of the seat, which was way too close to the rally-car after-market pedals and steering wheel, and most problematically it would turn out… no lights. At the petrol station I had a momentary hesitation where I realized that this car, (and I use that term loosely) was perhaps not going to make for a fun day and that if I were wise, I would return it and reserve a real, (manufactured in this century) car for another day. Of course I put this absurd thought out of my head and headed off for points unknown. First stop Stari Grad or translated – Old Town, a well-earned name as the place was founded way back in 385 BC. Here I strolled around snapping photos of various architectural features and stopping for a perfect breakfast. I am a big fan of breakfast, in fact it is my favorite meal of the day. Back when I had a ‘normal’ life, going out with friends for a leisurely weekend breakfast was something I truly looked forward to every week. As I travel, breakfast is often my longest and largest meal of the day. So I fancy myself a bit of an expert on this building block of nutrition. In Stari Grad I had a plate of perfectly fried eggs, topped with homemade cheese and local sea salt, served with a fresh from the oven baguette and the ripest tomatoes I may have ever eaten. This breakfast masterpiece was accompanied by a perfectly crafted cappuccino and it was by far the best meal I have had here. I figured I was off to a great start and that my day would thus be assured fabulousness. There are a couple other towns near Stari Grad that I had already visited so I decided to pass them by to get into new territory on the island. The lack of braking capacity on the VW started to concern me as the road left the oceanside and started inclining rapidly. As I wound round and round and up and up I started getting a tad nervous about my return trip as this was the only road available for both the outgoing and incoming journey. Here is where my FOMS kicked in. FOMS (Fear Of Missing Something) is a term coined by my friend Bob Daniels of Durango, Colorado and it aptly describes my normal state of propulsion. So as the same little voice in my head that had though perhaps I should return this grape colored lemon of a car was saying to me – Um Rach… Do you really want to descend this mountain in second gear, relying on what little remains of this things transmission to slow your plummet to the sea? I kept crawling higher and higher, afraid I could be missing something amazing up ahead. Finally, at a vista point I saw my future, more up and therefore more steep downs to come. I gave in to better judgment and turned around. I did stay in second gear the whole time and by about the 20th switchback I figured out that the bailing wire and duct-taped lever dangling below the steering wheel was in fact the horn, which added an air of safety to my entering the blind corners. Back at sea level I decided to head west instead of south. West was less mountainous looking so it seemed a safer bet. A few kilometers in and the western road started climbing as well but soon enough I got to a tunnel, which thankfully went through, rather than over the mountains. As it turns out this tunnel was carved by a crack-pot force of, I am guessing, sugar-high Oompah Loompas. I say this because the tunnel was very short and narrow, it wound up and down as well as side to side and it was pitch black. Like, can’t see your hand in front of your face, ink black. The tunnel is a one-way affair so cars queue up and wait for the entrance light to turn green gaining them entry into this very long and winding roadway. About 100 feet into the tunnel and I realized I should turn on my lights, as I fumbled with dials and levers the cars in front of me sped away leaving me with no way to see what was ahead of me, or for that matter next to me above or below me. No matter the combination of switches, levers or buttons I pressed no lights came on, not so much as a blinker. I navigated that tunnel solely on sonar and the very infrequent flickering of headlights from the SUV barreling down on me. If I could have found my purse and used my iPhone flashlight app I would have – this would have been a miracle. The 60 seconds or so that it took me to navigate that ink black birth canal of engineering mediocrity were among the most terrifying of my life. When I emerged on the other side I parked the car and got out to verify that I was still alive and that this hadn’t been some rabbit hole into oblivion for me. The worst part of course, was that I would have to go back through the tunnel because again, there was only one road. This is when the novelty of the aubergine-colored bedazzled bug fully wore off. I was spent, fried, frazzled and seriously considering abandoning this thing right there at the mouth of the tunnel. I managed to pull it together enough to drive down into the next town, where again I got out to test the steadiness of my legs and to try every McGuiver trick in the book to get a light on this car to work. Finally, I figured out that if I pulled out all the buttons and simultaneously pulled the windshield wiper lever forwards and down the driving lights would work, this was confirmed by a kindly gentleman in a brand new Audi who upon confirming that I had about a 30 watt bulb to get me through the tunnel, wisely sped off to avoid the likely coming fiery crash. This is how I made my return passage, one shaky hand on the wheel and the other white-knuckled onto the lever and my dying flashlights of headlights blazing about a two foot path in front of me. When I got back on the safe side of that pit of despair I said aloud to myself ‘I need a drink’. Now this is a phrase I try to avoid using. My alcohol consumption has a long-history of binge and purge periods, a fact that at times makes me think I should reevaluate my relationship with fermented spirits. So if the word need enters into an alcohol-related conversation, especially a one-participant conversation such as this one, I see this as cause for reflection. However, in this instance, I approve 100% of the usage of this phrase and I affirm that I really did NEED a drink. Sadly, or maybe not, there was no place around to get one so I just kept driving. I abandoned my silly idea of exploring new parts of the island and went promptly to Vrboska. I had visited this amazingly charming town a few days before via the tourist bus, a safe, reliable transportation option that it irks me to say, cost me $88 less in cash, and one less of my nine lives, than the beguiling Beetle. When I had visited before it was a short trip of just about two hours and it had been limited to the city center. I took the opportunity to drive a flat road for a bit and ventured off to the beach. Now’s a good time to point out that here on Hvar clothing seems to be very optional. Stores here that sell bathing suits have an over-abundance of tops and a serious shortage of bottoms, since everyone knows tops are an unnecessary accessory. Often it seems bottoms are over-kill as well. I mention this because when I found the beach it was located alongside a campground named, Kamp Nudist. You know I had to check this out. I mean if pretty much every other person is already naked, what on earth could camp nudist have to offer? The answer of course… naked activities. Naked windsurfing, speedboat rentals, vollyball, snorkeling, and bicycling. I will refrain from further comment on this delightful little quick-dry oasis, but I will make one generalization. This was the most cumulatively attractive and well-groomed group of people I have ever seen. After a few hours of de-stressing oceanside I opted to drive back to Hvar for the night giving myself plenty of daylight for the journey. I returned the car and told the rental shop proprietor of my concerns for the safety of others should he continue to rent this sparkly plum deathtrap. He took the keys, smiled from behind his twenty-something year-old eyes and simply said “lady, it’s like 35 years old… what can you expect.” I chose to let this last comment slide right by me, after all I am 36. Update: Check out the new This End Up Yoga site at www.thisendupyoga.com My teachers Sandra and Marco sent me an email a few months ago asking if I wanted to Shantisit (watch their cocker spaniel Shanti) for the month of August. I said yes before I really knew any of the details. Free rent and the lure of the Croatian coastline seemed all the incentive I needed. This has turned out to be another one of those times, where through no planning on my part I have ended up at the perfect place at the perfect time. Shanti spends his summers on the stunningly beautiful island of Hvar on the Dalmatian coast and so it is here that we are spending our days tanning, swimming, writing and napping. Hvar is a medieval city, a fort looms above and fortress wall still surround the main part of town. All of the old world charm is still here, cobblestone streets, narrow alleyways, gated entrances, but mixed with the ancient is the new, or more specifically the Nuevo Riche. Hvar is a playground for super yachts and the Louis Vuitton beach bag-toting crowd. Everyone here is beautiful and beautifully clothed, assuming they are wearing clothes. I am surrounded by six foot-tall supermodel types and naked overly groomed men. There is definite agenda each day you are on Hvar. It begins around noon when everyone hits the beach. They all seem to be entered into some kind of competitive tan-off and try as I might, my Arian roots are betraying me. I cannot hang with the naturally olive-skinned crowd when it comes to tanning. Clothing is very optional and tan lines are almost non-existent. Late afternoon the crowds gravitate towards one of the beach-side discos for the first party of the day. From four until sunset the symphony of 80’s and 90’s techno pop is deafening. The Hvar vacationers are prepared for the transition from beach to dance club and they don bedazzled crepe cover ups and produce the latest shoe fashions, 4” heels or gladiator sandals, from their beach bags for the occasion. The transformation is mesmerizing and could give any Broadway quick-change artist a run for their money. From sunset until 11pm I must assume that people nap and primp, because no one goes out to dinner before 10:30. Cocktail hour begins around midnight and the dance club built in the ruins of an old fortification opens around 2am. Again, I cannot hang. I feel old when I try to meet up with some of the other yoga instructors for dinner and drinks. They take pity on the grandma of the group and opt for the Hvar equivalent of the early-bird special, eating at ten. We begin cocktail hour at 11 and by 12:30 I have turned into a pumpkin sneaking away to the flat and a warm bed complete with my handsome cocker spaniel date. Even though I can’t keep the late night hours I have started sleeping in later and later. For most of my trip, regardless of time zone I woke up with the sun. Here, I often sleep until nine. I wake up, take Shanti for a walk, usually down to the water for a morning swim. Then I take advantage of having a kitchen at my disposal and make myself breakfast. My afternoons are filled with tanning, exploring and writing. I have dedicated this month to writing a book proposal and so far I have been diligent, motivated and borderline obsessive in this endeavor. My teachers have a yoga space here and most nights I go to it, sometimes to lead a class but most often to take one led by their new crop of yoga teaching trainees. Getting to live and practice in their space, their energy is inspiring for me and I am loving the time on my mat. When I left France I made a statement that I would get to Croatia and get back to clean living, no cheese, no wine, no more bottomless espressos, back to my ‘normal’ asana and meditation routine, etc. No such luck. Because I never bothered to research where I was spending August, I didn’t realize that I am on an island famous for its wine production and in a country whose national foods seem to mirror those of Italy and France: pasta, pizza, baguettes, formagio, gellato. And my beloved Italian-born teacher Marc
 of course has an Espresso machine in the flat, which I am powerless to walk past without firing up. Never one to go against local customs I have been eating pizza most days and making nightly stops at the local wine bars. I am an international ambassador for good, if not necessarily the yogi ideal. Hvar is a cultural haven as well as a hedonistic one. There are frequent outdoor concerts held in the sacristy of an ancient convent, I attended my first Sunday night, a jazz quintet. The Piazza is filled with musicians each night and local artisans set up kiosks featuring their paintings, hand made lace and lavender creations. All in all it really is pretty much heaven. The town is dripping with European charm and entertaining locals, the water marvels the most beautiful blues I have ever seen and there are no bugs. I repeat… no bugs. In the ten days I have been here I have suffered not a single mosquito bite. I may never leave. 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;} A student from the last retreat I did in Bali offered us her Paris flat for the week. Martina’s beautiful home was the most amazing gift! To have an apartment in the city, complete with kitchen, lift and satellite feed of Le Tour, was beyond anything we could have asked for. From Martina’s flat we set out daily to explore Paris’ sights and gastronomical delights. Kristin only had one full day in the city before her return flight to Denver. On that day we must have covered ten miles of landmarks, the Lovre, Notre Dame, Sangre de Criste, Eiffel Tower, the Champs, on and on. The next morning at an ungodly early hour I hugged my dear friend goodbye, put her in a cab and went promptly back to bed. Two hours later I got a text. - U won’t believe this. Don’t have a seat on the flight – Expedia f-ed up. Next is not until Fri, so might as well stay 2 Sun. B back in 30.” Well as Kristin’s wise uncle once told us “when life gives you lemons… throw them out and buy a bottle of champagne.” So we did. The next day we hired a car and headed off for the Champagne region. The car was not available until 2pm, but no worry our first stop was to be a small town with Champagne in its name, just a short two-hour drive from the city, so we would be toasting by 4:30 at the latest. We arrived only to find no champagne, no grapes, no bottles, nada, only yet another cathedral which we obligingly explored. After about an hour we found our way to the tourist info office and learned that we needed to go 40 minutes back the way we had come to a town called Epernay, the home of Avenue de Champagne. When we arrived on Champagne Avenue it was already close to 7pm and all the Champagne houses were closed. Signs announcing Moet and Dom Perignon mocked us from above sealed doors. The only open bar we could find boasted Heineken umbrellas and dozens of beers on tap. Parched we found a wine store and bought a split to wet our whistles. We walked into the center of town and popped the cork. I went to lift the bottle to my lips when I spied a man staring at me with a look of absolute horror. He came over and told us that it was unacceptable to drink like this and told us to stay put for a moment. Unsure if I was about to be arrested for public consumption I waited. Henri returned with two champagne glasses from his flat. He gave them to us to keep as a souvenir and made us promise to never again defile his country’s nectar of the gods in such a hedonistic manner. We promised. The ensuing hours we my absolute favorite in France. Our car plodded on back to Paris and along the way we visited a local winemaker's house bought three bottles and kept going. At the most beautiful part of the evening we stopped at a solitary church and cemetery where we took hundreds of soft-lighted photos of ancient headstones backed by vineyards of champagne grapes. The past and the future intrinsically entertained. Those who originally planted the vines, now resting among them for eternity. It was a truly amazing day and one I will not soon forget. Over the course of the next few days we visited Versaille, the Grande Palace, the Petit Palace, more cathedrals, more landmarks, retail stores we could not afford, bistros we barely could and then we took a whole day to stay indoors, watch the Tour and an entire HBO series. That day was fantastic too. While it may seem wasteful to while away a whole Parisian day indoors, the truth was we were beat. Saturday we moved to Roberto’s hotel to await his arrival. A nightcap with him and a quick sleep and it was time for Kristin to leave me for real. KR – Best. Vacation. Ever. Love you and I will celebrate with you anywhere, every year. TDF I had never even heard of road biking or the Tour until maybe ten years ago. By that time though, I was already good friends with Roberto. And so my path to Paris had already begun to unfold. We were friends for probably an entire year before I really figured out who he was to cycling fans. I remember that day vividly. Roberto and I were walking down Main Street in Durango, Colorado on our way to lunch when a nice, sane-enough-looking man in his thirties came running across the road to us, he fell to his knees and started prostrating to Roberto, all the while yelling “Bobke, Bobke you’re the man!” I stood there a bit on the bewildered side. Once prostrating man had paid his cycling penance, Roberto resumed our forward progression. I stopped and asked him to please explain. That is how I learned that my friend, neighbor and standing Thursday dinner date was kind of famous. This revelation did little to alter our friendship, as I was not into cycling at the time and already regarded Roberto as part of the fabric of my life, pauper or prince made no matter to me. Then a year later he started commentating for the network that covers the Tour and so obligingly as one good friend wanting to support another, I upped my Comcast Cable plan to include the obscure sports channel he was working for and so began what was once a fleeting fascination and is now bordering on fanaticism. Since then, there was only one year where Roberto did not go to France to announce the race for the entire US, that year he sat on my couch in Durango and commentated the Tour, right there in my living room, for the benefit of just myself and my father who happed to be in town. I remember marveling at how he could possibly know that the white and red polka-dotted speck hundreds of feet below the helicopter camera was a cyclist much less some Eastern European man with a multi-multi-syllabic last name who was killing it up the mountains. From that day I dare say I was hooked on le Tour and even more enamored of my dear friend. Not because of ‘who’ he is to Tour fans, but because I got to see him in person doing something he is really, really good at. About five years ago Roberto started inviting me to tag along with him to France. At the time I was subjected to a woefully inadequate two weeks of vacation time per year and really couldn’t envision myself here. But that all changed in 2008. I came here last year for a week and now I am sitting on a rooftop in Paris, watching the minutes tick by before my guest pass allows me access to the Champs where I will watch the final stage of the 2009 Tour. For the last three weeks I have used the, ‘but I am going there!” card to overrule the television choices of my parents, strangers in sports bars, and those hosting me in their homes. This last week in France I subjected poor Kristin to my audible rantings at the live BBC radio feed’s inability to perfectly sync up with Eruo Sports TV programming and the official Tour site’s live blogging. In an attempt to help her gain interest and thereby assuage my guilt from keeping her indoors, I would commentate for her. I’d tell her why being number one or 21 or 51 was important, what the different jerseys signified, what category climbs were and so on. From the helicopter shots I would say things like, third one back in white… that’s Hincapie he’s only worn the yellow jersey once before, so he is going to give it all he’s got… there he goes, or “ Schleck’s going to go again… See told you ” Basically, now I acknowledge that I am a fan in the truest sense. I love this event, I honestly think it is the most amazing sporting event we have going. And my absolutely favorite part of le Tour de France happens in a few short hours. When the race is over. After the awards are doled out, each team does ‘victory’ laps around the Champs. Can you imagine what that must be like? Twenty-one days, something like 80 hours in the saddle, countless hours of preparation, strategizing, abject suffering and then whe it’s all over, to be riding with your teammates, knowing what you just accomplished, cheered on by thousands… whether you are wearing the Maillot Jaune (overall winner) or the Lanterne Rouge (last place), you are a bad ass who has accomplished something only the most select few can ever dream of. And I applaud you all. As I sit for hours in different corners of the world meditating, trying to obtain single-minded focus I often think about all the other paths to Samadhi. For many, and I dare say for all of these riders, exercise, physical endurance is their path,. I can’t imagine that when you are climbing up a beyond category mountain stage there is much room for the monkey mind to intrude. I can see the yoga in it, I see the Tapas the meditation and maybe that is why I so love this sport! 0 false 18 pt 18 pt 0 0 false false false /- Style Definitions -/ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} The Biagetti family reunion took place in a small region of Italy about two hours south of Bologna and twenty minutes from the coast. It was like stepping back into a simpler time where families ate together every night, meals lasted three hours and no one was in any hurry to move on. The Biagetti family is large in numbers and mammoth in heart. For four days we ate, we laughed and we lounged poolside at a ridiculously gorgeous villa that slept the 17 of us Americans who had come to Italy and hosted the 30 others who would stop by throughout each day. On the mornings that I was not weighed down too much by pasta, pizza or Rose, I awoke to do my practice on a patio overlooking sunflower fields and lavender bushes. It was a dream. Kristen and I have birthdays one day apart (which is a big part of why I am here at all), also her cousin Libby and I share our birthday, so with three people turning older during the week we had plenty of cause to celebrate. The villa we all stayed in is owned by a man named Ercole (Italian for Hercules) who along with being an Italian Innkeeper is a famous florist – he does the flowers for Vanity Fair’s annual Oscar party among others. So on this birthday, my 36 th , Libby’s 17 th and Kristin’s (let’s call it) 29 th , Ercole the florist to the stars decorated a heavenly confection for us girls and then he graciously provided most of the entertainment for the night. As Kristin’s Aunt Lisa perhaps put it best, "Ercole is such fun you find yourself wanting to make sure he like you.” Kristin and I asked to be his floral assistants at next year’s Oscars. I’m afraid we might not have conveyed this desire strongly enough, but you never know where the two of us might turn up. The four days that I spent with the Biagettis were so filled with love that I can barely convey how overwhelmed I was to be with them all. Italy has always been special to me, I am a chunk Italian myself and each time I arrive in this country I feel instantly happy and grounded. This time I realized part of why that is, Italy is love, it is all heart and passion and comfort. Ciao Bella Italiano. Then we were on the move again, off to Spain, likely the only new country for me on this leg of my travels. Neither Kristin nor I had ever been to Barcelona before and what better reason to visit. Leading up to this trip Kristin was deep in planning for her time in Africa and I was moving my base from Colorado to Ohio. Because we were both so tied up with other tasks we never really did any planning beyond Italy – other than buying plane tickets. This has proven to be really fun, in that we have no expectations so when we stumble on Cathedral Sagrada Familia four blocks from our barely-researched-yet-perfect-for-us hotel, we smile and think of ourselves as leading charmed lives. Then some days we get hopelessly lost, spend a small fortune we could have avoided if we had invested in a guidebook and generally make international arses of ourselves. While in Spain we followed in the footsteps of architect Antoni Gaudi whose macabre textural style compelled us from one building to the next and finally to the surrounding the home where he lived for twenty years. Each day in Spain we would get up at some very civilized late-morning hour and then pretty much just randomly head out, blissfully unknowing of what we might stumble upon. Of course this method of travel comes with mixed levels of success. The stumbling approach led us to a market where to “save money” we decided to eat at a stall, which we assumed would be cheaper than a sit-down restaurant. That lunch ran us about $60, which was decidedly more than the previous day’s sit-down lunch. But all-in-all the stumble approach treated us well. When you don’t know what to expect… you have no expectations so you are often pleasantly surprised. One night we stumbled out way past dark. We had a beer here, a glass of vino there until finally we tripped right into a very short man who looked like he was impersonating Prince, assuming Prince ever wore red sequins and rode a flower-covered bike. Prince Jr. led us to our final bar of the night where two very drunk Irishmen bought our drinks because, exactly a year before, I had visited their home town of Letterkenny (thanks cousin Shannon for that one). High off free booze we stumbled home past street performers of every shape and size. Kristin calls them Buskers, a new term for me but one she says is widely used. Men and women laden with latex paints, oil-based makeup and non-breathing fabrics mime, mimic and dance their way to Euros from the passersby. Earlier in the day on La Ramba, a.k.a. Busker Row, I saw a man wearing just a black Speedo walking down the street, odd because there is no beach there. People were staring at him gape-mouthed and upon further review I realized his Speedo was actually a tattoo. Some quick deduction and I screamed “Kristin! Look at that man!” upon which we began chasing after him cameras at the ready. The crowd in front began parting, women gasped, men looked dejected and once we rounded the bend we saw why. He was HUGE. I mean like… good luck finding a woman who would think that was a good time HUGE! And not only that but he was entirely tattooed – entirely! Not really sure how to segue smoothly here so I will move on to a topic not related to size but rather to eyes. I fell deeply in love with Spain, yes because it is beautiful and because Barcelona is so cosmopolitan and historic at the same time, but mainly I fell in love with Spanish men. (Elephant man mentioned above, notwithstanding.) If I love Italy because of its people’s hearts, I love Spain because of its people’s eyes. Tall, thin, mocha-complexioned men with hazel eyes are everywhere. I was actually uncomfortable in the pre
Here's a great post from Micah about sending on her 18 jeans! :) ~Jenn --------------- Tuesday, March 16, 2010 &nbsp; It is time to say good bye to a good friend.

Seems fitting that fatty would chose to wear me for the last time to the school carnival. There was a little change however. About 24 pounds worth of change that is. Apparently my fatty was serious about this whole weight loss thing. I am proud to say that she has stuck to her guns, and worked her butt off.... literally!

Ok, recently? Today, I wanted to SOOOO bad! Some of you may remember a few weeks ago I decided to weigh in at the gym, just to see if my scale at home was off. And, BOY was it EVER! It had me well over 330. It was at that time that I waged a war with the ding dong scale. I swore I would never touch it again, if it was going to be so hateful. But, alas I could not stay away from it. I kept weighing in under 230 at home, and over that at the gym. Instead of being discouraged, I just took a step back, and started going with the scale at home. (I mean please, it had a better weight, who wants to deal with reality) It has been about 3 or 4 week since I got on the scale at the gym. But, then it has been about 3 weeks since I have been at the gym consistently. I have had frigid cold temps, and sick kids, and no time to go the gym. So, today when I moseyed on into the lovely gym to do my work out, I thought I would tackle the dumb scale today. I'm not scared! So, on my way out, I put my stuff down, hopped on the scale.... and.....I almost passed out AGAIN! Only this time, I am proud to announce, the scale happened to be at 216.5!!!!!!! I skipped the 220's! If I could have done cartwheels with out seriously hurting myself (because when you are 30 or over, you just should not do them anymore) I so would have! I am so excited!!!! As for the jeans (you know, the fabulous size 18's that MrsFatAss sent me from the bloggerhood ) that I like to strut around in, well they are still doing good! However, I can still wear them, and they are NOT falling off yet, which bums me out. I really would like to be in a smaller size once I send them on in a month. (can you believe that it has been a month already?) But, I cannot be to upset, 19.5 pounds in a month.... not to shabby! Be sure to check out Sue's blog here ! Fatty has a good Christmas My dearest comrades, (otherwise known as the bloggerhood jeans ) I come to you today, after about two weeks of family fun, food and craziness to tell you my fatty has lost 11 pounds. It is unheard of I know for a fatty to loose weight during the holiday season, but mine did! Ok, so lets back up a bit, and I will tell you the adventures that I have been on in the last two weeks. After our trip to the 4th grade Christmas party, fatty had a much needed vacation at home with her two adorable little non-fatty kids. They had Christmas cheer at Church, where fatty wore me to dinner. And her little Christian buns owned that sanctuary! And yes, she showed it to her friends. (Please note tho, I might say she "owned it" but she did not strut or flaunt, because that is not like MY fatty, she is way to proper for that.) The week leading up to Christmas consisted of shopping for the little non -fattys with her fabulous "other half of we" a trip to her favorite Mexican Restaurant, PMS (which, despite a few much needed, get out of my way or I will hurt you trips to Sonic Happy Hour for a large Cherry Coke, was very uneventful as far as the high caloric, high fructose corn syrup cravings are concerned) and a trip in a blizzard to Kansas City,Missouri with the whole fatty clan. That was fun! She wore me out to a fun dinner with her clan for Christmas dinner, in a blizzard in which she walked for three blocks to a restaurant that was supposed to be open but due to weather was not, and then back another two blocks to the place that she ended up eating (but only because it was the ONLY place crazy enough to be open). All was not lost though, it turned out to be a fun memory making trip, and the dinner was even good. She ate a spinach salad! And then walked back to the and WORKED OUT! I was so proud of my fatty! Then, the next week she wore me out for New Years Eve! Where again, she ate a spinach salad. She rocked the buns with her "other half of we" to hear her favorite local band of all time Bakerville. Boy, what a fun couple of weeks this fatty and I have had together. My friends, I hope that you all have had an equally good time sporting your fatty's buns during this holiday season. Here's to a fabulous 2010! Until next time my friends. Size 18 jeans (not 16) Fatty wears me to a Christmas Party. My fellow comrades, Today my Fatty-bo-batty (or FBB for short) wore me out of the house for the first time since I arrived, and it was about stinkin time! Where did my FBB take me you ask? Out for a Sonic Happy Hour drink? Out to eat? Out for ice cream? Out to shop? Nope.... she took me to a fourth grade Christmas party. At first I was appalled. Why would I, fabulous jeans, you know, the ones that make her buns look squeezable and AWESOME want to go to a fourth grade party? I mean come on! Fourth graders have not had two kids. They could care less that I have to squeeze some full figured 5'10" 220 something pound FBB into my outstanding material. But, oh well. I walked her fabulous buns into that class room, and followed every move she made. And, to top it all off, she did not even enjoy the buffet of high fructose corn syrup. (well, maybe just one little cookie). She did not drink a soda today, or eat wee little donuts. No sweet tea, chocolate candy, suckers, potato chips, dips or anything. I tell you what fellow bloggerhood jeans, my FBB kicked some major high fructose corn syrup butt today! I felt honored to make her buns look good! Well, it is time for her to take me off now....she needs to put on her sweat pants and big baggy shirt, because she can't breath! I will write more the next time she decides to take me out. And I will try to get her to take a picture of me....and her buns! :) Until then, good luck! With love, Bloggerhood size 16 jeans Our darling Micah got the size 16 jeans from Sue ! I'm super excited about her journey over the next two months, and I wish her a ton of luck in getting too skinny for the sixteens, baby! Here's her blog post about the package. :) ~Jenn ---------------------------- They are here!! Said jeans appeared in my mailbox on Monday, and it was so fun! I felt like a little kid seeing that package. I hurried inside and opened my package from Sue. She is so sweet! She put fun confetti in the package, and some candy canes (which if you saw the video, you know I don't have to feel bad for eating them). I took pictures...I just could not help myself. So, now we get down to business. Can she fit into the size 16 jeans, as hoped. --- SIDE NOTE--- I really wanted to take some pictures in the jeans out in Dewey so you all could see our cute little town, and so you could see all the fun thing that the jeans are getting to do... but it was REALLY cold when they got here, and I was not doing muffin top shots outside...so you get to see my bedroom instead! :) With promises to see fun places with me in the jeans! Ok, so here goes (and I really can not believe that I took these pictures, and I really can not believe that I am SHOWING them online! Ok...so there you go! They fit, but snug. I could wear them, but would really be comfortable after about day three when they are nice and stretched. But, I have incredible support here at home, and some really supportive friends, so FATTY BO BATTY BE GONE! Can't wait to see what happens after two months. Good luck to all the other Bloggerhood sisters!
Sandra has written a 3BT post at Living in 22 . Have a look at the rest of her blog -- she has some wonderful photos of garden birds. 1. I get a coffee and line up my week's work in my notebook. 2. I like to hear the robin chipping-chipping away -- he sits (small and bellicose) in the conifer outside the window to guard the coconut shell filled with fat and seeds. 3. We have moved the kitchen table round to give more space in the kitchen, and now instead of sitting face-to-face, we sit side-by-side. I wasn't keen because I thought it would make conversation awkward. It doesn't really; and now we tend to turn our chairs at the end of the meal to spend some time cuddling and chatting. Here are my favourite 3BT posts for the week. Lynn plays the glad game . Penelope's daughter sees the joy in a banana . Eyebee has something nice for breakfast . Leonora fills her hands and empties her head . Bag Lady will never be short of work . Whitney takes a holiday . Spring has come for Merope's dogs . Louisa's new dog has her dancing to a different rhythm . Sprite's birthday presents are handmade with love . Confucian bells ring true for Plutarch, and a toad reminds him of national service . Genny hears some satisfying gossip . It's spring for lucky Joe in Vegas . 1. We visit Nick's parents, and find them in good spirits. When I write that, I feel like a historic diarist -- my whaler's wife, or Anne Huges from Diary of a Farmer's Wife . 2. I like to bring bedding in off the line -- it always smells better than any detergent ever could. It's a cold smell that fills the vault of my head and makes me think of light and shadow. 3. We've recorded HMS Pinafore -- it's good, once in a while, to sing along with an opera, to make comments about the costumes and to stop the action for a pee break. It's Mothering Sunday today -- hope all the mothers out there are feeling appreciated. We're off to see Nick's later; and I feel very thankful to mine for her help with moving yet more stuff into storage, and for cleaning up the kitchen window so Nick could paint it. 1. Two teenage girls, arm in arm, shuffle noisily through the shopping centre -- one is wearing sloppy sheep skin boots, and the other a pair of badly fitting ballet flats. 2. I come home from shopping and Nick gives me the thumbs up as I pass the window. "The viewer used the b-word!" My mind races: Boring? Blue? Bogus? Bollocks? "Big! She said it was big." 3. We sit in the window of a pub on the Pantiles and people of all ages and sizes pass -- some briskly, some dawdling with phones and pushchairs -- with bunches of flowers. 1. "What do I do with these?" The tip attendant puts his hands out for my broken electricals, and gives me such a beautiful, bright smile. 2. Newly painted window frames. Dark outside. It's almost a treat to stand here and do the washing up. 3. Poorly husband goes to bed early. Wife stays up and plays Zelda: Twilight Princess . . If you are hoping your blog will bring in a little extra income by way of that ugly word monetisation , selling advertising is one way to go about it. But it's hard for us mere mortals to get access to the people who are actually willing to pay up. Ebuzzing is a platform that has just launched in the UK. It gives bloggers an 'in' with big business advertisers who are keen to promote on blogs. The promotion takes the form of blog posts -- clearly marked 'sponsored' -- and videos both in dedicated players and in banners (again, marked with the name of the advertiser). Here's a video campaign in a banner -- the set-up appears similar to Adsense, and it seems as if it might be a good alternative. It's free to register on ebuzzing.com -- it took me minutes (I had my stats handy, though), and 3BT was approved within the hour. You then sign up for a campaign that appeals, read the brief and write a post. Your text is looked over by Ebuzzing and once approved, you can make it live. Now to the big question -- money. Looking down the list of campaigns I've been offered: most seem to pay €40 for a short post, and I'm getting a bit more for this one. This strikes me as better than a poke in the eye. Ebuzzing lists some big names among its clients: Coca-Cola, Intel, MTV, MasterCard, Toyota, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, eBay, Canon, Diesel, Warner Bros and Philips. If these guys have got money spend on blog advertising, I'm willing to earn it -- what about you? Sponsored Post Hi Everyone I've been offered the chance to write paid-for posts on 3BT, and with things being the way they are, I don't want to turn down the money. The posts will be marked as sponsored posts, and it will be clear that's what they are, as they will be in a totally different style to 3BT. I am planning to write one a month. The main reason I've been offered this is because of you, my readers, who are kind enough to turn up regularly, read what I have to say and write comments. I'm hoping the extra money will allow me to dedicate a little more time and energy to 3BT, and in that way benefit you, too. Clare I had the pleasure of interviewing artist Lesley Featherstone recently about an exhibition of her pictures at Trinity and Town and Country Foundation Gallery that runs until March 14. She also ran some workshops for women at the gallery. Lesley emailed me to say that she thought the article was a beautiful thing, which tickled me immensely. She added: "The other was the incredible women at the workshop Monday. The third was putting it up with Jane." Jane is Jane Churchill, who runs the gallery, and she's a very lovely (but busy) person -- I'd really like to interview her one of these days, too! The podcast is up . 1. I look up to see the dustman passing the window where I am working. The fourth time he passes (on his way back from replacing our bin) we exchange half nods. 2. I am making a ginger cake, and I am mystified by the instruction to add a certain weight of golden syrup and treacle. I picture myself standing there until Turpentine Sunday while the spoon dribbles a thread of syrup and the weight goes up gramme by gramme. I am so glad to remember my mother's tip -- stand the tin on the scales, and spoon out syrup until the weight drops by the amount you need. 3. At 7pm, Nick takes the pie he has baked for our supper out of the oven. He brings it into the sitting room to show me. 1. My mother scrubs the mould off our kitchen window frame. 2. Stuffing sacks of old clothes into the recycling bin. The hopper closes with a polite clang. 3.&nbsp;A pair of palm-sized portobello mushrooms in our vegetable box. Their dense flesh looks like real food. I imagine how a hunter-gather would have felt to find them on her patch. Perhaps she would have smiled and thought: "That's supper sorted."

I will be expecting you on your magic bubble or will you be coming on the beautiful Owlbert ? licks and sniffs, Sasha I was just being curious, that is my defense. I am sitting by the back door watching for squirrels. Mommy has let me out on the deck before and I always come right back in with her. She went out to do put a cover on our outside stove cooker griller thing and I decided it was time for me to explore the lay of the land. I wanted to see the backyard on my own, I am a big girl now. Come on Mommy please let me out, I won't do anything sassy (giggles and paws crossed behind my back) Just open the door and you will see how good I am. As soon as she opened the door, down the stairs I went. Our backyard leads to something called a 'marsh" I don't know what that is except that it is wet back there. I decided to run like the wind to the front yard. Mommy had to run to try to catch me and with her bad back, she couldn't run too fast. By the time she caught up to me I was in the road in front of our house barking at some kids on skate boards telling them to knock it off. Mommy caught me there. Why was she so mad at me?? I was just being curious. Now I can't go out by myself at all and I am grounded, so no parties for me for a while. I will try to change her mind, cause turkey day is coming and I don't want to be in trouble for that. Can you talk to her?? Please???? I am not exactly sure what grounded is, but I know she is pretty mad at me and I don't like that at all. licks and sniffs Sasha ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ p.s. can you send treats, I think grounded means no treats, shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sasha really scared me when she ran off and especially when I found her in the road. I know better then to ever let her out there without a leash again, but in the past she has been very good and stayed with me on our deck. Lesson learned and don't worry she is still getting plenty of treats. Anne Please go and visit Bozo at Pet pride for more pets doing fun stuff! Bozo also keeps track of birthdays and lets us know who to celebrate with. Some days , you just don't feel like getting up. Have a fun and lazy day. licks and sniffs, Sasha p.s. Mom wants me to ask you to visit her Comfort Food blog and check out the cookie recipe exchange. Ok so I did and now I'm done and back to sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Hi my pals. When I had my recent trip(nightmare) to see the Vet Lady, Mom found this article. Some of you may already know about this. You can never be too careful with us pets. The Vet Lady said it would be ok to give me a baby aspirin(81mg) if I needed cause my paw was infected. "Tylenol and Your Pets ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a pain killer and anti-fever medication commonly taken by people for minor aches and pains, fever, and soreness from arthritis. It is also a common ingredient in many children’s cough and flu medications. Because it is so regularly used in humans, most people believe that it is safe for their pet. This is incorrect. Tylenol is extremely toxic in cats, and can be toxic to dogs as well. Cats are more frequently affected because they lack an enzyme pathway that functions to metabolize the drug properly. As little as ½ tablet of Tylenol can be fatal in cats, and although a higher dose is usually required to be toxic to dogs, many can get severely ill with a low dose. Tylenol causes damage to the liver as well as to the blood cells in both species, and clinical signs can include depression, rapid breathing, dark colored gums, swelling of the face, paws, and limbs, vomiting, drooling and death. The safest way to avoid potential fatal reactions from Tylenol is to NEVER give it to your pet, even in very small amounts. Keep all bottles of Tylenol or other acetaminophen containing products in a securely closed cupboard or medicine cabinet to avoid spillage. If you think your pet is in pain, contact your veterinarian before giving any pain medications at home. It could save your pets life!

Dr. Yuill currently shares her home with a Boston terrier, a Pug, 2 cats, 2 budgies and her husband Charles. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here are some people foods that we should not eat: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Grapes and raisins Contain an unknown toxin, which can damage the kidneys. There have been no problems associated with grape seed extract. Onions and garlic (raw, cooked, or powder) Contain sulfoxides and disulfides , which can damage red blood cells and cause anemia . Cats are more susceptible than dogs. Garlic is less toxic than onions. Xylitol (artificial sweetener) Can cause liver failure. Mushrooms Can contain toxins, which may affect multiple systems in the body, cause shock, and result in death. Macadamia nuts Contain an unknown toxin, which can affect the digestive and nervous systems and muscle. Chocolate, coffee, tea, and other caffeine Contain caffeine, theobromine , or theophylline , which can be toxic and affect the heart and nervous systems. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ With the holidays coming, we need to be careful and try not to get into some of the people foods that could make us sick. Cheese however, seems to be just fine, thank you very much. Be safe and lets stay healthy! licks and sniffs, Sasha Hi my pals. It was kind of boring around here this weekend. My Daddy was sick and of course I was on duty to take care of him. He didn't feel like playing with me. Here I am making sure that he stays calm and rests while he was watching football on Saturday "Stay down Daddy, I am here to take care of you. Do you think Mommy could bring us some get well cookies?"" What Daddy, you don't feel like cookies?" Thats ok , I will be happy to eat them for you." It is a very hard job taking care of sick peoples. I can't wait until Daddy can play with me again. He plays the best games with me. I love my Daddy. I hope you all had a nice weekend. I am getting very excited for Thanksgiving. It is my favorite meal of the whole year. What is your favorite food on Thanksgiving?? Mine is mashed potatoes... yummm . The Wisconsin Badgers beat Michigan!! Congratulations to Brutus and the Ohio Buckeyes for their great victory! licks and sniffs, Sasha Hi my pals. I am trying to go to sleep and I am thinking about the things I might dream about. Sometimes I have bad puppy dreams and make woofy sounds and kick my legs(Mommy says). I hope I don't have one of those tonight. I would like to dream of a place where all my doggy pals and all my people pals can live together and no one ever gets sick. We will have such fun, running and playing. In this magic place there will be lots and lots of cheese and no shots and no sickness. I will call this place " Sashacheeseland". Will you come join me there? Free cheese for all! Cheese...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Here is another little joke I got from another Uncle, I hope it makes you smile. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -The Silent Generation are people born before 1946. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -The Baby Boomers are people born between 1946 and 1959. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -Generation X are people born between 1960 and 1979. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Generation Y are people born between 1980 and 1995. Why do we call the last one generation Y? I did not know, but a cartoonist explains it eloquently below...I Learned something new today! licks and sniffs Sasha Please visit Bozo at Pet pride for pictures of pets and pals all over the place. I am feeling a little dazed here after my Vet Lady ordeal, but even still I agreed to pose for a photo. Well Mommy was holding a piece of cheese out, so that was my focal point. After my horrible haircut experience, they had the nerve to put a shirt on me. Even though I wasn't feeling well, it only took me 2 minutes to work my way out of it when I got home. Here I am half way off. If you roll around I find it slips right off. licks and sniffs, Sasha Please visit Camera Critters Meme to see oodles of fun pictures of all kinds of animals doing all kinds of stuff. Hi my pals. I am feeling better today. I was pretty sick for a couple of days. The Vet Lady said it was a reaction to the shots and also the infection in my system. Well if the shots were gonna make me sick, why did she give em to me?? I don't know about that shot thing anymore. I am better and back to my old sassy self. Here I am feeling down still. Pay no attention to the back round. I am in a room that is being fixed up and changed and all that. I am trying to gather enough strength to play with my favorite squeaky hot dog . After that I went back to sleep. For the rest of this post I am going to show you a nice walky I took with my Big Sis before the dreaded haircut and "shots". The first one is a picture of the house where the meanest dog alive lives. Her name is Bridget. I would have Big Sis take a picture of her, but I am afraid the camera would explode with her ugliness and melt and dissolve. Ahhh a lovely morning walky. Ok, back home. I need to go in and check on Mommy. I can't stand to be away from her for very long. She needs me. Ok anytime now. My Mom is in there and more important my good girl treat awaits. Thank you for all of your good wishes, I love you my pals. licks and sniffs, Sasha
Two LA Landmarks: Pacific Dining Car and Langer's Remember the 80s? We didn't walk; we power walked. We didn't eat breakfast or lunch. We had a power breakfast or a power lunch. And a suit wasn't a suit. That's right. It was a power suit. The whole thing made me want to power vomit. When a friend invited me for breakfast at the venerable Pacific Dining Car in downtown LA, my first thought was, "What should I wear?" I considered wearing a power suit (or at least a power jacket) while we ate our power breakfasts, but settled on a look that was more casual Friday than uptight Tuesday. After all, I figured the ultimate power comes from having a flexible schedule that allows you to take off the morning for a downtown breakfast outing. Sure enough, all of the other diners were dressed in suits and ties and gazed at spreadsheets and pie charts between sips of coffee from a china cup. To fit in, dining companion and I studied Jonathan Gold's list of 99 Things to Eat Before You Die while we developed a strategy for our next take over of a restaurant. I hadn't set foot in the Pacific Dining Car since the 80s, when I worked downtown as a briefcase-lugging corporate drone. I was happy to see that it hasn't changed a bit. Some icons become stodgy over time, but not the Pacific Dining Car. It still looks and feels fresh and elegant, refined and special with its rich colors, linen table cloths and fine china and silver. Butter rosettes and a fresh rose at every table I ordered the breakfast hash, which is made from the left over steaks from the night before. Unlike most hashes, which tend to be at least 50% potato, this one was 85% steak and 15% potato, all swimming in a rich, savory gravy. It came topped with a poached egg and two biscuits on the side. Power breakfast indeed. Dining companion went for the Cajun style eggs benedict, featuring sauteed mushrooms and a crab cake instead of Canadian bacon. After our two-hour breakfast, we realized that it was time for lunch. So we did what any food-loving duo would do: we traveled a few blocks away to Langer's to try one of their legendary pastrami sandwiches. When the sandwiches arrived, the first thing I noticed was the warm bread. Then when I bit into the sandwich, I immediately noticed the crisp, chewy crust. I was enraptured. Apparently, this is what rye bread is all about. Why doesn't everyone do it this way? We packed up our sandwiches to go, and I vowed that I wasn't ever going to eat again. That is until I returned home and that rye bread started calling my name. Of course, I did what any good girl from the 80s does. I powered down the pastrami sandwich and then I took a power nap. Be prepared for a 15-20 minute wait in line and a 15-20 minute wait for "fast" food at The Slaw Dogs. You may assume that you can get a realistic glimpse into my eating habits by reading this blog. You would be wrong. Or half wrong. Or maybe half right. Take the last nine scrumptious days. I've slurped Japanese udon and soba at Sanuki No Sato ; indulged in a friend's home-made cassoulet , ala The Art of French Cooking; sampled more than a half dozen "red wines under $10" at the same friend's home; toasted to good health with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot; shared paella, charcutterie, Spanish potatoes and a bottle of Spanish wine with friends at Three Drunken Goats ; met friends for dinner at Malbec , where my medium rare steak arrived well done (but the staff did an excellent job of correcting the overcook); had a tasteless burger at The Counter in Pasadena; sipped a Manhattan at the decades-old bar at Musso and Frank ; tried the jellied consomme (like gelatin with a bouillon cube), beef tongue, mixed salad and Welsh Rarebit at Musso's ; and couldn't get enough of the fusilli with fresh tomatoes (hangers on from the garden), shallots, garlic, olive oil, splash of balsamic and sea salt I made for dinner on Saturday night. And, even though this rundown sounds like a foodie's fantasy, it's far from my typical week of dining and drinking. And it omits a lot of indulgences, like the half sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies that I gobbled down in the car on the way back from the Scout's home. Or the Cherry Garcia ice cream that I had to have after a friend blogged about the joys of the cherry and chocolate confection . All but one of these meals was blog-worthy, but I'm not tempted to write about a single one of these dining adventures. And why not? Because I want to talk about hot dogs. The Slaw Dogs kicks the classic hot dog up a notch. Specifically, the dogs with attitude at Pasadena's newest specialty restaurant, The Slaw Dogs on North Lake Avenue. The hotdoggery has been open since February, and already lines are snaking out the door, an unusual sight in the City of Roses (especially north of the 210). Today, I chatted with two women who had driven all the way from Camarillo and Torrance to sample the dogs. While other eateries are tumbling faster than dominoes, what is there about The Slaw Dogs that's packing in the crowds from all over Southern California? It's an All-American classic. I know the saying is, "As American as Apple Pie," but we could just as easily substitute "hot dog" for "apple pie." Can you think of a hot dog without visions of family barbecues, fourth of July cookouts, greasy diners and baseball games. It's nostalgia wrapped in a bun. It's a Regional Favorite: Seems like every state puts a different twist on the classic. There's the Chicago-style hotdog. The Coney Island dominates the Northeast. And, of course, the restaurant's namesake, the slaw dog, is a West Virginia classic. The bloggers at West Virginia Hot Dog point out that nobody in West Virginia orders a "slaw dog" because it's a given that your hot dog will come with slaw. (Well, it's a given if you live in one of the southern counties in the state. West Virginians take "regional food" to a whole new level.) The Slaw Dog gives you the chance to order your dog just the way you like it, whether you're from Brooklyn, New York, or Charleston, West Virginia. It Was Ready for a Makeover: Like the humble grilled cheese sandwich, macaroni and cheese and hamburger, the hot dog was ready to benefit from all the best ingredients, including a selection of 11 links offered at The Slaw Dogs. It's Fun to Have Choices: In addition to the choice in links, The Slaw Dogs offers 25 "standard toppings" and 22 "custom toppings." It Lends Itself to Fusion: The Slaw Dogs offers a Thai Slaw Dog with chicken sausage, spicy peanut-cocunut satay dressing, cilantro-carrot slaw, crushed peanuts and siracha aioli. The Green Monster, which appears to be one of the most popular dogs offered, is topped with roasted green chilli (that runs the length of the dog), chipotle mayo, grilled onion, pepperjack, and spicy garlic salsa. For my first visit, I went with "The Original" with chilli, cheese, mustard, onions and cole slaw (but I asked them to hold the cheese). It came served with a knife and fork, but that's almost as much fun as slicing up your pizza before you eat it. Unfortunately, my grilled hot dog bun became unhinged after two bites, but that didn't stop me from using my hands to polish off the classic. Left: "The Original" slaw dog Right: The Green Monster, a crowd favorite How did it compare with the slaw dogs I've devoured in my home state? Unlike the fine shredded cabbage in West Virginia, the slaw is coarse shredded at The Slaw Dogs. And the WV buns are soft and steamy, not dry from the grill. On the other hand, the chilli and the grilled hot dog were superior at The Slaw Dogs. Country roads, take me home to the place I belong, Pasadena. But, next time, can ya' steam the bun?

Whenever: Help save the Adams Park Station General Store at Chantry Flats. Read Cafe Pasadena's post about how to give to the non-profit associated with the historic general store. Hope to see you! I know. I know. Food guru Michael Pollan would not approve of eating ramen with a little packet of dried seasoning listing no fewer than 14 ingredients (including MSG). Just the same, legions of college students have escaped starvation and financial ruin by subsisting on the eight for a buck packages of Maruchan or Nissin Top Ramen noodles. My own finicky daughter started school with a hot meal in her belly, thanks to the Cup Noodles that she slurped every morning in the car for an entire year. (That, no doubt, qualifies me for the parenting hall of shame.) But me? The one with the discriminating taste buds? The one with the refined palate? No, I wouldn't stoop to slurping the ramen of starving students or the grab-it-and-go breakfast bunch. Thanks to the influence of my Japanese American neighbor, Carol, I suck down Myojo Chukazanmai ramen. At $1.49 a package, Myojo is the gourmet version of instant ramen. Last Saturday, I pondered the flavor choices on a pilgrimage to Mitsuwa Market in Torrance. I dropped a few packages of soy sauce and soy bean paste flavored ramen packages into my cart. And then came the WTF moment: Oriental flavor ramen. Why would a Japanese company with a Japanese audience market a vague "Oriental" flavor? To avoid confusion with the milder "Occidental" flavor? To evoke memories of a favorite Oriental rug? To appeal to foodies looking for a touch of the exotic? According to this review by NoodleSon, it's the sesame oil and traces of Chinese cabbage that contribute that taste of the Orient. Whatever you call it, instant ramen can be a bowl of comfort on a cold, wet day. But I'll bet that Michael Pollan still wouldn't call it food. I have a friend who truly exemplifies the word "gracious." When I recently threw a small birthday luncheon for her, she gushed repeatedly, "I can't believe all of the effort you made." Of course, she's the type who would be appreciative if I ordered Domino's pizza and mixed up a pitcher of instant tea. "I didn't go to that much effort," I protested, and I wasn't being modest. Here's proof that you can host a lazy luncheon and still make your guests feel pampered. Lazy Appetizer: The pesto torta , which we enjoyed al fresco with a couple bottles of bubbly, is pretty enough to look like you labored, but easy enough to assemble in less than five minutes. If you're feeling too lazy to slice your own baguette, have the bakery department at Von's Market do it for you. Lazy Table Setting: Use what you have. In my case, that meant backyard citrus for the center pieces and personalized grapefruit as the place setting. The gold napkins, purchased from Motif in Pasadena, pulled the look together. Not a Lazy Salad: This Winter Delight Salad is not exactly lazy, but the combination of slightly bitter arugula, sweet sliced pears, sour Granny Smith apples, sweet and salty candied pecans and pungent blue cheese is worth the effort. Lazier Option: Save time slicing fruit and candying pecans. Toss the greens with dried cranberries, slivered almonds and feta cheese. Still beautiful and delicious at a fraction of the effort. But, no matter how lazy you're feeling, please don't use a bottled dressing. Take two minutes and shake up your own balsamic vinaigrette - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Lazy Entree: It doesn't get easier or more delicious than this. I called Euro Pane and ordered their vegetarian quiche with a potato crust. They even sliced the pie for me and threw in a half dozen crusty currant rolls. Lazier Option : Ask one of your guests to pick up the quiche for you. Lazy Dessert: Add some bling to your table with shimmering oranges and pomegranate seeds. Make it special with a splash of Galliano liquor. Lazier Option: While you're at Euro Pane , pick up some of Sumie's famous lemon bars. So, go ahead and take the kudos for a lovely luncheon. Only you and I know how easy (and lazy) it really was. I first sank my teeth into one of Brent's Deli's Reuben sandwiches about ten years ago. I loved it, but I never went back. After all, Brent's is on the other side of the universe in Northridge . (I think I regard the San Fernando Valley in the same way that many Westsiders view the San Gabriel Valley: a long way to drive for a non-destination.) And I figured that crowded and popular delis like Brent's would be around forever. In spite of my Reuben infatuation, I was in no hurry to return. But that was before my "restaurants might kick the bucket before we do" epiphany. So when my deli-loving friend suggested Brent's as a "half-way" location for a lunch meeting, I bit. I circled around the mini-mall parking lot five times before snagging a space. At 11:30 am, Brent's was already crowded. The bustling deli was filled with families: elderly mothers breaking rye bread with middle-aged sons; grandmothers, mothers and toddlers sharing a table and chocolate cake; doting dads spoon feeding cabbage soup to adoring daughters. Brent's, like a treasured family brisket recipe, is passed from generation to generation. And as I once again sunk my teeth into the Black Pastrami Reuben Sandwich, I could see why. The thick layers of succulent pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing between grilled rye live up to the menu's promise: the sandwich melts in your mouth. I don't think I'll wait another ten years to return. Brent's Delicatessan and Restaurant 19565 Parthenia St. Northridge CA 91324 818.886.5679 Open daily 6am to 9pm Photo from http://oldschoolla.com Do you have a bucket list? A roster of things that you want to accomplish before you kick the bucket? If you're like me, food plays a big part on the ol' bucket list. There's just one problem with including restaurants on your list of things to do before you die: the restaurant might kick the bucket before you do. Just this week, two Los Angeles resaurant icons bit the dust. I've been to one, Goody's in San Gabriel, perhaps hundreds of times over the last 20 years. I always talked about but never made it to the second, Papadakis Taverna, the Greek restaurant in San Pedro. For years, Goody's was the location for my weekend Breakfast Club with a good friend. The waitresses weren't exactly mean, but they had no patience for special requests. (Half caf, half decaf coffee? Go to Starbuck's, Sweetie.) Well, maybe they were a little mean, but that was part of the charm. My friend Carol and I assumed that we would be eating pancakes and eggs at Goody's forever, or at least until we were as old as the other shriveled little old ladies who frequented the place. But, alas, Goody's served their last cup of bitter coffee last week. There's talk of a new location in El Monte, but it won't be the same without the f
miliar Googie architecture and crusty waitresses. Papadakis, the Greek restaurant that was as well known for its raucous dancing and breaking plates as its food, will serve its last meal and shatter its last plate on Sunday, February 1. Friends and I always talked about dancing and eating at Papadakis, but we never made it. Now I'm feeling a sense of urgency. What's on my food bucket list? This spring I plan to attend the annual Ramp Festival in Richwood, West Virginia, a daylong celebration of the pungent wild onion that is now a staple at high-end restaurants. How about you? Remember, we won't live forever and neither will even the most iconic restaurants. (For a list of 100 foods to try before you die, check out this just-published, SF-centric list from 7x7 SF. Scroll down for a look at Roadside Diner's pulled pork sandwich. I don't think I can live without this sandwich.) I was 21 when I made the decision to move from South Carolina to Southern California. Granted, it was a teaching contract that lured me out to the Golden State (and a snotty promise to my parents that I would move as far away from home as possible when I finished college). But I have to admit that I had been seduced by watching one too many episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies: swimming pools, movie stars. Throw in the beach and Disneyland, and I was hooked. More than two decades later, I'm now a little jaded at the sight of movie stars. Mickey and Minnie Mouse no longer do it for me. But there's one thing that reminds me that I'm living the golden life in the Golden State: citrus. And if citrus was gold, I'd be a wealthy lady. Our backyard trees are heavy with oranges, grapefruits, Meyer lemons and pomellos. I still can't get over the thrill of going to the back yard to pluck oranges for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. It took 12 oranges to make about 24 ounces of juice. Our grapefruit are a little sour, so I topped one with brown sugar and threw it under the broiler for 10 minutes. Get 'em while they're hot! Just let it cool before digging in. Nothing goes to waste. I use part of the peel to make orange zest and the remainder will go to our neighborhood goats. I'm making a Harvey Wallbanger cake with the rest of the fresh OJ and the orange zest. Of course, that means that I'll get to sip a Wallbanger cocktail while the bundt is in the oven (and before and after). Cheers to the good life in Southern California!
Mike has seen a steady uphill trend in overall speeds over the course of the last several days.  Conditions have been getting cold, and I have not seen any high winds or evidence of big storms.  The Iditarod dogsled race and associated snow machine traffic might be helping as well.The upshot of all this is that he's caught up to his 2008 pace, which is most definitely a good thing considering how tight his food and fuel margins are.Here is little SPOT replay video I put together showing comparing 2008 and 2010.  You can see how much slower things were in the beginning, and even though 2008 stays in McGrath for some time, it isn't enough to catch up.  The "Endless Innoko" stretch of 2008 is where Mike really started gaining ground, whether from better conditions or avoiding the mental fog / demoralization that plagued him that year.  He then continues to gain or hold ground throughout the Yukon river stretch.Reviewing some of Mike's older posts, I came across this post talking about the dangers of the 'sledneck' traffic and how he has festooned his bike all sorts of reflective tape and fabric.  In 2008 he recounts some interesting encounters with locals on snow machines, mostly out watching the dogsled race come by.  One person he met even claimed to have run over and killed an entire pack of wolves.  His post is well worth reading and can be found here.He ends the post,The night passes as a series of brief, anxious 'sleep' episodes, each abruptly ended by the imagined scream
I am listening as I type to my favorite CD. It is Susan Boyle’s singing like an angel. I love her voice and her choice of songs is varied and done well. When I first heard her on U Tube, I cried for her success and for the beauty of her rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream”. And the reaction of the judges and the audience thrilled me. I’ll bet I played that spot from U Tube over 100 times.Not only do I love the story of her success, but the fact that here was this gal staying at home taking care of her mother all of her life and the emerging like a butterfly from its chrysalis to becoming the most beautiful songstress of all. You go, gal. And she has went!!!! I know my grammar!I recently read several books. I have read Julie and Julia by Julie Powell and seen the movie. Any resemblance of one to the other is purely coincidental. The movie was all about Julia Childs and the book had very little about her and was about the life of the writer. I do not recommend it.I have also read again for the umpteenth time The Day before Winter which is about the Bennett families who live on this island near Nova Scotia and are lobster fishermen. I love these books for Elizabeth Ogilvie has written about the same families in a trilogy and then about other citizens of the island in other books but I feel as if I have lived there and that I know all of them personally. And I am a fisherman and I love the water.
Pridddddddy! Abc I know I could of had the easier obvious options, Isle of Man, island, Irish Sea but now I have the laptop back a chance to plunder( Viking style of course) the older images. One Harley Davidson being admired by locals and tourists on "Ramsey Day" ( yes we do have our own special day) when the TT Road Races take a a break. I am leaving this post tonight short and sweet, and just leave you to enjoy the image. I know I do. Reminds me soon the motorbikes are back, and so will some of you who will see this image tonight. I did wonder who owned it. I mean take a look at that number plate. Could this belong to an American tourist who liked certain TV show from the '70s or one of our more hazardous Ramsey residents? Leave you to ponder that one. For more abc's see here Reality check Anyone who knows me knows I have a thing about Henri Cartier Bresson. Well he was French( I am a Francophile too) and his photography is most definitely the single biggest inspiration of mine. Even before I knew the images I actually wanted to captured reflected his way of seeing the world. Considered the Godfather of modern street photography and photo journalism that is he captured the image as it was. No cropping, no desaturation, no tweaking in Photoshop. If it was blurry so be it. If someone wasn't quite in the best posed position does it really matter? In the real world, people are sitting around waiting for you to capture their image airbrushed, the sunset doesn't always looks beautiful and slush from that beautiful snowfall can make an equally interesting real image. Does every image have to be perfect, beautiful, geometrically balanced. The world is slightly askew, shoot it that way. You can always hold the camera at at different angle to capture the relatively dull scene to add your own creative twist. As he said he trapped life. Each image, especially the people I capture, traps that specific moment in time. The lone walker in the scene, unawares, whoever they were, braving what I can tell you now was a bitterly cold day midweek trapped through the lens. A moment never to be repeated. The pretty colours of Parliament Street reflected in the slush pools, the grim reality that when snow melts it's really quite miserable and horrible captured as it was. The way Bresson did....... ......Of course we all know that I am also barking mad. Throw in that element of quirkiness then all the above goes out the window and I can show you my very none Bresson images. Pics when I have specifically coaxed people to play the fool for the camera, or purposely shot the same inanimate object from quirky angles, waiting for sunlight to hit the bridge, because it seemed like a good idea at the time. 100 times, that being the abridged version of a very long story! For more My World posts, Click here after 8pm. Praise be to Eric Tenin 5 th Year celebration of Paris Daily Photo Many of us over the years have probably had what we thought was a unique brainwave, a daily photo of the place we live. Sorry folks, myself included, and I am a brainwave kind of a lass, Eric had the conception, is the Godfather of the original Daily Photo. What better city too in my absolute favourite country in the whole wide world but a Daily Photo of Paris, France. Today we in the City Daily Photo community are honouring the founder in his trademark style " from the ground up" genre of image with one taken from where we reside. From the rank amateur to the more accomplished professional all are welcome in the community, from one horse town to the biggest cities in the world and it is Eric we have to thank for bringing us all together under the umbrella of a website community to show our place to the world. Congratulations Eric, and long may you reign so long as you understand I am still Queen B of my island. Click here to view thumbnails for all participants . Highlights on the high seas I'm beginning to feel like Ross from Friends talking to Rachael. I never deserted the blog. I WAS ON A BREAK. Can I please add not by choice. My psycho laptop, the one with suicidal tendencies had a breakdown and fell into a coma. The nut job laptop is back, motherboard images intact and whatever therapy it needed to cope with me constantly abusing it by uploading soooooooooooooooooo many images we have reached an understanding. So here's the first one to get us back into the groove before I go off at a complete tangent as usual and into a mega rant about island life not being all it should be. A sweet little finish the day off after the rugby on the way home shot of the harbour. Gotta say, it's been all doom and gloom weather wise, but just as the laptop arrived home the glorious light returned to our shores and the wonderful sky blue appeared on the high( ok harbour inlet but let me manipulate the truth as always for purple prose effect and slip in another H) just waiting for me to capture. The vessel moored too nicely weathered and hell I've even got people in there walking to the lighthouse, just to prove I ain't the only one residing here. Just the only one in hiding. Those privy to my FB real persona can vouch for the fact I actually do have a cunning highway woman outfit. Another h, though on reflection not perhaps the most inconspicuous of outfits to wear taking photos. Well I'm hopefully back, but I'm not a slave to the blog and this is not a to be taken too seriously look at the world I live in. Photography yes, words no. This isn't a travelogue but you will learn more about true island life and quirks than any book/site/or I love the island so much I won't have a word said against it types. It's a love hate relationship after all. For more abc's see here Or three's a crowd Well of course I could have gone for the obvious title of Swan Lake, but that would have been a bit of a lie. I'm not averse to bending the truth, well blatantly lying on this blog to illustrate an image with the text when I'm bored, or feeling mischievous but today, play it straight. The three little swan gliding into view are the real part not stuffed but the water is the swizz. It's not the lake but the Harbour inlet. If you look closely at the top half of the image you can see darker contrasting lines reflecting upon the lighter coloured water of the sail masts of the moored boats. Swans always look beautiful to photograph, but don't get two close. For such elegant creatures they have a nasty hiss and can break your arm if they don't want their photo taken. One for the zoom lens and run. Still on a borrowed laptop, so posts as and when. For other My World images, click here . Why photograph anything else Still laptop less at the moment and without access to my older images which the defunct (possibly but it's certainly comatosed) suicidal laptop is holding to ransom I have dipped yet again into the recent archives. Slowly we are going to walk along the whole of this river walk each Skywatch unless I get out there with camera and offer you something new. Why bother. I can dine out on these tranquil reflections for the rest of the year. After all we all know I'm the world's laziest photographer, so anything that makes life easier. Had to take my own image from another site I have stashed images away for when laptops throw themselves off tall building when they have had enough, so not the best size and little small, but you get the general idea. Short and sweet tonight, bit of a rush job. For for more Skywatch images click here . Reflections on a Skywatch Theme Apologies to any Sci Fi fans who searched Serenity and were hoping to catch a glimpse of the cast of Firefly ( yes I am TV, film buff, uber geek in addition to the music buff bit too) but his particular image above is my own personal slice of serenity. Not your most up to date image, another of those snowy image shots I rattled off within a couple of hours in one day, knowing the next this scene would disappear, probably for another 7 years until we have any kind of snowfall worth mentioning. I did warn you the icy/ snow photos would run linger for a while but I do try and vary them. Blatant lie there. It's the same Sulby river walk as last week, further along the path with a touch of melting ice in the foreground and the stillest of reflections. You'll note reflections play a big part of the blog. Easiest shot in the world on a clear crisp Winter's day with no breeze and they are always a pretty spectacular shot even in a mere novices hand with a simple (no this is the big Nikon) point and shoot. In other words, if in doubt shoot over water. It doubles the amount of available light by bouncing it around and the flatter it is the deeper the depth of the reflection. Short and sweet tonight and I won't be around. Babooshka does not exist but the photographer does and I will be out celebrating my Birthday for the next 3 days. Yes I know it is tomorrow, Friday, but somewhere around the world over the next three day it is Jan 29th. That's my excuse an I'm sticking to it. For more Skywatch images please click here Dontcha wish your snowman was hot like mine B If you are on B's Facebook you will know I'm less B for bewitched and more for bothered and bewildered by the whole island failure to connect properly with the outside world.the last 24 hrs. Maddening. So you get a last minute substitute image as I've being haranguing Facebook all day to no avail about getting the Isle of Man a proper, stand alone server. We are an island, a country apart. Ramsey is not in Manchester, UK. In fact none of the island is. Don't get me started on that one, or I will tell you why we should not be paying for a TV license either! Rant over. The snowman. Not sure if it's a snowman or snow woman. Play safe and shall we say flamboyant? Whatever he/she/it is I'm going with Lola ( you should know my musical references by now) and say that is just the coolest outfit you see on a snow person, of which I can take no credit for dressing, and that outfit surely is a "bold statement." Ambiguous B, yes but Bowring Road would be such a boring obvious B, and I have shown you the Britannia pub before. There is a bonus B in there if you look very closely. Babooshka. As I don't really exist though, only for blog purposes, maybe that reflection of the photographer is in your head. For other ABC' liteteral, lateral or otherwise see here .
Outside, the weather was sunny and a bit chilly. Inside, a sumptuous salad was waiting. My darling Gym treated us to a very cool and delicious lunch yesterday. Our new friend Martin prepared it all and I'm sorry my batteries went kaputt when the homemade smoked salmon made its apparition on the table. I wish I could tell you the recipe, but I'm afraid some details escaped me ! But I can tell you, it was absolutely delicious. We had cheap Spanish cava (the equivalent of champagne) but like we say in France, when the company is merry, champagne is always good even if its cheap. While waiting for the food to be ready, we nibbled on little goat cheese and walnut canapés under Frieda's benevolent eye. I think sunday lunches with friends are the best. We always part, making the promise that we must do it at least once a month and luckily we almost never fail. It also gives another color to mondays ! My lovelies, I didn't mean to stay away from you for so long but as you might have guessed, life took over and work kept me busy these last few days. I thought I would share my big news with you. Do you remember, I told you last summer some people approached me and ask if I could plan their wedding in Andalusia ? Well at that time, I wasn't too sure and declined the offer. But then the idea of being a wedding planner in the region I fell in love with, became really attractive to me, although it can be quite a daunting task. I started another blog Un mariage au soleil (a wedding in the sun) - which some of you already know - while still working on the website. With the precious help of Monchéri, I gathered zillions information about suppliers, religious ceremonies, musicians and what not in our area. Having already worked for wedding planners in Paris as a designer, I knew more or less what the job implied. But I still spent numerous hours on Internet reading blogs of American wedding planners which honestly are the best to me and learning from them. And then, it happened. Before Christmas, I received an email from a French couple saying they want to get married in Granada. We exchanged regular emails and they flew over from Paris last week and we met. My first professional appointment as a wedding planner ! As you can imagine, I was impossibly nervous. I assailed myself with questions : am I wearing the right clothes ? do I know enough, what if I can't answer a question ? and so on...The day before their arrival, I left a little welcome package at their hotel and on d-day I picked up the couple at their hotel and we went for lunch in one of the most typical restaurants in Granada. The days after, we went visiting venues. They were absolutely charming and now with a big smile I can tell you that it went really well (meaning I think they will trust me to be their wedding planner). It is a bit early to say anything yet because the wedding will be in 2011 but it looks definitely promising. I wanted to share this news with you because in a way I owe it to you. It suddenly dawned on me that in my moments of lack of confidence, before meeting my clients, I remembered some of the lovely and sincerely encouraging comments you wrote on the first post of my wedding blog. It was just a very quick flash or rather something like a misty cloud of love. You, my lovely blogging friends sent me these warm and precious waves of love and support. In those moments of doubt, your encouraging words were suspended in the air like little bubbles of love. For this, I want to thank you and I want to hug you all in my arms !! I especially want to thank my faithful blogging friends who always make me smile and always inspire me : Mélanie , Catherine , Melissa , Linda , Cherry Blossom Girl , Joyful , Susanna , Christina , Judith , Michael , David , Agneta , Vicki , Sarah , Elizabeth , Constance , Nathalie , Relyn , Se'lah , Lynne , Yoli , Cynthia , Gillian , Dutchbaby , Caroline , Maria Cecilia , Ry , Linda at lime in the coconut , Des . I also take this opportunity to welcome my new followers. Thank you for being part of My Castle in Spain ! I wish you all a wonderful week end ! The Gourmet shop of El Corte Inglès in Granada is always filled with little temptations for me. I find this crisps packaging delightfully girly. Now I can match my crisps bag with my lilac handbag and necklace. That's what I call eating crisps in style.... San Nicasio is a Spanish company specialized in snacks and established in the province of Cordoba. Its manager Rafael del Rosal won two consecutive gold medals in the Brussels World Selection of Quality in 2008 and 2009. Not only these crisps are made with Spanish non-transgenic potatoes but they are also fried in one of the best Andalusian olive oils (with the Priego de Cordoba's guarantee of origin and quality) and are salted with Himalayan pink salt. And last but not least, a slow frying method is used at a low temperature to prevent the formation of undesirable substances. Cool crisps, I tell you ! Have a wonderful week end ! Tailors are rare nowadays, except may be on Savile Row in London. A decade ago, sastres (tailors) could still be found in Granada and sadly there are only two left today. Every time, I pass by their shop, I so want to push the door and ask them if they would let me take some pictures of their workshop and talk about their trade. In the meantime, let me introduce you to Martin the tailor, whom we met last saturday at my dear friend Gym's birthday dinner party. Martin is Dutch and lives on the coast in Salobreña where he established his workshop a little while ago. We had a very interesting conversation about bespoke tailoring and what it can mean to a person. Martin has a blog and here is what he says about his work in a post humorously titled Consummate professionalism or professional idiot ? ..... No matter how much money you make, no matter how famous your clients may be, when you're in a line of work such as tailoring, inevitably people will tell you that the world has changed, and people no longer are willing to pay such amounts for a suit. Some are a bit less straightforward and ask how can one survive as an independent and slightly eccentric tailor: I wish I could tell them but I can't: All I know is that it works, there are actually people left on this planet, who value beauty and quality, and who are willing to pay for it .... (to read more go here ) Well...Monchéri is dreaming of a redingote and me of the suit and coat worn by Kim Novak in Vertigo...Hum....now the question is : dear Martin, can we pay you by installments ? pic from Martin's blog This is the place I would like to live in, at least a few months to fill my days with such inspiring beauty. Alas, the parador is not a cheap hotel but believe me, just one night would suffice for me. Last saturday, I could only take photos of the patios and the gardens, as I need to meet the manager of the hotel during the week so that he can show me the dining room and lounges. I'm sure it will be a wonderful venue for small celebrations. This former convent built in the XVth century is actually very romantic. It was a promise made by Catholic King Fernando and Queen Isabel to build a convent for the Franciscan order once they put an end to nearly seven centuries of Moorish domination in Spain in january 1492. The convent was built on the site of a former Nazari palace, with gardens and baths, surely the property of a Nazari prince. The Franciscans settled there in 1495 and a chapel was placed in what had been the center of the Moorish house. You can have a drink at the hotel's café and stroll in its splendid gardens facing the refreshing scenery of the Alhambra. Blissful isn't it ? Tomorrow, if it doesn't rain, I will hop again to the gardens of the Alhambra and take some pictures of the charming former XVth century convent which was built amidst the gardens. Today, it is the Parador de Granada , a luxury hotel which I would love to experience one day... Could you imagine what was life like in the Alhambra in bygone days ? Surely, one was inclined to be more courteous, romantic and flirtatious... Have a wonderful week end ! pic : lithography of Léon Auguste Asselineau Sala de las dos hermanas en el Alhambra (c.1830) Women in Granada like to dress pretty. I often pass by elegant women and feel too shy to stop them and ask if I can take a picture of them. This beautiful granadina had her back turned to me so I did a quick shot. I was fully concentrated on her woolen frilly dress, which I totally love and before I could think of something not too stupid to tell her, she was quickly rejoined by another young woman, with the same hair color, and dressed in similar style like her little sister...Cute... Some of my favorite words in Spanish are terraza al sol , a terrace under the sun. This is the best gift Granada has to offer on a lazy saturday morning. We were lucky enough to have one sunny day before the rain poured again on sunday. This is plaza Carlos Cano which comes alive when the sun is out. Wouldn't it be wonderful to organize a brunch party there ? The building on the side needs a bit refreshing . It seems obviously not in use, I wonder what will be done with it. I find its façade so romantic with the little orange trees and the wrought iron balconies.

Yes, yes, soon the fourway bonding attempt with begin. Harriet gets her staples out on Tuesday, her incision looks like it healed nicely as there was no redness or swelling and she was a good girl and didn't lick it. She has seemed a bit depressed, probably a result of the surgery and no being let out of her pen. Harriet in her willow tent and all matching floor towels. I tried putting the Snoozy pad in the tent but it was pushed out. Once arranged near the food bowls she often stretches out on it. Harriet has some definite ideas about BunShui. Her appetite has not been as sharp as her pre-surgery self (or as the other rabbits who seem to think they are being starved). However in the last day or so appetite is seeming better and she was skittering around her pen and working hard at pulling a towel through the bars. There were two meetings without bars, one inadvertent and one planned, between Amelia and Harriet. The first was when, in an attempt to let Harriet have more room I barricaded off half the back room. Amelia was engaged with a nap in her lean-to. Harriet was quite stimulated by the whole arrangement and within a few minutes had broken down the barricade and was nose to nose with Amelia, who did absolutely nothing. This seemed like a good sign so later I opened the outside annex (AKA the Bunnex ) and let Amelia out. She immediately found the pumpkin I'd put out because it was molding on one side and began to help herself, not to the moldy part which was really very small. I let Harriet out for some room exploration, but she was more interested in finding Amelia. Play the video to see what happened. This event happened twice, each time ending in a light scuffle. Now I have an idea of what to expect. If I can bond all four rabbits I think it will be a pretty busy place here at the Rabboratory. Just this morning all the rabbits were in the back room. Harriet was tossing her dish around, Amelia was being groomed by Tyler and Sydney was in the small box house. Minutes later Harriet was messing with her fence and pulling a towel through it, Amelia was rolling the snack ball around and Tyler and Sydney were shacked up in the box house, which is very, very cosy for two rabbits. Tyler (L) and Sydney (R), Spots got to stick together, mostly...... Tyler thinks that if we are going to have ANOTHER free range bun about the house that the door needs to be just a wee bit bigger..... Have a great week everybun........ Tyler considers our new art photo...... It has a been a rather busy week both in and out of BlogLandia. First we WON the signed calendar page from Alice at Potentially Nervous / Crazy . The page was so GORGEOUS, I had to frame it. For some reason 17 x 11 is not a frame size where I live unless you do a custom frame and buy the glass separately and such and such. However after more thought than seemed necessary, I realized if I bought the 16 x 12 frame I'd only have to trim an inch from the length and I could fill in the gap at the bottom with the Angora fur that Alice so kindly sent along in the package. It looks pretty good! it's fun to have some new art. I am going to hang it low so the rabbits can continue to admire it and commune with the image of their friend, FATS. Amelia, especially, considers him her special friend..... Amelia thinks about Fats and wonders what a Winter Wonderland would be like.... Harriet got spayed last Tuesday, it was a little scary when the vet said she was having trouble waking up and that sometimes happened. She was slow to eat and pee and poop and I had to give her a couple of doses of Medicam. She seems to have fully recovered judging for appetite poops and boxing matches with the other rabbits through the fencing and gets her staples removed on Friday or next Monday Bunday. Then we shall see about the bonding...... H arriet watched her favorite Potentially Crazy screen saver as part of her recovery therapy. And then we got an award from Crafty Green Poet : the Kreativ Blogger Award. In order to accept this accolade I have to list 7 (!) things about myself that you don't know and list SEVEN fellow bloggers to pass this on to...... 7 Things you DON'T know ABOUT me, but soon you will..... 1. I was born in New Jersey, but only stayed for two months. 2. I was once mistaken for a dog. 3. In High School I received a special art award for creating the most Rhinoceroses as prints, drawings and ceramic pieces. 4. I dropped out and returned to college 4 times. 5. Sydney does not like bananas. 6. I don't like coconut anything. 7. In a small notebook I kept throughout the 7th grade I wrote that I wanted to write and illustrate stories and train horses when I grew up..... To carry on this award, it was very hard to pick, I choose the following Kreativ bloggers: 1- BunnyGirl because she is a writer too. 2- RoadBunner because she takes great pics of Mario and knitted a rabbit. 3- Silver and/or Ankles because she is also a fabric/batik artist. 4- Friend of Animals because she makes really charming handmade cards. 5- Pensacola Paula because of her excellent photos. 6- Fez and the Gang because of funny caring posts and some super pics. 7- Raspberry Rabbits because she just is very creative, no matter how you spell it. I apologize if anyone mentioned already got this award, these things tend to travel round and round repeating their appearances........ A break in the weather allows for Harriet to go out into the garden and Amelia to go out onto her deck, which has been enlarged by a few more fencing panels. We realize that some of our friends are in snow storms and what passes for a storm on the central California Coast would constitute a break for them, we do realize that........ Amelia wonders what Harriet has found to do on the other side of the fence. Investigation reveals a major project underway. Harriet asks what how we li ke her earthwork. Epilogue: the bench under which Harriet chose to place her art project was moved and the hole filled in. It was explained to Harriet that this was for her own safety because the tunnel construction was unstable and could collapse. She took this in stride and stretched out luxuriously in the soft damp earth. Later she had to get her white mittens washed..... Amelia is quite, quite, quite fond of being petted. If Tyler is getting his pets she will dash over and insert her head as close to his as she can. In this little movie you can see what is a usual occurrence around here. This short also features Sydney jumping over her brother! Since Harriet is in a pen I try to let her out into the garden everyday for awhile if weather permits. She is pretty good about coming in and hasn't tried to get away. But don't think I'm not constantly checking on her. She has started a digging project that may have to be curtailed before she gets under the deck. Her paws got so muddy from her last last work detail that I had to wash and dry them, much to her dismay. In the next short she is checking our our fallow garden beds where I dump the rabbits poops. Don't miss the very end part where she flicks her butt and sprays urine! Harriet is wondering when she will get out of jail. In true Harriet fashion her spay date has been changed three times. The good news is we have a certificate to pay for more than half AND our favorite vet, Dr. H., with whom we have a long relationship, will do the surgery. She is so good with the anesthesia and makes very small low incisions, so we hope for a quick recovery. Additionally Dr. H. wants a rabbit print as payment for Harriet's exam, OK, I think I can manage that.... And when Harriet has recovered we can try some four way bonding. Harriet shadows the spotted Syd. Nobody has called about Harriet. It seems that she is, if we can integrate her, one of the gang here at the Rabboratory. She'll go in for her spay next week and then after an as yet undetermined recovery time, I'll try to bond the four of them....I'm thinking I should try introducing them, without fencing, one at a time; preferably in a neutral spot like the bathtub or a pen outside. Tyler and Harriet lounge while Amelia shows concern for the difficulties of photographing a very dark rabbit. Since she has been here Harriet has been in a pen where everybun can see her and interact with her through the bars. There has been a little boxing and and the only time there was much upset was when she was in the kitchen and Tyler was in the Rabboratory; everything was wrong and they each blamed the other. There has been lots and lots of pooping and peeing on both sides of the fence. When she first arrived it had seemed like Harriet would be the queen of box habits, but now that she feels she needs to demarcate her space, she's got both barrels blazing and the other rabbits aren't much better. Harriet on a bun-errand..... Often all rabbits are quite relaxed and I have them close while eating. There has been flopping on both sides, a good sign! Harriet gets to go out in the yard with supervision. Here she seems to have a set pattern of places she needs to go and things to chin, so far she has not deviated from it. When I need to get her in I herd her into the kitchen and pick her up there, she'd rather not be picked up outside, it's humiliating. Amelia loves to go out on the deck and thinks she ought to be allowed into the garden too.... Have a good week! Harriet can be a bit of the trickster, she is so dark that sometimes I can't see her in her pen and I am sure she was done a Houdini. She is able to scramble over the three foot Xpen, so I have to pin a sheet over the top. There were some exciting night time escapes and forays into the living room, stronghold of the Spots, before this technological innovation was in place. Hopping when she can. Today there were some mix-ups involving Harriet. When I brought her to the vet last week Dr. H . was concerned, and rightly so, about performing a spay on a rabbit that might be someone else's. She asked that Harriet be registered as found with County Animal Control for a waiting period of two weeks. I dutifully did this the very same day. On Friday Dr. H's office called and left a message asking to schedule her spay. So today I called and spoke with C. and told her the story. When C. relayed the story to Dr. H. she left out enough for Dr. H. to think I'd surrendered Harriet to Animal Control. "Diana would never, never do that!" she said and had B. call me back for clarification; A little mix-up; we were all relieved to find I wasn't behaving out of character. Harriet chooses a book to take back to her pen. Because Harriet is in a pen I try to bring her out often to stretch her legs. The kitchen has a good straight run in it and I've rabbit proofed the back yard enough that with supervision she can go out there. Today it was a particularly fine morning so I took Harriet out in the yard while I pruned a rose tree. I followed her around a while and saw she was going to all the places she went the day before. Everything seemed quite stable, I kept my eye on her. I turned my back to do something or other and she was gone. Vanished into thin air. I looked everywhere. I could just imagine what the BF would say because I had been saying I thought she wasn't going to make a break for it and would stick around. Thinking she might have breached the side barrier and gone out front I went into the kitchen on my way through the house. Who comes racing out of the back room with Amelia on her tail, yes, it was the run away rabbit. Harriet had hopped up the steps and into the kitchen, which she knew well and returned to her room to "visit" with Amelia......... With a whole kitchen to explore the most interesting thing is still of the other side of the door . Tyler was complaining that he hasn't had adequate face time on the blog and that we finally had some light so couldn't I take some pictures of him? After he saw them he thought he ought to go get a job as a male model, apparently he has forgotten how devastatingly handsome he is. Look me in the eye and deny me anything, I dare you! One of his many soft sides..... Which is my best side? That would be which ever one you are lucky enough to see. On another front it was reported to me last week that there was a loose rabbit around the neighborhood. Although I looked here and there, I decided to let karma have her way in this situation. On Saturday morning this rabbit hopped down the driveway and into the backyard. I had a little chat with her, she let me pet and pick her up. It was raining, so she got a towel dry and has been living in a fenced in bathroom. She says her name is Harriet, she a dark agouti, very soft, very tame. The other rabbits have been pretty emotional since her arrival with a lot of chasing and such like. Interestingly there is less of an interest in her than there was in Amelia and there is not so much marking (not yet at any rate). I'm not sure if I'm up for having FOUR rabbits, but for the time being I think I can take it; one bun at a time. She's a little darker than this photo shows and her fur is in really good condition, not patchy like it looks here. Guess a week of rainwater rinses does something.... Have a really interesting week. It has started to rain heavily, some reports say it may be like this for a week. The reports are always changing. Sydney tried to amuse Amelia by telling her a ghost story about a rabbit who got it's ears removed by aliens who took them to a quite distant planet in another galaxy beyond the moon for further study of the miraculous properties of rabbit ears. Then Amelia made up her own story........
My 13 year old son has bad phone karma. This year he has dropped his cell phone in the toilet...and in a storm drain. The most recent folly was the storm drain last weekend. His cell phone was in his pocket...and as he got into the car, it slipped out and fell onto the street and into the storm drain. The look on his face was tragic. Then the desperation kicked in.&nbsp; We attempted to retrieve the phone with a golf-ball grabber thingy, a rake, and we even considered holding my 8 yr old upside down and lowering him into the sewer... but, no phone was retrieved. The last act of desperation was a call to the City of McKinney the next morning. And lo and behold, the city send out...Storm Drain Sal. A petite man who slid into the storm drain man hole and saved the phone...which still worked, amazingly. Wonder what else he's saved out of our city sewers? My 13 yr old son plays in the middle school band. And we rent his trombone from a local music store, Music &amp; Arts . I realized this week I'd skipped a payment. Accidently. As I hurried to make the phone call in order to get caught up on payments...it occurred to me that there might be a musical mafia.&nbsp; I didn't want to have to get a loan from a shylock...or get iced. Maybe, if there is a musical mafia, they put the hit out on my son...they outsource...and use bullies from the local middle school to collect. I'd feel so guilty. We're paid up though. Donny can play his trombone safely.&nbsp; I know, sometimes I think too much. And follow too many rabbit trails.&nbsp; I'm weird like that. When I was younger, we read a book at school about a man who paints houses for a living but dreams of far away places.&nbsp; When he sees a movie about Antarctica, he is so fascinated that he writes to Admiral Drake, an explorer there. Instead of answering the letter, the Admiral sends a large wooden box with holes punched in the sides. When Mr. Popper removes the outer boards, out jumps a full grown penguin. From then on, his days are filled with one adventure after another. This book began my love affair with penguins . I had a stuffed penguin that I slept with for years, and I named him Captain Ork.&nbsp; (Ork being the sound a penguin makes) Tonight, watching the Olympics women's ice dancing short programs, I was reminded of one of my favorite animals once again. And by a little known fact I recently discovered about them. The King Penguins have an organ above their eyes that convert salt water to fresh water. So, they can drink salt water. How amazing is that?! All the answers we're looking for in science...are in the animal kingdom. Seriously.&nbsp; This kid is so cool. He has every NERF gun possible. He's smart and sweet. He's super athletic, but also loves video games. He's a little tightly wound at times, but he's my sweet Remy. Next up: Donny got his braces off! Woohoo!! My take on the Oylmpics Opening Ceremony : The most vivid image I was left with after Friday night was a guy flying over wheat fields and flannel-wearing, tattoo-covered, grunge fiddling tap dancers . Canada, you are strange, but in a friendly-dorky kind of way. I was kind of disappointed Celine Dion didn't end up naked in a maple syrup fountain. The indigenous dancers had to dance for an hour straight. Because we haven't done enough to them by taking their land and such. And slam poetry? Wow. That was unique!! Overall, it was a bizarre event, and really, really long. Canadians are either really deep...or really high . Not sure which. and all that money (30-40 Million!)&nbsp; spent on the opening ceremony could have gone to something more impressive...like helping Haiti or some other third-world country. That would have said a lot more, in my book. But, I love the Olympics ! And I love reading all the twitter commentary on it. I'm taking my Valentines to get haircuts...because I can no longer see their eyes. And then we're going to see a movie. Probably the new Percy Jackson movie Lightning Thief . Because my older son and I have read all the books and LOVE the series. What are your plans? They aren't sure where Mozart's body is buried. Polar Bears are left-handed. Butterflies taste with their feet. Cows have four stomachs. Horses cannot vomit. A crocodile cannot stick out its tongue. Most people cannot lick their elbow. Which of those statements astonishes you the most? An aptly named abandoned boat!! Actually, that's not my attitude at all. I always care. Perhaps too much. I care about the now homeless people in Haiti. I care about my family. I care about the people I work with and our clients . I care about what I want to do with my life and that it matters somehow. Caring makes things harder. and more challenging. But totally worthwhile.
i see a lot of eclipses in this painting by wassily kandinsky, although he called it several circles.i think it would be cool to have a first name like "wassily." his work reminds me of my grandmother's paintings.  i like the bold geometric forms and colors.he manages to express the romance of a circle.  i went to the lenbauchaus in munich, germany one time and was mesmerized by the shapes in this massive painting...... and the colors of this one.
I loved Juno. It left me feeling really happy, and that's all you can really ask from a movie, right? I thought it was loads better than Little Miss Sunshine, which it has oft-been compared to, and I actually thought, as unplanned pregnancy movies go, it was much better than Knocked Up (which I enjoyed). I don't want to say too much since this is still in limited release and a lot of people probably haven't seen it yet, but some stuff I really liked:-the music, I thought it was perfect. I rarely ever buy movie soundtracks and I want to get the soundtrack.-it was structured around a school year and there were little subtitles for spring, summer, fall, and winter. This worked really well in my opinion--when you're in high school, so much hinges around the changing of the seasons. -Michael Cera's character didn't have much to do, and his head-in-the-sand behavior regarding the pregnancy bugged me.-there was one scene, that I don't want to describe because it was a pivotal plot point (and one I didn't see coming), that was so emotionally awkward and visceral that it made me uncomfortable. In a good way.-I liked Ellen Page in Hard Candy and I like her even more now.-Yes, some of the slang was awkward and felt forced--particularly one line "honest to blog?" that made me cringe--but I think that died down as the movie went on.-Loved Alison Janney as the stepmom. Loved when the dad said "I'm gonna hit that Paulie Bleecker kid in the wiener"-There was a slag against ultrasound techs! My fiance, currently in school for medical imaging, was very defensive. Hah.-Jennifer Garner always seemed kinda blah to me in a Sandra Bullock way, but she was very good here.-Funny that Juno learned that babies have fingernails when they are born, cause I just learned that
Here's the link! http://www.nmnathletics.com/newMediaPlayer/console.htm?DB_OEM_ID=23020&amp;type=live&amp;oemid=23020&amp;id=44428 Day 1 was duet free and thematic we swam 7th and 8th Day 2 was free team we swam 3rd Day 3 was combo we swam 2nd Enjoy! Nous revenons tout juste du 3e World Trophy en Espagne à Madrid. La compétition avait lieu sur 3 jours soit du 5 au 7 décembre. Notre premier entraînement avait lieu le 2 décembre. Après une journée de voyagement, il n’est jamais facile de retourner dans l’eau. Cependant, notre première pratique a très bien été. Notre horaire était super chargé, nous avions un entraînement avec musique le matin, ensuite un retour à l’hôtel rapide pour dîner, et un autre entraînement dans l’après-midi. Au retour, nous faisions du vidéo afin de corriger le plus d’erreurs possibles pour le lendemain. La compétition a commencé avec l’épreuve de duo libre avec Marie-Pier et Chloé, elles ont très bien nagé! Une heure plus tard, c’était à Tracy et moi de compétitionner dans l’épreuve de duo thématique. Notre maillot avait des pantalons et un chapeau qui représentait la Diva de Salvador Dali. Tous les duos thématiques devaient absolument avoir une thématique espagnole et nous avions aussi droit à un accessoire. Nous passions dernière et nous avons donné notre meilleure performance jusqu’à maintenant. (Cela fait juste 2 mois que nous pratiquons ensemble.) Le lendemain, c’était l’équipe libre. Nous avons dû travailler beaucoup sur nos highlights et vu de cette compétition et ils ont tous fonctionnés! Nous nagions le même programme libre qu’aux Olympiques, mais avec plus de la moitié de nouvelles nageuses. Le dimanche c’était le combo. Le public a adoré notre routine! Nous sommes maintenant en congé pour quelques semaines! En janvier, nous effectuerons quelques changements dans les programmes afin de les préparer le mieux possible pour les Championnats du Monde de 2009, à Rome. After the Olympic Games, half of the team retire, which is totally normal! I'm still swimming and this year, I'm swimming team, combo and duet. The combo is a mix of 5 minutes of everyroutine. It's really visual! It's like a show. We are leaving for our first competition on Sunday. It's the World Trophee in Madrid, Spain. This competition is really different from the World Championships or the Olympics. There will be only 5 judges (there is 10 usually) and their marks will be only artistic. We are going to swim the same free team as at the Olympics, the combo is a brand new routine, the duet free is the same routine as the Olympic and the duet I'm swimming is a thematic duet. Every country has to swim on a spanish music for minutes and we are allow to have an acessory. I'll post some pictures later, I have to keep the secret for now! The duet competition is next Friday, the free team is on Saturday and the Combo is on Sunday. We had an amazing swim!!! We cam 4th!! Japan got a penalty from touching the bottom and we beat US!!!! We are really proud!! Closing today!!! I'm a little early on schedule so I've got a little bit of time to write... After a night of counting and reviewing my routine, we got up ate breakfast and did our hair, make up (which we had a class for Cirque du Soleil) and we put our hat on... The schedule today looks a lot like yesterday... And I might not have time to say how it goes before a day or 2.... But, here is the draw... US goes first, which is really good for us, then 2nd Australia, 3rd Egypt, 4th Canada, 5th China, 6th Japan, 7th Spain and 8th Russia. After our performance, we have a dinner at the Canada house with our friends and families. That's about it for now.... I can't wait to perform...!! And be done... hihi!!! Today was a really good day! Not even we finally tied with the US team, but we also got one of the best performance of our tech team program which was . It contains 11 different elements. We had a little music pratice this morning for 15 minutes and we shared with Japan. The practice went really well! Our coaches almost didn't know what to say after each part of our training! We also did a runthrough to make sure we were ready physically and mentally before we competed. After that, we had a little time to do make up, relax, watch video of our music practice and then we were getting ready for the big event!!! Imagine what goes in your mind while you're sitting there, an hour before you go... You think about thousands corrections that you have, and then you think of how many people are going to watch you on tv, that your family is in the stands for the BIG competition, you also think about how many hours, weeks, years that you work to be able to swim there...! It was almost 3.... then you put your cap and googles back on, and you get ready to do the last warm up before the competition. I did my laps of the routine with the I-pod that goes underwater with a teammate, then got out and walk to the call room. There, we had our focus group, where the captain says what to think about in certain places of the routine, and she told us that whenever we were feeling distracted because it was the Olympics Games, just count louder in your head!! Then, I took a few breath, a sip of water and the doors opened in front of us. It was OUR turn now! So we walked on... as cool as we could be and we did our routine, trying to convince everyone that we ROCK!! The swim felt really good! And the coaches were really happy at the end! We were swimming 3rd and US 8th... (they are our big competitor) So we went to watch them live... and when we saw that we were tied with them we were just so HAPPY!!! We had a few minutes after that to go see our families! So I ran up to them and talked to them for a little while...! That was really cool to have them with me at that moment! We had a short practice for the Free team around 4h30.... We were so excited to go back in the pool and just fight!! So we can be ahead of them and go up in the world ranking. We are now back in the Village and we can't wait to compete tomorrow!! I got up not a long time ago... I'm competing today! Finally, after all that training! It's tech team. I have a thousands things to think about. My hair are up already and half of my make up is done! We are swimming around 3 this afternoon! For the one that wants to watch it live go on ! http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/ Can't wait to swim!!! This morning I had the chance to enjoy our last sleep in before the competition started. I really took the time to rest. My family also had a chance to have special tickets to come and visit the Olympic Village. It was really cool to have them here! At lunch time, I got them Mc Donalds from the cafeteria, while I was eating my little plate of couscous beside them. Oh well, I can't wait t0 treat myself and have some Mcnuggets at the end of my competitions! After they left, we had our daily video session where we focus on what to imprive for the upcoming practice. The spirit was really good and we were really productive. We, then, left all together for the Water Cube to watch the duet final competition. It was really exciting to see the top 12 duets in the World performing back to back and being able to compare them. Right after that, we jumped into our suits for a pratice of an our in the cold pool. It was good the have Marie-Pier (one of the duet girl that also swim in the team) back in the patterns, because she was focusing on duet the 2 days before. We were swimming with only 7 in the patterns. 10 minutes later, we were sitting in special Canada cars to go to the further training pool. The goal today was to do quality on the first time. It took a little while at first, but we got in pretty good by the end. It is now 9 o'clock and we are in a bus going back in the Village, I'm also really looking forward to swim in the competition pool tomorrow and show everyone else what we are made of!!!

Re-Thinking Soup and the Community Farm (both on the UIC campus) need volunteers. You can see more pictures of the community farm here . About Re-Thinking Soup: Every Tuesday from 12:00-1:00pm, the Hull-House Museum hosts a modern day soup kitchen that is a public and communal event where we gather together and eat delicious, healthy, soup and have fresh, organic conversation about many of the urgent social, cultural, economic and environmental food issues that we should be addressing. Jane Addams was the first American woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and worked on many issues in her life to create the conditions of peace to flourish. We meet in the historic Residents' Dining Hall, where Upton Sinclair, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. Du Bois, Gertrude Stein and other important social reformers met to share meals and ideas, debate one another, and conspire to change the world. Activists, farmers, doctors, economists, artists, and guest chefs join us each week to present their knowledge, ideas and projects and foster a space where we can move toward solutions. The mission for the farm reflects our belief that monocultures are undesirable and dangerous for the environment and that promoting a pluralistic society is essential for a healthy democracy. The Heirloom Farm at the Hull-House Museum affirms the link between a healthy, diverse bio-culture that is sustained by varieties of heirloom fruits and vegetables, and a vibrant and diverse culture in society, promoted by artisans, farmers, ethnic restaurants and markets and by the people who support these spaces. YES WE CAN!

It was a moment of garden blogger synchronicity This week there was a moment of Chicago gardener synchronicity that occurred across a few Chicago garden bloggers that should be documented. Mr Brown Thumb started the week inside the Garfield Park Conservatory and The Garden of Live Flowers ended the week with a post that started inside the same location. Maybe the rainy weather made them think of drier climates. Chicago Garden looked up and was mesmerized by Northern Catalpa tree blooms and Garden Girl looked up and saw the same flowers and possibilities. Chicago Gardener's Journal harvested garlic scapes and so did My Skinny Garden , maybe they're planning a dinner garden party to surprise us with. In the winter and spring of 2009 an organizing committee consisting of five Chicagoland garden bloggers was formed and organized an event called Chicago Spring Fling. It was a gathering of garden bloggers from across the country. The archive for the event can be found here . For several of us this was the first time we had met in person. After the event we decided we wanted to keep in touch with each other and meet more of our Chicagoland garden bloggers.

Yesterday morning I was annoyingly awoken by the changing of the guards, which made me think - maybe I spoke too soon about this normal thing.  When I say changing of the guards, I don't mean the fancy speal they do at Arlington National Cemetery (how great would that be though?).   What I do mean, is that at around 4am-ish the lovely gentleman who so kindly have watched over the house all night and patrolled now go home to their families and taking their place are more nice gentleman.  Really, I am not being facetious, they are very kind.  As the new guards come in, they are instructed to check their guns to ensure they are locked and loaded (ahh, I learn the meaning of locked and loaded! - but shouldn't it be loaded and then locked?).  Well,  we are in The Ghanny, so not everything is in tip top condition, so if you don't spiffy up that gun, you can imagine how many times you might have to ensure it is properly loaded, or locked - heck, I am not even going to pretend I know what they are doing.  All, I know is that they are making that 'chich-chich' noise over and over and over again at 4 FREAKING AM.  It was like a literally wake up call - no, Anna, your life is not normal.  Better yet, the neighbor guards thought this was going to be a musscle fest, so they started flexing too.   Hello, we are sleeping.
As several of you know . . . our older cat Jersey passed away in January. Jersey was 16 years old and had used up many of her 9 lives over the years. Liver problems, eating issues, a Hyperthyroid and old age to name a few of her challenges. Her kidneys decided to retire at the end of January. As sad as it was to put her down . . . we new it was time. She was a good girl and I miss her. ~~~~ This left our much younger cat Holly without a feline friend. We were informed by the local Humane Society that her brother was in foster care and would likely be available for adoption at the end of February. Last week we brought home Sidney. . . . Yes, as in "Sidney Crosby" for all you Canadian hockey fans :D. Sid the Kid scored the winning overtime goal for the Canadian Olympic Hockey Team. This active little guy will try his best to live up to his name sake. Looks a lot like his sister ~ don't you think? Double Trouble I guess :D He is 6 months younger though ~ same mother, different litter. ~~~~ Their mother is available at the Ottawa Humane Society if anyone is interested in adopting her. She prefers a family without dogs . . . so we chose the brother instead. As for my wonder pup Cider . . . she can't keep up with all this feline change. Big yawn! Just let me know when everyone is settled in she says. ~~~~ Many beautiful Lace and Linen Bridal Hankies are available in my Etsy Shop . I just love when vintage hankies retain their original stickers ~ Pure Linen ~ Made in Austria. It doesn't get much better than that! I also have the most beautiful Net Lace child's gown. It has a tiny separation at the shoulder that I need to mend before I list it . . . but just look at that lace! Absolutely Gorgeous! I have some Victorian Bloomers to list as well ~ pintucks and lace all around. Irish Crochet is a personal favourite! These hankies are just too pretty to use ~ perfect for your wedding day. I also listed this lovely tablecloth and napkin set recently. My new supervisor . . . she is very quiet and doesn't touch a thing :D She has learned to "stay" and watch while I photograph my work. How good is that ! Well, the meet and greet (existing dog ~ new cat) has been going quite slowly. Sweet little kitty has very sharp claws . . . . and Cider is not used to young cats that run at turbo speed. "Who me?" says Holly. My ability to trim those tiny little claws is also a work in progress. Holly is doing well using her scratching post, but it doesn't really trim her nails. So far the meetings have involved me holding Cider's collar and the cat keeping a respectful distance. We have progressed beyond the peeking door technique . . . but I can't hold the dog and use my camera, lol. I admitted to my daughter this week that I am indeed a bit nervous about the first unrestrained meeting. . . with no leash or collar involved. She assumed I was worried about the kitten (ha!) and recently realized I am actually more worried about the dog. Cider only has experience with declawed, geriatric cats. I think Cider is in for a shock when she discovers that cats do have claws. "OMG!" My daughter exclaimed. . . . "you're more worried about the dog!" Well . . . maybe, I replied. I have seen an upset cat jump on a dog's back before, with all four sets of claws digging in. Not so fun for our canine friends. So . . . slow and steady it goes. In the mean time Cider likes the new food bowls, new plush and feathery cat toys and bouncing balls with bells : ) I have had several requests recently for vintage hats . . . so I added several to my Etsy shop Rhinestones and Feathers . . . White Millinery . . . an Easter Bonnet perhaps. Pretty in Pink ~ Any Time of Year! Some wonderful Flapper shoes from the 1920s ~ Love those beaded Buckles And more velvet with embroidered detail. ~~~ Have a great weekend ~~~~ Thanks for visiting ~~~ ~~~ I have some lovely winter accents and pretty hats for sale in my Etsy Shop . There are still a few months of winter remaining in Canada. Maybe Ottawa should send some snow out West to help with the Winter Olympics. I hear the Apple trees are in blossom in Vancouver. Not so good for winter sports however. So . . . think snow . . . a few more months of winter yet : ) I have some very pretty Wool Scarves. Neutrals and pretty colours. Several nice shawls ~ handmade Crochet and Cashmere . . . Handmade sweaters from Scotland too! Warm and Pretty. ~ A few more months of Winter Woolies in Canada ~ Well . . . our new cat was keen to explore today . . . so what's a pet owner to do? "Do you want to meet the dog?" I asked her. I know you know there IS a dog. Likewise the dog knows there is a new cat. They most certainly know ~ even if they haven't met. So into the cat crate Holly went. I put her up high so she had a good view and would still feel safe. Cider and I have been reviewing our obedience training for the last few days to make sure she has that sit/stay in good form. Can you see Holly peeking out the side of the cat crate? I wish I could see Holly's face in this photo . . . .Wowza ~ what big ears you have! What a good sit-stay, Cider. Let's go back to playing with the 7 pounder for today. Much more relaxing. Jersey seems to have found her inner youth. So far so good : ) Holly's feline kennel cough is gone now so we have been working on introductions for the last few days. All the info I have read online about introducing new pets says to focus on one pet introduction at a time. We have a cat and a dog. Cider is our 80 pound dog. We decided to start small ~ with our little 7 pound cat. She's 15 years old and the living room is one of her favorite places to hang out . It is quiet and has lots of sunbeams from 9:00am to 3:00pm. This information was quickly shared with the new arrival. Today they made some progress. I'll let you sit on my chair with "my pillow" . . . . If I get first choice of any sunbeam I want. OK . . . . I'm easy to get along with. Relaxing in the proximity of the new pet is considered a very good sign. Jersey is right below this chair ~ so they are very close together. ~~~~ Now tell me about that dog that lives here . . . . (Oh . . . that's next week's lesson I think!) Back to work after the holidays ~ All the decorations are down and put away. It was nice to get back to work. I listed six coats today in my Ciderantiques Etsy Shop . I also paid a visit to the Background Fairy after seeing all her pretty backgrounds in blogland. I am having fun playing around with all the pretty options. Thank you Background Fairy! The coats and capes have all passed local inspection :D I have wool coats, capes and faux prints. Several different sizes to choose from. Mostly from the 1960s. Yep . . . definitely faux fur . . . says my helper. Hope you are warm and cozy ~ it was certainly cold here today.

The pots of giant amaryllis bulbs are lined up in a row in front of the eastern windows. All year long I wait, water and watch. It starts sometime in January when the first little green nub starts to push up through the dark soil. I wait more and check the other pots to see if there are any more tentative green shoots. Within the next month they all start to push upward in various stages. Usually the giant crimson flowers are first with the lightly blushing pink ones last. The display goes on in the eastern light for weeks filling my home with various shades of crimson, scarlet, white, and pink until finally the last bloom fades and they all rest once again.

I have always loved this book as well as the companion book, Through the Looking Glass , since I was a child. So naturally I had to see the recent Alice in Wonderland movie starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. I was charmed by Tim Burton's original approach to the characters of Wonderland.

Dad was with us and at 70 was not up for climbing a mountain, but he was beaming from ear to ear to be in the mountains. We stopped often, looking at a small flower, commenting on the clear mountain water in the small stream that would turn into a mighty river. The clouds rolled in just as we reached a beaver pond. The mound of branches in the middle of the pond looked fresh and evidence surrounded us of this little animal's industriousness. Then it happened. Gentle drops began to fall. They left their beautiful mark on the still water and then disappeared. It was a moment I will always cherish. Summer Rain A summer walk along the Colorado River in Rocky Mountain National Park started out warm and sunny.

(February 2009) I am an earth mama with a water spirit heart. Living in the Colorado Rocky Mountains gives me sustenance for my earth side. Their solid permanence gives me strength. But once in awhile my water spirit thirsts for salty oceans, serene lakes, and rivers wet and wild. I have not had my ocean fix recently but instead have found untamed waters and calm shores right here in Colorado. The first two photos were taken in Rocky Mountain National Park on a summer hike next to the St. Vrain River. It has been my favorite river in the park since I first discovered it in 1975. And as the surrounding terrain changes from fires and natural selection, the river still rages down the steep mountainside careening over the same rocks. I find timeless energy there. The last photo is of Horsetooth Reservoir just west of Fort Collins, Colorado. It is about four miles east of my mountain home and I can see it out my windows with the morning sun reflecting golden off its surface or a full moon making it a pool of pale light.

g ready to head out, we recieved an invite to preview an art gallery that was getting ready for 'Dia de los Muertos'. Besides it presented me with an opportunity to take more pics! Dia de los Muertos also known as The Day of the Dead, is a holiday celebrated in Mexico and by Latin Americans living in the United States and Canada. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. The celebration occurs on November 1st, and 2nd in connection with the Catholic holiday of All Saints' Day which occurs on November 1st and All Souls' Day which occurs on November 2nd. Traditions include building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these gifts.   We actually enjoyed our visit at the art gallery as well as the rest of our ride. I still have alot to learn about my camera and hope to post more often. Thanks for stopping by! Remember my post back in April, about The Cherylann of the Hotel Jeffrey Benefit? Well Cherylann posted this comment to me October 14th and I decided to post it.Sheila &amp; Friends,What a pleasure running across your site!Thank-you sooo much for being a part of the benefit run that my friends put on in April. What an amazing day filled with soooo many familiar faces and...some new ones. Guests who have frequented our saloon &amp; grill and stayed in our hotel since we bought it in 2003
Iris sent in this photo of a beautiful Basil Mung Bean Salad she made. "It's simple to make, but tastes delicious!" Find the recipe at The Daily Dietribe . Ishita writes, "This beautiful stir fry is the base for my special Thai curry whose recipe I make up every time I cook! "Just look at the colors! What's not to like? Cooking with color is the best part of creating my own meals, and it keeps my diet well balanced and me happy!" Ventures With Veggies made this colorful tabouleh-inspired salad with leftover quinoa, diced carrots, cucumber, peppers, and some diced apple and raisins for sweetness. "The result was tasty, delicious, healthy, and filling!" Check out the recipe, called Hippie Tabouleh! More oven roasted goodness! Molly Lee writes, "I made these oven-roasted brussels sprouts for dinner tonight. They were incredible! I think even people who think they don't like brussels sprouts would enjoy these... "To make them, cut off the brown ends of your fresh sprouts and any old-looking leaves. Drop them into boiling water and cover. After 3 minutes, drain them quickly and replace the water with cold water to stop them from overcooking. "Cut in half and toss with some olive oil and salt. Lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet and put in a hot, 425 degree oven, for about 30 minutes, stirring them around occasionally. "Remove when they're gorgeously brown. They're incredible!" Hi Jennifer, Iris at The Daily Diettribe writes, "I've been making Roasted Acorn Squash and Brussels Sprouts a lot lately. Adding just a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper, and allowing it to roast until it begins to caramelize creates a sweet and delicious snack. And the brussel sprouts taste great cold the next day!" Follow the link above to the recipe! Selene writes, "Oven roasted vegetables are one of my favourite dishes to make, because it's such an easy and tasty way to get tons of veggies. Here I've paired it with a creamy garlic-y cashew sauce." Recipe at Veganlicious ! Amy wrote in to share another one with us: "I just made this and felt that someone who appreciates food and health combined should see it! I call it the SULTAN. I wrapped it up and it was unbelievably delicious, and RAW! It was made with soaked buckwheat, and lemon, coriander, sea salt, golden curry powder, tomato, cumin, and some reverse osmosis water to make it easier to blend." Jaylyn from Lipstick & Granola writes, "This was my yummy dinner the other night: white potatoes and garlic, fresh from the farmers market (yes, we have one in the winter)! I simply roasted the potatoes and garlic in the oven with pine nuts, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and served them on top of steamed Swiss chard. The flavors went perfectly together!"
This man made-do with whatever was handy. The poor guy was splashed repeatedly by passing traffic. Well, that's how a friend of mine refers to The Captain's Arms, a local pub that's jumping once the weather turns cooler in Abu Dhabi. Like almost all liquor-serving establishments, it's located in a hotel (private clubs can serve, as well). These photos, taken with my camera phone after a few tasty pints, are of a 3 man band that starts in the Italian restaurant directly beside the Captain's Arms (Papagallo's) and eventually wanders over to pub's customers playing pretty much any song you request. Give them a 20 or 30 dirhams, and they'll hang around your table for a few extra songs. Oh, how the 'kids' love these! They zip, they zoom, and they generally annoy...especially if you're in the desert and trying to keep your activity of duning a safe one. I posted a cooler dune buggy shot here. I felt it worthy of a post. These photos were taken by my mother in Ohio. If you haven't seen the stories, the east coast of the US (all the way down to Florida) has been hit with record-breaking lows, while up north they've been dumped on with snow. My parents live in what Great Lakes folks like to call the snow belt. These photos are evidence of the snow belt.Those are deck chairs and table covered in snow.
Format: Trade Paperback, 208 pages Publisher: Other Press ISBN : 978-1-59051-326-2 (1-59051-326-6) Pub Date: June 30, 2009 Price: $18.95 In recent years, there has been no shortage of expat-written nonfiction books set in Beijing, but fiction in the same category is hard to come by. That is why Jonathan Tel's new story collection, The Beijing of Possibilities , caught my eye the moment I saw it on the Commonwealth Writers' Prize 2010 short list (thanks, Leela Soma and Rob) . It's a slim little volume with a most intriguing cover art of a pretty Chinese lady with what appears to be sightless eyes. When friends and I first saw the cover design we had a nice discussion of what that might signify...was she looking "inside" herself or was she deliberately refusing to "see" that which is obvious to everyone else? Don't you just love cover art that intrigues? I did some research on the art and found out it has been taken from the Reed Darmon collection. Reed Darmon is the person responsible for the "Made in China" graphics book and you can learn more about it here . To come back to the stories...all twelve invoke Beijing in some way or the other even if the stories themselves vary widely in time period and location. The most notable aspect of Tel's storytelling is how he recounts modern facts about China but interwoven with Chinese folk tales (and superstitions). The Monkey Legend seems to be his favorite one and the first story of the collection "Year of the Gorilla" begins with the sentence, "It's been a while since the Monkey King set out on his Journey to the West" , with "A Journey to the West" being the title of this much-loved legend and folk tale. Another trait I noticed is his ability to blend old China with the new and no story illustrates that better than " The Most Beautiful Woman In China.” which links together two thousand years of Chinese history, while being set in Beijing today! One generic character that makes his or her appearance in many of the stories is the 'Chinese migrant' and after reading a lot of topical articles on China I have come to the realization that Beijing, even more than Shanghai, is a mecca for the Chinese people...it is the land of opportunity, the land where dreams come true or as Tel himself describes in the title, it is the land full of possibilities. "Beijing is the center of the universe. Ask anybody who lives there. “The true Beijinger secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be, in some sense, kidding.” —in a foreword by Helan Xiao One of my favorite migrant characters in this collection is from the title story. Miss Xu is a fisherman's daughter but "foster" mother to the child of a young couple in Beijing. The couple have hired Miss Xu to look after their as-yet-unborn child because they are too busy to care for the child themselves..in ten or twelve years time they'll be ready to take the child to live with them. Unfortunately the child dies before they could hand it over to Miss Xu but because she had been registered in Bejing as a "foster mother" Miss Xu lands herself an unexpected ticket to residency in Beijing which is to most Chinese what an American green card is to refugees! Ofcourse, being a "hick" from Hainan (a sleepy little fishing village) she was treated as an outcast in Beijing which makes for a very moving story. Tel also has this ability to infuse his stories with playful plots and language. Amusing, but a little sad too, is "The Book of Auspicious and Inauspicious Dreams" where a young, modern couple, during renovations to their 1960's home, chance upon a rusty tin of souvenirs buried in a wall of their suburban Beijing house. Realizing it must belong to the previous owner they do everything to try to return the tin, only to be met with exclamations of protests from the previous owner who insisted she had never laid eyes on the tin before and that she "loved Chairman Mao more than her own mother and father" which reminds the reader of a turbulent time in China's history where to be a lover of the arts or to have "western" things meant having a "bourgeois" background which in turn meant being sent to the villages for "reeducation"...something that was a tough and humiliating experience for most intellectuals. I found a couple of the stories had the overall effect of looking at a subtly distorted mirror but for the most part Tel's prose and plots are smart, entertaining, observant and insightful. It's most definitely a collection to cherish . Oh, and before I go...I haven't been able to explain the girl on the cover. My best guess is that she is "Little Yu" from the heart warmingly sad story, "The Three Lives of Little Yu" about a childless couple who adopt a little girl whom they call "Yu" only to have her snatched away by the god of death. They adopt a second girl and call her "Yu" too, but the same fate awaits her. When the third girl, again called "Yu" enters their family it is implied that she is a reincarnation of the previous little girls. So could the girl on the cover have been Yu between her lives on earth? I guess I am getting carried away. I'll bet you not even Jonathan Tel thought about his cover as much as I have! :) Oh and whatever you do, don't miss the last story....there's a nice twist in the tale there, a brilliant narrative coup! Two insightful reviews that might interest you are: L. Dean Murphy at The Book Reporter and Happy Reader at Book Closet And finally, some entertainment! A clip from the pop opera, "Monkey: Journey to the West" (Coming soon: 08 April in the UK and 29June in the US) For a polygamist like Baba Segi , his collection of wives and a gaggle of children are the symbol of prosperity, success and validation of his manhood. Everything runs reasonably smoothly in the patriarchal home, until wife number four intrudes on this family romance. Bolanle , a graduate amongst the semi-literate wives, is hated from the start. Baba Segi's glee at bagging a graduate doesn't help matters. Worse, Bolanle's arrival threatens to do more than simply ruffle feathers. She's unwittingly set to expose a secret that her co-wives intend to protect, at all costs. Lola Shoneyin's light and ironic touch exposes not only the rotten innards of Baba Segi's polygamous household in this cleverly plotted story; it also shows how women no educated or semi-literate, women in contemporary Nigeria can be as restricted, controlled and damaged by men - be they fathers, husbands, uncles, rapists - as they've never been. Harper Collins Canada Downtown Mogadishu today is beat-up and bone-white from the sun and a coating of dust. It is overlaid with a deceptive grid of empty streets. Most buildings are ransacked shells frozen in time or have simply vanished. Today, when we think of Somalia we think civil war, Somali pirates, Islamic fundamentalism, so how very refreshing to chance upon "Black Mamba Boy" which takes us back to a thriving Somalia of yesteryear, and not just Somalia, but Djibouti, Sudan, Eritrea, Egypt...a veritable tour of North-East Africa in the mid-30's. Let me explain: "Black Mamba Boy"by Somali-British author Nadifa Mohamed is based on the true story of the author’s father’s life. Opening in 1930's Aden we are introduced to Jama, a ten year-old Somali boy, a street kid, whose mother dies unexpectedly thus leaving him alone in this world. " Jama is forced home to his native Somalia, the land of his nomadic ancestors. War is on the horizon and the fascist Italian forces who control parts of east Africa are preparing for battle. Yet Jama cannot rest until he discovers whether his father, who has been absent from his life since he was a baby, is alive somewhere. And so begins an epic journey which will take Jama north through Djibouti, war-torn Eritrea and Sudan, to Egypt. And from there, aboard a ship transporting Jewish refugees just released from German concentration camp, across the seas to Britain and freedom." OK, my challenge here as a "reviewer" is how to give you my impressions without gushing or using a great many superlatives, so I'll just say this: if you choose to read the book, you're in for an amazing ride through the dusty, noisy but bustling streets of the some of the most important cities of North East Africa in the '30's. From the vast sandy deserts of Sudan to narrow busy alleys in Somalia, from the tree-lined manicured boulevards of Djibouti to the emerald-green landscape with juicy mango trees of Abyssinia, you will see it all! Mohamed's prose zings with the vibrancy of North African life, an unfamiliar landscape of strange tribes and tongues, bizarre rituals, superstitions and tribal kinship. The sensitive way in which she handles Jama's relationships with his family and kinsmen, tugs at one's heartstrings. In a historical context I cannot vouch for Mohamed's accuracy because I know so little about that area and in that time period, but it is told so well, you get completely swept up by the events and happenings. But central to the story is suffering...the suffering of the African people at the hands of their colonizers. Mohamed's acute and unsparing descriptive powers render vivid everything from Aden street chaos to traditional Palestinian wedding in Khan Younis, but her clipped depiction of the death by torture of a young Somalian man at the hands of two drunk Italians made me gasp out loud and pushed me way out of my comfort zone into a place I wasn't sure I wanted to be. And that's not a bad thing because when I read I want to be astonished, I want to be moved, I want to be shaken to the core and Mohamed succeeds in doing this. Having said all this though, for me, the most moving part of the account is when Jama finds employment as a deck hand on board the "Runnymede Park" at Haifa, Palestine. "Runnymede Park" was a British prison ship carrying thousands of Jewish refugees originally from Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and Treblinka who were denied permission to disembark in Palestine (their Promised Land) but instead taken back to Europe to be made an example out of (thereby deterring other would-be Jewish immigrants from making the trip to Palestine). Her descriptions of the agony (physical and mental) that the poor refugees suffered are so vivid, I could literally hear the crash of broken dreams and feel the dejection in my own chest. If you enjoy Africa, history, travel (the story weaves its way through a labyrinth of countries), stories of exile and survival...this one is definitely for you! Hardcover: 368 pages Publisher: Little, Brown and Company; 1 edition (Jun 9 2008) Language : English "Luxurious Hearses" is this ( "Say You're One of Them") collection's fourth and longest story but perhaps its most important. I see it as important because more than any other story I have read here so far, it is this one that brings to life the political, economic and religious strife we read so much about in Africa. The story, set in Nigeria , illuminates the political situation of Nigeria, the poverty of the people in the Nigerian Delta, the tension between the Muslims in the North and the Christians in the south and what happens when innocent people get caught in between. After you read this longish nouvella you come away, seeing with new eyes why every now and again Nigeria plunges into Muslim-Christian riots and why, despite all the oil that Nigeria possesses, its people are so poor. Our protagonist in this story is a 16-year old boy called Jubril who is forced to head south (towards the Christian part of Nigeria) after riots broke out in his very-Muslim city of Khamfa which is in the north. Ordinarily Jubril may not have had to run away, but when his own Muslim friends turned against him for having a Christian father (whom he had never seen or known) he decided that if he was interested in saving his life it would be prudent for him to leave his town and Muslim mother (and her family) and head south to be reunited with his Christian dad. The story of his journey from the North to South in the midst of some of the worst religious riots Nigeria has ever seen with a host of wonderfully- colourful characters that are his bus companions; his fears and insecurities about heading to a part of the country that is so alien to him and his perpetual fear of being found out as a Muslim in bus full of Christian refugees is riveting, suspenseful and unputdownable! The reader is as tense as Jubril who is forced to try and blend in with the other people on the bus, a task made much more difficult because his right hand was lopped off when he was arrested for stealing a goat months before. As always, Akpan's writing holds you spellbound. Most of the story takes place on the bus with occasional flashbacks to Jubrail's life in Khamfa before he had to flee. As a reader you are privy to all the conversations that place on the bus...the fears, egos, anger and other emotions that the passengers bring with them; power dynamics between the well off and the not so well off,the sick and the healthy. Many a time, like Oprah, I got so claustrophobic from being on that bus I had this strong urge to jump off and yet, the writing and the thought of what might happen next kept me glued to the pages. "An Ex-Mas Feast" was audacious, "The Fattening of Gabon" was downright sad, but "Luxurious Hearses" is gruesome. You're going to need a strong stomach to endure the second half of the novel. Gruesome it might be but at no point do you get the feeling the author is aiming for sensationalism, instead, you come away feeling deeply for the characters, the victims and the persecutors alike, for you come to understand that each man is simply doing all he can to survive. Since each of the five stories in this book are set in different countries in Africa, you might want to use Howard French's "A Continent for the Taking" or even Richard Dowden's "Africa: Altered States, Ordinary Miracles" as a companion read. I found both very helpful in explaining Africa to me. "Fattening for Gabon" is Uwem Akpan's second story (nouvella length at 130 pages) in the collection, "Say You're One of Them" . It starts off innocently enough with a young (10-year old) boy narrating how his maternal uncle offers to take him and his 5-year old sister to live with him on the border of Benin and Gabon because the boy's parents are dying of AIDS and too poor and sick to look after the children, but the story very gradually starts to take on a sinister tone which gets completely brutal towards the end. “Selling your child or nephew could be more difficult than selling other kids” : that is the blunt line with which “Fattening for Gabon” begins. I wish so much Akpan hadn't used that opening line because it really does give it all away. The story is so beautifully written that had Akpan waited to reveal this, say about halfway through the story, I think the reader would have been shaken to the core (and which reader doesn't mind being shaken?) Anyway, what's done is done and this other child-narrated story succeeds in provoking the whole gamut of emotions, from incredulity to disgust and from confusion to absolute fear in the reader. For me, the biggest issue here was child manipulation, I could have screamed at all of the adults in this story and cheerfully lined up against a wall to be shot. I know, I know some of you might think I am over reacting but you know, when Uwem Akpan was interviewed he stated that all these stories were drawn from real people he met and counselled in his years as a Jesuit Priest. Just to know that there are adults like this makes my blood boil. Again, as in the previous story, one of Akpan's strengths is in how he slips into the skins of his characters no matter what gender or age they might be. He also has such a gift for description and narration. There are several scenes that stand out for me in this story, the main one being the Thanksgiving service at church that Fofo Kpee(the uncle) organizes in order to give thanks for his (ill-begotten) gain. Akpan describes the procession, the dancing, the characters, their clothes, the gifts, the priest's invocations, the offertory to god and the elation the family feels to be given so much importance on that day, so vividly it is literally like watching the service unfold on a cinematic screen. What a writer this man is! Something I liked very much 
and that's probably because I listened to this on audio as well as read it in print) is Akpan's frequent use of the local dialect in the dialogue. Four colloquial languages were used in this particular story...English, French Idaatcha and Egun sometimes in the same paragraph. I have spoken to people who found that distracting...not me!!! I guess knowing a little French does help speed the read along. Last, but not least...the title is very conversation-worthy...but that, I'm afraid, will be a whole different post!

All the stories in this collection can be read as stand-alone stories and because they are all so stunning, revealing and heartbreaking I feel like they deserve to be written about individually rather than together, so I here I go with a few thoughts on the first story and a link to where you can read the story for yourself: "An Ex-Mas Feast" , about a very young child prostitute and set in a slum in Nairobi, can be a tough story to read and if you're feeling particularly fragile it is, perhaps, not a story you will want to read. It's about tough situations and people just trying to do their best with the rotten cards they've been dealt. Although the lives of these protagonists and their stories will leave you shaking your head, Akpan makes no judgement on his characters and neither must you. Although this is a short story, Akpan manages to bring up several important issues like the importance of education in finding a way out of poverty, hunger, survival, family bonds and the importance of family especially at festival time.

The central characters, Ram and Sita, are brought together by their families in what is commonly known as an "arranged marriage" in India. Although Sita is a well educated, independent young woman who longs to fall in love, she allows herself to be talked into marriage with Ram a young medic based in Glasgow because she knows that is what is expected of her. I thought Soma captured very well the painful familial expectations that all of us growing up in India have experienced. Unfortunately for the couple they have nothing in common. Ram is a fastidious and earnest young man who has a hard time showing his emotions. Sita is a vivacious, intelligent, chatty and emotional young lady who simply cannot understand why Ram cannot be more demonstrative, caring or expressive. Unlike some of the other books with immigration as a theme, Sita doesn't have major problems adjusting to her new life in Glasgow. After all, she is a convent-educated young girl steeped in an English education that was primed and prepared for Cambridge".. .an Indian in every outward way, but with the thoughts and aspirations of a liberally-educated middle class westerner. " What she cannot come to terms with is having a marriage devoid of romance. Sita and Ram soon get caught up in their separate lives but continue to be bound together by duty, familial and societal expectations, their daughter Uma and other cultural trappings. Soma carefully unravels the story of this stifling, but moving marriage. She does so without melodrama and with careful attention to the couple’s mundane moments of tenderness. Both characters are extremely likable but both have their flaws and I found it impossible to take sides. The two are ably supported by a chorus of other great characters like BB , the resident old gossip; Lata , Sita's best friend and confidante; Eileen , a wee Scottish lass who marries a Muslim doctor only to regret it and Neil , Sita's paramour. Beyond the marriage and family, this novel deals with the momentous themes of love and belonging, it is also an examination of immigration, identity, walking the tightrope between two distinct cultures and so on. Most immigrants inhabit an in-between space that is a little difficult to describe, but Leela, being an immigrant herself has ably captured and given life to that space when she says (and I paraphrase), An immigrant's affection for his or her adopted country and its people ranges from highs to lows. On days when homesickness prevails nothing seems right with the city...on the other hand, the sheer freedom of being able to live life away from the watchful eyes of society and family back home can be exhilarating! I thought Soma very ably introduces her readers to Glasgow, a city many of us are not so familiar with and I thought her idea of introducing colloquial Scottish phrases through the book helped steep the narrative in local flavour. The history and anthropological buffs amongst us will be quite impressed at how the Scots and the people of Madras influenced each other. Much of the story is set against the political landscape of Sccotland from the 1970's to the present day and that makes for interesting reading too. This is a story of immigration in the late '70's (1979) to be precise and having emigrated from India to Canada in 2001 I found it very interesting to compare Sita's immigration experience with mine. I think it's so much easier today...for one thing, staying in touch with the home country is a cinch because of the internet, also, one never has to crave for home food or cooking supplies as almost every neighborhood has its own ethnic stores, not to mention cable television companies that beam programmes from India right into your living room. Sita had to wait weeks to make a "trunk-call" when she wanted to speak to her parents...however, I think it made for a more determined assimilation into one's adopted culture. Today, many immigrants continue to live exactly as they did at home. They don't feel the need to assimilate and many are not encouraged to. Good thing? Bad thing? I guess only time will tell. Do pick up a copy (available from Amazon and Book Depository) and treat yourself to this delightful read!

Having said that, however, I'd like to ask you this: what is the biggest sacrifice you would make, not for a friend, a lover or even a family member, but for a stranger, someone you don't know, someone you will gain nothing from? Now that's a tough one, isn't it? Some people are driven to altruistic lengths to help a stranger in need. Many will donate money and time, or both. Some will make radical donations of a healthy kidney or liver to to people in need. Buddhists are well known for a ritual where they take on other people's sufferings, but all these actions, wonderful as they are, are usually premeditated and the giver has had time for prepare himself or herself for this sacrificial gift. Would we be as giving if we're taken by surprise and with an urgency that leaves no room for thinking or planning? "Little Bee" is the story of two such strangers and how their fates intertwine one fateful summer's day in Nigeria. The central theme of the story examines how despite deep-seated convictions, life unfairly places a disproportionate emphasis on the decisions we make in split seconds. Other prominent themes in the book include asylum seekers, the state of detention centers in the UK and issues a challenge to its readers to ponder why the word "refugee" has become such an ugly word in today's parlance. For instance, why is it that in late 60's and even early '70's defectors from the then USSR, or other European communists state were cheered on and even celebrated as heroes, but today we balk at having to share our resources with their countrymen. Why do we treat refugees as criminals, locking them away until their cases can be heard? Why do their cases take so long to hear? The novel is a bittersweet one and told in two voices (the two main female protagonists that we spoke of earlier in the review). This works well because the two women are from opposite sides of the great class divide and by hearing both their voices the reader gets a dual perspective instead of just one. About the characters, I am not sure I could be friends with any of them in real life, but they made for great character studies! So, to summarize, this is a novel that is sad and yet funny; serious and yet light-hearted; heavy and yet it's only a wisp of a novel...overall a lovely reading experience! This novel is called "The Other Hand" in the UK and in India and the rest of the sub-continent. Anyone know why novels are sometimes given different titles in different parts of the world?
The last week was all over the board for me. Every time I thought I had it under control again, it wriggled free, kicked me in the shins and ran away laughing. I hate weeks like that, but they offer perspective too. At one point, today, after feeling particularly "Monday" in attitude, it occurred to me how much better this Monday is than the last one. It was while I was playing (eternal) catch-up on some blog reading. I was reading Cass Just Curious . Her blog is special. Something about the way she writes--and the photos, oh the photos!--just...speaks to me. I felt lighter. Perspective is a funny thing. We're so entrenched in what's happening Right Now, that sometimes we forget how much and how often things can change. A bad day today doesn't -have- to mean a bad day tomorrow. Or a bad week as the case may be. Last week is in the books. This week, I'm going back to being sunshiny. 1. First movie quote to pop into your head right now: Reporter at Spring Training: Where do the Sox rank in terms of importance in your life? Ben: I say the Red Sox... sex... and breathing. (Fever Pitch) 2. What was your fourth grade teacher's name? Mrs. Raap. 3. Have you ever been to Denver? Only if being in the airport counts. And that was also one pain-in-the-rear airport. It's one long strip, which means if your gate numbers are far apart, they are -really- far apart. 4. What is your favorite movie whose title begins with the letter C? Maybe "Coyote Ugly"? 5. What do you think is one of the worst television shows ever created? Not counting reality shows... (I'm sure I will be crucified for this) LOST. I hate tv shows that hurt my brain to watch them. 6. What do you recommend? Not catching the Norovirus. And if someone does catch it, bleach everything you own. If you can't bleach it, Lysol III it. Take my word for it. And if you don't take mine, take Troy's. 7. What is your favorite kind of nut to snack on? Cashews. Unless I'm at a ball game, then peanuts. -In- the shell. (But not boiled peanuts. Yuck.) 8. What kind of wedding did you have--or if you've never been married, what kind of wedding do you dream of having? I used to want the fairy tale. Now? ::shrugs:: I want the one that means it's real. I guess that means I grew up...? 9. What is the most beautiful place you have ever seen? The Catskill Mountains in the Autumn. Or Fenway Park. 10. What color are your toenails painted? ::hangs head in shame:: They aren't. It's not sandal weather for me quite yet. I promise they are properly groomed though! 11. What's the last thing you ordered online? Daniel's birthday gift. I got him a "official" Belichick hoodie. 12. By noon, I’m usually: Half-starved. I eat breakfast early so I am always very ready for lunch. 13. What is your favorite kind of gum? Extra Wintergreen. 14. What color "grass" in the Easter basket? Green! Preferably made of pale green paper. That plastic stuff is maddening. And I have always hated all the random colors. Who ever heard of bright pink grass?? 15. What's for dinner tonight? I had some pasta & some broccoli. I didn't feel much like cooking, so I went easy. 16. What is the last spice you used when cooking? Ummm... I didn't cook much last week, what with the getting over The Ick & all. And what I did make wasn't very spicy. I'm going to guess it was Montreal Steak Seasoning some time the week before last. 17. How many varieties of mustard are in your refrigerator right now? Just one. Grey Poupon Dijon. There will likely be a second coarse grain variety in there later this week. I need that one specifically for a recipe on the menu. 18. Zoo or museum? I love a good museum...but I get to feed giraffes at the zoo! I can't choose. It's just too hard. You're going to have to pick for me. 19. Favorite cracker? Anything wheat really. I like the flavor of it with cheese. 20. Which item from your wardrobe do you wear most often? My jeans. I wear a pair almost every day. yeah. so. ahem. first, i had some...stuff going on. then, i was at WDW with K . and again, adding Brandi . -then-, i had The Ick. (i'll spare you the details. i'm nice like that.) (sorry, if you "really" know me, because you didn't end up so lucky on the sparing of the details.) somehow that took over a little better than a week (??) and... ...now, i'm playing catch up. and apparently neglecting the blog in the process. i'm going to get my act together soon. cross my heart. photo of me courtesy of Brandi . we fed giraffes at the Lowry Park Zoo! yay zoo! 1) candle scents i burned this month: Sparkling Pine. Balsam &amp; Cedar. Mistletoe. Creme Brulee. Mountain Pine. Sparkling Cinnamon. Red Apple Wreath. Sparkling Angel. Hazelnut Coffee. Lakeside Birch. 2) what i am reading this month: i've had to put my other books on hold for the moment, while i focus on this whole " Bible in 90 Days " project. i am determined to succeed and i have to be honest, sometimes it takes a lot of brain power to get through twelve pages. (hello, books of Numbers, Deuteronomy and Leviticus!) i'm on track though! 3) top three songs i was drawn to: "Edge of Desire," John Mayer. "I'd Rather Be With You," Joshua Radin. "Some People," LeAnn Rimes. 4) movies i saw: Edge of Darkness. (not to be confused with "Edge of Desire" from number three. NOT.EVEN.CLOSE.) 5) favorite tv moments of the month: hearing The Star Spangled Banner play every time the U.S. won a gold medal. watching Evan Lysacek skate in the Men's Figure Skating competition with the same passion i love to see in my favorite baseball &amp; football athletes. the " Jacksonville " episode of Fringe: holy jaw-dropping wow. " Valentine's Day Massacre " (Grey's Anatomy): i'm loving the MerDer storyline this season. 6) something yummy i made: i've been baking fresh muffins for my mid-morning snack at work. apple spice. triple chocolate chunk . blueberry streusel. -yummy-. 7) restaurants where i ate: Rainforest Cafe. Longhorn Steakhouse. Macaroni Grill. Wine Exchange. 8) something that made me cry: that Canadian figure skater, Joannie Rochette, when she skated her short program a few days after her mother's sudden death. so much emotion and strength. i'm pretty sure it was impossible to watch her skate that program & not at least blink hard a couple of times. 9) a goal i had for this month: to start walking again after work. the weather has not cooperated with this goal. i -want- to walk, but i refuse to do so in the cold rain, so it didn't happen consistently. 10) this month i looked forward to: pitchers &amp; catchers reporting to Ft Myers. it's a long cold lonely three weeks between the Super Bowl and the start of Spring Training. 11) something that made me laugh: giraffe tongues. seriously. feed a giraffe some time & you'll see what i mean! 12) a photo i took this month: and a bonus photo, because i just couldn't choose! I am thinking... that this week is going to take forever. I am thankful for... flannel sheets. From the kitchen... will come roasted red potatoes and green beans with a rosemary butter sauce. the chicken will be from the grill. ;-) I am wearing... jeans and a navy blue button-down shirt. and my brown heeled boots. I am creating... a plan for the Disney parks this weekend! I am going... to meet K in FOUR DAYS!! I am reading... the Bible. in 90 days. it's challenging! I am hoping... i'm right. (sorry. no elaboration.) I am hearing... snickers from the office behind me. working with boys makes me shake my head. a lot. Around the house... is a big empty spot where Brandi 's Christmas gift was hanging out until Sunday when i saw her. i had to DUST.IT.OFF before i put it in my car. that's just sad. and really funny. One of my favorite things... is chatting with a wonderful friend &amp; being completely baffled how long you've actually been friends, because even though it feels like you always have been, you know that isn't the case! (this doesn't count for Heather because we've known each other since we were three, which is easy to remember because we met in nursery school. i really have known her forever!) i think it's a sign you truly click with another person when it just feels like you've always been friends. A few plans for the rest of the week... going out to dinner for Troy's birthday on Friday. and then WDW! with K all weekend (and Brandi too on Sunday)!!! A picture to share... Brandi and i went to the zoo on Sunday. we fed giraffes. giraffes have -really- long tongues. they can chase you with them if you have a cracker that they want! this leads to laughter. a LOT of laughter. they also don't like to take turns. they will try to swipe the cracker you are attempting to feed to another giraffe. and they can be sneaky about it since their tongue allows them to do this from like a half mile away! we also watched some storks of some sort bullying some pelicans. pelicans make this really loud honking sound. it's startling if you don't know this in advance! and the storks click their beaks really loudly. you wouldn't think this was terribly intimidating, but the pelicans would disagree with you. then again, i'm pretty sure i wouldn't hang around if a stork was clicking at me either. that beak is pointy! ;-) animals entertain me a great deal, in case this was not obvious to you. yay zoo! ----------------------------------- adding some photos from the zoo post-stream-of-consciousness. this orangutan was so funny. he was trying to nap but the sun was too bright! this little series goes hand in hand with my stream of consciousness! i had to share this one just to ask what the HECK is going on with my hair here?? i couldn't catch it in action, but these sting rays were actually coming up out of the water, begging for food! (it's an interactive tank.) 1. What current tv comedy is your favorite? The Big Bang Theory . it makes me laugh so.freaking hard. 2. Who is the fourth person on your cell phone's "missed calls" list? BrightHouse, calling to sell my faster internet. they were promptly ignored because at the time, they couldn't get the internet i was already paying for to work. i had less than zero intentions of spending more money for faster internet that still wouldn't work. 3. What kind of weather do you enjoy the most? March in Florida weather, which is much like Autumn in New England, minus the foliage: warm days. cool nights. gentle breezes. minimal humidity. sunny skies. and down here, March also brings orange blossoms. i'm pretty sure if heaven has a scent, it's orange blossoms. 4. I want something to drink. What's in your refrigerator right now? pineapple juice. cranberry juice (the pure unsweetened kind. none of this sissy, watered-down, sugared-up cranberry "juice" cocktail nonsense!). water. Pepsi. 2% milk. 5. You're planning a trip--money is not a concern--do you opt to travel by plane or take a road trip instead? road trip!! as long as i don't have to do the driving. ;-) 6. What is your favorite movie whose title begins with the letter H? it's a photo finish between "Hitch" and "Home Alone." 7. Do you enjoy cookouts? i do. sometimes nothing is more tasty than a burger or a hot dog right from the grill. 8. What was your sixth grade teacher's name? Mr Ryskowski. 9. Where did you live in 1987? Bristol, Connecicut. 10. What's the "right way" to read a magazine? flip through it once quickly, making note of any articles you want to read more carefully later. then go back & read said articles. then remove anything you wish to save for later reference (recipes, decorating inspiration, gift ideas). then recycle! 11. What would make today a better day? knowing it would be followed by Monday off. i would also settle for whatever it is i am allergic to being done blooming. 12. What was the last song to get stuck in your head? hmmm... it's been a while. long enough that i cannot recall. this is NOT an open invitation for you to implant yours in my head!! 13. Did you inherit your eye color from a family member? both of my parents, as well as my paternal grandfather, all have (or had, in the case of my Gramp) blue eyes. 14. Do you like fireworks? i do. i especially like the ones that "sparkle" at the tips. (man, i wish i could describe them better than that!) 15. What is your preferred outdoor temperature? 75 degrees. (but without the humidity!) 16. What three professions would you like to try for a day? See's Candies quality control test sampler. assistant to a wedding or infant photographer. Christmas elf (what?? sounds like fun!). 17. What do you do when you're stuck in traffic? turn up the music & sing along. not much else you -can- do. 18. Who was the last person you know who got married? Alison. July 2009. 19. Name three things that are overdue right now. sending Alison the photos i took at her wedding. a birthday card for my father's wife. the arrival of Spring weather in Florida. 20. If your mood were a weather forecast, today would be: bright blue clear skies & a lot of sunshine. it actually looks like Winter (well, like November in Connecticut anyway) down here this year! --------------------------- i saw the coolest post on the blog, "your wishcake," and thought it would be a lot of fun to incorporate it into my weekly Slice of Life posts. it's up to you, readers! what slice of my life would -you- like to see photographed &amp; shared here in the future?
The fading patina of the paint and the old looking school bus drew my attention to this billboard. If you enlarge the image you can see that is stenciled on plank boards which leads me to believe it has been there quite awhile. They just don't make them this way anymore. For more Ruby Tuesday join Mary here . Goldie and Spot The cold temps and snow and ice have been gone for a little over a week now and look who surfaced in the pond. This little pair came up from the bottom but they don't look like they're quite ready to stick their heads out yet. Or perhaps they're asking 'does this rock make our butts look big.' As I walked by yesterday I didn't see but heard a little frog plop into the water so the pond is indeed coming out of its long winter slumber. These sights and sounds are a wonderful prelude for what's to come and I can hardly wait! For more Camera Critters join Misty here . (enlarge for best detail) These were taken last week. We actually had 72 degree weather yesterday so the snow is long gone. Yeah!! I liked how the cattails were reflected in the water along the shoreline. This was a much closer shot and when I downloaded the photos of that day I was totally surprised. It looks like I was looking through glass. It reminds me of looking through a glass shower door, you know, the kind that you can never seem to get clean. :) For more Weekend Reflections join James here . I'm combining this week's Sepia Scenes with Mary's new Yard Art on Thursday meme. Last week my dear Hubs had a checkup with his doctor and as he was driving I spotted this 'outhouse' along the way. This was in someones side yard right along the highway. I have seen this done before but not as eloquently as this one. It sits in the center of a large flower bed with lights and plants and small shrubs arranged around the exterior. Hanging plants left from the last growing season adorned one side. I thought the moon and star cutouts the defining touch. I converted the color image that's below to sepia and added some texture to make the image look like an old postcard. Last week my yard art was a huge concrete cactus that my good friend Thom thought "why do I think that is so odd in your neck of the woods." I just KNOW he will think this much more appropriate. However, should anyone think the outhouse is only indicative of American Appalachia the country of Australia for example was largely unsewered until the early 1970s with many suburbs having outhouses or 'dunnys' behind each house. That was a mere 40 years ago. For more Sepia Scenes join Mary here . For more Yard Art join her here .

This past Monday the sky was trying so hard to peek out from behind the clouds. Hubs and I had been gone all day and when we arrived home I noticed all the melted puddles of snow in the driveway. The first shot above is looking in a puddle on the sidewalk with the nearby woods reflected and a hint of light blue sky. The second shot is the sun and sky reflected in a puddle on the driveway. For more Weekend Reflections join James here . You can see a full shot of the sky on my photoblog here . My first entry for Mary's Yard Art Thursday is this huge cactus. Hubs and I have passed this yard a few times in the past couple of years and it always struck me as a funny piece of yard art. It wasn't until Mary mentioned a new meme that I decided it was time to take a photo when we passed it on Monday. It is along a main road with no place to pull off so I took this through the windshield. The cactus itself is made of concrete and surrounded by a landscaped flowerbed made of stone. Even without enlarging the photo you can probably see it is outlined with large Christmas bulbs. We have never been past it in the dark but I imagine it is something to see. Should you happen to go ahead and enlarge the photo you can see that on one side it is bordered with a chainlink fence that surrounds a cemetery. For more Yard Art join Mary here .
The world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that Olivier Dupon from Dossier37 is one of them. He is known to many Sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop Lola Et Moi, which he ran&nbsp;for about three years,&nbsp;and now the rest of the world is getting to know&nbsp;his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog&nbsp; Dossier37 . Olivier kindly shared these pics with Daily Imprint of his home in Pyrmont. As he describes it, "Great views, great light... We use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks&nbsp;and designer pieces." Which five words best describe you? Perseverance, reliability, compassion, flair, hard work. What was your first job and what path have you taken since then? I worked for Christian Dior as a production assistant (in the ready-to-wear department). This led to another contract as senior production assistant. From then, I expanded my experience by working for the extreme opposite of luxury fashion, that is mass market fashion. I spent about 6 years as a fashion buyer for a big French retailer. I then moved to London for&nbsp;4 years as a product manager for a fashion house. I then relocated to Australia, and this big move was a trigger for my current career. I decided to open my own shop [Lola Et Moi] and to work closely with independent designers. Back to the hand-made, unique and creative scene, which is my true passion . What’s your proudest career achievement? Opening a successful shop on my own, out of no experience in this particular field, in a foreign country. What’s been your best decision? Pursuing the person, who has now been making me happy for the past 6 years. Who inspires you? Whistleblowers and scientists (not the sceptic ones). What are you passionate about? Common sense, environmental issues and creativity. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt? Patience is a virtue. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Any billionaire that has no idea how he can make a positive difference in this world. What dream do you still want to fulfil? I will have to get back to you in 5 years' time for that one. What are you reading? La Délicatesse by David Foenkinos. A french fiction novel (a quirky love story) and probably one of the best books I have read. images courtesy of dossier37 There are some stores that I enjoy visiting just for a pick-me-up. One of these is the Fleur Wood shops in Paddington and The Strand. Instantly I'm transplanted to a world where beauty reigns supreme and femininity is the order of the day. Not only do I covet everything I see, but the decor is sublime. Meet the ever-so stylish woman behind the designs. Which five words best describe you? Busy, sometimes cranky, and always trying to look at bright side. (sorry more than five words). How did you get your start in fashion and what path have you taken since? &nbsp;I started out as a VM and on the retail floor selling, I never really intended on being a fashion designer. What advice would you give to aspiring designers? Don't! Just kidding. Work hard and don't worry about what every body else is doing. What's your proudest career achievement? I am always delighted when I&nbsp;&nbsp;see someone walking down the street in one of my designs. What has been your best decision? To listen to people with more&nbsp;&nbsp;experience and take good advise when offered. Who inspires you? My husband. What are you passionate about? Human rights. Which person, living or&nbsp;dead, would you most like to meet? Mary Magdeline. What dream do you&nbsp;still want to fulfil? World peace. What are you reading? The beautiful fall , by Alicia Drake. The story of&nbsp;the friendship of Karl Lagerfield and Yves Saint Laurent. images courtesy of fleur wood You might have seen Stephen Ormandy 's artworks on a recent cover of Vogue Living - his home with fellow Dinosaur Design 's founder Louise Olsen was featured inside. Or you might have seen his recent exhibition at the Tim Olsen Gallery - I still have the flyer pinned to my board at work (he used the most beautiful yellow, grey and blue combinations). Alternatively, you might just know him as part of the triumvirate - Liane Rossler is the third partner - that established Dinosaur Designs. Which five words best describe you? Lover, optimist, enthusiast, dedicated, inquisitive. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? I have never worked for anyone but myself and don't consider working at Dinosaur Designs or painting as a job, It feels more like living a creative life. I first dreamed about being a painter in kindergarten, which is all about play and creativity, how much fun is that, no wonder I was hooked early. What’s the best advice you’ve been given? Travel. What’s your proudest career achievement? A solo show at Tim Olsen Gallery. What has been your best decision? Applying to study at COFA. Who inspires you? Matisse, Picasso, William Scott, Victor Pasmore, Miro, Arp, Tapio Wirkkala, John Olsen, John Coburn, Dale Frank, Anish Kapoor, Urs Fischer, Wolfgang Laib..... What are you passionate about? Family. Painting. Designing. Surfing. Food. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Matisse. What dream do you still want to fulfil? I have so much to be thankful for already. What are you reading? The $12 million&nbsp;stuffed shark by Don Thompson. Glimmer by Warren Berger. images courtesy of stephen ormandy and tim olsen gallery It had been a while since I'd visited&nbsp; Davidmetnicole . But I knew they'd be a great place to get&nbsp;props and those special little touches that set off a shot for a recent shoot. After one failed mission there - closed for a refurbishment -&nbsp;I returned a few weeks later. Oh, what a cornucopia of rubber stamps they have! And not mass-produced ones from China. No, these were old-fashioned stamps used in&nbsp;offices when filing cabinets were made of wood and phone calls were made via&nbsp;a switchboard.&nbsp;Then I came across&nbsp;images of their home shot for Vogue Living, and realised that I actually have the photo&nbsp;of the flowers in a glass lantern tucked into my&nbsp;reference book. It seems David and Nicole have always held a special place in my heart. Which words best describe you? Eclectic, organised, disorganised. What was your first job and what path have you taken since? Difficult, never been big on a "career" did mainly whatever was interested in. Worked in everything from set design, through to horticulture and forestry, to retail. Loved them all, but retail is where my heart lies! What's the best lesson you've learnt? Double check everything, even if it sounds simple and everyone understands and it all looks fine, run through it again just to be sure. What's your proudest achievement? The store (davidmetnicole) it¹s our own company. Not working all hours for someone else's dream and that's always the best! What's been your best decision?&nbsp; To stop moving around, place to place, job to job etc and settle down. You can only truly achieve something once you stay in one spot for a while! Who inspires you? &nbsp;I must say the modern "man/humanity" does not often inspire me. The world is too caught up in making money, celebrity and the next big thing to be truly interesting . I always naturally seem to be inspired by past humanity in general and the amazing things that were achieved in a time before computers, the internet, the highly mechanised world we live in today! These people were truly amazing and we owe them a lot. What are you passionate about? Well made (anything) very rare now. The throw away society is destroying our planet and it's for all of us to step up, demand quality products that last and can be repaired and importantly ...be prepared to pay for them. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Listening and talking to my Great Great Nana. I was too young to properly have a conversation with her while she was alive and she lived through the most interesting period in human history from late Victorian through to the 60s. She died in the early nighties. She was one of Queen Victoria's official knitters and knitted all of the Queen's&nbsp;tea-cosies and met her several times. She survived a Zeplin attack in London during the First World War, and was an air field medic serving with a hurricane squad during the Second World War... amazing! What are you reading?&nbsp; Brave new world. shop images davidmetnicole and others&nbsp;via moodboard I never EVER thought I would ever do anything crafty. You see, I'm the girl who had to get a boy to finish my sewing project at school because I was doing such a terrible job. Me and sewing machines just didn't mix... then. NOW, well it all seems a different story, but I still haven't actually used a machine. Just lots of cutting, stitching and fumbling my way through. But somehow I'm really getting into the vibe of making things. It really is much more satisfying than I ever thought possible. On the office shoot that I styled for the March issue of real living (on sale until Monday, when the next issue comes out) I went crazy in the "Crafty Industrial" space. Hope you like these little ideas that were shot on the day. images real living and chris warnes Just&nbsp;before the summer&nbsp;break I went to the book launch of The Crafty Minx . I always try to get along to these events because I'm fascinated to learn the process that goes into creating a book. It's also an interesting insight into what authors are actually like. I enjoyed&nbsp;hearing&nbsp;publisher Kay Scarlett speak about the "Minx" herself, Kelly Doust . She described the first time they met. Kelly was dressed in customised vintage clothes and looked divine. Right then Kay knew that this was no ordinary woman. Since then Kelly has gone on to not only publish her collection of craft projects but has also written a follow-up book The Crafty Kid , which will be published&nbsp;mid-year. And a memoir is in the works too. All this and Kelly is&nbsp;mum to an 18-month-old&nbsp;girl.&nbsp; Which five words best describe you? Creative, happy, passionate, hardworking and flawed. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? My first job out of university was in an investment bank, believe it or not. It made me realise how important it is to be surrounded by like-minded people every day you possibly can ... so I left. Shortly afterwards, I went on to study book editing and publishing before moving into the industry, and worked there up until recently as a book publicist. I also ventured into journalism, agency publicity and advertising along the way, but always kept coming back to books. Publishing folk are my kin. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Confucius said it first: find a job you'll love and you'll never work a day in your life . What’s your proudest career achievement? Having my first book published. What’s been your best decision? Leaving my job when I was five months' pregnant to work on the proposal for The Crafty Minx. I honestly haven't regretted it for a second, although those first few weeks were nerve-wracking . It took a while to get into the rhythm of working from home. Who inspires you? Barack Obama for his social conscience, passion and dignity, and my friend Maggie Hamilton - a social researcher and writer. What are you passionate about? My husband and daughter, friends, home, food, fashion, travel, and treading lightly upon this earth of ours... plus a whole list of other things too long to mention. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? I'm not much for meet and greets, but I'd very much like to have a decent conversation with Emily Dickinson about her poetry, which resonates still after so many years . What dream do you still want to fulfil? To write a good novel. What are you reading? I've just finished reading Sarah Waters' The Little Stranger, which I thought was gripping and masterfully told, and have AM Homes' This Book Will Save Your Life, a biography of Muriel Spark by Martin Stannard and a quirkly little book called Important Artifacts and Personal Property from the Collection of Lenore Doolan and Harold Morris by Leanne Shapton on the go. images courtesy of kelly doust It's always interesting what stands the test of time when it comes to design. Looking over images of Romaine Alwill 's styling&nbsp;from when she worked at Belle magazine, I'm impressed by how stunning and thoughtful the images are - still. Now, she's gone full circle and returned more to her area of study&nbsp;- interior architecture&nbsp;- with her company Alwill , a&nbsp;business she runs with her sister Nadine. Which five words best describe you? Ooh - this is hard... curious, motivated (or workaholic), energetic, easy going (I hope!), efficient. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? After graduating from&nbsp;university the first job I really enjoyed was as interior design editor at Belle magazine, which I did for&nbsp;five years. It exposed me to so many aspects of the industry. It wasn't a conventional role to take after studying interior architecture but it was creatively very satisfying . What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Trust your instincts and stand your ground. What’s your proudest career achievement? I feel like there is still so much to learn, so I hope that it is still ahead! What’s been your best decision? Starting my own business and having a family. There are challenges but they are worth it! Who inspires you? People who are open to allowing new creativity and ideas to flourish + fine craftsmen. What are you passionate about? Travelling and seeing other cultures. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Anastasia, daughter of the Tsar of Russia. I'm fascinated by that story. What dream do you still want to fulfil? To have "alwill" as a total lifestyle company. What are you reading? I just had a baby so there isn't much time for reading so I have a short book called The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennet. images courtesy of romaine alwill christina with her miniature poodle, walter Now, I know this is going to sound a little strange - but there are a lot of similarities between baby and pet products. Just because you adore your little one doesn't mean you want them bedecked in garish colours or cheap-quality merchandise. That's why Best in Park is already a huge hit with dog lovers. It's quality all the way, which is not surprising given the designer and brains behind the business is Christina Teresinski, who has learnt on the job&nbsp;with some of Australia's biggest and most well-loved brands. Which five words best describe you? Passionate, organised, engaging, sensitive and dog-loving! What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? After completing an arts degree at Melbourne University, I landed my dream marketing assistant job at Esprit. It was the heady, early nineties and the stores back then were designed by Ettore Sottsass, Shigeru Uchida &amp; Antonio Citterio . This led to some time at an advertising agency and then a marketing communications role at Country Road. The role presented some great opportunities . The beauty industry beckoned, and marketing combined with my love of the creative process led me to product development – more recently Mecca Cosmetica &amp; Kit. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Be true to your own vision and values, never be afraid to express yourself and surround yourself with inspiring, positive individuals . What’s your proudest career achievement? The opportunity to travel the world in various roles and to start Best in Park, which combines my&nbsp;experience with my love of dogs! Also, one of the highlights&nbsp;was my first international 'Best in Park' order from Atelier Abigail Ahern, an inspiration, who I know you have profiled on Daily Imprint! [Yes, LOVE her - read the interview here .] What’s been your best decision? Leaving the security and benefits of a demanding full-time career to re-group and start something for myself. Who inspires you? Individualists. My very clever &amp; understanding husband Sebastian, my mum and my free-thinking, creative friends. The inhabitants of my neighborhood (Fitzroy &amp; Collingwood). What a
e you passionate about? Embracing life, travelling to cities near and far, collecting experiences, culture, visual arts, loved ones &amp; my dog Walter and his friends (my muses). Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Artist Ricky Swallow , the late Sunday Reed , Sonia Rykiel and Valentino ’s five pugs (if only they could speak!) What dream do you still want to fulfill? Too many to list so here is a sample; to experience the northern lights in Norway, see dogs around the world wearing Best in Park, build a beach house, spend a year in New York … What are you reading? Seven Types of Ambiguity by Elliot Perlman, Flowing Like the River by Paulo Coelho (always on my bedside table), lifestyle blogs/e-zines and shelter publications from around the world &nbsp; images courtesy of best in park
The new addiction was... 1&nbsp;peeled grapefruit 1&nbsp;cucumber 2 apples 2 carrots 2 bunches parsley Juiced But now that I see this photo, the new addiction is officially... Learning&nbsp;how&nbsp;to focus this (old, but still new and unused)&nbsp;lens I never bothered (to learn how) to use.&nbsp; Why, oh why?&nbsp; Because I'm so&nbsp;afraid of such technology...until my default&nbsp;technology dies on me I see the colors. Oh my.&nbsp; The colors. Lovely Donkey reminds me to tell you (while he spies,&nbsp;so far away,&nbsp;from his field) that on Tuesday, I saw a special someone, who smiles as wide as I do. :o) This is the church... where masked bandits go. {To steal more food.} I'd like to introduce you to my masked bandits.&nbsp; They're siblings.&nbsp; In action. Moments before, they were standing&nbsp;very tall on tippy toe hind feet, poking their heads in my window and demanding food.&nbsp; I screamed. Then I told them to warn me next time, so I can&nbsp;make sure the correct lens is&nbsp;in the camera.&nbsp; {I like to document said thievery.} They said, "Hey, we're just sniffing out those amazing raw sunflower seed burgers you're fixin' up.&nbsp; Hand&nbsp;'em over, please.&nbsp; Now."&nbsp; {Those vegan burgers do&nbsp;rock.} Then I pulled out the camera. That's when they said, "Hey, that's not fair...some of you people shoot us with things like that."&nbsp; Which is true, and why you see them&nbsp;scurrying&nbsp;down&nbsp;to make some ruckus under the safety of the cabin. This is what happens when you don't have pets.&nbsp; Because when you have pets, the sweet baby raccoons don't give a hoot about the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;They just want to wrangle with the pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;And climb the house. But I live in a cabin.&nbsp; Without pets.&nbsp; So they try to wrangle with me, instead.&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp;they don't get fed. And I like it. {Let's just hope they keep coming back for more.} My brand new medical doctor is the best medical doctor in the whole entire world. And I don't say this lightly. Especially since I&nbsp;usually prefer a ND ( Naturopathic Physician ) as my primary care (insurance covered) physician. But due to circumstance, this is not an easy (insurance covered) option, on the island.&nbsp;Yet I'm a very, very, very&nbsp;lucky girl, anyway.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;(since I last saw my pediatrician, back in the seventies...or was that the eighties?),&nbsp;I've finally found my&nbsp; forever doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a long wait,&nbsp;sometimes, for a really good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;still&nbsp;wait patiently for&nbsp;local (insurance covered) ND care.&nbsp; After all, I need them both.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mom and a Dad. This is&nbsp;why I think&nbsp;my brand new medical doctor is the best medical doctor in the whole entire world (and of course, I know there are more of them out there!)... -He is&nbsp;genuinely kind. -He is genuinely welcoming. -He let's me know that&nbsp;he appreciates that I'm there. -He believes me. -He spends an hour with me. -He listens patiently, when I remember what I forgot to share. -He is&nbsp;kind in a way that tells me I needn't worry about how I talk (so much, but I still panic and try to fix this). -He is extra thankful for the really old (expensive) hospital test results I&nbsp;found...'cause they really help. -He draws diagrams to help me understand what he suspects might be going wrong now. -He wants to find out for sure...what's behind this. -He orders more blood testing, without hesitation, to&nbsp;check and see where we're at. -He orders more hospital testing, without hesitation, to check and see how things are functioning. -He asks me&nbsp;how I'd next like to proceed. -He is totally okay with the fact that I have no idea how I'd next like to proceed. -He lets me know that he'll handle things and get back to me, soon. -He tries not to notice the entire office saying what a kind, thoughtful and thorough doctor he is. -He works really, really, really&nbsp;hard and to make personal family time for his sweet loved ones, too. May all humans be blessed with such goodness. Forever and ever , Amen. It's Sunday.&nbsp; So I'm confessing. I'd like to think I'm doing this on my own accord, but a Blackhawk&nbsp;has been&nbsp;circling&nbsp;the cabin for hours now, so here we are.&nbsp; I'm giving up. February was not my month.&nbsp; I didn't realize it until yesterday.&nbsp; It didn't sink in until today. And boy, howdy, it's time for me to&nbsp;make some changes. First,&nbsp;I didn't see the need to worry about&nbsp;Valentine's Day this year.&nbsp; Because as much as I love learning about love, I&nbsp;never really worry about&nbsp;Valentine's Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think everyday is Valentine's Day. While recently&nbsp;discussing this&nbsp;thing called February and&nbsp;love,&nbsp;I had no idea I'd&nbsp;discover a month filled with my very own emotional triggers.&nbsp; Where should I begin?&nbsp; Oh, I know... Once upon a time,&nbsp;I was engaged.&nbsp; On Valentine's Day.&nbsp; (Sort of.) It wasn't really a surprise engagement and it wasn't really emotionally connective.&nbsp; Meaning...maybe you could say...it wasn't romantic.&nbsp; But slightly uncomfortable and embarrassing.&nbsp; Dutiful.&nbsp; Obligatory.&nbsp; The next expected step in that thing called relationship.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a&nbsp;decision that was jointly made, two weeks prior, while rings were browsed. And then I was married. But&nbsp;I didn't want to walk down that aisle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't want to be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't want to spend all that money or invite lots of people.&nbsp; I didn't want to be stared at.&nbsp; I really didn't want to do all those obligatory wedding things.&nbsp; At all. For a girly girl who's extra mushy about&nbsp;intimate connection&nbsp;and who loves to learn about love, this wedding experience baffled me. I didn't have the words to figure this situation out.&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided&nbsp;I must be experiencing&nbsp;what it feels like&nbsp;when you don't want&nbsp;the big wedding.&nbsp; When you're&nbsp;practical.&nbsp; When&nbsp;you don't want to&nbsp;be the center of the event.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I plugged along.&nbsp; I didn't really&nbsp;think I had a choice.&nbsp; (I thought I was a victim of circumstance...that it was my duty to&nbsp;be good and behave...and to entertain.) Then&nbsp;a&nbsp;confusing&nbsp;thought&nbsp;began to creep up inside of me.&nbsp; The thought...that I did not know...what I did not know. Profound.&nbsp; I did not know what I did not know. I was immediately lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was this stuff, anyway?&nbsp; That I supposedly did not know?&nbsp; How could I not know it?&nbsp; How could I find out what it was, if I didn't even know what it was?&nbsp; Why was&nbsp;such a&nbsp;revelation just then camping out&nbsp;on the tip of my tongue?&nbsp; At that pivotal &nbsp;time?&nbsp; Yet I&nbsp;couldn't even find it...to learn it...to know&nbsp;it...and ASAP!&nbsp; How did that happen?&nbsp; To me?!&nbsp; What should one do? How could I possibly hurry and figure&nbsp;it all&nbsp;out, before walking down the isle? Or is that what marriage&nbsp;is for?&nbsp; Figuring such stuff out?&nbsp; Together? A good therapist&nbsp;would have been a proper solution.&nbsp; Religious clergy would have helped, pronto, too. &nbsp;But I didn't know about the importance of&nbsp;such things back then.&nbsp; So I decided it must be anxiety.&nbsp; And that marrige was for figuring&nbsp;such&nbsp;stuff out,&nbsp;together...after the wedding. I was going with that theory, anyway.&nbsp; I really should have asked more questions. Wait.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I just didn't&nbsp;hear the answers that were right for me. (My fault.&nbsp; I thought I was supposed to support,&nbsp;believe and believe&nbsp;in another, no matter what.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;what worked for them was not right for me.) I thankfully mustered up the courage to leave.&nbsp; Years later.&nbsp; In February.&nbsp; Soon after Valentine's Day. Years after that, I still felt like&nbsp;a monkey was clinging to my back and I couldn't shake&nbsp;him off.&nbsp; As if I were still trapped. (And that was after lots of talking.&nbsp; About him.&nbsp; Had I&nbsp;gone straight to talking about me and my issues, things might have progressed more swifty.) There was another long-term&nbsp;relationship,&nbsp;where things appeared&nbsp;and felt very different, but where things&nbsp;turned&nbsp;out to be&nbsp;very much the same. &nbsp;(Don't worry, a good therapist can explain how this happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so tricky, let me tell you.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of February, a few years ago, was the last contact. Long(er) story short(er), February is a month&nbsp;that&nbsp;marks my&nbsp;freedom from&nbsp;things not good for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn't realize it until now.&nbsp; February is also a month which is supposed to be a symbol of&nbsp;love.&nbsp; Place these two&nbsp;together and one can feel confused.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;right on. The big little&nbsp;miracle:&nbsp; This February,&nbsp;I realize, is the very first February I don't&nbsp;feel&nbsp;trapped.&nbsp; Not by&nbsp;memories,&nbsp;feelings or&nbsp;experiences.&nbsp; I'm free.&nbsp; Those monkey's are off my back.&nbsp; Finally. And those changes I need to make?&nbsp; Starting tomorrow, March 1st,&nbsp;I'm solidly committing to these... 1)&nbsp; No more expectations.&nbsp; About anyone or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprises are much more fun. 2)&nbsp; No more waiting.&nbsp; For others to join in, to&nbsp;proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent progress is good for me. 3)&nbsp; No discussing others (keep it on&nbsp;the issues, not the people).&nbsp; If&nbsp;I feel pulled in,&nbsp;left or lost, it's time&nbsp;to let others&nbsp;be.&nbsp; No more victim in me. ( #3 is a bit military for me, as I've previously embraced the idea that we should&nbsp;have&nbsp;one private person&nbsp;in our life, with whom we can confidentially and safely&nbsp;discuss anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I've since learned that if that private&nbsp;confidant isn't a therapist or if they don't embrace "I" statements, confusion can occur.&nbsp; So I'm streamlining&nbsp;my focus.&nbsp; No discussing others.&nbsp;It'll be issues , instead.) This, for me,&nbsp;is about leaving February's foibles behind. This is about (re)dedicating myself to searching out&nbsp;those who share&nbsp;similar struggles and a similar will to learn, grow and evolve.&nbsp; Healthfully. This is about searching out those who look at you and feel good and strong about themselves, not uncomfortable. Not that any of us are perfect.&nbsp; People fail daily.&nbsp; Especially me. But if the mutual goal is to&nbsp;continually improve...that is where I'll now dutifully be. I'm march ing on.&nbsp; And you are always invited to join me. (Especially since I'll need all the&nbsp;help I can get.&nbsp; :o) We can taste. We can see. We can spend all day turning down an eternity with those we know are not meant to be. Ours. Privately. And then we somehow quickly forget. All of them. We&nbsp;instead fret. About that one special someone. Here or not yet here. Ready or not. And we blindly go forth. Lovingly. -ID ___________________________ Crazy Little Thing Called Love&nbsp; by Queen This thing called love.&nbsp; I just can't handle it.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I must get round to it.&nbsp; I ain't ready.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; This (this thing).&nbsp; Called love (called love).&nbsp; It cries (like a baby).&nbsp; In a cradle all night.&nbsp; It swings (ooh ooh).&nbsp; It jives (ooh ooh).&nbsp; It shakes all over like a jelly fish.&nbsp; I kinda like it.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; There goes my baby.&nbsp; She knows how to rock n roll.&nbsp; She drives me crazy.&nbsp; She gives me hot and cold fever.&nbsp; Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat.&nbsp; I gotta be cool.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Get hip.&nbsp; Get on my tracks.&nbsp; Take a back seat.&nbsp; Hitch-hike.&nbsp; And take a long ride on my motor bike.&nbsp; Until I'm ready.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I gotta be cool.&nbsp; Relax.&nbsp; Get hip.&nbsp; Get on my tracks.&nbsp; Take a back seat (ah hum).&nbsp; Hitch-hike (ah hum).&nbsp; And take a long ride on my motor bike.&nbsp; Until I'm ready (ready Freddie).&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I just can't handle it.&nbsp; This thing called love.&nbsp; I must get round to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain't ready (ooh) ooh ooh.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love.&nbsp; Crazy little thing called love, yeah yeah.

A quondam is probably a very difficult mathematical question which you ponder over for hours and still never find the answer, only to discover much later that you missed the point entirely and the answer was staring you in the face. Something like that anyway. Hopefully your invented meanings will carry slightly more weight. Invent away please. A purfle can be a fancy border. So, to purfle is to make something fancy. That's my version of what the dictionary says and it's close enough to the truth, so that's good enough for me. My daughter will be doing a bit of purfling before the school disco tonight, methinks. Well done to the inventors of interesting meanings for purfle. I have placed my favourite three on the poll for the voters to decide. Orotund describes a particular way of speaking which could be described by some as pompous and pretentious. Others may simply say the speaker was particularly dignified in their oratory. Thanks a million for your fabulous invented meanings for orotund. Today's fabulous winner was Bonnie. Great work Bonnie. Hope to see you here again soon. If I have read my dictionary correctly, to nuncupate is to make a declaration of your last will and testament through the spoken word rather than the written word. Presumably that's like when Auntie Nellie tells little Rita that she'll leave her collection of salt and pepper shakers to her when she dies. I really enjoyed coming back from my holiday to find lots of great meanings on the blog for nuncupate. You've all worked very hard while I was scoring cricket games in the sun. Well done to all of you. And a special congrats to Realityjunkie for a winning meaning on the poll. For those who enjoy figuring out the root meaning behind words, menology is related to month. But not in a menstrual way exactly. It's related to month in a calendar way. In fact, a menology is a calendar of the Greek Church which contains biographies of saints. That beats my invented meaning hands down. Thanks for your meanings and the long wait between words. Excuses, excuses, she said. I have none. Pure laziness is my only offering. Well done to new player on the blog (or old player with new name)- Metamatician - for a great win on the poll today. Hope you return soon. A lazaret is a special hospital for the diseased poor. Your meanings for lazaret were well thought out and interesting. Realityjunkie beat the opposition with her meaning. Well done, RJ. I had never heard of the word kickshaw until I found it in the dictionary yesterday. It's meaning could be useful though. My dictionary explains kickshaw as usually a derogatory term for a fancy cooked meal. Too fancy presumably. It then goes on to add the terms toy and trifle. I kind of get it. Your invented meanings were much easier to understand, clever and very enjoyable. Thanks for playing. And well done to silver_flight for a winning meaning on the poll today. Jussive refers to expressing a command. Nothing like as interesting as our invented meanings. Congrats to new player Ruby Rosamund for a first up win on the poll today. Great work Ruby! Keep it up. Sorry I haven't been on the blog daily, by the way. I'm doing my best to update as often as possible, and will try to be more frequent in future.
Suppose you want to buy a cart horse. Of course for most of us, this isn't likely but for a lot of people it is much like buying a used car. You need to look it over to see that there are no dings and scratches and then you need to see how well it accelerates and so on. But how to do that? At some of the horse fairs they tie a wheel of a cart to keep in from rolling and then ask the horse to move it quickly. Every so often I go to get some more dog food for the ridiculous number of dogs who live at my farm. As I sit in the jeep waiting for 10 bags of kibble to be carried to me I look at a shop right next door where they do something to cars, I believe. I've never seen them do it, but they have an interesting array of objects hanging over the sidewalk. I wonder what they are. This young man took me back to my childhood in a flash. The joys of dangling a hook and line into a body of water, no matter how faint the possibilities of catching a fish, had to be some of the greatest in the world. A week ago I was hosting a group of high school students at the farm and their bus managed to run off the dirt road into a ditch. My jeep isn't exactly big enough to drag even a small school bus back to the track, but happily my neighbours happened to have a bulldozer handy. They came over and very, very carefully lifted the bus back onto the road. What would we do without our neighbours? This is a lovely balady Arab mare with her sturdy mule son at her side. He's only two months old now so by the time he's weaned, he will know pretty much everything he needs to know about driving. The horse fair refreshment stand at the horse fair is a tiny bit spare. But it got lots of business from the buyers and sellers of horses, donkeys, and equipment get thirsty bargaining. While on a shopping trip with friends in Old Cairo we saw this man repairing folding chairs with new seats and backs. The sticks to his right are parts of garden umbrellas. Good repairs on things here are not very expensive and most people will repair rather than replace. A lot of work in Egypt is done in the street. There are some big garages that can repair cars inside but on Road 9 there is a well-known mechanic who works in the road outside a small shop containing parts. When business is slow, there's usually a place to sit.
Two LA Landmarks: Pacific Dining Car and Langer's Remember the 80s? We didn't walk; we power walked. We didn't eat breakfast or lunch. We had a power breakfast or a power lunch. And a suit wasn't a suit. That's right. It was a power suit. The whole thing made me want to power vomit. When a friend invited me for breakfast at the venerable Pacific Dining Car in downtown LA, my first thought was, "What should I wear?" I considered wearing a power suit (or at least a power jacket) while we ate our power breakfasts, but settled on a look that was more casual Friday than uptight Tuesday. After all, I figured the ultimate power comes from having a flexible schedule that allows you to take off the morning for a downtown breakfast outing. Sure enough, all of the other diners were dressed in suits and ties and gazed at spreadsheets and pie charts between sips of coffee from a china cup. To fit in, dining companion and I studied Jonathan Gold's list of 99 Things to Eat Before You Die while we developed a strategy for our next take over of a restaurant. I hadn't set foot in the Pacific Dining Car since the 80s, when I worked downtown as a briefcase-lugging corporate drone. I was happy to see that it hasn't changed a bit. Some icons become stodgy over time, but not the Pacific Dining Car. It still looks and feels fresh and elegant, refined and special with its rich colors, linen table cloths and fine china and silver. Butter rosettes and a fresh rose at every table I ordered the breakfast hash, which is made from the left over steaks from the night before. Unlike most hashes, which tend to be at least 50% potato, this one was 85% steak and 15% potato, all swimming in a rich, savory gravy. It came topped with a poached egg and two biscuits on the side. Power breakfast indeed. Dining companion went for the Cajun style eggs benedict, featuring sauteed mushrooms and a crab cake instead of Canadian bacon. After our two-hour breakfast, we realized that it was time for lunch. So we did what any food-loving duo would do: we traveled a few blocks away to Langer's to try one of their legendary pastrami sandwiches. When the sandwiches arrived, the first thing I noticed was the warm bread. Then when I bit into the sandwich, I immediately noticed the crisp, chewy crust. I was enraptured. Apparently, this is what rye bread is all about. Why doesn't everyone do it this way? We packed up our sandwiches to go, and I vowed that I wasn't ever going to eat again. That is until I returned home and that rye bread started calling my name. Of course, I did what any good girl from the 80s does. I powered down the pastrami sandwich and then I took a power nap. Be prepared for a 15-20 minute wait in line and a 15-20 minute wait for "fast" food at The Slaw Dogs. You may assume that you can get a realistic glimpse into my eating habits by reading this blog. You would be wrong. Or half wrong. Or maybe half right. Take the last nine scrumptious days. I've slurped Japanese udon and soba at Sanuki No Sato ; indulged in a friend's home-made cassoulet , ala The Art of French Cooking; sampled more than a half dozen "red wines under $10" at the same friend's home; toasted to good health with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot; shared paella, charcutterie, Spanish potatoes and a bottle of Spanish wine with friends at Three Drunken Goats ; met friends for dinner at Malbec , where my medium rare steak arrived well done (but the staff did an excellent job of correcting the overcook); had a tasteless burger at The Counter in Pasadena; sipped a Manhattan at the decades-old bar at Musso and Frank ; tried the jellied consomme (like gelatin with a bouillon cube), beef tongue, mixed salad and Welsh Rarebit at Musso's ; and couldn't get enough of the fusilli with fresh tomatoes (hangers on from the garden), shallots, garlic, olive oil, splash of balsamic and sea salt I made for dinner on Saturday night. And, even though this rundown sounds like a foodie's fantasy, it's far from my typical week of dining and drinking. And it omits a lot of indulgences, like the half sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies that I gobbled down in the car on the way back from the Scout's home. Or the Cherry Garcia ice cream that I had to have after a friend blogged about the joys of the cherry and chocolate confection . All but one of these meals was blog-worthy, but I'm not tempted to write about a single one of these dining adventures. And why not? Because I want to talk about hot dogs. The Slaw Dogs kicks the classic hot dog up a notch. Specifically, the dogs with attitude at Pasadena's newest specialty restaurant, The Slaw Dogs on North Lake Avenue. The hotdoggery has been open since February, and already lines are snaking out the door, an unusual sight in the City of Roses (especially north of the 210). Today, I chatted with two women who had driven all the way from Camarillo and Torrance to sample the dogs. While other eateries are tumbling faster than dominoes, what is there about The Slaw Dogs that's packing in the crowds from all over Southern California? It's an All-American classic. I know the saying is, "As American as Apple Pie," but we could just as easily substitute "hot dog" for "apple pie." Can you think of a hot dog without visions of family barbecues, fourth of July cookouts, greasy diners and baseball games. It's nostalgia wrapped in a bun. It's a Regional Favorite: Seems like every state puts a different twist on the classic. There's the Chicago-style hotdog. The Coney Island dominates the Northeast. And, of course, the restaurant's namesake, the slaw dog, is a West Virginia classic. The bloggers at West Virginia Hot Dog point out that nobody in West Virginia orders a "slaw dog" because it's a given that your hot dog will come with slaw. (Well, it's a given if you live in one of the southern counties in the state. West Virginians take "regional food" to a whole new level.) The Slaw Dog gives you the chance to order your dog just the way you like it, whether you're from Brooklyn, New York, or Charleston, West Virginia. It Was Ready for a Makeover: Like the humble grilled cheese sandwich, macaroni and cheese and hamburger, the hot dog was ready to benefit from all the best ingredients, including a selection of 11 links offered at The Slaw Dogs. It's Fun to Have Choices: In addition to the choice in links, The Slaw Dogs offers 25 "standard toppings" and 22 "custom toppings." It Lends Itself to Fusion: The Slaw Dogs offers a Thai Slaw Dog with chicken sausage, spicy peanut-cocunut satay dressing, cilantro-carrot slaw, crushed peanuts and siracha aioli. The Green Monster, which appears to be one of the most popular dogs offered, is topped with roasted green chilli (that runs the length of the dog), chipotle mayo, grilled onion, pepperjack, and spicy garlic salsa. For my first visit, I went with "The Original" with chilli, cheese, mustard, onions and cole slaw (but I asked them to hold the cheese). It came served with a knife and fork, but that's almost as much fun as slicing up your pizza before you eat it. Unfortunately, my grilled hot dog bun became unhinged after two bites, but that didn't stop me from using my hands to polish off the classic. Left: "The Original" slaw dog Right: The Green Monster, a crowd favorite How did it compare with the slaw dogs I've devoured in my home state? Unlike the fine shredded cabbage in West Virginia, the slaw is coarse shredded at The Slaw Dogs. And the WV buns are soft and steamy, not dry from the grill. On the other hand, the chilli and the grilled hot dog were superior at The Slaw Dogs. Country roads, take me home to the place I belong, Pasadena. But, next time, can ya' steam the bun?

I know. I know. Food guru Michael Pollan would not approve of eating ramen with a little packet of dried seasoning listing no fewer than 14 ingredients (including MSG). Just the same, legions of college students have escaped starvation and financial ruin by subsisting on the eight for a buck packages of Maruchan or Nissin Top Ramen noodles. My own finicky daughter started school with a hot meal in her belly, thanks to the Cup Noodles that she slurped every morning in the car for an entire year. (That, no doubt, qualifies me for the parenting hall of shame.) But me? The one with the discriminating taste buds? The one with the refined palate? No, I wouldn't stoop to slurping the ramen of starving students or the grab-it-and-go breakfast bunch. Thanks to the influence of my Japanese American neighbor, Carol, I suck down Myojo Chukazanmai ramen. At $1.49 a package, Myojo is the gourmet version of instant ramen. Last Saturday, I pondered the flavor choices on a pilgrimage to Mitsuwa Market in Torrance. I dropped a few packages of soy sauce and soy bean paste flavored ramen packages into my cart. And then came the WTF moment: Oriental flavor ramen. Why would a Japanese company with a Japanese audience market a vague "Oriental" flavor? To avoid confusion with the milder "Occidental" flavor? To evoke memories of a favorite Oriental rug? To appeal to foodies looking for a touch of the exotic? According to this review by NoodleSon, it's the sesame oil and traces of Chinese cabbage that contribute that taste of the Orient. Whatever you call it, instant ramen can be a bowl of comfort on a cold, wet day. But I'll bet that Michael Pollan still wouldn't call it food. I have a friend who truly exemplifies the word "gracious." When I recently threw a small birthday luncheon for her, she gushed repeatedly, "I can't believe all of the effort you made." Of course, she's the type who would be appreciative if I ordered Domino's pizza and mixed up a pitcher of instant tea. "I didn't go to that much effort," I protested, and I wasn't being modest. Here's proof that you can host a lazy luncheon and still make your guests feel pampered. Lazy Appetizer: The pesto torta , which we enjoyed al fresco with a couple bottles of bubbly, is pretty enough to look like you labored, but easy enough to assemble in less than five minutes. If you're feeling too lazy to slice your own baguette, have the bakery department at Von's Market do it for you. Lazy Table Setting: Use what you have. In my case, that meant backyard citrus for the center pieces and personalized grapefruit as the place setting. The gold napkins, purchased from Motif in Pasadena, pulled the look together. Not a Lazy Salad: This Winter Delight Salad is not exactly lazy, but the combination of slightly bitter arugula, sweet sliced pears, sour Granny Smith apples, sweet and salty candied pecans and pungent blue cheese is worth the effort. Lazier Option: Save time slicing fruit and candying pecans. Toss the greens with dried cranberries, slivered almonds and feta cheese. Still beautiful and delicious at a fraction of the effort. But, no matter how lazy you're feeling, please don't use a bottled dressing. Take two minutes and shake up your own balsamic vinaigrette - olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Lazy Entree: It doesn't get easier or more delicious than this. I called Euro Pane and ordered their vegetarian quiche with a potato crust. They even sliced the pie for me and threw in a half dozen crusty currant rolls. Lazier Option : Ask one of your guests to pick up the quiche for you. Lazy Dessert: Add some bling to your table with shimmering oranges and pomegranate seeds. Make it special with a splash of Galliano liquor. Lazier Option: While you're at Euro Pane , pick up some of Sumie's famous lemon bars. So, go ahead and take the kudos for a lovely luncheon. Only you and I know how easy (and lazy) it really was. I first sank my teeth into one of Brent's Deli's Reuben sandwiches about ten years ago. I loved it, but I never went back. After all, Brent's is on the other side of the universe in Northridge . (I think I regard the San Fernando Valley in the same way that many Westsiders view the San Gabriel Valley: a long way to drive for a non-destination.) And I figured that crowded and popular delis like Brent's would be around forever. In spite of my Reuben infatuation, I was in no hurry to return. But that was before my "restaurants might kick the bucket before we do" epiphany. So when my deli-loving friend suggested Brent's as a "half-way" location for a lunch meeting, I bit. I circled around the mini-mall parking lot five times before snagging a space. At 11:30 am, Brent's was already crowded. The bustling deli was filled with families: elderly mothers breaking rye bread with middle-aged sons; grandmothers, mothers and toddlers sharing a table and chocolate cake; doting dads spoon feeding cabbage soup to adoring daughters. Brent's, like a treasured family brisket recipe, is passed from generation to generation. And as I once again sunk my teeth into the Black Pastrami Reuben Sandwich, I could see why. The thick layers of succulent pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Russian dressing between grilled rye live up to the menu's promise: the sandwich melts in your mouth. I don't think I'll wait another ten years to return. Brent's Delicatessan and Restaurant 19565 Parthenia St. Northridge CA 91324 818.886.5679 Open daily 6am to 9pm Photo from http://oldschoolla.com Do you have a bucket list? A roster of things that you want to accomplish before you kick the bucket? If you're like me, food plays a big part on the ol' bucket list. There's just one problem with including restaurants on your list of things to do before you die: the restaurant might kick the bucket before you do. Just this week, two Los Angeles resaurant icons bit the dust. I've been to one, Goody's in San Gabriel, perhaps hundreds of times over the last 20 years. I always talked about but never made it to the second, Papadakis Taverna, the Greek restaurant in San Pedro. For years, Goody's was the location for my weekend Breakfast Club with a good friend. The waitresses weren't exactly mean, but they had no patience for special requests. (Half caf, half decaf coffee? Go to Starbuck's, Sweetie.) Well, maybe they were a little mean, but that was part of the charm. My friend Carol and I assumed that we would be eating pancakes and eggs at Goody's forever, or at least until we were as old as the other shriveled little old ladies who frequented the place. But, alas, Goody's served their last cup of bitter coffee last week. There's talk of a new location in El Monte, but it won't be the same without the f
miliar Googie architecture and crusty waitresses. Papadakis, the Greek restaurant that was as well known for its raucous dancing and breaking plates as its food, will serve its last meal and shatter its last plate on Sunday, February 1. Friends and I always talked about dancing and eating at Papadakis, but we never made it. Now I'm feeling a sense of urgency. What's on my food bucket list? This spring I plan to attend the annual Ramp Festival in Richwood, West Virginia, a daylong celebration of the pungent wild onion that is now a staple at high-end restaurants. How about you? Remember, we won't live forever and neither will even the most iconic restaurants. (For a list of 100 foods to try before you die, check out this just-published, SF-centric list from 7x7 SF. Scroll down for a look at Roadside Diner's pulled pork sandwich. I don't think I can live without this sandwich.) I was 21 when I made the decision to move from South Carolina to Southern California. Granted, it was a teaching contract that lured me out to the Golden State (and a snotty promise to my parents that I would move as far away from home as possible when I finished college). But I have to admit that I had been seduced by watching one too many episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies: swimming pools, movie stars. Throw in the beach and Disneyland, and I was hooked. More than two decades later, I'm now a little jaded at the sight of movie stars. Mickey and Minnie Mouse no longer do it for me. But there's one thing that reminds me that I'm living the golden life in the Golden State: citrus. And if citrus was gold, I'd be a wealthy lady. Our backyard trees are heavy with oranges, grapefruits, Meyer lemons and pomellos. I still can't get over the thrill of going to the back yard to pluck oranges for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. It took 12 oranges to make about 24 ounces of juice. Our grapefruit are a little sour, so I topped one with brown sugar and threw it under the broiler for 10 minutes. Get 'em while they're hot! Just let it cool before digging in. Nothing goes to waste. I use part of the peel to make orange zest and the remainder will go to our neighborhood goats. I'm making a Harvey Wallbanger cake with the rest of the fresh OJ and the orange zest. Of course, that means that I'll get to sip a Wallbanger cocktail while the bundt is in the oven (and before and after). Cheers to the good life in Southern California!
Bonjour à tous et bienvenue! Moi, gourmande ? Noooon franchement ? Bon ok j'avoue ! Vous trouverez ici toutes les recettes (enfin certaines) que j'ai soigneusement gardées depuis quelques années: recettes de famille, experimentations personnelles, recettes approuvées ... etc. Je suis sure que vous trouverez de quoi régaler vos papilles et épater vos amis ! Séverine .... Bon ... cela fait 2 mois que je n'ai pas mis de recettes .... mais c'était pour la bonne cause car je me suis inscrite à des cours de cuisine japonaise. Et comme je suis super sympa je vais partager avec vous les recettes que j'ai apprises dans les cours mais aussi d'autres recettes que j'ai prises à droite et à gauche. Cette recette par exemple, je l'ai prise d'un livre australien dédié à la cuisine japonaise. J'ai fait cette recette deux fois .. et a chaque fois cela a été un grand succès !! Ingrédients : - 300g de filet de boeuf coupé en environ 12 tranches fines. - 2 carottes moyennes (240 g) - 3 oignons frais - 6 queues d'asperges coupées en deux dans le sens de la longueur - 2 cuillères à soupe de maizena - 1 cuillère à soupe d'huile végétale - 1 cuillère à soupe de sucre - 60 mL de mirin. Le mirin se trouve dans les supermarchés asiatiques ...cela ressemble a une bouteille d'huile. En général la bouteille est assez chere .... mais elle vous durera longtemps ! - 2 cuillères à café de sake (le japonais, pas le super fort qu'on vous sert à la fin du repas dans les restaurants chinois) - 60 mL de sauce soja japonaise. Je vous recommande fortement la Kikkoman ... c'est vraiment la meilleure. Et faites bien attention de ne pas prendre une sauce soja d un autre pays car la saveur est totalement differente! Instructions: - Pelez les carottes et à l'aide de l'éplucheur faites des bandes fines de carottes (env. 1.5 cm de largeur ...enfin cela dépend de votre carotte :-P). Coupez les bandes de carottes de façon à ce qu'elles soient de la même longueur que les tranches de boeuf. - Dans un bol resistant à la chaleur, mettre les asperges coupées et couvrir avec de l'eau bouillante. Laissez reposer 2 min puis rincez sous l'eau froide. - Coupez les asperges et les oignons&nbsp; de façon à ce qu'ils soient de la même largueur que les tranches de boeuf. (Si ca dépasse un peu ce n'est pas très grave ;-) ) - Etalez les tranches de boeuf et saupoudrez d' 1 cuillère à soupe de maizena. - Mettre sur chaque tranche (coté maizena): 2 morceaux de carottes, 2 morceaux d'oignon, 1 morceau d'asperge. - Roulez les filets et sécurisez avec un cure dent. - Saupoudrez les rouleaux de maizena. - Dans une poêle anti-adhérente, chauffez l'huile à feu moyen. - Ajoutez les rouleaux et les faire cuire jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient légèrement dorés de tous les cotés. - Retirez les rouleaux et enlevez l'huile de la poêle en utilisant du papier absorbant. - Remettre la poêle sur le feu. Ajoutez le sucre, le saké, le mirin et la sauce soja et cuire jusqu'à ébullition. - Baissez le feu et ajoutez les rouleaux. Mijotez en retournant les rouleaux régulièrement jusqu'à ce que la viande soit cuite. - Si vous voulez une sauce plus épaisse, retirez les rouleaux et faites réduire la sauce. - Laissez reposer les rouleaux 2 minutes puis retirez les cure dents et coupez chaque rouleaux en deux. - Servir avec la sauce. Le Saviez-Vous?&nbsp; Vous pouvez trouver dans les supermarchés asiatiques de fines tranches de boeuf vendues sous le nom de "yakiniku" ou "sukiyaki" .... elles sont souvent surgelées et très pratiques pour cette recette !! Voici un recette de flautas vertes au poulet très facile à réaliser. Attention la salsa verde est très picante donc pas trop conseillée pour les enfants ! Ingrédients: (pour environ 10 flautas) - 2 blancs de poulet (env. 450 - 500g) - 2 cubes de bouillon de poulet - 10 tortillas - 1 ou 2 avocats mûr - De la "salsa verde" que vous trouverez dans les épiceries proposant des produits d'amérique latine - Lait - Coriandre - Sel - Huile pour la friture Préparation de la sauce à l'avocat: - Coupez les avocats en deux puis retirez les noyaux (en "plantant" un couteau dans le noyau, vous devriez pouvoir le sortir facilement si vos avocats sont assez murs...) - Retirez la chair de l'avocat et mettez la dans un mixeur (ou dans un saladier si vous n'avez pas de mixeur). - Ajoutez de la coriandre (quantité suivant votre goût), un peu de lait et du sel. - Mixez (ou écrasez avec une fourchette) entièrement, il ne doit pas rester de morceaux d'avocat. - Ajouter si besoin du lait. Vous devez obtenir une sauce crémeuse mais pas liquide! - Rectifiez l'assaisonnement. Préparation des flautas: - Mettre une assez grande quantité d'eau à bouillir dans une casserole avec les 2 cubes de poulet. - Ajoutez les blancs de poulet et laissez cuire 20-30 min - Une fois les blancs de poulet cuits, sortez les de la casserole et posez les sur une plaque à découper. - En utilisant 2 fourchettes, "déchirez" les blancs de poulet en filaments (voir photo). Encore une fois, cela devrait se détacher assez facilement si 1/ vos blancs sont assez cuits 2/vous déchirez dans le sens de la fibre. - Déposez une tortilla sur votre plan de travail et mettez un peu de poulet sur toute la longueur. - Roulez la flauta en prenant soin de bien serrer et de rabattre les cotés au fur et à mesure que vous enroulez. - Sécurisez à l'aide de cure dents. Vous devriez pouvoir mettre deux flauta sur un seul cure dent. - Repétez l'opération "enroulage" jusqu'à épuisement du poulet. - Mettre de l'huile a chauffer (environ 1 cm) dans une poêle assez large. - Faites frire les flautas jusqu'à que les deux cotés soient bien dorés. - Retirez et mettre sur du papier absorbant quelques minutes Pour servir: - Mettre 4 flautas (pour les gros apétits) dans un assiette sans oublier de retirer les cure dents ! - Badigeonner à volonté de sauce à l'avocat et de salsa verde !!! La douceur de l'avocat va contrebalancé le piment de la salsa verde. Ne pas hésitez sur les quantité faut vraiment que les flauras baignent dans la sauce !! Voilà, bon apétit !!! J'espère que cette recette vous plaira ! Le Saviez-Vous ? La salsa verde est une sauce mexicaine faite à partir de "tomatillos", de piments, de coriandre et de citron. Bien que les tomatillos ressemblent à des tomates vertes, ce ne sont pas des tomates cueillies avant maturité mais une variété de physalis. Cela fait maintenant très longtemps que je n'ai pas ajouté de recettes à me petit blog :( Enfin j avais l'intention de faire un vrai site ... mais au final je n'ai rien fait ... même si cette idée est toujours dans mon esprit, je sais que je ne pourrai pas le faire dans le court terme, j'ai donc juste décidé de reprendre mon blog. Pour cela, je vous propose une petite recette d´épaule d'agneau que j'ai essayé ce weekend. Malheureusement, je n'ai pas pris de photos ..... J'étais bien trop pressée de le manger :-P .. ah la la .. la gourmandise ... ca joue des tours. Mais bon tant pis, cela veut dire qu'il faudra que je le refasse pour ensuite vous mettre une jolie photo :) Ou si vous le souhaitez, envoyez vos photos et je les mettrai sur le site ! Cette recette est super facile à faire. Elle demande cependant un très long temps de cuisson ... mais vous pourrez vous absenter pendant toute la durée de la cuisson. En effet, nous allons utiliser un four à température basse et recouvrir le plat d'aluminium ...donc rien ne risque de cramer en quelques secondes ! Allez c'est parti ! Ingrédients: - Une épaule d´agneau - Une tête d'ail - Une botte de romarin frais - Une botte de menthe fraiche - Des câpres au vinaigre (moi j adore ca donc j en ai mis pas mal (100g) ..mais vous faites a votre gout) - 1/2 L de bouillon de poulet - 1 cuillère à soupe de farine bien remplie - Un peu d'huile d'olive - Un peu de vinaigre ou vin rouge Préparation: - Préchauffez votre four au maximum (220 degres par ex) ..on baissera ensuite. - Sur une planche, placez l'épaule d'agneau et avec la pointe d'un couteau , entaillez la légèrement. Il faut faire plusieurs lignes sur la largeur tout le long de l'épaule d'agneau. - Salez et poivrez généreusement les deux cotés de l'épaule d'agneau. - Détachez toutes les gousses d'ails de la tête. Vous devez enlever la peau blanche de la tête d'ail mais vous n'avez pas besoin d'éplucher les gousses. - Dans un plat à four mettre les 3/4 des gousses au fond. - Prenez 3-4 branches de romarin, coupez les en 2/3 (ciseaux, mains ...) et placez les également au fond de votre plat. N'hésitez surtout pas sur les quantités de romarin, il en faut beaucoup. - Posez votre épaule d'agneau dessus et ajoutez dessus les gousses d'ail restantes et encore du romarin. - Mettez quelques filets d'huiles d'olives par dessus. - Couvrez votre plat avec de la feuille d'aluminium et fermez bien. - Et zouuuuu au four pendant 4h ! Baissez votre four a 160 degrés environ. Pendant toute la durée de cuisson, n'ouvrez pas votre four ... Votre épaule cuit bien gentillement sous l'alu et sera merveilleuse ! ... entre temps.. allez prendre un bain .. allez voir un film .. etc. Comme je l'ai dit plus haut la préparation est vraiment super facile et je suis sure que les plus nuls d'entre vous y arriveront .. c'est juste la cuisson qui est un peu longue. Donc au bout de 4h .... neu non, ce n'est pas encore tout à fait fini ;) Il faut maintenant faire la sauce .. mais la aussi ne vous inquiétez pas, c'est super simple. - Cisailler finement une grosse poignée de feuilles de menthe (juste les feuilles !!) et les câpres. Je vous conseille de faire ça quelques minutes avant la fin de la cuisson. - Sortez votre épaule du four. Normalement la viande devrait se détacher toute seule. La viande à ce stade doit avoir un aspect assez collant.... si si si je vous assure c'est délicieux, la viande est super fondante. Mettez aussi les gousses d'ail de coté et enlevez les branches de romarin du plat. - Enlevez l'excès d'huile du plat ... ne raclez pas il faut garder les "jus" de cuisson pour faire la sauce !!! - Mettre votre plat sur les plaques de cuissons (allumées sur feux moyen-fort) - Saupoudrez de farine et "grattez" un peu le fond pour détacher les jus de cuissons. - Ajoutez la menthe et câpres et continuez à touiller - Ajoutez le bouillon de poulet. - Faites bouillir jusqu'à ce que la sauce s'épaississe un peu. - Ajoutez une cuillère à soupe de vinaigre ou vin rouge. .... Et voiiiiilà votre sauce est prête.... mettez la dans un bol pour servir. Vous voyez ce n'était pas sorcier :) Pour servir donc, il faut la viande, la sauce ... et vous pouvez accompagner ça de quelques légumes tels que épinards (cuits simplement a l'eau) ou un mélange de patates + carottes en semi-purée (comprenez par là qu'il faut que ce soit écrasé mais sans que cela ressemble à un pot pour bébé :P) Bon appétit .. et envoyez moi vos photos ! Le Saviez-Vous ? Le romarin est excellent pour activer les fonctions digestives (notamment la vésicule biliaire) et a une action stimulante sur le système nerveux. Il est aussi utilisé depuis des siècles en parfumerie. Mmmm voici une petite recette sympa de truffes au chocolat. Parfait pour les fêtes de Noël. La première fois que je les ai faites toute ma famille les a adoré ! Cette semaine je les teste sur mes collègues de bureau ;-) Ingrédients pour environ 1 kg de truffes: - 190 g de sucre - 40 g de beurre demi sel - 260 g de crème fraiche liquide - 300 g de chocolat noir patissier (j'utilise toujours un chocolat noir à 64% de cacao) - 180 g de chocolat au lait - Cacao Van Houten Préparation: - Raper le chocolat noir et le chocolat au lait. Mettez le dans un bol résistant à la chaleur. - Faire fondre le beurre et chauffer la crème - En même temps, préparez un caramel avec le sucre et environ 2 cuillères à soupe d'eau. Surveillez bien votre caramel et éloignez les enfants! - Une fois votre caramel roux, versez dessus la crème, le beurre et mélangez bien. Attention !! La différence de température va créer des éclaboussures, éloignez vous le plus possible de la casserole. Par ailleurs, la crème va "monter" donc je vous conseille de prendre une casserole assez grande. - Versez la préparation chaude sur le chocolat. Remuez bien jusqu'à obtention du pâte lisse. Si vous avez bien râpé votre chocolat il fond très rapidement! - Tapissez un moule ou une plaque de papier sulfurisé et versez y la pâte. Faire reposer quelques heures au réfrigérateur le temps que cela durcisse. - Ensuite, coupez des petits carrés de pâte (2-3 cm), roulez les dans la paume de vos mains (oui, vous allez vous en mettre de partout !) puis roulez la truffe dans le cacao. - Conservez vos truffes dans un jolie boite ... de préférence au frigo car sinon elles ramolliront trop vite. Oui oui je sais ... ce n'est pas du tout diététique ... mais c'est tellement bon !! Le Saviez-Vous? Pour que le caramel reste liquide plus longtemps vous pouvez ajouter ½ cuiller à café de vinaigre ou un filet de citron pour 100 g de sucre. Encore une petite recette avec du thon.. mais cette fois ci, nous allons utiliser du thon en boite... c'est bien plus pratique! Ce soufflé est délicieux servi froid en entrée avec une petite salade :-) La recette m'a été transmise par ma marraine :-) Ingrédients: - 8 Oeufs (séparez blancs et jaunes) - 30 - 40 g de beurre ramolli - 3 boites de thon à l'huile (1 boite = 160g = 112g égoutté) - 2 poivrons rouges coupés en petits dés - 1 petite boite de concentré de tomates - Noix de muscade (option) - Sel et poivre Préparation : - Battre les jeunes d'oeufs dans un saladier - Ajoutez le beurre - Ajoutez les 3 boites de thon émiétté. Attention, il faut mettre une boite de thon entière (thon + huile) et égoutez les deux autres boites en gardant l'huile dans une tasse. - Ajoutez les poivrons et la boite de tomate concentrée. - Ajoutez de la noix de muscade si vous aimez ca, ainsi que le sel et le poivre. Le thon étant déjà salé faites attention à ne pas trop en mettre. - Mélangez bient le tout. - Montez les blancs en neige ferme (cela sera plus facile si les blancs sont à la température de la pièce et si vous ajoutez just une pincée de sel avant de les monter). Ajoutez ensuite les blancs montés à la préparation en mélangeant délicatement. - Si le mélange vous semble trop sec, ajoutez un peu d'huile des boites de thon que vous avez gardée. - Mettre le tout dans un moule huilé ou beurré et faire cuire au four thermosta 6 ou 7 ( 180 ou 210) au moins une 1/2 heure au bain marie. Le dessus doit être bien marron, pour verifier la cuisson piquer le soufflé avec un couteau. Voila, il ne reste plus qu'à laisser refroidir tout ca ! Le Saviez-Vous ? Le poivron est très faible en calorie (seulement 27 kcal au 100g !) et est une excellente source vitamines A et C. Le poivron est également appelé piment doux ou encore poivron d'Amérique. Donc, en résumé non seulement le poivron est bon pour votre santé mais en plus il met de la couleur dans votre assiette ! Voici une recette très facile à effectuer ! :-) La cuisson prolongée rend les aubergines fondantes :-) Ingrédients: - 4 Aubergines épluchés - 1 Gros oignon - Une tranche de lard - 1 cuillere à café de poudre de curry - Sel et huile Préparation: - Faire dégorger les aubergines coupées en rondelle dans du sel pendant environ 30 min.

Voila c'est prêt! Servez bien chaud. Vous pouvez utiliser ce curry en acompagnement avec du riz. Le Saviez-Vous ? Les premiers pays producteurs d'aubergine au niveau mondial sont la Chine, l'Inde et la Turquie. L'aubergine doit se choisir bien ferme avec une peau lisse et brillante. Prenez une aubergine d'une belle couleur violette. Cela fait un long moment que je n'ai pas posté de recettes :-( ... donc pour me rattraper, vous trouverez ci dessous la recette du thon à la catalane de Maman... et comme tout le monde le sait les recettes des mamans sont toujours les meilleures !

Everything in the green world here in DC is popping, snapping, opening, rising, jumping out of the ground, from the little casings that hold the tree blooms, from the tips of the branches. It is like a slo-mo explosion of color outside. This is the great crescendo of spring in the American midatlantic. Oh my. I find spring here, by turns, overwhelming, irritating, and unbelievably beautiful. Every year, including this year of course, spring blows me away. There are days when I dance in shamanic alignment with the colors and shapes, when I become more vivid, put on a deep shade of pink lipstick and extra mascara. Other days I just want to run away from it all, go north or head out west past the Rockies, to places less verdant and therefore more peaceful. My respiratory system reacts as if it has been attacked which is the very reason I went forth this morning to buy bucketsfull of allergy meds. This year I'm trying Zyrtec, a more virile 24 hour concoction than the Claritin I usually take. I'm diving into the big antihistamines this year because I have a feeling that after our cold, snowy winter, this spring is going to be extra powerful. Judging by the way everything seems to be blooming all at once, I'm thinking my prediction is spot on. Gird your loins, people. Spring has sprung! Across the bar at Founding Farmers. Oh the rain, it does not stop. We've had three or four days of steady, soft, warm rain. I am not complaining. Those of us who suffer from springtime allergies welcome rain. It gathers the pollen and brings it down to the ground, a Very Good Thing. The rain, along with the mild head cold I'm just recovering from, has provided an excuse to just sit around. I've been watching Carl Sagan videos (of which there are a zillion on the internet) almost obsessively. I am completely fascinated - not so much by the science he describes as by his point of view. Only thirty years ago, we Americans were still dramatically Europe-centric, human-as-supreme-species-centric. To a fault, we believed our culture to be the center of the world. It kind of blows me away, realizing how much of an effect revisionist history has had not only on the humanities, but on the sciences as well. Our Ptolemaic view of what western culture is/was, i.e. the center of the world, has completely changed during the last few decades. How did it happen? When did it happen? How was it that we were finally able to admit that there have been many great, complex and interesting cultures in the history of the world, that many species have great intelligence? When did we open our minds? Did the spirit of Copernicus whisper in our collective ears? What happened to change the paradigm? I have no clue. Do you? On the Metro train, a great common denominator of humanity. Only because I think Brian Cox is the coolest rock star physicist ever, and because he raves about it, I've been watching old episodes of Cosmos with Carl Sagan (on hulu.com). I am so enjoying it. Cosmos is an icon of its time, (as is all art as well as all science). Though Sagan was the grooviest of groovies, seen through the lens of the decades that have passed since the series was made, his point of view is quaint to my modern sensibility. He speaks repeatedly of the "dominating intelligence" of human beings, and disparages the idiocy of nuclear weapons, for instance. I'm not clear that anyone I know actually sees nuclear war as a real possibility anymore. It was so of that time. Also, since the 1970's when Cosmos was made, we've stopped thinking of ourselves as a dominating intelligence, at least within the realm of popular science shows. These days, in most science documentaries, we focus on global warming and the loss of so many species on earth. We endlessly blame ourselves for every damn thing. That's one reason I have come to dislike science museums. It's all about how bad we are these days, rather than about science. Such a gloomy way to look at the marvels of our reality, don't you think? (Not to excuse our wastefulness or mindlessness, should say.) One thing we have now that we didn't have then are incredible special effects. In the 1970's there was no such thing as the Hubbel telescope either, so we didn't have all the stunning pictures of stars and planets, in HD, to work with. I don't get BBC TV on the cable here in the house on Tennessee Avenue, so I'll have to wait until Brian Cox's The Seven Wonders of the Solar System finds its way onto the internet to see full episodes. I'm content in the meantime to walk down memory lane with Carl Sagan and his essentially psychedelic 1970's worldview of science. I wonder how Brian Cox will look thirty years from now? Hmmm... From wikipedia: A virus (from the Latin virus meaning toxin or poison) is a small infectious agent that can replicate only inside the cells of other organisms. Viruses infect all types of organisms, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea. There are millions of different types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and these minute structures are the most abundant type of biological entity. So there really is no contest, no point in even trying to fight it. When the nasty cold virus decides it's time to take a bite out of me, I might as well submit, right? Ahhhhh-choooo! But even as I engage in typical down-with-a-cold behaviors: you know, drinking tea and leaving a trail of crumpled kleenexes in my wake, I always wonder WHY? Why did I catch this cold? Did the ghosts get to me in some way I was unaware of? Was it the extra-dynamic acupuncture I had this week? Did some early season allergy thing kick it into gear? The WHY ME thought form is no doubt left over from my years on the west coast where I believe it's a cultural imperative to believe that all illness happens for a reason. (Here on the east coast, we don't believe in minor illness. At the first sign of a cold, we swallow some toxic, over the counter medicine and go back to work. End of story.) Maybe today, while it rains and the virus parties in my sinuses, I should get myself back into what I think of as the midwestern mindset, which is: when you get a cold, get in bed, watch movies, read magazines and sleep a lot. I love the midwestern sensibility. Ahhh ... common sense! Now excuse me while I blow my nose - again! No, this isn't the haunted house, just another beautiful Capitol Hill house. I wanted to take a picture of the haunted house, but as soon as I aimed my camera towards the window where I saw the ghost's face, my trusty camera switched itself off and refused to come back on ... until later, on the Metro train, on my way home. Even though I believe in all kinds of mysteries, incidents like this still surprise me. A minute later the woman who called me about the haunting mentioned that after she and her husband moved in, every one of the kitchen appliances died, one by one, one each day until the whole kitchen was kaput. The night that the last appliance broke down, she heard kitchen cabinets opening and closing all night long. Even her husband heard it, and he is not given to thinking about or believing in psychic phenomena. Poor guy. He is in for one crazy ride. Even after yesterday, I still maintain that the White House is the most haunted house I have ever encountered, but this house in Alexandria? A very close second. There is so much going on there, indoors and out, that it would take several blog posts to describe all the energy. Briefly, surrounding the house are the remains of a Civil War hospital, adjacent to a Civil War battlefield. On the other side of the house is a new housing development. Land spirits really hate housing developments. And now here she is, rebuilding the foundation of the house which is, itself, completely full of what appears to my inner eye to be a family of ghosts. There are several generations of ghosts there, some it seems, from the "old country" wherever that is, some who lived in the house. The energy is so strong that at one point, wandering around, I mentioned that I was very dizzy. The woman said, "I stay away from that corner." I found many areas of dizzy energy in the house which is laid out like a maze. I wonder who designed it. It's like an Escher house with stairs going up and down, landings everywhere. To get from one end of the house to the other involves following a tremendously circuitous route. Crazy. I can see why the movers were reluctant to go inside. Believe me, that house is haunted! So I didn't do anything but ring the Tibetan singing bowl in the dizzy corner. It never hurts to ring the bowl, especially at times when I have no idea where to start. For the time being, the residents of the house are content to sit with the energy. She said things had calmed down during the past week, so maybe the ghost family has welcomed her. When I got back to the Hill I took a very long walk, let the breeze and the light of the setting sun clear away all that energy. There are hauntings and there are hauntings. The place I visited yesterday? All I can say is Wow. Pennsylvania Avenue by the IMF, close to Founding Farmers, my very favorite restaurant in Washington. On my calendar for today is an appointment to go see about a haunting in Alexandria. I'm looking forward to the experience as I have a special affection for ghosts. They remind me of all the stoners I used to hang out with. What am I saying? They remind me of ME when I was a stoner, kind of fuzzy around the edges, unable to focus most of the time. Ghosts get disoriented, they lose track of time, can't quite remember, most of the time, that they're dead. Sometimes they remember their deaths and freak out for awhile - that's when they moan and shriek and groan. But five minutes later they've forgotten all about it again. I swear ghosts are so stoned! They don't really get the living, either. I'm pretty sure they can't tell the difference between when we're awake and asleep, which is why they're always trying to talk to us while we're sleeping. We're quiet, not rushing around, when we're asleep. We switch off the lights, tv, computers, ipods, etc. when we sleep. I think they feel we are more approachable without all the noise and distraction. The people who called me about the haunting just bought a house that's registered with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It's close to a Civil War battlefield, but not right on top of it, which could be a factor in the haunting, though the woman who contacted me says she thinks it might be a female. Even the movers, burly dudes (as she described them) thought they saw someone looking out a window on the second floor. It won't surprise anyone who has known me for awhile that I plan to bring a small hand mirror with me today. I like to walk around haunted houses looking at a reflection of the space. Sometimes I can "see" things in the mirror I wouldn't notice if I was looking directly at them. I'll bring my Tibetan singing bowl and the purbha that Butternut Squash (of the blog Goddess of the Confluence) gave me. Sometimes the clear tone of the bowl is all a spirit needs to snap out of her dreamstate and move along. Sometimes it takes more than that. I also always take a rattle. Ghosts don't really like rattles, which is one reason it's traditional to give rattles to babies - to keep the ghosts away. But it does get them all stirred up, makes them more visible. It's a small annoyance I always apologize for. And my camera. Of course I'll take my camera. Though dubious that I'll capture the ghost digitally, it's always worth having the camera at the ready, just in case. The next time I complain about my life, I hope someone will remind me that actually my life is SO interesting! Yes? I say yes. While one of my housemates is in Spain, I'm in charge of walking his dog. I tend to walk the dogs anyway, whenever it suits me, but I'll admit that since Jake died, I've been a lot lazier than I used to be, sleeping in, reading blogs until 10 a.m. when I finally boost myself out the door. Tonka is a boisterous, energetic beast, much the way Jake was at the same age (five), so I'm up and out the door early every day, back out midday and once again in the evening. I am becoming reaquainted with the routes I used to take but abandoned after Jake, routes on which there's plenty of grass to provide inspiration, good smells, and easy to scoop locations. I keep seeing people I haven't seen since last summer, out with their dogs. Walking Tonka has provided access to dog society, synched my rhythms with those of many wonderful neighbors. When Jake died a whole culture disappeared before my very eyes. I'm a part of it again for the time being, which is so nice. I'm no longer grieving for Jake so it's not hard to explain to these people that no, Tonka is not my new dog. For a long time after Jake died, I choked up anytime anyone mentioned him. I'm asked every morning, after I explain about Tonka, when I'll get a new dog. All I can do is shrug my shoulders and say I don't know. I have no desire to get a new dog. Is that normal? Jake was the only dog I've ever had, perhaps ever will have. Who knows? One thing I'm re-learning is how much I love to walk around the neighborhood first thing in the morning when the day is fresh, the birds are singing and all seems peaceful and new. I'm grateful for this dog walking gig, I am. The weather has completely turned, and though I'm certain we will see more cold, raw, early spring days, winter is definitely done. Today Brother Sun will bring the thermometer up to 65 F. Ahhhh ... that's almost warm! Naturally I am feeling overambitious, as befits a sparkling early spring day. My to do list goes on and on. And on. According to the cosmology of Reya, springtime overambitiousness is a natural reaction to the upwards surging energy of spring. It is so strong today that I feel kind of superhero-ish. Where did I put my cape and funny mask? Where are my tights?? TODAY I WILL SAVE THE WORLD! Err ... or ... maybe not. But maybe I'll get the laundry done, the groceries purchased, and my room cleaned. Maybe the dogs will get a super-long walk, maybe I'll take some nice pictures, maybe I'll make a spinach salad after I meet my friend for a martini. It's probably enough, isn't it? I mean, if I'm only able to "save" my little corner of the world today? It's OK not to be a superhero, right? Yes? I say yes.

This one was made by Ismail's mother. The base is chicken breast to which all sorts of fresh vegetables like zucchini and potato are added. Then spices and olives.....yum. Cooked almost all day, very slowly. To be served with flat bread and salad. This tagine was made in our neighborhood and each tagine is a little different.

High on the cliff, there is a little cafe where you can watch the tide encroaching and retreating... and see the traditional fishing boats. The amazing blue &nbsp;is used on the boats and also many of the doors and window frames in this part of Morocco. I don't think it has a particular name but someone may well correct me. One of my favorite Atlantic beaches in the world. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } It's difficult to try to explain the house to anyone not familiar to Morocco. Unlike most houses in Europe and the US, there are few, if any, exterior windows --everything opens on to a courtyard. This is Mimi on the landing outside our bedroom by the fragrant jasmine bush. This is outside Robert's studio looking down into the courtyard. Pomegranates on the roof. The colors of the fruits are lovely against the traditional tiles. This is the little 'salon,' or sitting room, downstairs. The chair was made by a man on Derb Dabachi, the cushion covers up by the Mellah market. The rug is very old and from the Middle Atlas. It is hard to find black and white rugs --most often the rugs are much more brightly colored. The tiles are new since the old ones were quite worn out. The room is looking pretty neat, so Ghizlain must have tidied it up. There are no windows at all. Laundry in Morocco may be picturesque --see the photos by our daughter Claudia Schmid -- but it is also boring and time consuming. Since we don't have a washing machine I have a trusty blue bucket instead, and a wooden paddle to stir things with. I soak things in the bucket, scrub the grubby bits, rinse things a lot – since the water is so full of minerals it’s hard to get the scum out, then wring the wretched things by hand and carry them up two long flights of stairs. Dryers exist here, but most people, like us, merely haul everything up to the roof. To be honest, I don’t attempt loads of sheets – we take them to the laundry proper. Pegs seem to be considered rather a frill -- how much easier it is to just throw things on the wall, where everything, including blue jeans, dries almost at once. Of course, sometimes things float off into one's neighbor's courtyard and they may or may not reappear. All in all, washing machines are very good inventions. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Robert's studio on the second floor. You can see the very traditional, hand painted doors and the old tiles. The chair was made just a few hundred yards up the street. The painting on the wall is of people walking across Djemma Elfna. The railing goes round the courtyard and the little plant struggles in the heat. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } The light casts wonderful shadows on the wall of the blue-painted villa.

He will eat anything given the chance. His harness made up of all sorts of things. When I asked what the donkey's name was I was told just donkey --not Neddy or Fleur or anything - because he has a job rather than being a pet. Robert made a full size painting of a donkey we saw in Djemma Elfna. .flickr-photo { border: solid 2px #000000; }.flickr-yourcomment { }.flickr-frame { text-align: left; padding: 3px; }.flickr-caption { font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: 0px; } Fountain in Derb Djedid , originally uploaded by schmidwix2 . This little fountain in the courtyard is always decorated with flowers. The ivy climbs well and clings on to the tadelakt. Above the fountain is a Berber tent peg that Ira gave us.

Found these great mugs at Spitalfields Market.How many of you know about the pudding called Spotted Dick?  A steamed suet concoction with currants, generally served with custard.

Although London has the reputation of the city of grey skies, it isn't actually constantly grey. Sure there are grey days but equally there are blue skies, cloudy skies and magical sunsets.

I'm partial to March lion weather. The downpour has been nonstop, the winds are blustery and my toes are darn near frozen together but you can feel the seasons are changing nonetheless. Wore my scratchiest wool sweater today (knit it myself cause I can never find them scratchy enough) while I hunkered down in the shop and watched rain splash down the storefont for hours. Of course Saipua is a delicious slice of spring right now. Lilac, rex begonia, muscari, sweet pea, hellebores, snap dragons, hyacinth, parrot tulips, cherry blossoms. Even a rare canine cutest maximus complete with ivy garland. Appropriate only for a Red Hook rendition of A Midsummer Night's Dream , staring Nea. For those not in possession of feet that can easily walk to the Met on the first spring like day of the year, allow me to personally escort you via dreamland for the next 5 minutes. Playing with Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage really hit me hard. Grace suggested I go and I was completely entranced. I was that girl who devours every inch of written word on the walls and lingers too long with her nose pressed to each and every piece. Behavior which I tend to find s anctimonious in others but don't generally hesitate in doling out myself when the time is right. The show focused on a trend of the mid 19th century- aristocratic women painting vignettes and the pasting photographs of the disembodied heads of their friends and family into the scene. The resulting albums are wildly clever and now my conception of victorian stuffiness is totally skewed. Not to mention these rich ladies were charming painters, in and of themselves. Just another reason why I should have been to born to Victorian aristocracy. Instead, I got yoga doing hippie parents in 1984. Not complaining..... Only a little. Checking my mail always makes me a little anxious. I know that 96% of the time there's going to be nothing good, or even worse, nothing at all. I've been getting a lot of letters addressed to my ex-boyfriend and I that advertise buying joint funeral plots. Depressing on so many levels. And yet I watch my mailbox like a hawk. Every Sunday as I automatically reach for my mail key, my heart sinks a little bit when I realize there's not even the tiniest of hope that something wonderful will be waiting inside. Until something wonderful does turn up. Last week I got a mini surprise sent to Saipua from Christine , a darling kindred spirit who reads An Apple a Day. The envelope had 8 vintage stamps used as postage- in the accompanying letter she explained that each of the stamps was inspired by a post on the blog. Seriously. Some people are so thoughtful, sweet and kind. I'm left in shock, wondering how I've turned into such a self consumed maniac. The inside she stuffed full with beautiful old photos, an old pullman car ticket and more of the same beautiful unused stamps. I have an idea of who I'd like to send them off to, but I think I've lost my nerve. Best to bide my time till I can figure out a good home for them. Old stamps feel like little time capsules, almost too precious to use. Maybe I'm still in the puppy love stage, but I'm not ready to part with them. Especially the fox one, that one's all mine. I've been going as far as to call it my preciousssss , which is the highest compliment I can give to anything, living or otherwise. I am fully aware of the futility of saying things like "Sorry I've been an absent blogger lately" and "I swear I'll be better". Most of the time when I read things that that on other blogs, I'm not even aware that they've been posting any less than usual. As much as it pains me to say, a lack of posting generally means I'm happy and busy with, you know, things not involving a computer . My interest and commitment to internet has been waning. Real life can be so.... enticing? Distracting? Exhausting? Also, a few weeks back I found of that there is a certain subset of grown men who are obsessed with amputee girls (no matter how small the um.. loss ?). The swarming hive found me and it's sort of turned me off blogging for a bit. All's rectified, the point of entry had been taken down, but it still makes me feel a little uncomfortable. Talking about it makes it more bemusing/bizarre and less terrifying. Sorry Dad. Just needed to get that off my chest. We're on to blizzard number 2 in Brooklyn and I've been making soup like it's my job. I finally bought a shovel to dig out my car and I'd probably still be spinning my tires if I hadn't gotten a 20 minute coaching session from a older Russian man who, through my rolled down window, gave me his philosophy on driving in the snow. When a man with a beard and a Russian accent tells you about snow, you listen. My neighborhood is charming. Full of characters- hipsters and grandparents and tony soprano types. We all share one thing in common and one thing only. Vinyl siding. Sometime in the 1960s, everyone got together and decided to cover every house on every block with it. My house is 100 years old and it has it. So does everyone else's. But the snow makes even vinyl siding look delicious. It turns a neighborhood with a face only a mother could love into a John Hughes movie set, but with more cultural diversity and higher rents. Girls with snowflakes and pinks cheeks are helped out by boys wielding shovels. Snow gets pushed into mountains and I get an excuse to sit in bed on a Saturday night. Cynics will be cynics, but I refuse to stop loving the snow. About a month ago, my big sister and I drove 2 hours to Doylestown, Pa. to go to the Mercer Museum for the first time. We got stupidly lost after stopping at Terrain and pulled up 10 minutes after it closed. There may or may not have been tears, foot stamping and devastation all around. On my day off last week (shock! joy! I had a day off!) I made it back to the Mercer and finally got to poke around. It's a history museum devoted tools and products used in early American crafts, trades and occupations. Basketry, meat preservation, coopering, cheese making, leather working, spinning, lumbering, medicine, solar salt harvesting, glass blowing and 45 other unbelievable exhibits- each in its own small alcove. I was really overwhelmed. I've never been to a place like it and was basically floating on air for 2 hours. The museum isn't heated and we could see our breath while inside, otherwise I could have stayed weeks. Months. Years. All of eternity. Bury me inside the hearse and coffin exhibit on the 3rd floor, please. Valentines Day has been all consuming this year. Funny, my first year without a real valentine in, gag, 9 years and I've been up to my neck in beautiful flowers and chocolate and paper hearts made from 1870s wallpaper. Working in the love business will do that. It's actually been very sweet to help boys all over the city give flowers to the girls they love. Luckily I'm not the bitter type, so I've been thoroughly enjoying my small peaks into other's relationships, while secretly feeling relieved to be alone these days. That being said, I did receive my first ever box of beautiful chocolates from a nice boy to whom I'm not related. A chocolate cameo. I blushed. I'm always blushing a little bit, I think. The flowers at the shop this weekend were some of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. For all of my satisfaction with my situation, oh gosh... I did slip off into dreams of receiving some of the arrangements we sent out the door. Sweetest and simplest of all were the antique medicine bottles with a single stem and a rex begonia leaf, tied with a silk ribbon. Hoping your day was as full of beauty and love as mine- borrowed or otherwise. Here is undeniable proof from the 3rd grade, that, indeed, I've always been like this. It's poster sized. I think the hand drawn USA stamp is a nice touch. Dear Laura, I understand you have been very busy for the past 18 years since I first wrote. I was really sad I never heard back from you, but I've gotten over it. Just wanted to let you know what a big impact your books had on me as a child. I remember lying in bed and just reveling in the knowledge that a salted ham wouldn't rot. I also hoarded half and half's from 7-11, shaking them all the way to school and wondering why they never turned to butter. Thanks for that. Love, Amy Little known fact- when it comes to computer stuff, I work exclusively from bed. I have a big old 700 sq foot apartment all to myself, with an eat-in kitchen, living room, office and bedroom but I can't kick the bed habit. Decadent, yes? A week or two ago I got this pillow in the mail from Liane at enhabiten . It's made from an antique crazy quilt and its revolutionized my office . Even as I type this, I'm cozied up to that quilt and that pillow. This is where this (gestures frantically to your open internet browser) happens. You know, the magic and all that.

These last two weekends have been full of friends, laughter and general good times. First we had a long-awaited "Malteser" dinner here in Roch, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Last weekend, we spent a lovely couple of days in Reading for the wedding of my friend Kate and her now-husband Tony. We had an absolute blast - I haven't danced that much since my own wedding... and it was a bonus to have some cooperation on the part of my feet this time round!On the way back home, we stopped at Hampton Court and went for a leisurely walk by the river and revelled in the sunshine for a couple of hours. On another note, the job I mentioned a while back unfortunately didn't work out, so I am back home restarting the job hunt once again, but this time making certain to enjoy the free time I have as opposed to resenting it. Fellow blogger Allison over at In a Nutshell wrote these words yesterday, which perfectly sum up the way I feel right now:"Let this post serve as a simple reminder to myself to make the most of each day, and to be utterly thankful for the days that I have here under the sun and the stars. Let it serve as a simple reminder to bask in the beauty of this world and to let its warmth drench my soul."Next week, I'll be painting our bedroom! You know what that means, don't you? More random wall and paint pictures to come, lucky lucky you! *wink* accidentally,  Hello lovelies, spring is in the air! I can smell it, feel it, taste it - it's almost here!And to make things even better
A soccer team in England is using the Radiohead model of sales to boost attendance, and it's working.When Radiohead released their last album, they did it without any record label and they did it online, using a pay-what-you-want way of selling records.  It worked very well for them, and apparently it's working well for the English soccer team.Reds fans often use the "it's too expensive" excuse for not attending games, and often attendance is embarrassing.  I wonder if this pay-what-you-want model would work for teams that struggle to draw fans.  There are too many games to make it work all season, but maybe for select days?Then again, the "too expensive" excuse Cincinnatians use is just that - an excuse. It's not too expensive when you can take a family of four to the ballpark for less than $30 (that includes parking.) HAHAHAHAHAH. HAHAHAHAHA. AHAHHAHAHAHAAH!!!!Why am I laughing?  Because it's 65 degrees here and you're all buried under snow!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!I saw a little girl carrying a baseball bat and ball a couple of days ago.  The sight of it reminded me that it's almost time!  Now that the winter distraction that poses for a sporting event is over, focus will turn to baseball!March 5 will be the test run to see if I'll actually be able to watch the games, as it is the first televised Spring Training game.  Is the timezone in Arizona one or two hours different than in Florida? Ok, so it's tougher to update than I thought it would be.  I'm getting sucked into this city and baseball is the furthest thing from my mind right now.  Sorry.  Will update soon... Wow.  It makes the Cabrera deal ok, in my opinion.  Not great, but good, really.  Suddenly, I'm not so sure I should be saying I can't wait for 2011.  This is the same kind of stuff Jocketty did to make the Deadbirds win even when they didn't look so good on paper (aside from one glaring name.)This has been the best off season for the Reds in a long, long time.  It's about time we get something like this.This could be a fun year. Oh, that. Crap.__
What a great day it was today. Yes, I went riding. I was gonna meet some friends for breakfast this morning, but Mom seemed so depressed, I thought to ask her our for breakfast. We then went exploring in her car...I found a cool new road,right here in my home town. Less than a mile from my house, it went on for about 10 miles...twist's and rises...and lots of farm land. Mom perked up. I brought her home, and pulled my bike out. Put on my leathers, my scarves, sunglasses, light gloves...and went for a ride. I checked my gas tank, half full...odd...the odometer says 36 miles. Half a tank should read around 50 miles or a bit more...mmmm ah well...get gas later. I'm in the saddle and I stop at Sycamore Shoals for the encampment going on there. That encampment reflects the 1700's. I left the Fort and headed North. I found SR 400 and headed South for a time. As I twist and turn on this road, I decide to chase a small side road called Piney Flats Road. I've never been on this road, but it is a fine road. I twisted and turned through some wonderful little hamlets and loads of farm land. I was on the Quilt Trail for NE TN. I found a couple of great barns with quilt designs on them... Stopping to photograph them, I also discover this grist mill farmstead. Got some decent pictures... Left the Mill and started to head west on another undiscovered road. I've covered thirty miles now...and forgot to get gas. I realize from the miss I now feel in the engine, I'm running out of gas. I get myself turned around so I can coast downhill toward some buildings off to the North. I got a good enough run before the gas gave out, to get me down to this place. It was some long forgotten "salvage" yard. I called my brother, he came to my rescue with a gallon of gas. I passed the time by taking pictures of the salvage yard! (My reserve don't work, it hasn't worked since 2005.) Mark came with the gallon of gas and I'm ready to go once more. It's already time to go home. I continue to head North toward home. Stopping at Green Hill Cemetary to photograph the headstones there. Most have been there since the Civil War. I'm done...and going home...thanks for coming... I've read Saxon Motorcycles got some big young guy to ride one of their bikes around some planned portion of the country. I hear they filmed it...and showed it on one of the cable channels. I'm wondering, why they don't call me, ask little ole me (5'4") to ride their bike around the country shooting photos and meeting great people who love to ride. I would be a great spokes-person for Saxon...showing how short people, females and the over 50 crowd could easily ride their bikes on long distance rides...Man...I REALLY REALLY LIKE THE SAXON. I really like Saxon Motorcycles. Of all production bikes...these bikes are my favorite! Things like scour the internet to help satisfy my craving for adventure. Things like this help. WOW...the last part...ya gotta watch what these people do! My heart would be in my mouth! I've had it with fricken WINTER.&nbsp; I'm done with snow. I'm done with the damn rain.&nbsp; I'm done with the mud, with the frozen ground...THis sucks. My optimism has dried up.&nbsp; I've nothing to say about riding, except I miss it so much.&nbsp; I've made plans for future rides.&nbsp; And tonight, the Presidents State of Nation Address is going on.&nbsp; So nothing to watch on tv. &nbsp; I swear, I'm dyin here....if not for a challenge made by a friend I would wonder, what's the point?&nbsp; These past couple weeks, I've been taking pictures and posting my pictures to a new blog.&nbsp; It's a blog that posts one picture a day.&nbsp; I am challenged to get out daily and take pictures of mundane stuff...and make it interesting.&nbsp; So I'm gonna post a few of the pictures that didn't make it to my daily blog here, while we wait for better weather.&nbsp; Sorry it's not motorcycle related...I just can't keep up the cool thoughts anymore.&nbsp; I need a long ride. Don't you? My blog is called 365 Degrees, Photos From Each Day http://chessiesphotos.wordpress.com/ Took Shrek to the Vet's office today...the bird was there...and we also went to the doggie store... OK I've also gone and visited the Veterans Admin.&nbsp; It's many acres, with a National Cemetery where our soldiers are buried...&nbsp; I took a picture of a building that boasted this strange "gargoyle" kind of thing.... Don't ya just love this shot of Buffalo Mountain shrouded in clouds? Now this next shot is one that seems to be very popular on my photo blog. I call it "Stairway To Heaven". Now this next shot is of a spring of dried flower...or I guess it's actually weed. I like this one too...it's a piece of honeycomb sitting in a Mason Jar of golden Smoky Mountain Honey. Don't it look like... ohhh ...I could beg for some of this. This building is too cool. It's in Downtown Johnson City. There are more shots of this on my photo blog. All bright and damn nice... Now this isn't going into my photo blog, cuz I took these last year. But I love em so I guess I'll show them off to you. These came from one of my most memorable rides....GOD I WANT TO RIDE NOW The wolf and the masked bandit...cute guys.... This parrot allows me to dream of the Islands...What Islands? I DON'T CARE, JUST BE SURE THEY ARE TROPICAL (Singing) Hail, Hail...the gangs all here...what the hell do we care? What the hell do we care?... Well this is about all for now. Go Check out my photoblog... Harley-Davidson reps announce trike production will be moved from Lehman Trikes, based in Spearfish, S.D., to the Springettsbury Township plant in York County. "Our decision to move trike assembly is based purely on the restructuring of Harley Davidson's York operations, which now provides the opportunity for us to build trikes in house and streamline trike assembly and distribution," says Julie Chichlowski, director of Trike Platform at Harley-Davidson. Production of trikes at the Springettsbury Township plant starts this summer, when work on 2011 models begins. It's been reported on Fox 43 out of Harrisburg PA. that Harley is recruiting about 400 "casual" workers.&nbsp; This announcement was made on the 13th, while the announcement for the in house trike builds was widely reported on January 18th. &nbsp; Harley, rather than calling back and rehiring the hundreds of worker who have been laid off over the past 12 months, invited hand picked ex-workers to come back and interview for the "casual" work slots.&nbsp; The casual worker is not entitled to any employee benefits.&nbsp; So it's not going to be any secret how they are going to save money doing the job in house.&nbsp; The Casual worker will not be able to acquire 40 hours a week, but they will receive $16.75 an hour in compensation. &nbsp; I'm happy for Harley Davidson of York.&nbsp; Some of you maybe aware, I lived in&nbsp; Lancaster County PA for about ten years.&nbsp; I'm proud HD has found a way to stay in business and recall some of the laid off workers...even if only as casual part time workers.&nbsp; I believe the labor union may have something to say about this...depends on how smart HD was in the restructuring of the company. &nbsp; I have a feeling the Union will have a hard time getting their way...most unions are pretty ineffectual these days. It's too dang cold to ride....everyone is in the grip of an arctic blast. This has been going on now for what you guys?????? TWO WEEKS? Come on already! Time to get the heat blast burning...don't you agree? In the mean time, today I took Mom's car out, there is ice on the roads around here...so I took Mom to church...and then went in search of photographs. I really didn't go to far at first...here is Mom's church! I leave the church yard and head for the covered bridge once more. This time, I don't have anybody with me checking his watch...wanting to get back home to his comfies....this time...I'm to myself, and I love it! A couple of days ago...while doing things I sometimes do without my bike, I stop to take pictures of a chrome bumper grave yard. Or perhaps I guess these guys would like to think this is simply a "resting" place until someone in the country who is rehabing an old automobile...calls as says..."Do you have a front AND rear bumper for....???" Well yes my son, we here at Elizabethton Chome have anything you desire....as long as it's a chrome bumper.... I also have been to my favorite cheese section of the grocery store in town: And finally....a brutal ice scene. I've been wondering what to do here for a couple of weeks. I haven't been on any rides that made me want to get off the bike and shoot pictures. I haven't had a camera, or it's just to darn cold/wet/icy/crappy to do any riding. It's 17 degrees outside as I write this. It's almost 1PM. I don't have a heated garage, just a car port. I went outside a bit ago, thinking I wanted to see what it would take to start the old girl up. Forget it she told me. "ARE YOU FREAKING OUT OF YOUR MIND?" I think I should have wrapped her engine in an electric blanket...kept her jugs warm, her oil from turning to sludge, her gears from shrinking, compressing, and seizing up. I should have been more thoughtful toward the old girl. She is out in the elements alone, cold, and almost forgotten. Almost forgotten?I do think of her daily. I just don't baby her. I don't even put a battery tender on her, though perhaps if I did, I wouldn't have to remember to run out and start her on the warmer days here in North East Tennessee. But if I did that, then perhaps I should just put fuel stabilizer in her fuel tank, hook her up to the tender and forget about her till it really warms up, and the rest of the regions riders are out in force? No, I think not...I think my girl will continue to be ridden when possible. I think I will continue to rush out on days when the temps are above 32 degrees shoot some starting fluid into her lungs and crank her alive...push those fluids through her belly, into her heart, her crank case...warm up those piston and gears,move those flywheels around and around, push rods shootin oil into the heads, ...smell the exhaust, revel in her sound, her smell...in the way she always comes alive for me...pleasing me...bringing me smiles and good cheer. I don't do anything really in preparation for spring. To do so would be too much planning for me. The only planning I do in the winter, geared toward my warmer weather riding, is to open the atlas, and try to figure out a route to a major ride I am planning to take. I have good intentions. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortuitously...I often forsake the routes I've chosen for something that appears to promise a better adventure. As long as it takes me in the general direction of my original ending place...and the time is not going to be a large factor, I always tend to take roads I hadn't seen on the big map. Following the smaller State Roads, County Roads, or secondary highways that just didn't make themselves plain to me while I was sitting here at home....planning. Planning? No...I think I'm actually day dreaming...filling the holes in time until I can get back on the bike and be whole again. One thing I do need to do before I spend any time on the bike is buy a tire for the rear. Dang thing is dangerous. So that's it for today...I've rolled the bike out of the carport to take pictures...dang it...I'm so cold, my fingers hurt for a while afterwards... You all be well, stay warm, enjoy your lives...I'll dream of the desert of Mojave...and I'll crank my Little Girl up a couple times a month...ride her to build her cranking power up...and bring her home under the carport to await our next ride...short as they are. &nbsp; Hi everyone, What a year it was!&nbsp; Yes, I started this blog on Jan 10, 2009.&nbsp; No followers...but loads of thoughts, ideas, and my camera. You all know I love motorcycles, writing, and riding.&nbsp; Now it's photography that is catching my attention. It was recently brought to my attention the new decade won't start till next year... so I guess my actions in 2010 will be practice for the new decade.... So here it is folks, for you, I wish for you health better than last year, wealth enough to keep your smile on and the wolves away, but most of all, I wish all of you know and have the best of any love out there....
I guess that it is about time for me to write another post. Heaven knows there has been such an explosion from the last one that I haven't really had time to soak it all in. I cannot understand who or why anyone would choose me for this Google Blog of Note recognition. I have read so many beautiful ones with gorgeous pictures and art work and great discussions that I was very surprised. I think my age intrigued them as it did a lot of you. But I thank whoever the powers that be who did pick me. It has been a great ride.I'd like to give a warm welcome to all you newbies that have read my last post and some of you who have read further into my blog. Your comments have all been appreciated . I thought it was interesting that some of the first responses commented on the books and they each picked different ones! A lot of you share my love of Susan Boyle's story and many of you had read some of the books as well. Some expressed the wish that their mothers and fathers or grandparents would blog. I second that idea. It has been a great blessing to me. I shall try to get back with as many of you as I can. I am interested in reading your blogs as well.

[Editor's Note; If you would like to read writer Andrew Katsis' review of Ninotchka just click on the words... Target #282: Ninotchka (1939, Ernst Lubitsch) TSPDT placing: #282 Directed by: Ernst Lubitsch Written by: Melchior Lengyel (story), Charles Brackett (screenplay), Billy Wilder (screenplay), Walter Reisch (screenplay)Starring: Greta Garbo , Melvyn Douglas , Ina Claire , Bela Lugosi , Sig Ruman , Felix Bressart , Alexander Granach I find it a little odd that, on the cusp of WWII, Hollywood delivered a piece of anti-Communist propaganda, when clearly there were, at that time, more immediate threats to European freedom. Ninotchka (1939) was produced while Ernst Lubitsch waited for Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart to become available for The Shop Around the Corner (1940) , but it was by no means merely a fill-in project: the film was Greta Garbo's first and only collaboration with Lubitsch, and the actress' penultimate role before a premature retirement. [Editor's note; See Previous Post in order to read writer Andrew Katsis review of The Shop Around the Corner.] MGM's publicity campaign used the tagline " Garbo Laughs !" to advertise that this was a new type of role for the enigmatic actress, a comedy that promised to humanise her otherwise somber screen persona {this campaign deliberately referenced the tagline for Garbo's Anna Christie (1930), which had proclaimed "Garbo Talks!"}. Though the screenplay by Billy Wilder , Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch unsurprisingly has many genuine sparks of wit, the balance of romance, farce and political commentary never quite sits as comfortably as one would expect given the talents involved. When three Soviet diplomats ( Sig Ruman, Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach ) arrive in Paris to sell off some jewelry confiscated from the Grand Duchess ( Ina Claire ) during the Bolshevik Revolution, they find it difficult to keep their minds on their work. Far away from the cold, drab apartments of Moscow, the French capital is bustling with life, warmth and prosperity (just forget that the French upper-class are not, in fact, a reasonable yardstick for comparison with the Soviet proletariat). Playful aristocrat Léon ( Melvyn Douglas ), the Duchess' romantic lover, succeeds in corrupting the bumbling diplomats by flaunting the luxuries of capitalistic society. To ensure that the transaction goes through smoothly, the Soviets send down Ninotchka ( Garbo ), a curt, tight-lipped Bolshevik with a militant hatred of Capitalism and everything it stands for. Against all odds, the debonair playboy Léon and the belligerent Ninotchka fall for one another, an attraction that ultimately proves more significant than one's national allegiance. Unfortunately, once love softens the formerly stone-faced Ninotchka, the film shifts from being a lighthearted political farce {not unlike To Be or Not to Be (1942) or Wilder's One, Two, Three (1961) } to a weepy romance. Lubitsch followed Ninotchka with The Shop Around the Corner. What worked so well in the latter film, I thought, was that Lubitsch's heart was not necessarily with the star-crossed lovers – James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan – but with Frank Morgan's shop owner, and his familial relationship with its employees. The three reluctant Soviet diplomats in Ninotchka are utterly charming supporting characters, but too often they are shunned in favour of the central romance, which seems to tread water once, as advertised, Garbo breaks character and enjoys a hearty chuckle. Nevertheless, Melvyn Douglas is magnificently debonair, bringing something distinctly likable to the role of a lazy playboy aristocrat. During her opening act, you can almost see a smile forming beneath Garbo's icy exterior, and she plays the role with just the right amount of breeziness. 6.5/10 Currently my #11 film of 1939: 3) Only Angels Have Wings (Howard Hawks) 4) The Wizard Of Oz (Victor Fleming, Mervyn LeRoy, Richard Thorpe, King Vidor) 5) Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood) 6) The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (H.C.

Target #282: Ninotchka (1939, Ernst Lubitsch) [Editor's Note: Good Afternoon, readers I'am so very "happy" to welcome authors Eric Beetner to sit down with me this Afternoon (before he embark on his trip to China along with his wife to adopt their second child.) and I'am equally, happy to welcome author J.B. Kohl, who is joining us via over the telephone intercom due to the fact, that she lives on the east coast...] Well, let me begin our interview by saying... Good-Afternoon Eric, and Good-Afternoon J.B.Kohl, I know that you have been very busy promoting your book “One Too Many Blows to the Head.” That is why I ‘am so happy that you both have decided to join me this afternoon. First, let me start by asking you this question… DeeDee: Where Are You Both Originally From? Author Eric Beetner: I was born in Iowa but then quickly moved to California, back to Iowa, to one town Connecticut and then to another where I spent my “formative” years. I’ve also lived in Boston, NYC (briefly) and Los Angeles for the past 17 years. Author J.B.Kohl: I live in Virginia right now, but am originally from Nebraska. DeeDee:When And Why Did You Both Begin Writing? Author Eric Beetner: I started writing screenplays as a way to make a movie without the expense of making a movie. I went to film school so it has always been part of the plan to make movies and I was getting impatient. I like that when you write you are in control of the entire process. That control ends abruptly when you try to sell it but for that brief moment it is fantastic. I took to fiction writing after I burned out on scripts. I wrote my first novel in secret since everyone you meet is “working” on a novel but 90% never actually write one. I hate being that guy. I didn’t say it out loud to anyone until after I finished. Even now not all my friends really know I write. "One Too Many Blows To The Head" was a surprise to a lot of people. DeeDee: Wow, Unbelievable, But Believable! J.B. Kohl: I have always written, I guess, but I didn’t begin writing professionally until about three years ago. At that time, we moved to the east coast and I decided that, rather than find a new job, I’d just give writing a try. DeeDee:Hmmm...Very Interesting. DeeDee: When Did Both Of You First Consider Yourself Writers? Eric Beetner: In many ways I still don’t but I guess when I first got paid for screenwriting. For one script I got paid a paltry sum but when it was listed in Variety it said I got a six figure deal! I checked the contract wondering where my money was and the film would have had to make over 200 million dollars for me to make that much. Instead the film never even got made. DeeDee:(Laughter!...Wow, I'am so sorry to hear that the film was never made, but hang in there Eric... DeeDee: J.B... J.B.Kohl: Ooh. Tough question. I guess I still have to remind myself that I’m a writer. I’ve never really thought about it. My husband tells everyone his wife is a writer. I guess I say it but I don’t know when I started thinking of myself that way. I guess if I had to nail down a particular time I started thinking of myself as a writer I’d have to say it was after my first book was published. DeeDee: What Inspired You Both To Write Your First Book? Eric Beetner: Reading. Just loving the stuff I was reading and wanting to jump on that bandwagon. I make no pretense of reinventing the wheel or anything. I’m a genre writer and I am fine with that. J.B.Kohl: I had a character in my head that I had been carrying around for a few years. I wanted to write something based on that character . . . just to prove to myself that I could complete an entire novel. DeeDee:It Seems As If You Both Our On Your Way To Becoming Very Successful Writers. By The Way, What Books Are You Both Reading Now? Eric Beetner: Just finished The Fifth Grave written in 1941 and banned for over 40 years. Not bad. My to be read pile is over 40 books deep. I just cracked open Missy by Chris Hannan. I am taking a very long plane trip soon and I plan to bring 5 or 6 Hard Case crime books to knock out on the flights. J.B.Kohl: I’m reading two books right now: Why Shoot a Butler by Georgette Heyer and Midnight Fugue by Reginald Hill. DeeDee:The Books That You Both Are Reading Sounds Very Interesting. DeeDee: Who Are Your Favorite Authors And What Is It That Really Strikes You About Their Work? Eric Beetner: I am a huge Cornell Woolrich fan. The very definition of noir. I don’t have strong allegiance to many particular authors. I generally don’t read series so I don’t get caught up in reading 15 or 20 books about the same character. I LOVE Joe R. Lansdale. He may be my favorite of contemporary authors. Sunset &amp; Sawdust is amazing and packs so many damn ideas and interwoven plots into one volume that is thrilling to behold. I love anyone with a distinct voice like that. All his books are set in East Texas where he’s from and he knows the fabric of that country. It shows in everything he writes. I’ve been reading all of Marcus Sakey’s stuff, I like Jason Starr, Steve Brewer who I think more people should be aware of. Scott Smith only has two books but I love them both. I really love finding an old out of print book from the 40s or 50s and digging up a gem. That is the best! DeeDee: I Have To Agree With You Wholeheartedly, When It Comes To Author Cornell Woolrich, Being The Author That Defines All That Represent Or Defines What Film Noir Should Be... DeeDee: J.B.kohl, How About You... J.B.Kohl: Denis Lehane is one of my favorites. I like the understatement he uses in writing. I find it more powerful than overzealous descriptions of events. He’s really good. I like Agatha Christie. I love how she can keep a reader guessing until the end. I think Stephen King does some of the best character work around. I felt a little sad when I finished It, The Stand, The Talisman . . . because I had to say good-bye to the characters. I think that is a mark of a good writer . . . when a reader is sad to get to the end of a book. DeeDee: Ahh!...The Great Authors Denis Lehane, Agatha Christie and Stephen King... Ha!Ha!...I Knew It! J.B...I Just Needed A Writer To Confirm My Suspicion. Because I Too Am Reading Several Books, And I Don't Want To Part Company With The Characters In These Books Neither. DeeDee:What Books Have Most Influenced Your Life? Eric Beetner: My life? Probably I’d have to go back to The Phantom Toolbooth. It’s a young adult book, but it is so in love with words and language it really makes you appreciate words in a way few books for that age group do. DeeDee: Hmmm...Very Interesting! J.B.kohl: With regard to writing, there are two books I pull out over and over again: If You Want To Write by Brenda Ueland, and Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott. I read both of these books long before I began writing professionally and I still pull them out when I need to feel inspired or reassured. Being a writer is a lonely road at times and it is easy to become discouraged. I find if I need a little push in the right direction these books help with that. As far as books I’ve read that have influenced me with regard to the genre I work in; I’d have to say it was my early introduction to noir, The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett, The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler, the Perry Mason novels by Erle Stanley Gardner were among the top of the list. Early on I tried to get as many 1930’s books as I could. I’ve got one called The Door by Mary Robers Rinehart (1930) and I suppose I’ve read that three or four times in the last couple of years. I also have Motto for Murder by Merlda Mace (1943) and The Affair of the Fainting Butler by Clifford Knight (1943). I’ve read these over and over again. I don’t know how much they influence me, per se, but I find 
hey keep me in the right frame of mind when I’m working on a new project. DeeDee: Wow, Amazing! Who Designed The Cover(s) Of Your Book "One Too Many Blows To The Head? Author J.B.Kohl: A very talented man by the name of Marc Sasso did the cover for us. Eric tweaked it with the fonts and bylines. DeeDee: Eric, Do You Want To Expand A Little More On My Question? Eric Beetner: Oh! Yes, The amazing cover for our book was painted by a good friend of mine named Marc Sasso. He’s a professional illustrator and he did us a huge favor on this one. It’s not even really in his typical style but I gave him exactly what I wanted to keep it easy for him. I didn’t want him doing us a favor and then having to do a bunch of revisions. I sent him a reference photo and other ideas, he knocked it out in one attempt and then Jennifer and I collaborated on the layout, title fonts and back cover layout. We did all that stuff ourselves. People have really responded to it. We’ve gotten a lot of compliments. DeeDee: I Must Admit That The Cover Of Your Book Is Amazing...Very Talented Artist This...Marc Sasso. DeeDee: What Was The Hardest Part Of Writing Your Book? Eric Beetner: The hardest part was not being able to meet in person. Jennifer and I have never met face to face. It was a challenge in some cases but then I must say in others it was a good thing I think. We were really allowed to write distinct and different voices for these two characters. JB Kohl: The editing was by far the hardest part for me because it was so meticulous and so time consuming. Writing with Eric was fun and actually very easy. I was engrossed in the process a hundred percent from start to finish. DeeDee: How Did You Come Up With The Title? J.B.Kohl: We tossed around title names for awhile. Our first working title was Fist, but Eric came up with "One Too Many Blows To The Head." At first I wasn’t sure about it but over the course of a few days, it grew on me. Eric: Always much harder than you think. We had a few tentative titles. For most of it we used ‘Fist’. Then I remembered a song I love called "One Too Many Blows To The Head." It has nothing in common with the book but it sounds great and it just clicked. DeeDee: Do You Recall How Your Interest In Writing Originated? J.B.Kohl: I guess I’d call it more of a compulsion than an interest. I wrote my first unassigned story in the fourth grade. It was called “John, the First-Time Quarterback.” I used the word “whiskly” in that story, which is not actually a word. But my dad was so proud he still uses that word today. I guess I knew, even at that young age, if I could create adverbs, I could write novels. Eric: I recently found a pile of old schoolwork from the 5th 6th and 7th grade. In it was a story I wrote. It was a crime story with guns, loan sharking and a car chase. I guess I’ve always been into it, even before I knew what I was writing about. DeeDee: Do You Have To Travel Much Concerning Your Books? Eric: I wish! I have a standing invite to do a signing in Chicago but I can’t afford the time/money to fly out there. Doing a book tour is a luxury we don’t really have the resources for. Being on a small publisher doesn’t allow for a travel budget. J.B.Kohl: No, not at all. Not that I wouldn’t enjoy traveling, but it hasn’t proved to be necessary. There are numerous bookstores regionally where I am happy to do signings, but travel time for those events is negligible. DeeDee: Did You Both Learn Anything From Writing Your Book And What Was It? J.B.Kohl: I learned the fine art of collaboration, I think both Eric and I are a lot better at understanding the publishing process now. And I think we are both better editors and writers as a result of working together. Going into something like this, you never know quite what to expect. It could have turned out to be one of those situations where we write a chapter a year and in ten years we’re still talking about how we really need to finish that book. That wasn’t the case at all. I work very well as a collaborator. Would I work as well with someone other than Eric? I have no idea. And I really don’t know that I would want to try. Eric is too much fun to work with! Eric: I learned a ton about the craft of writing on this one. Much more than I did writing a book in solitude. I can say I am a much better writer after this process. DeeDee: Do you have any advice for other writers? J.B.Kohl: Keep at it. Write as often as you can. Encourage yourself. Have fun with it. We writers can tend to take ourselves too seriously. DeeDee: What About You Eric,... ...Knock it off. Just quit. More room for our book on the shelves. DeeDee:Laughter! DeeDee: Do You Have Anything Specific That You Want To Say To Your Readers? Eric: For anyone to find a book as small as ours and actually buy it is astounding to me. I firmly believe that if you like crime books or mysteries you will genuinely like this book. But for someone to make the effort to read about it, watch the trailer, read an interview like this and then make the next step and purchase it – I can only say thank you. I know I find it much more gratifying to discover a new writer. I don’t read anything on any best seller lists. I’m probably missing out but I just love the discovery so much it makes reading more satisfying for me. If our book ends up as one someone tells someone else about that would be the best outcome of all. I can make all my friends buy it but that’s not nearly as gratifying as strangers who feel no obligation. DeeDee: I Truly Understand What You Are Saying Eric,...J.B.Kohl, J.B.Kohl: I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it. I appreciate the noir novels of old and I wish there were more around. DeeDee: Do You Have A Specific Writing Style? J.B.Kohl: I have a bad habit of starting sentences with the word “and”. I’m working on that. I also write in incomplete sentences a lot of the time. I’ve learned that this upsets editors to some degree, which naturally makes me want to continue doing it, but I’m trying to break the habit. Eric: Every time I try to write something other than crime I find myself second guessing the over-earnestness or downright cheesiness of it so I give up. In screenwriting I didn’t have this problem. I wrote a little of everything. But I like building a reputation as a crime writer. The community is just amazing and to be invited in as an equal has been really gratifying. DeeDee: Do You See Writing As A Career? On The Other Hand, Is Writing Your Career? Eric: I have a day job. I can’t see writing becoming a full time job any time soon. That’s fine with me. My daily job is creative. I am a film/TV editor and producer (sometimes writer) and I do small film making projects on the side so I am very creatively fulfilled at work. I happen to get paid for it. I’m very lucky. I just hope to make a little noise in the writing world. If it becomes more – great. I’m not going to mortgage the house to chase the dream though. DeeDee: Wow, I Was Not Aware Of Your Day Job Eric,...It Sounds Very Interesting Too!...J.B.Kohl,... J.B.Kohl: I don’t see it as a career. I had a career. I didn’t enjoy it. I look as writing as something that I’m lucky enough to do full time. I wish it made me more money!! But I love doing it and I enjoy it. “Career” sounds too much like “job.” And I don’t view writing as a job. DeeDee: If You Had To Do It All Over Again, Would You Change Anything In Your Lastest Book? Eric: Not one bit. J.B.Kohl: I’m happy with the book. I suppose Fokoli would have liked to punch a few more people, but seriously, who wouldn’t? Sometimes you just gotta let things be the way they are. DeeDee: Ha! Ha! DeeDee: If You Had To Choose, Which Writer Would You Consider A Mentor? Eric: I am too solitary and anti-social. I don’t do writer’s groups. I hate classes. I abhor feedback from anyone really. So, in a sense, Jennifer is the closest I’ve had to a mentor. As I said my writing improved a great deal with this book and I thank her. J.B.Kohl: My dad is a great writer. He doesn’t write professionally, but he is a great writer. When I was growing up my two sisters, my dad, and I would sit around the table with a stack of blank printer paper. One of us would come up with a sentence and we’d all write it down. A timer would be set for ten minutes and we’d all continue our own stories from that one sentence. At the end of ten minutes, we’d read to each other. Most of the stuff we wrote was really funny. I learned the art of writing during those sessions – sentence flow, reading aloud, writing to entertain others. And my dad was the driving force behind all of that. My mother, too, is a great writer. She has a very subtle sense of humor that comes out on paper at times. She called me last week with a new book title . . . about flatulence. I laughed really hard. My mother is such a classy person and so sophisticated. So my parents are my mentors. I can say other “professional” writers have influence me, but it is my parents who made me what I am, who gave me the genetic material that hard-wired me for this kind of life, and who have always encouraged me. DeeDee: (Laughter! Ha! Ha!)...J.B. Kohl, That Is Funny! What Your Mother Said, About A New Book Title! DeeDee: Is There Anything You Find Particularly Challenging In Your Writing? J.B.kohl: The avoidance of procrastination. I find when I write on my own, it is very easy to become distracted by everything going on around me. Eric: I find writing incredibly fun and when it’s fun it is easy. If it’s not fun I stop. There are always more stories. If a story isn’t working or is a struggle I ditch it and start something new. I always want writing to be fun. DeeDee: Are There Any New Authors That Have Grasped Your Interest? J.B.Kohl: Oh, wow, there are so many great authors out there. I try to read as many authors by independent publishers as I can. Alan Draven, David Boyle, Thom Futrell, Nick Quantrill. In fact, Nick Quantrill has a new novel coming out in January. He writes a great crime novel. Eric: I have befriended a bunch of short fiction writers in the online community and there are some amazing authors out there poised for greatness. Keith Rawson, Paul D. Brazill, Jimmy Callaway, Jake Hinkson, Cameron Ashley, Jason Duke, Christopher Grant, Col Bury, Patricia Abbott,[Editor Note: Author Megan Abbott's Mother) Sandra Seamans, Libby Cudmore, Chad Eagleton, Cormac Brown, J.F. Juzwik, Robert Crisman...I could go on and surely missed more than a few but these are all people I have read multiple stories from and all are out there on the web. Webzines are the new pulps. DeeDee: Name One Entity That You Feel Supported You Outside Of Family Members. J.B.Kohl: Obviously Eric has been a huge support. If we didn’t support one another, we wouldn’t have been able to write "One Too Many Blows To The Head;" however, my writer’s group, The Gloucester Owls, is always instrumental in giving me great feedback on my writing. Eric: I have had great success among the webzines like A Twist of Noir, Darkest Before the Dawn, Thuglit, Pulp Pusher, Powder Burn Flash, Flash Fiction Offensive all of whom have published my work. Of course let’s not overlook Second Wind publishing who is putting the book out. We wouldn’t be talking if not for them. Lots of great crime titles there under the Dagger Books series. Next time you need a new book, look no further. DeeDee: Can You Share A Little Of Your Current Work With Us? J.B.Kohl: Sure, we plan to work together on a new novel. But we both continue with our solo projects. I’ve got a rough draft of The Deputy’s Widow done, but I hate it so I don’t know if it will ever see the light of day again. I’m also working on a sort of a horror novel, which isn’t my usual genre, so I’m having a lot of fun with that. Eric: I just finished the first draft of a new solo novel called The Devil Doesn’t Want Me. Now I just need to go back to the start and edit away, add, subtract and embellish. Then I try to get it published. In other words, you won’t be seeing it for a long time. I don’t want to divulge anything for fear of jinxing it. I told you, I don’t talk much about things until they’re done. DeeDee: (Smiling) Right you, are Eric,...Can you discuss or tell us your latest news? Eric: My news is that in a little more than a week my wife and I will travel to China to adopt our second daughter. It is seriously cutting into my writing time! DeeDee: Yes, I know, That Is Why I Truly Appreciate You And J.B.Kohl, Taking The Time Out Of Your Schedule To Sit Down And Talk With Me...By The Way, Congratulations And Good Luck! With The Adoption Of Your Second Child. What A Wonderful And Nice UnderTaking To Bring Your Sweet Innocent Children Into Your Lives. DeeDee: Finally, Other than promoting your new book “One Too Many Blows to the Head” What are your current projects? Eric: More words. More shorts, more novels. I have a series of short films I am prepping for early next year. I have a story in the Second Wind anthology "Murder on the Wind" and another one in a really interesting and exciting project called Harbinger -33 that is in the works. Both stories I really like. It will be nice to be in print in more than one place. DeeDee: Eric and Jennifer, I Want To Take This Time To Thank You Both For Taking The Time Out Of You Very Busy Schedule To Sit Down And Discuss Why You Write, Your Personal Lives, And Your Book ("One Too Many Blows To The Head") With Me. Thank-You, Very Much!...This Have Been A Fun Day! Eric Beetner: No, thank you. Toiling alone for months working on a book can get lonely and then to surface with a finished novel and have it out there in the world can be even more so if no one pays attention. Thanks to people like you for noticing our book and we certainly hope you find entertainment from it. DeeDee: Eric, I'am Quite Sure That I Will Enjoy Reading Your and J.B.Kohl's Book Very Much! Alone With The Current Winners Of My Book GiveAway Too! And They Are: Tony D'Ambra From Over There At... FilmsNoir.net CoffeeMessiah (C.M.) From Over There At...

Shipping Snafu...[EDITOR'S NOTE: Author Eric Beetner's Book signing was on November 14, 2009 at the... The Mystery Bookstore ... Author(s) Eric Beetner and J.B.Kohl Launch Party was on 11/14...at the Mystery Bookstore Location: 1036-C Broxton Avenue Los Angeles, California 90024 Phone: 310/209-0415 800/821-9017 Fax: 310/209-0436 ] COMING IN NOVEMBER , Authors:Book Signing Events: This Event Was On Saturday, November 14 at 2:00 p.m. AUTHOR ERIC BEETNER'S Shipping S nafu ... Of His Book "One Too Many Blows To The Head." So my first ever book signing was on Saturday. I was looking forward to this for a while. The good, no GREAT , folks at the Mystery Bookstore hosted me and I thank them deeply for inviting a newbie in to their hallowed stacks of books where I have seen so many giants of crime fiction read and sign.Small hitch...we had no books. There was a shipping snafu. Hard to get angry at Veterans Day but that one day of no mail deliveries apparently screwed us. So there I was with no books to sign and no books to sell. What to do? Solider on and do the event anyway! I read a section from my proof copy and people placed orders for books which I will then sign when books come in on Monday, only one shipping day late.Was I disappointed? Sure. These things happen. No sense looking back. Aside from being a little embarrassed it all went fine. People were very kind and very forgiving.Now to make lemons into lemonade! [Editor's Note: Check Out Eric Beetner's Delivering Copies of Their Book... "One Too Many Blows To The Head" ...On The Vimeo Video Below... I Think That Is So Nice!!!! ] When the books come in and I get the chance to sign them I will take as many as I can for those who are local and hand deliver the signed copies. You just don't get that kind of attention from the big time authors. If that's what it takes I am happy to do it. How cool would it be to deliver every single copy of the book myself and say thanks for giving it a try? I'd love it. I hope to capture a little bit of video of the deliveries and maybe post
Many cultures have used honey for medicinal purposes. Some use it as a healing paste for dealing with the pain of arthritis. Some oriental cultures use honey in their tea to help reduce the amount of bad cholesterol. Some believe in its ability to soothe sore throats and treat common head colds, and others that it can help with upset stomachs, indigestion, and even gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. There is also evidence that honey has cleansing properties to keep the human body healthy and in tip-top working order all year round.
This is an exceptionally great monitor. It has the menu button conveniently located on the side and the software that comes with it lets you control the way you view things. This is my first flat panel and I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a great monitor.

This was an awesome show that I was turned on to a little late.  I did not start watching until the 3rd season and was immediately hooked.  Awesome show that shows what it really is like to grow up in the streets of Baltimore, shady politicians, and corrupt officers.  It also show the good and the people who really try to make a difference despite the obstacles.
And so I take a deep breath, listen to the music from my headphones, listen to the afternoon Golden Roast religious debate happening in front of me, feel my fingers familiarly tap tapping on my keys, my keys, and smile sweetly. Smile, because I know that I am writing. Am writing, here, for this first entry of hopefully many. Am writing a school paper, for Islam, just the second of three.
One of my favorites from my garden this year are the Hyacinth Bean Vines that I planted from beans that I got from my sister who lives in the western part of NC. I was not even sure they would grow here closer to the coast...but it's beautiful and the butterflies love the blossoms.
I don’t have any concrete ideas or plot ideas for this new story other than the characters, what they’re like and personalities. I do have things that I want to happen in the story but I haven’t a clue how they happen or who/what causes them. I know I want an evil dictator, a school of magic, and an epic show down at some point (probably near the end). I want this story to have some crazy plot twist that completely change everything in the story and confuses the heck out of the reader.
I love the great customer service by the flight attendants,pilots and ticketing agents.The fares are really reasonable.They need more food options to offer to the passengers.
I've called this the "honorary" word of the day because it doesn't pertain to me, but to my sister. I couldn't pass it up because I'm so very excited about my niece-or-nephew-to-be, but if it were my only word of the day, it might cause some worry on the part of you, my dear readers, in terms of to whom the word refers... Hence, "honorary."
Skin is made up of two main layers, the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is composed of a set of dead or dying skin cells that cover another layer of cells, which are in the process of developing and maturing. The very outer level of the epidermis is called the stratum conreum, and it is this skin layer that is exposed to all the ills of weather, time, and problems that tend to impact the skin. It does its best to work as a barrier to prevent damage to the lower skin levels. Unfortunately, the stratum conreum layer tends to highlight skin imperfections like fine lines and wrinkles or skin blemishes.
The health benefits are considerable. New research has shown that a daily glass of pomegranate juice can hold back prostate cancer and could even prevent men dying of the disease.Last year US researchers at the University of Wisconsin showed that pomegranate juice dramatically slows down prostate cancer in mice. Prostate cancer patients who have short doubling times (the time taken for the tumour to double in size) are more likely to die from their illness, and the average doubling time for the disease is about 15 months. But drinking pomegranate juice extended this period to 54 months - an almost four-fold increase.
Like most adults, children love reflexology; it calms and relaxes them, it helps with the joys, fears, bewilderment and excitement which are all part of growing up, and, as with adults, it can have many medical benefits.However from the perspective of the reflexologist, treating children presents challenges you do not face from your adult clients. In this article I will explore these differences, and will discuss how the reflexologist can adapt and ensure that the experience is maximally positive for both child and therapist.
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add beaten egg and buttermilk to well and mix in with a wooden spoon until dough is too stiff to stir. Dust hands with a little flour, then gently knead dough in the bowl just long enough to form a rough ball. If the dough is too sticky to work with, add in a little more flour. Do not over-knead!
United Front Games is the second studio to take on the True Crime franchise. The first, Luxoflux, was closed by Activision little over a month ago. With the new studio, and the new talent, comes a fresh take on True Crime. In a preview session at least week's Game Developers Conference, developers name checked the Hulk, Star Trek and Batman as inspirations. With no member of Luxoflux on board, this, they say, is a whole new game.
This is the prime ingredient of all moisturizers. Moisturizers are generally an oil-in-water solution. When you apply moisturizers, some of the water evaporates while some gets absorbed into the skin. The outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum soaks water efficiently; however, it is not able to bind it very well. That's why it needs an oily substance that helps lock in the water within the skin, and this is how moisturizers work. The water contents get absorbed within the skin and the oil content helps keep it there.
Student teaching is harder than I ever thought it would be. I'm sick to my stomach with anxiety most mornings, and unfortunately, middle schoolers sense weakness so they can prey on it. I also happened to pick a very bad month to stop taking my PMDD medication. I've tested and now I know that it was definitely not a placebo effect that was keeping me happy. I can start taking my "happy" pills again in a few days so hopefully I'll bounce back somewhat. Knowing that I'm not doing as well as I should be with my teaching is also making me more anxious and very depressed and that leads to less than energetic teaching which circles back around to being more depressed and so on and so forth.
There are a variety of anti aging skin care products available in the market, be it anti-wrinkle creams or face-lifting skin care formulations. Anti aging products claim to prevent and/or erase the common signs of aging like wrinkles and fine lines and enhance the overall skin quality.
Often, women become increasingly concerned with their skin condition as they grow older, and as a result they try out various anti aging skin care formulations to correct the situation.
If you’ve been watching any of these programmes, you will have heard the term BMI (Body Mass Index), which indicates your recommended weight taking into account your height. Experts have been popularising the term BMI to assess whether you are in your healthy weight zone. If you haven’t already done so, to calculate your BMI, divide your weight in kg by your height in metres, or just look use a BMI Calculator to have it done for you.
I was in a car accident and needed a rental car until mine was fixed. I called up Enterprise and they set me up with the same type of vehicle that I own, so I didn't have to get readjusted to another type of vehicle. They were fast, freindly, and very helpful. And just like the commercial says, I called Enterprise and they picked me up.
I recently went on a leisure vacation trip to South Korea and then to Hong Kong. Although I flew Asiana on the front and back flights, the Korea to Hong Kong leg was flown on Thai airlines. I suppose it was a rough comparison having flown Asiana which is a newer airline with more lux amenities in business class, and then going to Thai in business class. The service was excellent, but the facilities and craft seemed a bit old. It wasn't as spacious as Asiana was and instead of a large enclosed screen to each person, in Thai, there were tiny pull out TV screens
I took 3 kids to Disneyworld and then on the Disney Cruise - talk about needing a vacation. The people on the ship were fantastic. The kids all had different clubs to go to, they had a fantastic time, always something for them to do. I missed dinner due to just needing a nap one night, I received a call from my service crew, wanting to know if everything was alright, offering me a later dinner time or to send me room service. When leaving, 2 of my kids left behind items.
I own a small natural health supplement store in San Diego and Lavada has been my top selling product by a landslide.  It contains the full array of vitamins and minerals for women's everyday health plus additional probiotics, herbs and botanicals to maintain our natural feminine health.  It's no surprise why women have been flocking to my store for Lavada.
Have you checked out the Eggcellent Eggs kit in the Occasions Mini Catalog? It was made for decorating Easter Eggs with rub-ons, diecut flowers and rhinestones. There are also stands for resting your eggs on for display but the green stand looks like grass and that was the inspiration for today's card. I used the wide oval punch to make Easter eggs out of designer series paper. Isn't this adorable?!?

Thanks for stopping by!
Two of your children get into an argument and when you can't figure out which one is fibbing, you send them into another room to "get their story straight" reminding them that whoever is at fault will be punished. When they return, they have both come to the conclusion that it was the child who was sitting beside you on the couch the whole time that was responsible for starting the fight.
I was sick and pukie the whole fuckin' time. I'm buzzed right now, that's why I'm completely derogatory right now. I ate once today. Fried catfish with black beans and rice. One meal a day is not good. I just ate some Captain Crunch Berry Marshmellow Treats made with Cannaba-ghee. I should be feeling it soon.
WOW. I am one of those moms that said I would never drive a minivan.. Well we shopped around for ever.. When I finally tried the Sienna, I loved it. We owned a 2005 Sienna which got totaled in a car accident in which my entire family was in (me, hubby and 3 kids under the age of 6). No one was hurt. In 3 days we purchased a new one.. I absolutely love it. It drives awesome, it's so comfortable and there is tons of space for 7 passengers and lots of cargo space.
Like many customers, I thought John's Place was strictly a tire sales and service shop. When you have an "exotic" car you are somewhat limited when you need tires, wheels and service. The first time we had a flat, we called around to other stores. We were told that the tire would have to be shipped from Kansas or Texas and it would take days and cost $$$. Fortunately, someone told us about Duxler. When we called we learned Duxler, a.k.a., John's Place, had the tire in stock and they could install it that day.
