Here is a simple a tip that can keep you from pulling your hair out. Before you approach your ex about a concern, write out a script along with possible replies from your ex. Then revise your script as many times as you possibly can until you are certain you are not taking an attacking, blaming, threatening, or condescending tone and approach. Really put your words to the test. Get honest about how you would respond to a similar approach. When you are sure you have the best possible script, memorize it and give it a go, but only when the timing is right.
