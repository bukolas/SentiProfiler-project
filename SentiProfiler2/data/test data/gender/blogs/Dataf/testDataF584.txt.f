Fun tea towels can really perk up a kitchen (and they make great present wrapped around a bottle of wine). I like these friendly whales . P.S. More dish towels . (Via Lena ) Now that we're so close to meeting our little guy , I've been gazing at babies on the street and looking up baby photos on flickr. I just can't get enough of babies! This flickr photo called " brushing our teeth " is so cute, it makes my heart hurt. Love this anchor tote (and it's denim!). Only $20 from A.P.C. Everyone hopes for sun on their wedding days, but sometimes rain and fog can be even more romantic, don't you think? Emily and Jasen got hitched in the Hudson Valley on a foggy day, and their photos are magical. P.S. A very rainy wedding . (Photos by Our Labor of Love ) My sweet readers, what are you up to this weekend? Alex and I are actually escaping to Los Angeles and Palm Springs for a week, for a final vacation before the baby arrives. We rented this cottage in L.A., and will be staying at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs. I'm so excited to go swimming and just relax. Next week, I've scheduled some favorite photographs to post every day, so please continue to visit, if you'd like. Meanwhile, here are a few great posts from around the web...xoxo Oh my goodness, this baby was born in a CAB ! Spring lip colors . Yummy-looking sandwich . Green postcards . (Just add water.) Love this braid . Funny cafe sign . This post makes me so wanderlusty! Pretty print . This made me laugh. " I'd Rather Be Thrifting ." (I know about twenty girls who need that print.) Cute sailing tee . San Francisco is so gorgeous. The Luther burger would give you a heart attack but it might be worth it. What a playful wedding . Bonus for all readers: Journelle , an amazing lingerie shop (and one of this month's sponsors), is offering 15% off with the code CUPOFJO. Plus, five Cup of Jo posts you might have missed: - Twenty-four different accents . - Wedding makeup . - Cacio e Pepe . - Side knot . - Seagull tote . (Photo credit unknown) Since those Jenga photos a couple days ago mysteriously hid my giant belly, here's a shot that I took that same night to send to my mom. (I wasn't going to post it because I have a weird expression and the lighting is all yellow, but oh well, here you are!) I snapped it in our living-room mirror while Alex was cooking dinner. Recently the baby has been kicking SO much, and it is ridiculously cute. He's so kicky that if I lean back while watching TV, my tummy will actually ripple, like waves in the ocean. It's really sci-fi and awesome to watch him bumping around, and, needless to say Alex and I find it endlessly endearing. Thank you so much for being so sweet, as always; it's such a treat to share everything with you. xo My sister sometimes paints her nails rad colors (yellow, baby blue), so I think she'd love these space nails .

Bonus: Under each orange is a sweet birthday note from a loved one. Genius. (Via Oh Happy Day )
