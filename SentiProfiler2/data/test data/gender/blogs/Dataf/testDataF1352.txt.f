I can't seem to get enough of the very talented Diem Chau 's unusual work. While her porcelain work is amazing, it's her carved crayola crayons that continue to blow me away. I have blogged about her carved crayons in the past , but recently she tackled the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac which are now on exhibit at the Packer Schopf Gallery in Chicago along with many of her ceramic works in a show named Sojourn. First, the 12 symbols of the Chinese Zodiac: Now, Diem Chau's Zodiac Crayons: She began with the monkey on the far right (note how she wrote on the crayons which was to become which animal): and once they were finished, she mounted each carved crayon on a wood pedestal for exhibition: above: all twelve Chinese Zodiac crayons, finished and mounted.

Take a look. above background photo by yang yi Below is the article by Conor Risch for PDN, followed by images from each of the 30 photographers and links to their personal sites. Look at the photographers in this year’s PDN’s 30 class and you’ll find a solid refutation of the idea that “everyone is a photographer now.” Did “everyone” move to Beijing to freelance for the AP with no financial guarantee like Danfung Dennis? Or live out of a mini-van so they could create a major project like Scott Conarroe? Or defy social norms to become one of the only female photojournalists from Gaza like Eman Mohammed? Is “everyone” willing to be as patient as Alex Prager, who put on her own shows when gallerists ignored her? Does “everyone” have 2,250 followers on Flickr like Ben Roberts? Perseverance and determination are common to all these photographers but equally notable is the individuality of their interests and styles. These photographers have produced long-term projects on music scenes (Lauren Dukoff), orthodox Hasidic communities (Clémence De Limburg), and a mother’s paranoid schizophrenia (Sohrab Hura). They have used the visual language of gritty reportage to shoot cookbooks (Gabriel Stabile) and created photojournalism based on “a sense of feeling” (Andy Spyra). They have used modern image-making techniques to lament the destruction of a centuries-old city (Yang Yi). They tell stories that matter to them in ways that make them matter to viewers. Yes, it’s true: a lot more people are taking pictures now than when PDN was founded 30 years ago. But only a very small percentage of those people are photographers. We salute these 30 individuals, who are helping to define what being a photographer means today. —Conor Risch Click on each artist's name below (shown in alphabetical order) to visit their website or portfolio. levi brown: alejandro cartagena: scott conarroe: sumit dayal: clemence de limburg: gratiane de moustier: danfung dennis: lauren dukoff: matt eich: matthieu gafsou: marcelo gomes: deborah hamon: estelle hanania: ben hoffmann: sohrab hura: wayne lawrence: brent lewin: eman mohammed: adrian mueller: nick onken: alex prager: thomas prior: ben roberts: anna skladmann: andy sprya: gabriele stabile: peter van agtmael: elizabeth weinberg: yang yi: reed young: You can view more pieces from each of these 30 photographers at PDN's online gallery here.

I'm talking about truly creating your own chocolate bars from scratch. above: three examples of possible options for your own created chocolate bars chocri is a German startup, founded in September 2008, but launched in the US in January 2010. What they do is we allow you to customize your own chocolate bar right on their website. You start with an organic Belgian chocolate base of milk, white or dark chocolate and then choose from a selection of over 100 of gourmet, organic and exotic ingredients (fruit, grains, nuts, spices, confections and decor). If you don't know anything about ingredients, they also offer many recommended combinations and options to make the selection simple. Once you've chosen or built your bar, you can name it (they print the name and the ingredients on the package), and then they hand-make the bars in Germany and ship them off to you. From bacon to blueberries, pretzels to pecans, you can be as adventurous or as safe as you'd like. I made three to test them out (shown below). One was dark chocolate with real orange bits and orange chocolate drops, another was milk chocolate, pecans and toffee and the third was milk chocolate with organic salted pretzels and caramel chocolate drops. And yes, they are, er.... were, delicious. So, how do you do it? You start with your choice of milk, white or dark chocolate as the base: Then you are walked through the process to choose as many or as few additives as you wish from the following options (click on each image below to enlarge): Choose your fruit: Your spices: Your nuts: Your confections: Your decor: Your grains: There's no minimum. You can choose to make one bar or one hundred bars. Once you've selected your ingredients for your chocolate bar(s), they print the name you choose and the ingredients on the individual package, then ship them right to your door. They use only the best ingredients, such as organic, fair trade chocolate from Belgium. Making them even more delicious is the fact that they also donate a percentage of otheir revenues to DIV Kinder, an organization that supports children at the Ivory Coast, and you are free to add your own donation at checkout. above: the Chocri team What are you waiting for? With Easter and Mother's Day right around the corner, these would make awesome gifts. Get started here. If you like chocolate, you'll love this: The Art of Chocolate. Oops, Reverse That. http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss Conde Nast UK's LOVE magazine is a bi-annually fashion forward publication that launched in February 2009. Filled with edgy and artful photography by such well-known photographers as Terry Richardson, Mario Testino, Josh Olins, David Sims, Sølve Sundsbø, Juergen Teller, Angelo Pannetta and of course, Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the magazine is light on editorial and heavy on nude models. For their third issue, they featured 8 different covers of nude supermodels Lara Stone, Jeneil Williams, Amber Valletta, Naomi Campbell, Kristen McMenemy, Daria Werbowry, Natalia Vodianova and Kate Moss with strategically placed censor bars. The magazine also includes editorial shots of the same models baring all. above: Kristen McMenamy from the interior editorial in the magazine Shot by talented and respected fashion photographers Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott , and styled by Katie Grand, the magazine's 3rd issue and its 8 covers were very hyped. The Gap (UK) even proposed a limited edition Tee of each of the 8 covers: The T-shirts went on sale now at Dover Street Market in London and Colette in Paris, priced £30 and quickly sold out. All profits from the GAP LOVE tee shirts went to support Haiti. The one exception was Kate Moss' tee, whose profits went to Great Ormond Street, a UK children's charity. All 8 covers are shown below, along with a few of the very risqué, but stunning editorial shots. As artful as they are, this makes this post inappropriate for those under 18. Please view with discretion. above: the first projected cover with Lara Stone, and the original photo, prior to deciding to put the censor bars over the naughty bits. The covers were then published as below: Lara Stone Jeneil Williams Daria Werbowy Kristen McMenamy Amber Valletta Kate Moss Naomi Campbell Natalia Vodianova The images of the same models, inside, however are not censored and here are a few of those photos for you.

My first reaction was "eeeeuuuuwww", then "hmmmmm", followed by "naaaah." But others may claw their way to this new social networking site that capitalizes on the growing trend of older women dating (seducing?) younger men. The brains behind the concept, Shelli Netko, the founder and president of Cougars &amp; Co. says: "My main goal in starting Cougars &amp; Co. was to create an environment where women could learn to love the life they live and live the life the love. After all, age is just a number. Recent surveys show 34% of women in their 40s date men who are younger and 17% of women in their 50s do the same. This isn't just a trend, it's a new social norm that both women and men are obviously embracing. Women are gravitating to younger men because they seem to have more of an energetic spirit that matches theirs. Women are taking better care of themselves, as a result, 40 is the new 30; 50 is the new 40. So the age difference becomes a non-issue. You don't have to be a Hollywood star to go out with someone 10 or 15 years your junior, but God Bless Demi Moore for bringing it into the spot light!" above: the world's most well-known Cougar and Cub; stunning actress Demi Moore and her hottie husband, Ashton Kutcher. The press release: The dating jungle just became that much wilder with the recently launched social networking company Cougars &amp; Co. The brainchild of Arizona entrepreneur Shelli Netko, Cougars &amp; Co. is a members-only online community where older women and younger men have the opportunity to meet, mix and mingle, shop and travel all in the name of fun. Cougars &amp; Co. getaways are for the cougar or cub in you who needs a little “me” time – think R&amp;R with a little bit of “BAM!” “The cougar and cub culture is a growing trend that is less concerned with age and focused on reinventing yourself at any age,” Netko said. “While we plan to go nationwide with our charity bachelor auctions, we thought Scottsdale was the perfect place to introduce the Cougars &amp; Co. concept and begin our social network.” The site , which is now live, is offering an introductory $1 membership to those that join during the first month. After April 30, the monthly membership fee is $9.95. Members can join the hunt by creating a profile, joining groups, creating their own groups and initiating online connections. For members looking to get out, monthly happy hour events will be held and year-round getaway vacations for cougars and cubs will be organized. The Charity Bachelor Auction As part of the company kick-off, Cougars &amp; Co. is holding a charity bachelor auction on Thursday, April 1st in Scottsdale, AZ. Valley cougars will be pleased to see there's much more on the men-u than chips and dip when as many as 10 cubs (including a past contender for The Bachelorette) strut their stuff all in the name of charity. Proceeds from the event will benefit the Women's Wellness Center at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Care

A retrospective of fashion legend Yves Saint Laurent opened yesterday at the Petit Palais in Paris, only two years after his death in 2008. The impressive retrospective covers 15 chapters of his career, its critical acclaim and occasional failures, including his 1971 forties-inspired "scandal collection", which was pummeled by critics at the time. above photos © Fondation Pierre Bergé - Yves Saint Laurent The exhibit begins with his early work for Christian Dior and continues through to his last final collection, in 2002. In total, there are 307 pieces of couture and ready-to-wear fashions accompanied by films, artwork and photos. above: Yves Saint Laurent in his Dior studio above: Yves Saint Laurent in his own studio, 1986 Designs for Catherine Deneuve in the 1967 movie Belle de Jour , Lauren Bacall, and the Duchess Of Windsor are included as well as creations that were inspired by art, far away places (he is said to have used his imagination and preferred that to travel) and the glamour of Hollywood.
