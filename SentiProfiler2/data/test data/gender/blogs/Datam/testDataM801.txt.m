AUSTIN, Texas - Twitter CEO Evan Williams on Monday announced @anywhere, a service designed to make it easier for Twitter content to be directly incorporated into Web sites.The announcement was part of Evans' keynote interview at the annual SXSW conference here. The @anywhere service is designed to make it easier to use the service without using twitter.com or a client app like Tweetdeck."Users will be about to follow their favorite columnist or writer directly from the publishers' site," Williams said. Currently, the process of following someone requires a Twitter log-in.
