First, let me thank you for your recent comment on my site as well as your support to my plight. Thank you, my brother. Now, I see you are from Leonville, La. The name of your town has nostalgia written all over my recollections. We used to play Leonville High. We, as in Sunset High basketball team. When everybody on their team was called 'Davis.' Lol. Those were the days, some 20+ years ago. I doubt you remember all that because you couldn't have been any older than 6 or so; before the merger/consolidation of all area high schools - to form Beau Chene High. You know there was a time, when I was about 10 years old or so, when I thought I could save the world. From what or who, I had no clue. All I knew was I was going to wrap a white sheet around my neck for a cape. I was going to gly away in my mind...fight the bad guys in my mind...then fly my 'Louise' away...just like the movies...in my mind. But, then I'd conclude that I needed a sidekick and since I had none, my plans were only an illusion. However, when i was a child, I thought like one. Now that I am a man, I'm called upon to act like one. See brother, black leaders don't exist anymore because the influential brothers and sisters are leaders and heroes only in their minds, wearing sheets for capes...looking for a sidekick or fall partner. No one wants to be the positive one, in singular form. I get that. I really do. It takes mean and women who possess moxie to lead. Men and women who are not slaves to corporate influences, or social intimidation. The world watches doers of deeds, not speakers of rhetoric. As a black race, we have placed ourselves back into the wilderness, and no one seems to even notice it. Too busy 'bling-blinging' until ignorant cataracts have blinded us all socially and morally. I wish, when I was free, that my mind would have been so loyal to reality as it is now. There's so much I could have done (would still love to do) to help out our people to see the reality of our existence. See, it only takes one to lead 'some' in the right direction....you, yes you can be that 'one.' You don't build a house by placing a roof up first. No. You build the foundation from the bottom up. You can start by educating the young. Teach them, and lead them into the realm of truth. And when they grow up, your voice and reasoning will be their beacon of justice and a new revolution that will break the chains of ignorance from our people once and for all. Our future rests in our children. Never doubt that! On that note, take care....I'm here for you.
