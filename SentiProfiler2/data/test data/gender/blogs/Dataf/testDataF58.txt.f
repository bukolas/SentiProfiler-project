Prologue - Colin returns from the groceries store...opens his apartment door...and what does he see?
Dignam waiting with a suppressed pistol all geared up for a perfect kill. He raises his pistol and points at Colin.
Colin,who takes a moment to register the situation, reacts with "OK"(accepting it, sort of).
Dignam fires...

Wat was the reason for Colin's indifferent reaction?
1-->He was pissed off with his damn life
2-->He thought he deserved (with a sense of guilt) to die...
3-->He knows there is no way out of it

okay folks... you can stop scratching your heads now coz this is definitely not some cat compre question! ;P
Its the final scene from the movie 'The Departed'(...rings a bell?) and if u haven't watched the movie, i suggest u do (one of Martin Scorsese's best). So, you might wonder, what has it got to do with what im about to write? n what the heck is genoesis?!? (atleast i got you wondering now :P)

Well, it all started with one of those regular "debates"(u can substitute "combats" :P)with a friend of mine. Being big time movie analysers(what to do...gotta find some work! ;P), we were arguing about Matt Damon's(Colin's) reaction in the final scene of the movie . "Colin accepted his fate with remorse(ready to die) for all that he has done n happened..." was my fren's side of the argument..in contrast to mine that he(Colin) accepted his fate coz he knows thers no escape under the circumstance. Each of us tried to convince the other but only in vain.The argument, of course ended up with no conclusion..

Now you may have your own version(i wonder what the original version is if there is one) of this depending on what you infer and all of us may feel correct at our own reasons . The reasons which are the psychological result of learning and perception ....the perception of one's mind which involves one's life in the making.. n life which varies from person to person(deep huh?). This very insight gives an insight into how distinct the psychology of a homosapien can be from a  fellow homosapien..

So, here i am, coming up with the name GENOESIS(GEet(a)+ NOESIS)...unique n me, on a journey...where im not only the player, exploring and exploiting the 'noesis' part of me, but also a spectator just watching the way it leads to.
