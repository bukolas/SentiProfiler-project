She’s arguably the hottest star in the music world right now, thanks to her amazing dance beats and wilder than life stage persona, and now, Lady Gaga brings crustaceans to the limelight... Much cooler than the last crustacean-inspired headwear. Spotted at The Daily Mail . Over the last few months, there has been much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about strategy and tactics over how to communicate with non-scientists, and how to regain public trust over issues like climate change . A good example of this was a recent email exchange between Matt Nisbet and Randy Olson . Nisbet: When scientists... take action by responding with tit-for-tat attacks on climate skeptics, it... feeds a downward spiral of “war” and conflict rhetoric that appears as just more ideological rancor to the wider public. Olson: There comes a point where the public DOES want to see the science community stand up for themselves. People arguing that scientists are losing to denialists in areas like climate science because they have taken a poor approach to communication are perhaps mischaracterizing the problem. The problem of what approach scientists use to communicate with non-scientists is a real problem, but it is minuscule in these cases. Scientists have to, you know, do science in addition to communication with non-scientists. Denialists, as far as I can tell, can devote 100% of their time to communication. If scientists want to win, we need to find a way to support a dedicated crew of people whose job is to do nothing else but do public relations. Why don’t national academies and organizations for the advancement of science have full-time, professional communicators? The only organization that I can think of that is even close to the sort of “think tank” person who seems to be so routinely called for media interviews is the National Center for Science Education . They do a heroic job, but there’s only sixteen people listed on staff, including some whose job is in no way related to science. Allocation of resources is a major problem, and time is a 100% non-renewable resource. People who can devote time to that will, in the short term, win. The good news may be that because scientists are responsible for generating new knowledge, that can help in the long term. Ultimately, denialists cannot create anything new. Image from here . Canadian Girl Postdoc has a great post about how power relationships filter into conversations in the academic blogosphere. Miriam at Deep Sea News talks about how fact-based science communication is failing. Facts are good; a plan is better. FlowingData shows the “ How genetics works ” picture, which should be called, “How genetics was thought to work in the eighteenth century or so.” Biochem Bell asks if a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . Or something. Doctor Becca then takes this and runs with it some more . (Actually, they’re both concerned with high prestige journals.) David Crotty at The Scholarly Kitchen examines a wonky paper on science blogging , and asks, “If you knew people read your blog, would you blog differently?” (I’m paraphrasing there...) Jeff Jarvis at BuzzMachine asks, “ In the Google age, what is the point of teaching memorization? ” An excellent question, and one I also struggle with. Sheril Kirshenbaum asks at The Intersection what readers want to know about energy . I’m perpetually confused by nuclear power generation and whether it’s worth it or not. Armin Schneider, in a book review in PLoS Biology , says neuroscientists must not be interested in the history of their field, because the aren’t a lot of people in the history poster sessions. He neglects to mention that the history posters are displayed all week long, while regular posters are only up for four hours. Visits to the history posters are going to be more spread out. Nancy Duarte wanted feedback on the cover for her next book . It’ll be called Resonate , and I guarantee you I’ll be buying it whichever cover ends up on it. Yes, it’s about the Texas State Board of Education and the Texas K-12 education standards. Again. I’ve tried to limit my comments to stuff related to science, particularly biology, because that’s what I feel competent to make comments about. As a faculty member at a university that has about 85% Hispanic students, however, I feel obligated to highlight this bit from a New York Times article yesterday. It concerns the ongoing review of the state’s social studies standards. Efforts by Hispanic board members to include more Latino figures as role models for the state’s large Hispanic population were consistently defeated, prompting one member, Mary Helen Berlanga , to storm out of a meeting late Thursday night, saying, “They can just pretend this is a white America and Hispanics don’t exist.” Ms. Berlanga is the representative for the area that includes my institution, by the way. There’s much more of interest in the Times piece. Last equipment post for a while, but by no means least. Finally, something a little bit more high tech than forceps and a microscope . A 60 cycle noise eliminator, the HumBug . To understand how marvelous this little box is, I have to explain a little about electrophysiology. Everything you’re using to read this blog post runs off a powerline. So do lights and other electrical appliances. Those electric powerlines generate noise, or a “ hum ,” that cycles 60 times a second in North American, and 50 times a second in Australia and, I think, the U.K. This “60 cycle” is picked up by recording electrodes, like those used to record neural activity. Since biologists are interested in the biology and not power mains, the 60 cycle just gets in the way of seeing the actual biological signal. So eletrophysiologists have to spend huge amounts of time trying to eliminate that 60 cycle noise by grounding, using Faraday cages, tinfoil, alligator clamps, and offerings to minor deities. Worse, it’s incredibly unpredictable. A set-up that is perfect one day may have horrible 60 cycle the next day. Thus, anything that helps combat 60 cycle is a beautiful thing. And that is what this clever little device does. I had no idea it existed until I went to the annual Neuroscience meeting the year I was hired, and discovering it alone made the trip worthwhile. I had never met Carin Bondar until I followed her on Twitter . Only after that did I learn that we have several colleagues in common, so there is absolutely no “old boy’s club” networking behind her decision to put me in Nerd Corner this week. Nerd Corner? It’s like a regular corner, only, you know, nerdier. Actually, Carin thought I might be interesting enough to interview. I sure fooled her. Carin has a great website , with lots of other interviews, career resources, and more. Tell her Zen sent ya! P.S. – She’s not related to Canadian astronaut Roberta Bondar . Continuing this week with some of my favourite things in the lab... Like my first selection, this is something that is basic but absolutely fundamental. A good stereo dissecting microscope, with a mount for a camera. Edward Tufte often argues that much of science is the story of increasing resolving power. The classic example was the telescope, which was celebrated in the last year’s 400 th anniversary celebration of Galileo using the device for such great effect. Microscopes came slightly later, but also revolutionized thinking about the world. When I bought this microscope, I bought a camera lucida for drawing pictures, something I’d use through much of doctoral and post-doctoral work. A good drawing could provide more information more efficiently than using 35 mm film then. I have rarely used it, since digital photography had made it faster and more efficient to take a lot of photographs and work with those. Last month, I complained about the common misconception that tenure was “a job for life.” Florida State University has just provided an example of why it’s a misconception. Twenty-five examples, in fact. My sympathy to those losing their positions. The prospect of losing a job is always terrifying.
