In order to figure out the market and where you should set the price there is the basic supply and demand graph. (Red is supply, blue is demand)

This makes sense if there is more of an item, people will want/need less, so the price will have to go down to so people will again be enticed to buy and than the supply will go down creating a demand so what follows is the price going up.

While there is many other flaws I will focus on the idea of Demand.

What you may not have realized is that the idea of demand gets down to the social-psychology and the very nature of man. --or maybe you did think of that--

Demand is: how much of a specific commodity can be sold in a definite market in a fixed period of time. Generally this is quanitified

In order to measure demand
A) the commodity in question needs to exist
B) the commodity needs to be in play in that market for that fixed period of time.

Often the idea of demand is paired with something like food, surely food is the oldest commodity and is present in every culture and market on the planet. BUT everyone values food differently and it is only partially paired with our biological need to eat. Crazy?

From my experience (maybe not yours) I have met picky eaters, I have met healthy eaters, I have met meat eaters, and vegetarians, and those who like mexican and german and italian and ---you get the idea. Our demand for food is not just our body telling us to eat, its our "sense of self" telling us WHAT to eat. Yes, even our demand for food (at least in the modernized countries) is simply a product of our socialization and how we percieve reality. Demand has little relation to supply except for percieved scarcity and also a social constructed desire for that commodity.
