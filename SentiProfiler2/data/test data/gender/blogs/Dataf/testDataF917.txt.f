I will not stop till I have this figured out.
Healing is my priority.

I've come a long way from the days of eating Entemann's cakes and drive thru food on the sneak.
I'm no longer "addicted" to diet soda, caffeine and coffee.

Every time I knock down an unhealthy habit I expect to feel great relief.
I am not greatly relieved as yet
BUT and every one loves a big BUTT....
I'm still plugging away at this.

I do not accept "food addict" as a label. Thank God I didn't.
I do not accept low calorie diets and overexercising as the answer to obesity.
I do not accept being tired all the time as normal.

I'm fighting the good fight.
