Thank you for all who voted in the poll. Eighty-one percent of you believe I should put ads on the blog. I'm going to wait and see. Reasons are: 1) Ads don't jive with the purpose of the blog I've started this "guerilla" undercover lunch project... and then you guys, my readers, get some weird off-beat Goo*gle ads, which most likely will have nothing to do with what I'm doing here. 2) Donations and transparency I love the idea of making a donation to a farm-to-school initiative and I may just do that on my own time. But if I set up ads, how do I do that? with my real name? and SSN#? And then I'm assuming I get the ad check directly, which then I have to deposit and then turn around and donate. Basically, I can't make it go from blog to organization unless I put a donate button. I haven't done enough research into specific organizations and I don't want it to look like I'm endorsing some over others. So now is not the right time. 3) Lack of time I don't have very much time what with working, family life, and running our home. If running ads even adds just 10 minutes per day of extra work, I honestly don't have that time. I'm already going to bed way later than usual because of the project. I just can't do any more than I'm already doing. I can barely find time to read all of your excellent comments! *** I was thinking that if I decide to go with ads, I could donate the ad revenue to my school when/if I get found out. I think I'm going to get "busted" one day and I'm unsure of what ramifications there would be. But if I could off-set the bad press with a little ad revenue for my school, that could be a nice way to smooth things over.
