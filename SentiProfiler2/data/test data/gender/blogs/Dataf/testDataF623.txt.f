Sorry today's post is late today, I fell asleep on the couch last night while watching TV, and woke up late this morning, too late to do my nails before work. SOOOOO you get after-work nails!! YAYYYYY! Tonight I get to make Guinness Chocolate Cupcakes for St. Pat's Day tomorrow!!! They're delish!! MMMM. I used MAC Blue India, the gorgeous new color from their Liberty of London Collection as a base, with Sally Hansen All the White Stuff sponged on the tips, and then two layers of Essie Funky Limelight sponged over that! :) Thinking I might drink a Guinness while the cupcakes bake- good idea? I think so. The idea for today's manicure came to me a while ago, and I had it written amongst the ideas in my notebook. I think when I originally thought of the idea, I envisioned the cage black, but I think this way works too! :) I used Orly Snowcone as a base, with American Apparel Manila for the yellow birds, and China Glaze Salsa over Sally Hansen All the White Stuff for the red birds. American Apparel Hassid for the legs and the eyes, and China Glaze 2030 from Khrome Collection for the birdcages. Today's nails are simple, bread class wears me out, so I usually don't have much time to paint my nails before I fall into a bread class induced coma. I did, however, get a chance to use my new American Apparel Office polish that I got the other day. This polish, sadly, was less than stellar. The color is amaaaaazing, but it took 3, and probably should've used 4, coats to have full coverage, a far cry from my beloved 1-coat Hassid. Seems like the AA polishes are hit-and-miss pigment-wise. They're all great great great colors, but some are vastly more pigmented than others. Anyway. I used American Apparel Office as a base, with China Glaze Millennium applied with Konad Plate m63. Topped everything off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat. Hey all! Today's manicure was inspired by a set of notecards that I found in the $1 section of Target!! I love graphic prints, and one of my favorite color combos is aqua and chocolate brown...soooo... here you go! The inspiration: The nails: I used China Glaze For Audrey as a base, with Nubar Milk Chocolate Creme for the dots and lines. Topped it all off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat. (Kinda makes it look like they're wrapped in cellophane, like the notecards!! :-P Hey all!!! Today's mani is inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. :-D For the accent nail I did the iconic Hitchcock profile graphic. :-) A better view of the profile: I used American Apparel Cotton as a base on all the bird nails, and American Apparel Hassid for the Hitchcock nail, as well as the birds. I seriously can't get the Hitchcock intro music out of my head. Hey all!! Just a note to let you know that Vincent Longo stuff is on Hautelook today and this weekend. everything is 65% off!!! There are lipsticks, lip pencils, eye shadows, eye liners, colored mascaras, bronzers. lipglosses, etc. CHEAP!! Hautelook Ok, not sure what inspired this, but I thought of it as I was falling asleep last night. I'm glad I remembered this morning when I set out to paint my nails. :-P Just something simple, but recognizable (I hope? :-P) I used American Apparel Hassid as a base, with Pure Ice Wild Thing and Nubar Forest mixed for the heart monitor line. Topped it off with only one coat of Seche Vite top coat, since I was in a hurry! Hey all!! Jumping on the Ruffian-inspired manicure bandwagon. I instantly loved those nails when I saw them, and all the interpretations I've seen lately were lovely and made me want to try my own, with my own twist. I used China Glaze Ruby Pumps as a base, and then freehanded the black with my newest love, American Apparel Hassid, using the brush from the bottle. The black is ONE coat. Seriously. I'm in awe of this polish. I topped it off with 2 coats of Seche Vite top coat.
