Hello everyone, My stepdad Timothy Blackburn A.K.A Mistrust has just recently done a remix for New Zealand band Pitch Black. The song that he has remixed is called “Rude Mechanicals” so please listen. The song is on Mistrust's Myspace page is a sample of the song because the full song is being released on 27th of October this year. So please listen and tell me what you think.
Fred McGriff was selected by the Yankees as the last pick in the 9th round of the 1981 June draft, fresh out of high school and then as soon as he started to get his feet wet BLAM! Traded to the Blue Jays with Dave Collins and Mike Morgan for Dale Murray and Tom Dodd. Drafted one summer, traded the end of the next year. That's either a major confidence booster (that another team would want him) or a huge letdown (the most storied team in the sport gave up on him enough to throw him in on a minor trade). As fans it's exciting to welcome new players onto our favorite teams, but what about how the players themselves feel? It's no wonder that many reiterate to the media that it's just a business and this is the way this business works. Because what are the alternatives? You can pout, go AWOL, or grit your teeth, say goodbye to your friends and pack your suitcase for the next town. I'm a Red Sox fan, but it's not hard to see why Brian Giles, though marooned on a terrible Padres team, wouldn't accept a trade to the contending Sox. He has a life to consider, and he's been around long enough to be afforded a choice in his future. Why would you sacrifice that? (I've never been traded. But if I were, I bet I could bring at least fifteen head of cattle and a few bushels of wheat. Or a bag of balls.)
 In my most recent Times column about the President's budget, I wrote, Making matters worse, these bleak budget projections are based on relatively optimistic economic assumptions. The administration forecasts economic growth of 3.0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010, followed by 4.3 percent the next year. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent for these two years. Lower growth would mean less tax revenue, larger budget deficits and a more rapidly increasing debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. The CBO has now reestimated the budget effects of the President's proposed policies, and indeed the CBO forecasts larger budget deficits. The CBO's total deficit projected over the decade-long budget window is $1.2 trillion larger than the administration's estimate. The administration projects that the federal government debt held by the public would rise to 77 percent of GDP in 2020 (from 53 percent in 2009). The CBO forecasts a debt-GDP ratio in 2020 of 90 percent.
I must tell you that having a big family assures me of never running out of stories to blog about. This evening Amanda was helping Robin make butter nut squash soup. Apparently you have to cook all the vegetables on the stove top and then while it's still hot puree it in a food processor. As Robin was finished pureeing the delicious smelling soup and transferring it out of the food processor back into the pot, Amanda pulled a chair up to the kitchen counter to see what her mommy was making. As Amanda was watching her mother throw additional spices into the mix Amanda decided that it was her turn………She picked up our cordless telephone and in it went. My telephone that was a beautiful metallic grey was now dripping squash orange. I thought that it was dead. Obviously if the liquid didn't kill it, the heat would have….right? I was amazed, I took a damp towel and dried it off; the darn thing still worked. After about a half hour we received a phone call and Robin picked up. She noticed that it was difficult to hear the person at the other end because squash had gotten into the ear holes. I'll wait until it dries up and I'll use a toothpick to clear it out.
My ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I'm dealing with abstract situations. I believe that in an earlier Treating Adult ADD Blog posting I mentioned my perhaps-Romantic attraction to craftsmanship, and my regrets that I'd not pursued, say, tool-and-die making or furniture building in my youth. (Saying, "I believe…I mentioned" means, as those of you who stop by this stand regularly know, that I may have done so, may not have done so, may think I've done so but haven't or may think I haven't but have. Or that the whole megillah is a fabrication. Fabrication. That's a woodworking joke. Right? OK. I'm moving, officer, I'm moving.) Whatever the antecedents, it's worth mentioning again (or not again…WHAT! NOT AGAIN!!!) why I'm attracted to benchwork. The simple version is that in my case, the ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I'm dealing with abstract situations. (And, as I wrote in my blog the other day, when I'm dealing cards.) (Sorry about all the parens, but there was this going-out-of-business sale at the local Font Hacienda last week and…[obviously, the ellipses {…«which, FYI, are properly set as a single character (and these double arrow thingies are called guillemets and the French use them as "quotation marks")»}] but we can start our discussion of typography some other time, OK?). zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry. It's tiring, balancing all those parens (that's a proofreader's joke, son). Well, obviously typing doesn't count as craftsmanship because you can see how far down the slippery slope I've already skidded here. As a matter of fact, I'm going to go for a walk now and see if I can get all of these random glyphs out of my head. I'll be back shortly, and we can talk about "curly quotes" which the stupid lines around "curly quotes" aren't. And then we can get back to marquetry. And tool-and-die making. And locksmithing. Honey, do you remember if I took my Concerta this morning?
I have had asthma and allergies my entire life. While I bet many asthmatics might disagree with me on this, I think having allergies is far worse than having asthma. Yes, I did say that. I think allergies suck. Asthma is actually easier to control than allergies. Even after I was on Advair and finally had my asthma under control, the allergies continued to irritate the crap out of me. Sure there are allergy shots, but those things did nothing for me but sting my arm once a week for three years. Sure there were antihystamines and decongestants and nasal sprays, but if I'm around one of my allergens, those only took the edge off of that annoying feeling you get in your sinuses and nose. You sneeze. You get a runny nose. You feel down right miserable. I'd rather have an asthma attack. A worse case scenerio for asthma is you have to go to the ER. Yet, even in the ER, there is nothing they can do for allergy symptoms. This did change, however, with the invention of Singulair. Man that drug is awesome - for me anyway. Advair really helps too. Now I can actually be around something I'm allergic to and survive -- like during this flare up. With Singulair my asthma flares still occur if I'm exposed to my allergens, although the flares are not near as bad as they used to be.
Earlier today, on my way home from physical therapy, I stopped by the gym. No, I did not go there in order to work out or exercise. Instead, I collected my yoga mat and turned in my locker key. A few months ago I went through the same routine, feeling all the while defeated by my inability to go to the gym. This time around, I'm approaching things from a different perspective. For the past few years, yoga has been an important part of my life. After having my knee muscles atrophy (and subsequently losing the use of my knees) during one of my pre-diagnosis flares, and after months of daily recuperative physical therapy, I was determined that I would not let that happen again…so I signed up for yoga classes. Within a year I shed almost 50 pounds, was much more flexible, and was feeling great. Within two years, I was performing handstands and forearm stands of all types, was hooking my foot into my elbow behind my head while in pigeon pose, and was coming close to perfecting an unsupported (no arms!) headstand. On some days, I would do power yoga in the morning and power pilates in the evening. I was feeling fit, and I was loving it.
This is truly an amazing story. Late last month, Chris Waddell became the first paraplegic climber to summit Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania - on his own power. This amazing athlete used a specially designed buggy that he peddled with his hands to pull himself up the 19,340-foot mountain, the highest in Africa. The four-wheeled cycle Chris used, called a Bomba, is essentially a highly engineered four wheel mountain bike, capable of taking on one-foot-high boulders. Obviously this wouldn't be an easy task for Chris. In fact, it took him three days and 22 hours of pedaling to push through the last three miles. The dense scree and sand at the top of the mountain - at roughly a 45 degree angle - made the going extremely difficult and slow. Chris said that he was moving about a foot a minute at one point. On his One-Revolution blog site, Waddell said, "I felt like I'd made a statement that we as people could do whatever we wanted, but more profoundly, I saw the benefits of giving someone an opportunity." Mr. Waddell broke his back in a freak skiing accident 21 years ago. Since then he has won 12 medals in downhill ski racing over the course of four Paralympic Games.
Nice little workout this morning at the BSC Westborough today. After getting to the gym I hit the treadmill for a nice 3 mile run. I started at 7.5 and quickly upped it so that the bulk of the running was over 8.0 . I ended up finishing the 3 mile run in 20:59 for an average pace of 6:59/mile with 419 calories burned. After the run I hit the free weight area for some shoulder exercises. I did standing shoulder shrugs with dumbbells, standing shoulder raises, sitting long bar pulldowns, and finished with 150 abs.
I need your help. I've been page by page through the 2009 Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards, and I can't identify this. More precisely, I can't identify the player, the team, or the issue. I have a pretty good idea what era it's from (pre-1919), but even of that I'm uncertain. Some background: I've had this postcard at least 20 years. I can't remember exactly where I got it, but either a family friend who collected postcards and knew I liked baseball stuff, or from the Big Box of Awesome Tobacco Pins I inherited from my great-grandfather. Also, it's the size of a regular postcard, not a cabinet. That's all I know about it. My guess is that the uniform is from one of these types: industrial team, an amateur team, or some sort of low minor league. I've never seen any other cap with a number on it like this, nor do I have any idea what the "CAD" down the front of the flannel stands for. The back is almost blank, which isn't helpful, and there's no photographer's seal or trademark anywhere on the card, which isn't helpful either, but leads me to think this isn't part of a large (or any) set. So, what do I have here?
thimerosal containing vaccines do not cause autism The decisions are in for the second phase of the Omnibus Autism Proceedings—the “vaccine court” trials to determine if autism can be considered as a vaccine injury. The first set of decisions were handed down last year (those regarding the MMR as a causative agent). This set explored whether thimerosal, the mercury containing preservative formerly used in childhood vaccines, could cause autism. The decisions are long, and I expect there to be much discussion. Below are the final paragraphs from the decisions. These are for the three “test cases”, the hearings held for three specific children who petitioned for compensation on the basis of autism as a vaccine injury. They are clear and decisive: the evidence does not support thimerosal containing vaccines as causing autism, in general or in these three children in specific.
Here's a question: How many shots did it take for Al Oliver to settle on this bat? Also, if he ran out of bats, would he have posed holding a metal folding chair? You may have been wondering: what happened to Ben, and why doesn't he post as much as he used to? Well, a lot is going on. I work two jobs, I teach blogging at MIT on weekends, and I'm winding down as a baseball card blogger. I know I've made a number of different assertions as to the future of The Baseball Card Blog, but here's the truth: I will stop writing The Baseball Card Blog as of January 1, 2009, if not sooner. The blog itself will stay up as a fully tagged and searchable archive of everything I've written over the past three years. I've thought long and hard about this, and I've decided that The Baseball Card Blog needs to end. In my opinion, the best card blogs are those with a finite topic. For example, the stellar 1988 Topps Blog, where Andy K posts something about each and every card in the 1988 Topps and Topps Traded sets. When the sets end, the blog ends. It makes sense. But an open-ended blog about one collector reminiscing and finding his way back into the hobby he once loved? Three years is enough of that for me. I'm not really interested in writing about the latest hobby trends, or new cards that I can't afford. When I really think about it, those are the very things that caused my interest to wan in the first place. I will still collect, and will remain open to trading. I will remain as the admin contact at A Pack A Day, as well as our brand new vlog spin-off APADtv. Finally, I know I've made it a point to stick to the script on baseball cards, but I thought I'd make an exception. If you are vegan or enjoy vegan food and live in the San Francisco Bay Area, do yourself a favor and take a look at this new blog: Vegansaurus!. And if you've never tried vegan food, it's better than you think!
Robin has gone off to one of her Physician Assistant conferences and will be away until Friday; which after the first day as Mr. Mom feels like it will be a Friday in a new millennium. This is one of those times where a time machine would come in handy. I believe that this is where my being obsessive compulsive shines. I like order, I need order to survive, and I need order to feel comfortable. That said, trying to be orderly with 4 kids 7 and under doesn't exactly come easy. To maintain that path I must operate on all cylinders all the time and even then, to sustain order I need to take 2 minutes out of every hour to take a deep so that my head doesn't explode. My OC is a safeguard and assures me that nothing falls through the cracks when taking care of my kids. I'm sure you have a clear image in your head of me running around as if my hair was on fire, but I can assure you that things are well under control. The house is clean, the kids are dressed in clean clothes, they're fed, they're on time for school, and most importantly happy. My obsessive compulsive disorder was never diagnosed, but people around me have told me that I have some characteristics of someone whom is OCD. I've gotten better at controlling it which has makes my wife's life a bit less stressful. I don't get bent out of shape as much anymore if the house is in complete disarray; oh it bothers me, but I try to redirect my energy elsewhere to be more productive. Well that's all for now.
Now 72 I was diagnosed early 1999 and had a 6 year honeymoon but now getting difficult (freezing, pain, sleep deficit etc ) and have adopted an Aged care hostel, a good one. However, the other people here (two only) who have PD are much worse than i (as i see them) i came across the following "ln the advanced stage of disease, the Advanced Care directive takes on an active role. The patient, family or proxy, and healthcare provider should intermittently review the advance directives as to the patient's wishes about pain management, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, bowel disorders, artificial hydration, artificial … dementia, agitation, nutrition, and restlessness. ... so it seems to me the last year or two of living with PD is as challenging/difficult as some types of cancer, HIV or … I started writing PEACE CALLS in honour of a proper "Dying with Dignity" policy, which does not yet apply in Australia, and to reflect my ecological perspective Peace Calls
Like everything else, I could be weeks, months, or possibly even years late on this. Well, probably not years, because as far as I can tell, this is something new for 2008. I'm referring to a new promotion Topps is going to roll out for their football products in 2008, called Topps Player Collection. The gist of it is that the 30 best players will be found on the same checklist numbers in every Topps NFL set for 2008. It's an interesting idea, and you have to think that if it tests positive with dealers and collectors, something like this will end up as the practice for other sports. The problem I see with it carrying over to other sports is that it throws off the meritocratic checklisting system Topps baseball really just put back into circulation. Let's say Albert Pujols is #500 in 2009 Topps. Does this mean that every Topps baseball set will have at least 500 cards? Or is it much more likely that cards #1 through #30 are super stars? Also, here's a great piece by Tyler Kepner in today's New York Times about major leaguers and their fantasy football teams.
I'm having a rare asthma flare up today. The reason is because I hired someone to make a new bedroom in the basement for my son, and all the sawdust, and dust mites being spewed up through the vents is killing me. Well, it probably doesn't help that I've been cleaning the upstairs bedrooms, but that's done now. Keep in mind I'm not as bad as I would be if I weren't on all these great new controller meds, although I can definitely notice my early warning signs: 1. Tight chest 2. Itching feeling in neck area 3. exhaustion 4. Urge to sneeze 5. Nasal congestion 6. Runny nose 7. gut feeling 8. Ventolin isn't working 9. Can smell all the allergins in the air (a unique skill I have. More on this later) Now, I've been meaning to talk about this for a while, but my asthma is unique in that no matter how I feel my peak flows do not change. For example, I just blew into my peak flow meter, and my PEFR was 690. Keep in mind my personal best is 730, so 690 puts me right in my normal range.
I currently find myself in a much better place than where I was a week ago. Sure, the pain is still there – but it is neither as intense nor as constant as it was just a few days ago. Up until a few months ago, when I was in this same situation, I would have still been struggling for the pain to go away completely. Even though the worst of the flare had subsided, my feelings of anger and sadness would continue to grow. I (mistakenly) believed that I could not be happy until my rheumatoid arthritis went away completely. Now, if the pain is somewhat moderate and focused on only a few joints, I find this a blessing. Better yet, I find myself at peace…and happy. Just yesterday, when I was at physical therapy, my therapist and I were talking at how well I handled this latest flare. Sure, there were a few moments when the pain seemed too much to bear…but as soon as they passed, I got back on track and focused more on doing the things that I needed to do to take care of myself.
Welcome to everyone to ACL! It's pretty rare for me to end up conferencing in a country I've been before, largely because I try to avoid it. When I was here last time, I stayed with Yee Whye, who was here at the time as a postdoc at NUS, and lived here previously in his youth. As a result, he was an excellent "tour guide." With his help, here's a list of mostly food related stuff that you should definitely try while here (see also the ACL blog): Pepper crab. The easiest to find are the "No Signboard" restaurant chain. Don't wear a nice shirt unless you plan on doing laundry. Chicken rice. This sounds lame. Sure, chicken is kind of tasty. Rice is kind of tasty. But the key is that the rice is cooked in or with melted chicken fat. It's probably the most amazingly simple and delicious dish I've ever had. "Yet Kun" (or something like that) is along Purvis street. Especially for dessert, there's Ah Chew, a Chinese place around Liang Seah street in the Bugis area (lots of other stuff there too). Hotpot is another local specialty: there is very good spicy Szechuan hotpot around Liang Seah street. For real Chinese tea, here. (Funny aside: when I did this, they first asked "have you had tea before?" Clearly the meaning is "have you had real Chinese tea prepared traditionally and tasted akin to a wine tasting?" But I don't think I would ever ask someone "have you had wine before?" But I also can't really think of a better way to ask this!) Good late night snacks can be found at Prata stalls (eg., indian roti with curry). The food court at Vivocity, despite being a food court, is very good. You should have some hand-pressed sugar cane juice -- very sweet, but very tasty (goes well with some spicy hotpot). Chinatown has good Chinese dessert (eg., bean stuff) and frog leg porridge.
The College Baseball Blog continues our weekly awards today by honoring Florida International outfielder Jabari Henry and Texas RHP Taylor Jungmann. In five games last week, Henry went 9-for-18 for a .500 batting average and a 1.389 slugging percentage. Over the five games, he hit five home runs, two of which were grand slams, registered 17 RBI, scored nine runs and totaled 25 bases. He had multi-home run games in two of the five games. He also drew three walks, stole two bases and threw a runner out from left field trying to stretch a single into a double at second base. Jungmann was outstanding on Friday night as he pitched 7.1 innings while giving up a first inning run. He ended up giving up five hits and walking only one hitter. His most impressive stat was the fact he recorded 17 strikeouts in a possible 22 outs as the Iowa Hawkeyes struggled to find a rhythm. The 17 strikeouts was a career-high and fell just two short of the school record set by Burt Hooton in a 13-inning game against Texas Tech in 1971 and tied by Eric Stone in a nine inning game against Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana-Lafayette) in 1998.
So, what I'd like someone to do is to argue to my why consistency is actually a desirable property. I can come up with lots of other examples. One reason why this invariance is bad is because it renders the notion of "reference sizes" irrelevant. This is of course a problem if you have prior knowledge (eg., one thing measured in millimeters, the other in kilometers). But even in the case where you don't know knowledge, what you can do is take the following. Take data generated by thousands of well separated Gaussians, so that the clearly right thing to do is have one cluster per Gaussian. Now, for each of these clusters except for one, shrink them down to single points. This is possible by consistency. Now, your data basically looks like thousands-1 of clusters with zero inter-cluster distances and then one cluster that's spread out. But now it seems that the reasonable thing is to put each data point that was in this old cluster into its own cluster, essentially because I feel like the other data shows you what clusters should look like. If you're not happy with this, apply scaling and push these points out super far from each other. (I don't think this example is as compelling as the one I drew in pictures, but I still think it's reasonable. Now, in the UAI paper this year, they show that if you fix the number of clusters, these axioms are now consistent. (Perhaps this has to do with the fact that all of my "weird" examples change the number of clusters -- though frankly I don't think this is necessary... I probably could have arranged it so that the resulting green and blue clusters look like a single line that maybe should just be one cluster by itself.) But I still feel like consistency isn't even something we want.
Performance at a default setting of the hyperparameter. For instance, SVM-light uses something like average inverse norm of the data vectors as the C parameter. Or you could just us 1, like I do for logreg. In particular, suppose you're testing your algorithm on 20 data sets from UCI. Pick a single regularization parameter (or parameter selection scheme, ala SVM-light) to use for all of them and report results using that value. If this is about the same as the "I carefully tuned" setting, I'm happy. If it's way worse, I'm not so happy. Performance within a range. Let's say that if I do careful hyperparameter selection then I get an accuracy of X. How large is the range of hyperparameters for which my accuracy is at least X*0.95? I.e., if I'm willing to suffer 5% multiplicative loss, how lazy can I be about hp selection? For this, you'll probably need to grid out your performance and then do empirical integration to approximate this. Of course, you'll need to choose a bounded range for your hp (usually zero will be a lower bound, but you'll have to pick an upper bound, too -- but this is fine: as a practitioner, if you don't give me an upper bound, I'm going to be somewhat unhappy). Neither of these is totally ideal, but I think they'd be a lot better than the current situation of really having no idea! Maybe there are other proposals out there that I don't know about, or maybe other readers have good ideas. But for me, if you're going to convince me to switch to your algorithm, this is something that I really really want to know. (As an aside, Mark, if you're reading this, I can imagine the whole CW thing getting a bit confused if you're using feature hashing: have you tried this? Or has someone else?)
We just need to make sure that around home we keep our expectations of him high. I think I baby him and don’t push him and that certainly is not doing him any favors. So I’m working on that!
I have had CTS for 15 years and it is often aggravated by yard work (rake & shovel are worst) more than computer work, even though I work on a keyboard all day. After a hard day of work in the yard I find that icing the top & bottom of my wrists for about 45 mins per side can really help. I keep the ice on one spot for 10-15 mins, then move it to the other side of the same wrist, and repeat until the 45 mins are up. Then I'll do the other hand/wrist. I do the icing routine right after I finish in the yard, and then again the next morning when I get up. All that being said, I am getting close to the point of being unable to keep the CTS at bay through reducing yard work and icing. Steroid shots in the wrist broke a couple of really bad cycles for me as well, but I am close to taking the advice from my friends who've had the surgery and are now symptom-less, and just getting the thing done...
 I really enjoyed Mark Dredze's talk at EMNLP on multiclass confidence weighted algorithms, where they take their CW binary predictors and extend them in two (basically equivalent) ways to a multiclass/structured setting (warning: I haven't read the paper!). Mark did a great job presenting, as always, and dryly suggested that we should all throw away our perceptrons and our MIRAs and SVMs and just switch to CW permanently. It was a pretty compelling case. Now, I'm going to pick on basically every "yet another classifier" paper I've read in the past ten years (read: ever). I'm not trying to point fingers, but just try to better understand why I, personally, haven't yet switched to using these things and continue to use either logistic regression or averaged perceptron for all of my classification needs (aside from the fact that I am rather fond of a particular software package for doing these things -- note, though, that it does support PA and maybe soon CW if I decide to spend 10 minutes implementing it!). Here's the deal. Let's look at SVM versus logreg. Whether this is actually true or not, I have this gut feeling that logreg is much less sensitive to hyperparameter selection than are SVMs. This is not at all based on any science, and the experience that it's based on it somewhat unfair (comparing megam to libSVM, for instance, which use very different optimization methods, and libSVM doesn't do early stopping while megam does). However, I've heard from at least two other people that they have the same internal feelings. In other words, here's a caricature of how I believe logreg and SVM behave:
I haven't purchased a pack or any single cards from a Topps Heritage product in over two years (the last one I collected was Heritage '59, in 2008). I did this for a variety of reasons, most notably because I just didn't have the income to justify collecting another new set. I also stood (and continue to stand) firmly in the belief that the Heritage brand should've ended with the Heritage '59 (2008) set, and that Topps should've rechristened the subsequent sets as "Topps Classic." In any event, I've been thinking about this year's Heritage ('61), and I think I've hit upon a way to make the brand more appealing. The Heritage checklister has done an admirable job "updating" checklists from the original sets and filling in each spot with its twenty-first century player equivalent. They haven't gotten everything right (as an homage to 1960's card #1, Cy Young-winner Early Wynn of the White Sox, 2009's card #1 was Mark Buerhle of the White Sox; it should have been one of the reigning Cy Young winners, Cliff Lee or Tim Lincecum), but 100% accuracy is not something any card company should be expected to achieve. But a sly wink and an inside joke to an original checklist is no longer enough to buoy a set. The company has to continue to push the envelope or else they'll begin to lose the audience, or make them cynical about the checklisting tactics used ("Thom" Glavine, anyone? How about those annoying black backs versus green backs from the Heritage '59 set?). The next logical step is the photo homage. Not just one or two photos sprinkled over the checklist, either. If they made every photograph on every card an homage to its checklist buddy from the original set, that would be something to write home about, something that would elevate the Heritage brand out of the retro-design doldrums. Of course, to accomplish this, the Topps photographers would have to actually study the original set and pose their subjects down to the minutest detail. They'd also have to shoot their photos with an idea of recreating the photographic standards of the 1960s. Presumably, color-correcting of this caliber is something that Adobe Photoshop could assist in accomplishing. I've never been a huge fan of the 1961 set. I think the design is one of Topps' weakest of the decade and the era, and the photos fairly unimaginative. Really, the only great part of the set are the subsets (the Brady Bunch-esque League Leaders, the MVPs, the All-Stars, the combo cards — "Lindy Shows Larry", anyone? — the World Series cards, and the Historical Highlights), an idea that exploded in 1961 and came to dominate the Topps Sixties. It would be great to get "Josh Shows Daisuke" in my pack of Heritage '61 and not have it be two silhouetted shots of the individuals placed near each other. I'd appreciate the homage much more if Josh Beckett was smiling awkwardly while showing Daisuke Matsuzaka how to throw a curve.
That is, if you really tune the regularizer (lambda) well, then SVMs will win out. But for the majority of the settings, they're either the same or logreg is a bit better. As a result, what do I do? I use logreg with lambda=1. That's it. No tuning, no nothing. (Note that, as I said before, I haven't ever run experiments to verify this. I think it would be a moderately interesting thing to try to see if it really holds up when all else -- eg., the optimization algorithm, early stopping, implementation, choice of regularizer (L1, L2, KL, etc.), and so on -- are held constant... maybe it's not true. But if it is, then it's an interesting theoretical question: hinge loss and log loss don't look that different, despite the fact that John seems to not like how log loss diverges: why should this be true?) This is also why I use averaged perceptron: there aren't any hyperparameters to select. It just runs. What I'd really like to see in future "yet another classifier" papers is an analysis of sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. You could provide graphs and stuff, but these get hard to read. I like numbers. I'd like a single number that I can look at. Here are two concrete proposals for what such a number could be (note: I'm assuming you're also going to provide performance numbers at the best possible selection of hyperparameters from development data or cross validation... I'm talking about something in addition):
Over the past year, there were many moments when I just wanted to be left alone. I didn't want to hear any type of advice. Words of encouragement were often transformed midair into little daggers that somehow made me feel worse instead of better. On top of struggling with a major progression of my rheumatoid arthritis, I was also having a difficult time accepting the full extent of my depression. And as is often the case with depression, my mind was constantly tricking itself into believing that I was more comfortable staying where I was, than trying to dig myself out of the emotional hole that I was in. “Too difficult”, “not possible” and “I can't” were phrases that all too often floated around in my head. So when helping hands were offered, I often found it much easier to snap at them. “I don't need help. I can help myself.” So true, yet so false at the same time. I could help myself…but I would need help in doing so. I started seeking the help that I needed.
For Christmas My Dad gave me some money so I bought a full size basketball net. I have been practising it nearly everyday and I can throw the ball a bit further now and more accurate. Next Topic is my hoodies, I always wear my hood for protection, (I feel safer when i wear it)apart from in shops where they will tell me to take it off again. So If people saw me in the street they would think Im a hoody who is going to get them but people who know me know different. I need to try and take off my hood more often. thanks for reading bye..
I enjoy good memoirs. At their best, they can give you a sense of what it would be like to lead a different life, to walk in another's shoes. Political memoirs are usually a disappointment, as the writers typically have an agenda, such as establishing a place in history or angling for the next job. They seem more like spin than truthful self-assessment. Memoirs by nerdy academics, rare as they are, are among my favorite, in part because I can easily see myself in them and in part because the authors are often brutally honest. All this is a prelude to a book recommendation: My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance, by Emanuel Derman. I have never been a physicist or worked on Wall Street, but this book gives a good sense of what both career paths are like. The book was written, by the way, before the recent financial crisis. As a result, one does not get a sense of how the author would put recent events into perspective. But by the end of the book, the author is skeptical enough about the use and abuse of financial models that I suspect he would not be terribly surprised when they went awry.
I've noticed lately that as they age, the one really noticeable place people gain weight is in the face. Even athletes, whose job it is to stay in impeccable shape. Just look at Tony Perez's Super Veterans card in 1983 Topps; he almost looks like two different people. I bring this up because the more I look back through all these cards of Fred McGriff, the more it appears that he didn't gain face weight. Can that be right? His helmet looked comically oversized even late into his career (whereas someone like Tony Gwynn filled out under his helmet). It's always shocking when you see an old retired athlete (take Larry Bird for example), because usually the first thing you think of is Hey, he really let himself go. And yet, take a look at this photo from a dinner in 2007. McGriff doesn't look like Rickey Henderson, but he also doesn't look like he stopped working out occasionally. Anyway, I didn't really want to talk about face fat. I wanted to talk about good old National Packtime. Take a look at the lineup of this little set from 1995: Alex Rodriguez Barry Bonds Cal Ripken Ken Griffey Jr. Tony Gwynn Frank Thomas Mike Piazza Will Clark Juan Gonzalez Jeff Bagwell Kenny Lofton Fred McGriff Deion Sanders Matt Williams Jose Canseco Bob Hamelin Tim Salmon Raul Mondesi You know, for all the future Hall of Famers and on-the-cusp guys in the set, the guy I was most excited by was Raul Mondesi. (You want to read something interesting? Read Mondesi's wikipedia page.) I still feel like Mondesi could, if he wanted to, get back into playing shape and make an impact on a team like Pittsburgh or Seattle. And I bet that with a few rigorous workouts, that face fat will leather itself taut. (Scroll down to the bottom of this page to see what Mondesi looks like now.)
Occasionally, there is no question that the couple is moving toward divorce, but know it will take some time to work everything out. If their incomes are substantially different, it may be worth agreeing on a written separation agreement; that way the person paying any alimony can deduct it on his or her tax return. The paying spouse might be able to pay the receiving spouse more than enough to pay the tax on the alimony, and still come out ahead. Sometimes one of the spouses has a religious objection to divorce. A formal separation will allow the spouses to remain officially married even as they live separate lives.
In Thailand, when the captain of a boat says the weather is too dangerous to carry on, he starts laughing. Thats when I started worrying.Thailand's coast was far away behind us and the nearest real land was Burma to our Starboard - which is on the righthand side for you landlubbers. A looming grey cloud piled up over Burma and another storm was rolling in from the sea ahead, which is the Fore. Or the Stern. But it didn't matter right now, as the captain was looking very stern himself.
There are also many reasons why people stay together, even though they know that they should really end the relationship. Sometimes one partner makes the other feel guilty about leaving and manipulates them into staying in the relationship. If you feel within your heart that the relationship is over, then you should do what's right for you without any feelings of guilt about the relationship.
Alongside work, I spent time with my old host family and other friends, both volunteers and not. I had Chinese food, tasty beer and hot running water. But it was at home, relaxing with my family back in Naryn, that I was truly caught off guard. Upon inspection of a persistent scratching in my luggage, I found a mouse had made a home in an old deodorant tube with my toilet paper rations, and was living quite happily off of my emergency Cliff Bars. As a testament to that company, folks, he sure was hard to catch.
Packed into a small minivan I exchanged uncomfortable looks with 10 other foreign tourists as we sped away from the train station and glided easily onto Singapore’s well oiled highway. The cute girl in the station helpfully offered advice on a free bus service to the Singapore Zoo. A few minutes later I was paying a complete stranger money for an entrance ticket to the Night Safari in exchange for a free ride. “You don’t have a sign on the van, man,” a young pseudo backpacker announced from the sidewalk. His mother looked uncomfortable. “You guys are getting ripped off,” he yelled as the door slammed shut and we sped away.
I grew up in Oxfordshire, England. From 1995 - 1997 (age 11 - 13) my father worked in Oman and I spent around 8 months there visiting him. Until 1970 the country had been ruled by a Sultan who banned anything modern or Western from roads to electricity to medecine to spectacles. By the time I got there most of it was only accessible by terrible dirt tracks and we spent much of our free time exploring the rugged interior by 4WD, on foot and even by camel. Experiences such as being invited into a one-room mud hut in an isolated mountain village and visiting a Bedouin camel market on the edge of the desert left an indelible impression on me and a thirst for more exotica.
yes I believe it is because us guys have Testosterone which makes us more active and so we burn off fat by eating and exercising I was really skinny as a kid because I could go play until I finished my food so shoveled my food so I could play and I burned off the food before it had time to become fat
I lost my mother to radical breast cancer which kept spreading throughout her body. She had five different operations and chemo therapy before she died. I just had radical prostate surgery a week ago Tuesday and today found out there is a 30% chance there is still some left but need to wait 6 weeks to see where we are. I have high hopes as I have 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson who are very concerned. We are keeping them informed and positive. I hope this is what you are looking for.
I certainly hope AIPAC comes to its senses soon. But I suspect it wants a showdown with the Obama Administration, which, unlike its Bush predecessor, has stood with the rest of the world in requesting that Israel adhere to Road Map laid out by the so-called quartet (the U.S., E.U., U.N. and Russia), a plan the West Bank Palestinians seem to be taking seriously. This is an attempt by AIPAC to show muscle and force the Obama Administration to back down: Israel has tremendous support in the United States, especially among Evangelicals (who believe that the achievement of a Greater Israel--that is, the annexation of Palestinian lands--would be a precursor of the Rapture).
Just like people, some dogs have a sensitive stomach or will even vomit on an empty stomach. As long as the dog is eating, drinking, acting normally, exhibiting no other signs of illness, and showing no increase in frequency of the vomiting, there is typically no reason to worry. Always consult your vet if your dog's vomiting is chronic, continues for more than a day, or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as weight loss, decreased appetite, diarrhea, or excessive water intake.
If your ex-spouse keeps throwing up roadblocks to your recovery or the recovery of your children, you're probably about to lose your mind. Believe it or not, more often than not, the roadblocks are either unintentional or unconscious if not both.
But listening only goes so far when you're trying to work out problems in you relationship. If you do not really understand where they are coming from, you might be creating more problems. When they are expressing themselves, you want to ask questions when appropriate in order to clarify what they are saying to you. Even if it seems uncomfortable at first, it's important that you make sure that you understand where they are at and how you might be able to help.
Even after years of working with divorcees, I am amazed at how often one party sets themselves up for conflict with their approach. It is very easy to put the other person on the defensive with your words or tone. No one wants to be wrong in divorce. In fact, admitting that your wrong would suggest weakness and the divorce system is not set up to tolerate weakness from anyone. So, you should not expect your ex to admit he or she is wrong, bad, difficult, stupid, or any other negative quality.
Kosovo maintains a border station into Serbia, while Serbia maintains a police checkpoint a few kilometers later  to catch visa violators.  If you entered Kosovo first, received a Kosovar entry and exit stamp, and then try to enter Serbia you will be denied access. Good luck finding your way back to Pristina. Serbia considers Kosovo a part of Serbian territory and if you enter it without a Serbian entry visa you are technically without a valid visa. As a matter of principle, Serbian visa stamps are not available along the Kosovar/Serbian border as there are only police checkpoints to make sure you have one.
The problem with universal health care is there inevitably becomes a huge backlog of patients waiting for surgery to be approved and there is the tendancy to use less expensive methods of treatment which can and often does, does nothing for the patient. (cancer treatments, heart, hiv/aids etc...)
While you don't have to become legally separated to do this, taking time away from each other is one of the best ways to stop a marriage from becoming a divorced marriage. When you take time away from each other, you allow yourself to have a new perspective on the events that are happening. And this can allow you to see new solutions as well as new ideas for how to handle the problems that you may be having. Even if it's just a night or a few hours, taking time to step back from an issue can help it become easier to resolve.
One of the best ways to help save your marriage is to start creating long term plans with your partner. While this might not seem like the best idea at the time, it will create the idea that you are both going to make it through the rough patch that you have stumbled upon - somehow. Try to make plans for vacations or other far in the future appointments. This will create a little less pressure because the future isn't so vague and unable to be seen in the dark that you are experiencing at the time.
Don't expect to put chemicals in your body and expect to stay healthy. There's enough chemicals in the air and in the water as it is. Remember we're living in a chemical world of industrialization and profit. If you want to help clean your body try some prunes or lots of watermelon it tastes good or load up on live digestive enzymes.
Michael Scherer tells me that Obama aides expect that the president will meet with Senate and House Dems at some point this week. Not sure where or when -- I just put it in here as there was nothing else going on Wednesday and it seemed the most likely date.
There's nothing more damaging to a relationship than a partner that doesn't take the time to listen. In fact, that fact alone might be the thing that has led to the feelings of dissatisfaction with a marriage. In order to be a good partner (on either end), you need to be able to remain quiet and talk through problems until both partners are satisfied. Be quiet when they are speaking and try to really listen to what they are saying.
C-SPAN junkies rejoice -- the indispensable cable chroniclers have put just about every minute they've ever recorded online with full search functionality. That's 160,000+ hours going back more than 20 years! Though it will surely be a useful tool for studying history and exposing hypocrisy, we get the added bonus of being able to dig up videos and photos of our colleagues from the early '90s:
While having a quaint town to retreat to after a long day on the slopes is important, the main attraction is the skiing itself. Bansko boasts modern lifts and facilities (rare in the region) and has a wide range of trails that will keep beginners to experts happy. A fresh blanket of powder awaited us on our first day which proved nicer conditions than our trip to the Dolomites in Italy. Though to be fair, the selection of rental equipment is not friendly to the advanced skier. Bring your own if you are picky.
We were on holiday recently and my partner was navigating. It was dark and she wasn't really sure of where we were or how to get to our destination. On several occasions I was tempted to ridicule her efforts to find her way and laugh outright at her method of navigating.
Long ago are the dates that began at the fanciest restaurant in town and ended with a balcony seat at the opera. As society becomes more budget-minded and people struggle to get out of debt from credits cards, mortgages and school loans, there lies a need for frugal alternatives to the romantic date. Short of forcing your date to eat your leftover pizza from last night and watching a re-run of a sitcom, what other budget-minded options are out there?
Our Cancer will be a new experience for many of you, so we realize it may take some practice. Feel free to post comments to the blog if you have any questions on how it works, and we'll do our best to help you out. Meanwhile, we encourage you to start discussions on things you care about. You're the experts in your own experiences in Cancer World, so we're hoping you'll take the lead in sharing your stories so others can benefit from your wisdom.
While you might be upset about the way that things have turned out, you need to remember that being calm is the best way to see things more clearly. Try lowering your voice when you talk - it automatically lowers your blood pressure and your anger. Try to take a few deep breaths before you say anything - this will help you to be clear and calm as you speak. Many people perceive becoming flustered or upset as being angry, and that can lead to a poor environment for working through issues.
Beyond that, there may not be much of a reason to go through the time, pain, and expense of a formal legal separation. Better perhaps to agree to reach a working arrangement for an informal separation. You can then follow it up directly with either reconciliation or divorce. So, can separation save a marriage - that is the question. Some people strenuously resist separation, thus adding even more stress into an already tense marriage. Perhaps separation may be the best option for some marriages, despite the looming shadow of divorce, as living together is obviously is not working. However, can you make it work from a distance? A trial separation will go a long way in helping you decide the answer.
There should be caps put into place on the Doctors, Hospitals, and Pharmaceuticals for what they can charge. Maybe the government should put a stop to the AMA and the Pharmaceutical companies from using a lot of their money and influence for lobbying in D.C. in order to keep the prices practically out of reach for the average American. It is becoming increasingly ridiculous in this country that our government is practically allowing corporate America to intentionally get away with breaking the finances of the working class American.
My own personal is opinion is that the health care system is about how can make the most money. Health care, insurance, prescriptions, nursing homes are costing more and more every year and if you are lucky enough to have insurance the coverage is decreasing. What we need to do is start thinking about our citizens and not the bottom line. Many problems in this country stems from health care. We need to make insurance affordable for employers so they can make it affordable for their employees. One idea I like is being able to bank money that would initially go to insurance if you was to need it but if you don't use it would work like a savings account. There is alot of problems with health care and many other things in this country and hopefully the next person in charge of these problems will be able to conduct a plan that thinks about the middle class and the poor and not the rich lobbiest and drug companies.
I don't care how good your relationship is with your ex-spouse, with few exceptions, there are going to be periods of time when you just don't see eye to eye. And you know what? That's a normal part of the process, and if you agreed on everything, you probably wouldn't have split up in the first place. But, that's a topic for another time.
I'm so glad I didn't! She did find her way eventually and I had a fantastic time on my surprise weekend away. She even apologised (after some time had passed!), for the lengthy detour. I guarantee that none of that would have happened if I'd made her feel stupid.
The America-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has done a very unwise thing: It has issued a statement criticizing the Obama Administration, rather than Israel, for its reaction to the Netanyahu government's recent announcement of more illegal settlement blocks in East Jerusalem--an announcement that was made during Vice President Joe Biden's visit last week, an act of extreme rudeness on top of its unquestioned illegality.
The new Our Cancer community has been live for less than 24 hours and I'm happy to report that people are beginning to use it. As of this morning, around 50 of you have joined the group, and a number of you have started posting introductions about yourselves.
Any veteran observer of Congress is used to the rampant hypocrisy over the use of parliamentary procedures that shifts totally from one side to the other as a majority moves to minority status, and vice versa. But I can't recall a level of feigned indignation nearly as great as what we are seeing now from congressional Republicans and their acolytes at the Wall Street Journal, and on blogs, talk radio, and cable news. It reached a ridiculous level of misinformation and disinformation over the use of reconciliation, and now threatens to top that level over the projected use of a self-executing rule by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the last Congress that Republicans controlled, from 2005 to 2006, Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier used the self-executing rule more than 35 times, and was no stranger to the concept of “deem and pass.” That strategy, then decried by the House Democrats who are now using it, and now being called unconstitutional by WSJ editorialists, was defended by House Republicans in court (and upheld). Dreier used it for a $40 billion deficit reduction package so that his fellow GOPers could avoid an embarrassing vote on immigration. I don't like self-executing rules by either party—I prefer the “regular order”—so I am not going to say this is a great idea by the Democrats. But even so—is there no shame anymore?
Bleach is a form of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (lye water). These two substances will kill your intestinal flora that is 3/4 of your immune system. Just drinking chlorinated tap water or even worse, fluoridated tap water, you will greatly harm your immune system. It will have the opposite effect of what you are trying to do. Allopathic medicine has put us all in great harm by following the kill the germ idea to make us healthy.   To properly cleanse your body, you should find a good certified nutritional therapist that understands QRA to help you.

Singapore is a gastronomic paradise to suit any budget. In a city that can quickly put pressure on your wallet from accommodation to shopping, food is the one area where you can splurge for cheap. Throughout the city, street stalls have been collected and thrown together into outside eateries offering Chinese, Indian, Singaporean (whatever that means) and general Southeast Asian fare. Or you can head down to the Muslim district and eat Murtabak Prata in one of the many shops.
Day 308 - Cradle Valley to Devonport Crikey, who flew us back to the UK without us knowing! It’s flipping, blinking freezing here this morning. Brrrrrgggggghhhhhhh. Even a hot shower doesn’t manage to warm the cockles but it’s not windy like it was yesterday so that’s a blessing. Hopefully everyone out on the Overland Track will be snug from thermal clothing if nothing else. . Today is our last day with Tony & Jane, in Tasmania anyway. They don’t leave the state until Wednesday night but we’re catching a ferry back to the mainland in the morning so are heading back
You may be questioning why I even bothered to go back to Singapore at all. This time I was routed through Singapore to wait for a visa while on a work trip to Timor-Leste and then Sri Lanka. As you can see I have a bias for rougher countries, but I was determined to make the best of my work funded stopover. As a result I give you my short list to making Singapore an interesting place.
Thoughts of self survival were in my mind, so I eyed up the crew onboard for possible cannibalistic mealtimes. The old-time hippy guy who i chatted to earlier had annoyed me with his insight that the island was busy now, too many visitors and the locals just rip people off but I figured that his island knowledge would be useful. Plus, the three chunky German girls with sarongs, sunburn and supersized rucksacks looked promising - definitely more meat on them than the vegetarian hippy...
The two-calendar-day reporting time expires and the Rules Committee can take up the bill. Traditionally, a rule takes one calendar day to ripen but past leaders both Republican and Democrat have gotten around that by including in the rule a provision that essentially declares that same day a whole new day (yes, this is White Rabbit time they'd be observing). If Speaker Pelosi chooses to she can bring up the vote Thursday, but again, she'll need time to whip members so a vote on Friday or Saturday is more likely.
When you visit Our Cancer for the first time, you'll find some things that are familiar, but largely it will be a new experience for most of you. Up until now, we've interacted through the blog, which meant that Leroy or Laurie would write a post, and then the rest of us would respond, having a conversation in the comment threads. With Our Cancer, things will be different, as all of you will be able to start your own conversations. Each one of you will be able to post blog entries and start discussion threads. You can even upload a photo or video clip and have people discuss it, or share an event listing with everyone. If you've ever used Facebook, it's kind of like what's known there as a Facebook Group. It's a place where all of us can take the lead and begin conversations that are important to us.
The Night Safari is something special. Showcasing nocturnal animals that sleep during normal zoo daytime hours, the dense humid surrounding jungle pulls you right into the safari experience. Take a train or walk the various paths past tigers, rhinos, deer, flying squirrels and hundreds of others.
As i was considering that Germany has had its fair share of cannibals recently and so maybe the German girls may know some good recipes, the boat steered toward the mangrove trees and amazingly a small channel opened up in them - a gap barely wider than the boat was long and studded with brown, decaying teeth of rocks that were gnashing at us, foaming the water and making me feel like this island was laughing at us. Evilly.
We turned to the left, or Port side, for land, which was a useless phrase right now as there was no port, just a bay of rocks, mangrove and the thick jungle of the tip of Koh Chang.
If you have children then this becomes an additional dimension to consider. It's generally better for children to grow-up in a family with their parents in the same house. The exception to this is when there's an environment of abuse, danger or emotional stress. Before you decide to walk out on your wife and kids, consider the children and whether it's possible to resolve your differences. Only if that's absolutely impossible and the family environment is worse if you stay together than if you split up, should you even consider leaving.
In a healthy relationship we are always doing kind and thoughtful gestures for our partner or spouse. It may be making them a cup of tea in the morning, leaving the heater on in the bathroom, running an errand or picking up the dry cleaning. The list is endless and I encourage you to take some time to think of the kind and thoughtful gestures your special someone does for you, as they are often overlooked and go un-thanked. By taking some time to notice the things they do you can easily rectify this with a thank you, a hug or some other acknowledgement.
Why? Because couples who separate tend to find that without the constant daily conflict and bickering the lack of proximity to their spouse provides time to think, and solve problems. Marital problems are often hard to resolve as they often get stalled by egos, fear and stubbornness. Resolution can flourish as long as at least one partner is willing to keep trying; if the urge to always be right and not back down remains then it probably means that the separation will end in divorce.
Another issue is the distance to the slopes from the center of town. While having the slopes at the higher altitudes does wonders for the snow conditions, access is a big problem. Only one gondola ferries skiers to the beginning of the slopes and the traffic jams are intense. Be prepared to fight your way into the cars. As we were putting our skies in the outside holders two others snuck in before us. After waiting in line for an hour we weren’t impressed with the local hospitality. The gondola opens at 8:30 am so if you don’t want to wait for an hour or longer get there early, and bring some muscle.
Make it more accessible for people so they do not have to lie about their situation. For example an unmarried pregnant female has a nice car, nice appt. and is in school but her job is a private nanny and therefor has no health insurance. In order for her to receive health care she would have to sell her car and downgrade her appt. before she can be accepted.
In Autumn 2007 I moved to Russia and began teaching English. Working crazy hours for good pay I was able to save up enough money after 9 months to travel for a year. The beginning of that year is where this blog begins. After that year of traveling I returned to Russia, where I am now, to do the same thing again.
Between snow-melt and rain, Bishkek was a grim portent of what spring will be like in Naryn, whenever it finally decides to come. Mud mud mud was the name of the game. Bishkek has plenty more paved roads than in Sunny Naryn, and that bodes poorly for what extremes our mud situation might entail. The high mountains of snow excavated from the neighbor’s driveways and yards leaves me fearful as to how my shoes, socks and pant-cuffs will survive. Thankfully though, that trial is still months away.
Every time I travel through Singapore I am disappointed. Compared to the surrounding countries Singapore is a bland wasteland of identical shopping malls and artificially created tourist attractions. It lacks the gritty cultural depth filling the cracks of its less prosperous neighbors. A bold statement? Indeed, but one backed up by countless uninspiring trips through the small city state. For the first time visitor to Asia, Singapore is a great stepping stone to getting acclimated to this diverse area of the world. But for the experienced Asia hand it can easily turn into an exercise of waiting for the water to boil as the seconds tick by and time stretches out.
The neoconservatives who worship General David Petraeus may not be too pleased with this--a briefing Petraeus prepared for his boss, Admiral Mike Mullen, on the regional problems being raised by Israel's instransigence on the settlements issue. If Israel were taking a moral position that upset the regional Arabs, like defending its right to exist (a limited strike in self-defense against the Hamas rocketers in Gaza, for example), I'd say that Arab disapproval would be a geo-strategic cost that we, as Israel's ally, would have to live with.
Hi Sarimah, I am watching the show and you did a great job. Answering you questions, well, this is because of the muscle mass that basically guys having higher muscle mass compared to women. 1kg of muscle will burns approximately 31 calories (without exercise) that we call BMR-Basal Metabolic Rate. More muscle means more fat burnt. The second things is, during exercising, guys will use more energy than women does. Says weight lifting. Guys can bring up 30KG weight, but women maybe 10KG. Means that guys will burn more calories because they use more energy compared to women.
I find it striking that so many people have answered "yes" followed with "because men have more muscle mass". But WHY do men have more muscle mass? It all boils down to hormones. Women produce more estrogen than men, and what bit men do produce is filtered out via the liver. Estrogen is known as "the fat storing hormone". It's what gives women hips and breasts and makes our skin soft and smooth. Testosterone (which women DO produce in small amounts), lends itself to the building UP of muscle mass and the tearing DOWN of fat. This is why you see so many female (well, and male) bodybuilders abusing anabolic steroids. Anabolic steroids are a synthetic form of testosterone. This abuse not only allows the woman to rid her body of fat quicker (too much so - most will no longer menstruate due to lack of sufficient body fat - another reason we women produce estrogen), and also to build up muscle MUCH quicker than at a normal rate. The more muscle one has, the faster he or she will burn fat, even at rest.
Just when I thought I could relax a bit and enjoy the Christmas season, I get more bad news. For every cancer patient, this can happen at the worst of times. But for a disease that seems to attack indiscriminately, there's no reason to expect it to honor holidays.
This time it wasn't a complete surprise as I have been experiencing new pain in my lower right back which has been getting steadily worse almost every day.  Initial scans had shown nothing, but my PSA was up again so I knew something was happening.  When I found out last week that it had quadrupled in 4 weeks, it confirmed that the cancer was actively spreading again (and growing tumours or lesions).  It seems that once it starts up, it moves very fast.  I can only try to slow it down with hormones, but I can't use the same ones as before (which rendered me bed-ridden) so it will be "sub-optimal treatment" as my oncologist says.
Forgiving infidelity is a difficult choice to make. Many people find it easier to disconnect from the cheater and heal alone. Forgiving infidelity involves strength and guidance, because infidelity often attacks a person's self esteem. Working through feelings of anger, hurt and betrayal are essential before the forgiving process can begin. There is help available for forgiving infidelity. Here are a few tips.
Any universal health care system will have to be two fold. Public and private. Privately insured and government funded. The government funded would have to have some form of bulk billing by doctors and hospitals to keep the overall cost down. Services would have to be combined as well wherever possible to prevent double billing. ie... seeing a GP for a problem then being referred to a specialist, then having to return to the GP for further direction. And of course, no universal health care would be effective unless it included dental coverage as many health problems are related to poor oral care. The major drug manufacturing companies have to be on board as well if this were to succeed.
I lost my nanny to cancer when I was in Primary School, we were so close. She went from being so fit, looking after 3 grand children, collecting (WALKING) them from the primary school every day, with me in the pram, when all of a sudden me and her were shopping when she collapsed. I remember that day, she was coughing up blood. But what was I to do? I was like 4/5/6. I thought nothing of it. The rest was a blur but I do have a slight memory of seeing her in Marie Curie. She died on New Years Eve/ perhaps Day.
So this Christmas will mix friends, family and fun with scans, doctors and meds.   These kinds of choices are tough enough but they can certainly cast a pall over a happy season.  So that's my challenge - to deal with all of this without letting it ruin my holiday.  We have a wonderful Christmas season planned with lots of family and friends and, while my situation will be on everyone's minds (because they love and care for me), I'm not going to let it take away from their enjoyment or mine.
PHOENIX — John McCain and Sarah Palin are scheduled to campaign together in Arizona next week for the first time since they conceded the presidential election in Phoenix in 2008.

On Dec. 20, we held an "exclusive" family and friends book launch for The Wolf at my Door.  Given the time of year, I was very pleased to have about 75 people attend.  My brother and good friend Gayla surprised we with humbling and heartfelt introductions and then I had a chance to read excerpts from the book.  It was an amazing day and incredibly emotional for everyone who attended.  Many people read the book over the next couple of days and I have received incredible feedback and requests for more copies.  Thank you to everyone who attended, with a special thanks to my daughter Caralia who arranged the event and to Meghan and Dayna who also helped.
Walk done the road, you might find something open. We are located in the center of town. Wow, that was unhelpful. The swank interior decorating of bright reds set on black and futuristic minimalistic Japanese inspired lines of the hotel lobby highlighted the staff’s unwillingness to get his image dirty with useful answers. This didn’t bode well for our stay. Luckily we were rescued by a perky eyed staff member who replaced her manager. We were pointed in the direction of a local tavern, one of many, and welcomed despite the late hour.
If you have a portable computer I'd recommend using Avast Anti-Virus with Windows Defender (install by default on Vista & Win7). Also make sure you keep update date with all system patches by using Windows Update (if using windows), or using the updater provided with Mac or Linux. You can get ClamAV for Linux, I don't really know what you could use for , I'm sure someone else could recommend for Mac :). As for a firewall I just rely on Avast (Free) to block intrusions on my laptop, normally picks them up well especially with its new silent firewall. Both Avast and ClamAV have free versions. I like the free Avast as well as it's not too intrusive in the way that it tries to advertise its paid versions unlike other AVs.
So why, I hear you ask, would anyone go through a formal legal separation? Maybe because some states require that a couple seeking a divorce have been separated for some period of time. Also, some couples need to remain legally married, perhaps so one can continue to be insured for medical or other purposes by the other's company. Formal legal separation makes this possible.
Divorcees are constantly trying to figure out the motives of the other party. But, too often there is no dialogue about why certain things are being said or done. When there is discussion about these things, the conversation often falls apart and escalates into an emotional fire storm. This can be particularly true in the early days. Frankly, it can get down right depressing.
Please also take note that I don't mean to offend anyone but merely to share my experiences (good and bad) - so please don't get all worked up by my entries - although constructive criticism is of course very welcome indeed! Having said that, I am not aiming to write a politically correct blog here. My writing is (naturally) highly subjective and expresses my (sometimes strong) opinions. Also, if you happen to be an American lawyer reading my entries: I take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever if someone chooses to somehow act based on any information in my blog.
Here is a simple a tip that can keep you from pulling your hair out. Before you approach your ex about a concern, write out a script along with possible replies from your ex. Then revise your script as many times as you possibly can until you are certain you are not taking an attacking, blaming, threatening, or condescending tone and approach. Really put your words to the test. Get honest about how you would respond to a similar approach. When you are sure you have the best possible script, memorize it and give it a go, but only when the timing is right.
