Following the death of the world's last Bo speaker (picture courtesy of BBC News) at the start of the month, the blogosphere was inundated with comments, questions and arguments about the importance of minority languages. To my dismay, a lot of people (many of whom seemed to hail from deepest inland US of A) seemed to think that language is nothing more than a method of communication. That the fewer languages the better. That, seeing as language is nothing more than a form of communication, why can't everybody just speak English?

As a linguist (albeit a poor one) I was saddened by these sorts of views. To reduce  language to the mere some of its parts, to a collection of words used to indicate something is to discount the awesome development of humankind. At the basest level of argument, language is what differentiates us from animals. At the highest, according to Jean-Jacques (not Henri) Rousseau, from its first moments of existence language has been the downfall of humanity from a pure and natural state and has a lot to bloody well answer for.
