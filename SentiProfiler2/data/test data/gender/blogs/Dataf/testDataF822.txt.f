I had in mind that Precious was a comedy film. It most definately is NOT. It does have some moments that will make you laugh, but this is a heavy film. Really heavy. But, it is a film that will make an impression and stick with you. Definately worth watching.Precious gets kicked out of school at age 16, because she is pregnant - yet again. She already went through this one time. So, the school farms her out to an alternative school.The alt school is a chance for a second chance, but the deck is really stacked against Precious.
