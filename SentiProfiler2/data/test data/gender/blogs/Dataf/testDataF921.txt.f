Yes, this is directed at all of the people who have ever said "FML" at a problem so minor as ruining their hair. & Yes, I AM NOT saying that I've never had a bad day, or something that I wish hadn't happened, or gotten mad over something miniscule. I have had MANY bad days, I have wished MULTIPLE times that things didn't happen, and I have gotten upset over tiny things too many times to even count. But the thing is, I'm starting to see how stupid all of that is. We are so lucky and we don't even realize it!!!! We could be in India, forced to hide under long black shawls and constantly told that men are and always will be better than us. We could be in Russia, a starving, toothless homeless child left to freeze out in the blizzarding snow. We could be in Africa, malnurished, infected with HIV/AIDS, and watching our children die before us, just waiting for our turn to come. I think that it is time that we ask ourselves, "Are our problems REALLY that big of a deal? Would we rather be doing seemingly pointless homework, or standing outside a schoolbuilding, yearning to be allowed to go inside but never getting the chance to? Does a ruined hairdo even compare  to a death-stricken family?"
For everyone reading this, I don't want you to ever think I'm a hypocrite if I ever accidentally complain about something that isn't that bad. I am human, I have lived in this well off town my entire life--I don't know anything different. I know for a fact that I WILL, sometime in the near future, be angry about something that I know in my heart I am lucky to have. But I am saying right now that I am making a conscious effort to be more grateful and appreciative of the things I've been blessed with, even when they don't seem like a blessing. All I have to do is think about the kids who don't have them, and how very blessed they would be if they did.
