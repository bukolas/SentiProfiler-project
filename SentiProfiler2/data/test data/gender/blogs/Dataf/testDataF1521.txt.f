How do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. So this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me.

but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. So my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? The current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.
