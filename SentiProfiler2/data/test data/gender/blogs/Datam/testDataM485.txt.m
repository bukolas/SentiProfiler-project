I find it striking that so many people have answered "yes" followed with "because men have more muscle mass". But WHY do men have more muscle mass? It all boils down to hormones. Women produce more estrogen than men, and what bit men do produce is filtered out via the liver. Estrogen is known as "the fat storing hormone". It's what gives women hips and breasts and makes our skin soft and smooth. Testosterone (which women DO produce in small amounts), lends itself to the building UP of muscle mass and the tearing DOWN of fat. This is why you see so many female (well, and male) bodybuilders abusing anabolic steroids. Anabolic steroids are a synthetic form of testosterone. This abuse not only allows the woman to rid her body of fat quicker (too much so - most will no longer menstruate due to lack of sufficient body fat - another reason we women produce estrogen), and also to build up muscle MUCH quicker than at a normal rate. The more muscle one has, the faster he or she will burn fat, even at rest.
