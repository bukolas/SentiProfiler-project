In the spirit of provident living we have several bags of hard red wheat stored away. Such a thing keeps for…probably forever, mostly because it is not easily used. So--just in case we ever had to survive on whole wheat I brought home a hand cranked flour mill. Our kitchen has one low counter for vertically challenged people—like me. The little mill attaches nicely there. It holds about three cups of grain.
