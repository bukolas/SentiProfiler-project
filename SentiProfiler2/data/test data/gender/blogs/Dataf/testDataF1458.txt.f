....I'm going on a rant for a few minutes....here's my issue.... I understand that there are a lot of dead beats out there who don't pay child support after their divorce. But when someone is actually trying.........and not just saying that they are.......then should they really get a lot of crap of not BEING ABLE to pay it?  They may be making a truck payment......just barely by the hair of their chinny chin chin.......but if they don't make the truck payment they can't work, and if they can't work there's no possible way of them ever getting caught up on child support. It's not like they're taking the meager amount of money they are getting an blowing it on anything meaningless. They're actually trying to pay bills and do the right thing. Besides being 400 behind isn't nearly as bad as being 1300 or more behind....like other people. The way I see it.....yes, child support is supposed to be paid...of course no one is arguing that....and there is no excuse for those who aren't even putting out the slightest bit of effort...but if someone is having a hard time...like the loss of a job and not getting anything in between but a few crap opportunities that wind up going nowhere....then shouldn't they be cut just A LITTLE SLACK? It's not like they lost their job because they stayed out all night drinking and couldn't wake up for work.....or decided to go to a bar instead of earning money.....maybe the company they worked for shit on them and they've had a hard time finding anything since. I think people should stop being so vindictive and appreciate the fact that their child actually has someone who is really trying to help support them and is busting their ass to try and make sure they will be able to catch up as soon as possible.  And if people are going to throw "I need to buy groceries for your kid," or "I can't pay bills because you don't pay me," please be sure and leave out the part about trying to make it a point to go the movies, or out to eat, or any other outing at least once a week. If you're blowing your money doing those things, you can't be hurting that bad. You most certainly shouldn't threaten the other parent with loss of visitation to their child! Yes the judge may have given you custody......but they're still the parent as well. You're not only hurting them but you will tear your child apart by using them as a weapon against the other parent!! The ONLY reason that sort of threat should come about is if the child is not being taken care of or is in some sort of dangerous situation while under the supervision of the other parent......and never at any other time. I really hate hearing people do these things to other people. And for no other reason besides the fact they think it's a way to keep them under their thumb. Some people think they have to have control of everything..........they need to grow up and realize that nobody ever has full control of anything.  Once they do that, they may be capable of being half way decent people.
