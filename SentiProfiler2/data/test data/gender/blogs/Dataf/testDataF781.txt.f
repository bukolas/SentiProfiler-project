I like the Clear Care contact products. I used to use the kind my eye doctor gave me until my fiance recommended this one.  It can be a little pricey, but you can save some of the fluid by not rinsing the contacts before storing them in the case (which is always included in the new box of fluid).  I never rinse them, and my fiance always rinses his, and we don't seem to have any differences.
