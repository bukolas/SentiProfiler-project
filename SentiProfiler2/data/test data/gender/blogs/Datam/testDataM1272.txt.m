Apple will be hosting a WebKit Contributors Meeting at its campus in Cupertino, CA on Monday, April 12 and Tuesday, April 13 from 9am to 6pm PDT. The meeting is targeted at contributors to the WebKit Open Source Project. The meeting will have an “unconference”-like format, allowing plenty of time for impromptu sessions/discussions and hacking.

A new mailing list, webkit-meeting, will be used for general discussion and to communicate additional information about the meeting. You can subscribe at lists.webkit.org. Questions may also be sent to Adele Peterson at adele at webkit.org.

The meeting will be free of charge. All WebKit contributors are encouraged to attend. However, space is limited, so registrations will be accepted on a first come, first served basis.

Please register for the meeting using the meeting registration form by Thursday, April 1.

We hope to see you there!


Daniel has made many valuable contributions to WebKit including additions to the XSSAuditor, which helps prevent reflective cross site scripting attacks, as well as numerous changes to drag and drop ensuring that WebKit complies with the HTML5 spec. Of course, all of this was supported with thorough tests and improvements to WebKit’s testing harness. Recently, Daniel has been working on features for mobile devices such as a cross platform patch to enable faster mobile scrolling on pages with static background images.

Please join me in congratulating Daniel on his reviewer status!


Nate got his start in WebKit with helping to upstream Javascript bindings for the Chromium port into WebKit. During that work, he learned much about WebKit style as well as getting to know the bindings quite well. Since then, he continued to do a prodigious amount with the bindings and improved them in many ways. In addition, he also added noreferrer support and fixed bugs in a variety of areas such as the loader and plugin scripting.

Please join me in congratulating Nate on his reviewer status!


Jeremy has done a lot of work on local storage and session storage within WebKit. Much of this brought it up to date with spec changes, but he also improved it by adding quota support and fixing many bugs. As part of the Chromium port, he also worked on its WebKit api and JavaScript bindings.

Please join me in congratulating Jeremy on his reviewer status!
