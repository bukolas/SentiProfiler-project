I use all of hylands products! I love the arnica and any time someone is hurt I give it to them. I also love the fact that it is safer than name brand products you see in the store. About four years ago my daughter fell and hit a sprinkler so hard that it snapped in half. My parents were going to give her tylenol and I said NO!! The bruise was about four inches all the way around. I had my mom give her arnica tablets three times a day and then apply arnica cream to the bruise in the morning and then again at night.
