While I am giving the finishing touches at LineBall (yes, I found a sponsor), I want you to play ColorBallz. It’s a simple game I made in a couple of days starting from Basic Filler engine with Box2D – part 1, 2 and 3.

All in all it’s almost the same game, I just added a twist introducing colors. You’ll get a bonus if you fill the area with the same percentage of red, green and cyan colors. Although I already have two games about to be published, this is the first of my 10 games to be released in 2010.

It’s monetized with MochiAds but I’m also planning to sell the complete source code once it’s polished and fully commented.

At the moment, after 6 days in the wild, it has more than 100K plays… hope to reach one million in a couple of weeks.

Enjoy. Before you start reading this tutorial, there is something you must do.

Turn off the lights, close your eyes, raise your hands, and say:

« Hail, Lord of Flash Game. Shall I read this tutorial and forget it before I try to flood the web with another silly Coloring Book Game »

Really, seriously… I am showing you how do it but please, please… don’t do it.

Finding the right image

If you can’t draw your image, you’ll have to download it from the web. Try to Google for coloring book and you’ll know what I mean.

Just remember the “copyright” word… I don’t think you’re allowed to use Ben 10 or Hello Kitty images… but if you are about to create a Flash coloring book, you are an evil person and stealing artworks won’t be a problem.

The image I’ll use is taken from www.coloringbook.info

Main concept

Every colorable part is a distinct movieclip, and its color is dynamically changed with Actionscript

Converting the image

First, you need to import it into Flash  It’s a Box2D library designed to allow game developers making 2D side-scrolling platform games, including a graphical level builder that allows you to drag, drop, and customize all of the game objects and art in your game.
