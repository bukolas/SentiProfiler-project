Michael noted earlier that the money is flowing for pro and anti-reform TV ads this week. One more was just released - this time from Moveon.org. The ad flashes pictures of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. while a voiceover says voting for health care reform amounts to being "on the right side of history." Moveon.org, a left-leaning group powerful for its ability to raise a lot of money quickly, is pulling out all the messaging stops. Greg Sargent also suggests the ad is a signal to House Democrats that, come fall, Moveon.org will be there for those who vote for health care reform now.
