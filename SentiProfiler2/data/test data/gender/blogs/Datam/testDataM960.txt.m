Your probably going to read this someday, if not sooner or later, probably sooner then I realize. I did what I had to do the way I thought it be proper anyhow. I’m sorry if you don’t approve of the decision I made. Here’s why I chose to say no more to our friendship. 


 You need to consider yourself a very lucky woman. You have a house, a nice car, and a good job so you would think things would be okay here. I’m not saying everything (or everyone) is perfect. But here’s my conflict with you and our friendship. Your husband feels as if though he is between a rock and a hard case with the marriage you two are binded in. He has taken it upon himself to contact most of the people you talk to to find out about Ricardo. Now something is very wrong with your marriage if he feels threatened enough to contact EVERYONE (this includes me) to tell Ricardo to stop talking to you. Something had to have been going on somewhere to make him feel this way. I know this from experience. I’m not saying you are cheating on him. Maybe you are, and if you are you need to either divorce him. Or you need to make the marriage you have right now work. Do you have any idea how lucky you are? Do you have any idea How much your husband loves you? I’m starting to understand why he is so far from you. I don’t think it’s all him anymore. Maybe it was in the beginning. But not anymore. 


 All I know is I’m not going to be an instigator into making him (or anyone else for that matter) feel bad. I know what my heart tells me about the situation. If you have guy friends, they need to remain your friends and nothing more! I have taken it upon myself to end the friendship so that way you and your husband can make things work out. I’m one less person he will have to worry about and that’s okay. He is supposed to come first in your life. You two are not boyfriend and girlfriend. This isn’t the situation in which you two need to put your friends first. You two swore at the alter to be there for each other through everything and anything. I think news the time to do just that. You can call me self-righteous and immoral. But if you do so you are only speaking of yourself as well. 

 This is what all your friends (whom re doing wrong with you) need to do if they care about the life you lead....
