I've officially decided to wait on the Wii. With articles like this one popping up around the internet, I think it is worth my while to hold out until at least sometime next year. I got the DS right after it came out and then was upset when they put out the DS Lite not long afterward. Of course I switched to the sleeker and brighter Lite version, but I don't want to have to do that with the Wii.
