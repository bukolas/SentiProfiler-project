No brother I had forgot that! InshAllah we will see him hang in Mogadishu with others with him! And if any brother can speech french or somali then InshAllah they should spread the message I wrote as I think its the only way to stop the assinations and arrests of our brothers...they take our precious mujahedin leaders out one by one and an alim mujahid and leader is not easy to replace! May Allah (subhana wa taala) give the brothers in that country the power and curage to make the dirty kuffar witness death to their leaders!
