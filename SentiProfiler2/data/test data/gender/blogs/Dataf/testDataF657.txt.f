The world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that Olivier Dupon from Dossier37 is one of them. He is known to many Sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop Lola Et Moi, which he ran&nbsp;for about three years,&nbsp;and now the rest of the world is getting to know&nbsp;his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog&nbsp; Dossier37 . Olivier kindly shared these pics with Daily Imprint of his home in Pyrmont. As he describes it, "Great views, great light... We use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks&nbsp;and designer pieces." Which five words best describe you? Perseverance, reliability, compassion, flair, hard work. What was your first job and what path have you taken since then? I worked for Christian Dior as a production assistant (in the ready-to-wear department). This led to another contract as senior production assistant. From then, I expanded my experience by working for the extreme opposite of luxury fashion, that is mass market fashion. I spent about 6 years as a fashion buyer for a big French retailer. I then moved to London for&nbsp;4 years as a product manager for a fashion house. I then relocated to Australia, and this big move was a trigger for my current career. I decided to open my own shop [Lola Et Moi] and to work closely with independent designers. Back to the hand-made, unique and creative scene, which is my true passion . What’s your proudest career achievement? Opening a successful shop on my own, out of no experience in this particular field, in a foreign country. What’s been your best decision? Pursuing the person, who has now been making me happy for the past 6 years. Who inspires you? Whistleblowers and scientists (not the sceptic ones). What are you passionate about? Common sense, environmental issues and creativity. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt? Patience is a virtue. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Any billionaire that has no idea how he can make a positive difference in this world. What dream do you still want to fulfil? I will have to get back to you in 5 years' time for that one. What are you reading? La Délicatesse by David Foenkinos. A french fiction novel (a quirky love story) and probably one of the best books I have read. images courtesy of dossier37 There are some stores that I enjoy visiting just for a pick-me-up. One of these is the Fleur Wood shops in Paddington and The Strand. Instantly I'm transplanted to a world where beauty reigns supreme and femininity is the order of the day. Not only do I covet everything I see, but the decor is sublime. Meet the ever-so stylish woman behind the designs. Which five words best describe you? Busy, sometimes cranky, and always trying to look at bright side. (sorry more than five words). How did you get your start in fashion and what path have you taken since? &nbsp;I started out as a VM and on the retail floor selling, I never really intended on being a fashion designer. What advice would you give to aspiring designers? Don't! Just kidding. Work hard and don't worry about what every body else is doing. What's your proudest career achievement? I am always delighted when I&nbsp;&nbsp;see someone walking down the street in one of my designs. What has been your best decision? To listen to people with more&nbsp;&nbsp;experience and take good advise when offered. Who inspires you? My husband. What are you passionate about? Human rights. Which person, living or&nbsp;dead, would you most like to meet? Mary Magdeline. What dream do you&nbsp;still want to fulfil? World peace. What are you reading? The beautiful fall , by Alicia Drake. The story of&nbsp;the friendship of Karl Lagerfield and Yves Saint Laurent. images courtesy of fleur wood You might have seen Stephen Ormandy 's artworks on a recent cover of Vogue Living - his home with fellow Dinosaur Design 's founder Louise Olsen was featured inside. Or you might have seen his recent exhibition at the Tim Olsen Gallery - I still have the flyer pinned to my board at work (he used the most beautiful yellow, grey and blue combinations). Alternatively, you might just know him as part of the triumvirate - Liane Rossler is the third partner - that established Dinosaur Designs. Which five words best describe you? Lover, optimist, enthusiast, dedicated, inquisitive. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? I have never worked for anyone but myself and don't consider working at Dinosaur Designs or painting as a job, It feels more like living a creative life. I first dreamed about being a painter in kindergarten, which is all about play and creativity, how much fun is that, no wonder I was hooked early. What’s the best advice you’ve been given? Travel. What’s your proudest career achievement? A solo show at Tim Olsen Gallery. What has been your best decision? Applying to study at COFA. Who inspires you? Matisse, Picasso, William Scott, Victor Pasmore, Miro, Arp, Tapio Wirkkala, John Olsen, John Coburn, Dale Frank, Anish Kapoor, Urs Fischer, Wolfgang Laib..... What are you passionate about? Family. Painting. Designing. Surfing. Food. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Matisse. What dream do you still want to fulfil? I have so much to be thankful for already. What are you reading? The $12 million&nbsp;stuffed shark by Don Thompson. Glimmer by Warren Berger. images courtesy of stephen ormandy and tim olsen gallery It had been a while since I'd visited&nbsp; Davidmetnicole . But I knew they'd be a great place to get&nbsp;props and those special little touches that set off a shot for a recent shoot. After one failed mission there - closed for a refurbishment -&nbsp;I returned a few weeks later. Oh, what a cornucopia of rubber stamps they have! And not mass-produced ones from China. No, these were old-fashioned stamps used in&nbsp;offices when filing cabinets were made of wood and phone calls were made via&nbsp;a switchboard.&nbsp;Then I came across&nbsp;images of their home shot for Vogue Living, and realised that I actually have the photo&nbsp;of the flowers in a glass lantern tucked into my&nbsp;reference book. It seems David and Nicole have always held a special place in my heart. Which words best describe you? Eclectic, organised, disorganised. What was your first job and what path have you taken since? Difficult, never been big on a "career" did mainly whatever was interested in. Worked in everything from set design, through to horticulture and forestry, to retail. Loved them all, but retail is where my heart lies! What's the best lesson you've learnt? Double check everything, even if it sounds simple and everyone understands and it all looks fine, run through it again just to be sure. What's your proudest achievement? The store (davidmetnicole) it¹s our own company. Not working all hours for someone else's dream and that's always the best! What's been your best decision?&nbsp; To stop moving around, place to place, job to job etc and settle down. You can only truly achieve something once you stay in one spot for a while! Who inspires you? &nbsp;I must say the modern "man/humanity" does not often inspire me. The world is too caught up in making money, celebrity and the next big thing to be truly interesting . I always naturally seem to be inspired by past humanity in general and the amazing things that were achieved in a time before computers, the internet, the highly mechanised world we live in today! These people were truly amazing and we owe them a lot. What are you passionate about? Well made (anything) very rare now. The throw away society is destroying our planet and it's for all of us to step up, demand quality products that last and can be repaired and importantly ...be prepared to pay for them. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Listening and talking to my Great Great Nana. I was too young to properly have a conversation with her while she was alive and she lived through the most interesting period in human history from late Victorian through to the 60s. She died in the early nighties. She was one of Queen Victoria's official knitters and knitted all of the Queen's&nbsp;tea-cosies and met her several times. She survived a Zeplin attack in London during the First World War, and was an air field medic serving with a hurricane squad during the Second World War... amazing! What are you reading?&nbsp; Brave new world. shop images davidmetnicole and others&nbsp;via moodboard I never EVER thought I would ever do anything crafty. You see, I'm the girl who had to get a boy to finish my sewing project at school because I was doing such a terrible job. Me and sewing machines just didn't mix... then. NOW, well it all seems a different story, but I still haven't actually used a machine. Just lots of cutting, stitching and fumbling my way through. But somehow I'm really getting into the vibe of making things. It really is much more satisfying than I ever thought possible. On the office shoot that I styled for the March issue of real living (on sale until Monday, when the next issue comes out) I went crazy in the "Crafty Industrial" space. Hope you like these little ideas that were shot on the day. images real living and chris warnes Just&nbsp;before the summer&nbsp;break I went to the book launch of The Crafty Minx . I always try to get along to these events because I'm fascinated to learn the process that goes into creating a book. It's also an interesting insight into what authors are actually like. I enjoyed&nbsp;hearing&nbsp;publisher Kay Scarlett speak about the "Minx" herself, Kelly Doust . She described the first time they met. Kelly was dressed in customised vintage clothes and looked divine. Right then Kay knew that this was no ordinary woman. Since then Kelly has gone on to not only publish her collection of craft projects but has also written a follow-up book The Crafty Kid , which will be published&nbsp;mid-year. And a memoir is in the works too. All this and Kelly is&nbsp;mum to an 18-month-old&nbsp;girl.&nbsp; Which five words best describe you? Creative, happy, passionate, hardworking and flawed. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? My first job out of university was in an investment bank, believe it or not. It made me realise how important it is to be surrounded by like-minded people every day you possibly can ... so I left. Shortly afterwards, I went on to study book editing and publishing before moving into the industry, and worked there up until recently as a book publicist. I also ventured into journalism, agency publicity and advertising along the way, but always kept coming back to books. Publishing folk are my kin. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Confucius said it first: find a job you'll love and you'll never work a day in your life . What’s your proudest career achievement? Having my first book published. What’s been your best decision? Leaving my job when I was five months' pregnant to work on the proposal for The Crafty Minx. I honestly haven't regretted it for a second, although those first few weeks were nerve-wracking . It took a while to get into the rhythm of working from home. Who inspires you? Barack Obama for his social conscience, passion and dignity, and my friend Maggie Hamilton - a social researcher and writer. What are you passionate about? My husband and daughter, friends, home, food, fashion, travel, and treading lightly upon this earth of ours... plus a whole list of other things too long to mention. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? I'm not much for meet and greets, but I'd very much like to have a decent conversation with Emily Dickinson about her poetry, which resonates still after so many years . What dream do you still want to fulfil? To write a good novel. What are you reading? I've just finished reading Sarah Waters' The Little Stranger, which I thought was gripping and masterfully told, and have AM Homes' This Book Will Save Your Life, a biography of Muriel Spark by Martin Stannard and a quirkly little book called Important Artifacts and Personal Property from the Collection of Lenore Doolan and Harold Morris by Leanne Shapton on the go. images courtesy of kelly doust It's always interesting what stands the test of time when it comes to design. Looking over images of Romaine Alwill 's styling&nbsp;from when she worked at Belle magazine, I'm impressed by how stunning and thoughtful the images are - still. Now, she's gone full circle and returned more to her area of study&nbsp;- interior architecture&nbsp;- with her company Alwill , a&nbsp;business she runs with her sister Nadine. Which five words best describe you? Ooh - this is hard... curious, motivated (or workaholic), energetic, easy going (I hope!), efficient. What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? After graduating from&nbsp;university the first job I really enjoyed was as interior design editor at Belle magazine, which I did for&nbsp;five years. It exposed me to so many aspects of the industry. It wasn't a conventional role to take after studying interior architecture but it was creatively very satisfying . What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Trust your instincts and stand your ground. What’s your proudest career achievement? I feel like there is still so much to learn, so I hope that it is still ahead! What’s been your best decision? Starting my own business and having a family. There are challenges but they are worth it! Who inspires you? People who are open to allowing new creativity and ideas to flourish + fine craftsmen. What are you passionate about? Travelling and seeing other cultures. Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Anastasia, daughter of the Tsar of Russia. I'm fascinated by that story. What dream do you still want to fulfil? To have "alwill" as a total lifestyle company. What are you reading? I just had a baby so there isn't much time for reading so I have a short book called The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennet. images courtesy of romaine alwill christina with her miniature poodle, walter Now, I know this is going to sound a little strange - but there are a lot of similarities between baby and pet products. Just because you adore your little one doesn't mean you want them bedecked in garish colours or cheap-quality merchandise. That's why Best in Park is already a huge hit with dog lovers. It's quality all the way, which is not surprising given the designer and brains behind the business is Christina Teresinski, who has learnt on the job&nbsp;with some of Australia's biggest and most well-loved brands. Which five words best describe you? Passionate, organised, engaging, sensitive and dog-loving! What was your first career job and what path have you taken since? After completing an arts degree at Melbourne University, I landed my dream marketing assistant job at Esprit. It was the heady, early nineties and the stores back then were designed by Ettore Sottsass, Shigeru Uchida &amp; Antonio Citterio . This led to some time at an advertising agency and then a marketing communications role at Country Road. The role presented some great opportunities . The beauty industry beckoned, and marketing combined with my love of the creative process led me to product development – more recently Mecca Cosmetica &amp; Kit. What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt along the way? Be true to your own vision and values, never be afraid to express yourself and surround yourself with inspiring, positive individuals . What’s your proudest career achievement? The opportunity to travel the world in various roles and to start Best in Park, which combines my&nbsp;experience with my love of dogs! Also, one of the highlights&nbsp;was my first international 'Best in Park' order from Atelier Abigail Ahern, an inspiration, who I know you have profiled on Daily Imprint! [Yes, LOVE her - read the interview here .] What’s been your best decision? Leaving the security and benefits of a demanding full-time career to re-group and start something for myself. Who inspires you? Individualists. My very clever &amp; understanding husband Sebastian, my mum and my free-thinking, creative friends. The inhabitants of my neighborhood (Fitzroy &amp; Collingwood). What a
e you passionate about? Embracing life, travelling to cities near and far, collecting experiences, culture, visual arts, loved ones &amp; my dog Walter and his friends (my muses). Which person, living or dead, would you most like to meet? Artist Ricky Swallow , the late Sunday Reed , Sonia Rykiel and Valentino ’s five pugs (if only they could speak!) What dream do you still want to fulfill? Too many to list so here is a sample; to experience the northern lights in Norway, see dogs around the world wearing Best in Park, build a beach house, spend a year in New York … What are you reading? Seven Types of Ambiguity by Elliot Perlman, Flowing Like the River by Paulo Coelho (always on my bedside table), lifestyle blogs/e-zines and shelter publications from around the world &nbsp; images courtesy of best in park
