Hello b.vikki vintage readers, I've not forsaken you completely! Yes, it's been a long while since I've posted, but I wanted to share some news with you all and POSSIBLY get your help with a new venture: I'll be freelancing for the next three month over at Zora&amp;Alice ( zora-alice.com ), a new blog and monthly magazine aiming to start a new conversation about black women. Read more about Zora&amp;Alice HERE &amp; below: The Mission: Zora&amp;Alice magazine’s mission is to be the premier online destination for quality reporting and analysis on issues that affect contemporary, young black women. At any given time, we hope to accomplish three of the four: To provide a fresh, intelligent voice for young black women To empower and uplift young black women as they develop unique identities To support and promote young black women as entrepreneurs, creators and pioneers To wear power pumps and rule the world like the stone cold forces we know ourselves to be About the Name: Our name is inspired by the collection ” I Love Myself When I’m Laughing…And Then Again When I’m Looking Mean &amp; Impressive,” an anthology of works by Zora Neale Hurston and edited by Alice Walker. Zora Neale Hurston was an iconoclast, underappreciated and condemned for her independence, whose many contributions to American literary canon would have been ignored were it not for the persistence of those she inspired, including Walker. I've pursued more interests in my 23 years than I care to recount, but the constant through them all has been writing and literature. I'm very excited to be involved with Zora&amp;Alice and hope you all will check it out in April at the time of its launch. Of course, I'll have lots to say about vintage fashion, among other things, so be sure to sign up for the Zora&amp;Alice email list to stay updated on the magazine's progress. Also, if you are, or know of any great black Etsy retailers, leave your/their info in the comments or email me at becca.oneal@gmail.com! Last but not least, I've got about 20 vintage dresses on my hands and I'll be doing a giveaway VERY soon, so if you like winning free clothes, stay tuned for more info. More posts coming soon! ;) More menswear! The following images are featured in reverse chronological order from the years 1960-1962 with a final photo from 1954. http://menincardigans.tumblr.com/ The above editorial reminds me a bit of the Mad Men season 2 poster - and the train scenes from Revolutionary Road: I know this post is about vintage mens' fashions, but I love the chunky three-stand pearl necklace and wiggle dress on the female model! I wouldn't mind seeing more modern men in patterned blazers! He certainly looks to be in the midst of a jaunty number! A 1961 model dressed like a 2009 hipster dressed like an 1890s dandy (according to the New York Times Style Section, if you want to take their word for it)... A thing like that! And who doesn't love plus-fours? Is that a Bolex you're holding? Like his frames. LOVE her dress! Glitter isn't an oft used term in menswear descriptions these days, but I heartily welcome its return!

The Brooklyn Circus - video http://thebkcircus.com/bkc/ http://putthison.com (All of Jesse Thorn's projects are worth a gander, but this is one of my personal favorites. I also highly recommend his non-fashion related podcast The Sound of Young America) http://streetetiquette.com/ http://nerdboyfriend.tumblr.com/ This post is all about links! First, I want to link to this great post at AfroDandy about Black / African Pin-up art . I'm a big fan of Bettie Page , but have either neglected to seek out or failed to come across many images of Black pin-up models. The image below, originally featured on The Pin-Up Blog caught my eye and I couldn't resist posting it here: The photos are great, but be sure to read Zavi's post! Within that post, was a link to a blog I'd stumbled upon a few months ago while doing research for b.vikki vintage, but had, until the post at AfroDandy, nearly forgotten all about (I almost imperceptibly linked to it in my post on the movie Reet, Petite, and Gone ) : Ladies of Harlem ! It's a simple, one page site, but the pictures speak volumes! I'll be posting more consistently in the coming days: more mens fashions from the 50s and early-mid 1960s, part 2 of Vintage Black Voters and Politicians, and the Vintage Black Brides series will move into 1961.... and if you read this blog, you know that I never EVER stick to a schedule, so there will be plenty of mix-ups and unexpected posts along the way. Today is my 23rd birthday! And the three month anniversary of b.vikki vintage! Thank you all for reading. Don't forget to visit b.vikki vintage on Etsy! The first Vintage Black Weddings post of the 1960s! I've been looking forward to breaking into this decade, as the gown styles become more fashion forward seemingly overnight. The line of demarcation is so pronounced it seems there was no time to transition. In this post, featuring gowns, weddings, and brides from the year 1960, you can whet your appetites with a brief taste of the styles to come. I remember hearing during a Making Of Mad Men special that they chose to set the first season of the show in 1960 because the last year of any decade is the culmination of the culture of the one it proceeds (for example: the year that best sums up 1980s style and culture was 1990). This post can be added to the anecdotal evidence column in proof of that theory. As you can see, the prevalent 1950s trend of longsleeved gowns with scalloped or diaphanous necklines is still dominant in 1960. What I love most about this photo is that the affection is so clearly evident! Looking at so many wedding photos has desensitized me to the occasion a bit, but images like the one above remind me of what it's all about. In the image above, from a 1960 Ebony Fashion Fair editorial, you can see the gown styles shifting from the traditional silhouettes of the 1950s to more mod, architectural designs of the 1960s. In the next installment of Vintage Black Weddings, this shift becomes even more apparent. Because the photo above is from a pictorial and straight from the runway, it's a few years before this style trickles down to every day brides. But when it finally does, it revolutionizes bridal fashion. A wedding fountain! A thing like that! Trans-World Airlines' first Black hostess - reminds me of this post. Eartha Kitt's 1960 wedding to John "Bill" McDonald must have been stunning. Her contoured illusion neckline is really beautiful in satin. The next Vintage Black Weddings post, featuring images from 1961, is quite the departure from previous installments. I'm looking forward to sharing it with you all. Thanks for reading.

I'd missed being of age to vote in the previous Presidential election of 2000 by only 6 months. By 2008, I'd voted in several local and senatorial elections, including my having voted for Barack Obama for senator in my home state of Illinois in 2004. During the summer of 2005, I interned at a political fundraising firm and got a brief taste of the political arena in Chicago and Illinois. Kwame Raoul, the state senator who filled the seat evacuated by Obama when he was elected to the United States Senate, was among the firm's client. For an exceptionally transient moment in time, I thought I'd enter politics and was enamored of all its glamour. I remember exactly where I was when Barack Obama announced his candidacy for the presidency. There'd been much teasing in the months preceding his official declaration, on local new shows and before football games, all to innocuous results. It was February 2006. I was in Cincinnati for a party with friends from Chicago. We turned on the television at our host's home, which was crowded with 18 and 19 year olds, and a few young 20-somethings, tired from the night before, jaded in ways I probably don't need to describe any further, to find Barack Obama on the capitol steps at Springfield making his presidential run official. Everyone in the room understood the significance. I'd never, at the time, been more proud to be a young voter from Chicago. Since that day, November 4th 2008 and January 20th 2009 have eclipsed the pride I then felt. Not to diminish my generation's role in the election of Barack Obama, but I can't imagine the impact and overwhelming emotions felt by voters of color in the 1950s and 1960s, who dared to vote in the South while being confronted with threats of violence, of those who partook in and witnessed the election of an ally in Kennedy. The images below begin to tell their stories: This Leaders of Womanpower group reminds me of Betty Draper's Junior League in season 3 of Mad Men. In the coming days, I'll post more images and article excerpts of voters and politicians of color from 1963-1969. I'll also be continuing the Vintage Black Weddings and Vintage Menswear series, and will have more information, images, and clips from Vintage Black Films. Thank you for reading!

I've gotten more than a few requests to feature menswear on b.vikki vintage and to offer men's items in my Etsy shop. Of course! Who doesn't want to look like Don Draper? In the nascent days of b.vikki vintage I did a post featuring After 6 Tuxedo ads from 1959 - 1968 . As a continuation of that post, I offer the following vintage menswear looks (editorials and ads) as sartorial inspiration for male readers of b.vikki vintage. The images below are from 1968 and 1969 editions of Ebony Magazine. Enjoy! Men certainly didn't seem to be afraid of color in the late 1960s! I still love a man in a cardigan. It's a great way to look. The author of one of my favorite Tumblrs seems to agree: http://menincardigans.tumblr.com/ This Paris brand undergarments ad from 1969 evokes American Apparel, no? Several of the pictorials featured here that were shot at the Playboy headquarters in Chicago - which was, incidentally, very close to the Ebony Magazine headquarters. Hats! Hats should definitely come back. I know this post is about men, but that lime green two-piece ensemble is stunning. I'll continue this post later (probably later today) with earlier vintage menswear looks from the 1950s and early to mid 1960s. Here are some of my favorite menswear items available for sale on Etsy.

What I actually do would be more accurately described as lurking at thrift stores and estate sales), I'll be sure to keep a keen eye out for any fascinating men's items! I'm a fan of foppish dandies, as I fancy myself an eventual quaintrelle, so this post has been LONG overdue.

Before two and a half weeks ago I'd posted on b.vikki vintage regularly every day. I now plan to pick up the frequency yet again and get things back to normal around here! Here are some photographs and editorial shots from vintage issues of Ebony and Jet magazines from 1953 to 1967 of winter holiday celebrations and scenarios. The photo above is my favorite. We're getting to see a party, this one from 1963, in media res. The subjects aren't self-conscious and seems to be genuinely having a GREAT time. Wishing a safe and happy holiday season to all b.vikki vintage readers! Thanks for reading. Don't forget to visit b.vikki vintage on Etsy!
