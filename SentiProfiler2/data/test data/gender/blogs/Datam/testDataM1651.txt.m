Can we talk in Hindi?, he asks coolly as we settle down with meethi chai in an air-conditioned hostel room, which he shares with fellow boxers Vijay and Ram Singh at Patiala’s National Sports Institute. Why stay in a hostel, now? “As a child I shared a room with my brother and five cousins. We were seven in a tiny room, and now we are just three!” Uncluttered and uncomplicated.

It’s destiny that I was born into a humble bus driver’s family. Had I been pampered with trainers and dieticians, I wouldn’t be what I am today.

This six-feet-tall charmer has also walked the ramp for Rohit Bal.
