A friend of mine bought a puppy. It ran around with the kind of wet nosed, furry coated, and playful disposition that is really quite endearing. So of course (like a sucker) I said yes when he approached me with the opportunity of selling the little guy. He couldn't rightly keep him locked up alone in his house while he was gone all day. And frankly I was looking for a friend who was good at listening, and not so good at talking. Some of the training him not to poop in my house was a bit of pain, but we've long since left those things in the past (well at least I hope so).

However my furry friend has developed a bit of a desire to explore. Lately he's been heading over to the neighbors which, where I live, is a bit of a distance. He has all the room in the world out here. I don't mind if he's out exploring several miles away (he knows where home is). But I'm just not that crazy about him bothering the neighbors. Although their little daughter loves him to death and begins chanting his name when he's around.

Today I decided to give the "ok" for my friend to tie a couple of tin cans to his tail. And of course as soon as the deed was done he took off running. He ran around their yard some (spooked their cattle a little) and then hid somewhere. By the time I decided to come and call for him he was yelping as if someone had hit him, and he dove into my truck ready to get home. Panting and all excited he just sat there and looked at me with eyes that spoke of a hard day.
