A couple of weeks ago, we went to the casino to watch some shows, gamble a little and hang out with some of her friends.  It was around 5:30 am when we were wating for a cab outside the casino.   She was dressed in her cultural attire, not her workaday business attire.  She's Cherokee.  She was wearing a black leather jacket with the long, thin leather tassles (about a foot long) and asked me to dance to the piped music in the foyer of the casino hotel.  So we did.  I just kinda swayed from side to side as I watched her.  She danced, and the leather tassles just swung in rhythm to her deliberate movements.  Grace.  Wow.  At least I thought so.....we were both well under the influence..

I love her spirituality as well.  She follows traditional native spiritual ideals.  She smudges regularly, participates in sweats.  I know so little of the cultural rituals, although we have discussed them on occasion.  

Anyway, what I am getting at is that there is so much about her I love.  I love that way back when.....at the time when my wife declined so quickly, and then when my son was severely injured, that she was one who I could rely on to give me another perspective.  I only knew her online then.  Four years ago, we started to talk.  Only in the last while did we meet.  She is exactly what she portrayed online, except for the physicality.  We really never discussed that.

So yes, I love her.  Is this something that will result in us getting together on a permanent basis, type deal?  Likely not.  I love her in that I really care how she is.  When she hurts, I feel it.  When she is happy, it makes me smile.  But it won't likely happen since I can't see our different lives meshing.  I know she knows that too.  It's a different thing than I have experienced before.  Not really sure......who knows.
