Its inaugural programme will see productions exploding like party-poppers around the country over the coming year. The range of work promises to be consistently attention-worthy, whether it be a new play about the Bridgend suicides, a forgotten early drama by John Osborne, or a major revival of The Persians by Aeschylus. As for locations, few travellers’ guides could offer such an adventurous variety: audiences will be invited into miners’ institutes in the Valleys, on to the beaches of North Wales, into a replica village on a MOD firing range in the Brecon Beacons, somewhere in Snowdonia, all across Port Talbot. Stick a pin in a map and something theatrical is almost certain to be in the offing there.

In fact, the only obvious locale that hasn’t been commandeered as a site-specific venue is a disused colliery. “Don’t worry,” John McGrath, NTW’s energetic and articulate artistic director assures me as we pace the rain-sodden high street of Blackwood, a small town in the South Wales Valleys where the first production is about to be unveiled. “We’re already having discussions about that. Would we try and take people down a mine? Absolutely! But we’d do it in an unusual way.’

Born in Wales but raised in Liverpool and hence regarded as an outsider, much in the mould of the NTS’s English director, Vicky Featherstone, McGrath shows such obvious devotion to the cause of giving NTW a big-splash start that it feels churlish to ask: does Wales need its own national theatre? In fact, you could ask: does it need a second national theatre? Because, unnoticed by many, a dedicated Welsh-language company, Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, was launched in 2003.

A former Eng Lit student at Oxford, where he first started to direct before honing his craft in Poland, then New York, and latterly Manchester, which saw him build an experimental buzz around the Contact Theatre, McGrath, 47, reflects: “If you’re going to have national theatres, theatres that enable countries to think about themselves, then Wales needs one. You could just put more money into touring, but that wouldn’t have the same effect. The word national focuses everyone’s minds. With Wales, there’s an added complexity surrounding language. There was a feeling that Welsh-language theatre needed a scale it hadn’t had the opportunity to work on before. After that the question was: what about English language theatre, given that English is a language virtually everyone in Wales shares?”
