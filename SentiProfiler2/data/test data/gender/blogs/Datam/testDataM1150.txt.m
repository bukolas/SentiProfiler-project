I set out to write an article about the unique features of XNA Game Studio on Windows Phone 7 Series, but while trying to populate my outline, I realized, wow, there actually aren’t many things different about Game Studio 4.0 on the phone compared to Windows and Xbox 360! That’s bad news for this article, but I think good news for our platform as a whole. With Game Studio 4.0, we made a concerted effort to increase portability and consistency across our target platforms.

In some areas it was obvious how to achieve consistency. For instance, Windows Phone 7 Series includes a Zune media client, so we could port our existing Zune media APIs. Input is similarly straightforward. If you only want to access a single touch point, you can use our existing Mouse API. If you need multitouch (the phone supports four simultaneous touches), you can use an API similar to what we previously shipped for Zune HD. This touch API works on Windows 7 PCs with multitouch displays, too.

Other areas, especially graphics, were more challenging to design. Had we just ported the Game Studio 3.1 graphics API, we would have been left with a confusing mess of non-overlapping caps that would make it hard to port code between Windows, Xbox, and the phone. But we didn’t want to force a lowest common denominator approach: it would make no sense to limit Xbox 360 games to only those features which are also available on mobile hardware!
