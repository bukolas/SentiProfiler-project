Humble living does not diminish. It fills. Going back to a simpler self gives wisdom. When a man makes up a story for his child, he becomes a father and a child &nbsp;together, listening. Before death takes away what you are given, give away what is there to give. No dead person grieves for his death. He mourns only what he didn't do. Wy did I wait? Why did I not . . . ? Why did I neglect to . . . ? I cannot think of better advice to send. I hope you like it. May you stay in your infinity. Peace. "One hundred and forty-seven of Rumi's letters survive. Many of them contain lines of poetry composed while writing the letters." The taste of today is not that of yesterday. A pot boils over. A watchman calls down the ladder, Did you hear the commotion last night from the seventh level? Saturn turns to Venus and tells her to play the strings more gently. Taurus milk runs red. Leo slinks from the sky. Strange signs, because of a word that comes from the soul to help us escape from speaking and concepts. I answer the nightwatchman, You will have to assign meanings for these ominous events. I have been set free from the hunt, the catching and the being caught, to rest in these dregs of flood residue, pure and empty. The open sky drinks from their circling cup. The sun wears the gold of their generosity. When two of them meet, they are no longer two. They are one, and six hundred thousand. The ocean waves are their closest likeness when wind makes from unity the numerous. This happened to the sun, and it broke into rays. The disc of the sun does exist, but if you see only the ray-bodies, you may have doubts. The human-divine combination is a oneness. Plurality, the apparent separation into rays. Friends, we are traveling together. Throw off your tiredness. Let me show you one tiny spot of the beauty that cannot be spoken. I am like an ant that has gotten into the granary, ludicrously happy, and trying to lug out a grain that is way too big. Sufi masters are those whose spirits existed before the world. Before the body, they lived many lifetimes. Before seeds went into the ground, they harvested wheat. Before there was an ocean, they strung pearls. While the great meeting was going on about bringing human beings into existence, they stood up to their chins in wisdom water. When some of the angels opposed creation, the Sufi sheikhs laughed and clapped among themselves. Before materiality, they knew what it was like to be trapped inside matter. Before there was a night sky, they saw Saturn. Before wheat grains, they tasted bread. With no mind, they thought. Immediate intuition to them is the simplest act of consciousness, what to others would be epiphany. Much of our thought is of the past, or the future. They are free of those. Before a mine is dug, they judge coins. before vineyards, they know the excitements to come. In July, they feel December. In unbroken sunlight, they find shade. In fana , the state where all objects dissolve, they recognize objects. Again it happens in my sleep. A core of wakefulness opens. But I have ways of ignoring that. You say, How long will you beg from others, when there are things born of you that emperors want? Why waste time in meanness? Who else can say what you say to me? If I could repeat it, people passing by would be enlightened and go free. You are an ocean in my chest where everyone changes places, believer-unbeliever, cynic-lover, dervish-king. Last night you came to my sleep asking, How are you? Locked out of life, waiting, weeping.
