As an undeniable WASP whose North American ancestry goes back to the colonial period, I usually keep my opinions of Israel’s behavior to myself.  Such is my concern for the typical whiplash from many of my fellow citizens who remain ensconced in a sort of Israel-right-or-wrong mindset.  But in the current Israeli issue before the US—Israel’s continual building program’s encroachment on Palestinian land—while we are sacrificing treasure and lives in the Middle East and continue to suffer financial stress at home, I am unable to keep my mouth shut.  Israel’s recalcitrance mit gewalt, so to speak, is insane.
