I use to think about stuff like this all the time, mainly on trains. I love trains. Those noisy, crammed, and sometimes smelly Boston transit system commutes were my time to drown out everything around me and just reflect on me. Pin drops would echo within the Zen pools of my mind, it was so quiet in there. You can't daydream on car commutes; I wouldn't recommend it.

During those train rides, I use to think about what truly made me happy, about my relationships past and current, about my friendships, and about my future. I found peace reading and contemplating over the works of Locke, Whitman, and Marquez. And from those uncomfortable subway seats I watched and admired the bustling life of this metropolitan city and the interactions of its denizens. But despite years of watching and reflection, I could never answer that one haunting question: why canâ€™t I be happy?
