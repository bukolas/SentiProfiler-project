Rahul - Those who are reading this blog first time , I'll suggest you to read the previous post first.

While my father was doing all the fee payment work and I was just roaming (admiring) the building, a boy came to me and asked "Are you Abhyuday ?". I asked to myself, "Am I so famous?". I said yes, he told me that he "ALSO" is in 11th class foundation course in here, as if he he knows everything about me. Then he showed his father and my father talking with each other. My father had cosen a room, suitable for me to live in and study, according to every possible condition. Far from traffic , near from garden, at walking distance from the main building, and not “too near to walk”.

While we were resting in the room , my father told me that he has invited that boy(Rahul) to live in this house. That house had 4 rooms 3 of which were already occupied, then Rahul's father mother visited and liked it and finalize it. In the evening everyone came, i.e. Rahul, and the house owner and other 2 roommates, one of them was doing some job and was about to leave in 15 days and another was an AIEEE aspirant, 12th just passed, Ajit Midhan. House owner was a kind man, in the first impression.

That night we(my father and I) went to buy all the stuff essential for living, cup, plate, tumbler, powder, soap , oil, comb, bed, pillow, water purifier, gas cylinder and most importantly two notebooks, as from the next day my classes were going to start, from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. For 2 days my father did everything, woke me up, made tea for me, cleaned the room and my bed, and what I did, just went class. Next day when I returned from the class after having dinner in the mess, which was on the way to class, I did not found him, his train was at 9:00 p.m. I thought I shouldn't have dinner and should have come room early. I felt unsafe, all alone in an unknown place, I was really scared, I was all my own. Then Rahul came and asked me to play cricket(inside the house), we played, and slowly slowly that feeling was gone.

Parents, I tell you, their love and care are undefined. My father knew that I will have this condition that’s why he approached Rahul’s parents, made us known to each other before he’s gone.

For 3-4 days we played cricket and only cricket and did nothing, except going class. One day while I was coming back from the class along with Rahul, I found a 10 Rs note in the road, I bought 2 icecreams 5 Rs each. That was the first thing I have ever bought for myself. I never got a chance, I hate to go to shop with my mother, she starts bargaining from 40% of the price told by the shopkeeper, if it is a salesman, its starting price will be 10% of the price told by the salesman. And if I am with my father, I never ask anything, its his money, if he wants to give me something from his money I should not ask for anything, I should, be very thankful to him. So I don't buy stuff for myself.

After 3-4 days, we (I and Ajit midhan) had a quarrel because of some cricket issues. Then after 2-3 days from that we(I and Rahul) had a quarrel because of a waking up issue. He did not wake me up and went to the class alone, and when I was expecting apologies from him, he laughed at me. Then I met Amul, he was 1 week late for the class. He came to me and asked for the notes , he was from Jabalpur, near to my place.
