What she doesn't know -- until now, because she reads the blog -- is that she has made this winter bearable for me. That early morning frosty air clears the mind. I've been able to put one foot in front of the other and march down the canal path because she has been by my side and listened to my sorrow spill out in rants and tears and Leroy stories and sometimes all three combined into one long walk. Some days, the hurt has just poured out of me.
