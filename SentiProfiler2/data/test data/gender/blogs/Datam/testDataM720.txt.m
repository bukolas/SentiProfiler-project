Reading Bob del Grosso's blog, I saw that fat is a 6th taste . As Bob points out, fat isn't a flavor - it is a taste . I'm reminded of the chart above about Mangalitsa pork, from a Swiss book . There's a nice post here about our Mangalitsa lard . I encourage everyone to compare whatever lard or shortening they've got side-by-side with our Mangalitsa lard, so they can see how superior our stuff is. Besides Foods in Season , Chef Shop is also selling Wooly Pigs brand lard. There's an article about butchery in the Sacramento Bee. It had a quote that stood out: "There are a lot of chefs getting into salumi and curing their own (pork) bellies and curing their own pork jowl, and because of that rising interest in salumi, you have to be fairly adept at butchery," he said. You don't have to be adept at butchery, if you buy your pork from Wooly Pigs . As described in this document , we sell cuts that are ready to be cured, whether by meat processors or chefs. The chef doesn't need to know how to produce a neck or a belly - he just needs to have the money to pay for it. I was talking with Michael Clampffer of Mosefund yesterday and he mentioned that he'd sold some pork to Momofuku, a famous New York City restaurant. I found this blog post that mentioned it : If I had to describe this extra fatty pork, it would be "foie gras pork". If I had to describe Mangalitsa, I'd call it, "pork that's actually worth eating." There's so much hype about pork these days, but most of it isn't worth eating - and that includes "heritage breeds" . The reason Mangalitsa gets so much press is that it tastes fantastic. Other pork doesn't live up to whatever hype it has. Americans are used to ignoring food hype. When something is actually superior, it makes waves. I think the fact that Mangalitsa is incomparably better than all other pork just shows how pathetic pork is now - you'd hope that some other pork would be somewhere close to Mangalitsa in eating quality. Unfortunately for consumers, there's no pork produced in the USA that isn't Mangalitsa that comes close to Mangalitsa in quality. Hopefully Momofuku will serve Mangalitsa again some day. Curemaster Rufus Brown (left) I saw this on the web about Provenance Farms and their Mangalitsa pigs . I got to meet Steve, one of the owners of Provenance Farms , in New Jersey at Mosefund , where he helped to kill, dehair, butcher and process Mangalitsa pigs under the instruction of the guy who trained our processor how to cut pigs, make lardo and Speck and so on . I love the fact that due to the efforts of Wooly Pigs , people across America - from California to Texas to Florida to to Maryland to New Jersey to Massachusetts to Minnesota to Missouri to Washington - are enjoying a new sort of extremely high quality food. I'm very pleased to see non-foodie Americans - the kind who own trucks and live away from the coasts and wear camo - producing this stuff. That tells me that extreme lard-type pork isn't just a fad. Speaking of which - from talking to Rufus, Johnston County Hams is about to finish its first batch of hams, bacon and cured jowl , made from our pork. Mike Sloan and his Mangalitsa lardo The Sausage Debauchery has a post about Mangalitsa lardo . Knight Salumi is about to start making Mangalitsa lardo . I'm going to bet that in 2010 and 2011, American foodies will start to talk about how amazing Mangalitsa lardo is. Pre-sliced Mangalitsa lardo - jalapeno flavor Wooly Pigs has finished its first batch of Mangalitsa lardo. It was made by Swiss Meat &amp; Sausage Company, the company that Christoph and Isabel Wiesner trained . We did four flavors. Inspired by the Wiesners (who export pepperoncini lardo to Japan for sushi), I had Swiss make some jalapeno lardo. I would have done pepperoncini, but I've not had American-made pepperoncini as good as the Italian stuff, and Americans like hotter stuff like jalapeno, so I decided to go for it with jalapeno lardo. It was excellent. The pepper gives the product some "heat". Mangalitsa bellies Swiss Meat can cut Mangalitsa pigs the way they do in Austria, as the photos show. There were no Austrians in the room when they fabricated these parts. It was an entirely American production. People who buy our products and meat are helping to improve America's culinary expertise one bite at a time - because that's what pays for it all. Mangalitsa hams, ready for curing While we were there, a guy who'd bought some feeder pigs from me, Harry Cope, brought one in to have it killed and cut, Austrian-style. He specifically brought his pig to Swiss to get it done that way. He could have gone somewhere closer, but they couldn't cut his pigs that way. If Wooly Pigs and Swiss hadn't taken pig butchery to the next level, he'd be stuck with wasteful Anglo-American butchery . Mangalitsa shoulders, ready for curing In addition to getting hams to cure, Harry will get shoulders, de-ribbed bellies, de-reribbed loins cur curing, fatback for lardo, fat for sausage, soft fat for rendering and leaf fat for leaf lard. Much of that product is going to Mark Sanfilippo - the same Mark Sanfilippo that the Wall St. Journal wrote about , along with Mangalitsa Lardo maker Rey Knight. The fact that Cope/Sanfilippo will get 4 categories of fat - an entirely reasonable thing from a Mangalitsa - isn't normal in America, but makes a lot of sense for a meat processor or a chef. Mangalitsa sirloins Mangalitsa rib-loins So our first batch of lardo finished. It was interesting to see how normal Missourians like the stuff. It was very popular. People immediately got that a little Mangalitsa lardo on a Ritz cracker, or a Mangalitsa lardo sandwich on some sandwich bread, is a fine snack. Slicing it thin - as shown in the picture above - makes it more palatable to people, and really stretches it. I figure we'll have to sell it pre-sliced (a bit like Kraft singles) so that those without rotary slicers can enjoy thinly-sliced lardo. Making lardo requires the butchers to separate the meat from the fat very carefully. Gouges in the fat are undesired, because salt will get trapped in it. The goal is to cleanly separate the fat slab from the meat. It is quite a challenge, because the guy doing the cutting can't see inside the meat. Last Fall, Wooly Pigs sold a lot of Mangalitsa loins. The loins had the fat on them. Some chefs complained that the yields were too low. To get the most out of the loin, they needed to remove the fatback and cure it into lardo. Looking back, I can't believe that we expected them to do that. How are they ever supposed to get any practice doing that sort of cutting and lardo making - especially considering that most American pigs don't have much fat on them, and the fat they have is typically unsuitable for making cured products? I can remember asking slaughterhouses in Washington and Idaho to separate the meat from the fat, so that the fat could be processed. The fact that we wanted special cutting was consistent with the special hogs (very fat, ugly and hairy) - yet they weren't responsive to our needs. The results were a lot of waste. That's why I'm so happy about Swiss Meat - they've taken this stuff seriously. To my knowledge, there's no other slaughterhouse in the USA where you can bring in a pig (Mangalitsa or otherwise), get it killed and cut "European-style" and have them make lardo out of its backfat. It won't surprise me if Swiss kills, cuts and even processes meat-type hogs the way they process Mangalitsa pigs - because right now, there's no other USDA-inspected plant up to the task. Torm Siverson of Pasture Prime Wagyu sent me photos of his first pig . It is astonishingly fat. Must be chefs - look at their shoes. I got an email from Pasture Prime Wagyu 's Torm Siverson about the first pig they killed. They non-butcher humans in the photo are some Florida chefs. The carcass was around 200#. It looks smaller to me in the photos. Torm (r) looking at his work. Given the coloring on the pig, it wouldn't surprise me if it was the cutest piglet in this photo , the little white piggy. Edit: Chef Windus wrote about this pig (and Pasture Prime Wagyu) on his blog . He's got more photos.
