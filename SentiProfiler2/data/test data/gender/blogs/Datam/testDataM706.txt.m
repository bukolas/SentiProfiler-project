Catch the goose... We had our opening night today. Or premiere. Do you call it premiere in English? I'm not sure. Anyway, it was a success. The shot you see I took from where I sit at the piano and I had to shoot from the hip because I had to make sure the audience didn't see me taking the shot. Fun. Party... We had a lot of fun on stage and later had an after show party. We hung out until 4 AM and I was so drunk I could hardly walk home. Water 'n ice... Yuki was at his daycare all day, and I had some time to get my software working. I do have lots and lots of sound libraries and I find it difficult to make them work. The architecture seems different than on my last computer and somehow they're not recognized by my music software. It's long process to get them to work properly. It has been extremely cold in the last days. Siberian cold. The winter just doesn't want to stop. Yuki has a cold again, I think this time he also got an eye infection. Need to go see the doctor. No wonder in this cold... Today we had our last rehearsal. It went well and we're set for tomorrow. Ended the day in a restaurant close to the theatre. I still have an undeveloped film in my Nikon, I'll add the missing pics when they're finished... Almost human... This morning our new CD's arrived. Yeah! A new CD, it's always nice. It's our band's 10th CD. Yuki slept until 10AM, that's 14 hours! After he woke up we went to the zoo where I met Anna Sofie, the costume designer from the theatre. We hung out until 1PM, she feels a bit lonely because she's from Munich and knows nobody here., so I asked her to come to the Zoo with me. After she left Sabina came, we had lunch at the zoo together. I have Yuki all day until 7 when I have to go to the rehearsals again. A long day. First working on the music with Josephine, then off to rehearsals where we tried out our new music, after rehearsalsI changed what didn't work, then went back to the theatre where we had the first of three run through rehearsals before opening night, after rehearsals we had a 2 hour critique with the entire crew, and then finally went to a restaurant for some food and wine. The rehearsal went really well. Joshua watched the play for the first time and liked it very much. I think the opening will be fine. The new music worked perfectly. We were able to incorporate it into the play with only one 2 hour rehearsal, not bad at all... I came home at 2:30 AM, wasted. Pink... A beautiful Sunday with perfect weather for a trip to the Zoo. I had Yuki and we both went there in a good mood. There were millions of people at the zoo. I usually go during the day and the zoo is often nearly empty, but on Sundays it's a nightmare. I'm not used to that... Later I had to work a lot because I had to do last minute adjustments to the music. Tomorrow morning Josephine's coming to my studio and I have to be prepared. We were supposed to have a musical rehearsal today at the theatre, but the whole sound system broke down, so we had to cancel it. This is getting tight now. There's still a lot of additional music we have to try out now that the acting is in place and I wonder when we will do it... It's getting tight. Since I had a lot of free time after the cancellation of the rehearsal, I decided to rip my studio apart and start to setup my new equipment. I know I should wait until after opening night, never should do that kind of stuff in the middle of a project, but I want to finish this as quickly as possible, as I am getting tired of my old studio. It was a nightmare. Millions of cables... But by midnight I was nearly finished and I can tell you: it's fantastic. I threw all of my old studio furniture out, I now have a small, clean table with my new MacBook Pro and the studio monitors on it, very clean, very tidy. Then about 12 Teras of new harddisk power in a cabinet and that's it. Brand new software: Mac OS 10.6.2, Aperture 3, Protools 8, Logic Studio 9, and a lot of positive energy to go along with it. It will take some time to get everything running smoothly, but I'm very optimistic. Rehearsal.. In the morning again rehearsals, then I spent most of the day, as I did yesterday, installing software on my new Mac. It's very time consuming, but well worth the effort. I'll be at the front of the pack again after falling back in the last 2 years. New sounds, new software, new OS. I love Macs, they're the best. Then I composed some new music for the play. Last minute adjustments so to speak. Another world... This morning we had a so called AMA in German, which means "Alles mit Allem", in English "All with all" meaning costumes, light, and makeup. It went pretty well, better than anticipated. We had our wigs for the first time and we locked hilarious. Interesting, most interesting really, was this: As you might remembr our clarinet player Mike has become an orthodox jew. He used to be a catholic, but converted to Judaism 10 years ago. For this rehearsal he had to shave and put on his wig. Within a few minutes all that was "jewish" about him has vanished. The clothes, the skull cap, the beard, the body language, everything. And why? Because it's not real, he's not Jewish. He looked like he looked 15 years ago, a boy from a small village in southern Germany...
