SOW INTO REVIVAL IN CHILE! This is a great opportunity for you to partner with what God is doing in this nation as a team of 11 of us travel there in March 2010. Eric Johnson will be leading our team as we get prophetic insight from God as to what He has on His heart for this nation. This has been a nation on Eric's heart for 12 years since he had a series of experiences where God "put Chile on the radar" for him.We will be going March 6-13, 2010. This is a strategic, pioneering trip that will be the first of a longterm relationship apostolically with Chile. As we get revelation from heaven on what Father wants to do, we will being mapping out where we will go and what will be engaged with.Would you like to be a part sowing into seeing a nation transformed? It can happen in a day, and it doesn't take but 1 who burns with the fire of God. Let God move you to burn for His move in Chile!If you would like to donate towards the trip, visit www.ibssm.org, and click Donate.
