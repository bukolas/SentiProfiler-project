Last year, I’d also received a one-liner from the same editor asking if I could review a tour for him. Since I wasn’t on location at the time, I recommended another writer who happened to be on location. The fellow writer took the tour and wrote up the much needed dispatch. For those who think travel writing needs to be a fiercely competitive cutthroat world of hoarding contacts, kindly read Julie’s fantastic post on Writers’ Karma. Time permitting and within reason of course, taking on last minute assignments is a great way of building continued trust and reliability between you and your editor. Meeting deadlines is extremely important as well. Always go with your intuition and negotiate an extra day or two upfront before you start writing, instead of later.
