A couple weeks ago Jason Croft of Sidetrack contacted me and requested an interview. I decided to do it. You can find the podcast of my interview with him here: http://will.illinois.edu/sidetrack February 2010 Before you click: * The interview starts around minute 5:00 and lasts about 10 minutes. * I was very nervous and so I stumble a lot! I am not a professional speaker and the project had only just begun. * When we chatted, I said my least favorite meal was pizza or hot dogs... But by that early point in the project I had yet to eat the PB&J, which is unequivocally the worst so far. * You can hear my toddler very, very faintly in the background off and on after minute 12:20. I was so focused on chatting that I didn't realize it.
