So today went really well which made me ecstatic. I barely smoked. I maybe had 3 again. I didn't have the urge to drink; the taste of alcohol is no longer in the back of my throat. I had full meals all day, which later on down the line will help with losing weight. 

There are two new goals I would like to this life changing choice.

One is:
Lose weight. I'm not unhappy with the weight I am currently at, but I know I could be smaller. So, starting tomorrow I am gonna start walking and watching what I eat. Eating healthy won't be an issue, because if I tell my mom that I want to start losing weight, she will buy me healthy food.

Two is:
Abstinence. Yes, that's right people. I am going to stop having sex. I am tired of guys only wanting sex. So from here on out, I'm going to truly see what it is that guys really want.


If you can't accept the above, please don't talk to me. This is decisions I have made that I will accomplish. They are all to prove to myself and to better myself.
