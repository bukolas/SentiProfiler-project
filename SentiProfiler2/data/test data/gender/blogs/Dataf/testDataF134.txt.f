I have been an artist most of my lifeâ€¦.Finger paints, play dough, coloring books and crayons. I could never get enough! As a teenager, I had the most amazing art teacher in high school. Her name was Mrs. Lucas. She believed every one of her students had talent. She introduced me to silk screening, pottery and watercolor. I enjoyed it all. As time went on, my attention drifted to antiquing. I found that I love vintage furniture, dishes, buttons, jewelry, quilts and linens. One day about 10 years ago, I saw the most gorgeous vintage dresser. It was painted white, and the top, sides and drawer fronts were covered with broken vintage china! Suddenly, every thing seemed to click. All the art classes and the years spent drifting around antique stores and flea markets just came together in the beautiful world of mosaics. I love repurposing old furniture, teapots, trays, birdhouses, old windows and even guest bath counter tops into beautiful and functional works of art.
