Off he heads, leaving behind his still-doting wife (Leslie Mann) in Texas, making for Miami where he falls for a handsome chap called Jimmy (Rodrigo Santoro) whom he showers with extravagant gifts he can’t afford. Eventually, the police catch up with him and he’s sent to jail where he falls even more madly for young, softly-spoken Phillip (Ewan McGregor).

They will, he vows, never be apart. Even if that means, upon being released, pretending to be a lawyer to get his lover out of jail, blagging a job as a high-ranking financial executive to fund an opulent life for the two of them, upon being sent back to jail conning medics that he’s dying of AIDS the better to effect an escape plan.

He’s outrageous.

Yet, unlike Matt Damon’s serial deceiver in The Informant!, he doesn’t seem sad or pitiable. If he’s a monster, he’s a charming one. Perhaps he’s in the grip of a compulsion. Perhaps his desire to be and do everything for Phillip marks him as a power freak.

It’s hard though not to envy his energy and guile. After all, when you love someone don’t you move heaven and earth to be and do everything for that person? This isn’t a satire or a cautionary tale: it’s one of the most romantic, most inspiring films of recent years.

What makes it especially arresting is its frankness. It’s more queer than gay, avoiding the tragic homosexual themes of Brokeback Mountain, the stylised melancholy of A Single Man, or the activist agenda of Milk. When Steve tells Phillip he’s taken up golf, his immediate response is: “Golf? You’re a homosexual!”

There are scenes that depict kissing, sweatiness, and post-fellatio banter into all of which Carrey and McGregor, though they don’t seem 100 per cent compatible, throw themselves whole-heartedly.

That whole-heartedness has its drawbacks. Carrey, in his best performance for a long time, still struggles to rein in his urge to over-gesticulate. And Steve’s ardour, his inability to stop fabulating, becomes wearying.

Phillip may well be a kind soul — though his character needs fleshing out — but it’s hard to imagine how, if they’d lived together for a long period, he could have put up with Steve’s hyper-ness. Then again, as this witty, engaging film proves, love has its own strange logic.  I Love You Phillip Morris begins with the opposite of a disclaimer. The words “This really happened” appear on the screen.

Then, just to make sure you know you’re in for one of the most batty and scarcely believable biopics of recent times, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who together wrote and directed the film, add: “It really did.” Steve Russell (played by Jim Carrey) is a conman who makes Bernie Madoff look small time. He joins the police force in order to get access to documents that will let him track down the mother who gave him up for adoption as a young child. He’s a church organist and a married father-of-two who, following a car crash, embraces fully a fact that that he’s always known: he’s gay.
