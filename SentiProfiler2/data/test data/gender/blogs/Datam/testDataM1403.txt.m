A real sport..but beware..she will give back as much as what she takes...she has this intimidating aura about her..in TV rating terms..she is strictly not for the weak hearted..but once you get to know her from close quarters,she is so down to earth..she is well conversant with high quality English as well as petta baashai..I have never seen her turn sentimental.. even if someone tries to ..she just laughs it off..of late she has become one of my most trusted friend, philosopher,guide,confidant all rolled into one..( I bet she will giggle even for this)...she is someone whom I instinctively message or call when I am feeling low..she can really life your spirits up in no time.. has a good dressing sense..presents herself aptly..she is BOLD,BEAUTIFUL,CONFIDENT,TOUGH and different from most people that I have met.. she is an enigma.. hate her or love her.. you just can't ignore her..all the best KAVYA RAJAPPA.. and KEEP FIGHTING!:)
