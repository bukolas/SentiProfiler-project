After a controversial delay in release last fall, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fourth collaboration Shutter Island has finally arrived. Only an acclaimed master like the man who brought us Raging Bull and Taxi Driver would be bold enough to adapt Dennis Lehane's 2003 best selling mystery and faithfully recreate its haunting tone and down right creepiness. Scorsese's talent for subliminally affecting his audience with his visual style is nearly unrivaled. There are many sights to behold in Shutter Island, some of them puzzling and others so bizarre that they may eventually find their way into your subconscious. What begins as a routine mystery soon evolves into a psychological trip. Set in 1954 U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive by ferry to Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts and home of Ashcliffe Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Summoned by Doctor Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carol Lynch), Teddy and Chuck must investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient. Ashcliffe might as well be considered a fortress, because it looks inescapable, yet Rachel Solondo, a woman who drowned her three children, managed to vanish the night before. Upon examination of her locked room, Teddy discovers no evidence of an escape and begins to speculate it could have been an inside job. A clue left behind by Rachel, that initially appear to be the scribblings of an insane woman, reveals itself to be a code called “the Code of Four” which Teddy will frequently encounter. After a fruitless search of the island, Teddy and Chuck discovers one of the staff members, a Dr. Sheehan, is also missing and speculate that he may have helped Rachel escape
