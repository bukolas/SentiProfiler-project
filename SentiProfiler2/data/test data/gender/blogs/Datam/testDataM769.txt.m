More Vegan and Vegetarian News at Vegan News - Health, Diet and Nutrition News Vegans should be protected from discrimination, says equality watchdog - Telegraph The Telegraph Reports; Miss Harman’s proposed Equality Bill would not change the law on religious beliefs, but the Commission is drafting the code at the same time in order to help employers interpret existing legislation. The draft code, currently under consultation, singles out vegans, who do not eat animal products or wear leather, as meriting protection from religious discrimination. It says: “A person who is a vegan chooses not to use or consume animal products of any kind. That person eschews the exploitation of animals for food, clothing, accessories or any other purpose and does so out of an ethical commitment to animal welfare.”The code says the current definition of “belief” also included “a lack of belief”, giving protection to atheists. Tony says; If anything vegans have even more conviction, dedication and focus on their philosophy than many other followers of beliefs. Vegans would suffer the same if not more emotional distress as any member of a religious group if they were punished for their beliefs. Veganism is more altruistic too there's no dangling carrot of heaven or vahalla or threat of hell if you don't adhere. If you're Jewish and eat prawn and bacon sandwiches and work on the Sabbath you're still Jewish. If you are Catholic and wear condoms, commit adultery, eat bacon on Fridays, kill and maim people and work on a Sabbath you are still a Catholic. You can't eat bacon sandwiches any day of the week and still be a vegan! (unless it's Redwood's cheatin bacon) It's quite right that human rights and anti discrimination law should protect a group who are dedicated to selflessly trying to protect people, animals and the environment.

That's why it's been moved to Hove so expert ethical caterers can be brought in. The Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre March 20th 2010 at The Hove Centre Some of the UK’s finest veggie food producers gather together at the first ever Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre on Saturday March 20th from 11am – 6pm, with the organisers expecting thousands of people through the door to experience the delights of one of the UK’s fastest growing lifestyle choices – the veggie diet. Some choose to be veggie on health grounds, others because they are concerned about the welfare of animals, but a growing number of people from all backgrounds are going veggie for one reason only – the food! Veggie food has long since shed the earnest but rather dull hippy image of the 70’s, and with leading UK veggie caterers at the Brighton Eco Veggie Fayre including the likes of V Bites, Heather Mill’s flagship Hove based restaurant, alongside food producers with the likes of the award winning Fry’s and Redwood ranges available to sample free, there’s a huge choice to be had. ‘Visitors to the show will be spoilt for choice when it comes to what to eat’ says the organiser Tim Barford from Bristol based hemp firm Yaoh. ‘There’s an incredible selection of really tasty food on offer and all of it is 100% plant based. We have up to 80 stalls at the event with some amazing products on offer, including bodycare and clothes, plus loads of information – it’s a really good way to find out just how good the veggie lifestyle can be.’ With a talks room, a cookery demos area, and an entertainments arena as well as an all day licensed bar, there’s a full line up to suit all tastes and with an admission price of just £3 for adults and £1 for kids and OAP’s, Tim is expecting a full house. ‘There’s a real increase in interest in anything eco friendly and especially in Brighton and Hove, which has the biggest population of veggies anywhere on the planet’ add Tim,’ and with such an excellent variety of products, food, experts and information available, its going to be a busy day.’ It’s not all fun and games though – there are some serious issues at stake, and the keynote speech at the event looks at Global Food Security, and in particular the effect livestock farming has on developing countries. ‘We are very pleased to have Dr Stephen Walsh from the Vegan Society at the show to deliver this vital talk’ says Tim. ‘We have to remember we are all responsible for what happens next on this planet.’ www.brighton.ecoveggiefayre.co.uk The show is organised by Yaoh and sponsored by Beanie’s Health Foods, V Bites, Chunkies and Macrobiotic Shop, and supported by Excellart, Ethical Singles, VeggieVision, Foods for Life and Flax Farm Linseed.

"I'm not a vegetarian but......." "I don't eat much meat..."/ "I'm almost vegetarian" / "I just eat fish and a little chicken" Despite the urge you occassionally may have to shake these people you should try to remember that it is these well meaning but non commital stand on the fence vegetarian spectators that keep vegetarianism and veganism moving forward. Without the vegetarian spectators, vegan dippers and semi - conscious consumers the fully conscious consumers and vegans who get it (get the fact that ill health and devastation of the planet are mostly down to eating the wrong way) would have a much harder time. All those soya, rice, nut and oat milk dairy alternative products and veggie sausages wouldn't be still so abundant on the shelves were it not for all the part time healthy eaters and environmentalists trying to do their occassional bit. Granted it is fast approaching the point where a bit is not enough to save the planet, but even a bit is better than nothing when it is millions of people. So Thank you Gwyneth Paltrow and your Goop blog - "I'm not a vegetarian but..." is pretty lame, especially considering your husband's passion for logic and reason. I'm no longer a fan of yours since you draped yourself in fur but....... thank you for plugging Paul McCartney's meat free monday and laying down the facts for your celebrity and fashion obcessed followers.
