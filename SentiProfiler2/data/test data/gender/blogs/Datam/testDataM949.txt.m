So it's a fantastic day outside. A balmy 42 degrees (47 tomorrow!), the sun is shining down its rejuvenating brilliance and I couldn't be more pleased about it. It's nice to just stand in the sunlight, close your eyes and tilt your head back a little. It feels like I imagine a hug from god would feel.
Still, I can't stay outside all day; the dishes won't do themselves after all. There are chores to be done and fantasy hockey teams to prep once again now that the Olympics are done. 
I can't help but to look at the news before going to my fantasy teams because I still feel it important to know what is going down on my planet even though the tao teaches mindlessness over mindfulness. Or as the ape savior Jesus teaches: do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Good stuff. 
But I do worry. Not so much about me but about all the rest of you humans out there. Can't help it. Every human alive should have the same right to be left alone that I used to have back when America was still a free country. But around the world disasters strike, American troops are shooting the hell out of some Afghanis and China is playing a game of chess with the entire planet. Checkmate will come when our nation yields world supremacy to them. Well, unless we Americans nuke the crap out of the planet. Then it's Kobayashi Maru.
I get mad about this because it didn't have to be this way, but greedy men with dreams of riches and lust for power brought have brought this nation to it. Both sides are to blame but since 1968 American policy has almost been entirely driven by the Republican party.
Nowadays those failed policies still haunt and reverberate through the highest levels. The current President still follows them. Bill Clinton followed them for the most part. Jimmy Carter never had an option but to follow them.
