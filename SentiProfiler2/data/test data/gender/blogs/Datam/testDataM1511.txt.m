Sebastian has Down Syndrome and requires more attention than most babies. Among other things, he has to be fed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, even through the night. Mindy knew his parents could use a break. So she volunteered to hold him for a while. She sang him to sleep. Mindy would be the first to tell you it's a God thing. Yep! I think it's just beautiful! And so does little Sebastian!
