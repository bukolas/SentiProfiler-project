I have known Ramya for the past 4 yrs and she's one of my very good friends at SSN...to describe her, she is Ms. Cool, Ms. Confident and Ms. Theramai of EEE B. Has a great spirit...She always tries to give her best in whatever she tries, ends up with great mokkais most of the times... Often a target of bantering in our class...but she never has bothered about these and endures everything with a silly smile...Few could match her dress sense...pink, red, orange being some of her favourite colors...you could easily point her out in any crowd for she stands out with her color sense...Has this habit of using words like altruism, philanthropist, etc. often in slam books and testimonials and only god knows if she knows the meaning of these words...I have enjoyed her company in all vetti and crazy activities we've done viz tours, IVs, symposiums, so called 'operations' and will always cherish those moments...All the very best in whatever u do...
