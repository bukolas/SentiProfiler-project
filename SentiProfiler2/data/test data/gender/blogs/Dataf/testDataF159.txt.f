The day after tomorrow is my ROM, and my friend Joan just told me I'm the most relaxed bride ever. Other than physically going to get my hair dyed and buying my own shoes/gloves/hat, I was virtually kiao kah-ing (relaxing; not doing a thing) the entire time!! AND THAT'S COZ I HAD THE MOST FABULOUS, EXPERIENCED AND HELPFUL PEOPLE making my wedding happen!!! See that's the shitty thing about most of life's most exciting and memorable events - you don't get a freaking rehearsal. Wedding? Most of us hope to only do it once, and with that one chance you've got to do it right. Giving birth? Won't pop out twice. Losing your virginity? Most likely not very pleasant with no experience. And therefore, when it comes to weddings... Relax. Don't try to control every single detail since you are likely to be really ignorant about most things anyway! Let the right people handle it for you and just go for the ride! It should be fun! Ok lah fine I'm only saying that coz I have the most ridiculously efficient and awesome wedding planners EVER. Wedding planners are so bloody important... Even if it costs extra, don't scrimp on it man!! Who wants to fuss over nitty gritty to throw a wedding?? Headed by Vernetta Lopez (REMEMBER?? UNDER ONE ROOF!!! DENISE!) who surprisingly enough opened a wedding planning company.There were a few companies (like 5 in total) interested to sponsor wedding planning for me but man, Eternally Yours really, really impressed. Like bowled me over. Gillian (manager) asked the wedding planning companies to try to come up with vendors who were willing to sponsor wedding necessities for me.Lois from Eternally Yours was so on the ball and just kept throwing suggestions and ideas on venues, themes, etc etc. THAT's what we brides really need. (Smacks table top assertively) Sometimes it gets so tiresome and we just think "What the fuck am I doing? Why am I doing all these tedious, expensive shit? Don't get married lah, fuck it." And then it's like the men are so disinterested! Mad sian. I'm sure ALL brides felt this way at least once. We just need fervid enthusiasm and ideas and positivity from someone who knows how to handle everything. It just keeps us going, you know? And suddenly it's something fun again, something to look forward to. The event of a lifetime. :) Within literally freaking HOURS Eternally Yours contacted sponsors and were telling me that responses were good but yet to be finalised... In the end... They found... Photographers... Gowns... Venue... Food... EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING IS SPONSORED. I even suspected they used black magic coz it's really not easy to convince vendors to give out sponsorships, especially since I'm no Fann Wong!! I was so bloody touched I really was damn close to like crying or something!!! Sob sob. Why do I always meet the best people? (In contrast another wedding planning company told me she cannot get sponsors. Not even 1! WTF!! Your aptitude needs a check.) If you need a wedding planner, use Eternally Yours!!
