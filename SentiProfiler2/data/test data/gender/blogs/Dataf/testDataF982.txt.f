Its 1:30am and I'm sitting here thinking about my life and how its about to change for the better! In a couple months my baby boy will be here in my arms and as I think of that, things start to race through my mind. How am I gonna raise him to be a gentlemen and treat girls with respect, how am I gonna send him to college, what if something goes wrong? And so many more things are run-in through my mind. I've realized that he is my number one and he his my child and no one is gonna change that. I have to do my best to protect him and give him the best life possible! Camdon, I know he's gonna be a good dad! Burger king fuckked him over bad and he went out the next day and got another job cause of our baby! We both want our baby boy to have the best life and were gonna make it happen! We decided to name the baby karson lowell lee legeman. We have had so many people ask us why karson or why lee lol. We picked karson cause of my dad. My dad has been there for me through thick and thin! Lowell is my grandpas middle name and every day I wish he was here to meet his great grandson! Lee is camdon grandfathers name and we decided to put it in the name because his grandfather has been there when his dad wasn't. I just want everyone to know that we love this baby and karson, mommy and daddy love u and we can't wait for u to come into our lives and make this world a better place! Things are changing and so are camdon and I but its for the better! Karson, we love u baby boy!
