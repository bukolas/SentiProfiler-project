I've written before about how I'm now at the age where I've become part of an obvious "targeted demographic" when it comes to television commercials and advertisements. Being in my mid-40's I am in prime shape to be taken in by ads that promise everything from being able to re-grow hair to being able to "be ready" for up to 36 hours, should I choose to become intimate with someone.
