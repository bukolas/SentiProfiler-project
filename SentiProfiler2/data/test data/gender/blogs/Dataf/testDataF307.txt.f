Call me crazy, but I'm not worried about my health. The other meals I eat during the average day are healthy. I have the money to make good meals for my family that are from fresh and frozen ingredients, many organic. So I actually think it's funny that people are concerned about me. Thank you, I'm doing fine (and it's only day 10). Also I really don't have lofty goals for my cash-strapped district's limited resources. I simply want school administration to be more reflective about what they are serving the children they don't want to fall "behind" (NCLB inside joke). I mean, would it hurt the district's meal planners to offer the occasional yogurt to the kids? I want less pre-fab food and higher quality options. Less crap, you know?
