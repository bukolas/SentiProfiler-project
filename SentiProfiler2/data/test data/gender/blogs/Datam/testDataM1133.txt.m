Maiden Walk - Flow of the wind seemed to halt
It was a mere glance ready to waltz
Confused for a second,I asked a question
Are they her eyes or two oceans
Divine those eyelids envisaged being grace
Altered to lissome as they glimpsed my face


An hour has passed,with no moment to spare
Waiting for our buses with heart refusing to dare
Adorned dusk amplified by the dulcet rain
But I am in loss and those aqua drops in gain
Bestrewed was that coy face with water droplets
And those bare arms seemed eager to melt


Now my heart is nothing but a hostage
Was it almighty who set up this stage
My foot rebelled and I knew not the path
But I was ensconced in the alluring swath
Distance between us is now less than a feet
This visceral journey made me ready to greet


That angelic face is touched by my hand
And my lips are over her humble eyes
Being Witnessed by several constellation
We are now each others destination
