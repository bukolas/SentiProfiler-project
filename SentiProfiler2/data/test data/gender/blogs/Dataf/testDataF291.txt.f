We demand the universal human rights standard of informed consent for all medical interventions. Compulsory vaccination cannot be legally and morally justified. We affirm...the sanctity of personal space the right to be left alone, and the freedom to make personal health care decisions guided by the professionals of our choosing. We invite all people, families and organizations committed to protecting these fundamental rights to stand with us in downtown Chicago on May 26, 2010 at our inaugural rally, and to work with us after the event to support grassroots advocacy, education, and leadership in defense of our personal â€“ individual, legal, moral, religious, civil, and human -- rights. The American Personal Rights Rally coincides with Autism One and Generation Rescue's conference, Autism Redefined, May 24th through May 30, 2010 at the Westin O'Hare in Chicago.
