My 13 year old son has bad phone karma. This year he has dropped his cell phone in the toilet...and in a storm drain. The most recent folly was the storm drain last weekend. His cell phone was in his pocket...and as he got into the car, it slipped out and fell onto the street and into the storm drain. The look on his face was tragic. Then the desperation kicked in.&nbsp; We attempted to retrieve the phone with a golf-ball grabber thingy, a rake, and we even considered holding my 8 yr old upside down and lowering him into the sewer... but, no phone was retrieved. The last act of desperation was a call to the City of McKinney the next morning. And lo and behold, the city send out...Storm Drain Sal. A petite man who slid into the storm drain man hole and saved the phone...which still worked, amazingly. Wonder what else he's saved out of our city sewers? My 13 yr old son plays in the middle school band. And we rent his trombone from a local music store, Music &amp; Arts . I realized this week I'd skipped a payment. Accidently. As I hurried to make the phone call in order to get caught up on payments...it occurred to me that there might be a musical mafia.&nbsp; I didn't want to have to get a loan from a shylock...or get iced. Maybe, if there is a musical mafia, they put the hit out on my son...they outsource...and use bullies from the local middle school to collect. I'd feel so guilty. We're paid up though. Donny can play his trombone safely.&nbsp; I know, sometimes I think too much. And follow too many rabbit trails.&nbsp; I'm weird like that. When I was younger, we read a book at school about a man who paints houses for a living but dreams of far away places.&nbsp; When he sees a movie about Antarctica, he is so fascinated that he writes to Admiral Drake, an explorer there. Instead of answering the letter, the Admiral sends a large wooden box with holes punched in the sides. When Mr. Popper removes the outer boards, out jumps a full grown penguin. From then on, his days are filled with one adventure after another. This book began my love affair with penguins . I had a stuffed penguin that I slept with for years, and I named him Captain Ork.&nbsp; (Ork being the sound a penguin makes) Tonight, watching the Olympics women's ice dancing short programs, I was reminded of one of my favorite animals once again. And by a little known fact I recently discovered about them. The King Penguins have an organ above their eyes that convert salt water to fresh water. So, they can drink salt water. How amazing is that?! All the answers we're looking for in science...are in the animal kingdom. Seriously.&nbsp; This kid is so cool. He has every NERF gun possible. He's smart and sweet. He's super athletic, but also loves video games. He's a little tightly wound at times, but he's my sweet Remy. Next up: Donny got his braces off! Woohoo!! My take on the Oylmpics Opening Ceremony : The most vivid image I was left with after Friday night was a guy flying over wheat fields and flannel-wearing, tattoo-covered, grunge fiddling tap dancers . Canada, you are strange, but in a friendly-dorky kind of way. I was kind of disappointed Celine Dion didn't end up naked in a maple syrup fountain. The indigenous dancers had to dance for an hour straight. Because we haven't done enough to them by taking their land and such. And slam poetry? Wow. That was unique!! Overall, it was a bizarre event, and really, really long. Canadians are either really deep...or really high . Not sure which. and all that money (30-40 Million!)&nbsp; spent on the opening ceremony could have gone to something more impressive...like helping Haiti or some other third-world country. That would have said a lot more, in my book. But, I love the Olympics ! And I love reading all the twitter commentary on it. I'm taking my Valentines to get haircuts...because I can no longer see their eyes. And then we're going to see a movie. Probably the new Percy Jackson movie Lightning Thief . Because my older son and I have read all the books and LOVE the series. What are your plans? They aren't sure where Mozart's body is buried. Polar Bears are left-handed. Butterflies taste with their feet. Cows have four stomachs. Horses cannot vomit. A crocodile cannot stick out its tongue. Most people cannot lick their elbow. Which of those statements astonishes you the most? An aptly named abandoned boat!! Actually, that's not my attitude at all. I always care. Perhaps too much. I care about the now homeless people in Haiti. I care about my family. I care about the people I work with and our clients . I care about what I want to do with my life and that it matters somehow. Caring makes things harder. and more challenging. But totally worthwhile.
