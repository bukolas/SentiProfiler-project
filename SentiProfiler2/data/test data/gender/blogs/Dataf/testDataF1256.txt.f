hehehehhhhuhuhhuuhhahhahahhhaa oh shit! hehhehahahhhahhahahah chuck it! hhohhhohohhahahahahhahaahhah. thts rad for u. my substitute sis in atlanta :) rad is a fun loving devil child who can laugh till her insides explode. thats a good thing though coz the jokes she cracks can seem funny to none but her!! Shes a simbu fan ( i still dunno who that is!!) my tamil tuition teacher and a gal who jes luvvs dressing up. no tuesday or thursday is complete widout us going to raid the klaus kitchens of all the hot chocolate available! must say the hot choc definitely helps stem the flow of her polambal on special prob. shes also my suttufying partner n ive lost count of the number / value of items we've flicked from career fair n the no. of places we've had free pizza (in other depts!!)
if u ever stop by her place, she'll neva let u leave wid an empty stomach, if not dinner ull surely get some cold coffee.. she cooks amazing dal.
ohh n if u ever wanna spot her in atlanta, luk for the phataak red shoes she wears. :p
