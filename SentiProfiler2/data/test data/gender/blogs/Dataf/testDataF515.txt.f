decided to follow your words...committed to write your testimonial... so will do it though backing out is a much easier option! ok...lets get going... to start with, he's the most humble guy i've ever met. has got loads of tricks up his sleeve but doesn't look it one bit. U can look up to him as a role model for success, an avatar of sincerity or watever... but beyond his career and academic achievements, talents and brains lies a very helping, friendly and supportive person. he says he wants to do an MBA... but the way he speaks ull feel like he's a lecturer for MBA... god he knows of all the possible mgmt principles on earth...lol.. never say 'i know' to him or else ud have to hear a bigger lecture than what ud have if u dint know:-P and dont let my testi create any preconceptions about him in ur mind coz that's a terrible mistake too:-) likes to keep smiling all the time... for me he's been a great friend and an elder brother to look up to anytime
