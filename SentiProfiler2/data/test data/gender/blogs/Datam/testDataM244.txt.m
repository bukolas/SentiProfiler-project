The first few days of the Big East Tournament haven’t disappointed with a host of thrilling games already in the books. Georgetown today dethroned the mighty Syracuse Orangemen at Madison Square Garden 91-84, thanks to a epic 27-point performance from junior forward Chris Wright. The #3 ranked Orangemen were also dealt a potentially crucial blow going into March Madness with Arinze Onuaku suffering an injury to his knee. Last night Cincinatti kept their NCAA Tournament dreams alive by upsetting Rick Pitino’s Louisville Cardinals 69-66. Marquette won two tight games against St. John’s and Villanova to advance to semi-finals with the Hoyas. Even the early game was exciting with Seton Hall outlasting Providence in a game where over 200 points were scored.
