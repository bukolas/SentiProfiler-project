I am becoming intense. It isn't a goal. I don't have a plan toward achieving intensity. It's an observation.

I didn't start out this way. I was laid back and relaxed for what I think was most of my life. In fact, there was the time my golf coach encouraged me to develop a temper and some intensity. A Sr. Minister with whom I worked said I didn't take my mistakes seriously.

A lot has changed. I've changed. I am becoming intense.

So, I am looking for peace this coming week. I am intentionally seeking silence and peace. I will listen more and speak less. I will think before I react. I will be less intense. I will practice the Divine Hours. I will remember serenity. I will look to be more at peace.

I make a promise to myself.I seem to march into quandaries. I don't think I do it consciously, but the result is the same as if I willfully looked for trouble. It worries me.Tomorrow is the primary here in KY. It's irrelevant at this point it seems. The DNC has really messed this whole process up to the point to where a stalemate was bound to occur. Still, I am going to the poll tomorrow and I will cast a ballot. I can't bring myself to believe that any vote is irrelevant in a nation that depends on participation.
