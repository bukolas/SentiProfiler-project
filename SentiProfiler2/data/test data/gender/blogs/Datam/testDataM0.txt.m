happy teachers day..!! who is celebrating..??


I had already heard dis when i was still too young,
" good friends and good teachers are rare fortunes"

....teaching is of course the most noble profession.. and future of any nation lies in hands of it's teachers..!!

today.. morning of 5th sept.. i m angry..!! don't know exactly why.. dere may be several reasons, like..
.........in few hours i have to give my second monthly test,
..........m totally stuck at 10th level of segreta!!
............i have not slept the whole night,
...............today is 5th sept..!!
happy teachers day.. !! am sorry to all my dear teachers who have taught me.. but i m not being able to show any excitement about this..

may be because i am angry.. or may be i am angry because of that only..!!!
still.. before i say anything else..
thank you all my so good and so great teachers.. for what i am today is only a reflection of your thoughts, labour and love.. i miss u all..!!

....now, i dont want to spoil my mood early morning by thinking about issues regarding this.. but i really feel very disappointed with the education system.. n teachers in our country..!!
n i really dont need to say anything.. we already know.. how pathetic
situations are..
i just want to draw our attention once again towards the "architects of our county's future.. " and call for a thought and contribution on your part.. coz if not we.. then no one!!
"seems.. today we want to do noble work only if we are not left with anything else.. "

aah.. thinking about this really irritates me..!! cudn't stop to express dat..!! dere4 dis post..!!
