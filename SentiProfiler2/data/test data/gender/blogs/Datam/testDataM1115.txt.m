Academic: I seek to foster a research environment and culture at an undergraduate level, knowing that good undergraduate students make good graduate candidates. I wish to instill in the younger generation the desire to produce quality results that are cutting edge in their field of work.Personal: I am interested in fostering a healthy non-academic environment in which students can participate. A healthy dormitory life can be just as important as the availability of a quality education to the overall outcome of a student. I enjoy the non-academic activities available for student interaction and growth.I enjoy reading and constantly exploring new ideas and technologies from all different fields. More often than not I have been inspired by knowledge of advances in ancillary fields when attempting to solve problems in my own.Taught my first course in the Fall Qtr. 2006, undergraduate Transport Phenomena. The following spring I taught my first graduate course, Graduate Transport Phenomena, then in Fall 2007 I taught Biomechanics, Winter 2007 I helped to teach Senior Design Laboratory for engineers. This last year I assisted for most of those classes again. I have found what I love to do.Have been involved in research since 2001, and look forward to a lifelong involvement in academia. I doubt I will head back to an industry-life, but life has taught me that I can never predict exactly where it will take me
