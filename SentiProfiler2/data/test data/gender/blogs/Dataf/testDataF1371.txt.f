:: nesting newbies :: :: destined to design :: :: the drifter and the gypsy :: :: sweet fine day :: :: yatzer :: ok so here's the real deal, I am obsessed with my blogroll! ok, not the literal roll but the incredible blogs listed on it! and not because I think they are great but because I think they are great and I enjoy them, I am inspired by them and I happily follow them daily. my blogroll is not just a place to share what I love to read with you lovelies but a place for me to actually sort out what I love to read. i have a little method - I bookmark inspiring blogs and sites and then update my blogroll every few months so I don't lose them in my - what I thought was a streamlined - bookmarking system. I realized a few weeks ago that all of my bookmark folders have, oh, tons and tons of sites marked and I can (sadly) lose track of what I actually bookmarked to enjoy. I just updated my blogroll ( now over 165 sweet blogs and sites ) with a bunch of new fab additions and wanted to share a few with you - they are lovely!! enjoy, support, love and inspire. nesting newbies :: new online lifestyle magazine run by two amazing women with a spread of food, entertaining, home design and more. and the online mag has streaming video in the articles - super creative. destined to design :: an la gal that is inspired everyday and shares it through her lovely blog. the drifter and the gypsy :: the sweet micaela's blog is full of design, photography and cool words. she also happens to be a recent Blog Out Loud panelist . sweet fine day :: an owner of a confectionery's blog?! yes! sweet, pretty and lovely photos to boot. yatzer :: my new fave innovative and eclectic "finger on the pulse" design mag that curates cool stuff. :: all images from their respective blogs :: last week at Blog Out Loud 5 , one of the lovely items in our goodie bags were cookies, generously donated from Sweet Ambs . ok, people, these cookies are -seriously- gorgeous! I felt bad eating it (but I did :) I especially love the cameo cookie and was inspired to pull another banquette seating image, one of my fave small space ideas. Spring is almost here and I am so excited for sunny long days and San Francisco fun! :: cookies by Sweet Ambs and kitchen by decorpad :: it's such a pretty day in San Francisco today and spring is on it's way! I have been thinking about coral and white - clean, romantic colors that feel good all the time. I love this striped pillow from Williams-Sonoma Home. Changing out your throw pillow covers is an easy and affordable way to change the entire vibe of your small space.&nbsp; Many of us have family heirlooms and fond knick knacks in our small spaces. I definitely believe in creating a home with items that make you feel good! Another way to create a vibe is to include furniture and decor that sparks inspiration. I am loving these colorful side tables with vintage cigar vignettes. They remind me of an outdoor cafe in Paris! Oh la la! What do you have in your small space that creates a certain vibe and/or style? :: top image via Flickr/d'alk and the other two by me :: Looking forward to seeing you there!!&nbsp; And if you want to follow us live, you can starting around 7pm PST! Just head over to - twitter.com/blogoutloud or #blogoutloud Check out the BOL blog tomorrow for photos and recaps from tonight's event! i love that line in the Sex and the City episode when Carrie is writing for Vogue and she makes a comment about not "having a {vague} idea". When I was about in my new city, I spotted this neat backdrop featuring vintage Vogue covers and had to share it with you guys. How neat would this be framed, leaning against a wall? Or hung on wall as a backdrop to a desk area? I bet this could be an easy DIY too. Just find some vintage magazine images and make your own collection. Call a sign company and see how much it would be to print the size you need. Hmmm, more to come on this one in my own small space!&nbsp; like many of you, I heart target! i get lost in the aisles of goodies and love their designer series across the board. plus they have the best pomegranate scented candles - yes! I just spotted these exclusive keys on their site , thought they were super cute and wanted to share with you guys. often overlooked, your key ring is your first step into your small space so add a key ring that makes you happy!&nbsp; lately I've been seeing a new crop of x-benches popping up with a more industrial vibe and really am considering this look - love it! there's something classic about this style yet the it's accessible and cool! plus these pieces double, or even triple, in small spaces. i am loving the x-inspired bench that I spotted recently on a blog I recently discovered, Good Bones, Great Spaces. I love the placement under the window and that it's a bench more then an ottoman. actually, one of my first Apartment Therapy posts was about x-inspired furniture . :: image via Good Bones, Great Spaces ::
