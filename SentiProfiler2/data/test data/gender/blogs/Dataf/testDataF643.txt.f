i see a lot of eclipses in this painting by wassily kandinsky, although he called it several circles.i think it would be cool to have a first name like "wassily." his work reminds me of my grandmother's paintings.  i like the bold geometric forms and colors.he manages to express the romance of a circle.  i went to the lenbauchaus in munich, germany one time and was mesmerized by the shapes in this massive painting...... and the colors of this one.
