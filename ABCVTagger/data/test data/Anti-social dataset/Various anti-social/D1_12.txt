When I'm really mad .. (quite often)

I explode like a volcano lol

My face turns red and my voice rises up like an Opera singer ..

I hate it !

I get so mad about stuff. So angry that i can actually feel my blood pressure rising. I get so irritated with people that I have a hard time being pleasant sometimes (although, I don't usually freak out on complete strangers like today). I thought about going to a hypnotist .... I wonder if that would work. I really don't have a clue how to control this. I am not going on any stupid medication which I don't think helps the true problem, just curbs a symptom. I just had to get this off of my chest.
