I wanted to write a thing about this picture here since November last year. This picture here was published in TOI on 29th Nov 2009. Yes, 3 days after the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai... India rather. England Cricket team was on a tour of India.
You can see in the picture, England captain being guarded by a commando while the captain is on the street heading towards his Hotel I presume. Well the thing that strikes me is, What if a terrorist had tried shooting the Captain? The man in the 'line of fire' is not the captain but the Guard yo see in-front of him. The questions that hit me is, What creates this Difference in class? What makes the life of the Captain more precious than that of the guard?
The captain may be good with hitting the ball on a 'Life-friendly' playground. But the guard is also great with protecting lives, protecting nation with his accurate aim on the enemies. Leave the so called 'hero of a nation' on a battle field, he is helpless as a fly caught in a web. So the brain(in this case, the talent) is not a thing that differentiates. Is it that the captain wears an Adidas jacket and the guard a cheap military cloth? That the captain gets a thousand dollar haircut in fashion and the guard a home made one?
Both have their own occupations. Each specialized in their own skills. According to me, the commando here is a much more socially responsible person than the captain. So, what makes the captain's life more worthy than that of the commando? Imagine if both die in a terrorist attack. The death of the captain will be a great loss(world shock) for years. But no one will bother to remember the name of the commando except for their 'Below Poverty Line' family!!!
