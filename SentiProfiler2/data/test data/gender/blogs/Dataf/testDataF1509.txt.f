I do not seem to be able to stay current with anything lately and blogging has been the worst. I am trying to keep up with assignments in my Web Design class, keep my lia sophia business afloat, which means calls and organization and keeping up with paper work, trying to keep my house clean and attempting to get some long overdue redecorating done. Which brings me to this picture? 
Remember when my son moved home for 6 months and we repainted his room in the color of his choice? Well this room is now my office (with another cardboard creation homework assignment from Sadie's art teacher stored here). It is BRIGHT! Not in a good way.
