So if yall dont know i finnaly met somebody who completes me. her name is kendra willingham.just talking on myspace i didnt even imagine anything would happen like this.but so far everything is amazing.i love everything i mean everything about this girl.from her smile,her personality,her kisses and her beautiful looks.theres never a dull moment with this girl and i havent lost a single bit of interest in her every since i first saw her on myspace.you know i thought i loved someone before and you probably know who you are but nothing compares to the way i feel about kendra.its the best feeling in the world knowing no matter what i have done or what kind of day i am having i can always talk to her and every emotion im feeling goes away as soon as my phone lights up and im sure she can say the same.some might call it fate or a coincidence i just so happen to run across her profile while im doing my AIT down here in goodfellow afb but i KNOW it was meant to happen especially how everything just came together like it did.im going to let people talk and run their mouths because of our apparent differences but i know as well as she does im not going anywhere and either is she.call it puppy love,call it fatal attraction,hell call it whatever you want but i know its true love and i would not change a thing and i have no regrets so far. im very happy and excited to see really how far we go. but thats all i got to say. i love you kendra
