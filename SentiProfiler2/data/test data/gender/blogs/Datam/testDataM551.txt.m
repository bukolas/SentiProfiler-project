Yesterday i was sitting and waiting for few friends in a Chinese restaurant. Waiting is the annoying thing I happen to do very often since I am always ahead of time. So now my friends are partially to be blamed for my habit. I end up catching a conversation between a 40 something year old man and a 12 to 14 year old boy. The book I was trying to read was bad anyway. I heard the dad asking his son about school and friends. That grabbed my attention. The son patiently answered like he really wanted to share. How many teenagers do that? (Not like i am the 40 year old dad) Then the topic turned to women. Father asked if the son liked anyone in school. The son just giggled. I wanted to pull that kidâ€™s cheeks. Now lets just focus on non creepy side of me.
