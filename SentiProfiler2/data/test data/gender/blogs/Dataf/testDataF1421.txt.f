ve done a lot of research when it comes to dog food. I am not a dog owner that buys my dog cheap food that has potential to cause a lot of allergies. California Natural is one of the best, top of the line dog food you can buy. My dogs have the softest coats. I am a Doberman owner and I do not cheap out on my 'babies'. That being said, a large bag is close to $45-50 in Michigan. Furthermore, I have to drive about 25 miles to get a bag because the local pet stores (Petsmart, Petco) do not sell this line.
