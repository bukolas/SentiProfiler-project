Experience tells me we need to take this, hopefully temporary, yard art to an appropriate specialist. In this case, that would be an auto-electric shop. Experience has also taught me the damn thing needs to be running for them to do a diagnosis on it. I’ve been down that particular primrose path before. Without their equipment, they have to examine the entire electrical system, a very expensive process, and hope like hell they get lucky. If they don’t get lucky, Repair by Replacement goes into operation – another very expensive process. Two expensive processes do not equal an affordable bill.
