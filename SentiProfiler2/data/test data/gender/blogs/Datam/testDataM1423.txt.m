Between 2 friends, maybe very close or may not be close, they could just be friends. Assume that the guy has feelings for the gal all of a sudden. Like I said before, the guy decides to tell her. "Hey, I have started feeling differently about u lately... blah blah.... this is off topic" The gal if interested says 'Yes' and all is ll. OMG here comes the other if. NO??!!?? Ok now wats the next step. I have commonly seen the gal starting to distance herself from the guy. Cmon give him a break he is not gonna stalk you. Guys give her a break. She said NO which means any amount of hanging around doesnt work. So give up and atleast be sane enough to respect her feelings and her space.

If you are very close friends, give it a small gap, may be one or 2 days, call back and just be normal. DO NOT ATTEMPT to talk about wat happened unless u r sure, both u and her are comfortable talking about it. Otherwise, its best to avoid it. Agreed it is tough to start with. A few days, and u will be back to comfort zone and then probably, u will be able to discuss it in the lighter vein.

Ok, here goes. What is it about expressing love that people think its an offense? The guy had an 'opinion'. I use the word opinion just because its just precisely what it is. You go thro this phase where you think a person is special to you. Hence, its an 'OPINION' you form about the person. Freedom of Speech/ Expression(This I know is not applicable completely to something of this kind) but, I want to use this to play down the misconceptions surrounding the 'Opinion'.

The girl, you will accept/not accept an opinion about a car, bike, house, etc...etc... when the guy says it. Why is it when this opinion is expressed and then asked about ur take on it... you get so offensive??
He just said he loves you and wants you to be his 'ONE'. Just say whether you agree or not and get moving along. Yes, again a play down on the whole concept of expressing love.
