It sounds like that is what you have. I have achalasia. I am 26. I had surgery on the 6th of this month. You need to bring up achalasia to your doctors. It is a progressive disease---so yes, unfortunately it has gotten worse with age. They might suggest botox injections since you are a little older than myself but they might also suggest surgery---mine was done through my stomach----opposed to open surgery---I am still recovering but I believe that I will be fine---the only thing is that if you do the surgery do not do the botox treatments---it can cause scar tissue making the surgery more risky than it already is. I had one botox treatment a year ago to alleviate some of the symptoms---but the scar tissue was there and things could have gone very badly. Please heed my advice and call your doctor!
