The little copper tree and the wood on which it sits were sent to me by Aleph. I added the birthday candle and the little figures (about 1/2 inch tall). This twisting tree reminded me of the Wallace Stevens poem On the Road Home. I tried something pretty simple with this- instead of blending bits of the three photographs I liked, I just stacked them, I think this reflects the mood of mutability in the poem.Alice picks up the red king chesspiece, who does not know what force is lifting him through the air. Feeling at the mercy of forces beyond our control frequently results in reverting to the primitive (did someone say reptilian brain?).
