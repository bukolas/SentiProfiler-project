Lancs are through to Barbados T20 semi

Lancashire have just sneaked through to Finals Day of the Twenty20 competition at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.

The Red Rose county were made to work hard with the bat in their pursuit of 131 against a select XI from the host Island, but Tom Smith’s 48 was the mainstay of their reply. The Lightning won with three wickets and two balls to spare.

The left-hander looked upset at being given out caught behind when the ball seemed to loop up off his pad onto his gloves and through to the keeper.

I remember him telling me last year that he was gutted not to be there at the end of a win against Glamorgan at the SWALEC after doing all the hard work, and this was a similar circumstance.

Lancashire will now play Essex in the first semi-final early evening your time back home (5.30pm), while Roses rivals Yorkshire were the shock losers of the day. They went down by 58 runs to a University of the West Indies XI after being bowled out for 63!!

There were a couple of hundred spectators throughout the day at the impressive Kensington Oval, and there are a few more expected for the Finals Day tomorrow due to the fact that there is some home presence in the students.

There was a little bit of a worry for the Lightning, with skipper Glen Chapple taking a bang on his finger during fielding.

He only bowled two overs before leaving the field and letting Mark Chilton take over the leadership duties.

Chappie came back out to bat later on to help guide his side over the winning line, but Peter Moores said afterwards that he might not be fit to play in the semi and hopefully final of the Barbados Cricket Cup.

I remember the ex-England man tearing a hamstring in Sharjah last pre-season, but this injury doesn’t sound anywhere near as serious.
