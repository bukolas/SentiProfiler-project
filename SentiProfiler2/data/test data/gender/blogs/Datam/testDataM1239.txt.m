In sports, everyone is a winnerâ€”some people just win better than others. Like Michael David Barrett, Erin Andrews's peeper, who was sentenced yesterday to two-and-a-half years in prison and life as another triple-named American villain.

Maybe some J.D. out there (or, that failing, an ESPN.com commenter) can explain this to me. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real said the 30 months was the maximum he could've imposed, though a quick glance at the federal sentencing table would suggest that Barrett's term actually falls toward the low end. (Stalking carries a base offense level of 18, i.e. 27-33 months, though the fact that Barrett chased Andrews all across the Marriotts of America probably should've taken it up a couple of ticks). In any case, Andrews is not pleased:

    "I'm at the angry stage right now," the ESPN reporter and upcoming contestant on ABC's "Dancing With the Stars" said outside court.

    "I'm mad. Thirty months is not enough."

    [...]

    She blasted Barrett for claiming he should get leniency because he's paying for his guilty plea with public humiliation and spoke searingly in court about her own fear and suffering.

    "Let's talk about public humiliation, Mr. Barrett," Andrews said. "I'm living public humiliation. The picture on the Internet is mine, it's not his."
