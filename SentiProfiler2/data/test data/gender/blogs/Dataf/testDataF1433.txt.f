My charts are becoming real pieces of art these days.  My most recent work is the Gumball Chart, inspired by Chase's deep desire for a gumball machine in the house.  My kids don't chew gum at this point in their lives unless it's a special treat from Gramma, but I'm liking the idea of having one in the house for the sole purpose of rewarding super excellent behavior.  So, once all three of the gumball charts are filled, we'll head to the store to find a real life gumball machine of our own.
