by FERENC IVANICS We usually walk on roads with high traffic. We've seen a lot of things, but we think there are two hot-shots of the roadside : bottles filled with piss , tossed by truck drivers; used diapers tossed by parents. We've gotten used to their sight, I try to understand the habit but I can't really. I know it's smelly but there's at least two garbage cans in ten minutes drive. This one on the photo puzzled us: why a six-pack? Were there six babies? All had crapped at the same time? Was this a long-time collection? Still a mystery... In case you haven't noticed, news on this blog are not exactly real-time. There are two separate reasons. The boys don't have internet-enabled mobile devices (or service providers), they cannot post directly but with a delay (from internet cafes), which is sometimes a few days and in troubled periods can grow up to two weeks. Even though the language skills of Ferenc and István have improved a lot, they post in Hungarian. One of us from the background team translates and edits all the posts. This adds another delay to the process, an additional two or three weeks.

Soon we made clear that we weren't hitchhikers and didn't need a ride. Next day we found the place a German-Mexican guy had recommended us two months ago. He told us that the shore of the lagoon is clean ant the owner surely would let us stay for the night. So we had fought our way through the jungle, found the spot, a small bungalow and... a red car at the lake shore. Yep, the red car of that kind couple. The Bacalar Lagoon is and extremely pleasant place and its water is even cleaner. We took a refreshing swim in the blue freshwater lake and moved on the next day. by FERENC IVANICS On the eastern shore of the peninsula there's rocky coast as well. If you look closer, many of these rocks are dead corals. Sian Ka'an features the third longest coral reef of the world. Unfortunately we don't have the means to scuba-dive watching the colorful fishies underwater. On the other side of the peninsula there is a series of mixed-water lagoons. The water is crystal clear, so it's another preferred destination for scuba-divers . We managed to walk to Punta Allen in two days. Bu there came the twist: How to get across to Playón, which is nothing but a wooden stage, a small harbor for boats. To our surprise we found a volunteer almost immediately. After crossing the bay (one or two miles) he mentioned that he wouldn't reject a small payment. But we couldn't give him anything, we were broke. Literally. But he did take it well. From this point forward it was 40 miles of forest, totally uninhabited forest. Practically it was a 40 miles long tunnel. We lived on biscuits, milk powder and canned beans. We did have enough food for three days but definitely not enough water. On these parts of the reserve there's no coconut palms, so we could have gotten into trouble. There was almost no traffic on this road. On the second day we ran out of water , but then the skies opened up and small ponds began to form on the middle of the path. Thanks to our friend, Drew we had a water filter with us, so, we were saved. Trees, trees, trees. The longest walk we've had under trees. And these trees gave us some headache when we were looking for a camping spot. But since there was no traffic, we camped on the road. Not on the middle of it, but on the road. And on the third day we reached Felipe Carrillo Puerto. It was a great relief. Was it worth it? Sure!! Sian Ka'an, Part 1 by FERENC IVANICS From Tulum to Chetumal there's a paved road. But there's another path that takes you through the biosphere reserve Sian Ka'an . That is the major national park in the Caribbean, and it's been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987. Mostly made of huge palm forests, there's a peninsula with freshwater lagoons, a coral reef , etc. We knew many tourists visit this area from Tulum. And then come back to Tulum. We wanted to move on south after visiting Sian Ka'an . We didn't know if it was possible, so this choice was a bit risky, but we wanted to see what does the real, wild Caribbean looks like, without the signs of human civilization, huge hotels, crowded beaches, harbors. And Sian Ka'an is beautiful. There's a 35 miles long road from Tulum to Punta Allén, running on the peninsula between palm trees and mangroves , the sea is extreme blue, but there's too much litter running on shore... Our only trouble (besides the ever-present mosquitoes ) was drinking water. It wasn't serious though, I mean, we could have stopped a tourist convoy to ask for water anytime, but we turned to our most-honored coconuts. Wildlife is dense in Sian Ka'an, we've seen coatis , western red pandas , capybaras , small crabs living in shells, and there's pumas and jaguars as well in this jungle. But the most dangerous species we've met was that little crab with its heavy claws. Sian Ka'an, Part 2 by FERENC IVANICS Tulum is an authentic Caribbean holiday resort. It's expensive for us, but if you look at its beauties and compare the prices to other places, I'd say it's rather affordable , or even economical. There are a lot of young travelers, hippies, nature lovers here, they rent cheap bungalows or camp near the beach. We, by luck, ran into Chain and Jaime , they run a campsite near the Tulum beach. We can tell, that was the most exotic camping we'd ever seen . We passed two quite enjoyable days there (though you can't escape from the mosquitoes). This lovely couple told us we could stay for as long as we wanted, but we had things to get arranged in the town of Tulum. Thank you! by FERENC IVANICS Thanks to the helpful tourists in Playa del Carmen we bought a new pair of tents . Our fourth pair on our 8000 miles walk. We bought two Jeep Hiker Tents , these are pretty strange tents but they seem strong enough, ant that's what's important for us. They chipped in enough to buy some new socks and pants as well. Due to the almost expired visas our days were counted in Mexico . We were expecting to receive new shoes from the U.S. so we arrived in Tulum full of hope. Thank you for your support. by FERENC IVANICS We stopped at Playa del Carmen, some 40 miles south of Cancún. Found a deserted go-kart track and made a base camp there. Our tents are full of holes , our clothes aren't any better. Playa del Carmen is full of tourists, Canadians, Europeans, from the U.S.A... The city is full of bars, shops, restaurants, it's a pleasure factory. We just sit on the 5th avenue with a WorldWalk-board. Two bearded guys in identical clothes, looks interesting. Many passer-byes are curious about us and we always chat with them, usually mentioning the situation with our tents and clothes. We get some small donations and even some major help, like the support from the Hungarian Tukarcsy family. (We met other Hungarians as well: many thanks, Marcsi, Szilvi, Balázs and Tamás.) It was a special experience spending New Years Eve at the beach, taking a swim. The water was clean and calm. I guess I don't have to say anything about the blue seawater... We enjoyed it a lot, and it was nice to see how grown-ups unveil their inner child . by FERENC IVANICS We reached the Caribbean at Cancún. I guess most of you have seen pictures of the blue Caribbean Sea . I always thought those were images altered in Photoshop, a computer generated exaggeration. We've seen the Mediterranean of the French and the Spanish, The Atlantic in Africa and in Miami, the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. and in Mexico. Their beaches were playing in another league . This is something totally different. The color of the water is amazing. So it's not surprising that Cancún is the "capital" of tourism is Mexico. An 18 miles long beach sprinkled with luxurious hotels that suit your every need... Well, we think it's interesting but very distant from us.
