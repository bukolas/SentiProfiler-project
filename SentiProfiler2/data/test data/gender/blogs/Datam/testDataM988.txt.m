I try to work hard - enough to keep my wife, Bria at home, so she can take the best care of our two kids, Rhys and Ammie. I love my job. Seriously. I like to help people with what I can. I enjoy good discussions, great jokes, well-written scripts in movies with good acting and directing. I have a great appreciation for the little things that make me smile; cold beer, pizza, lasagne, sunshine, summer, anything non-winter, shiny power tools, green forests, fishing, camping, good loud music, people who are honest and loyal, The One Real God (not the sadly perverted gospel of convenience you hear about in so many "churches" these days), and basically anything having to do with meat and melted cheese together in a steamy, mouth-watering au-pair.My wife has a much more "commercially successful" blog. Because I rarely post, and she frequently does, I've decided to stop crowding the internet with my use of valuable space here, and nest my bitter rants and biting sattire within her quaint and uplifting Wordpress site.
