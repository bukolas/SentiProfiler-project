This Blog is dedicated to all the Software professionals who are working day in and day out to make sure that they succeed in Professional life. Software Industry as is known to the outer world is far away from it. Those who are employer or are employed know the exact truth whereas the rest can only guess.

During the future posts, i will try my best to cover some of the aspects in form of my stories which are based on true "rumors". I will choose the name of the characters which may coincide with some of you. Day 1
"Would you be free this weekend?", Rihaan asked Suhani rather casually. She replied, "yes". This was the green signal that Rihaan was waiting for quite sometime.

Rihaan and Suhani met in office for the first time and there was something that clicked between them. They became close to each other in due course of time.

They started spending time with each other on weekends, since during weekdays it wasn't possible owing to strict professional conditions.   Day 2
Ravi and his Manager Karthik went into a meeting room. Ravi was told to move to Japan as an onshore coordinator for six months duration in the guise of learning opportunity.    Day 3
Mohan had a tough time convincing why he cannot relocate from Bangalore. Bimal, his Project Manager, was self proclaimed ruthless bastard.

He sarcastically made derogatory statements about Mohan and even stated in one of the Team meetings that "People should be flexible if they have to grow". But the most ugly statement which made everyone unhappy was "When one is asked for onsite assignments people jump on to it it's only when asked to relocate within India is when Father's have Heart Attack and Mothers have serious injuries!".

Everyone in the room cursed Bimal.    Day 4
The drama started with Bears & Sterns going bankrupt. No sooner most of the US financial companies started to believe that they will be hit and that too severely. Retrenchment plans were made in hurry and Pink slips started to arrive in hefty numbers.

Indian operations which were not on the radar for most of the time suddenly came into existence. One morning Lehman Brothers went Bankrupt! Sudheer, who was employed in the IT operations of LB at Mumbai, was shattered.

He went to office early that day.The day was Sept. 16, 2008    Day 5
Wasim gave his homely pleasures and moved to Bangalore in search of better professional life. Apart from cultural shock he was amazed at the lack of Infrastructure in the so called IT city of India. 

After spending a full fortnight he wasn't sure of the apartment which he wanted to live in. He wasn't accustomed to the whooping 10 months advance as a security theory! Moreover he didn't had that much of sum.

Not many people outside Karnataka knows that to take a rental accommodation in Bangalore the tenant has to pay a full 10 months advance as a security and the rent is high by any standards perhaps second higher after Mumbai.
