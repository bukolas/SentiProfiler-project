visit to school Having been invited(to light the inaugural candle) to the first alumni meet of my school(where I lived from std VI to XII) I eventually made up mind to visit my school(St Basil's School, Basti).Time has always been the biggest inventor of the things, and it did so.There wan't a wall that did not get metamorphed!Right from the Principal's room to the overlooked things such as toilets had changed-changed for the better.A new building had been raised adjcent to the existing main building; and it served as boys hostel.The playground had faded rudiments of the cricket pitch(that used to shine vibrantly in our age).The grass did eat the pitch up thereby announcing that the new generation is no more a fanatic of Cricket, and a good basketball courts speaks of the interest of this generation.

There stood a permanent open stage right at the spot where we used to make temporary ones at each festive occasions(be it a youth festival, sports day, annual functions...).In our time we used be the labelled labours[taking benches out to the grounds, making stage by tying them together and bringing them back to the respective classrooms in the same order!]The permanent stage is a good substitute but I feel it had killed something! ;the joy of escaping from the class legally and doing an odd job between those cranky gossips while sweating badly under the torrid sun!

I opened a classroom labelled "Std VII-A"(that infact used to be Std-XII 6 and a half years ago) and sat on the last but one bench of the middle row-my bench for it still bore my name that I carved with my 'divider(a geometry instrument)' on its right up corner.The handwriting is ofcourse bad when you try hard to represent yourself in the hard wood.A look at the black board made me remember of the faces that had taught me assortedly about this world.I could hear echoes of
Mr. James(our English Teacher) saying "To be or not to be is the question..." while he quoted intricacies of Hamlet's intellect,
Mr. Jaychandran(our teacher for Physics) saying "...the euations of magnetic fields are similar to those of electric fields except for...",
Mr. Jose explaining "...the methodology of ion detection tests have been based on the solubility product...", Mr. Sanjay while caressing his silky hairs "find out the correlation for this distribution and verify..." and so on and so forth.

Later I met with many of those faces; and I must admit that time did fail to change a few of them.Mrs Inan(our English Grammar teacher upto Class X) had exactly the same number of wrinkles she had seven years ago; Mr. Davis(our teacher for History upto Class X) was dressed in a shirt of same taste he had seven years ago;Who says you cannot travel back into the time!!

Then the friends, each of whom was already in some or the other flow of life(as decided by the individual destinies), with some antagoism disappeared while some mutual suspicion getting involuntarily introduced into the minds of the people who had seen each other after a long long break.
