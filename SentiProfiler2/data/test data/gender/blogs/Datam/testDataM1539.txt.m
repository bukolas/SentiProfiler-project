I was born in sathanur and bought in villupuram & chennai , I lived there for nearly quaterhalf my life before emigrating to the UK in 2010. Much of that time was spent at R.V.M.H.S School and SRM Valliamai Engg College; Originally an Electrical Engineer, I’ve spent most of my adult life working in that strange places where meets technology, for a number of very large firms. I’m passionate about the things that interest me. My family, My Lovely temple (Triuvanamalai) , community & My Friends( Subesh,Raghul) . A retarded hippie at heart, I listen primarily to music made in the rock,melodies,carnatic(whatever sound nice to me).. I’m passionate about my profession(s), both planned and accidental. More and more my interests have moved towards education, therefore in uk for my higher education M.Sc ( electronics and information technology)....
