Last Saturday we went to a so called Gypsy Fair, which was more market for weird stuff then actual fair. But the “house trucks” were interesting to look at. If you imagine an old gypsy wagon then transpose it onto an older style truck you kind of can imagine what they were like. But overall it was rather disappointing, as much is becoming here.  Like Greg’s aspirations for work. For weeks he diligently prepped his resume, reviewed immigration information and made profiles on various job search websites. But often when he went back to those websites he couldn’t use his log in information and so emailed the websites for assistance.
