Hi Jai, Paaru unna pathi ellam ezhutha vendiyatha iruku. "Romba amaithiyaana ponnunga iva" ippadi ellorum sollanumnu avalukku romba aasai athukaaga romba kashta pattu nadipaa. Romaba nalla padippa. I am Very proud to have a sister like her. Really admired and sometimes Jealous about her commitment. Ellorukkum AVA KANNU mela oru kannu. Ava photoku nalla pose kudupa, will soon upload those in orkut. As she wrote in my testimonial she is my main target for kidding. But many times I have saved her when others try to make fun of her. Umm I heard that she is a good singer and dancer but I am not fortunate to hear her voice or see her dancing still. Very good daughter to her parents. I have never seen her upset at anytime takes everything positively. Ippo romba nalla Whistle adikara. Padam paakum bothu thaan iva evvalavu suru surupa iruppaanu therium. BUBBLY JAI All the best for your future. May ur dream comes true. From ur everloving BROTHER :)
