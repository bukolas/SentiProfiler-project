I know I am on hiatus to a point but I had to share this!
I recently participated in a junk swap at Junk market Style. I received my package on Saturday from my delightful swap partner Avery. She is an art teacher who uses junk to make jewelry and assemblages. Perfect partner. I know you are completely jealous. Just look at this fabulous stash I received!!!

You wish you were me right now, no?

You really must not drool all over your keyboard.

I knew this one would get you! Fantastic piles of yummy junk.

What more is there to say?

She even took into consideration my fascination with everything pertaining to the Sacraments.

Now I need to put my thinking cap on and start creating. Avery, you are the best! You need to start a blog and show us all the creative things you do with the junk you find.
Once again I was lame and forgot to take pics before I sent my box out.  Hope she enjoys what I sent as much as I am enjoying her selection. (Sadie and I keep going through it all as if it was a treasure chest filled with diamonds.) To us it is!

Have a treasure of a day, P.

BTW I temporarily added the eggs to the wooden piece Avery sent. I am loving that piece! It may become my permanent centerpiece to play with through the seasons!
