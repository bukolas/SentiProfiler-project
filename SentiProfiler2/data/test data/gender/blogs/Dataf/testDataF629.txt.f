this is the house of my great-grandparents and the place where my grandmother was born. My family moved already before I was born and for a while nobody lived there. Later my parents spent some weekends with friends over there. my parents in 1967 Then the house was sold, but from time to time we came back together with my grandparents. I remember my grandmother standing in front of the house and telling stories from the past. Although the place changed over the years, she still felt a deep connection, not only to the house and ground, but I think to her family´s past - that´s what she called HOME. Feeling some kind of "unsettledness" inside myself, I lately think a lot about what HOME is. I´d like to know where or what do you call HOME? found these funny vintage hotel bathroom papers from the sixties still rests of snow on the rooftops... and I feel soooo tired these days and so do my 2 cats. One of them is snoring REALLY loud, while I´m typing this flowers found at my studio doorsteps :) Lovely vintage sewing patterns I woke up early today and shot some pics of the snow covered garden, wandered through the house with the camera in one hand and the coffee cup in the other one, taking pics of some corners: this the place where the art of Picasso meets the art of Graca Paz and others - the guest restroom. For a psychedelic dose just take a deep look to the tiles [more effective in real life] Decomyplace the stamps came today and now I´m packing.... I needed some small cards for give away by occasion and also to add to the small packages, where no postcard format fits in. Both sides can be printed in color. I think they are really cute and I like the little card boxes they are coming in. Ordered online here Sometimes my customers are sending me pics from my "babies" in their new homes, this one makes me especially blissful Grüffalo, alias Arni Twillson was taken to the carneval party in the kindergarden by 4 year old Henry...
