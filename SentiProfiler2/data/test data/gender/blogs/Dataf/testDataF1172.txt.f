I am always pushing for the reduction of the stigma surrounding mental illness. It may be my error to think that we have made progress. What I infer from this article is that universities have regressed when it comes to social acceptance of mental illness. This is something that began prior to the horrifying Virgina Tech massacre. Read the article to learn the extremes that are being taken against those that are mentally ill. With statistics like one in four Americans diagnosed with a mental illness, the number requires more mental health support. There are too many people that are not seeking the help they need. The response to the health problem the universities are making for anyone, let alone a huge number of the population, are insufficient. There is a quote in this article from a politician, Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston who is open about his mental illness. I can only hope those voices in important places like his, and those of the entertainment industry like Patty Duke and Carrie Fisher, will continue to speak and unveil the misconceptions. I can only hope.
