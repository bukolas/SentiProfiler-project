Don't know why I am writing this.. but I feel like writing this...why is that everytime i read a post here, i am relating it with a page in my life? why is that every time, i m reminded of my dad or mom when i read anything out here.. reason- all of us- we go through same phases in life.. emotions are the same! 
bt the bizziare thing abt this post is tht- i have never had much friends too.. i was, guess all the time, in my own world.. at school- nt many kids used to talk to me- coz i always used to in these music or drama kind of activities.. for some reason other kids found tht to be some kind of strange thing.. i was an alien species among the "mark/grade hungry" crowd... it became the opposite while at college! so, i have never had much people whom i could call friends..
