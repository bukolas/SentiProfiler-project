everytime i look at those pictures, everytime i hear the name, everytime it just crosses my mind. i feel like i’m going crazy, all these thoughts bouncing from edge to edge in my mind. always there, but at least sometimes they’re skirting around the edges instead of blaring straight into my thoughts.

my heart drops straight into my stomach, same feeling every time. almost like how it feels when i take my pill.. but it’s like. the bad version of it. the version that causes me anxiety instead of getting rid of it.

my thoughts are one giant cluster fuck, i’m sick of this thing every body else calls life.

i sleep whenever i can, because my constant night terrors are better than dealing the cold hard truth that is reality. i can’t handle this, and that’s all i know.

“Its a bad night to be alone, but thats the way it goes.”

i hate the feeling when you're full on sleep, too the point where all you want is to just sleep, but your mind is going through the awful thing that is thinking. nothing else sounds slightly okay. sleep is the escape from a bitter reality.
