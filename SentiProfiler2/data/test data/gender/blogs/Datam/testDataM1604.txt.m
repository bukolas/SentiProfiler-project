You hear many vhristians claiming that their god is the absence of evil.  They usually start their conversation with things like "dark is the absence of light" and "heat is the absence of cold".  There is even the hoax letter that has been going around for years now about the student who supposedly one up's his mean evil atheist professor, using the very things said above.  In some versions it is said that Einstein did it, either way not only is it a fake and one of the worst christian arguments, it also provides one of the best counter arguments against such a god. 

     I go over this in the form of a reductio ad absurdum in a previous blog, "A Different Look at the Problem of Evil", but lets form it into a direct argument against the god presented above.
1) God is pure good, the absence of evil. (Matthew 19:17).
2) If god is the absence of evil, then evil exists only where god is not. 
3) God is omnipresent, he is everywhere.(Psalm 139:8, Jeremiah 23:23,24)
4) Evil exists. 
5) Therefore God does not exist
So, either:
1. God does not exist
or 
2. God is not the absence of evil
or 
3. God is not omnipresent
