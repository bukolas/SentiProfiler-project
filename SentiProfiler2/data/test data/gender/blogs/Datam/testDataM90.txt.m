The Trauma of Restlessness.... Its 1 am midnight and nothing to do. I just lost my mobile as it is took by examination wing, bloody Airtel, they sent me the message in middle of the exam and it wasnt in silent mode :(
Anyhow, just few days back i finished my examinations and as usual i m not sure i will pass all of them.
Now i want to discuss few patterns which i observed while preparing and writing the exams and i find them very critical and we must discuss them.
1. The first thing of all is about Cricket. Last year when we play cricket we use to practise on the main ground instead of going behind sps or somewhere else. Now we all can imagine the rush on the ground and the chaos after 5pm. The thing which needs notice is that the form of all the batsmen of Team gets affected. They scored runs but were not in the touch they used to be in.

2. I also noticed that in a home the kid who got scolded for studies always performs inferior than his sibling who is not scolded. Now dont say that one who didnt study had to face the nagging and its usual. Lets make it more clear. The one who is naughty or say full of energy is first gets the praise of parents and neighbours for his cleverness, but later age of around 8-10 years his naughtiness increases and the parents start scolding him for o a thing or two and then for everything. Also the cleverness he showed(assumed by his parents) is not visible in his studies and the one who is less clever got the same grades or better. And then comes the most common and used phrase "My this child is intelligent but i dont know why he dont study". And its really very good fortune of parents if that clever child shows better performance in his remaining life, because very few did it.

3.This time while writing exams, the only thing which comes to my mind is football. Intermilan, Barcelona, Chelsea and all that. When exam gets over, these things also goes out of my mind.

Now what is the thing linking above three paragraphs ?

Now let me explain you the cases one by one.
First in Cricket there is a term called "Comfort Zone" in batting. Thats why a out of form batsman is adviced to use nets rather than playing more matches to retain his "Comfort Zone".
1st story of my cricket team is that all the batsmen while playing in the chaos lost their comfort zone and lost the touch. 3rd story is about for last 1 month i downloaded nearly 50gb of football and kept watching that in every free time. Now while studies the thing which runs in my mind is football. The brain got a speciality to emulate the conditions you keep it in. and while exams i gave my brain few conditions like pen and paper and it emulate the thought process i use to be in while pen and paper and thats thinking about football.
Now the 2nd and most saddening story.... Everyone catches habit of the thing we repeatedly do. Parents also gets into the habit of scolding their child and which they do, considering it a very small matter. Now a child after nagging when sits to study, cannot achieve a thing which we call is "Comfort Zone". The thing runs to his mind is restlessness, his ego and his brains immediately in a year or two comes into the habit of "No Comfort Zone". This is also trmed as a disease "ADHD" or simply "ADD". And whenever a child sits down to study his brain didnt let him to do so by coming to "NO Comfort Zone". And it could be seen in our socity that usually elder brother is relatively better in studies than younger, becuse the younger one got more energy and of course as he emulates his elder brother, his acts seems to be more clever according to his age, but his cleverness is not at all visible in his grades. And everyone scolds him for not spending enough time in studies. There starts his training of loosing the habit of concentration. The comfort zone is the thing which is so important that you can crack an exam if you retain it and could underperform if you cant. The preperation is not the only thing which matters.
