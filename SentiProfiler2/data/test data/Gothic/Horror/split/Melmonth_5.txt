e not find in them, an answer to those questions with which we are for ever importuning the mute oracle of our destiny?–Alas! how deceitful and inadequate we feel the language of man, after love and grief have made us acquainted with that of nature!–the only one, perhaps, capable of a corresponding sign for those emotions, under which all human expression faints. What a difference between words without meaning, and that meaning without words, which the sublime phenomena of nature, the rocks and the ocean, the moon and the twilight, convey to those who have 'ears to hear.'

'How eloquent of truth is nature in her very silence! How fertile of reflections amid her profoundest desolations! But the desolation now presented to the eyes of Immalee, was that which is calculated to cause terror, not reflection. Earth and heaven, the sea and the dry land, seemed mingling together, and about to replunge into chaos. The ocean, deserting its eternal bed, dashed its waves, whose white surf gleamed through the darkness, far into the shores of the isle. They came on like the crests of a thousand warriors, plumed and tossing in their pride, and, like them, perishing in the moment of victory. There was a fearful inversion of the natural appearance of earth and sea, as if all the barriers of nature were broken, and all her laws reversed.

'The waves deserting their station, left, from time to time, the sands as dry as those of the desert; and the trees and shrubs tossed and heaved in ceaseless agitation, like the waves of a midnight storm. There was no light, but a livid grey that sickened the eye to behold, except when the bright red lightning burst out like the eye of a fiend, glancing over the work of ruin, and closing as it beheld it completed.

'Amid this scene stood two beings, one whose appealing loveliness seemed to have found favour with the elements even in their wrath, and one whose fearless and obdurate eye appeared to defy them. 'Immalee,' he cried, 'is this a place or an hour to talk of love!–all nature is appalled–heaven is dark–the animals have hid themselves–and the very shrubs, as they wave and shrink, seem alive with terror.'–'It is an hour to implore protection,' said the Indian, clinging to him timidly. 'Look up,' said the stranger, while his own fixed and fearless eye seemed to return flash for flash to the baffled and insulted elements; 'Look up, and if you cannot resist the impulses of your heart, let me at least point out a fitter object for them. Love,' he cried, extending his arm towards the dim and troubled sky, 'love the storm in its might of destruction–seek alliance with those swift and perilous travellers of the groaning air,–the meteor that rends, and the thunder that shakes it! Court, for sheltering tenderness, those masses of dense and rolling cloud,–the baseless mountains of heaven! Woo the kisses of the fiery lightnings, to quench themselves on your smouldering bosom! Seek all that is terrible in nature for your companions and your lover!–woo them to burn and blast you–perish in their fierce embrace, and you will be happier, far happier, than if you lived in mine! Lived!–Oh who can be mine and live! Hear me, Immalee!' he cried, while he held her hands locked in his–while his eyes, rivetted on her, sent forth a light of intolerable lustre–while a new feeling of indefinite enthusiasm seemed for a moment to thrill his whole frame, and new-modulate the tone of his nature; 'Hear me! If you will be mine, it must be amid a scene like this for ever–amid fire and darkness–amid hatred and despair–amid–' and his voice swelling to a demoniac shriek of rage and horror, and his arms extended, as if to grapple with the fearful objects of some imaginary struggle, he was rushing from the arch under which they stood, lost in the picture which his guilt and despair had drawn, and whose images he was for ever doomed to behold.

'The slender form that had clung to him was, by this sudden movement, prostrated at his feet; and, with a voice choaked with terror, yet with that perfect devotedness which never issued but from the heart and lip of woman, she answered his frightful questions with the simple demand, 'Will you be there?–'Yes!–THERE I must be, and for ever! And will you, and dare you, be with me?' And a kind of wild and terrible energy nerved his frame, and strengthened his voice, as he spoke and cowered over pale and prostrate loveliness, that seemed in profound and reckless humiliation to court its own destruction, as if a dove exposed its breast, without flight or struggle, to the beak of a vulture. 'Well, then,' said the stranger, while a brief convulsion crossed his pale visage, 'amid thunder I wed thee–bride of perdition! mine shalt thou be for ever! Come, and let us attest our nuptials before the reeling altar of nature, with the lightnings of heaven for our bed-lights, and the curse of nature for our marriage-benediction!' The Indian shrieked in terror, not at his words, which she did not understand, but at the expression which accompanied them. 'Come,' he repeated, 'while the darkness yet is witness to our ineffable and eternal union.' Immalee, pale, terrified, but resolute, retreated from him.

'At this moment the storm, which had obscured the heavens and ravaged the earth, passed away with the rapidity common in those climates, where the visitation of an hour does its work of destruction unimpeded, and is instantly succeeded by the smiling lights and brilliant skies of which mortal curiosity in vain asks the question, Whether they gleam in triumph or in consolation over the mischief they witness?

'As the stranger spoke, the clouds passed away, carrying their diminished burden of wrath and terror where sufferings were to be inflicted, and terrors to be undergone, by the natives of other climes–and the bright moon burst forth with a glory unknown in European climes. The heavens were as blue as the waves of the ocean, which they seemed to reflect; and the stars burst forth with a kind of indignant and aggravated brilliancy, as if they resented the usurpation of the storm, and asserted the eternal predominance of nature over the casual influences of the storms that obscured her. Such, perhaps, will be the developement of the moral world. We shall be told why we suffered, and for what; but a bright and blessed lustre shall follow the storm, and all shall yet be light.

'The young Indian caught from this object an omen alike auspicious to her imagination and her heart. She burst from him–she rushed into the light of nature, whose glory seemed like the promise of redemption, gleaming amid the darkness of the fall. She pointed to the moon, that sun of the eastern nights, whose broad and brilliant light fell like a mantle of glory over rock and ruin, over tree and flower.

'Wed me by this light,' cried Immalee, 'and I will be yours for ever!' And her beautiful countenance reflected the full light of the glorious planet that rode bright through the cloudless heaven–and her white and naked arms, extended towards it, seemed like two pure attesting pledges of the union. 'Wed me by this light,' she repeated, sinking on her knees, 'and I will be yours for ever!'

'As she spoke, the stranger approached, moved with what feelings no mortal thought can discover. At that moment a trifling phenomenon interfered to alter her destiny. A darkened cloud at that moment covered the moon–it seemed as if the departed storm collected in wrathful haste the last dark fold of its tremendous drapery, and was about to pass away for ever.

'The eyes of the stranger flashed on Immalee the brightest rays of mingled fondness and ferocity. He pointed to the darkness,–'WED ME BY THIS LIGHT!' he exclaimed, 'and you shall be mine for ever and ever!' Immalee, shuddering at the grasp in which he held her, and trying in vain to watch the expression of his countenance, yet felt enough of her danger to tear herself from him. 'Farewell for ever!' exclaimed the stranger, as he rushed from her.

'Immalee, exhausted by emotion and terror, had fallen senseless on the sands that filled the path to the ruined pagoda. He returned–he raised her in his arms–her long dark hair streamed over them like the drooping banners of a defeated army–her arms sunk down as if declining the support they seemed to implore–her cold and colourless cheek rested on his shoulder.

'Is she dead?' he murmured. 'Well, be it so–let her perish–let her be any thing but mine!' He flung his senseless burden on the sands, and departed–nor did he ever revisit the island.'

MAGDALÈNIADE, by Father Pierre de St Louis.


'Three years had elapsed since the parting of Immalee and the stranger, when one evening the attention of some Spanish gentlemen, who were walking in a public place in Madrid, was arrested by a figure that passed them, habited in the dress of the country, (only without a sword), and walking very slowly. They stopt by a kind of simultaneous movement, and seemed to ask each other, with silent looks, what had been the cause of the impression this person's appearance had made on them. There was nothing remarkable in his figure,–his demeanour was quiet; it was the singular expression of his countenance which had struck them with a sensation they could neither define or account for.

'As they paused, the person returned alone, and walking slowly–and they again encountered that singular expression of the features, (the eyes particularly), which no human glance could meet unappalled. Accustomed to look on and converse with all things revolting to nature and to man,–for ever exploring the mad-house, the jail, or the Inquisition,–the den of famine, the dungeon of crime, or the death-bed of despair,–his eyes had acquired a light and a language of their own–a light that none could gaze on, and a language that few dare understand.

'As he passed slowly by them, they observed two others whose attention was apparently fixed on the same singular object, for they stood pointing after him, and speaking to each other with gestures of strong and obvious emotion. The curiosity of the groupe for once overcame the restraint of Spanish reserve, and approaching the two cavaliers, they inquired if the singular personage who had passed was not the subject of their conversation, and the cause of the emotion which appeared to accompany it. The others replied in the affirmative, and hinted at their knowledge of circumstances in the character and history of that extraordinary being that might justify even stronger marks of emotion at his presence. This hint operated still more strongly on their curiosity–the circle of listeners began to deepen. Some of them, it appeared, had, or pretended to have, some information relative to this extraordinary subject. And that kind of desultory conversation commenced, whose principal ingredients are a plentiful proportion of ignorance, curiosity, and fear, mingled with some small allowance of information and truth;–that conversation, vague, unsatisfactory, but not uninteresting, to which every speaker is welcome to contribute his share of baseless report,–wild conjecture,–anecdote the more incredible the better credited,–and conclusion the more falsely drawn the more likely to carry home conviction.

'The conversation passed very much in language incoherent as this:–'But why, if he be what he is described, what he is known to be,–why is he not seized by order of government?–why is he not immured in the Inquisition?'–'He has been often in the prison of the holy office–oftener, perhaps, than the holy fathers wished,' said another. 'But it is a well-known fact, that whatever transpired on his examination, he was liberated almost immediately.' Another added, 'That the stranger had been in almost every prison in Europe, but had always contrived either to defeat or defy the power in whose grasp he appeared to be inclosed,–and to be active in his purposes of mischief in the remotest parts of Europe at the moment he was supposed to be expiating them in others.' Another demanded, 'If it was known to what country he belonged?' and was answered, 'He is said to be a native of Ireland–(a country that no one knows, and which the natives are particularly reluctant to dwell in from various causes)–and his name is Melmoth.' The Spaniard had great difficulty in expressing the theta, unpronounceable by continental lips. Another, who had an appearance of more intelligence than the rest, added the extraordinary fact of the stranger's being seen in various and distant parts of the earth within a time in which no power merely human could be supposed to traverse them–that his marked and fearful habit was every where to seek out the most wretched, or the most profligate, of the community among which he flung himself–what was his object in seeking them was unknown.'–'It is well known,' said a deep-toned voice, falling on the ears of the startled listeners like the toll of a strong but muffled bell,–'it is well known both to him and them.'

'It was now twilight, but the eyes of all could distinguish the figure of the stranger as he passed; and some even averred they could see the ominous lustre of those eyes which never rose on human destiny but as planets of woe. The groupe paused for some time to watch the retreat of the figure that had produced on them the effect of the torpedo. It departed slowly,–no one offered it molestation.

'I have heard,' said one of the company, 'that a delicious music precedes the approach of this person when his destined victim,–the being whom he is permitted to tempt or to torture,–is about to appear or to approach him. I have heard a strange tale of such music being heard; and–Holy Mary be our guide! did you ever hear such sounds?'–'Where–what?–' and the astonished listeners took off their hats, unclasped their mantles, opened their lips, and drew in their breath, in delicious ecstasy at the sounds that floated round them. 'No wonder,' said a young gallant of the party, 'no wonder that such sounds harbinger the approach of a being so heavenly. She deals with the good spirits; and the blessed saints alone could send such music from above to welcome her.' As he spoke, all eyes were turned to a figure, which, though moving among a groupe of brilliant and attractive females, appeared the only one among them on whom the eye could rest with pure and undivided light and love. She did not catch observation–observation caught her, and was proud of its prize.

'At the approach of a large party of females, there was all that anxious and flattering preparation among the cavaliers,–all that eager arrangement of capas, and hats, and plumes,–that characterized the manners of a nation still half-feudal, and always gallant and chivalrous. These preliminary movements were answered by corresponding ones on the part of the fair and fatal host approaching. The creaking of their large fans–the tremulous and purposely-delayed adjustment of their floating veils, whose partial concealment flattered the imagination beyond the most full and ostentatious disclosure of the charms they seemed jealous of–the folds of the mantilla, of whose graceful falls, and complicated manoeuvres, and coquettish undulations, the Spanish women know how to avail themselves so well–all these announced an attack, which the cavaliers, according to the modes of gallantry in that day (1683), were well prepared to meet and parry.

'But, amid the bright host that advanced against them, there was one whose arms were not artificial, and the effect of whose singular and simple attractions made a strong contrast to the studied arrangements of her associates. If her fan moved, it was only to collect air–if she arranged her veil, it was only to hide her face–if she adjusted her mantilla, it was but to hide that form, whose exquisite symmetry defied the voluminous drapery of even that day to conceal it. Men of the loosest gallantry fell back as she approached, with involuntary awe–the libertine who looked on her was half-converted–the susceptible beheld her as one who realized that vision of imagination that must never be embodied here–and the unfortunate as one whose sight alone was consolation–the old, as they gazed on her, dreamt of their youth–and the young for the first time dreamt of love–the only love which deserves the name–that which purity alone can inspire, and perfect purity alone can reward.

'As she mingled among the gay groupes that filled the place, one might observe a certain air that distinguished her from every female there,–not by pretension to superiority, (of that her unequalled loveliness must have acquitted her, even to the vainest of the groupe), but by an untainted, unsophisticated character, diffusing itself over look and motion, and even thought–turning wildness into grace–giving an emphasis to a single exclamation, that made polished sentences sound trifling–for ever trespassing against etiquette with vivid and fearless enthusiasm, and apologizing the next moment with such timid and graceful repentance, that one doubted whether the offence or the apology were most delightful.

'She presented altogether a singular contrast to the measured tones, the mincing gait, and the organized uniformity of dress, and manner, and look, and feeling, of the females about her. The harness of art was upon every limb and feature from their birth, and its trappings concealed or crippled every movement which nature had designed for graceful. But in the movement of this young female, there was a bounding elasticity, a springiness, a luxuriant and conscious vitality, that made every action the expression of thought; and then, as she shrunk from the disclosure, made it the more exquisite interpreter of feeling. There was around her a mingled light of innocence and majesty, never united but in her sex. Men may long retain, and even confirm, the character of power which nature has stamped on their frames, but they very soon forfeit their claim to the expression of innocence.

'Amid the vivid and eccentric graces of a form that seemed like a comet in the world of beauty, bound by no laws, or by laws that she alone understood and obeyed, there was a shade of melancholy, that, to a superficial observer, seemed transitory and assumed, perhaps as a studied relief to the glowing colours of a picture so brilliant, but which, to other eyes, announced, that with all the energies of intellect occupied,–with all the instincts of sense excited,–the heart had as yet no inmate, and wanted one.

'The groupe who had been conversing about the stranger, felt their attention irresistibly attracted by this object; and the low murmur of their fearful whispers was converted into broken exclamations of delight and wonder, as the fair vision passed them. She had not long done so, when the stranger was seen slowly returning, seeming, as before, known to all, but knowing none. As the female party turned, they encountered him. His emphatic glance selected and centred in one alone. She saw him too, recognized him, and, uttering a wild shriek, fell on the earth senseless.

'The tumult occasioned by this accident, which so many witnessed, and none knew the cause of, for some moments drew off the attention of all from the stranger–all were occupied either in assisting or inquiring after the lady who had fainted. She was borne to her carriage by more assistants than she needed or wished for–and just as she was lifted into it, the voice of some one near her uttered the word 'Immalee!' She recognized the voice, and turned, with a look of anguish and a feeble cry, towards the direction from which it proceeded. Those around her had heard the sound,–but as they did not understand its meaning, or know to whom it was addressed, they ascribed the lady's emotion to indisposition, and hastened to place her in her carriage. It drove away, but the stranger pursued its course with his eyes–the company dispersed, he remained alone–twilight faded into darkness–he appeared not to notice the change–a few still continued lingering at the extremity of the walk to mark him–they were wholly unmarked by him.

'One who remained the longest said, that he saw him use the action of one who wipes away a tear hastily. To his eyes the tear of penitence was denied for ever. Could this have been the tear of passion? If so, how much woe did it announce to its object!'





CHAPTER XX



Oh what was love made for, if 'tis not the same
Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame!
I know not, I ask not, what guilt's in thine heart,
I but know I must love thee, whatever thou art.
 
MOORE


'The next day, the young female who had excited so much interest the preceding evening, was to quit Madrid, to pass a few weeks at a villa belonging to her family, at a short distance from the city. That family, including all the company, consisted of her mother Donna Clara di Aliaga, the wife of a wealthy merchant, who was monthly expected to return from the Indies; her brother Don Fernan di Aliaga, and several servants; for these wealthy citizens, conscious of their opulence and formerly high descent, piqued themselves upon travelling with no less ceremony and pompous tardiness than accompanied the progress of a grandee. So the old square-built, lumbering carriage, moved on like a hearse; the coachman sat fast asleep on the box; and the six black horses crawled at a pace like the progress of time when he visits affliction. Beside the carriage rode Fernan di Aliaga and his servants, with umbrellas and huge spectacles; and within it were placed Donna Clara and her daughter. The interior of this arrangement was the counterpart of its external appearance,–all announced dullness, formality, and withering monotony.

'Donna Clara was a woman of a cold and grave temper, with all the solemnity of a Spaniard, and all the austerity of a bigot. Don Fernan presented that union of fiery passion and saturnic manners not unusual among Spaniards. His dull and selfish pride was wounded by the recollection of his family having been in trade; and, looking on the unrivalled beauty of his sister as a possible means of his obtaining an alliance with a family of rank, he viewed her with that kind of selfish partiality as little honourable to him who feels it, as to her who was its object.

'And it was amid such beings that the vivid and susceptible Immalee, the daughter of nature, 'the gay creature of the elements,' was doomed to wither away the richly-coloured and exquisitely-scented flower of an existence so ungenially transplanted. Her singular destiny seemed to have removed her from a physical wilderness, to place her in a moral one. And, perhaps, her last state was worse than her first.

'It is certain that the gloomiest prospect presents nothing so chilling as the aspect of human faces, in which we try in vain to trace one corresponding expression; and the sterility of nature itself is luxury compared to the sterility of human hearts, which communicate all the desolation they feel.

'They had been some time on their way, when Donna Clara, who never spoke till after a long preface of silence, perhaps to give what she said a weight it might otherwise have wanted, said, with oracular deliberation, 'Daughter, I hear you fainted in the public walks last night–did you meet with any thing that surprised or terrified you?'–'No, Madam,'–'What, then, could be the cause of the emotion you betrayed at the sight, as I am told–I know nothing–of a personage of extraordinary demeanour?'–'Oh, I cannot, dare not tell!' said Isidora, dropping her veil over her burning cheek. Then the irrepressible ingenuousness of her former nature, rushing over her heart and frame like a flood, she sunk from the cushion on which she sat at Donna Clara's feet, exclaiming, 'Oh, mother, I will tell you all!'–'No!' said Donna Clara, repelling her with a cold feeling of offended pride; 'no!–there is no occasion. I seek no confidence withheld and bestowed in the same breath; nor do I like these violent emotions–they are unmaidenly. Your duties as a child are easily understood–they are merely perfect obedience, profound submission, and unbroken silence, except when you are addressed by me, your brother, or Father Jose. Surely no duties were ever more easily performed–rise, then, and cease to weep. If your conscience disturbs you, accuse yourself to Father Jose, who will, no doubt, inflict a penance proportioned to the enormity of your offence. I trust only he will not err on the side of indulgence.' And so saying, Donna Clara, who had never uttered so long a speech before, reclined back on her cushion, and began to tell her beads with much devotion, till the arrival of the carriage at its destination awoke her from a profound and peaceful sleep.

'It was near noon, and dinner in a cool low apartment near the garden awaited only the approach of Father Jose, the confessor. He arrived at length. He was a man of an imposing figure, mounted on a stately mule. His features, at first view, bore strong traces of thought; but, on closer examination, those traces seemed rather the result of physical conformation, than of any intellectual exercise. The channel was open, but the stream had not been directed there. However, though defective in education, and somewhat narrow in mind, Father Jose was a good man, and meant well. He loved power, and he was devoted to the interests of the Catholic church; but he had frequently doubts, (which he kept to himself), of the absolute necessity of celibacy, and he felt (strange effect!) a chill all over him when he heard of the fires of an auto da fe. Dinner was concluded; the fruit and wine, the latter untasted by the females, were on the table,–the choicest of them placed before Father Jose,–when Isidora, after a profound reverence to her mother and the priest, retired, as usual, to her apartment. Donna Clara turned to the confessor with a look that demanded to be answered. 'It is her hour for siesta,' said the priest, helping himself to a bunch of grapes. 'No, Father, no!' said Donna Clara sadly; 'her maid informs me she does not retire to sleep. She was, alas! too well accustomed to that burning climate where she was lost in her infancy, to feel the heat as a Christian should. No, she retires neither to pray or sleep, after the devout custom of Spanish women, but, I fear, to'–-'To do what?' said the priest, with horror in his voice–'To think, I fear,' said Donna Clara; 'for often I observe, on her return, the traces of tears on her face. I tremble, Father, lest those tears be shed for that heathen land, that region of Satan, where her youth was past.'–'I'll give her a penance,' said Father Jose, 'that will save her the trouble of shedding tears on the score of memory at least–these grapes are delicious.'–'But, Father,' pursued Donna Clara, with all the weak but restless anxiety of a superstitious mind, 'though you have made me easy on that subject, I still am wretched. Oh, Father, how she will talk sometimes!–like a creature self-taught, that needed neither director or confessor but her own heart.'–'How!' exclaimed Father Jose, 'need neither confessor or director!–she must be beside herself.'–'Oh, Father,' continued Donna Clara, 'she will say things in her mild and unanswerable manner, that, armed with all my authority, I'–'How–how is that?' said the priest, in a tone of severity–'does she deny any of the tenets of the holy Catholic church?'–'No! no! no!' said the terrified Donna Clara crossing herself. 'How then?'–'Why, she speaks in a manner in which I never heard you, reverend Father, or any of the reverend brethren, whom my devotion to the holy church has led me to hear, speak before. It is in vain I tell her that true religion consists in hearing mass–in going to confession–in performing penance–in observing the fasts and vigils–in undergoing mortification and abstinence–in believing all that the holy church teaches–and hating, detesting, abhorring, and execrating–' 'Enough, daughter–enough,' said Father Jose; 'there can be no doubt of the orthodoxy of your creed?'–'I trust not, holy Father,' said the anxious Donna Clara. 'I were an infidel to doubt it,' interposed the priest; 'I might as well deny this fruit to be exquisite, or this glass of Malaga to be worthy the table of his Holiness the Pope, if he feasted all the Cardinals. But how, daughter, as touching the supposed or apprehended defalcations in Donna Isidora's creed?'–'Holy Father, I have already explained my own religious sentiments.'–'Yes–yes–we have had enough of them; now for your daughter's.'–'She will sometimes say,' said Donna Clara, bursting into tears–'she will say, but never till greatly urged, that religion ought to be a system whose spirit was universal love. Do you understand any thing of that, Father?' 'Humph–humph!'–'That it must be something that bound all who professed it to habits of benevolence, gentleness, and humility, under every difference of creed and of form.'–'Humph–humph!'–'Father,' said Donna Clara, a little piqued at the apparent indifference with which Father Jose listened to her communications, and resolved to rouse him by some terrific evidence of the truth of her suspicions, 'Father, I have heard her dare to express a hope that the heretics in the train of the English ambassador might not be everlastingly'–'Hush!–I must not hear such sounds, or it might be my duty to take severer notice of these lapses. However, daughter,' continued Father Jose, 'thus far I will venture for your consolation. As sure as this fine peach is in my hand–another, if you please–and as sure as I shall finish this other glass of Malaga'–here a long pause attested the fulfilment of the pledge–'so sure'–and Father Jose turned the inverted glass on the table–'Madonna Isidora has–has the elements of a Christian in her, however improbable it may seem to you–I swear it to you by the habit I wear;–for the rest, a little penance–a–I shall consider of it. And now, daughter, when your son Don Fernan has finished his siesta,–as there is no reason to suspect him of retiring to think,–please to inform him I am ready to continue the game of chess which we commenced four months ago. I have pushed my pawn to the last square but one, and the next step gives me a queen.'–'Has the game continued so long?' said Donna Clara. 'Long!' repeated the priest, 'Aye, and may continue much longer–we have never played more than three hours a-day on an average.'

'He then retired to sleep, and the evening was passed by the priest and Don Fernan, in profound silence at their chess–by Donna Clara, in silence equally profound, at her tapestry–and by Isidora at the casement, which the intolerable heat had compelled them to leave open, in gazing at the lustre of the moon, and inhaling the odour of the tube-rose, and watching the expanding leaves of the night-blowing cereus. The physical luxuries of her former existence seemed renewed by these objects. The intense blue of the heavens, and the burning planet that stood in sole glory in their centre, might have vied with all that lavish and refulgent opulence of light in which nature arrays an Indian night. Below, too, there were flowers and fragrance; colours, like veiled beauty, mellowed, not hid; and dews that hung on every leaf, trembling and sparkling like the tears of spirits, that wept to take leave of the flowers.

'The breeze, indeed, though redolent of the breath of the orange blossom, the jasmine, and the rose, had not the rich and balmy odour that scents the Indian air by night.







'Except this, what was not there that might not renew the delicious dream of her former existence, and make her believe herself again the queen of that fairy isle?–One image was wanting–an image whose absence made that paradise of islands, and all the odorous and flowery luxury of a moonlight garden in Spain, alike deserts to her. In her heart alone could she hope to meet that image,–to herself alone did she dare to repeat his name, and those wild and sweet songs of his country1 which he had taught her in his happier moods. And so strange was the contrast between her former and present existence,–so subdued was she by constraint and coldness,–so often had she been told that every thing she did, said, or thought, was wrong,–that she began to yield up the evidences of her senses, to avoid the perpetual persecutions of teazing and imperious mediocrity, and considered the appearance of the stranger as one of those visions that formed the trouble and joy of her dreamy and illusive existence.



1 Ireland.



'I am surprised, sister,' said Fernan, whom Father Jose's gaining his queen had put in unusually bad humour–'I am surprised that you never busy yourself, as young maidens use, at your needle, or in some quaint niceties of your sex.'–'Or in reading some devout book,' said Donna Clara, raising her eyes one moment from her tapestry, and then dropping them again; 'there is the legend of that Polish saint,1 born, like her, in a land of darkness, yet chosen to be a vessel–I have forgot his name, reverend Father.'–'Check to the king,' said Father Jose in reply. 'You regard nothing but watching a few flowers, or hanging over your lute, or gazing at the moon,' continued Fernan, vexed alike at the success of his antagonist and the silence of Isidora. 'She is eminent in alms-deeds and works of charity,' said the good-natured priest. 'I was summoned to a miserable hovel near your villa, Madonna Clara, to a dying sinner, a beggar rotting on rotten straw!'–'Jesu!' cried Donna Clara with involuntary horror, 'I washed the feet of thirteen beggars, on my knees in my father's hall, the week before my marriage with her honoured father, and I never could abide the sight of a beggar since.'–'Associations are sometimes indelibly strong,' said the priest drily;–then he added, 'I went as was my duty, but your daughter was there before me. She had gone uncalled, and was uttering the sweetest words of consolation from a homily, which a certain poor priest, who shall be nameless, had lent her from his humble store.'



1 I have read the legend of this Polish saint, which is circulated in Dublin, and find recorded among the indisputable proofs of his vocation, that he infallibly swooned if an indecent expression was uttered in his presence–when in his nurse's arms!



'Isidora blushed at this anonymous vanity, while she mildly smiled or wept at the harassings of Don Fernan, and the heartless austerity of her mother. 'I heard her as I entered the hovel; and, by the habit I wear, I paused on the threshold with delight. Her first words were–Check-mate!' he exclaimed, forgetting his homily in his triumph, and pointing, with appealing eye, and emphatic finger, to the desperate state of his adversary's king. 'That was a very extraordinary exclamation!' said the literal Donna Clara, who had never raised her eyes from her work.–'I did not think my daughter was so fond of chess as to burst into the house of a dying beggar with such a phrase in her mouth.'–'It was I said it, Madonna,' said the priest, reverting to his game, on which he hung with soul and eye intent on his recent victory. 'Holy saints!' said Donna Clara, still more and more perplexed, 'I thought the usual phrase on such occasions was pax vobiscum, or'–Before Father Jose could reply, a shriek from Isidora pierced the ears of every one. All gathered round her in a moment, reinforced by four female attendants and two pages, whom the unusual sound had summoned from the antichamber. Isidora had not fainted; she still stood among them pale as death, speechless, her eye wandering round the groupe that encircled her, without seeming to distinguish them. But she retained that presence of mind which never deserts woman where a secret is to be guarded, and she neither pointed with finger, or glanced with eye, towards the casement, where the cause of her alarm had presented itself. Pressed with a thousand questions, she appeared incapable of answering them, and, declining assistance, leaned against the casement for support.

'Donna Clara was now advancing with measured step to proffer a bottle of curious essences, which she drew from a pocket of a depth beyond calculation, when one of the female attendants, aware of her favourite habits, proposed reviving her by the scent of the flowers that clustered round the frame of the casement; and collecting a handful of roses, offered them to Isidora. The sight and scent of these beautiful flowers, revived the former associations of Isidora; and, waving away her attendant, she exclaimed, 'There are no roses like those which surrounded me when he beheld me first!'–'He!–who, daughter?' said the alarmed Donna Clara. 'Speak, I charge you, sister,' said the irritable Fernan, 'to whom do you allude?'–'She raves,' said the priest, whose habitual penetration discovered there was a secret,–and whose professional jealousy decided that no one, not mother or brother, should share it with him; 'she raves–ye are to blame–forbear to hang round and to question her. Madonna, retire to rest, and the saints watch round your bed!' Isidora, bending thankfully for this permission, retired to her apartment; and father Jose for an hour appeared to contend with the suspicious fears of Donna Clara, and the sullen irritability of Fernan, merely that he might induce them, in the heat of controversy, to betray all they knew or dreaded, that he might strengthen his own conjectures, and establish his own power by the discovery.



Scire volunt secreta domus, et inde timeri.



And this desire is not only natural but necessary, in a being from whose heart his profession has torn every tie of nature and of passion; and if it generates malignity, ambition, and the wish for mischief, it is the system, not the individual, we must blame.

'Madonna,' said the Father, 'you are always urging your zeal for the Catholic church–and you, Senhor, are always reminding me of the honour of your family–I am anxious for both–and how can the interests of both be better secured than by Donna Isidora taking the veil?'–'The wish of my soul!' cried Donna Clara, clasping her hands, and closing her eyes, as if she witnessed her daughter's apotheosis. 'I will never hear of it, Father,' said Fernan; 'my sister's beauty and wealth entitle me to claim alliance with the first families in Spain–their baboon shapes and copper-coloured visages might be redeemed for a century by such a graft on the stock, and the blood of which they boast would not be impoverished by a transfusion of the aurum potabile of ours into it.'–'You forget, son,' said the priest, 'the extraordinary circumstances attendant on the early part of your sister's life. There are many of our Catholic nobility who would rather see the black blood of the banished Moors, or the proscribed Jews, flow in the veins of their descendants, that that of one who'–Here a mysterious whisper drew from Donna Clara a shudder of distress and consternation, and from her son an impatient motion of angry incredulity. 'I do not credit a word of it,' said the latter; 'you wish that my sister should take the veil, and therefore you credit and circulate the monstrous invention.'–'Take heed, son, I conjure you,' said the trembling Donna Clara. 'Take you heed, Madam, that you do not sacrifice your daughter to an unfounded and incredible fiction.'–'Fiction!' repeated Father Jose–'Senhor, I forgive your illiberal reflections on me,–but let me remind you, that the same immunity will not be extended to the insult you offer to the Catholic faith.'–'Reverend Father,' said the terrified Fernan, 'the Catholic church has not a more devoted and unworthy professor on earth than myself.'–'I do believe the latter,' said the priest. 'You admit all that the holy church teaches to be irrefragably true?'–'To be sure I do.'–'Then you must admit that the islands in the Indian seas are particularly under the influence of the devil?'–'I do, if the church requires me so to believe.'–'And that he possessed a peculiar sway over that island where your sister was lost in her infancy?'–'I do not see how that follows,' said Fernan, making a sudden stand at this premise of the Sorites. 'Not see how that follows!' repeated Father Jose, crossing himself;



Excæcavit oculos corum ne viderent.



But why waste I my Latin and logic on thee, who art incapable of both? Mark me, I will use but one unanswerable argument, the which whoso gainsayeth is a–gainsayer–that's all. The Inquisition at Goa knows the truth of what I have asserted, and who will dare deny it now?'–'Not I!–not I!' exclaimed Donna Clara; 'nor, I am sure, will this stubborn boy. Son, I adjure you, make haste to believe what the reverend Father has told you.'–'I am believing as fast as I can,' answered Don Fernan, in the tone of one who is reluctantly swallowing a distasteful mess; 'but my faith will be choaked if you don't allow it time to swallow. As for digestion,' he muttered, 'let that come when it pleases God.'–'Daughter,' said the priest, who well knew the mollia tempora fandi, and saw that the sullen and angry Fernan could not well bear more at present; 'daughter, it is enough–we must lead with gentleness those whose steps find stumbling-blocks in the paths of grace. Pray with me, daughter, that your son's eyes may yet be opened to the glory and felicity of his sister's vocation to a state where the exhaustless copiousness of divine benignity places the happy inmates above all those mean and mundane anxieties, those petty and local wants, which–Ah!–hem–verily I feel some of those wants myself at this moment. I am hoarse with speaking; and the intense heat of this night hath so exhausted my strength, that methinks the wing of a partridge would be no unseasonable refreshment.'

'At a sign from Donna Clara, a salver with wine appeared, and a partridge that might have provoked the French prelate to renew his meal once more, spite of his horror of toujours perdrix. 'See, daughter, see how much I am exhausted in this distressing controversy–well may I say, the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.'–'Then you and the zeal of the house will soon be quit,' muttered Fernan as he retired. And drawing the folds of his mantle over his shoulder, he threw a glance of wonder at the happy facility with which the priest discussed the wings and breast of his favourite bird,–whispering alternately words of admonition to Donna Clara, and muttering something about the omission of pimento and lemon.

'Father,' said Don Fernan, stalking back from the door, and fronting the priest–'Father, I have a favour to ask of you.'–'Glad, were it in my power to comply with it,' said Father Jose, turning over the skeleton of the fowl; 'but you see here is only the thigh, and that somewhat bare.'–'It is not of that I speak or think, reverend Father,' said Fernan, with a smile; 'I have but to request, that you will not renew the subject of my sister's vocation till the return of my father.'–'Certainly not, son, certainly not. Ah! you know the time to ask a favour–you know I never could refuse you at a moment like this, when my heart is warmed, and softened, and expanded, by–by–by the evidences of your contrition and humiliation, and all that your devout mother, and your zealous spiritual friend, could hope or wish for. In truth, it overcomes me–these tears–I do not often weep but on occasions like these, and then I weep abundantly, and am compelled to recruit my lack of moisture thus.'–'Fetch more wine,' said Donna Clara.–The order was obeyed.–'Good night, Father,' said Don Fernan.–'The saints watch round you, my son! Oh I am exhausted!–I sink in this struggle! The night is hot, and requires wine to slake my thirst–and wine is a provocative, and requires food to take away its deleterious and damnable qualities–and food, especially partridge, which is a hot and stimulative nutritive, requires drink again to absorb or neutralize its exciting qualities. Observe me, Donna Clara–I speak as to the learned. There is stimulation, and there is absorption; the causes of which are manifold, and the effects such as–I am not bound to tell you at present.'–'Reverend Father,' said the admiring Donna Clara, not guessing, in the least, from what source all this eloquence flowed, 'I trespassed on your time merely to ask a favour also.'–'Ask and 'tis granted,' said Father Jose, with a protrusion of his foot as proud as that of Sixtus himself. 'It is merely to know, will not all the inhabitants of those accursed Indian isles be damned everlastingly?'–'Damned everlasting, and without doubt,' returned the priest. 'Now my mind is easy,' rejoined the lady, 'and I shall sleep in peace to-night.'

'Sleep, however, did not visit her so soon as she expected, for an hour after she knocked at Father Jose's door, repeating, 'Damned to all eternity, Father, did you not say?'–'Be damned to all eternity!' said the priest, tossing on his feverish bed, and dreaming, in the intervals of his troubled sleep, of Don Fernan coming to confession with a drawn sword, and Donna Clara with a bottle of Xeres in her hand, which she swallowed at a draught, while his parched lips were gaping for a drop in vain,–and of the Inquisition being established in an island off the coast of Bengal, and a huge partridge seated with a cap on at the end of a table covered with black, as chief Inquisitor,–and various and monstrous chimeras, the abortive births of repletion and indigestion.

'Donna Clara, catching only the last words, returned to her apartment with light step and gladdened heart, and, full of pious consolation, renewed her devotions before the image of the virgin in her apartment, at each side of whose niche two wax tapers were burning, till the cool morning breeze made it possible for her to retire with some hope of rest.

'Isidora, in her apartment, was equally sleepless; and she, too, had prostrated herself before the sacred image, but with different thoughts. Her feverish and dreamy existence, composed of wild and irreconcileable contrasts between the forms of the present, and the visions of the past,–the difference between all that she felt within, and all that she saw around her,–between the impassioned life of recollection, and the monotonous one of reality,–was becoming too much for a heart bursting with undirected sensibilities, and a head giddy from vicissitudes that would have deeply tried much firmer faculties.

'She remained for some time repeating the usual number of ave's, to which she added the litany of the Virgin, without any corresponding impulses of solace or illumination, till at length, feeling that her prayers were not the expressions of her heart, and dreading this heterodoxy of the heart more than the violation of the ritual, she ventured to address the image of the Virgin in language of her own.

'Mild and beautiful Spirit!' she cried, prostrating herself before the figure–'you whose lips alone have smiled on me since I reached your Christian land,–you whose countenance I have sometimes imagined to belong to those who dwelt in the stars of my own Indian sky,–hear me, and be not angry with me! Let me lose all feeling of my present existence, or all memory of the past! Why do my former thoughts return? They once made me happy, now they are thorns in my heart! Why do they retain their power since their nature is altered? I cannot be what I was–Oh, let me then no longer remember it! Let me, if possible, see, feel, and think as those around me do! Alas! I feel it is much easier to descend to their level than to raise them to mine. Time, constraint, and dullness, may do much for me, but what time could ever operate such a change on them! It would be like looking for the pearls at the bottom of the stagnant ponds which art has dug in their gardens. No, mother of the Deity! divine and mysterious woman, no!–they never shall see another throb of my burning heart. Let it consume in its own fires before a drop of their cold compassion extinguishes them! Mother divine! are not burning hearts, then, worthiest of thee?–and does not the love of nature assimilate itself to the love of God! True, we may love without religion, but can we be religious without love? Yet, mother divine! dry up my heart, since there is no longer a channel for its streams to flow through!–or turn all those streams into the river, narrow and cold, that holds its course on to eternity! Why should I think or feel, since life requires only duties that no feeling suggests, and apathy that no reflection disturbs? Here let me rest!–it is indeed the end of enjoyment, but it is also the end of suffering; and a thousand tears are a price too dear for the single smile which is sold for them in the commerce of life. Alas! it is better to wander in perpetual sterility than to be tortured with the remembrance of flowers that have withered, and odours that have died for ever.' Then a gush of uncontroulable emotion overwhelming her, she again bowed before the Virgin. 'Yes, help me to banish every image from my soul but his–his alone! Let my heart be like this lonely apartment, consecrated by the presence of one sole image, and illuminated only by that light which affection kindles before the object of its adoration, and worships it by for ever!'

'In an agony of enthusiasm she continued to kneel before the image; and when she rose, the silence of her apartment, and the calm smile of the celestial figure, seemed at once a contrast and a reproach to this excess of morbid indulgence. That smile appeared to her like a frown. It is certain, that in agitation we can feel no solace from features that express only profound tranquillity. We would rather wish corresponding agitation, even hostility–any thing but a calm that neutralizes and absorbs us. It is the answer of the rock to the wave–we collect, foam, dash, and disperse ourselves against it, and retire broken, shattered, and murmuring to the echoes of our disappointment.

'From the tranquil and hopeless aspect of the divinity, smiling on the misery it neither consoles or relieves, and intimating in that smile the profound and pulseless apathy of inaccessible elevation, coldly hinting that humanity must cease to be, before it can cease to suffer–from this the sufferer rushed for consolation to nature, whose ceaseless agitation seems to correspond with the vicissitudes of human destiny and the emotions of the human heart–whose alternation of storms and calms,–of clouds and sun-light,–of terrors and delights–seems to keep a kind of mysterious measure of ineffable harmony with that instrument whose chords are doomed alternately to the thrill of agony and rapture, till the hand of death sweeps over all the strings, and silences them for ever.–With such a feeling, Isidora leaned against her casement, gasped for a breath of air, which the burning night did not grant, and thought how, on such a night in her Indian isle, she could plunge into the stream shaded by her beloved tamarind, or even venture amid the still and silvery waves of the ocean, laughing at the broken beams of the moonlight, as her light form dimpled the waters–snatching with smiling delight the brilliant, tortuous, and enamelled shells that seemed to woo her white footsteps as she turned to the shore. Now all was different. The duties of the bath had been performed, but with a parade of soaps, perfumes, and, above all, attendants, who, though of her own sex, gave Isidora an unspeakable degree of disgust at the operation. The sponges and odours sickened her unsophisticated senses, and the presence of another human being seemed to close up every pore.

'She had felt no refreshment from the bath, or from her prayers–she sought it at her casement, but there also in vain. The moon was as bright as the sun of colder climates, and the heavens were all in a blaze with her light. She seemed like a gallant vessel ploughing the bright and trackless ocean alone, while a thousand stars burned in the wake of her quiet glory, like attendant vessels pursuing their course to undiscovered worlds, and pointing them out to the mortal eye that lingered on their course, and loved their light.

'Such was the scene above, but what a contrast to the scene below! The glorious and unbounded light fell on an inclosure of stiff parterres, cropped myrtles and orange-trees in tubs, and quadrangular ponds, and bowers of trellis-work, and nature tortured a thousand ways, and indignant and repulsive under her tortures every way.

'Isidora looked and wept. Tears had now become her language when alone–it was a language she dared not utter before her family. Suddenly she saw one of the moonlight alleys darkened by an approaching figure. It advanced–it uttered her name–the name she remembered and loved–the name of Immalee! 'Ah!' she exclaimed, leaning from the casement, 'is there then one who recognizes me by that name?'–'It is only by that name I can address you,' answered the voice of the stranger–'I have not yet the honour of being acquainted with the name your Christian friends have given you.'–'They call me Isidora, but do you still call me Immalee. But how is it,' she added in a trembling voice,–her fears for his safety overcoming all her sudden and innocent joy at his sight–'how is it that you are here?–here, where no human being is ever beheld but the inmates of the mansion?–how did you cross the garden wall?–how did you come from India? Oh! retire for your own safety! I am among those whom I cannot trust or love. My mother is severe–my brother is violent. Oh! how did you obtain entrance into the garden?–How is it,' she added in a broken voice, 'that you risk so much to see one whom you have forgotten so long?'–'Fair Neophyte, beautiful Christian,' answered the stranger, with a diabolical sneer, 'be it known to you that I regard bolts, and bars, and walls, as much as I did the breakers and rocks of your Indian isle–that I can go where, and retire when I please, without leave asked or taken of your brother's mastiffs, or Toledos, or spring-guns, and in utter defiance of your mother's advanced guard of duennas, armed in spectacles, and flanked with a double ammunition of rosaries, with beads as large as–' 'Hush!–hush!–do not utter such impious sounds–I am taught to revere those holy things. But is it you?–and did I indeed see you last night, or was it a thought such as visits me in dreams, and wraps me again in visions of that beautiful and blessed isle where first I–Oh that I never had seen you!'–'Lovely Christian! be reconciled to your horrible destiny. You saw me last night–I crossed your path twice when you were sparkling among the brightest and most beautiful of all Madrid. It was me you saw–I rivetted your eye–I transfixed your slender frame as with a flash of lightning–you fell fainting and withered under my burning glance. It was me you saw–me, the disturber of your angelical existence in that isle of paradise–the hunter of your form and your steps, even amid the complicated and artificial tracks in which you have been concealed by the false forms of the existence you have embraced!'–'Embraced!–Oh no! they seized on me–they dragged me here–they made me a Christian. They told me all was for my salvation, for my happiness here and hereafter–and I trust it will, for I have been so miserable ever since, that I ought to be happy somewhere.'–'Happy,' repeated the stranger with his withering sneer–'and are you not happy now? The delicacy of your exquisite frame is no longer exposed to the rage of the elements–the fine and feminine luxury of your taste is solicited and indulged by a thousand inventions of art–your bed is of down–your chamber hung with tapestry. Whether the moon be bright or dark, six wax tapers burn in your chamber all night. Whether the skies be bright or cloudy,–whether the earth be clothed with flowers, or deformed with tempests,–the art of the limner has surrounded you with 'a new heaven and a new earth;' and you may bask in suns that never set, while the heavens are dark to other eyes,–and luxuriate amid landscapes and flowers, while half your fellow-creatures are perishing amid snows and tempests!' (Such was the over-flowing acrimony of this being, that he could not speak of the beneficence of nature, or the luxuries of art, without interweaving something that seemed like a satire on, or a scorn of both.) 'You also have intellectual beings to converse with instead of the chirpings of loxias, and the chatterings of monkeys.'–'I have not found the conversation I encounter much more intelligible or significant,' murmured Isidora, but the stranger did not appear to hear her. 'You are surrounded by every thing that can flatter the senses, intoxicate the imagination, or expand the heart. All these indulgences must make you forget the voluptuous but unrefined liberty of your former existence.'–'The birds in my mother's cages,' said Isidora, 'are for ever pecking at their gilded bars, and trampling on the clear seeds and limpid water they are supplied with–would they not rather rest in the mossy trunk of a doddered oak, and drink of whatever stream they met, and be at liberty, at all the risk of poorer food and fouler drink–would they not rather do anything than break their bills against gilded wires?'–'Then you do not feel your new existence in this Christian land so likely to surfeit you with delight as you once thought? For shame, Immalee–shame on your ingratitude and caprice! Do you remember when from your Indian isle you caught a glimpse of the Christian worship, and were entranced at the sight?'–'I remember all that ever passed in that isle. My life formerly was all anticipation,–now it is all retrospection. The life of the happy is all hopes,–that of the unfortunate all memory. Yes, I remember catching a glimpse of that religion so beautiful and pure; and when they brought me to a Christian land, I thought I should have found them all Christians.'–'And what did you find them, then, Immalee?'–'Only Catholics.'–'Are you aware of the danger of the words you utter? Do you know that in this country to hint a doubt of Catholicism and Christianity being the same, would consign you to the flames as a heretic incorrigible? Your mother, so lately known to you as a mother, would bind your hands when the covered litter came for its victim; and your father, though he has never yet beheld you, would buy with his last ducat the faggots that were to consume you to ashes; and all your relations in their gala robes would shout their hallelujahs to your dying screams of torture. Do you know that the Christianity of these countries is diametrically opposite to the Christianity of that world of which you caught a gleam, and which you may see recorded in the pages of your Bible, if you are permitted to read it?'

'Isidora wept, and confessed she had not found Christianity what she had at first believed it; but with her wild and eccentric ingenuousness, she accused herself the next moment of her confession,–and she added, 'I am so ignorant in this new world,–I have so much to learn,–my senses so often deceive me,–and my habits and perceptions so different from what they ought to be–I mean from what those around me are–that I should not speak or think but as I am taught. Perhaps, after some years of instruction and suffering, I may be able to discover that happiness cannot exist in this new world, and Christianity is not so remote from Catholicism as it appears to me now.'–'And have you not found yourself happy in this new world of intelligence and luxury?' said Melmoth, in a tone of involuntary softness. 'I have at times.'–'What times?'–'When the weary day was over, and my dreams bore me back to that island of enchantment. Sleep is to me like some bark rowed by visionary pilots, that wafts me to shores of beauty and blessedness,–and all night long I revel in my dreams with spirits. Again I live among flowers and odours–a thousand voices sing to me from the brooks and the breezes–the air is all alive and eloquent with invisible melodists–I walk amid a breathing atmosphere, and living and loving inanimation–blossoms that shed themselves beneath my steps–and streams that tremble to kiss my feet, and then retire; and then return again, wasting themselves in fondness before me, and touching me, as my lips press the holy images they have taught me to worship here!'–'Does no other image ever visit your dreams, Immalee?'–'I need not tell you,' said Isidora, with that singular mixture of natural firmness, and partial obscuration of intellect,–the combined result of her original and native character, and extraordinary circumstances of her early existence–'I need not tell you–you know you are with me every night!'–'Me?'–'Yes, you; you are for ever in that canoe that bears me to the Indian isle–you gaze on me, but your expression is so changed, that I dare not speak to you–we fly over the seas in a moment, but you are for ever at the helm, though you never land–the moment the paradise isle appears, you disappear; and as we return, the ocean is all dark, and our course is as dark and swift as the storm that sweeps them–you look at me, but never speak–Oh yes! you are with me every night!'–'But, Immalee, these are all dreams–idle dreams. I row you over the Indian seas from Spain!–this is all a vision of your imagination.'–'Is it a dream that I see you now?' said Isidora–'is it a dream that I talk with you?–Tell me, for my senses are bewildered; and it appears to me no less strange, that you should be here in Spain, than that I should be in my native island. Alas! in the life that I now lead, dreams have become realities, and realities seem only like dreams. How is it you are here, if indeed you are here?–how is it that you have wandered so far to see me? How many oceans you must have crossed, how many isles you must have seen, and none like that where I first beheld you! But is it you indeed I behold? I thought I saw you last night, but I had rather trust even my dreams than my senses. I believed you only a visitor of that isle of visions, and a haunter of the visions that recall it–but are you in truth a living being, and one whom I may hope to behold in this land of cold realities and Christian horrors?'–'Beautiful Immalee, or Isidora, or whatever other name your Indian worshippers, or Christian god-fathers and god-mothers, have called you by, I pray you listen to me, while I expound a few mysteries to you.' And Melmoth, as he spoke, flung himself on a bed of hyacinths and tulips that displayed their glowing flowers, and sent up their odorous breath right under Isidora's casement. 'Oh you will destroy my flowers!' cried she, while a reminiscence of her former picturesque existence, when flowers were the companions alike of her imagination and her pure heart, awoke her exclamation. 'It is my vocation–I pray you pardon me!' said Melmoth, as he basked on the crushed flowers, and darted his withering sneer and scowling glance at Isidora. 'I am commissioned to trample on and bruise every flower in the natural and moral world–hyacinths, hearts, and bagatelles of that kind, just as they occur. And now, Donna Isidora, with as long an et cetera as you or your sponsors could wish, and with no possible offence to the herald, here I am to-night–and where I shall be to-morrow night, depends on your choice. I would as soon be on the Indian seas, where your dreams send me rowing every night, or crashing through the ice near the Poles, or ploughing with my naked corse, (if corses have feeling), through the billows of that ocean where I must one day (a day that has neither sun or moon, neither commencement or termination), plough forever, and reap despair!'–'Hush!–hush!–Oh forbear such horrid sounds! Are you indeed he whom I saw in the isle? Are you he, inwoven ever since that moment with my prayers, my hopes, my heart? Are you that being upon whom hope subsisted, when life itself was failing? On my passage to this Christian land, I suffered much. I was so ill you would have pitied me–the clothes they put on me–the language they made me speak–the religion they made me believe–the country they brought me to–Oh you!–you alone!–the thought–the image of you, could alone have supported me! I loved, and to love is to live. Amid the disruption of every natural tie,–amid the loss of that delicious existence which seems a dream, and which still fills my dreams, and makes sleep a second existence,–I have thought of you–have dreamt of you–have loved you!'–'Loved me?–no being yet loved me but pledged me in tears.'–'And have I not wept?' said Isidora–'believe these tears–they are not the first I have shed, nor I fear will be the last, since I owe the first to you.' And she wept as she spoke. 'Well,' said the wanderer, with a bitter and self-satirizing laugh, 'I shall be persuaded at last that I am 'a marvellous proper man.' Well, if it must be so, happy man be his dole! And when shall the auspicious day, beautiful Immalee, still beautiful Isidora, in spite of your Christian name, (to which I have a most anti-catholic objection)–when shall that bright day dawn on your long slumbering eye-lashes, and waken them with kisses, and beams, and light, and love, and all the paraphernalia with which folly arrays misery previous to their union–that glittering and empoisoned drapery that well resembles what of old Dejanira sent to her husband–when shall the day of bliss be?' And he laughed with that horrible convulsion that mingles the expression of levity with that of despair, and leaves the listener no doubt whether there is more despair in laughter, or more laughter in despair. 'I understand you not,' said the pure and timid Isidora; 'and if you would not terrify me to madness, laugh no more–no more, at least, in that fearful way!'–'I cannot weep,' said Melmoth, fixing on her his dry and burning eyes, strikingly visible in the moonlight; 'the fountain of tears has been long dried up within me, like that of every other human blessing.'–'I can weep for both,' said Isidora, 'if that be all.' And her tears flowed fast, as much from memory as from grief–and when those sources are united, God and the sufferer only know how fast and bitterly they fall. 'Reserve them for our nuptial hour, my lovely bride,' said Melmoth to himself; 'you will have occasion for them then.'

'There was a custom then, however indelicate and repulsive it may sound to modern ears, for ladies who were doubtful of the intentions of their lovers to demand of them the proof of their purity and honour, by requiring an appeal to their family, and a solemn union under the sanction of the church. Perhaps there was more genuine spirit of truth and chastity in this, than in all the ambiguous flirtation that is carried on with an ill-understood and mysterious dependence on principles that have never been defined, and fidelity that has never been removed. When the lady in the Italian tragedy asks her lover, almost at their first interview, if his intentions are honourable, and requires, as the proof of their being so, that he shall espouse her immediately, does she not utter a language more unsophisticated, more intelligible, more heartedly pure, than all the romantic and incredible reliance that other females are supposed to place in the volatility of impulse,–in that wild and extemporaneous feeling,–that 'house on the sands,'–which never has its foundation in the immoveable depths of the heart. Yielding to this feeling, Isidora, in a voice that faultered at its own accents, murmured, 'If you love me, seek me no more clandestinely. My mother is good, though she is austere–my brother is kind, though he is passionate–my father–I have never seen him! I know not what to say, but if he be my father, he will love you. Meet me in their presence, and I will no longer feel pain and shame mingled with the delight of seeing you. Invoke the sanction of the church, and then, perhaps,'–'Perhaps!' retorted Melmoth; 'You have learned the European 'perhaps!'–the art of suspending the meaning of an emphatic word–of affecting to draw the curtain of the heart at the moment you drop its folds closer and closer–of bidding us despair at the moment you intend we should feel hope!'–'Oh no!–no!' answered the innocent being; 'I am truth. I am Immalee when I speak to you,–though to all others in this country, which they call Christian, I am Isidora. When I loved you first, I had only one heart to consult,–now there are many, and some who have not hearts like mine. But if you love me, you can bend to them as I have done–you can love their God, their home, their hopes, and their country. Even with you I could not be happy, unless you adored the cross to which your hand first pointed my wandering sight, and the religion which you reluctantly confessed was the most beautiful and beneficent on earth.'–'Did I confess that?' echoed Melmoth; 'It must have been reluctantly indeed. Beautiful Immalee! I am a convert to you;' and he stifled a Satanic laugh as he spoke; 'to your new religion, and your beauty, and your Spanish birth and nomenclature, and every thing that you would wish. I will incontinently wait on your pious mother, and angry brother, and all your relatives, testy, proud, and ridiculous as they may be. I will encounter the starched ruffs, and rustling manteaus, and whale-boned fardingales of the females, from your good mother down to the oldest duenna who sits spectacled, and armed with bobbin, on her inaccessible and untempted sopha; and the twirled whiskers, plumed hats, and shouldered capas of all your male relatives. And I will drink chocolate, and strut among them; and when they refer me to your mustachoed man of law, with his thread-bare cloke of black velvet over his shoulder, his long quill in his hand, and his soul in three sheets of wide-spread parchment, I will dower you in the most ample territory ever settled on a bride.'–'Oh let it be, then, in that land of music and sunshine where we first met! One spot where I might set my foot amid its flowers, is worth all the cultivated earth of Europe!' said Isidora.–'No!–it shall be in a territory with which your bearded men of law are far better acquainted, and which even your pious mother and proud family must acknowledge my claim to, when they shall hear it asserted and explained. Perchance they may be joint-tenants with me there; and yet (strange to say!) they will never litigate my exclusive title to possession.'–'I understand nothing of this,' said Isidora; 'but I feel I am transgressing the decorums of a Spanish female and a Christian, in holding this conference with you any longer. If you think as you once thought,–if you feel as I must feel for ever,–there needs not this discussion, which only perplexes and terrifies. What have I to do with this territory of which you speak? That you are its possessor, is its only value in my eyes!'–'What have you to do with it?' repeated Melmoth; 'Oh, you know not how much you may have to do with it and me yet! In other cases, the possession of the territory is the security for the man,–but here the man is the security for the everlasting possession of the territory. Mine heirs must inherit it for ever and ever, if they hold by my tenure. Listen to me, beautiful Immalee, or Christian, or whatever other name you choose to be called by! Nature, your first sponsor, baptized you with the dews of Indian roses–your Christian sponsors, of course, spared not water, salt, or oil, to wash away the stain of nature from your regenerated frame–and your last sponsor, if you will submit to the rite, will anoint you with a new chrism. But of that hereafter. Listen to me while I announce to you the wealth, the population, the magnificence of that region to which I will endower you. The rulers of the earth are there–all of them. There be the heroes, and the sovereigns, and the tyrants. There are their riches, and pomp, and power–Oh what a glorious accumulation!–and they have thrones, and crowns, and pedestals, and trophies of fire, that burn for ever and ever, and the light of their glory blazes eternally. There are all you read of in story, your Alexanders and Cæsars, your Ptolemies and Pharaohs. There be the princes of the East, the Nimrods, the Belshazzars, and the Holoferneses of their day. There are the princes of the North, the Odins, the Attilas, (named by your church the scourge of God), the Alarics, and all those nameless and name-undeserving barbarians, who, under various titles and claims, ravaged and ruined the earth they came to conquer. There be the sovereigns of the South, and East, and West, the Mahommedans, the Caliphs, the Saracens, the Moors, with all their gorgeous pretensions and ornaments–the crescent, the Koran, and the horse-tail–the trump, the gong, and the atabal, (or to suit it to your Christianised ear, lovely Neophyte!) 'the noise of the captains, and the shoutings.' There be also those triple-crowned chieftains of the West, who hide their shorn heads under a diadem, and for every hair they shave, demand the life of a sovereign–who, pretending to humility, trample on power–whose title is, Servant of servants–and whose claim and recognizance is, Lord of lords. Oh! you will not lack company in that bright region, for bright it will be!–and what matter whether its light be borrowed from the gleam of sulphur, or the trembling light of the moon, by which I see you look so pale?'–'I look pale?' said Isidora gasping; 'I feel pale! I know not the meaning of your words, but I know it must be horrible. Speak no more of that region, with its pride, its wickedness, and its splendour! I am willing to follow you to deserts, to solitudes, which human step never trod but yours, and where mine shall trace, with sole fidelity, the print of yours. Amid loneliness I was born; amid loneliness I could die. Let me but, wherever I live, and whenever I die, be yours!–and for the place, it matters not, let it be even'–and she shivered involuntarily as she spoke; 'Let it be even'–'Even–where?' asked Melmoth, while a wild feeling of triumph in the devotedness of this unfortunate female, and of horror at the destination which she was unconsciously imprecating on herself, mingled in the question. 'Even where you are to be,' answered the devoted Isidora, 'Let me be there! and there I must be happy, as in the isle of flowers and sunlight, where I first beheld you. Oh! there are no flowers so balmy and roseate as those that once blew there! There are no waters so musical, or breezes so fragrant, as those that I listened to and inhaled, when I thought that they repeated to me the echo of your steps, or the melody of your voice–that human music the first I ever heard, and which, when I cease to hear'–'You will hear much better!' interrupted Melmoth; 'the voices often thousand–ten millions of spirits–beings whose tones are immortal, without cessation, without pause, without interval!'–'Oh that will be glorious!' said Isidora, clasping her hands; 'the only language I have learned in this new world worth speaking, is the language of music. I caught some imperfect sounds from birds in my first world, but in my second world they taught me music; and the misery they have taught me, hardly makes a balance against that new and delicious language.'–'But think,' rejoined Melmoth, 'if your taste for music be indeed so exquisite, how it will be indulged, how it will be enlarged, in hearing those voices accompanied and reechoed by the thunders of ten thousand billows of fire, lashing against rocks which eternal despair has turned into adamant! They talk of the music of the spheres!–Dream of the music of those living orbs turning on their axis of fire for ever and ever, and ever singing as they shine, like your brethren the Christians, who had the honour to illuminate Nero's garden in Rome on a rejoicing night.'–'You make me tremble!'–'Tremble!–a strange effect of fire. Fie! what a coyness is this! I have promised, on your arrival at your new territory, all that is mighty and magnificent,–all that is splendid and voluptuous–the sovereign and the sensualist–the inebriated monarch and the pampered slave–the bed of roses and the canopy of fire!'–'And is this the home to which you invite me?'–'It is–it is. Come, and be mine!–myriads of voices summon you–hear and obey them! Their voices thunder in the echoes of mine–their fires flash from my eyes, and blaze in my heart. Hear me, Isidora, my beloved, hear me! I woo you in earnest, and for ever! Oh how trivial are the ties by which mortal lovers are bound, compared to those in which you and I shall be bound to eternity! Fear not the want of a numerous and splendid society. I have enumerated sovereigns, and pontiffs, and heroes,–and if you should condescend to remember the trivial amusements of your present sejour, you will have enough to revive its associations. You love music, and doubtless you will have most of the musicians who have chromatized since the first essays of Tubal Cain to Lully, who beat himself to death at one of his own oratorios, or operas, I don't know which. They will have a singular accompaniment–the eternal roar of a sea of fire makes a profound bass to the chorus of millions of singers in torture!'–'What is the meaning of this horrible description?' said the trembling Isidora; 'your words are riddles to me. Do you jest with me for the sake of tormenting, or of laughing at me?'–'Laughing!' repeated her wild visitor; 'that is an exquisite hint–vive la bagatelle! Let us laugh for ever!–we shall have enough to keep us in countenance. There will be all that ever have dared to laugh on earth–the singers, the dancers, the gay, the voluptuous, the brilliant, the beloved–all who have ever dared to mistake their destiny, so far as to imagine that enjoyment was not a crime, or that a smile was not an infringement of their duty as sufferers. All such must expiate their error under circumstances which will probably compel the most inveterate disciple of Democritus, the most inextinguishable laugher among them, to allow that there, at least, 'laughter is madness.'–'I do not understand you,' said Isidora, listening to him with that sinking of the heart which is produced by a combined and painful feeling of ignorance and terror. 'Not understand me?' repeated Melmoth, with that sarcastic frigidity of countenance which frightfully contrasted the burning intelligence of his eyes, that seemed like the fires of a volcano bursting out amid masses of snow heaped up to its very edge; 'not understand me!–are you not, then, fond of music?'–'I am.'–'Of dancing, too, my graceful, beautiful love?'–'I was.'–'What is the meaning of the different emphasis you give to those answers?'–'I love music–I must love it for ever–it is the language of recollection. A single strain of it wafts me back to the dreamy blessedness, the enchanted existence, of my own–own isle. Of dancing I cannot say so much. I have learnt dancing–but I felt music. I shall never forget the hour when I heard it for the first time, and imagined it was the language which Christians spoke to each other. I have heard them speak a different language since.'–'Doubtless their language is not always melody, particularly when they address each other on controverted points in religion. Indeed, I can conceive nothing less a-kin to harmony than the debate of a Dominican and Franciscan on the respective efficacy of the cowl of the order, to ascertain the salvation of him who happens to die in it. But have you no other reason for being fond of music, and for only having been fond of dancing? Nay, let me have 'your most exquisite reason.'



1 Alluding possibly to 'Romeo and Juliet.'



'It seemed as if this unhappy being was impelled by his ineffable destiny to deride the misery he inflicted, in proportion to its bitterness. His sarcastic levity bore a direct and fearful proportion to his despair. Perhaps this is also the case in circumstances and characters less atrocious. A mirth which is not gaiety is often the mask which hides the convulsed and distorted features of agony–and laughter, which never yet was the expression of rapture, has often been the only intelligible language of madness and misery. Extacy only smiles,–despair laughs. It seemed, too, as if no keenness of ironical insult, no menace of portentous darkness, had power to revolt the feelings, or alarm the apprehensions, of the devoted being to whom they were addressed. Her 'most exquisite reasons,' demanded in a tone of ruthless irony, were given in one whose exquisite and tender melody seemed still to retain the modulation on which its first sounds had been formed,–that of the song of birds, mingled with the murmur of waters.

'I love music, because when I hear it I think of you. I have ceased to love dancing, though I was at first intoxicated with it, because, when dancing, I have sometimes forgot you. When I listen to music, your image floats on every note,–I hear you in every sound. The most inarticulate murmurs that I produce on my guitar (for I am very ignorant) are like a spell of melody that raises a form indescribable–not you, but my idea of you. In your presence, though that seems necessary to my existence, I have never felt that exquisite delight that I have experienced in that of your image, when music has called it up from the recesses of my heart. Music seems to me like the voice of religion summoning to remember and worship the God of my heart. Dancing appears like a momentary apostasy, almost a profanation.'–'That, indeed, is a sweet and subtle reason,' answered Melmoth, 'and one that, of course, has but one failure,–that of not being sufficiently flattering to the hearer. And so my image floats on the rich and tremulous waves of melody one moment, like a god of the overflowing billows of music, triumphing in their swells, and graceful even in their falls,–and the next moment appears, like the dancing demon of your operas, grinning at you between the brilliant movement of your fandangoes, and flinging the withering foam of his black and convulsed lips into the cup where you pledge at your banquetting. Well–dancing–music–let them go together! It seems that my image is equally mischievous in both–in one you are tortured by reminiscence, and in the other by remorse. Suppose that image is withdrawn from you for ever,–suppose that it were possible to break the tie that unites us, and whose vision has entered into the soul of both.'–'You may suppose it,' said Isidora, with maiden pride and tender grief blended in her voice; 'and if you do, believe that I will try to suppose it too; the effort will not cost much,–nothing but–my life!'

'As Melmoth beheld this blessed and beautiful being, once so refined amid nature, and now so natural amid refinement, still possessing all the soft luxuriance of her first angelic nature, amid the artificial atmosphere where her sweets were uninhaled, and her brilliant tints doomed to wither unappreciated,–where her pure and sublime devotedness of heart was doomed to beat like a wave against a rock,–exhaust its murmurs,–and expire;–As he felt this, and gazed on her, he cursed himself; and then, with the selfishness of hopeless misery, he felt that the curse might, by dividing it, be diminished.

'Isidora!' he whispered in the softest tones he could assume, approaching the casement, at which his pale and beautiful victim stood; 'Isidora! will you then be mine?'–'What shall I say?' said Isidora; 'if love requires the answer, I have said enough; if only vanity, I have said too much.'–'Vanity! beautiful trifler, you know not what you say; the accusing angel himself might blot out that article from the catalogue of my sins. It is one of my prohibited and impossible offences; it is an earthly feeling, and therefore one which I can neither participate or enjoy. Certain it is that I feel some share of human pride at this moment.'–'Pride! at what? Since I have known you, I have felt no pride but that of supreme devotedness,–that self-annihilating pride which renders the victim prouder of its wreath, than the sacrificer of his office.'–'But I feel another pride,' answered Melmoth, and in a proud tone he spoke it,–'a pride, which, like that of the storm that visited the ancient cities, whose destruction you may have read of, while it blasts, withers, and encrusts paintings, gems, music, and festivity, grasping them in its talons of annihilation, exclaims, Perish to all the world, perhaps beyond the period of its existence, but live to me in darkness and in corruption! Preserve all the exquisite modulation of your forms! all the indestructible brilliancy of your colouring!–but preserve it for me alone!–me, the single, pulseless, eyeless, heartless embracer of an unfertile bride,–the brooder over the dark and unproductive nest of eternal sterility,–the mountain whose lava of internal fire has stifled, and indurated, and inclosed for ever, all that was the joy of earth, the felicity of life, and the hope of futurity!'

'As he spoke, his expression was at once so convulsed and so derisive, so indicative of malignity and levity, so thrilling to the heart, while it withered every fibre it touched and wrung, that Isidora, with all her innocent and helpless devotedness, could not avoid shuddering before this fearful being, while, in trembling and unappeaseable solicitude, she demanded, 'Will you then be mine? Or what am I to understand from your terrible words? Alas! my heart has never enveloped itself in mysteries–never has the light of its truth burst forth amid the thunderings and burnings in which you have issued the law of my destiny.'–'Will you then be mine, Isidora?'–'Consult my parents. Wed me by the rites, and in the face of the church, of which I am an unworthy member, and I will be yours for ever.'–'For ever!' repeated Melmoth; 'well-spoken, my bride. You will then be mine for ever?–will you, Isidora?'–'Yes!–yes!–I have said so. But the sun is about to rise, I feel the increasing perfume of the orange blossoms, and the coolness of the morning air. Begone–I have staid too long here–the domestics may be about, and observe you–begone, I implore you.'–'I go–but one word–for to me the rising of the sun, and the appearance of your domestics, and every thing in heaven above, and earth beneath, is equally unimportant. Let the sun stay below the horizon and wait for me. You are mine!'–'Yes, I am yours; but you must solicit my family.'–'Oh, doubtless!–solicitation is so congenial to my habits.'–'And'–'Well, what?–you hesitate.'–'I hesitate,' said the ingenuous and timid Isidora, 'because'–'Well?'–'Because,' she added, bursting into tears, 'those with whom you speak will not utter to God language like mine. They will speak to you of wealth and dower; they will inquire about that region where you have told me your rich and wide possessions are held; and should they ask me of them, how shall I answer?'

'At these words, Melmoth approached as close as possible to the casement, and uttered a certain word which Isidora did not at first appear to hear, or understand–trembling she repeated her request. In a still lower tone the answer was returned. Incredulous, and hoping that the answer had deceived her, she again repeated her petition. A withering monosyllable, not to be told, thundered in her ears,–and she shrieked as she closed the casement. Alas! the casement only shut out the form of the stranger–not his image.'





CHAPTER XXI



He saw the eternal fire that keeps,
In the unfathomable deeps,
Its power for ever, and made a sign
To the morning prince divine;
Who came across the sulphurous flood,
Obedient to the master-call,
And in angel-beauty stood,
High on his star-lit pedestal.


'In this part of the manuscript, which I read in the vault of Adonijah the Jew,' said Monçada, continuing his narrative, 'there were several pages destroyed, and the contents of many following wholly obliterated–nor could Adonijah supply the deficiency. From the next pages that were legible, it appeared that Isidora imprudently continued to permit her mysterious visitor to frequent the garden at night, and to converse with him from the casement, though unable to prevail on him to declare himself to her family, and perhaps conscious that his declaration would not be too favourably received. Such, at least, appeared to be the meaning of the next lines I could decypher.

'She had renewed, in these nightly conferences, her former visionary existence. Her whole day was but a long thought of the hour at which she expected to see him. In the day-time she was silent, pensive, abstracted, feeding on thought–with the evening her spirits perceptibly though softly rose, like those of one who has a secret and incommunicable store of delight; and her mind became like that flower that unfolds its leaves, and diffuses its odours, only on the approach of night.

'The season favoured this fatal delusion. It was that rage of summer when we begin to respire only towards evening, and the balmy and brilliant night is our day. The day itself is passed in a languid and feverish doze. At night alone she existed,–at her moon-lit casement alone she breathed freely; and never did the moonlight fall on a lovelier form, or gild a more angelic brow, or gleam on eyes that returned more pure and congenial rays. The mutual and friendly light seemed like the correspondence of spirits who glided on the alternate beams, and, passing from the glow of the planet to the glory of a mortal eye, felt that to reside in either was heaven.

* * * *

'She lingered at that casement till she imagined that the clipped and artificially straitened treillage of the garden was the luxuriant and undulating foliage of the trees of her paradise isle–that the flowers had the same odour as that of the untrained and spontaneous roses that once showered their leaves under her naked feet–that the birds sung to her as they had once done when the vesper-hymn of her pure heart ascended along with their closing notes, and formed the holiest and most acceptable anthem that perhaps ever wooed the evening-breeze to waft it to heaven.

'This delusion would soon cease. The stiff and stern monotony of the parterre, where even the productions of nature held their place as if under the constraint of duty, forced the conviction of its unnatural regularity on her eye and soul, and she turned to heaven for relief. Who does not, even in the first sweet agony of passion? Then we tell that tale to heaven which we would not trust to the ear of mortal–and in the withering hour that must come to all whose love is only mortal, we again call on that heaven which we have intrusted with our secret, to send us back one bright messenger of consolation on those thousand rays that its bright, and cold, and passionless orbs, are for ever pouring on the earth as if in mockery. We ask, but is the petition heard or answered? We weep, but do not we feel that those tears are like rain falling on the sea? Mare infructuosum. No matter. Revelation assures us there is a period coming, when all petitions suited to our state shall be granted, and when 'tears shall be wiped from all eyes.' In revelation, then, let us trust–in any thing but our own hearts. But Isidora had not yet learned that theology of the skies, whose text is, 'Let us go into the house of mourning.' To her still the night was day, and her sun was the 'moon walking in its brightness.' When she beheld it, the recollections of the isle rushed on her heart like a flood; and a figure soon appeared to recal and to realize them.

'That figure appeared to her every night without disturbance or interruption; and though her knowledge of the severe restraint and regularity of the household caused her some surprise at the facility with which Melmoth apparently defied both, and visited the garden every night, yet such was the influence of her former dream-like and romantic existence, that his continued presence, under circumstances so extraordinary, never drew from her a question with regard to the means by which he was enabled to surmount difficulties insurmountable to all others.

'There were, indeed, two extraordinary circumstances attendant on these meetings. Though seeing each other again in Spain, after an interval of three years elapsing since they had parted on the shores of an isle in the Indian sea, neither had ever inquired what circumstances could have led to a meeting so unexpected and extraordinary. On Isidora's part this incurious feeling was easily accounted for. Her former existence had been one of such a fabulous and fantastic character, that the improbable had become familiar to her,–and the familiar only, improbable. Wonders were her natural element; and she felt, perhaps, less surprised at seeing Melmoth in Spain, than when she first beheld him treading the sands of her lonely island. With Melmoth the cause was different, though the effect was the same. His destiny forbid alike curiosity or surprise. The world could show him no greater marvel than his own existence; and the facility with which he himself passed from region to region, mingling with, yet distinct from all his species, like a wearied and uninterested spectator rambling through the various seats of some vast theatre, where he knows none of the audience, would have prevented his feeling astonishment, had he encountered Isidora on the summit of the Andes.

'During a month, through the course of which she had tacitly permitted these nightly visits beneath her casement–(at a distance which indeed might have defied Spanish jealousy itself to devise matter of suspicion out of,–the balcony of her window being nearly fourteen feet above the level of the garden, where Melmoth stood)–during this month, Isidora rapidly, but imperceptibly, graduated through those stages of feeling which all who love have alike experienced, whether the stream of passion be smooth or obstructed. In the first, she was full of anxiety to speak and to listen, to hear and to be heard. She had all the wonders of her new existence to relate; and perhaps that indefinite and unselfish hope of magnifying herself in the eyes of him she loved, which induces us in our first encounter to display all the eloquence, all the powers, all the attractions we possess, not with the pride of a competitor, but with the humiliation of a victim. The conquered city displays all its wealth in hopes of propitiating the conqueror. It decorates him with all its spoils, and feels prouder to behold him arrayed in them, than when she wore them in triumph herself. That is the first bright hour of excitement, of trembling, but hopeful and felicitous anxiety. Then we think we never can display enough of talent, of imagination, of all that can interest, of all that can dazzle. We pride ourselves in the homage we receive from society, from the hope of sacrificing that homage to our beloved–we feel a pure and almost spiritualized delight in our own praises, from imagining they render us more worthy of meriting his, from whom we have received the grace of love to deserve them–we glorify ourselves, that we may be enabled to render back the glory to him from whom we received it, and for whom we have kept it in trust, only to tender it back with that rich and accumulated interest of the heart, of which we would pay the uttermost farthing, if the payment exacted the last vibration of its fibres,–the last drop of its blood. No saint who ever viewed a miracle performed by himself with a holy and self-annihilating abstraction from seity, has perhaps felt a purer sentiment of perfect devotedness, than the female who, in her first hours of love, offers, at the feet of her worshipped one, the brilliant wreath of music, painting, and eloquence,–and only hopes, with an unuttered sigh, that the rose of love will not be unnoticed in the garland.

'Oh! how delicious it is to such a being (and such was Isidora) to touch her harp amid crowds, and watch, when the noisy and tasteless bravoes have ceased, for the heart-drawn sigh of the one, to whom alone her soul, not her fingers, have played,–and whose single sigh is heard, and heard alone, amid the plaudits of thousands! Yet how delicious to her to whisper to herself, 'I heard his sigh, but he has heard the applause!'

'And when she glides through the dance, and in touching, with easy and accustomed grace, the hands of many, she feels there is but one hand whose touch she can recognize; and, waiting for its thrilling and life-like vibration, moves on like a statue, cold and graceful, till the Pygmalion-touch warms her into woman, and the marble melts into flesh under the hands of the resistless moulder. And her movements betray, at that moment, the unwonted and half-unconscious impulses of that fair image to which love had given life, and who luxuriated in the vivid and newly-tried enjoyment of that animation which the passion of her lover had breathed into her frame. And when the splendid portfolio is displayed, or the richly-wrought tapestry expanded by outstretched arms, and cavaliers gaze, and ladies envy, and every eye is busy in examination, and every tongue loud in praise, just in the inverted proportion of the ability of the one to scrutinize with accuracy, and the other to applaud with taste–then to throw round the secret silent glance, that searches for that eye whose light alone, to her intoxicated gaze, contains all judgment, all taste, all feeling–for that lip whose very censure would be dearer than the applause of a world!–To hear, with soft and submissive tranquillity, censure and remark, praise and comment, but to turn for ever the appealing look to one who alone can understand, and whose swiftly-answering glance can alone reward it!–This–this had been Isidora's hope. Even in the isle where he first saw her in the infancy of her intellect, she had felt the consciousness of superior powers, which were then her solace, not her pride. Her value for herself rose with her devotion to him. Her passion became her pride: and the enlarged resources of her mind, (for Christianity under its most corrupt form enlarges every mind), made her at first believe, that to behold her admired as she was for her loveliness, her talents, and her wealth, would compel this proudest and most eccentric of beings to prostrate himself before her, or at least to acknowledge the power of those acquirements which she had so painfully been arrived at the knowledge of, since her involuntary introduction into European society.

'This had been her hope during the earlier period of his visits; but innocent and flattering to its object as it was, she was disappointed. To Melmoth 'nothing was new under the sun.' Talent was to him a burden. He knew more than man could tell him, or woman either. Accomplishments were a bauble–the rattle teazed his ear, and he flung it away. Beauty was a flower he looked on only to scorn, and touched only to wither. Wealth and distinction he appreciated as they deserved, but not with the placid disdain of the philosopher, or the holy abstraction of the saint, but with that 'fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,' to which he believed their possessors irreversibly devoted, and to the infliction of which he looked forward with perhaps a feeling like that of those executioners who, at the command of Mithridates, poured the melted ore of his golden chains down the throat of the Roman ambassador.

'With such feelings, and others that cannot be told, Melmoth experienced an indescribable relief from the eternal fire that was already kindled within him, in the perfect and unsullied freshness of what may be called the untrodden verdure of Immalee's heart,–for she was Immalee still to him. She was the Oasis of his desert–the fountain at which he drank, and forgot his passage over the burning sands–and the burning sands to which his passage must conduct him. He sat under the shade of the gourd, and forgot the worm was working at its root;–perhaps the undying worm that gnawed, and coiled, and festered in his own heart, might have made him forget the corrosions of that he himself had sown in hers.

'Isidora, before the second week of their interview, had lowered her pretensions. She had given up the hope to interest or to dazzle–that hope which is twin-born with love in the purest female heart. She now had concentrated all her hopes, and all her heart, no longer in the ambition to be beloved, but in the sole wish to love. She no longer alluded to the enlargement of her faculties, the acquisition of new powers, and the expansion and cultivation of her taste. She ceased to speak–she sought only to listen–then her wish subsided into that quiet listening for his form alone, which seemed to transfer the office of hearing into the eyes, or rather, to identify both. She saw him long before he appeared,–and heard him though he did not speak. They have been in each other's presence for the short hours of a Spanish summer's night,–Isidora's eyes alternately fixed on the sun-like moon, and on her mysterious lover,–while he, without uttering a word, leaned against the pillars of her balcony, or the trunk of the giant myrtle-tree, which cast the shade he loved, even by night, over his portentous expression,–and they never uttered a word to each other, till the waving of Isidora's hand, as the dawn appeared, was the tacit signal for their parting.

'This is the marked graduation of profound feeling. Language is no longer necessary to those whose beating hearts converse audibly–whose eyes, even by moonlight, are more intelligible to each other's stolen and shadowed glances, than the broad converse of face to face in the brightest sunshine–to whom, in the exquisite inversion of earthly feeling and habit, darkness is light, and silence eloquence.

'At their last interviews, Isidora sometimes spoke,–but it was only to remind her lover, in a soft and chastened tone, of a promise which it seems he had at one time made of disclosing himself to her parents, and demanding her at their hands. Something she murmured also of her declining health–her exhausted spirits–her breaking heart–the long delay–the hope deferred–the mysterious meeting; and while she spoke she wept, but hid her tears from him.

'It is thus, Oh God! we are doomed (and justly doomed when we fix our hearts on any thing below thee) to feel those hearts repelled like the dove who hovered over the shoreless ocean, and found not a spot where her foot might rest,–not a green leaf to bring back in her beak. Oh that the ark of mercy may open to such souls, and receive them from that stormy world of deluge and of wrath, with which they are unable to contend, and where they can find no resting-place!

'Isidora now had arrived at the last stage of that painful pilgrimage through which she had been led by a stern and reluctant guide.

'In its first, with the innocent and venial art of woman, she had tried to interest him by the display of her new acquirements, without the consciousness that they were not new to him. The harmony of civilized society, of which she was at once weary and proud, was discord to his ear. He had examined all the strings that formed this curious but ill-constructed instrument, and found them all false.

'In the second, she was satisfied with merely beholding him. His presence formed the atmosphere of her existence–in it alone she breathed. She said to herself, as evening approached, 'I shall see him!'–and the burden of life rolled from her heart as she internally uttered the words. The constraint, the gloom, the monotony of her existence, vanished like clouds at the sun, or rather like those clouds assuming such gorgeous and resplendent colours, that they seemed to have been painted by the finger of happiness itself. The brilliant hue diffused itself over every object of her eye and heart. Her mother appeared no longer a cold and gloomy bigot, and even her brother seemed kind. There was not a tree in the garden whose foliage was not illumined as by the light of a setting sun; and the breeze spoke to her in a voice whose melody was borrowed from her own heart.

'When at length she saw him,–when she said to herself, He is there,–she felt as if all the felicity of earth was comprised in that single sensation,–at least she felt that all her own was. She no longer indulged the wish to attract or to subdue him–absorbed in his existence, she forgot her own–immersed in the consciousness of her own felicity, she lost the wish, or rather the pride, of BESTOWING it. In the impassioned revelry of the heart, she flung the pearl of existence into the draught in which she pledged her lover, and saw it melt away without a sigh. But now she was beginning to feel, that for this intensity of feeling, this profound devotedness, she was entitled at least to an honourable acknowledgement on the part of her lover; and that the mysterious delay in which her existence was wasted, might make that acknowledgement come perhaps too late. She expressed this to him; but to these appeals, (not the least affecting of which had no language but that of looks), he replied only by a profound but uneasy silence, or by a levity whose wild and frightful sallies had something in them still more alarming.

'At times he appeared even to insult the heart over which he had triumphed, and to affect to doubt his conquest with the air of one who is revelling in its certainty, and who mocks the captive by asking 'if it is really in chains?'

'You do not love?' he would say;–'you cannot love me at least. Love, in your happy Christian country, must be the result of cultivated taste,–of harmonized habits,–of a felicitous congeniality of pursuits,–of thought, and hopes, and feelings, that, in the sublime language of the Jewish poet, (prophet I meant), 'tell and certify to each other; and though they have neither speech or language, a voice is heard among them.' You cannot love a being repulsive in his appearance,–eccentric in his habits,–wild and unsearchable in his feelings,–and inaccessible in the settled purpose of his fearful and fearless existence. No,' he added in a melancholy and decided tone of voice, 'you cannot love me under the circumstances of your new existence. Once–but that is past.–You are now a baptized daughter of the Catholic church,–the member of a civilized community,–the child of a family that knows not the stranger. What, then, is there between me and thee, Isidora, or, as your Fra Jose would phrase it, (if he knows so much Greek), '–'I loved you,' answered the Spanish maiden, speaking in the same pure, firm, and tender voice in which she had spoken when she first was the sole goddess of her fairy and flowery isle; 'I loved you before I was a Christian. They have changed my creed–but they never can change my heart. I love you still–I will be yours for ever! On the shore of the desolate isle,–from the grated window of my Christian prison,–I utter the same sounds. What can woman, what can man, in all the boasted superiority of his character and feeling, (which I have learned only since I became a Christian, or an European), do more? You but insult me when you appear to doubt that feeling, which you may wish to have analysed, because you do not experience or cannot comprehend it. Tell me, then, what is it to love? I defy all your eloquence, all your sophistry, to answer the question as truly as I can. If you would wish to know what is love, inquire not at the tongue of man, but at the heart of woman.'–'What is love?' said Melmoth; 'is that the question?'–'You doubt that I love,' said Isidora–'tell me, then, what is love?'–'You have imposed on me a task,' said Melmoth smiling, but not in mirth, 'so congenial to my feelings and habits of thought, that the execution will doubtless be inimitable. To love, beautiful Isidora, is to live in a world of the heart's own creation–all whose forms and colours are as brilliant as they are deceptive and unreal. To those who love there is neither day or night, summer or winter, society or solitude. They have but two eras in their delicious but visionary existence,–and those are thus marked in the heart's calendar–presence–absence. These are the substitutes for all the distinctions of nature and society. The world to them contains but one individual,–and that individual is to them the world as well as its single inmate. The atmosphere of his presence is the only air they can breathe in,–and the light of his eye the only sun of their creation, in whose rays they bask and live.'–'Then I love,' said Isidora internally. 'To love,' pursued Melmoth, 'is to live in an existence of perpetual contradictions–to feel that absence is insupportable, and yet be doomed to experience the presence of the object as almost equally so–to be full of ten thousand thoughts while he is absent, the confession of which we dream will render our next meeting delicious, yet when the hour of meeting arrives, to feel ourselves, by a timidity alike oppressive and unaccountable, robbed of the power of expressing one–to be eloquent in his absence, and dumb in his presence–to watch for the hour of his return as for the dawn of a new existence, yet when it arrives, to feel all those powers suspended which we imagined it would restore to energy–to be the statue that meets the sun, but without the music his presence should draw from it–to watch for the light of his looks, as a traveller in the deserts looks for the rising of the sun; and when it bursts on our awakened world, to sink fainting under its overwhelming and intolerable glory, and almost wish it were night again–this is love!'–'Then I believe I love,' said Isidora half audibly. 'To feel,' added Melmoth with increasing energy, 'that our existence is so absorbed in his, that we have lost all consciousness but of his presence–all sympathy but of his enjoyments–all sense of suffering but when he suffers–to be only because he is–and to have no other use of being but to devote it to him, while our humiliation increases in proportion to our devotedness; and the lower you bow before your idol, the prostrations seem less and less worthy of being the expression of your devotion,–till you are only his, when you are not yourself–To feel that to the sacrifice of yourself, all other sacrifices are inferior; and in it, therefore, all other sacrifices must be included. That she who loves, must remember no longer her individual existence, her natural existence–that she must consider parents, country, nature, society, religion itself–(you tremble, Immalee–Isidora I would say)–only as grains of incense flung on the altar of the heart, to burn and exhale their sacrificed odours there.'–'Then I do love,' said Isidora; and she wept and trembled indeed at this terrible confession–'for I have forgot the ties they told me were natural,–the country of which they said I was a native. I will renounce, if it must be so, parents,–country,–the habits which I have acquired,–the thoughts which I have learnt,–the religion which I–Oh no! my God! my Saviour!' she exclaimed, darting from the casement, and clinging to the crucifix–'No! I will never renounce you!–I will never renounce you!–you will not forsake me in the hour of death!–you will not desert me in the moment of trial!–you will not forsake me at this moment!'

'By the wax-lights that burned in her apartment, Melmoth could see her prostrate before the sacred image. He could see that devotion of the heart which made it throb almost visibly in the white and palpitating bosom–the clasped hands that seemed imploring aid against that rebellious heart, whose beatings they vainly struggled to repress; and then, locked and upraised, asked forgiveness from heaven for their fruitless opposition. He could see the wild but profound devotion with which she clung to the crucifix,–and he shuddered to behold it. He never gazed on that symbol,–his eyes were immediately averted;–yet now he looked long and intently at her as she knelt before it. He seemed to suspend the diabolical instinct that governed his existence, and to view her for the pure pleasure of sight. Her prostrate figure,–her rich robes that floated round her like drapery round an inviolate shrine,–her locks of light streaming over her naked shoulders,–her small white hands locked in agony of prayer,–the purity of expression that seemed to identify the agent with the employment, and made one believe they saw not a suppliant, but the embodied spirit of supplication, and feel, that lips like those had never held communion with aught below heaven.–All this Melmoth beheld; and feeling that in this he could never participate, he turned away his head in stern and bitter agony,–and the moon-beam that met his burning eye saw no tear there.

'Had he looked a moment longer, he might have beheld a change in the expression of Isidora too flattering to his pride, if not to his heart. He might have marked all that profound and perilous absorption of the soul, when it is determined to penetrate the mysteries of love or of religion, and chuse 'whom it will serve'–that pause on the brink of an abyss, in which all its energies, its passions, and its powers, are to be immersed–that pause, while the balance is trembling (and we tremble with it) between God and man.

'In a few moments, Isidora arose from before the cross. There was more composure, more elevation in her air. There was also that air of decision which an unreserved appeal to the Searcher of hearts never fails to communicate even to the weakest of those he has made.

'Melmoth, returning to his station beneath the casement, looked on her for some time with a mixture of compassion and wonder–feelings that he hasted to repel, as he eagerly demanded, 'What proof are you ready to give of that love I have described–of that which alone deserves the name?'–'Every proof,' answered Isidora firmly, 'that the most devoted of the daughters of man can give–my heart and hand,–my resolution to be yours amid mystery and grief,–to follow you in exile and loneliness (if it must be) through the world!'

'As she spoke, there was a light in her eye,–a glow on her brow,–an expansive and irradiated sublimity around her figure,–that made it appear like the rare and glorious vision of the personified union of passion and purity,–as if those eternal rivals had agreed to reconcile their claims, to meet on the confines of their respective dominions, and had selected the form of Isidora as the temple in which their league might be hallowed, and their union consummated–and never were the opposite divinities so deliciously lodged. They forgot their ancient feuds, and agreed to dwell there for ever.

'There was a grandeur, too, about her slender form, that seemed to announce that pride of purity,–that confidence in external weakness, and internal energy,–that conquest without armour,–that victory over the victor, which makes the latter blush at his triumph, and compels him to bow to the standard of the besieged fortress at the moment of its surrender. She stood like a woman devoted, but not humiliated by her devotion–uniting tenderness with magnanimity–willing to sacrifice every thing to her lover, but that which must lessen the value of the sacrifice in his eyes–willing to be the victim, but feeling worthy to be the priestess.

'Melmoth gazed on her as she stood. One generous, one human feeling, throbbed in his veins, and thrilled in his heart. He saw her in her beauty,–her devotedness,–her pure and perfect innocence,–her sole feeling for one who could not, by the fearful power of his unnatural existence, feel for mortal being. He turned aside, and did not weep; or if he did, wiped away his tears, as a fiend might do, with his burning talons, when he sees a new victim arrive for torture; and, repenting of his repentance, rends away the blot of compunction, and arms himself for his task of renewed infliction.

'Well, then, Isidora, you will give me no proof of your love? Is that what I must understand?'–'Demand,' answered the innocent and high-souled Isidora, 'any proof that woman ought to give–more is not in human power–less would render the proof of no value!'

'Such was the impression that these words made on Melmoth, whose heart, however, plunged in unutterable crimes, had never been polluted by sensuality, that he started from the spot where he stood,–gazed on her for a moment,–and then exclaimed, 'Well! you have given me proofs of love unquestionable! It remains for me to give you a proof of that love which I have described–of that love which only you could inspire–of that love which, under happier circumstances, I might–But no matter–it is not my business to analyse the feeling, but to give the proof.' He extended his arm toward the casement at which she stood.–'Would you then consent to unite your destiny with mine? Would you indeed be mine amid mystery and sorrow? Would you follow me from land to sea, and from sea to land,–a restless, homeless, devoted being,–with the brand on your brow, and the curse on your name? Would you indeed be mine?–my own–my only Immalee?'–'I would–I will!'–'Then,' answered Melmoth, 'on this spot receive the proof of my eternal gratitude. On this spot I renounce your sight!–I disannul your engagement!–I fly from you for ever!' And as he spoke, he disappeared.'





CHAPTER XXII



I'll not wed Paris,–Romeo is my husband.
 
SHAKESPEARE


'Isidora was so accustomed to the wild exclamations and (to her) unintelligible allusions of her mysterious lover, that she felt no unwonted alarm at his singular language, and abrupt departure. There was nothing in either more menacing or formidable than she had often witnessed; and she recollected, that after these paroxysms, he often re-appeared in a mood comparatively tranquil. She felt sustained, therefore, by this reflection,–and perhaps by that mysterious conviction impressed on the hearts of those who love profoundly–that passion must always be united with suffering; and she seemed to hear, with a kind of melancholy submission to the fatality of love, that her lot was to suffer from lips that were sure to verify the oracle. The disappearance, therefore, of Melmoth, gave her less surprise than a summons from her mother a few hours after, which was delivered in these words: 'Madonna Isidora, your lady-mother desires your presence in the tapestried chamber–having received intelligence by a certain express, which she deems fitting you should be acquainted withal.'

'Isidora had been in some degree prepared for extraordinary intelligence by an extraordinary bustle in this grave and quiet household. She had heard steps passing, and voices resounding, but



'She wist not what they were,'



and thought not of what they meant. She imagined that her mother might have some communication to make about some intricate point of conscience which Fra Jose had not discussed to her satisfaction, from which she would make an instant transition to the levity visible in the mode in which one attendant damsel arranged her hair, and the suspected sound of a ghitarra under the window of another, and then fly off at a tangent to inquire how the capons were fed, and why the eggs and Muscadine had not been duly prepared for Fra Jose's supper. Then would she fret about the family clock not chiming synchronically with the bells of the neighbouring church where she performed her devotions. And finally, she fretted about every thing, from the fattening of the 'pullen,' and the preparation for the olio, up to the increasing feuds between the Molinists and Jansenists, which had already visited Spain, and the deadly dispute between the Dominican and Franciscan orders, relative to the habit in which it was most effective to salvation for the dying body of the sinner to be wrapped. So between her kitchen and her oratory,–her prayers to the saints, and her scoldings to her servants,–her devotion and her anger,–Donna Clara continued to keep herself and domestics in a perpetual state of interesting occupation and gentle excitement.

'Something of this Isidora expected on the summons, and she was, therefore, surprised to see Donna Clara seated at her writing desk,–a large and fairly written manuscript of a letter extended before her,–and to hear words thereafter uttered thus: 'Daughter, I have sent for you, that you might with me partake of the pleasure these lines should afford both; and that you may do so, I desire you to sit and hear while they are read to you.'

'Donna Clara, as she uttered these words, was seated in a monstrous high-backed chair, of which she actually seemed a part, so wooden was her figure, so moveless her features, so lacklustre her eyes.

'Isidora curtsied low, and sat on one of the cushions with which the room was heaped,–while a spectacled duenna, enthroned on another cushion at the right hand of Donna Clara, read, with sundry pauses and some difficulty, the following letter, which Donna Clara had just received from her husband, who had landed, not at Ossuna,1 but at a real sea-port town in Spain, and was now on his way to join his family.



1 Vide Don Quixote, Vol. II. Smollet's Translation.



'DONNA CLARA,

'It is about a year since I received your letter advising me of the recovery of our daughter, whom we believed lost with her nurse on her voyage to India when an infant, to which I would sooner have replied, were I not otherwise hindered by concerns of business.

'I would have you understand, that I rejoice not so much that I have recovered a daughter, as that heaven hath regained a soul and a subject, as it were, e faucibus Draconis–e profundis Barathri–the which terms Fra Jose will make plain to your weaker comprehension.

'I trust that, through the ministry of that devout servant of God and the church, she is now become as complete a Catholic in all points necessary, absolute, doubtful, or incomprehensible,–formal, essential, venial, and indispensible, as becomes the daughter of an old Christian such as I (though unworthy of that honour) boast myself to be. Moreover, I expect to find her, as a Spanish maiden should be, equipped and accomplished with all the virtues pertaining to that character, especially those of discretion and reserve. The which qualities, as I have always perceived to reside in you, so I hope you have laboured to transfer to her,–a transfer by which the receiver is enriched, and the giver not impoverished.

'Finally, as maidens should be rewarded for their chastity and reserve by being joined in wedlock with a worthy husband, so it is the duty of a careful father to provide such a one for his daughter, that she do not pass her marriageable age, and sit in discontent and squalidness at home, as one overlooked of the other sex. My fatherly care, therefore, moving me, I shall bring with me one who is to be her husband, Don Gregorio Montilla, of whose qualifications I have not now leisure to speak, but whom I expect she will receive as becomes the dutiful daughter, and you as the obedient wife, of

FRANCISCO DI ALIAGA.'



'You have heard your father's letter, daughter,' said Donna Clara, placing herself as in act to speak, 'and doubtless sit silent in expectation of hearing from me a rehearsal of the duties pertaining to the state on which you are so soon to enter, and which, I take it, are three; that is to say, obedience, silence, and thriftiness. And first of the first, which, as I conceive, divides itself into thirteen heads,'–'Holy saints!' said the duenna under her breath, 'how pale Madonna Isidora grows!'–'First of the first,' continued Donna Clara, clearing her throat, elevating her spectacles with one hand, and fixing three demonstrative fingers of the other on a huge clasped volume, containing the life of St Francis Xavier, that lay on the desk before her,–'as touching the thirteen heads into which the first divides itself, the eleven first, I take it, are the most profitable–the two last I shall leave you to be instructed in by your husband. First, then,'–Here she was interrupted by a slight noise, which did not, however, draw her attention, till she was startled by a scream from the duenna, who exclaimed, 'The Virgin be my protection! Madonna Isidora has fainted!'

'Donna Clara lowered her spectacles, glanced at the figure of her daughter, who had fallen from her cushion, and lay breathless on the floor, and, after a short pause, replied, 'She has fainted. Raise her.–Call for assistance, and apply some cold water, or bear her into the open air. I fear I have lost the mark in the life of this holy saint,' muttered Donna Clara when alone; 'this comes of this foolish business of love and marriage. I never loved in my life, thank the saints!–and as to marriage, that is according to the will of God and of our parents.'

'The unfortunate Isidora was lifted from the floor, conveyed into the open air, whose breath had the same effect on her still elementary existence, that water was said to have on that of the ombre pez, (man-fish), of whom the popular traditions of Barcelona were at that time, and still have been, rife.

'She recovered; and sending an apology to Donna Clara for her sudden indisposition, intreated her attendants to leave her, as she wished to be alone. Alone!–that is a word to which those who love annex but one idea,–that of being in society with one who is their all. She wished in this (to her) terrible emergency, to ask counsel of him whose image was ever present to her, and whose voice she heard with the mind's ear distinctly even in absence.

'The crisis was indeed one calculated to try a female heart; and Isidora's, with its potency of feeling, opposed to utter destitution of judgment and of experience,–its native habits of resolution and self-direction, and its acquired ones of timidity and diffidence almost to despondency,–became the victim of emotions, whose struggle seemed at first to threaten her reason.

'Her former independent and instinctive existence revived in her heart at some moments, and suggested to her resolutions wild and desperate, but such as the most timid females have been known, under the pressure of a fearful exigency, to purpose, and even to execute. Then the constraint of her new habits,–the severity of her factitious existence,–and the solemn power of her newly-learned but deeply-felt religion,–made her renounce all thoughts of resistance or opposition, as offences against heaven.

'Her former feelings, her new duties, beat in terrible conflict against her heart; and, trembling at the isthmus on which she stood, she felt it, under the influence of opposing tides, narrowing every moment under her feet.

'This was a dreadful day to her. She had sufficient time for reflection, but she had within her the conviction that reflection could be of no use,–that the circumstances in which she was placed, not her own thoughts, must decide for her,–and that, situated as she was, mental power was no match for physical.

'There is not, perhaps, a more painful exercise of the mind than that of treading, with weary and impatient pace, the entire round of thought, and arriving at the same conclusion for ever; then setting out again with increased speed and diminished strength, and again returning to the very same spot–of sending out all our faculties on a voyage of discovery, and seeing them all return empty, and watch the wrecks as they drift helplessly along, and sink before the eye that hailed their outward expedition with joy and confidence.

'All that day she thought how it was possible to liberate herself from her situation, while the feeling that liberation was impossible clung to the bottom of her heart; and this sensation of the energies of the soul in all their strength, being in vain opposed to imbecillity and mediocrity, when aided by circumstances, is one productive alike of melancholy and of irritation. We feel, like prisoners in romance, bound by threads to which the power of magic has given the force of adamant.

'To those whose minds incline them rather to observe, than to sympathize with the varieties of human feeling, it would have been interesting to watch the restless agony of Isidora, contrasted with the cold and serene satisfaction of her mother, who employed the whole of the day in composing, with the assistance of Fra Jose, what Juvenal calls 'verbosa et grandis epistola,' in answer to that of her husband; and to conceive how two human beings, apparently of similarly-constructed organs, and destined apparently to sympathize with each other, could draw from the same fountain waters sweet and bitter.

'On her plea of continued indisposition, Isidora was excused from appearing before her mother during the remainder of the day. The night came on,–the night, which, by concealing the artificial objects and manners which surrounded her, restored to her, in some degree, the consciousness of her former existence, and gave her a sense of independence she never felt by day. The absence of Melmoth increased her anxiety. She began to apprehend that his departure was intended to be final, and her heart sunk at the thought.

'To the mere reader of romance, it may seem incredible that a female of Isidora's energy and devotedness should feel anxiety or terror in a situation so common to a heroine. She has only to stand proof against all the importunities and authority of her family, and announce her desperate resolution to share the destiny of a mysterious and unacknowledged lover. All this sounds very plausible and interesting. Romances have been written and read, whose interest arose from the noble and impossible defiance of the heroine to all powers human and superhuman alike. But neither the writers or readers seem ever to have taken into account the thousand petty external causes that operate on human agency with a force, if not more powerful, far more effective than the grand internal motive which makes so grand a figure in romance, and so rare and trivial a one in common life.

'Isidora would have died for him she loved. At the stake or the scaffold she would have avowed her passion, and triumphed in perishing as its victim. The mind can collect itself for one great effort, but it is exhausted by the eternally-recurring necessity of domestic conflicts,–victories by which she must lose, and defeats by which she might gain the praise of perseverance, and feel such gain was loss. The last single and terrible effort of the Jewish champion, in which he and his enemies perished together, must have been a luxury compared to his blind drudgery in his mill.

'Before Isidora lay that painful and perpetual struggle of fettered strength with persecuting weakness, which, if the truth were told, would divest half the heroines of romance of the power or wish to contend against the difficulties that beset them. Her mansion was a prison–she had no power (and if she possessed the power, would never have exercised it) of obtaining an unpermitted or unobserved egress from the doors of the house for one moment. Thus her escape was completely barred; and had every door in the house been thrown open, she would have felt like a bird on its first flight from the cage, without a spray that she dared to rest on. Such was her prospect, even if she could effect her escape–at home it was worse.

'The stern and cold tone of authority in which her father's letter was written, gave her but little hope that in her father she would find a friend. Then the feeble and yet imperious mediocrity of her mother–the selfish and arrogant temper of Fernan–the powerful influence and incessant documentising of Fra Jose, whose good-nature was no match for his love of authority–the daily domestic persecution–that vinegar that would wear out any rock–the being compelled to listen day after day to the same exhausting repetition of exhortation, chiding, reproach, and menace, or seek refuge in her chamber, to waste the weary hours in loneliness and tears–this strife maintained by one strong indeed in purpose, but feeble in power, against so many all sworn to work their will, and have their way–this perpetual conflict with evils so trivial in the items, but so heavy in the amount, to those who have the debt to pay daily and hourly,–was too much for the resolution of Isidora, and she wept in hopeless despondency, as she felt that already her courage shrunk from the encounter, and knew not what concessions might be extorted from her increasing inability of resistance.

'Oh!' she cried, clasping her hands in the extremity of her distress, 'Oh that he were but here to direct, to counsel me!–that he were here even no longer as my lover, but only as my adviser!'

'It is said that a certain power is always at hand to facilitate the wishes that the individual forms for his own injury; and so it should seem in the present instance,–for she had scarce uttered these words, when the shadow of Melmoth was seen darkening the garden walk,–and the next moment he was beneath the casement. As she saw him approach, she uttered a cry of mingled joy and fear, which he hushed by making a signal of silence with his hand, and then whispered, 'I know it all!'

'Isidora was silent. She had nothing but her recent distress to communicate,–and of that, it appeared, he was already apprized. She waited, therefore, in mute anxiety for some words of counsel or of comfort. 'I know all!' continued Melmoth; 'your father has landed in Spain–he brings with him your destined husband. The fixed purpose of your whole family, as obstinate as they are weak, it will be bootless in you to resist; and this day fortnight will see you the bride of Montilla.'–'I will first be the bride of the grave,' said Isidora, with perfect and fearful calmness.

'At these words, Melmoth advanced and gazed on her more closely. Any thing of intense and terrible resolution,–of feeling or action in extremity,–made harmony with the powerful but disordered chords of his soul. He required her to repeat the words–she did so, with quivering lip, but unfaultering voice. He advanced still nearer to gaze on her as she spoke. It was a beautiful and fearful sight to see her as she stood;–her marble face–her moveless features–her eyes in which burned the fixed and livid light of despair, like a lamp in a sepulchral vault–the lips that half opened, and remaining unclosed, appeared as if the speaker was unconscious of the words that had escaped them, or rather, as if they had burst forth by involuntary and incontroulable impulse;–so she stood, like a statue, at her casement, the moonlight giving her white drapery the appearance of stone, and her wrought-up and determined mind lending the same rigidity to her expression. Melmoth himself felt confounded–appalled he could not feel. He retreated, and then returning, demanded, 'Is this your resolution, Isidora?–and have you indeed resolution to'–'To die!' answered Isidora, with the same unaltered accent,–the same calm expression,–and seeming, as she spake, capable of all she expressed; and this union, in the same slight and tender form, of those eternal competitors, energy and fragility, beauty and death, made every human pulse in Melmoth's frame beat with a throbbing unknown before. 'Can you, then,' he said, with averted head, and in a tone that seemed ashamed of its own softness–'Can you, then, die for him you will not live for?'–'I have said I will die sooner than be the bride of Montilla,' answered Isidora. 'Of death I know nothing, nor do I know much of life–but I would rather perish, than be the perjured wife of the man I cannot love.'–'And why can you not love him?' said Melmoth, toying with the heart he held in his hand, like a mischievous boy with a bird, around whose leg he has fastened a string.–'Because I can love but one. You were the first human being I ever saw who could teach me language, and who taught me feeling. Your image is for ever before me, present or absent, sleeping or waking. I have seen fairer forms,–I have listened to softer voices,–I might have met gentler hearts,–but the first, the indelible image, is written on mine, and its characters will never be effaced till that heart is a clod of the valley. I loved you not for comeliness,–I loved you not for gay deportment, or fond language, or all that is said to be lovely in the eye of woman,–I loved you because you were my first,–the sole connecting link between the human world and my heart,–the being who brought me acquainted with that wondrous instrument that lay unknown and untouched within and me, whose chords, as long as they vibrate, will disdain to obey any touch but that of their first mover–because your image is mixed in my imagination with all the glories of nature–because your voice, when I heard it first, was something in accordance with the murmur of the ocean, and the music of the stars. And still its tones recal the unimaginable blessedness of those scenes where first I heard it,–and still I listen to it like an exile who hears the music of his native country in a land that is very far off,–because nature and passion, memory and hope, alike cling round your image; and amid the light of my former existence, and the gloom of my present, there is but one form that retains its reality and its power through light and shade. I am like one who has traversed many climates, and looks but to one sun as the light of all, whether bright or obscure. I have loved once–and for ever!' Then, trembling at the words she uttered, she added, with that sweet mixture of maiden pride and purity that redeems while it pledges the hostage of the heart, 'The feelings I have entrusted you with may be abused, but never alienated.'–'And these are your real feelings?' said Melmoth, pausing long, and moving his frame like one agitated by deep and uneasy thoughts. 'Real!' repeated Isidora, with some transient glow on her cheek–'real! Can I utter any thing but what is real? Can I so soon forget my existence?' Melmoth looked up once more as she spoke–'If such is your resolution,–if such be your feelings indeed,'–'And they are!–they are!' exclaimed Isidora, her tears bursting through the slender fingers, which, after extending towards him, she clasped over her burning eyes. 'Then look to the alternative that awaits you!' said Melmoth slowly, bringing out the words with difficulty, and, as it appeared, with some feeling for his victim; 'a union with the man who cannot love,–or the perpetual hostility, the wearying, wasting, almost annihilating persecution of your family! Think of days that'–'Oh let me not think!' cried Isidora, wringing her white and slender hands; 'tell me–tell me what may be done to escape them!'–'Now, in good troth,' answered Melmoth, knitting his brows with a most cogitative wrinkle, while it was impossible to discover whether his predominant expression was that of irony or profound and sincere feeling–'I know not what resource you have unless you wed me.'–'Wed you!' cried Isidora, retreating from the window–'Wed you!' and she clasped her hands over her pale forehead;–and at this moment, when the hope of her heart, the thread on which her existence was suspended, was within her reach, she trembled to touch it. 'Wed you!–but how is that possible?'–'All things are possible to those who love,' said Melmoth, with his sardonic smile, which was hid by the shades of the night. 'And you will wed me, then, by the rites of the church of which I am a member?'–'Aye! or of any other!'–'Oh speak not so wildly!–say not aye in that horrible voice! Will you wed me as a Christian maiden should be wed?–Will you love me as a Christian wife should be loved? My former existence was like a dream,–but now I am awake. If I unite my destiny to yours,–if I abandon my family, my country, my'–'If you do, how will you be the loser?–your family harasses and confines you–your country would shout to see you at the stake, for you have some heretical feelings about you, Isidora. And for the rest'–'God!' said the poor victim, clasping her hands, and looking upwards, 'God, aid me in this extremity!'–'If I am to wait here only as a witness to your devotions,' said Melmoth with sullen asperity, 'my stay will not be long.'–'You cannot leave me, then, to struggle with fear and perplexity alone!

'To-morrow night,' said Isidora, after a long pause, and in accents almost inarticulate. She closed the casement as she spoke, and Melmoth slowly departed.'

Gone to be married.–
 
SHAKESPEARE


'The whole of the next day was occupied by Donna Clara, to whom letter-writing was a rare, troublesome, and momentous task, in reading over and correcting her answer to her husband's letter; in which examination she found so much to correct, interline, alter, modify, expunge, and new-model, that finally Donna Clara's epistle very much resembled the work she was now employed in, namely, that of overcasting a piece of tapestry wrought by her grandmother, representing the meeting of king Solomon and the queen of Sheba. The new work, instead of repairing, made fearful havock among the old; but Donna Clara went on, like her countryman at Mr Peter's puppet-show, playing away (with her needle) in a perfect shower of back-strokes, forestrokes, side-thrusts, and counter-thrusts, till not a figure in the tapestry could know himself again. The faded face of Solomon was garnished with a florid beard of scarlet silk (which Fra Jose at first told her she must rip out, as it made Solomon very little better than Judas) that made him resemble a boiled scallop. The fardingale of the queen of Sheba was expanded to an enormous hoop, of whose shrunk and pallid wearer it might be truly said, 'Minima est pars sui. The dog that, in the original tapestry, stood by the spurred and booted heel of the oriental monarch, (who was clad in Spanish costume), by dint of a few tufts of black and yellow satin, was converted into a tiger,–a transformation which his grinning fangs rendered as authentic as heart could wish. And the parrot perched on the queen's shoulder, with the help of a train of green and gold, which the ignorant mistook for her majesty's mantle, proved a very passable peacock.

'As little trace of her original epistle did Donna Clara's present one bear, as did her elaborate overcasting to the original and painful labours of her grandmother. In both, however, Donna Clara (who scorned to flinch) went over the same ground with dim eye, and patient touch, and inextinguishable and remorseless assiduity. The letter, such as it was, was still sufficiently characteristic of the writer. Some passages of it the reader shall be indulged with,–and we reckon on his gratitude for not insisting on his perusal of the whole. The authentic copy, from which we are favoured with the extracts, runs thus.

* * * *

'Your daughter takes to her religion like mother's milk; and well may she do so, considering that the trunk of our family was planted in the genuine soil of the Catholic church, and that every branch of it must flourish there or perish. For a Neophyte, (as Fra Jose wills me to word it), she is as promising a sprout as one should wish to see flourishing within the pale of the holy church;–and for a heathen, she is so amenable, submissive, and of such maidenly suavity, that for the comportment of her person, and the discreet and virtuous ordering of her mind, I have no Christian mother to envy. Nay, I sometimes take pity on them, when I see the lightness, the exceeding vain carriage, and the unadvised eagerness to be wedded, of the best trained maidens of our country. This our daughter hath nothing of, either in her outward demeanour, or inward mind. She talks little, therefore she cannot think much; and she dreams not of the light devices of love, and is therefore well qualified for the marriage proposed unto her.

* * * *

'One thing, dear spouse of my soul, I would have thee to take notice of, and guard like the apple of thine eye,–our daughter is deranged, but never, on thy discretion, mention this to Don Montilla, even though he were the descendant in the right line of the Campeador, or of Gonsalvo di Cordova. Her derangement will in no wise impede or contravene her marriage,–for be it known to thee, it breaks out but at times, and at such times, that the most jealous eye of man could not spy it, unless he had a foretaught intimation of it. She hath strange fantasies swimming in her brain, such as, that heretics and heathens shall not be everlastingly damned–(God and the saints protect us!)–which must clearly proceed from madness,–but which her Catholic husband, if ever he comes to the knowledge of them, shall know how to expel, by aid of the church, and conjugal authority. That thou may'st better know the truth of what I hereby painfully certify, the saints and Fra Jose (who will not let me tell a lie, because he in a manner holds my pen) can witness, that about four days before we left Madrid, as we went to church, and I was about, while ascending the steps, to dole alms to a mendicant woman wrapt in a mantle, who held up a naked child for the receiving of charity, your daughter twitched my sleeve, while she whispered, 'Madam, she cannot be mother to that child, for she is covered, and her child is naked. If she were its mother, she would cover her child, and not be comfortably wrapt herself.' True it was, I found afterwards the wretched woman had hired the child from its more wretched mother, and my alms had paid the price of its hire for the day; but still that not a whit disproved our daughter insane, inasmuch as it showed her ignorant of the fashion and usages of the beggars of the country, and did in some degree shew a doubt of the merit of alms-deeds, which thou know'st none but heretics or madmen could deny. Other and grievous proofs of her insanity doth she give daily; but not willing to incumber you with ink, (which Fra Jose willeth me to call atramentum), I will add but a few particulars to arouse your dormant faculties, which may be wrapt in lethargic obliviousness by the anodyne of my somniferous epistolation.'

'Reverend Father,' said Donna Clara, looking up to Fra Jose, who had dictated the last line, 'Don Francisco will know the last line not to be mine–he heard it in one of your sermons. Let me add the extraordinary proof of my daughter's insanity at the ball.'–'Add or diminish, compose or confound, what you will, in God's name!' said Fra Jose, vexed at the frequent erazures and lituras which disfigured the lines of his dictation; 'for though in style I may somewhat boast of my superiority, in scratches no hen on the best dunghill in Spain can contend with you! On, then, in the name of all the saints!–and when it pleases heaven to send an interpreter to your husband, we may hope to hear from him by the next post-angel, for surely such a letter was never written on earth.'

'With this encouragement and applause, Donna Clara proceeded to relate sundry other errors and wanderings of her daughter, which, to a mind so swathed, crippled, and dwarfed, by the ligatures which the hand of custom had twined round it since its first hour of consciousness, might well have appeared like the aberrations of insanity. Among other proofs, she mentioned that Isidora's first introduction to a Christian and Catholic church, was on that night of penitence in passion-week, when, the lights being extinguished, the miserere is chaunted in profound darkness, the penitents macerate themselves, and groans are heard on every side instead of prayers, as if the worship of Moloch was renewed without its fires;–struck with horror at the sounds she heard, and the darkness which surrounded her, Isidora demanded what they were doing.–'Worshipping God,' was the answer.

'At the expiration of Lent, she was introduced to a brilliant assembly, where the gay fandango was succeeded by the soft notes of the seguedilla,–and the crackling of the castanets, and the tinkling of the guitars, marked alternate time to the light and ecstatic step of youth, and the silvery and love-tuned voice of beauty. Touched with delight at all she saw and heard,–the smiles that dimpled and sparkled over her beautiful features reflecting every shade of pleasure they encountered, like the ripplings of a brook kissed by the moon-beams,–she eagerly asked, 'And are not these worshipping God?'–'Out on it, daughter!' interposed Donna Clara, who happened to overhear the question; 'This is a vain and sinful pastime,–the invention of the devil to delude the children of folly,–hateful in the eyes of heaven and its saints,–and abhorred and renounced by the faithful.'–'Then there are two Gods,' said Isidora sighing, 'the God of smiles and happiness, and the God of groans and blood. Would I could serve the former!'–'I will take order you shall serve the latter, heathenish and profane that you are!' answered Donna Clara, as she hurried her from the assembly, shocked at the scandal which her words might have given. These and many similar anecdotes were painfully indited in Donna Clara's long epistle, which, after being folded and sealed by Fra Jose, (who swore by the habit he wore, he had rather study twenty pages of the Polyglot fasting, than read it over once more), was duly forwarded to Don Francisco.

'The habits and movements of Don Francisco were, like those of his nation, so deliberate and dilatory, and his aversion to writing letters, except on mercantile subjects, so well known, that Donna Clara was actually alarmed at receiving, in the evening of the day in which her epistle was dispatched, another letter from her husband.

'Its contents must be guessed to be sufficiently singular, when the result was, that Donna Clara and Fra Jose sat up over them nearly the whole of the night, in consultation, anxiety, and fear. So intense was their conference, that it is recorded it was never interrupted even by the lady telling her beads, or the monk thinking of his supper. All the artificial habits, the customary indulgences, the factitious existence of both, were merged in the real genuine fear which pervaded their minds, and which asserted its power over both in painful and exacting proportion to their long and hardy rejection of its influence. Their minds succumbed together, and sought and gave in vain, feeble counsel, and fruitless consolation. They read over and over again this extraordinary letter, and at every reading their minds grew darker,–and their counsels more perplexed,–and their looks more dismal. Ever and anon they turned their eyes on it, as it lay open before them on Donna Clara's ebony writing-desk, and then starting, asked each other by looks, and sometimes in words, 'Did either hear some strange noise in the house?' The letter, among other matter not important to the reader, contained the singular passage following.

* * * *

'In my travel from the place where I landed, to that whence I now write, I fortuned to be in company with strangers, from whom I heard things touching me (not as they meant, but as my fear interpreted them) in a point the most exquisite that can prick and wound the soul of a Christian father. These I shall discuss unto thee at thy more leisure. They are full of fearful matter, and such as may perchance require the aid of some churchman rightly to understand, and fully to fathom. Nevertheless this I can commend to thy discretion, that after I had parted from this strange conference, the reports of which I cannot by letter communicate to thee, I retired to my chamber full of sad and heavy thoughts, and being seated in my chair, pored over a tome containing legends of departed spirits, in nowise contradictive to the doctrine of the holy Catholic church, otherwise I would have crushed it with the sole of my foot into the fire that burned before me on the hearth, and spit on its cinders with the spittle of my mouth. Now, whether it was the company I fortuned to be into, (whose conversation must never be known but to thee only), or the book I had been reading, which contained certain extracts from Pliny, Artemidore, and others, full-filled with tales which I may not now recount, but which did relate altogether to the revivification of the departed, appearing in due accordance with our Catholic conceptions of Christian ghosts in purgatory, with their suitable accoutrements of chains and flames,–as thus Pliny writeth, 'Apparebat eidolon senex, macie et senie confectus,'–or finally, the weariness of my lonely journey, or other things I know not,–but feeling my mind ill-disposed for deeper converse with books or my own thoughts, and though oppressed by sleep, unwilling to retire to rest,–a mood which I and others have often experienced,–I took out thy letters from the desk in which I duly reposit them, and read over the description which thou didst send me of our daughter, upon the first intelligence of her being discovered in that accursed isle of heathenism,–and I do assure thee, the description of our daughter hath been written in such characters on the bosom to which she hath never been clasped, that it would defy the art of all the limners in Spain to paint it more effectually. So, thinking on those dark-blue eyes,–and those natural ringlets which will not obey their new mistress, art,–and that slender undulating shape,–and thinking it would soon be folded in my arms, and ask the blessing of a Christian father in Christian tones, I dozed as I sat in my chair; and my dreams taking part with my waking thoughts, I was a-dreamt that such a creature, so fair, so fond, so cherubic, sat beside me, and asked me blessing. As I bowed to give it, I nodded in my chair and awoke. Awoke I say, for what followed was as palpable to human sight as the furniture of my apartment, or any other tangible object. There was a female seated opposite me, clad in a Spanish dress, but her veil flowed down to her feet. She sat, and seemed to expect that I should bespeak her first. 'Damsel,' I said, 'what seekest thou?–or why art thou here?' The figure never raised its veil, nor motioned with hand or lip. Mine head was full of what I had heard and read of; and after making the sign of the cross, and uttering certain prayers, I approached that figure, and said, 'Damsel, what wantest thou?'–'A father,' said the form, raising its veil, and disclosing the identical features of my daughter Isidora, as described in thy numerous letters. Thou mayest well guess my consternation, which I might almost term fear, at the sight and words of this beautiful but strange and solemn figure. Nor was my perplexity and trouble diminished but increased, when the figure, rising and pointing to the door, through which she forthwith passed with a mysterious grace and incredible alacrity, uttered, in transitu, words like these:–'Save me!–save me!–lose not a moment, or I am lost!' And I swear to thee, wife, that while that figure sat or departed, I heard not the rustling of her garments, or the tread of her foot, or the sound of her respiration–only as she went out, there was a rushing sound as of a wind passing through the chamber,–and a mist seemed to hang on every object around me, which dispersed,–and I was conscious of heaving a deep sigh, as if a load had been removed from my breast. I sat thereafter for an hour pondering on what I had seen, and not knowing whether to term it a waking dream, or a dream-like waking. I am a mortal man, sensible of fear, and liable to error,–but I am also a Catholic Christian, and have ever been a hearty contemner of your tales of spectres and visions, excepting always when sanctioned by the authority of the holy church, and recorded in the lives of her saints and martyrs. Finding no end or fruit of these my heavy cogitations, I withdrew myself to bed, where I long lay tossing and sleepless, till at the approach of morning, just as I was falling into a deep sleep, I was awoke by a noise like that of a breeze waving my curtains. I started up, and drawing them, looked around me. There was a glimpse of day-light appearing through the window-shutters, but not sufficient to enable me to distinguish the objects in the room, were it not for the lamp that burned on the hearth, and whose light, though somewhat dim, was perfectly distinct. By it I discovered, near the door, a figure which my sight, rendered more acute by my terror, verified as the identical figure I had before beheld, who, waving its arm with a melancholy gesture, and uttering in a piteous voice these words, 'It is too late,' disappeared. As, I will own to thee, overcome with horror at this second visitation, I fell back on my pillow almost bereft of the use of my faculties, I remember the clock struck three.'

'As Donna Clara and the priest (on their tenth perusal of the letter) arrived at these words, the clock in the hall below struck three. 'That is a singular coincidence,' said Fra Jose. 'Do you think it nothing more, Father?' said Donna Clara, turning very pale. 'I know not,' said the priest; 'many have told credible stories of warnings permitted by our guardian saints, to be given even by the ministry of inanimate things. But to what purpose are we warned, when we know not the evil we are to shun?'–'Hush!–hark!' said Donna Clara, 'did you hear no noise?'–'None,' said Fra Jose listening, not without some appearance of perturbation–'None,' he added, in a more tranquil and assured voice, after a pause; 'and the noise which I did hear about two hours ago, was of short continuance, and has not been renewed.'–'What a flickering light these tapers give!' said Donna Clara, viewing them with eyes glassy and fixed with fear. 'The casements are open,' answered the priest. 'So they have been since we sat here,' returned Donna Clara; 'yet now see what a stream of air comes rushing against them! Holy God! they flare as if they would go out!'

'The priest, looking up at the tapers, observed the truth of what she said,–and at the same time perceived the tapestry near the door to be considerably agitated. 'There is a door open in some other direction,' said he, rising. 'You are not going to leave me, Father?' said Donna Clara, who sat in her chair paralyzed with terror, and unable to follow him but with her eyes.

'The Father Jose made no answer. He was now in the passage, where a circumstance which he observed had arrested all his attention,–the door of Isidora's apartment was open, and lights were burning in it. He entered it slowly at first, and gazed around, but its inmate was not there. He glanced his eye on the bed, but no human form had pressed it that night–it lay untouched and undisturbed. The casement next caught his eye, now glancing with the quickness of fear on every object. He approached it–it was wide open,–the casement that looked towards the garden. In his horror at this discovery, the good Father could not avoid uttering a cry that pierced the ears of Donna Clara, who, trembling and scarce able to make her way to the room, attempted to follow him in vain, and fell down in the passage. The priest raised and tried to assist her back to her own apartment. The wretched mother, when at last placed in her chair, neither fainted or wept; but with white and speechless lips, and a paralytic motion of her hand, tried to point towards her daughter's apartment, as if she wished to be conveyed there. 'It is too late,' said the priest, unconsciously using the ominous words quoted in the letter of Don Francisco.'

'That night was the one fixed on for the union of Isidora and Melmoth. She had retired early to her chamber, and sat at the casement watching for his approach for hours before she could probably expect it. It might be supposed that at this terrible crisis of her fate, she felt agitated by a thousand emotions,–that a soul susceptible like hers felt itself almost torn in pieces by the struggle,–but it was not so. When a mind strong by nature, but weakened by fettering circumstances, is driven to make one strong spring to free itself, it has no leisure to calculate the weight of its hindrances, or the width of its leap,–it sits with its chains heaped about it, thinking only of the bound that is to be its liberation–or–

'During the many hours that Isidora awaited the approach of this mysterious bridegroom, she felt nothing but the awful sense of that approach, and of the event that was to follow. So she sat at her casement, pale but resolute, and trusting in the extraordinary promise of Melmoth, that by whatever means he was enabled to visit her, by those she would be enabled to effect her escape, in spite of her well-guarded mansion, and vigilant household.

'It was near one (the hour at which Fra Jose, who was sitting in consultation with her mother over that melancholy letter, heard the noise alluded to in the preceding chapter) when Melmoth appeared in the garden, and, without uttering a word, threw up a ladder of ropes, which, in short and sullen whispers, he instructed her to fasten, and assisted her to descend. They hurried through the garden,–and Isidora, amid all the novelty of her feelings and situation, could not avoid testifying her surprise at the facility with which they passed through the well-secured garden gate.

'They were now in the open country,–a region far wilder to Isidora than the flowery paths of that untrodden isle, where she had no enemy. Now in every breeze she heard a menacing voice,–in the echoes of her own light steps she heard the sound of steps pursuing her.

'The night was very dark,–unlike the midsummer nights in that delicious climate. A blast sometimes cold, sometimes stifling from heat, indicated some extraordinary vicissitude in the atmosphere. There is something very fearful in this kind of wintry feeling in a summer night. The cold, the darkness, followed by intense heat, and a pale, meteoric lightning, seemed to unite the mingled evils of the various seasons, and to trace their sad analogy to life,–whose stormy summer allows youth little to enjoy, and whose chilling winter leaves age nothing to hope.

'To Isidora, whose sensibilities were still so acutely physical, that she could feel the state of the elements as if they were the oracles of nature, which she could interpret at sight,–this dark and troubled appearance seemed like a fearful omen. More than once she paused, trembled, and turned on Melmoth a glance of doubt and terror,–which the darkness of the night, of course, prevented him from observing. Perhaps there was another cause,–but as they hurried on, Isidora's strength and courage began to fail together. She perceived that she was borne on with a kind of supernatural velocity,–her breath failed,–her feet faultered,–and she felt like one in a dream.

'Stay!' she exclaimed, gasping from weakness, 'stay!–whither am I going?–where do you bear me?'–'To your nuptials,' answered Melmoth, in low and almost inarticulate tones;–but whether rendered so by emotion, or by the speed with which they seemed to fly along, Isidora could not discover.

'In a few moments, she was forced to declare herself unable to proceed, and leaned on his arm, gasping and exhausted. 'Let me pause,' said she ominously, 'in the name of God!' Melmoth returned no answer. He paused, however, and supported her with an appearance of anxiety, if not of tenderness.

'During this interval, she gazed around her, and tried to distinguish the objects near; but the intense darkness of the night rendered this almost impossible,–and what she could discover, was not calculated to dispel her alarm. They seemed to be walking on a narrow and precipitous path close by a shallow stream, as she could guess, by the hoarse and rugged sound of its waters, as they fought with every pebble to win their way. This path was edged on the other side by a few trees, whose stunted growth, and branches tossing wild and wide to the blast that now began to whisper mournfully among them, seemed to banish every image of a summer night from the senses, and almost from the memory. Every thing around was alike dreary and strange to Isidora, who had never, since her arrival at the villa, wandered beyond the precincts of the garden,–and who, even if she had, would probably have found no clue to direct her where she now was. 'This is a fearful night,' said she, half internally. She then repeated the same words more audibly, perhaps in hope of some answering and consolatory sounds. Melmoth was silent–and her spirits subdued by fatigue and emotion, she wept. 'Do you already repent the step you have taken?' said he, laying a strange emphasis on the word–already. 'No, love, no!' replied Isidora, gently wiping away her tears; 'it is impossible for me ever to repent it. But this loneliness,–this darkness,–this speed,–this silence,–have in them something almost awful. I feel as if I were traversing some unknown region. Are these indeed the winds of heaven that sigh around me? Are these trees of nature's growth, that nod at me like spectres? How hollow and dismal is the sound of the blast!–it chills me though the night is sultry!–and those trees, they cast their shadows over my soul! Oh, is this like a bridal night?' she exclaimed, as Melmoth, apparently disturbed at these words, attempted to hurry her on–'Is this like a bridal? No father, no brother, to support me!–no mother near me!–no kiss of kindred to greet me!–no congratulating friends!'–and her fears increasing, she wildly exclaimed, 'Where is the priest to bless our union?–where is the church under whose roof we are to be united?'

'As she spoke, Melmoth, drawing her arm under his, attempted to lead her gently forward. 'There is,' said he, 'a ruined monastery near–you may have observed it from your window.'–'No! I never saw it. Why is it in ruins?'–'I know not–there were wild stories told. It was said the Superior, or Prior, or–I know not what–had looked into certain books, the perusal of which was not altogether sanctioned by the rules of his order–books of magic they called them. There was much noise about it, I remember, and some talk of the Inquisition,–but the end of the business was, the Prior disappeared, some said into the prisons of the Inquisition, some said into safer custody–(though how that could be, I cannot well conceive)–and the brethren were drafted into other communities, and the building became deserted. There were some offers made for it by the communities of other religious houses, but the evil, though vague and wild reports, that had gone forth about it, deterred them, on inquiry, from inhabiting it,–and gradually the building fell to ruin. It still retains all that can sanctify it in the eyes of the faithful. There are crucifixes and tomb-stones, and here and there a cross set up where there has been murder,–for, by a singular congeniality of taste, a banditti has fixed their seat there now,–and the traffic of gold for souls, once carried on so profitably by the former inmates, is exchanged for that of souls for gold, by the present.'

'At these words, Melmoth felt the slender arm that hung on his withdrawn,–and he perceived that his victim, between shuddering and struggling, had shrunk from his hold. 'But there,' he added, 'even amid those ruins, there dwells a holy hermit,–one who has taken up his residence near the spot,–he will unite us in his oratory, according to the rites of your church. He will speak the blessing over us,–and one of us, at least, shall be blessed.'–'Hold!' said Isidora, repelling, and standing at what distance from him she could,–her slight figure expanding to that queen-like dignity with which nature had once invested her as the fair and sole sovereign of her own island-paradise. 'Hold!' she repeated–'approach me not by another step,–address me not by another word,–till you tell me when and where I am to be united to you,–to become your wedded wife! I have borne much of doubt and terror,–of suspicion and persecution,–but'–'Hear me, Isidora,' said Melmoth, terrified at this sudden burst of resolution. 'Hear me,' answered the timid but heroic girl, springing, with the elasticity of her early movements, upon a crag that hung over their stony path, and clinging to an ash-tree that had burst through its fissures–'Hear me! Sooner will you rend this tree from its bed of stone, than me from its trunk! Sooner will I dash this body on the stony bed of the stream that groans below my feet, than descend into your arms, till you swear to me they will bear me to honour and safety! For you I have given up all that my newly-taught duties have told me was holy!–all that my heart long ago whispered I ought to love! Judge by what I have sacrificed, of what I can sacrifice–and doubt not that I would be my own victim ten thousand times sooner than yours!'–'By all that you deem holy!' cried Melmoth, humbling himself even to kneel before her as she stood,–'my intentions are as pure as your own soul!–the hermitage is not an hundred paces off. Come, and do not, by a fantastic and causeless apprehension, frustrate all the magnanimity and tenderness you have hitherto shewed, and which have raised you in my eyes not only above your sex, but above your whole species. Had you not been what you are, and what no other but you could be, you had never been the bride of Melmoth. With whom but you did he ever seek to unite his dark and inscrutable destiny? Isidora,' he added, in tones more potent and emphatic, perceiving she still hesitated, and clung to the tree–'Isidora, how weak, how unworthy of you is this! You are in my power,–absolutely, hopelessly in my power. No human eye can see me–no human arm can aid you. You are as helpless as infancy in my grasp. This dark stream would tell no tales of deeds that stained its waters,–and the blast that howls round you would never waft your groans to mortal ear! You are in my power, yet I seek not to abuse it. I offer you my hand to conduct you to a consecrated building, where we shall be united according to the fashion of your country–and will you still persevere in this fanciful and profitless waywardness?'

'As he spoke, Isidora looked round her helplessly–every object was a confirmation of his arguments–she shuddered and submitted. But as they walked on in silence, she could not help interrupting it to give utterance to the thousand anxieties that oppressed her heart.

'But you speak,' said she, in a suppressed and pleading tone,–'you speak of religion in words that make me tremble–you speak of it as the fashion of a country,–as a thing of form, of accident, of habit. What faith do you profess?–what church do you frequent?–what holy rites do you perform?'–'I venerate all faiths–alike, I hold all religious rites–pretty much in the same respect,' said Melmoth, while his former wild and scoffing levity seemed to struggle vainly with a feeling of involuntary horror. 'And do you then, indeed, believe in holy things?' asked Isidora. 'Do you indeed?' she repeated anxiously. 'I believe in a God,' answered Melmoth, in a voice that froze her blood; 'you have heard of those who believe and tremble,–such is he who speaks to you!'

'Isidora's acquaintance with the book from which he quoted, was too limited to permit her to understand the allusion. She knew, according to the religious education she had received, more of her breviary than her Bible; and though she pursued her inquiry in a timid and anxious tone, she felt no additional terror from words she did not understand.

'But,' she continued, 'Christianity is something more than belief in a God. Do you also believe in all that the Catholic church declares to be essential to salvation? Do you believe that'–And here she added a name too sacred, and accompanied with terms too awful, to be expressed in pages so light as these.1 'I believe it all–I know it all,' answered Melmoth, in a voice of stern and reluctant confession. 'Infidel and scoffer as I may appear to you, there is no martyr of the Christian church, who in other times blazed for his God, that has borne or exhibited a more resplendent illustration of his faith, than I shall bear one day–and for ever. There is a slight difference only between our testimonies in point of duration. They burned for the truths they loved for a few moments–not so many perchance. Some were suffocated before the flames could reach them,–but I am doomed to bear my attestation on the truth of the gospel, amid fires that shall burn for ever and ever. See with what a glorious destiny yours, my bride, is united! You, as a Christian, would doubtless exult to see your husband at the stake,–and amid the faggots to prove his devotion. How it must ennoble the sacrifice to think that it is to last to eternity!'



1 Here Monçada expressed his surprise at this passage, (as savouring more of Christianity than Judaism), considering it occurred in the manuscript of a Jew.



'Melmoth uttered these words in ears that heard no longer. Isidora had fainted; and hanging with one cold hand on his arm still, fell a helpless, senseless weight on the earth. Melmoth, at this sight, shewed more feeling than he could have been suspected of. He disentangled her from the folds of her mantle, sprinkled water from the stream on her cold cheek, and supported her frame in every direction where a breath of air was to be caught. Isidora recovered; for her swoon was that of fatigue more than fear; and, with her recovery, her lover's short-lived tenderness seemed to cease. The moment she was able to speak he urged her to proceed,–and while she feebly attempted to obey him, he assured her, her strength was perfectly recovered, and that the place they had to reach was but a few paces distant. Isidora struggled on. Their path now lay up the ascent of a steep hill,–they left the murmur of the stream, and the sighing of trees, behind them,–the wind, too, had sunk, but the night continued intensely dark,–and the absence of all sound seemed to Isidora to increase the desolateness of the scene. She wished for something to listen to beside her impeded and painful respiration, and the audible beatings of her heart. As they descended the hill on the other side, the murmuring of the waters became once more faintly audible; and this sound she had longed to hear again, had now, amid the stillness of the night, a cadence so melancholy, that she almost wished it hushed.

'Thus always, to the unhappy, the very fulfilment of their morbid wishings becomes a source of disappointment, and the change they hoped for is desirable only as it gives them cause to long for another change. In the morning they say, Would to God it were evening!–Evening comes,–and in the evening they say, Would to God it were morning! But Isidora had no time to analyse her feelings,–a new apprehension struck her,–and, as she could well guess from the increasing speed of Melmoth, and head thrown backward impatiently, and often, it had probably reached him too. A sound they had been for some time watching, (without communicating their feelings to each other), became every moment more distinct. It was the sound of a human foot, evidently pursuing them, from the increasing quickness of its speed, and a certain sharpness of tread, that irresistibly gave the idea of hot and anxious pursuit. Melmoth suddenly paused, and Isidora hung trembling on his arm. Neither of them uttered a word; but Isidora's eyes, instinctively following the slight but fearful waving of his arm, saw it directed towards a figure so obscure, that it at first appeared like a spray moving in the misty night,–then was lost in darkness as it descended the hill,–and then appeared in a human form, as far as the darkness of the night would permit its shape to be distinguishable. It came on–its steps were more and more audible, and its shape almost distinct.–Then Melmoth suddenly quitted Isidora, who, shivering with terror, but unable to utter a word that might implore him to stay, stood alone, her whole frame trembling almost to dissolution, and her feet feeling as if she were nailed to the spot where she stood. What passed she knew not. There was a short and darkened struggle between two figures,–and, in this fearful interval, she imagined she heard the voice of an ancient domestic, much attached to her, call on her, first in accents of expostulation and appeal, then in choaked and breathless cries for help–help–help!–Then she heard a sound as if a heavy body fell into the water that murmured below.–It fell heavily–the wave groaned–the dark hill groaned in answer, like murderers exchanging their stilled and midnight whispers over their work of blood–and all was silent. Isidora clasped her cold and convulsed fingers over her eyes, till a whispering voice, the voice of Melmoth, uttered, 'Let us hasten on, my love.'–'Where?' said Isidora, not knowing the meaning of the words she uttered.–'To the ruined monastery, my love,–to the hermitage, where the holy man, the man of your faith, shall unite us.'–'Where are the steps that pursued us?' said Isidora, suddenly recovering her recollection.–'They will pursue you no more.'–'But I saw a figure.'–'But you will see it no more.'–'I heard something fall into that stream–heavily–like a corse.'–'There was a stone that fell from the precipice of the hill–the waters splashed, and curled, and whitened round it for a moment, but they have swallowed it now, and appear to have such a relish for the morsel, that they will not be apt to resign it.'

'In silent horror she proceeded, till Melmoth, pointing to a dusky and indefinite mass of what, in the gloom of night, bore, according to the eye or the fancy, the shape of a rock, a tuft of trees, or a massive and unlighted building, whispered, 'There is the ruin, and near it stands the hermitage,–one moment more of effort,–of renewed strength and courage, and we are there.' Urged by these words, and still more by an undefinable wish to put an end to this shadowy journey,–these mysterious fears,–even at the risk of finding them worse than verified at its termination, Isidora exerted all her remaining strength, and, supported by Melmoth, began to ascend the sloping ground on which the monastery had once stood. There had been a path, but it was now all obstructed by stones, and rugged with the knotted and interlaced roots of the neglected trees that had once formed its shelter and its grace.

'As they approached, in spite of the darkness of the night, the ruin began to assume a distinct and characteristic appearance, and Isidora's heart beat less fearfully, when she could ascertain, from the remains of the tower and spire, the vast Eastern window, and the crosses still visible on every ruined pinnacle and pediment, like religion triumphant amid grief and decay, that this had been a building destined for sacred purposes. A narrow path, that seemed to wind round the edifice, conducted them to a front which overlooked an extensive cemetery, at the extremity of which Melmoth pointed out to her an indistinct object, which he said was the hermitage, and to which he would hasten to intreat the hermit, who was also a priest, to unite them. 'May I not accompany you?' said Isidora, glancing round on the graves that were to be her companions in solitude.–'It is against his vow,' said Melmoth, 'to admit a female into his presence, except when obliged by the course of his duties.' So saying he hasted away, and Isidora, sinking on a grave for rest, wrapt her veil around her, as if its folds could exclude even thought. In a few moments, gasping for air, she withdrew it; but as her eye encountered only tomb-stones and crosses, and that dark and sepulchral vegetation that loves to shoot its roots, and trail its unlovely verdure amid the joints of grave-stones, she closed it again, and sat shuddering and alone. Suddenly a faint sound, like the murmur of a breeze, reached her,–she looked up, but the wind had sunk, and the night was perfectly calm. The same sound recurring, as of a breeze sweeping past, made her turn her eyes in the direction from which it came, and, at some distance from her, she thought she beheld a human figure moving slowly along on the verge of the inclosure of the burial-ground. Though it did not seem approaching her, (but rather moving in a low circuit on the verge of her view), conceiving it must be Melmoth, she rose in expectation of his advancing to her, and, at this moment, the figure, turning and half-pausing, seemed to extend its arm towards her, and wave it once or twice, but whether with a motion or purpose of warning or repelling her, it was impossible to discover,–it then renewed its dim and silent progress, and the next moment the ruins hid it from her view. She had no time to muse on this singular appearance, for Melmoth was now at her side urging her to proceed. There was a chapel, he told her, attached to the ruins, but not like them in decay, where sacred ceremonies were still performed, and where the priest had promised to join them in a few moments. 'He is there before us,' said Isidora, adverting to the figure she had seen; 'I think I saw him.'–'Saw whom?' said Melmoth, starting, and standing immoveable till his question was answered.–'I saw a figure,' said Isidora, trembling–'I thought I saw a figure moving towards the ruin.'–'You are mistaken,' said Melmoth; but a moment after he added, 'We ought to have been there before him.' And he hurried on with Isidora. Suddenly slackening his speed, he demanded, in a choaked and indistinct voice, if she had ever heard any music precede his visits to her,–any sounds in the air. 'Never,' was the answer.–'You are sure?'–'Perfectly sure.'

'At this moment they were ascending the fractured and rugged steps that led to the entrance of the chapel, now they passed under the dark and ivied porch,–now they entered the chapel, which, even in darkness, appeared to the eyes of Isidora ruinous and deserted. 'He has not yet arrived,' said Melmoth, in a disturbed voice; 'Wait there a moment.' And Isidora, enfeebled by terror beyond the power of resistance, or even intreaty, saw him depart without an effort to detain him. She felt as if the effort would be hopeless. Left thus alone, she glanced her eyes around, and a faint and watery moon-beam breaking at that moment through the heavy clouds, threw its light on the objects around her. There was a window, but the stained glass of its compartments, broken and discoloured, held rare and precarious place between the fluted shafts of stone. Ivy and moss darkened the fragments of glass, and clung round the clustered pillars. Beneath were the remains of an altar and crucifix, but they seemed like the rude work of the first hands that had ever been employed on such subjects. There was also a marble vessel, that seemed designed to contain holy water, but it was empty,–and there was a stone bench, on which Isidora sunk down in weariness, but without hope of rest. Once or twice she looked up to the window, through which the moon-beams fell, with that instinctive feeling of her former existence, that made companions of the elements, and of the beautiful and glorious family of heaven, under whose burning light she had once imagined the moon was her parent, and the stars her kindred. She gazed on the window still, like one who loved the light of nature, and drank health and truth from its beams, till a figure passing slowly but visibly before the pillared shafts, disclosed to her view the face of that ancient servant, whose features she remembered well. He seemed to regard her with a look, first of intent contemplation,–then of compassion,–the figure then passed from before the ruined window, and a faint and wailing cry rung in the ears of Isidora as it disappeared.

'At that moment the moon, that had so faintly lit the chapel, sunk behind a cloud, and every thing was enveloped in darkness so profound, that Isidora did not recognize the figure of Melmoth till her hand was clasped in his, and his voice whispered, 'He is here–ready to unite us.' The long-protracted terrors of this bridal left her not a breath to utter a word withal, and she leaned on the arm that she felt, not in confidence, but for support. The place, the hour, the objects, all were hid in darkness. She heard a faint rustling as of the approach of another person,–she tried to catch certain words, but she knew not what they were,–she attempted also to speak, but she knew not what she said. All was mist and darkness with her,–she knew not what was muttered,–she felt not that the hand of Melmoth grasped hers,–but she felt that the hand that united them, and clasped their palms within his own, was as cold as that of death.'

HOMER


'We have now to retrace a short period of our narrative to the night on which Don Francisco di Aliaga, the father of Isidora, 'fortuned,' as he termed it, to be among the company whose conversation had produced so extraordinary an effect on him.

'He was journeying homewards, full of the contemplation of his wealth,–the certainty of having attained complete security against the evils that harass life,–and being able to set at defiance all external causes of infelicity. He felt like a man 'at ease in his possessions,'–and he felt also a grave and placid satisfaction at the thought of meeting a family who looked up to him with profound respect as the author of their fortunes,–of walking in his own house, amid bowing domestics and obsequious relatives, with the same slow authoritative step with which he paced the mart among wealthy merchants, and saw the wealthiest bow as he approached,–and when he had passed, point out the man of whose grave salute they were proud, and whisper, That is Aliaga the rich.–So thinking and feeling, as most prosperous men do, with an honest pride in their worldly success,–an exaggerated expectation of the homage of society,–(which they often find frustrated by its contempt),–and an ultimate reliance on the respect and devotion of their family whom they have enriched, making them ample amends for the slights they may be exposed to where their wealth is unknown, and their newly assumed consequence unappreciated,–or if appreciated, not valued:–So thinking and feeling, Don Francisco journeyed homeward.

'At a wretched inn where he was compelled to halt, he found the accommodation so bad, and the heat of the weather so intolerable in the low, narrow, and unwindowed rooms, that he preferred taking his supper in the open air, on a stone bench at the door of the inn. We cannot say that he there imagined himself to be feasted with trout and white bread, like Don Quixote,–and still less that he fancied he was ministered unto by damsels of rank;–on the contrary, Don Francisco was digesting a sorry meal with wretched wine, with a perfect internal consciousness of the mediocrity of both, when he beheld a person ride by, who paused, and looked as if he was inclined to stop at the inn. (The interval of this pause was not long enough to permit Don Francisco to observe particularly the figure or face of the horseman, or indeed to recognize him on any future occasion of meeting; nor was there any thing remarkable in his appearance to invite or arrest observation.) He made a sign to the host, who approached him with a slow and unwilling pace,–appeared to answer all his inquiries with sturdy negatives,–and finally, as the stranger rode on, returned to his station, crossing himself with every mark of terror and deprecation.

'There was something more in this than the ordinary surliness of a Spanish innkeeper. Don Francisco's curiosity was excited, and he asked the innkeeper, whether the stranger had proposed to pass the night at the inn, as the weather seemed to threaten a storm? 'I know not what he proposes,' answered the man, 'but this I know, that I would not suffer him to pass an hour under my roof for the revenues of Toledo. If there be a storm coming on, I care not–those who can raise them are the fittest to meet them!'

'Don Francisco inquired the cause of these extraordinary expressions of aversion and terror, but the innkeeper shook his head and remained silent, with, as it were, the circumspective fear of one who is inclosed within a sorcerer's circle, and dreads to pass its verge, lest he become the prey of the spirits who are waiting beyond it to take advantage of his transgression.

'At last, at Don Francisco's repeated instances, he said, 'Your worship must needs be a stranger in this part of Spain not to have heard of Melmoth the wanderer.'–'I have never heard of the name before,' said Don Francisco; 'and I conjure you, brother, to tell me what you know of this person, whose character, if I may judge by the manner in which you speak of him, must have in it something extraordinary.'–'Senhor,' answered the man, 'were I to relate what is told of that person, I should not be able to close an eye to-night; or if I did, it would be to dream of things so horrible, that I had rather lie awake for ever. But, if I am not mistaken, there is in the house one who can gratify your curiosity–it is a gentleman who is preparing for the press a collection of facts relative to that person, and who has been, for some time, in vain soliciting for a license to print them, they being such as the government, in its wisdom, thinks not fit to be perused by the eyes of Catholics, or circulated among a Christian community.'

'As the innkeeper spoke, and spoke with an earnestness that at least made the hearer believe he felt the conviction he tried to impress, the person of whom he spoke was standing beside Don Francisco. He had apparently overheard their conversation, and seemed not indisposed to continue it. He was a man of a grave and composed aspect, and altogether so remote from any appearance of imposition, or theatrical and conjuror-like display, that Don Francisco, grave, suspicious, and deliberate as a Spaniard, and moreover a Spanish merchant, may be, could not avoid giving him his confidence at sight, though he forbore any external expression of it.

'Senhor,' said the stranger, 'mine host has told you but the truth. The person whom you saw ride by, is one of those beings after whom human curiosity pants in vain,–whose life is doomed to be recorded in incredible legends that moulder in the libraries of the curious, and to be disbelieved and scorned even by those who exhaust sums on their collection, and ungratefully depreciate the contents of the volumes on whose aggregate its value depends. There has been, however, I believe, no other instance of a person still alive, and apparently exercising all the functions of a human agent, who has become already the subject of written memoirs, and the theme of traditional history. Several circumstances relating to this extraordinary being are even now in the hands of curious and eager collectors; and I have myself attained to the knowledge of one or two that are not among the least extraordinary. The marvellous period of life said to be assigned him, and the facility with which he has been observed to pass from region to region, (knowing all, and known to none), have been the principal causes why the adventures in which he is engaged, should be at once so numerous and so similar.'

'As the stranger ceased to speak, the evening grew dark, and a few large and heavy drops of rain fell. 'This night threatens a storm,' said the stranger, looking abroad with some degree of anxiety–'we had better retire within doors; and if you, Senhor, are not otherwise occupied, I am willing to pass away some hours of this unpleasant night in relating to you some circumstances relating to the wanderer, which have come within my certain knowledge.'

'Don Francisco assented to this proposal as much from curiosity, as from the impatience of solitude, which is never more insupportable than in an inn, and during stormy weather. Don Montilla, too, had left him on a visit to his father, who was in a declining state, and was not to join him again till his arrival in the neighbourhood of Madrid. He therefore bid his servants shew the way to his apartment, whither he courteously invited his new acquaintance.

'Imagine them now seated in the wretched upper apartment of a Spanish inn, whose appearance, though dreary and comfortless, had in it, nevertheless, something picturesque, and not inappropriate, as the scene where a wild and wondrous tale was to be related and listened to. There was no luxury of inventive art to flatter the senses, or enervate the attention,–to enable the hearer to break the spell that binds him to the world of horrors, and recover to all the soothing realities and comforts of ordinary life, like one who starts from a dream of the rack, and finds himself waking on a bed of down. The walls were bare, and the roofs were raftered, and the only furniture was a table, beside which Don Francisco and his companion sat, the one on a huge high-backed chair, the other on a stool so low, that he seemed seated at the listener's foot. A lamp stood on the table, whose light flickering in the wind, that sighed through many apertures of the jarring door, fell alternately on lips that quivered as they read, and cheeks that grew paler as the listener bent to catch the sounds to which fear gave a more broken and hollow tone, at the close of every page. The rising voice of the stormy night seemed to make wild and dreary harmony with the tones of the listener's feelings. The storm came on, not with sudden violence, but with sullen and long-suspended wrath–often receding, as it were, to the verge of the horizon, and then returning and rolling its deepening and awful peals over the very roof. And as the stranger proceeded in his narrative, every pause, which emotion or weariness might cause, was meetly filled by the deep rushing of the rain that fell in torrents,–the sighs of the wind,–and now and then a faint, distant, but long-continued peal of thunder. 'It sounds,' said the stranger, raising his eyes from the manuscript, 'like the chidings of the spirits, that their secrets are disclosed!'

The Tale of Guzman's Family



'Of what I am about to read to you,' said the stranger, 'I have witnessed part myself, and the remainder is established on a basis as strong as human evidence can make it.

'In the city of Seville, where I lived many years, I knew a wealthy merchant, far advanced in years, who was known by the name of Guzman the rich. He was of obscure birth,–and those who honoured his wealth sufficiently to borrow from him frequently, never honoured his name so far as to prefix Don to it, or to add his surname, of which, indeed, most were ignorant, and among the number, it is said, the wealthy merchant himself. He was well respected, however; and when Guzman was seen, as regularly as the bell tolled for vespers, to issue from the narrow door of his house,–lock it carefully,–view it twice or thrice with a wistful eye,–then deposit the key in his bosom, and move slowly to church, feeling for the key in his vest the whole way,–the proudest heads in Seville were uncovered as he passed,–and the children who were playing in the streets, desisted from their sports till he had halted by them.

'Guzman had neither wife or child,–relative or friend. An old female domestic constituted his whole household, and his personal expences were calculated on a scale of the most pinching frugality; it was therefore matter of anxious conjecture to many, how his enormous wealth would be bestowed after his death. This anxiety gave rise to inquiries about the possibility of Guzman having relatives, though in remoteness and obscurity; and the diligence of inquiry, when stimulated at once by avarice and curiosity, is indefatigable. Thus it was at length discovered that Guzman had formerly a sister, many years younger than himself, who, at a very early age, had married a German musician, a Protestant, and had shortly after quitted Spain. It was remembered, or reported, that she had made many efforts to soften the heart and open the hand of her brother, who was even then very wealthy, and to induce him to be reconciled to their union, and to enable her and her husband to remain in Spain. Guzman was inflexible. Wealthy, and proud of his wealth as he was, he might have digested the unpalatable morsel of her union with a poor man, whom he could have made rich; but he could not even swallow the intelligence that she had married a Protestant. Ines, for that was her name, and her husband, went to Germany, partly in dependence on his musical talents, which were highly appreciated in that country,–partly in the vague hope of emigrants, that change of place will be attended with change of circumstances,–and partly, also, from the feeling, that misfortune is better tolerated any where than in the presence of those who inflict it. Such was the tale told by the old, who affected to remember the facts,–and believed by the young, whose imagination supplied all the defects of memory, and pictured to them an interesting beauty, with her children hanging about her, embarking, with a heretic husband, for a distant country, and sadly bidding farewell to the land and the religion of her fathers.

'Now, while these things were talked of at Seville, Guzman fell sick, and was given over by the physicians, whom with considerable reluctance he had suffered to be called in.

'In the progress of his illness, whether nature revisited a heart she long appeared to have deserted,–or whether he conceived that the hand of a relative might be a more grateful support to his dying head than that of a rapacious and mercenary menial,–or whether his resentful feelings burnt faintly at the expected approach of death, as artificial fires wax dim at the appearance of morning;–so it was, that Guzman in his illness bethought himself of his sister and her family,–sent off, at a considerable expence, an express to that part of Germany where she resided, to invite her to return and be reconciled to him,–and prayed devoutly that he might be permitted to survive till he could breathe his last amid the arms of her and her children. Moreover, there was a report at this time, in which the hearers probably took more interest than in any thing that related merely to the life or death of Guzman,–and this was, that he had rescinded his former will, and sent for a notary, with whom, in spite of his apparent debility, he remained locked up for some hours, dictating in a tone which, however clear to the notary, did not leave one distinct impression of sound on the ears that were strained, even to an agony of listening, at the double-locked door of his chamber.

'All Guzman's friends had endeavoured to dissuade him from making this exertion, which, they assured him, would only hasten his dissolution. But to their surprise, and doubtless their delight, from the moment his will was made, Guzman's health began to amend,–and in less than a week he began to walk about his chamber, and calculate what time it might take an express to reach Germany, and how soon he might expect intelligence from his family.

'Some months had passed away, and the priests took advantage of the interval to get about Guzman. But after exhausting every effort of ingenuity,–after plying him powerfully but unavailingly on the side of conscience, of duty, of fear, and of religion,–they began to understand their interest, and change their battery. And finding that the settled purpose of Guzman's soul was not to be changed, and that he was determined on recalling his sister and her family to Spain, they contented themselves with requiring that he should have no communication with the heretic family, except through them,–and never see his sister or her children unless they were witnesses to the interview.

'This condition was easily complied with, for Guzman felt no decided inclination for seeing his sister, whose presence might have reminded him of feelings alienated, and duties forgot. Besides, he was a man of fixed habits; and the presence of the most interesting being on earth, that threatened the slightest interruption or suspension of those habits, would have been to him insupportable.

'Thus we are all indurated by age and habit,–and feel ultimately, that the dearest connexions of nature or passion may be sacrificed to those petty indulgences which the presence or influence of a stranger may disturb. So Guzman compromised between his conscience and his feelings. He determined, in spite of all the priests in Seville, to invite his sister and her family to Spain, and to leave the mass of his immense fortune to them; (and to that effect he wrote, and wrote repeatedly and explicitly). But, on the other hand, he promised and swore to his spiritual counsellors, that he never would see one individual of the family; and that, though his sister might inherit his fortune, she never–never should see his face. The priests were satisfied, or appeared to be so, with this declaration; and Guzman, having propitiated them with ample offerings to the shrines of various saints, to each of whom his recovery was exclusively attributed, sat down to calculate the probable expence of his sister's return to Spain, and the necessity of providing for her family, whom he had, as it were, rooted from their native bed; and therefore felt bound, in all honesty, to make them flourish in the soil into which he had transplanted them.

'Within the year, his sister, her husband, and four children, returned to Spain. Her name was Ines, her husband's was Walberg. He was an industrious man, and an excellent musician. His talents had obtained for him the place of Maestro di Capella to the Duke of Saxony; and his children were educated (according to his means) to supply his place when vacated by death or accident, or to employ themselves as musical teachers in the courts of German princes. He and his wife had lived with the utmost frugality, and looked to their children for the means of increasing, by the exercise of their talents, that subsistence which it was their daily labour to provide.

'The eldest son, who was called Everhard, inherited his father's musical talents. The daughters, Julia and Ines, were musical also, and very skilful in embroidery. The youngest child, Maurice, was by turns the delight and the torment of the family.

'They had struggled on for many years in difficulties too petty to be made the subject of detail, yet too severe not to be painfully felt by those whose lot is to encounter them every day, and every hour of the day,–when the sudden intelligence, brought by an express from Spain, of their wealthy relative Guzman inviting them to return thither, and proclaiming them heirs to all his vast riches, burst on them like the first dawn of his half-year's summer on the 

crouching and squalid inmate of a Lapland hut. All trouble was forgot,–all cares postponed,–their few debts paid off,–and their preparations made for an instant departure to Spain.

'So to Spain they went, and journeyed on to the city of Seville, where, on their arrival, they were waited on by a grave ecclesiastic, who acquainted them with Guzman's resolution of never seeing his offending sister or her family, while at the same time he assured them of his intention of supporting and supplying them with every comfort, till his decease put them in possession of his wealth. The family were somewhat disturbed at this intelligence, and the mother wept at being denied the sight of her brother, for whom she still cherished the affection of memory; while the priest, by way of softening the discharge of his commission, dropt some words of a change of their heretical opinions being most likely to open a channel of communication between them and their relative. The silence with which this hint was received spoke more than many words, and the priest departed.

'This was the first cloud that had intercepted their view of felicity since the express arrived in Germany, and they sat gloomily enough under its shadow for the remainder of the evening. Walberg, in the confidence of expected wealth, had not only brought over his children to Spain, but had written to his father and mother, who were very old, and wretchedly poor, to join him in Seville; and by the sale of his house and furniture, had been enabled to remit them money for the heavy expences of so long a journey. They were now hourly expected, and the children, who had a faint but grateful recollection of the blessing bestowed on their infant heads by quivering lips and withered hands, looked out with joy for the arrival of the ancient pair. Ines had often said to her husband, 'Would it not be better to let your father and mother remain in Germany, and remit them money for their support, than put them to the fatigue of so long a journey at their far advanced age?'–And he had always answered, 'Let them rather die under my roof, than live under that of strangers.'

'This night he perhaps began to feel the prudence of his wife's advice;–she saw it, and with cautious gentleness forbore, for that very reason, to remind him of it.

'The weather was gloomy and cold that evening,–it was unlike a night in Spain. Its chill appeared to extend to the party. Ines sat and worked in silence–the children, collected at the window, communicated in whispers their hopes and conjectures about the arrival of the aged travellers, and Walberg, who was restlessly traversing the room, sometimes sighed as he overheard them.

'The next day was sunny and cloudless. The priest again called on them, and, after regretting that Guzman's resolution was inflexible, informed them, that he was directed to pay them an annual sum for their support, which he named, and which appeared to them enormous; and to appropriate another for the education of the children, which seemed to be calculated on a scale of princely munificence. He put deeds, properly drawn and attested for this purpose, into their hands, and then withdrew, after repeating the assurance, that they would be the undoubted heirs of Guzman's wealth at his decease, and that, as the interval would be passed in affluence, it might well be passed without repining. The priest had scarcely retired, when the aged parents of Walberg arrived, feeble from joy and fatigue, but not exhausted, and the whole family sat down to a meal that appeared to them luxurious, in that placid contemplation of future felicity, which is often more exquisite than its actual enjoyment.

'I saw them,' said the stranger, interrupting himself,–'I saw them on the evening of that day of union, and a painter, who wished to embody the image of domestic felicity in a group of living figures, need have gone no further than the mansion of Walberg. He and his wife were seated at the head of the table, smiling on their children, and seeing them smile in return, without the intervention of one anxious thought,–one present harassing of petty difficulty, or heavy presage of future mischance,–one fear of the morrow, or aching remembrance of the past. Their children formed indeed a groupe on which the eye of painter or of parent, the gaze of taste or of affection, might have hung with equal delight. Everhard their eldest son, now sixteen, possessed too much beauty for his sex, and his delicate and brilliant complexion, his slender and exquisitely moulded form, and the modulation of his tender and tremulous voice, inspired that mingled interest, with which we watch, in youth, over the strife of present debility with the promise of future strength, and infused into his parent's hearts that fond anxiety with which we mark the progress of a mild but cloudy morning in spring, rejoicing in the mild and balmy glories of its dawn, but fearing lest clouds may overshade them before noon. The daughters, Ines and Julia, had all the loveliness of their colder climate–the luxuriant ringlets of golden hair, the large bright blue eyes, the snow-like whiteness of their bosoms, and slender arms, and the rose-leaf tint and peachiness of their delicate cheeks, made them, as they attended their parents with graceful and fond officiousness, resemble two young Hebes ministering cups, which their touch alone was enough to turn into nectar.

'The spirits of these young persons had been early depressed by the difficulties in which their parents were involved; and even in childhood they had acquired the timid tread, the whispered tone, the anxious and inquiring look, that the constant sense of domestic distress painfully teaches even to children, and which it is the most exquisite pain to a parent to witness. But now there was nothing to restrain their young hearts,–that stranger, a smile, fled back rejoicing to the lovely home of their lips,–and the timidity of their former habits only lent a grateful shade to the brilliant exuberance of youthful happiness. Just opposite this picture, whose hues were so bright, and whose shades were so tender, were seated the figures of the aged grandfather and grandmother. The contrast was very strong; there was no connecting link, no graduated medium,–you passed at once from the first and fairest flowers of spring, to the withered and rootless barrenness of winter.

'These very aged persons, however, had something in their looks to soothe the eye, and Teniers or Wouverman would perhaps have valued their figures and costume far beyond those of their young and lovely grandchildren. They were stiffly and quaintly habited in their German garb–the old man in his doublet and cap, and the old woman in her ruff, stomacher, and head-gear resembling a skullcap, with long depending pinners, through which a few white, but very long hairs, appeared on her wrinkled cheeks; but on the countenances of both there was a gleam of joy, like the cold smile of a setting sun on a wintry landscape. They did not distinctly hear the kind importunities of their son and daughter, to partake more amply of the most plentiful meal they had ever witnessed in their frugal lives,–but they bowed and smiled with that thankfulness which is at once wounding and grateful to the hearts of affectionate children. They smiled also at the beauty of Everhard and their elder grandchildren,–at the wild pranks of Maurice, who was as wild in the hour of trouble as in the hour of prosperity;–and finally, they smiled at all that was said, though they did not hear half of it, and at all they saw, though they could enjoy very little–and that smile of age, that placid submission to the pleasures of the young, mingled with undoubted anticipations of a more pure and perfect felicity, gave an almost heavenly expression to features, that would otherwise have borne only the withering look of debility and decay.

'Some circumstances occurred during this family feast, which were sufficiently characteristic of the partakers. Walberg (himself a very temperate man) pressed his father repeatedly to take more wine than he was accustomed to,–the old man gently declined it. The son still pressed it heartfully, and the old man complied with a wish to gratify his son, not himself.

'The younger children, too, caressed their grandmother with the boisterous fondness of children. Their mother reproached them.–'Nay, let be,' said the gentle old woman. 'They trouble you, mother,' said the wife of Walberg.–'They cannot trouble me long,' said the grandmother, with an emphatic smile. 'Father,' said Walberg, 'is not Everhard grown very tall?'–'The last time I saw him,' said the grandfather, 'I stooped to kiss him; now I think he must stoop to kiss me.' And, at the word, Everhard darted like an arrow into the trembling arms that were opened to receive him, and his red and hairless lips were pressed to the snowy beard of his grandfather. 'Cling there, my child,' said the exulting father.–'God grant your kiss may never be applied to lips less pure.'–'They never shall, my father!' said the susceptible boy, blushing at his own emotions–'I never wish to press any lips but those that will bless me like those of my grandfather.'–'And do you wish,' said the old man jocularly, 'that the blessing should always issue from lips as rough and hoary as mine?' Everhard stood blushing behind the old man's chair at this question, and Walberg, who heard the clock strike the hour at which he had been always accustomed, in prosperity or adversity, to summon his family to prayer, made a signal which his children well understood, and which was communicated in whispers to their aged relatives.–'Thank God,' said the aged grandmother to the young whisperer, and as she spoke, she sunk on her knees. Her grandchildren assisted her. 'Thank God,' echoed the old man, bending his stiffened knees, and doffing his cap–'Thank God for this 'shadow of a great rock in a weary land!''–and he knelt, while Walberg, after reading a chapter or two from a German Bible which he held in his hands, pronounced an extempore prayer, imploring God to fill their hearts with gratitude for the temporal blessings they enjoyed, and to enable them 'so to pass through things temporal, that they might not finally lose the things eternal.' At the close of the prayer, the family rose and saluted each other with that affection which has not its root in earth, and whose blossoms, however diminutive and colourless to the eye of man in this wretched soil, shall yet bear glorious fruit in the garden of God. It was a lovely sight to behold the young people assisting their aged relatives to arise from their knees,–and it was a lovelier hearing, to listen to the happy good-nights exchanged among the parting family. The wife of Walberg was most assiduous in preparing the comforts of her husband's parents, and Walberg yielded to her with that proud gratitude, that feels more exaltation in a benefit conferred by those we love, than if we conferred it ourselves. He loved his parents, but he was proud of his wife loving them because they were his. To the repeated offers of his children to assist or attend their ancient relatives, he answered, 'No, dear children, your mother will do better,–your mother always does best.' As he spoke, his children, according to a custom now forgot, kneeled before him to ask his blessing. His hand, tremulous with affection, rested first on the curling locks of the darling Everhard, whose head towered proudly above those of his kneeling sisters, and of Maurice, who, with the irrepressible and venial levity of joyous childhood, laughed as he knelt. 'God bless you!' said Walberg–'God bless you all,–and may he make you as good as your mother, and as happy as–your father is this night;' and as he spoke, the happy father turned aside and wept.





CHAPTER XXVII



–Quæque ipsa miserrima vidi,
Et quorum pars magna fui.
 
VIRGIL.


'The wife of Walberg, who was naturally of a cool sedate temper, and to whom misfortune had taught an anxious and jealous prevoyance, was not so intoxicated with the present prosperity of the family, as its young, or even its aged members. Her mind was full of thoughts which she would not communicate to her husband, and sometimes did not wish to acknowledge to herself; but to the priest, who visited them frequently with renewed marks of Guzman's bounty, she spoke explicitly. She said, that however grateful for her brother's kindness, for the enjoyment of present competence, and the hope of future wealth, she wished that her children might be permitted to acquire the means of independent subsistence for themselves, and that the money destined by Guzman's liberality for their ornamental education, might be applied to the purpose of ensuring them the power of supporting themselves, and assisting their parents. She alluded slightly to the possible future change in her brother's favourable feelings towards her, and dwelt much on the circumstance of her children being strangers in the country, wholly unacquainted with its language, and averse from its religion; and she mildly but strongly stated the difficulties to which a heretic family of strangers might be exposed in a Catholic country, and implored the priest to employ his mediation and influence with her brother, that her children might be enabled, through his bounty, to acquire the means of independent subsistence, as if–and she paused. The good and friendly priest (for he was truly both) listened to her with attention; and after satisfying his conscience, by adjuring her to renounce her heretical opinions, as the only means of obtaining a reconciliation with God and her brother, and receiving a calm, but firm negative, proceeded to give her his best lay advice, which was to comply with her brother's wishes in every thing, to educate her children in the manner which he prescribed, and to the full extent of the means which he so amply furnished. He added, en confiance, that Guzman, though, during his long life, he had never been suspected of any passion but that of accumulating money, was now possessed with a spirit much harder to expel, and was resolved that the heirs of his wealth should be, in point of all that might embellish polished society, on a level with the descendants of the first nobility of Spain. Finally, he counselled submission to her brother's wishes in all things,–and the wife of Walberg complied with tears, which she tried to conceal from the priest, and had completely effaced the traces of before she again met her husband.

'In the mean time, the plan of Guzman was rapidly realized. A handsome house was taken for Walberg,–his sons and daughters were splendidly arrayed, and sumptuously lodged; and, though education was, and still is, on a very low level in Spain, they were taught all that was then supposed to qualify them as companions for the descendants of Hidalgoes. Any attempt, or even allusion to their being prepared for the ordinary occupations of life, was strictly forbidden by the orders of Guzman. The father triumphed in this,–the mother regretted it, but she kept her regret to herself, and consoled herself with thinking, that the ornamental education her children were receiving might ultimately be turned to account; for the wife of Walberg was a woman whom the experience of misfortune had taught to look to the future with an anxious eye, and that eye, with ominous accuracy, had seldom failed to detect a speck of evil in the brightest beam of sun-shine that had ever trembled on her chequered existence.

'The injunctions of Guzman were obeyed,–the family lived in luxury. The young people plunged into their new life of enjoyment with an avidity proportioned to their youthful sensibility of pleasure, and to a taste for refinement and elegant pursuits, which their former obscurity had repressed, but never extinguished. The proud and happy father exulted in the personal beauty, and improving talents of his children. The anxious mother sighed sometimes, but took care the sigh should never reach her husband's ear. The aged grandfather and grandmother, whose infirmities had been much increased by their journey to Spain, and possibly still more by that strong emotion which is a habit to youth, but a convulsion to age, sat in their ample chairs comfortably idle, dozing away life in intervals of unuttered though conscious satisfaction, and calm but venerable apathy;–they slept much, but when they awoke, they smiled at their grandchildren, and at each other.

'The wife of Walberg, during this interval, which seemed one of undisturbed felicity to all but her, sometimes suggested a gentle caution,–a doubtful and anxious hint,–a possibility of future disappointment, but this was soon smiled away by the rosy, and laughing, and kissful lips of her children, till the mother at last began to smile at her apprehensions herself. At times, however, she led them anxiously in the direction of their uncle's house. She walked up and down the street before his door with her children, and sometimes lifted up her veil, as if to try whether her eye could pierce through walls as hard as the miser's heart, or windows barred like his coffers,–then glancing on her children's costly dress, while her eye darted far into futurity, she sighed and returned slowly home. This state of suspence was soon to be terminated.

'The priest, Guzman's confessor, visited them often; first in quality of almoner or agent of his bounty, which was amply and punctually bestowed through his hands; and secondly, in quality of a professed chess-player, at which game he had met, even in Spain, no antagonist like Walberg. He also felt an interest in the family and their fortunes, which, though his orthodoxy disowned, his heart could not forbear to acknowledge,–so the good priest compromised matters by playing chess with the father, and praying for the conversion of his family on his return to Guzman's house. It was while engaged in the former exercise, that a message arrived to summon him on the instant home,–the priest left his queen en prise, and hurried into the passage to speak with the messenger. The family of Walberg, with agitation unspeakable, half rose to follow him. They paused at the door, and then retreated with a mixed feeling of anxiety for the intelligence, and shame at the attitude in which they might be discovered. As they retreated, however, they could not help hearing the words of the messenger,–'He is at his last gasp,–he has sent for you,–you must not lose a moment.' As the messenger spoke, the priest and he departed.

'The family returned to their apartment, and for some hours sat in profound silence, interrupted only by the ticking of the clock, which was distinctly and solely heard, and which seemed too loud to their quickened ears, amid that deep stillness on which it broke incessantly,–or by the echoes of Walberg's hurried step, as he started from his chair and traversed the apartment. At this sound they turned, as if expecting a messenger, then, glancing at the silent figure of Walberg, sunk on their seats again. The family sat up all that long night of unuttered, and indeed unutterable emotion. The lights burnt low, and were at length extinguished, but no one noticed them;–the pale light of the dawn broke feebly into the room, but no one observed it was morning. 'God!–how long he lingers!' exclaimed Walberg involuntarily; and these words, though uttered under his breath, made all the listeners start, as at the first sounds of a human voice, which they had not heard for many hours.

'At this moment a knock was heard at the door,–a step trod slowly along the passage that led to the room,–the door opened, and the priest appeared. He advanced into the room without speaking, or being spoken to. And the contrast of strong emotion and unbroken silence,–this conflict of speech that strangled thought in the utterance, and of thought that in vain asked aid of speech,–the agony and the muteness,–formed a terrible momentary association. It was but momentary,–the priest, as he stood, uttered the words–'All is over!' Walberg clasped his hands over his forehead, and in ecstatic agony exclaimed,–'Thank God!' and wildly catching at the object nearest him, as if imagining it one of his children, he clasped and hugged it to his breast. His wife wept for a moment at the thought of her brother's death, but roused herself for her children's sake to hear all that was to be told. The Priest could tell no more but that Guzman was dead,–seals had been put on every chest, drawer, and coffer in the house,–not a cabinet had escaped the diligence of the persons employed,–and the will was to be read the following day.

'For the following day the family remained in that intensity of expectation that precluded all thought. The servants prepared the usual meal, but it remained untasted. The family pressed each other to partake of it; but as the importunity was not enforced by the inviter setting any example of the lesson he tried to teach, the meal remained untasted. About noon a grave person, in the habit of a notary, was announced, and summoned Walberg to be present at the opening of Guzman's will. As Walberg prepared to obey the summons, one of his children officiously offered him his hat, another his cloke, both of which he had forgot in the trepidation of his anxiety; and these instances of reminiscence and attention in his children, contrasted with his own abstraction, completely overcame him, and he sunk down on a seat to recover himself. 'You had better not go, my love,' said his wife mildly. 'I believe I shall–I must take your advice,' said Walberg, relapsing on the seat from which he had half risen. The notary, with a formal bow, was retiring. 'I will go!' said Walberg, swearing a German oath, whose gutteral sound made the notary start,–'I will go!' and as he spoke he fell on the floor, exhausted by fatigue and want of refreshment, and emotion indescribable but to a father. The notary retired, and a few hours more were exhausted in torturing conjecture, expressed on the mother's part only by clasped hands and smothered sighs,–on the father's by profound silence, averted countenance, and hands that seemed to feel for those of his children, and then shrink from the touch,–and on the children's by rapidly varying auguries of hope and of disappointment. The aged pair sat motionless among their family;–they knew not what was going on, but they knew if it was good they must partake of it,–and in the perception or expectation of the approach of evil, their faculties had latterly become very obtuse.

'The day was far advanced,–it was noon. The servants, with whom the munificence of the deceased had amply supplied their establishment, announced that dinner was prepared; and Ines, who retained more presence of mind than the rest, gently suggested to her husband the necessity of not betraying their emotions to their servants. He obeyed her hint mechanically, and walked into the dining-hall, forgetting for the first time to offer his arm to his infirm father. His family followed, but, when seated at the table, they seemed not to know for what purpose they were collected there. Walberg, consumed by that thirst of anxiety which nothing seems sufficient to quench, called repeatedly for wine; and his wife, who found even the attempt to eat impossible in the presence of the gazing and unmoved attendants, dismissed them by a signal, but did not feel the desire of food restored by their absence. The old couple eat as usual, and sometimes looked up with an expression of vague and vacant wonder, and a kind of sluggish reluctance to admit the fear or belief of approaching calamity. Towards the end of their cheerless meal, Walberg was called out; he returned in a few minutes, and there was no appearance of change in his countenance. He seated himself, and only his wife perceived the traces of a wild smile stealing over the trembling lines of his face, as he filled a large glass of wine, and raised it to his lips, pronouncing–'A health to the heirs of Guzman.' But instead of drinking the wine, he dashed the glass to the floor, and burying his head in the drapery of the table on which he flung himself, he exclaimed, 'Not a ducat,–not a ducat,–all left to the church!–Not a ducat!'

* * * *

'In the evening the priest called, and found the family much more composed. The certainty of evil had given them a kind of courage. Suspence is the only evil against which it is impossible to set up a defence,–and, like young mariners in an untried sea, they almost felt ready to welcome the storm, as a relief from the deadly and loathsome sickness of anxiety. The honest resentment, and encouraging manner of the priest, were a cordial to their ears and hearts. He declared his belief, that nothing but the foulest means that might be resorted to by interested and bigotted monks, could have extorted such a will from the dying man,–his readiness to attest, in every court in Spain, the intentions of the testator (till within a few hours of his death) to have bequeathed his whole fortune to his family,–intentions which he had repeatedly expressed to him and others, and to whose effect he had seen a former will of no long date,–and, finally, gave his strenuous advice to Walberg to bring the matter to legal arbitration, in aid of which he promised his personal exertions, his influence with the ablest advocates in Seville, and every thing–but money.

'The family that night went to bed with spirits exalted by hope, and slept in peace. One circumstance alone marked a change in their feelings and habits. As they were retiring, the old man laid his tremulous hand on the shoulder of Walberg, and said mildly, 'My son, shall we pray before we retire?'–'Not to-night, father,' said Walberg, who perhaps feared the mention of their heretical worship might alienate the friendly priest, or who felt the agitation of his heart too great for the solemn exercise; 'Not to-night, I am–too happy!'

'The priest was as good as his word,–the ablest advocates in Seville undertook the cause of Walberg. Proofs of undue influence, of imposition, and of terror being exercised on the mind of the testator, were ingeniously made out by the diligence and spiritual authority of the priest, and skilfully arranged and ably pleaded by the advocates. Walberg's spirits rose with every hour. The family, at the time of Guzman's death, were in possession of a considerable sum of money, but this was soon expended, together with another sum which the frugality of Ines had enabled her to save, and which she now cheerfully produced in aid of her husband's exigencies, and in confidence of eventual success. When all was gone, other resources still remained,–the spacious house was disposed of, the servants dismissed, the furniture sold (as usual) for about a fourth of its value, and, in their new and humble abode in the suburbs of Seville, Ines and her daughters contentedly resumed those domestic duties which they had been in the habit of performing in their quiet home in Germany. Amid these changes, the grandfather and grandmother experienced none but mere change of place, of which they hardly appeared conscious. The assiduous attention of Ines to their comforts was increased, not diminished, by the necessity of being herself the sole ministrant to them; and smiling she pleaded want of appetite, or trifling indisposition, as an excuse for her own and her children's meal, while theirs was composed of every thing that could tempt the tasteless palate of age, or that she remembered was acceptable to theirs.

'The cause had now come to a hearing, and for the two first days the advocates of Walberg carried all before them. On the third the ecclesiastical advocates made a firm and vigorous stand. Walberg returned much dispirited;–his wife saw it, and therefore assumed no airs of cheerfulness, which only increase the irritation of misfortune, but she was equable, and steadily and tranquilly occupied in domestic business the whole evening in his sight. As they were separating for the night, by a singular contingency, the old man again reminded his son of the forgotten hour of family prayer. 'Not to-night, father,' said Walberg impatiently; 'not to-night; I am–too unhappy!'–'Thus,' said the old man, lifting up his withered hands, and speaking with an energy he had not showed for years,–'thus, O my God! prosperity and adversity alike furnish us with excuses for neglecting thee!' As he tottered from the room, Walberg declined his head on the bosom of his wife, who sat beside him, and shed a few bitter tears. And Ines whispered to herself, 'The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit,–a broken heart he will not despise.'

* * * *

'The cause had been carried on with a spirit and expedition that had no precedent in the courts of Spain, and the fourth day was fixed on for a final hearing and termination of the cause. The day dawned, and at the dawn of day Walberg arose, and walked for some hours before the gates of the hall of justice; and when they were opened, he entered, and sat down mechanically on a seat in the vacant hall, with the same look of profound attention, and anxious interest, that he would have assumed had the court been seated, and the cause about to be decided. After a few moment's pause, he sighed, started, and appearing to awake from a dream, quitted his seat, and walked up and down the empty passages till the court was prepared to sit.

'The court met early that day, and the cause was powerfully advocated. Walberg sat on one seat, without ever changing his place, till all was over; and it was then late in the evening, and he had taken no refreshment the entire day, and he had never changed his place, and he had never changed the close and corrupted atmosphere of the crowded court for a moment. Quid multis morer? The chance of a heretic stranger, against the interests of churchmen in Spain, may be calculated by the most shallow capacity.

'The family had all that day sat in the innermost room of their humble dwelling. Everhard had wished to accompany his father to the court,–his mother withheld him. The sisters involuntarily dropt their work from time to time, and their mother gently reminded them of the necessity of renewing it. They did resume it, but their hands, at variance with their feelings, made such blunders, that their mother, , removed their work, and suggested to them some active employment in household affairs. While they were thus engaged, evening came on,–the family from time to time suspended their ordinary occupations, and crowded to the window to watch the return of their father. Their mother no longer interfered,–she sat in silence, and this silence formed a strong contrast to the restless impatience of her children. 'That is my father,' exclaimed the voices of the four at once, as a figure crossed the street. 'That is not my father,' they repeated, as the figure slowly retired. A knock was heard at the door,–Ines herself rushed forward to open it. A figure retreated, advanced again, and again retreated. Then it seemed to rush past her, and enter the house like a shadow. In terror she followed it, and with terror unutterable saw her husband kneeling among his children, who in vain attempted to raise him, while he continued to repeat, 'No, let me kneel,–let me kneel, I have undone you all! The cause is lost, and I have made beggars of you all!'–'Rise,–rise, dearest father,' cried the children, gathering round him, 'nothing is lost, if you are saved!'–'Rise, my love, from that horrible and unnatural humiliation,' cried Ines, grasping the arms of her husband; 'help me, my children,–father,–mother, will you not help me?'–and as she spoke, the tottering, helpless, and almost lifeless figures of the aged grandfather and grandmother arose from their chairs, and staggering forwards, added their feeble strength,–their vis impotentiæ, to sustain or succour the weight that dragged heavily on the arms of the children and their mother. By this sight, more than by any effort, Walberg was raised from the posture that agonized his family, and placed in a chair, around which hung the wife and children, while the aged father and mother, retreating torpidly to their seats, seemed to lose in a few moments the keen consciousness of evil that had inspired them for an instant with a force almost miraculous. Ines and her children hung round Walberg, and uttered all of consolation that helpless affection could suggest; but perhaps there is not a more barbed arrow can be sent through the heart, than by the thought that the hands that clasp ours so fondly cannot earn for us or themselves the means of another meal,–that the lips that are pressed to ours so warmly, may the next ask us for bread, and–ask in vain!

'It was perhaps fortunate for this unhappy family, that the very extremity of their grief rendered its long indulgence impossible,–the voice of necessity made itself be heard distinctly and loudly amid all the cry and clamour of that hour of agony. Something must be done for the morrow,–and it was to be done immediately. 'What money have you?' was the first articulate sentence Walberg uttered to his wife; and when she whispered the small sum that the expences of their lost cause had left them, he shivered with a brief emphatic spasm of horror,–then bursting from their arms, and rising, he crossed the room, as if he wished to be alone for a moment. As he did so, he saw his youngest child playing with the long strings of his grandfather's band,–a mode of sportive teazing in which the urchin delighted, and which was at once chid and smiled at. Walberg struck the poor child vehemently, and then catching him in his arms, bid him–'Smile as long as he could!'

* * * *

'They had means of subsistence at least for the following week; and that was such a source of comfort to them, as it is to men who are quitting a wreck, and drifting on a bare raft with a slender provision towards some coast, which they hope to reach before it is exhausted. They sat up all that night together in earnest counsel, after Ines had taken care to see the father and mother of her husband comfortably placed in their apartment. Amid their long and melancholy conference, hope sprung up insensibly in the hearts of the speakers, and a plan was gradually formed for obtaining the means of subsistence. Walberg was to offer his talents as a musical teacher,–Ines and her daughters were to undertake embroidery,–and Everhard, who possessed exquisite taste both in music and drawing, was to make an effort in both departments, and the friendly priest was to be applied to for his needful interest and recommendation for all. The morning broke on their long-protracted consultation, and found them unwearied in discussing its subject. 'We shall not starve,' said the children hopefully.–'I trust not,' said Walberg sighingly.–His wife, who knew Spain, said not a word.–'





CHAPTER XXVIII



                              –This to me
In dreadful secrecy they did impart,
And I with them the third night kept the watch.
 
SHAKESPEARE


'As they spoke, a soft knock was heard, such as kindness gives at the door of misfortune, and Everhard started up to answer it. 'Stay,' said Walberg, absently, 'Where are the servants?' Then recollecting himself, he smiled agonizingly, and waved his hand to his son to go. It was the good priest. He entered, and sat down in silence,–no one spoke to him. It might be truly said, as it is sublimely said in the original, 'There was neither speech nor language, but voices were heard among them–'and felt too.' The worthy priest piqued himself on his orthodoxy of all matters of belief and form enjoined by the Catholic church; and, moreover, had acquired a kind of monastic apathy, of sanctified stoicism, which priests sometimes imagine is the conquest of grace over the rebellion of nature, when it is merely the result of a profession that denies nature its objects and its ties. Yet so it was, that as he sat among this afflicted family, after complaining of the keenness of the morning air, and wiping away in vain the moisture, which he said it had brought into his eyes, he at last yielded to his feelings, and 'lifted up his voice and wept.' But tears were not all he had to offer. On hearing the plans of Walberg and his family, he promised, with a faultering voice, his ready assistance in promoting them; and, as he rose to depart, observing that he had been entrusted by the faithful with a small sum for the relief of the unfortunate, and knew not where it could be better bestowed, he dropped from the sleeve of his habit a well filled purse on the floor, and hurried away.

'The family retired to rest as the day approached, but rose in a few hours afterwards without having slept; and the remainder of that day, and the whole of the three following, were devoted to applications at every door where encouragement might be expected, or employment obtained, the priest in person aiding every application. But there were many circumstances unfavourable to the ill-starred family of Walberg. They were strangers, and, with the exception of their mother, who acted as interpreter, ignorant of the language of the country. This was 'a sore evil,' extending almost to the total preclusion of their exertions as teachers. They were also heretics,–and this alone was a sufficient bar to their success in Seville. In some families the beauty of the daughters, in others that of the son, was gravely debated as an important objection. In others the recollection of their former splendour, suggested a mean and rancorous motive to jealous inferiority to insult them by a rejection, for which no other cause could be assigned. Unwearied and undismayed, they renewed their applications every day, at every house where admission could be obtained, and at many where it was denied; and each day they returned to examine the diminished stock, to divide the scantier meal, calculate how far it was possible to reduce the claims of nature to the level of their ebbing means, and smile when they talked of the morrow to each other, but weep when they thought of it alone. There is a withering monotony in the diary of misery,–'one day telleth another.' But there came at length a day, when the last coin was expended, the last meal devoured, the last resource exhausted, the last hope annihilated, and the friendly priest himself told them weeping, he had nothing to give them but his prayers.

'That evening the family sat in profound and stupified silence together for some hours, till the aged mother of Walberg, who had not for some months uttered any thing but indistinct monosyllables, or appeared conscious of any thing that was going on, suddenly, with that ominous energy that announces its effort to be the last,–that bright flash of parting life that precedes its total extinction, exclaimed aloud, apparently addressing her husband, 'There is something wrong here,–why did they bring us from Germany? They might have suffered us to die there,–they have brought us here to mock us, I think. Yesterday,–(her memory evidently confounding the dates of her son's prosperous and adverse fortune), yesterday they clothed me in silk, and I drank wine, and to-day they give me this sorry crust,–(flinging away the piece of bread which had been her share of the miserable meal),–there is something wrong here. I will go back to Germany,–I will!' and she rose from her seat in the sight of the astonished family, who, horror-struck, as they would have been at the sudden resuscitation of a corse, ventured not to oppose her by word or movement. 'I will go back to Germany,' she repeated; and, rising, she actually took three or four firm and equal steps on the floor, while no one attempted to approach her. Then her force, both physical and mental, seemed to fail,–she tottered,–her voice sunk into hollow mutterings, as she repeated, 'I know the way,–I know the way,–if it was not so dark.–I have not far to go,–I am very near–home!' As she spoke, she fell across the feet of Walberg. The family collected round her, and raised–a corse. 'Thank God!' exclaimed her son, as he gazed on his mother's corse.–And this reversion of the strongest feeling of nature,–this wish for the death of those for whom, in other circumstances, we would ourselves have died, makes those who have experienced it feel as if there was no evil in life but want, and no object of rational pursuit but the means of avoiding it. Alas! if it be so, for what purpose were hearts that beat, and minds that burn, bestowed on us? Is all the energy of intellect, and all the enthusiasm of feeling, to be expended in contrivances how to meet or shift off the petty but torturing pangs of hourly necessity? Is the fire caught from heaven to be employed in lighting a faggot to keep the cold from the numbed and wasted fingers of poverty? Pardon this digression, Senhor,' said the stranger, 'but I had a painful feeling, that forced me to make it.' He then proceeded.

'The family collected around the dead body,–and it might have been a subject worthy the pencil of the first of painters, to witness its interment, as it took place the following night. As the deceased was a heretic, the corse was not allowed to be laid in consecrated ground; and the family, solicitous to avoid giving offence, or attracting notice on the subject of their religion, were the only attendants on the funeral. In a small inclosure, at the rear of their wretched abode, her son dug his mother's grave, and Ines and her daughters placed the body in it. Everhard was absent in search of employment,–as they hoped,–and a light was held by the youngest child, who smiled as he watched the scene, as if it had been a pageant got up for his amusement. That light, feeble as it was, showed the strong and varying expression of the countenances on which it fell;–in Walberg's there was a stern and fearful joy, that she whom they were laying to rest had been 'taken from the evil to come,'–in that of Ines there was grief, mingled with something of horror, at this mute and unhallowed ceremony.–Her daughters, pale with grief and fear, wept silently; but their tears were checked, and the whole course of their feelings changed, when the light fell on another figure who appeared suddenly standing among them on the edge of the grave,–it was that of Walberg's father. Impatient of being left alone, and wholly unconscious of the cause, he had groped and tottered his way till he reached the spot; and now, as he saw his son heap up the earth over the grave, he exclaimed, with a brief and feeble effort of reminiscence, sinking on the ground, 'Me, too,–lay me there, the same spot will serve for both!' His children raised and supported him into the house, where the sight of Everhard, with an unexpected supply of provisions, made them forget the horrors of the late scene, and postpone once more the fears of want till to-morrow. No inquiry how this supply was obtained, could extort more from Everhard than that it was the gift of charity. He looked exhausted and dreadfully pale,–and, forbearing to press him with further questions, they partook of this manna-meal,–this food that seemed to have dropped from heaven, and separated for the night.

* * * *

'Ines had, during this period of calamity, unremittingly enforced the application of her daughters to those accomplishments from which she still derived the hopes of their subsistence. Whatever were the privations and disappointments of the day, their musical and other exercises were strictly attended to; and hands enfeebled by want and grief, plied their task with as much assiduity as when occupation was only a variation of luxury. This attention to the ornaments of life, when its actual necessaries are wanted,–this sound of music in a house where the murmurs of domestic anxiety are heard every moment,–this subservience of talent to necessity, all its generous enthusiasm lost, and only its possible utility remembered or valued,–is perhaps the bitterest strife that ever was fought between the opposing claims of our artificial and our natural existence. But things had now occurred that shook not only the resolution of Ines, but even affected her feelings beyond the power of repression. She had been accustomed to hear, with delight, the eager application of her daughters to their musical studies;–now–when she heard them, the morning after the interment of their grandmother, renewing that application–she felt as if the sounds struck through her heart. She entered the room where they were, and they turned towards her with their usual smiling demand for her approbation.

'The mother, with the forced smile of a sickening heart, said she believed there was no occasion for their practising any further that day. The daughters, who understood her too well, relinquished their instruments, and, accustomed to see every article of furniture converted into the means of casual subsistence, they thought no worse than that their ghitarras might be disposed of this day, and the next they hoped they would have to teach on those of their pupils. They were mistaken. Other symptoms of failing resolution,–of utter and hopeless abandonment, appeared that day. Walberg had always felt and expressed the strongest feelings of tender respect towards his parents–his father particularly, whose age far exceeded that of his mother. At the division of their meal that day, he shewed a kind of wilfish and greedy jealousy that made Ines tremble. He whispered to her–'How much my father eats–how heartily he feeds while we have scarce a morsel!'–'And let us want that morsel, before your father wants one!' said Ines in a whisper–'I have scarce tasted any thing myself.'–'Father–father,' cried Walberg, shouting in the ear of the doting old man, 'you are eating heartily, while Ines and her children are starving!' And he snatched the food from his father's hand, who gazed at him vacantly, and resigned the contested morsel without a struggle. A moment afterwards the old man rose from his seat, and with horrid unnatural force, tore the untasted meat from his grandchildren's lips, and swallowed it himself, while his rivelled and toothless mouth grinned at them in mockery at once infantine and malicious.

'Squabbling about your supper?' cried Everhard, bursting among them with a wild and feeble laugh,–'Why, here's enough for to-morrow–and to-morrow.' And he flung indeed ample means for two day's subsistence on the table, but he looked paler and paler. The hungry family devoured the hoard, and forgot to ask the cause of his increasing paleness, and obviously diminished strength.

* * * *

'They had long been without any domestics, and as Everhard disappeared mysteriously every day, the daughters were sometimes employed on the humble errands of the family. The beauty of the elder daughter, Julia, was so conspicuous, that her mother had often undertaken the most menial errands herself, rather than send her daughter into the streets unprotected. The following evening, however, being intently employed in some domestic occupation, she allowed Julia to go out to purchase their food for to-morrow, and lent her veil for the purpose, directing her daughter to arrange it in the Spanish fashion, with which she was well acquainted, so as to hide her face.

'Julia, who went with trembling steps on her brief errand, had somehow deranged her veil, and a glimpse of her beauty was caught by a cavalier who was passing. The meanness of her dress and occupation suggested hopes to him which he ventured to express. Julia burst from him with the mingled terror and indignation of insulted purity, but her eyes rested with unconscious avidity on the handful of gold which glittered in his hand.–She thought of her famishing parents,–of her own declining strength, and neglected useless talents. The gold still sparkled before her,–she felt–she knew not what, and to escape from some feelings is perhaps the best victory we can obtain over them. But when she arrived at home, she eagerly thrust the small purchase she had made into her mother's hand, and, though hitherto gentle, submissive, and tractable, announced, in a tone of decision that seemed to her startled mother (whose thoughts were always limited to the exigencies of the hour) like that of sudden insanity, that she would rather starve than ever again tread the streets of Seville alone.

'As Ines retired to her bed, she thought she heard a feeble moan from the room where Everhard lay, and where, from their being compelled to sell the necessary furniture of the bed, he had entreated his parents to allow Maurice to sleep with him, alleging that the warmth of his body would be a substitute for artificial covering to his little brother. Twice those moans were heard, but Ines did not dare to awake Walberg, who had sunk into that profound sleep which is as often the refuge of intolerable misery, as that of saturated enjoyment. A few moments after, when the moans had ceased, and she had half persuaded herself it was only the echo of that wave that seems for ever beating in the ears of the unfortunate,–the curtains of her bed were thrown open, and the figure of a child covered with blood, stained in breast, arms, and legs, appeared before her, and cried,–'It is Everhard's blood–he is bleeding to death,–I am covered with his blood!–Mother–mother–rise and save Everhard's life!' The object, the voice, the words, seemed to Ines like the imagery of some terrible dream, such as had lately often visited her sleep, till the tones of Maurice, her youngest, and (in her heart) her favourite child, made her spring from the bed, and hurry after the little blood-spotted figure that paddled before her on its naked feet, till she reached the adjoining room where Everhard lay. Amid all her anguish and fear, she trod as lightly as Maurice, lest she should awake Walberg.

'The moon-light fell strongly through the unshuttered windows on the wretched closet that just contained the bed. Its furniture was sufficiently scanty, and in his spasms Everhard had thrown off the sheet. So he lay, as Ines approached his bed, in a kind of corse-like beauty, to which the light of the moon gave an effect that would have rendered the figure worthy the pencil of a Murillo, a Rosa, or any of those painters, who, inspired by the genius of suffering, delight in representing the most exquisite of human forms in the extremity of human agony. A St Bartholomew flayed, with his skin hanging about him in graceful drapery–a St Laurence, broiled on a gridiron, and exhibiting his finely-formed anatomy on its bars, while naked slaves are blowing the coals beneath it,–even these were inferior to the form half-veiled,–half-disclosed by the moon-light as it lay. The snow-white limbs of Everhard were extended as if for the inspection of a sculptor, and moveless, as if they were indeed what they resembled, in hue and symmetry, those of a marble statue. His arms were tossed above his head, and the blood was trickling fast from the opened veins of both,–his bright and curled hair was clotted with the red stream that flowed from his arms,–his lips were blue, and a faint and fainter moan issued from them as his mother hung over him. This sight banished in a moment all other fears and feelings, and Ines shrieked aloud to her husband for assistance. Walberg, staggering from his sleep, entered the room,–the object before him was enough. Ines had only strength left to point to it. The wretched father rushed out in quest of medical aid, which he was obliged to solicit gratuitously, and in bad Spanish, while his accents betrayed him at every door he knocked at,–and closed them against him as a foreigner and a heretic. At length a barber-surgeon (for the professions were united in Seville) consented, with many a yawn, to attend him, and came duly armed with lint and styptics. The distance was short, and he was soon by the bed of the young sufferer. The parents observed, with consternation unspeakable, the languid looks of recognition, the ghastly smile of consciousness, that Everhard viewed him with, as he approached the bed; and when he had succeeded in stopping the hæmorrhage, and bound up the arms, a whisper passed between him and the patient, and the latter raised his bloodless hand to his lips, and uttered, 'Remember our bargain.' As the man retired, Walberg followed, and demanded to know the meaning of the words he had heard. Walberg was a German, and choleric–the surgeon was a Spaniard, and cool. 'I shall tell you to-morrow, Senhor,' said he, putting up his instruments,–'in the mean time be assured of my gratuitous attendance on your son, and of his certain recovery. We deem you heretics in Seville, but that youth is enough to canonize the whole family, and cover a multitude of sins.' And with these words he departed. The next day he attended Everhard, and so for several, till he was completely recovered, always refusing the slightest remuneration, till the father, whom misery had made suspicious of every thing and nothing, watched at the door, and heard the horrible secret. He did not disclose it to his wife,–but from that hour, it was observed that his gloom became more intense, and the communications he used to hold with his family, on the subject of their distress, and the modes of evading it by hourly expedients, utterly and finally ceased.

'Everhard, now recovered, but still pale as the widow of Seneca, was at last able to join the family consultation, and give advice, and suggest resources, with a mental energy that his physical weakness could not overcome. The next day, when they were assembled to debate on the means of procuring subsistence for the following one, they for the first time missed their father. At every word that was uttered, they turned to ask for his sanction–but he was not there. At last he entered the room, but without taking a part in their consultation. He leaned gloomily against the wall, and while Everhard and Julia, at every sentence, turned their appealing looks towards him, he sullenly averted his head. Ines, appearing to pursue some work, while her trembling fingers could scarce direct the needle, made a sign to her children not to observe him. Their voices were instantly depressed, and their heads bent closely towards each other. Mendicity appeared the only resource of this unfortunate family,–and they agreed, that the evening was the best time for trying its effect. The unhappy father remained rocking against the shattered wainscot till the arrival of evening. Ines repaired the clothes of the children, which were now so decayed, that every attempt at repair made a fresh rent, and the very thread she worked with seemed less attenuated than the worn-out materials it wrought on.

'The grandfather, still seated in his ample chair by the care of Ines, (for his son had grown very indifferent about him), watched her moving fingers, and exclaimed, with the petulance of dotage, 'Aye,–you are arraying them in embroidery, while I am in rags.–In rags!' he repeated, holding out the slender garments which the beggared family could with difficulty spare him. Ines tried to pacify him, and showed her work, to prove that it was the remnants of her children's former dress she was repairing; but, with horror unutterable, she perceived her husband incensed at these expressions of dotage, and venting his frantic and fearful indignation in language that she tried to bury the sound of, by pressing closer to the old man, and attempting to fix his bewildered attention on herself and her work. This was easily accomplished, and all was well, till they were about to separate on their wretched precarious errands. Then a new and untold feeling trembled at the heart of one of the young wanderers. Julia remembered the occurrence of a preceding evening,–she thought of the tempting gold, the flattering language, and the tender tone of the young cavalier. She saw her family perishing around her for want,–she felt it consuming her own vitals,–and as she cast her eye round the squalid room, the gold glittered brighter and brighter in her eye. A faint hope, aided perhaps by a still more faint suggestion of venial pride, swelled in her heart. 'Perhaps he might love me,' she whispered to herself, 'and think me not unworthy of his hand.' Then despair returned to the charge. 'I must die of famine,' she thought, 'if I return unaided,–and why may I not by my death benefit my family! I will never survive shame, but they may,–for they will not know it!'–She went out, and took a direction different from that of the family.

'Night came on,–the wanderers returned slowly one by one,–Julia was the last. Her brothers and sister had each obtained a trifling alms, for they had learned Spanish enough to beg in,–and the old man's face wore a vacant smile, as he saw the store produced, which was, after all, scarce sufficient to afford a meal for the youngest. 'And have you brought us nothing, Julia?' said her parents. She stood apart, and in silence. Her father repeated the question in a raised and angry voice. She started at the sound, and, rushing forward, buried her head in her mother's bosom. 'Nothing,–nothing,' she cried, in a broken and suffocated voice; 'I tried,–my weak and wicked heart submitted to the thought for a moment,–but no,–no, not even to save you from perishing, could I!–I came home to perish first myself!' Her shuddering parents comprehended her,–and amid their agony they blessed her and wept,–but not from grief. The meal was divided, of which Julia at first steadily refused to partake, as she had not contributed to it, till her reluctance was overcome by the affectionate importunity of the rest, and she complied.

'It was during this division of what all believed to be their last meal, that Walberg gave one of those proofs of sudden and fearful violence of temper, bordering on insanity, which he had betrayed latterly. He seemed to notice, with sullen displeasure, that his wife had (as she always did) reserved the largest portion for his father. He eyed it askance at first, muttering angrily to himself. Then he spoke more aloud, though not so as to be heard by the deaf old man, who was sluggishly devouring his sordid meal. Then the sufferings of his children seemed to inspire him with a kind of wild resentment, and he started up, exclaiming, 'My son sells his blood to a surgeon, to save us from perishing!1 My daughter trembles on the verge of prostitution, to procure us a meal!' Then fiercely addressing his father, 'And what dost thou do, old dotard? Rise up,–rise up, and beg for us thyself, or thou must starve!'–and, as he spoke, he raised his arm against the helpless old man. At this horrid sight, Ines shrieked aloud, and the children, rushing forward, interposed. The wretched father, incensed to madness, dealt blows among them, which were borne without a murmur; and then, the storm being exhausted, he sat down and wept.



1 Fact,–it occurred in a French family not many years ago.



'At this moment, to the astonishment and terror of all except Walberg, the old man, who, since the night of his wife's interment, had never moved but from his chair to his bed, and that not without assistance, rose suddenly from his seat, and, apparently in obedience to his son, walked with a firm and steady pace towards the door. When he had reached it, he paused, looked back on them with a fruitless effort at recollection, and went out slowly;–and such was the terror felt by all at this last ghastly look, which seemed like that of a corse moving on to the place of its interment, that no one attempted to oppose his passage, and several moments elapsed before Everhard had the recollection to pursue him.

'In the mean time, Ines had dismissed her children, and sitting as near as she dared to the wretched father, attempted to address some soothing expressions to him. Her voice, which was exquisitely sweet and soft, seemed to produce a mechanical effect on him. He turned towards her at first,–then leaning his head on his arm, he shed a few silent tears,–then flinging it on his wife's bosom, he wept aloud. Ines seized this moment to impress on his heart the horror she felt from the outrage he had committed, and adjured him to supplicate the mercy of God for a crime, which, in her eyes, appeared scarce short of parricide. Walberg wildly asked what she alluded to; and when, shuddering, she uttered the words,–'Your father,–your poor old father!'–he smiled with an expression of mysterious and supernatural confidence that froze her blood, and, approaching her ear, softly whispered, 'I have no father! He is dead,–long dead! I buried him the night I dug my mother's grave! Poor old man,' he added with a sigh, 'it was the better for him,–he would have lived only to weep, and perish perhaps with hunger. But I will tell you, Ines,–and let it be a secret, I wondered what made our provisions decrease so, till what was yesterday sufficient for four, is not to-day sufficient for one. I watched, and at last I discovered–it must be a secret–an old goblin, who daily visited this house. It came in the likeness of an old man in rags, and with a long white beard, and it devoured every thing on the table, while the children stood hungry by! But I struck at–I cursed it,–I chased it in the name of the All-powerful, and it is gone. Oh it was a fell devouring goblin!–but it will haunt us no more, and we shall have enough. Enough,' said the wretched man, involuntarily returning to his habitual associations,–'enough for to-morrow!'

'Ines, overcome with horror at this obvious proof of insanity, neither interrupted or opposed him; she attempted only to soothe him, internally praying against the too probable disturbance of her own intellects. Walberg saw her look of distrust, and, with the quick jealousy of partial insanity, said, 'If you do not credit me in that, still less, I suppose, will you in the account of that fearful visitation with which I have latterly been familiar.'–'Oh, my beloved!' said Ines, who recognized in these words the source of a fear that had latterly, from some extraordinary circumstances in her husband's conduct, taken possession of her soul, and made the fear even of famine trifling in comparison,–'I dread lest I understand you too well. The anguish of want and of famine I could have borne,–aye, and seen you bear, but the horrid words you have lately uttered, the horrid thoughts that escape you in your sleep,–when I think on these, and guess at'–'You need not guess,' said Walberg, interrupting her, 'I will tell you all.' And, as he spoke, his countenance changed from its expression of wildness to one of perfect sanity and calm confidence,–his features relaxed, his eye became steady, and his tone firm.–'Every night since our late distresses, I have wandered out in search of some relief, and supplicated every passing stranger;–latterly, I have met every night the enemy of man, who'–'Oh cease, my love, to indulge these horrible thoughts,–they are the results of your disturbed unhappy state of mind.'–'Ines, listen to me. I see that figure as plainly as I see yours,–I hear his voice as distinctly as you hear mine this moment. Want and misery are not naturally fertile in the production of imagination,–they grasp at realities too closely. No man, who wants a meal, conceives that a banquet is spread before him, and that the tempter invites him to sit down and eat at his ease. No,–no, Ines, the evil one, or some devoted agent of his in human form, besets me every night,–and how I shall longer resist the snare, I know not.'–'And in what form does he appear?' said Ines, hoping to turn the channel of his gloomy thoughts, while she appeared to follow their direction. 'In that of a middle-aged man, of a serious and staid demeanour, and with nothing remarkable in his aspect except the light of two burning eyes, whose lustre is almost intolerable. He fixes them on me sometimes, and I feel as if there was fascination in their glare. Every night he besets me, and few like me could have resisted his seductions. He has offered, and proved to me, that it is in his power to bestow all that human cupidity could thirst for, on the condition that–I cannot utter! It is one so full of horror and impiety, that, even to listen to it, is scarce less a crime than to comply with it!'

'Ines, still incredulous, yet imagining that to soothe his delirium was perhaps the best way to overcome it, demanded what that condition was. Though they were alone, Walberg would communicate it only in a whisper; and Ines, fortified as she was by reason hitherto undisturbed, and a cool and steady temper, could not but recollect some vague reports she had heard in her early youth, before she quitted Spain, of a being permitted to wander through it, with power to tempt men under the pressure of extreme calamity with similar offers, which had been invariably rejected, even in the last extremities of despair and dissolution. She was not superstitious,–but, her memory now taking part with her husband's representation of what had befallen him, she shuddered at the possibility of his being exposed to similar temptation; and she endeavoured to fortify his mind and conscience, by arguments equally appropriate whether he was the victim of a disturbed imagination, or the real object of this fearful persecution. She reminded him, that if, even in Spain, where the abominations of Antichrist prevailed, and the triumph of the mother of witchcrafts and spiritual seduction was complete, the fearful offer he alluded to had been made and rejected with such unmitigated abhorrence, the renunciation of one who had embraced the pure doctrines of the gospel should be expressed with a tenfold energy of feeling and holy defiance. 'You,' said the heroic woman, 'you first taught me that the doctrines of salvation are to be found alone in the holy scriptures,–I believed you, and wedded you in that belief. We are united less in the body than in the soul, for in the body neither of us may probably sojourn much longer. You pointed out to me, not the legends of fabulous saints, but the lives of the primitive apostles and martyrs of the true church. There I read no tales of 'voluntary humility,' of self-inflicted, fruitless sufferings, but I read that the people of God were 'destitute, afflicted, tormented.' And shall we dare to murmur at following the examples of those you have pointed out to me as ensamples of suffering? They bore the spoiling of their goods,–they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins,–they resisted unto blood, striving against sin.–And shall we lament the lot that has fallen to us, when our hearts have so often burned within us, as we read the holy records together? Alas! what avails feeling till it is brought to the test of fact? How we deceived ourselves, in believing that we indeed participated in the feelings of those holy men, while we were so far removed from the test by which they were proved! We read of imprisonments, of tortures, and of flames!–We closed the book, and partook of a comfortable meal, and retired to a peaceful bed, triumphing in the thought, while saturated with all the world's good, that if their trials had been ours, we could have sustained those trials as they did. Now, our hour has come,–it is an hour sharp and terrible!'–'It is!' murmured the shuddering husband. 'But shall we therefore shrink?' replied his wife. 'Your ancestors, who were the first in Germany that embraced the reformed religion, have bled and blazed for it, as you have often told me,–can there be a stronger attestation to it?'–'I believe there can,' said Walberg, whose eyes rolled fearfully,–'that of starving for it!–Oh Ines,' he exclaimed, as he grasped her hands convulsively, 'I have felt,–I still feel, that a death at the stake would be mercy compared to the lingering tortures of protracted famine,–to the death that we die daily–and yet do not die! What is this I hold?' he exclaimed, grasping unconsciously the hand he held in his. 'It is my hand, my love,' answered the trembling wife.–'Yours!–no–impossible!–Your fingers were soft and cool, but these are dry,–is this a human hand?'–'It is mine,' said the weeping wife. 'Then you must have been famishing,' said Walberg, awakening as if from a dream. 'We have all been so latterly,' answered Ines, satisfied to restore her husband's sanity, even at the expense of this horrible confession,–'We have all been so–but I have suffered the least. When a family is famishing, the children think of their meals–but the mother thinks only of her children. I have lived on as little as–I could,–I had indeed no appetite.'–'Hush,' said Walberg, interrupting her–'what sound was that?–was it not like a dying groan?'–'No–it is the children who moan in their sleep.'–'What do they moan for?' 'Hunger I believe,' said Ines, involuntarily yielding to the dreadful conviction of habitual misery.–'And I sit and hear this,' said Walberg, starting up,–'I sit to hear their young sleep broken by dreams of hunger, while for a word's speaking I could pile this floor with mountains of gold, and all for the risk of–'Of what?'–said Ines, clinging to him,–'of what?–Oh! think of that!–what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?–Oh! let us starve, die, rot before your eyes, rather than you should seal your perdition by that horrible'–'Hear me, woman!' said Walberg, turning on her eyes almost as fierce and lustrous as those of Melmoth, and whose light, indeed, seemed borrowed from his; 'Hear me!–My soul is lost! They who die in the agonies of famine know no God, and want none–if I remain here to famish among my children, I shall as surely blaspheme the Author of my being, as I shall renounce him under the fearful conditions proposed to me!–Listen to me, Ines, and tremble not. To see my children die of famine will be to me instant suicide and impenitent despair! But if I close with this fearful offer, I may yet repent,–I may yet escape!–There is hope on one side–on the other there is none–none–none! Your hands cling round me, but their touch is cold!–You are wasted to a shadow with want! Shew me the means of procuring another meal, and I will spit at the tempter, and spurn him!–But where is that to be found?–Let me go, then, to meet him!–You will pray for me, Ines,–will you not?–and the children?–No, let them not pray for me!–in my despair I forgot to pray myself, and their prayers would now be a reproach to me.–Ines!–Ines!–What? am I talking to a corse?' He was indeed, for the wretched wife had sunk at his feet senseless. 'Thank God!' he again emphatically exclaimed, as he beheld her lie to all appearance lifeless before him. 'Thank God a word then has killed her,–it was a gentler death than famine! It would have been kind to have strangled her with these hands! Now for the children!' he exclaimed, while horrid thoughts chased each other over his reeling and unseated mind, and he imagined he heard the roar of a sea in its full strength thundering in his ears, and saw ten thousand waves dashing at his feet, and every wave of blood. 'Now for the children!'–and he felt about as if for some implement of destruction. In doing so, his left hand crossed his right, and grasping it, he exclaimed as if he felt a sword in his hand,–'This will do–they will struggle–they will supplicate,–but I will tell them their mother lies dead at my feet, and then what can they say? How now,' said the miserable man, sitting calmly down, 'If they cry to me, what shall I answer? Julia, and Ines her mother's namesake,–and poor little Maurice, who smiles even amid hunger, and whose smiles are worse than curses!–I will tell them their mother is dead!' he cried, staggering towards the door of his children's apartment 'Dead without a blow!–that shall be their answer and their doom.'

'As he spoke, he stumbled over the senseless body of his wife; and the tone of his mind once more strung up to the highest pitch of conscious agony, he cried, 'Men!–men!–what are your pursuits and your passions?–your hopes and fears?–your struggles and your triumphs?–Look on me!–learn from a human being like yourselves, who preaches his last and fearful sermon over the corse of his wife, and approaching the bodies of his sleeping children, whom he soon hopes to see corses also–corses made so by his own hand!–Let all the world listen to me!–let them resign factitious wants and wishes, and furnish those who hang on them for subsistence with the means of bare subsistence!–There is no care, no thought beyond this! Let our children call on me for instruction, for promotion, for distinction, and call in vain–I hold myself innocent. They may find those for themselves, or want them if they list–but let them never in vain call on me for bread, as they have done,–as they do now! I hear the moans of their hungry sleep!–World–world, be wise, and let your children curse you to your face for any thing but want of bread! Oh that is the bitterest of curses,–and it is felt most when it is least uttered! I have felt it often, but I shall feel it no longer!'–And the wretch tottered towards the beds of his children.

'Father!–father!' cried Julia, 'are these your hands? Oh let me live, and I will do any thing–any thing but'–'Father!–dear father!' cried Ines, 'spare us!–to-morrow may bring another meal!' Maurice, the young child, sprung from his bed, and cried, clinging round his father, 'Oh, dear father, forgive me!–but I dreamed a wolf was in the room, and was tearing out our throats; and, father, I cried so long, that I thought you never would come. And now–Oh God! oh God!'–as he felt the hands of the frantic wretch grasping his throat,–'are you the wolf?'

'Fortunately those hands were powerless from the very convulsion of the agony that prompted their desperate effort. The daughters had swooned from horror,–and their swoon appeared like death. The child had the cunning to counterfeit death also, and lay extended and stopping his breath under the fierce but faultering gripe that seized his young throat–then relinquished–then grasped it again–and then relaxed its hold as at the expiration of a spasm.

'When all was over, as the wretched father thought, he retreated from the chamber. In doing so, he stumbled over the corse-like form of his wife.–A groan announced that the sufferer was not dead. 'What does this mean?' said Walberg, staggering in his delirium,–'does the corse reproach me for murder?–or does one surviving breath curse me for the unfinished work?'

'As he spoke, he placed his foot on his wife's body. At this moment, a loud knock was heard at the door. 'They are come!' said Walberg, whose frenzy hurried him rapidly through the scenes of an imaginary murder, and the consequence of a judicial process. 'Well!–come in–knock again, or lift the latch–or enter as ye list–here I sit amid the bodies of my wife and children–I have murdered them–I confess it–ye come to drag me to torture, I know–but never–never can your tortures inflict on me more than the agony of seeing them perish by hunger before my eyes. Come in–come in–the deed is done!–The corse of my wife is at my foot, and the blood of my children is on my hands–what have I further to fear?' But while the wretched man spoke thus, he sunk sullenly on his chair, appearing to be employed in wiping from his fingers the traces of blood with which he imagined they were stained. At length the knocking at the door became louder,–the latch was lifted,–and three figures entered the apartment in which Walberg sat. They advanced slowly,–two from age and exhaustion,–and the third from strong emotion. Walberg heeded them not,–his eyes were fixed,–his hands locked in each other;–nor did he move a limb as they approached.

'Do you not know us?' said the foremost, holding up a lantern which he held in his hand. Its light fell on a groupe worthy the pencil of a Rembrandt. The room lay in complete darkness, except where that strong and unbroken light fell. It glared on the rigid and moveless obduracy of Walberg's despair, who appeared stiffening into stone as he sat. It showed the figure of the friendly priest who had been Guzman's director, and whose features, pale and haggard with age and austerities, seemed to struggle with the smile that trembled over their wrinkled lines. Behind him stood the aged father of Walberg, with an aspect of perfect apathy, except when, with a momentary effort at recollection, he shook his white head, seeming to ask himself why he was there–and wherefore he could not speak. Supporting him stood the young form of Everhard, over whose cheek and eye wandered a glow and lustre too bright to last, and instantly succeeded by paleness and dejection. He trembled, advanced,–then shrinking back, clung to his infirm grandfather, as if needing the support he appeared to give. Walberg was the first to break the silence. 'I know ye who ye are,' he said hollowly–'ye are come to seize me–ye have heard my confession–why do you delay? Drag me away–I would rise and follow you if I could, but I feel as if I had grown to this seat–you must drag me from it yourselves.

'As he spoke, his wife, who had remained stretched at his feet, rose slowly but firmly; and, of all that she saw or heard, appearing to comprehend only the meaning of her husband's words, she clasped her arms round him, as if to oppose his being torn from her, and gazed on the groupe with a look of impotent and ghastly defiance. 'Another witness,' cried Walberg, 'risen from the dead against me? Nay, then, it is time to be gone,'–and he attempted to rise. 'Stay, father,' said Everhard, rushing forward and detaining him in his seat; 'stay,–there is good news, and this good priest has come to tell it,–listen to him, father, I cannot speak.'–'You! oh you! Everhard,' answered the father, with a look of mournful reproach, 'you a witness against me too,–I never raised my hand against you!–Those whom I murdered are silent, and will you be my accuser?'

'They all now gathered round him, partly in terror and partly in consolation,–all anxious to disclose to him the tidings with which their hearts were burdened, yet fearful lest the freight might be too much for the frail vessel that rocked and reeled before them, as if the next breeze would be like a tempest to it. At last it burst forth from the priest, who, by the necessities of his profession, was ignorant of domestic feelings, and of the felicities and agonies which are inseparably twined with the fibres of conjugal and parental hearts. He knew nothing of what Walberg might feel as a husband or father,–for he could never be either; but he felt that good news must be good news, into whatever ears they were poured, or by whatever lips they might be uttered. 'We have the will,' he cried abruptly, 'the true will of Guzman. The other was–asking pardon of God and the saints for saying so–no better than a forgery. The will is found, and you and your family are heirs to all his wealth. I was coming to acquaint you, late as it was, having with difficulty obtained the Superior's permission to do so, and in my way I met this old man, whom your son was conducting,–how came he out so late?' At these words Walberg was observed to shudder with a brief but strong spasm. 'The will is found!' repeated the priest, perceiving how little effect the words seemed to have on Walberg,–and he raised his voice to its utmost pitch. 'The will of my uncle is found,' repeated Everhard. 'Found,–found,–found!' echoed the aged grandfather, not knowing what he said, but vaguely repeating the last words he heard, and then looking round as if asking for an explanation of them. 'The will is found, love,' cried Ines, who appeared restored to sudden and perfect consciousness by the sound; 'Do you not hear, love? We are wealthy,–we are happy! Speak to us, love, and do not stare so vacantly,–speak to us!' A long pause followed. At length,–'Who are those?' said Walberg in a hollow voice, pointing to the figures before him, whom he viewed with a fixed and ghastly look, as if he was gazing on a band of spectres. 'Your son, love,–and your father,–and the good friendly priest. Why do you look so doubtfully on us?'–'And what do they come for?' said Walberg. Again and again the import of their communication was told him, in tones that, trembling with varied emotion, scarce could express their meaning. At length he seemed faintly conscious of what was said, and, looking round on them, uttered a long and heavy sigh. They ceased to speak, and watched him in silence.–'Wealth!–wealth!–it comes too late. Look there,–look there!' and he pointed to the room where his children lay.

'Ines, with a dreadful presentiment at her heart, rushed into it, and beheld her daughters lying apparently lifeless. The shriek she uttered, as she fell on the bodies, brought the priest and her son to her assistance, and Walberg and the old man were left together alone, viewing each other with looks of complete insensibility; and this apathy of age, and stupefaction of despair, made a singular contrast with the fierce and wild agony of those who still retained their feelings. It was long before the daughters were recovered from their death-like swoon, and still longer before their father could be persuaded that the arms that clasped him, and the tears that fell on his cold cheek, were those of his living children.

'All that night his wife and family struggled with his despair. At last recollection seemed to burst on him at once. He shed some tears;–then, with a minuteness of reminiscence that was equally singular and affecting, he flung himself before the old man, who, speechless and exhausted, sat passively in his chair, and exclaiming, 'Father, forgive me!' buried his head between his father's knees.

* * * *

'Happiness is a powerful restorative,–in a few days the spirits of all appeared to have subsided into a calm. They wept sometimes, but their tears were no longer painful;–they resembled those showers in a fine spring morning, which announce the increasing warmth and beauty of the day. The infirmities of Walberg's father made the son resolve not to leave Spain till his dissolution, which took place in a few months. He died in peace, blessing and blessed. His son was his only spiritual attendant, and a brief and partial interval of recollection enabled him to understand and express his joy and confidence in the holy texts which were read to him from the scriptures. The wealth of the family had now given them importance; and, by the interest of the friendly priest, the body was permitted to be interred in consecrated ground. The family then set out for Germany, where they reside in prosperous felicity;–but to this hour Walberg shudders with horror when he recals the fearful temptations of the stranger, whom he met in his nightly wanderings in the hour of his adversity, and the horrors of this visitation appear to oppress his recollection more than even the images of his family perishing with want.

'There are other narratives,' continued the stranger, 'relating to this mysterious being, which I am in possession of, and which I have collected with much difficulty; for the unhappy, who are exposed to his temptations, consider their misfortunes as a crime, and conceal, with the most anxious secresy, every circumstance of this horrible visitation. Should we again meet, Senhor, I may communicate them to you, and you will find them no less extraordinary than that I have just related. But it is now late, and you need repose after the fatigue of your journey.'–So saying, the stranger departed.





'Don Francisco remained seated in his chair, musing on the singular tale he had listened to, till the lateness of the hour, combining with his fatigue, and the profound attention he had paid to the narrative of the stranger, plunged him insensibly into a deep slumber. He was awoke in a few minutes by a slight noise in the room, and looking up perceived seated opposite to him another person, whom he never recollected to have seen before, but who was indeed the same who had been refused admittance under the roof of that house the preceding day. He appeared seated perfectly at his ease, however; and to Don Francisco's look of surprise and inquiry, replied that he was a traveller, who had been by mistake shown into that apartment,–that finding its occupant asleep and undisturbed by his entrance, he had taken the liberty of remaining there, but was willing to retire if his presence was considered intrusive.

'As he spoke, Don Francisco had leisure to observe him. There was something remarkable in his expression, though the observer did not find it easy to define what it was; and his manner, though not courtly or conciliating, had an ease which appeared more the result of independence of thought, than of the acquired habitudes of society.

'Don Francisco welcomed him gravely and slowly, not without a sensation of awe for which he could scarcely account;–and the stranger returned the salutation in a manner that was not likely to diminish that impression. A long silence followed. The stranger (who did not announce his name) was the first to break it, by apologizing for having, while seated in an adjacent apartment, involuntarily overheard an extraordinary tale or narrative related to Don Francisco, in which he confessed he took a profound interest, such as (he added, bowing with an air of grim and reluctant civility) would, he trusted, palliate his impropriety in listening to a communication not addressed to him.

'To all this Don Francisco could only reply by bows equally rigid, (his body scarce forming an acute angle with his limbs as he sat), and by looks of uneasy and doubtful curiosity directed towards his strange visitor, who, however, kept his seat immoveably, and seemed, after all his apologies, resolved to sit out Don Francisco.

'Another long pause was broken by the visitor. 'You were listening, I think,' he said, 'to a wild and terrible story of a being who was commissioned on an unutterable errand,–even to tempt spirits in woe, at their last mortal extremity, to barter their hopes of future happiness for a short remission of their temporary sufferings.'–'I heard nothing of that,' said Don Francisco, whose recollection, none of the clearest naturally, was not much improved by the length of the narrative he had just listened to, and by the sleep into which he had fallen since he heard it. 'Nothing?' said the visitor, with something of abruptness and asperity in his tone that made the hearer start–'nothing?–I thought there was mention too of that unhappy being to whom Walberg confessed his severest trials were owing,–in comparison with whose fearful visitations those of even famine were as dust in the balance.'–'Yes, yes,' answered Don Francisco, startled into sudden recollection, 'I remember there was a mention of the devil,–or his agent,–or something'–'Senhor,' said the stranger interrupting him, with an expression of wild and fierce derision, which was lost on Aliaga–'Senhor, I beg you will not confound personages who have the honour to be so nearly allied, and yet so perfectly distinct as the devil and his agent, or agents. You yourself, Senhor, who, of course, as an orthodox and inveterate Catholic, must abhor the enemy of mankind, have often acted as his agent, and yet would be somewhat offended at being mistaken for him.' Don Francisco crossed himself repeatedly, and devoutly disavowed his ever having been an agent of the enemy of man. 'Will you dare to say so?' said his singular visitor, not raising his voice as the insolence of the question seemed to require, but depressing it to the lowest whisper as he drew his seat nearer his astonished companion–'Will you dare to say so?–Have you never erred?–Have you never felt one impure sensation?–Have you never indulged a transient feeling of hatred, or malice, or revenge?–Have you never forgot to do the good you ought to do,–or remembered to do the evil you ought not to have done?–Have you never in trade overreached a dealer, or banquetted on the spoils of your starving debtor?–Have you never, as you went to your daily devotions, cursed from your heart the wanderings of your heretical brethren,–and while you dipped your fingers in the holy water, hoped that every drop that touched your pores, would be visited on them in drops of brimstone and sulphur?–Have you never, as you beheld the famished, illiterate, degraded populace of your country, exulted in the wretched and temporary superiority your wealth has given you,–and felt that the wheels of your carriage would not roll less smoothly if the way was paved with the heads of your countrymen? Orthodox Catholic–old Christian–as you boast yourself to be,–is not this true?–and dare you say you have not been an agent of Satan? I tell you, whenever you indulge one brutal passion, one sordid desire, one impure imagination–whenever you uttered one word that wrung the heart, or embittered the spirit of your fellow-creature–whenever you made that hour pass in pain to whose flight you might have lent wings of down–whenever you have seen the tear, which your hand might have wiped away, fall uncaught, or forced it from an eye which would have smiled on you in light had you permitted it–whenever you have done this, you have been ten times more an agent of the enemy of man than all the wretches whom terror, enfeebled nerves, or visionary credulity, has forced into the confession of an incredible compact with the author of evil, and whose confession has consigned them to flames much more substantial than those the imagination of their persecutors pictured them doomed to for an eternity of suffering! Enemy of mankind!' the speaker continued,–'Alas! how absurdly is that title bestowed on the great angelic chief,–the morning star fallen from its sphere! What enemy has man so deadly as himself? If he would ask on whom he should bestow that title aright, let him smite his bosom, and his heart will answer,–Bestow it here!'

'The emotion with which the stranger spoke, roused and affected even the sluggish and incrusted spirit of the listener. His conscience, like a state coach-horse, had hitherto only been brought on solemn and pompous occasions, and then paced heavily along a smooth and well-prepared course, under the gorgeous trappings of ceremony;–now it resembled the same animal suddenly bestrid by a fierce and vigorous rider, and urged by lash and spur along a new and rugged road. And slow and reluctant as he was to own it, he felt the power of the weight that pressed, and the bit that galled him. He answered by a hasty and trembling renunciation of all engagements, direct or indirect, with the evil power; but he added, that he must acknowledge he had been too often the victim of his seductions, and trusted for the forgiveness of his wanderings to the power of the holy church, and the intercession of the saints.

'The stranger (though he smiled somewhat grimly at this declaration) seemed to accept the concession, and apologized, in his turn, for the warmth with which he had spoken; and which he begged Don Francisco would interpret as a mark of interest in his spiritual concerns. This explanation, though it seemed to commence favourably, was not followed, however, by any attempt at renewed conversation. The parties appeared to stand aloof from each other, till the stranger again alluded to his having overheard the singular conversation and subsequent narrative in Aliaga's apartment. 'Senhor,' he added, in a voice whose solemnity deeply impressed the hearer, wearied as he was,–'I am acquainted with circumstances relating to the extraordinary person who was the daily watcher of Walberg's miseries, and the nightly tempter of his thoughts,–known but to him and me. Indeed I may add, without the imputation of vanity or presumption, that I am as well acquainted as himself with every event of his extraordinary existence; and that your curiosity, if excited at all about him, could be gratified by none so amply and faithfully as by myself.'–'I thank you, Senhor,' answered Don Francisco, whose blood seemed congealing in his veins at the voice and expression of the stranger, he knew not why–'I thank you, but my curiosity has been completely satisfied by the narrative I have already listened to. The night is far spent, and I have to pursue my journey to-morrow; I will therefore defer hearing the particulars you offer to gratify me with till our next meeting.'

'As he spoke, he rose from his seat, hoping that this action would intimate to the intruder, that his presence was no longer desirable. The latter continued, in spite of the intimation, fixed in his seat. At length, starting as if from a trance, he exclaimed, 'When shall our next meeting be?'

'Don Francisco, who did not feel particularly anxious to renew the intimacy, slightly mentioned, that he was on his journey to the neighbourhood of Madrid, where his family, whom he had not seen for many years, resided–that the stages of his journey were uncertain, as he would be obliged to wait for communications from a friend and future relative,–(he alluded to Montilla his intended son-in-law, and as he spoke, the stranger gave a peculiar smile),–and also from certain mercantile correspondents, whose letters were of the utmost importance. Finally, he added, in a disturbed tone, (for the awe of the stranger's presence hung round him like a chilling atmosphere, and seemed to freeze even his words as they issued from his mouth), he could not–easily–tell when he might again have the honour of meeting the stranger. 'You cannot,' said the stranger, rising and drawing his mantle over one shoulder, while his reverted eyes glanced fearfully on the pale auditor–'You cannot,–but I can. Don Francisco di Aliaga, we shall meet tomorrow night!'

'As he spoke, he still continued to stand near the door, fixing on Aliaga eyes whose light seemed to burn more intensely amid the dimness of the wretched apartment. Aliaga had risen also, and was gazing on his strange visitor with dim and troubled vision,–when the latter, suddenly retreating from the door, approached him and said, in a stifled and mysterious whisper, 'Would you wish to witness the fate of those whose curiosity or presumption breaks on the secrets of that mysterious being, and dares to touch the folds of the veil in which his destiny has been enshrouded by eternity? If you do, look here!' And as he spoke, he pointed to a door which Don Francisco well remembered to be that which the person whom he had met at the inn the preceding evening, and who had related to him the tale of Guzman's family, (or rather relatives), had retired by. Obeying mechanically the waving of the arm, and the beckoning of the stranger's awful eye, rather than the impulse of his own will, Aliaga followed him. They entered the apartment; it was narrow, and dark, and empty. The stranger held a candle aloft, whose dim light fell on a wretched bed, where lay what had been the form of a living man within a few hours. 'Look there!' said the stranger; and Aliaga with horror beheld the figure of the being who had been conversing with him the preceding part of that very evening,–extended a corse!

'Advance–look–observe!' said the stranger, tearing off the sheet which had been the only covering of the sleeper who had now sunk into the long and last slumber–'There is no mark of violence, no distortion of feature, or convulsion of limb–no hand of man was on him. He sought the possession of a desperate secret–he obtained it, but he paid for it the dreadful price that can be paid but once by mortals. So perish those whose presumption exceeds their power!'

'Aliaga, as he beheld the body, and heard the words of the stranger, felt himself disposed to summon the inmates of the house, and accuse the stranger of murder; but the natural cowardice of a mercantile spirit, mingled with other feelings which he could not analyse, and dared not own, withheld him,–and he continued to gaze alternately on the corse and the corse-like stranger. The latter, after pointing emphatically to the body, as if intimating the danger of imprudent curiosity, or unavailing disclosure, repeated the words, 'We meet again to-morrow night!' and departed.

'Aliaga, overcome by fatigue and emotion, sunk down by the corse, and remained in that trance-like state till the servants of the inn entered the room. They were shocked to find a dead body in the bed, and scarce less shocked at the death-like state in which they found Aliaga. His known wealth and distinction procured for him those attentions which otherwise their terrors or their suspicions might have withheld. A sheet was cast over the body, and Aliaga was conveyed to another apartment, and attended sedulously by the domestics.

'In the mean time, the Alcaide arrived; and having learned that the person who had died suddenly in the inn was one totally unknown, as being only a writer, and a man of no importance in public or private life, and that the person found near his bed in a passive stupor was a wealthy merchant,–snatched, with some trepidation, the pen from the ink-horn which hung at his button-hole, and sketched the record of this sapient inquest:–'That a guest had died in the house, none could deny; but no one could suspect Don Francisco di Aliaga of murder.'

'As Don Francisco mounted his mule the following day, on the strength of this just verdict, a person, who did not apparently belong to the house, was particularly solicitous in adjusting his stirrups, &c.; and while the obsequious Alcaide bowed oft and profoundly to the wealthy merchant, (whose liberality he had amply experienced for the favourable colour he had given to the strong circumstantial evidence against him), this person whispered, in a voice that reached only the ears of Don Francisco, 'We meet to-night!'

'Don Francisco checked his mule as he heard the words. He looked round him–the speaker was gone. Don Francisco rode on with a feeling known to few, and which those who have felt are perhaps the least willing to communicate.





CHAPTER XXIX







'Don Francisco rode on most of that day. The weather was mild, and his servants holding occasionally large umbrellas over him as he rode, rendered travelling supportable. In consequence of his long absence from Spain, he was wholly unacquainted with his route, and obliged to depend on a guide; and the fidelity of a Spanish guide being as proverbial and trust-worthy as Punic faith, towards evening Don Francisco found himself just where the Princess Micomicona, in the romance of his countryman, is said to have discovered Don Quixote,–'amid a labyrinth of rocks.' He immediately dispatched his attendants in various directions, to discover the track they were to pursue. The guide gallopped after as fast as his wearied mule could go, and Don Francisco, looking round, after a long delay on the part of his attendants, found himself completely alone. Neither the weather nor the prospect was calculated to raise his spirits. The evening was very misty, unlike the brief and brilliant twilight that precedes the nights of the favoured climates of the south. Heavy showers fell from time to time,–not incessant, but seeming like the discharge of passing clouds, that were instantly succeeded by others. Those clouds gathered blacker and deeper every moment, and hung in fantastic wreaths over the stony mountains that formed a gloomy perspective to the eye of the traveller. As the mists wandered over them, they seemed to rise and fade, and shift their shapes and their stations like the hills of Ubeda,1 as indistinct in form and as dim in hue, as the atmospheric illusions which in that dreary and deceptive light sometimes gave them the appearance of primeval mountains, and sometimes that of fleecy and baseless clouds.



1 Vide Cervantes, apud Don Quixote de Collibus Ubedæ.



'Don Francisco at first dropt the reins on his mule's neck, and uttered sundry ejaculations to the Virgin. Finding this did no good,–that the hills still seemed to wander before his bewildered eyes, and the mule, on the other hand, remained immoveable, he bethought himself of calling on a variety of saints, whose names the echoes of the hills returned with the most perfect punctuality, but not one of whom happened just then to be at leisure to attend to his petitions. Finding the case thus desperate, Don Francisco struck spurs into his mule, and gallopped up a rocky defile, where the hoofs of his beast struck fire at every step, and their echo from the rocks of granite made the rider tremble, lest he was pursued by banditti at every step he took. The mule, so provoked, gallopped fiercely on, till the rider, weary as he was, and somewhat incommoded by its speed, drew up the reins more tightly, at hearing the steps of another rider close behind him. The mule paused instantly. Some say that animals have a kind of instinct in discovering and recognizing the approach of beings not of this world. However that may be, Don Francisco's mule stood as if its feet had been nailed to the road, till the approach of the traveller set it once more into a gallop, on which, as it appeared, the gallop of the pursuer, whose course seemed fleeter than that of an earthly rider, gained fast, and in a few moments a singular figure rode close beside Don Francisco.

'He was not in a riding dress, but muffled from head to foot in a long cloke, whose folds were so ample as almost to hide the flanks of his beast. As soon as he was abreast with Aliaga, he removed that part of the cloke which covered his head and shoulders, and, turning towards him, disclosed the unwelcome countenance of his mysterious visitor the preceding night. 'We meet again, Senhor,' said the stranger, with his peculiar smile, 'and fortunately for you, I trust. Your guide has ridden off with the money you advanced him for his services, and your servants are ignorant of the roads, which, in this part of the country, are singularly perplexed. If you will accept of me as your guide, you will, I believe, have reason to congratulate yourself on our encounter.'

'Don Francisco, who felt that no choice was left, acquiesced in silence, and rode on, not without reluctance, by the side of his strange companion. The silence was at length broken, by the stranger's pointing out the village at which Aliaga proposed to pass the night, at no very great distance, and at the same time noticing the approaching of his servants, who were returning to their master, after having made a similar discovery. These circumstances contributing to restore Aliaga's courage, he proceeded with some degree of confidence, and even began to listen with interest to the conversation of the stranger; particularly as he observed, that though the village was near, the windings of the road were likely to retard their arrival for some hours. The interest which had thus been excited, the stranger seemed resolved to improve to the uttermost. He rapidly unfolded the stores of his rich and copiously furnished mind; and, by skilfully blending his displays of general knowledge with particular references to the oriental countries where Aliaga had resided, their commerce, their customs, and their manners, and with a perfect acquaintance with the most minute topics of mercantile discourse,–he so far conciliated his fellow-traveller, that the journey, begun in terror, ended in delight, and Aliaga heard with a kind of pleasure, (not however unmixed with awful reminiscences), the stranger announce his intention of passing the night at the same inn.

'During the supper, the stranger redoubled his efforts, and confirmed his success. He was indeed a man who could please when he pleased, and whom. His powerful intellects, extensive knowledge, and accurate memory, qualified him to render the hour of companionship delightful to all whom genius could interest, or information amuse. He possessed a fund of anecdotical history, and, from the fidelity of his paintings, always appeared himself to have been an agent in the scenes he described. This night, too, that the attractions of his conversation might want no charm, and have no shade, he watchfully forbore those bursts of passion,–those fierce explosions of misanthropy and malediction, and that bitter and burning irony with which, at other times, he seemed to delight to interrupt himself and confound his hearer.

'The evening thus passed pleasurably; and it was not till supper was removed, and the lamp placed on the table beside which the stranger and he were seated alone, that the ghastly scene of the preceding night rose like a vision before the eyes of Aliaga. He thought he saw the corse lying in a corner of the room, and waving its dead hand, as if to beckon him away from the society of the stranger. The vision passed away,–he looked up,–they were alone. It was with the utmost effort of his mixed politeness and fear, that he prepared himself to listen to the tale which the stranger had frequently, amid their miscellaneous conversation, alluded to, and showed an evident anxiety to relate.

'These allusions were attended with unpleasant reminiscences to the hearer,–but he saw that it was to be, and armed himself as he might with courage to hear. 'I would not intrude on you, Senhor,' said the stranger, with an air of grave interest which Aliaga had never seen him assume before–'I would not intrude on you with a narrative in which you can feel but little interest, were I not conscious that its relation may operate as a warning the most awful, salutary, and efficacious to yourself.'–'Me!' exclaimed Don Francisco, revolting with all the horror of an orthodox Catholic at the sound.–'Me!' he repeated, uttering a dozen ejaculations to the saints, and making the sign of the cross twice that number of times.–'Me!' he continued, discharging a whole volley of fulmination against all those who, being entangled in the snares of Satan, sought to draw others into them, whether in the shape of heresy, witchcraft, or otherwise. It might be observed, however, that he laid most stress on heresy, the latter evil, from the rigour of their mythology, or other causes, which it were not unworthy philosophical curiosity to inquire into, being almost unknown in Spain;–and he uttered this protestation (which was doubtless very sincere) with such a hostile and denunciatory tone, that Satan, if he was present, (as the speaker half imagined), would have been almost justified in making reprisals. Amid the assumed consequence which passion, whether natural or artificial, always gives to a man of mediocrity, he felt himself withering in the wild laugh of the stranger. 'You,–you!' he exclaimed, after a burst of sound that seemed rather like the convulsion of a demoniac, than the mirth, however frantic, of a human being–'you!–oh, there's metal more attractive! Satan himself, however depraved, has a better taste than to crunch such a withered scrap of orthodoxy as you between his iron teeth. No!–the interest I alluded to as possible for you to feel, refers to another one, for whom you ought to feel if possible more than for yourself. Now, worthy Aliaga, your personal fears being removed, sit and listen to my tale. You are sufficiently acquainted, through the medium of commercial feelings, and the general information which your habits have forced on you, with the history and manners of those heretics who inhabit the country called England.'

'Don Francisco, as a merchant, avouched his knowledge of their being fair dealers, and wealthy liberal speculators in trade; but (crossing himself frequently) he pronounced his utter detestation of them as enemies to the holy church, and implored the stranger to believe that he would rather renounce the most advantageous contract he had ever made with them in the mercantile line, than be suspected of–'I suspect nothing,' said the stranger, interrupting him, with that smile that spoke darker and bitterer things than the fiercest frown that ever wrinkled the features of man.–'Interrupt me no more,–listen, as you value the safety of a being of more value than all your race beside. You are acquainted tolerably with the English history, and manners, and habits; the latter events of their history are indeed in the mouths of all Europe.' Aliaga was silent, and the stranger proceeded.



The Lovers' Tale



'In a part of that heretic country lies a portion of land they call Shropshire, ('I have had dealings with Shrewsbury merchants,' said Aliaga to himself, 'they furnished goods, and paid bills with distinguished punctuality,')–there stood Mortimer Castle, the seat of a family who boasted of their descent from the age of the Norman Conqueror, and had never mortgaged an acre, or cut down a tree, or lowered a banner on their towers at the approach of a foe, for five hundred years. Mortimer castle had held out during the wars of Stephen and Matilda,–it had even defied the powers that summoned it to capitulation alternately, (about once a week), during the struggle between the houses of York and Lancaster,–it had also disdained the summons of Richard and Richmond, as their successive blasts shook its battlements, while the armies of the respective leaders advanced to the field of Bosworth. The Mortimer family, in fact, by their power, their extensive influence, their immense wealth, and the independency of their spirit, had rendered themselves formidable to every party, and superior to all.

'At the time of the Reformation, Sir Roger Mortimer, the descendant of this powerful family, vigorously espoused the cause of the Reformers; and when the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood sent their usual dole, at Christmas, of beef and ale to their tenants, Sir Roger, with his chaplain attending him, went about from cottage to cottage, distributing Bibles in English, of the edition printed by Tyndal in Holland. But his loyalism prevailed so far, that he circulated along with them the uncouth print, cut out of his own copy, of the King (Henry VIII.) dispensing copies of the Bible from both hands, which the people, as represented in the engraving, caught at with theirs, and seemed to devour as the word of life, almost before it could reach them.

'In the short reign of Edward, the family was protected and cherished; and the godly Sir Edmund, son and successor to Sir Roger, had the Bible laid open in his hall window, that while his domestics passed on their errands, as he expressed himself,–'he that runs may read.' In that of Mary, they were oppressed, confiscated, and menaced. Two of their servants were burned at Shrewsbury; and it was said that nothing but a large sum, advanced to defray the expenses of the entertainments made at Court on the arrival of Philip of Spain, saved the godly Sir Edmund from the same fate.

'Sir Edmund, to whatever cause he owed his safety, did not enjoy it long. He had seen his faithful and ancient servants brought to the stake, for the opinions he had taught them,–he had attended them in person to the awful spot, and seen the Bibles he had attempted to place in their hands flung into the flames, as they were kindled round them,–he had turned with tottering steps from the scene, but the crowd, in the triumph of their barbarity, gathered round, and kept him close, so that he not only involuntarily witnessed the whole spectacle, but felt the very heat of the flames that were consuming the bodies of the sufferers. Sir Edmund returned to Mortimer Castle, and died.

'His successor, during the reign of Elizabeth, stoutly defended the rights of the Reformers, and sometimes grumbled at those of prerogative. These grumblings were said to have cost him dear–the court of purveyors charged him £3000, an enormous sum in those days, for an expected visit of the Queen and her court–a visit which was never paid. The money was, however, paid; and it was said that Sir Orlan de Mortimer raised part of the money by disposing of his falcons, the best in England, to the Earl of Leicester, the then favourite of the Queen.' At all events, there was a tradition in the family, that when, on his last ride through his territorial demesne, Sir Orlando saw his favourite remaining bird fly from the falconer's hand, and break her jesses, he exclaimed, 'Let her fly; she knows the way to my lord of Leicester's.'

'During the reign of James, the Mortimer family took a more decided part. The influence of the Puritans (whom James hated with a hatred passing that of even a controversialist, and remembered with pardonable filial resentment, as the inveterate enemies of his ill-fated mother) was now increasing every hour. Sir Arthur Mortimer was standing by King James at the first representation of 'Bartholomew Fair,' written by Ben Jonson, when the prologue uttered these words:1



'Your Majesty is welcome to a Fair;

Such place, such men, such language, and such ware,

You must expect–with these the zealous noise

Of your land's faction, scandalized at toys.'



1 Vide Jonson's play, in which is introduced a Puritan preacher, a Banbury man, named Zeal-of-the-land Busy.



'My lord,' said the King, (for Sir Arthur was one of the lords of the privy council), 'how deem you by that?'–'Please your Majesty,' answered Sir Arthur, 'those Puritans, as I rode to London, cut off mine horse's tail, as they said the ribbons with which it was tied savoured too much of the pride of the beast on which the scarlet whore sits. Pray God their shears may never extend from the tails of horses to the heads of kings!' And as he spoke with affectionate and ominous solicitude, he happened to place his hand on the head of Prince Charles, (afterwards Charles I.), who was sitting next his brother Henry, Prince of Wales, and to whom Sir Arthur Mortimer had had the high honour to be sponsor, as proxy for a sovereign prince.

'The awful and troubled times which Sir Arthur had predicted soon arrived, though he did not live to witness them. His son, Sir Roger Mortimer, a man lofty alike in pride and in principle, and immoveable in both,–an Arminian in creed, and an aristocrat in politics,–the zealous friend of the misguided Laud, and the bosom-companion of the unfortunate Strafford,–was among the first to urge King Charles to those high-handed and impolitic measures, the result of which was so fatal.

'When the war broke out between the King and the Parliament, Sir Roger espoused the royal cause with heart and hand,–raised a large sum in vain, to prevent the sale of the crown-jewels in Holland,–and led five hundred of his tenants, armed at his own expence, to the battles of Edge-hill and Marston-moor.

'His wife was dead, but his sister, Mrs Ann Mortimer, a woman of uncommon beauty, spirit, and dignity of character, and as firmly attached as her brother to the cause of the court, of which she had been once the most brilliant ornament, presided over his household, and by her talents, courage, and promptitude, had been of considerable service to the cause.

'The time came, however, when valour and rank, and loyalty and beauty, found all their efforts ineffectual; and of the five hundred brave men that Sir Roger had led into the field to his sovereign's aid, he brought back thirty maimed and mutilated veterans to Mortimer Castle, on the disastrous day that King Charles was persuaded to put himself into the hands of the disaffected and mercenary Scots, who sold him for their arrears of pay due by the Parliament.

'The reign of rebellion soon commenced,–and Sir Roger, as a distinguished loyalist, felt the severest scourge of its power. Sequestrations and compositions,–fines for malignancy, and forced loans for the support of a cause he detested,–drained the well-filled coffers, and depressed the high spirit, of the aged loyalist. Domestic inquietude was added to his other calamities. He had three children.–His eldest son had fallen fighting in the King's cause at the battle of Newbury, leaving an infant daughter, then supposed the heiress of immense wealth. His second son had embraced the Puritanic cause, and, lapsing from error to error, married the daughter of an Independent, whose creed he had adopted; and, according to the custom of those days, fought all day at the head of his regiment, and preached and prayed to them all night, in strict conformity with that verse in the psalms, which served him alternately for his text and his battle-word–'Let the praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hands.' This double exercise of the sword and the word, however, proved too much for the strength of the saint-militant; and after having, during Cromwell's Irish campaign, vigorously headed the attack on Cloghan Castle,1 the ancient seat of the O'Moores, princes of Leix,–and being scalded through his buff-coat by a discharge of hot water from the bartizan,–and then imprudently given the word of exhortation for an hour and forty minutes to his soldiers, on the bare heath that surrounded the castle, and under a drenching rain,–he died of a pleurisy in three days, and left, like his brother, an infant daughter who had remained in England, and had been educated by her mother. It was said in the family, that this man had written the first lines of Milton's poem 'on the new forcers of conscience under the Long Parliament.' It is certain, at least, that when the fanatics who surrounded his dying bed were lifting up their voices to sing a hymn, he thundered with his last breath,



'Because ye have thrown off your prelate lord,

And with stiff vows renounce his Liturgy,

To seize the widowed w–-e pluralitie,

From them whose sin ye envied not, abhorr'd,' &c.'



1 I have been an inmate in this castle for many months–it is still inhabited by the venerable descendant of that ancient family. His son is now High-Sheriff of the King's county. Half the castle was battered down by Oliver Cromwell's forces, and rebuilt in the reign of Charles the Second. The remains of the castle are a tower of about forty feet square, and five stories high, with a single spacious apartment on each floor, and a narrow staircase communicating with each, and reaching to the bartizan. A beautiful ash-plant, which I have often admired, is now displaying its foliage between the stones of the bartizan,–and how it got or grew there, heaven only knows. There it is, however; and it is better to see it there than to feel the discharge of hot water or molten lead from the apertures.



'Sir Roger felt, though from different causes, pretty much the same degree of emotion on the deaths of his two sons. He was fortified against affliction at the death of the elder, from the consolation afforded him by the cause in which he had fallen; and that in which the apostate, as his father always called him, had perished, was an equal preventive against his feeling any deep or bitter grief on his dissolution.

'When his eldest son fell in the royal cause, and his friends gathered round him in officious condolence, the old loyalist replied, with a spirit worthy of the proudest days of classic heroism, 'It is not for my dead son that I should weep, but for my living one.' His tears, however, were flowing at that time for another cause.

'His only daughter, during his absence, in spite of the vigilance of Mrs Ann, had been seduced by some Puritan servants in a neighbouring family, to hear an Independent preacher of the name of Sandal, who was then a Serjeant in Colonel Pride's regiment, and who was preaching in a barn in the neighbourhood, in the intervals of his military exercises. This man was a natural orator, and a vehement enthusiast; and, with the license of the day, that compromised between a pun and a text, and delighted in the union of both, this serjeant-preacher had baptized himself by the name of–'Thou-art-not-worthy-to-unloose-the-latchets-of-his-shoes,– Sandal.'

'This was the text on which he preached, and his eloquence had such effect on the daughter of Sir Roger Mortimer, that, forgetting the dignity of her birth, and the loyalty of her family, she united her destiny with this low-born man; and, believing herself to be suddenly inspired from this felicitous conjunction, she actually out-preached two female Quakers in a fortnight after their marriage, and wrote a letter (very ill-spelled) to her father, in which she announced her intention to 'suffer affliction with the people of God,' and denounced his eternal damnation, if he declined embracing the creed of her husband; which creed was changed the following week, on his hearing a sermon from the celebrated Hugh Peters, and a month after, on hearing an itinerant preacher of the Ranters or Antinomians, who was surrounded by a troop of licentious, half-naked, drunken disciples, whose vociferations of–'We are the naked truth,' completely silenced a fifth-monarchy man, who was preaching from a tub on the other side of the road. To this preacher Sandal was introduced, and being a man of violent passions, and unsettled principles, he instantly embraced the opinions of the last speaker, (dragging his wife along with him into every gulph of polemical or political difficulty he plunged in), till he happened to hear another preacher of the Cameronians, whose constant topic, whether of triumph or of consolation, was the unavailing efforts made in the preceding reign, to force the Episcopalian system down the throats of the Scots; and, in default of a text, always repeated the words of Archy, jester to Charles the First, who, on the first intimation of the reluctance of the Scots to admit Episcopal jurisdiction, exclaimed to Archbishop Laud, 'My Lord, who is the fool now?'–for which he had his coat stripped over his head, and was forbid the court. So Sandal vacillated between creed and creed, between preacher and preacher, till he died, leaving his widow with one son. Sir Roger announced to his widowed daughter, his determined purpose never to see her more, but he promised his protection to her son, if entrusted to his care. The widow was too poor to decline compliance with the offer of her deserted father.

'So in Mortimer Castle were, in their infancy, assembled the three grandchildren, born under such various auspices and destinies. Margaret Mortimer the heiress, a beautiful, intelligent, spirited girl, heiress of all the pride, aristocratical principle, and possible wealth of the family; Elinor Mortimer, the daughter of the Apostate, received rather than admitted into the house, and educated in all the strictness of her Independent family; and John Sandal, the son of the rejected daughter, whom Sir Roger admitted into the Castle only on the condition of his being engaged in the service of the royal family, banished and persecuted as they were; and he renewed his correspondence with some emigrant loyalists in Holland, for the establishment of his protegé, whom he described, in language borrowed from the Puritan preachers, as 'a brand snatched from the burning.'

'While matters were thus at the Castle, intelligence arrived of Monk's unexpected exertions in favour of the banished family. The result was as rapid as it was auspicious. The Restoration took place within a few days after, and the Mortimer family were then esteemed of so much consequence, that an express, girthed from his waist to his shoulders, was dispatched from London to announce the intelligence. He arrived when Sir Roger, whose chaplain he had been compelled by the ruling party to dismiss as a malignant, was reading prayers himself to his family. The return and restoration of Charles the Second was announced. The old loyalist rose from his knees, waved his cap, (which he had reverently taken from his white head), and, suddenly changing his tone of supplication for one of triumph, exclaimed, 'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!' As he spoke, the old man sunk on the cushion which Mrs Ann had placed beneath his knees. His grandchildren rose from their knees to assist him,–it was too late,–his spirit had parted in that last exclamation.



CHAPTER XXX



–She sat, and thought
Of what a sailor suffers.
 
COWPER


'The intelligence that was the cause of old Sir Roger's death, who might be said to be conducted from this world to the next by a blessed euthanasia, (a kind of passing with a light and lofty step from a narrow entry to a spacious and glorious apartment, without ever feeling he trod the dark and rugged threshold that lies between), was the signal and pledge to this ancient family of the restitution of their faded honours, and fast-declining possessions. Grants, reversals of fines, restoration of land and chattels, and offers of pensions, and provisions, and remunerations, and all that royal gratitude, in the effervescence of its enthusiasm, could bestow, came showering on the Mortimer family, as fast and faster than fines, confiscations, and sequestrations, had poured on them in the reign of the usurper. In fact, the language of King Charles to the Mortimers was like that of the Eastern monarchs to their favourites,–'Ask what thou wilt, and it shall be granted to thee, even to the half of my kingdom.' The Mortimers asked only for their own,–and being thus more reasonable, both in their expectations and demands, than most other applicants at that period, they succeeded in obtaining what they required.

'Thus Mrs Margaret Mortimer (so unmarried females were named at the date of the narrative) was again acknowledged as the wealthy and noble heiress of the Castle. Numerous invitations were sent to her to visit the court, which, though recommended by letters from divers of the court-ladies, who had been acquainted, traditionally at least, with her family, and enforced by a letter from Catherine of Braganza, written by her own hand, in which she acknowledged the obligations of the king to the house of Mortimer, were steadily rejected by the high-minded heiress of its honours and its spirit.–'From these towers,' said she to Mrs Ann, 'my grandfather led forth his vassals and tenants in aid of his king,–to these towers he led what was left of them back, when the royal cause seemed lost for ever. Here he lived and died for his sovereign,–and here will I live and die. And I feel that I shall do more effectual service to his Majesty, by residing on my estates, and protecting my tenants, and repairing,'–she added with a smile,–'even with my needle, the rents made in the banners of our house by many a Puritan's bullet, than if I flaunted it in Hyde-Park in my glass coach, or masqueraded it all night in that of St James's,1 even though I were sure to encounter the Duchess of Cleveland on one side, and Louise de Querouaille on the other,–fitter place for them than me.'–And so saying, Mrs Margaret Mortimer resumed her tapestry work. Mrs Ann looked at her with an eye that spoke volumes,–and the tear that trembled in it made the lines more legible.



1 See a comedy of Wycherly's, entitled, 'Love in a Wood, or St James's Park,' where the company are represented going there at night in masks, and with torches.



'After the decided refusal of Mrs Margaret Mortimer to go to London, the family resumed their former ancestorial habits of stately regularity, and decorous grandeur, such as became a magnificent and well-ordered household, of which a noble maiden was the head and president. But this regularity was without rigour, and this monotony without apathy–the minds of these highly fated females were too familiar with trains of lofty thinking, and images of noble deeds, to sink into vacancy, or feel depression from solitude. I behold them,' said the stranger, 'as I once saw them, seated in a vast irregularly shaped apartment, wainscotted with oak richly and quaintly carved, and as black as ebony–Mrs Ann Mortimer, in a recess which terminated in an ancient casement window, the upper panes of which were gorgeously emblazoned with the arms of the Mortimers, and some legendary atchievements of the former heroes of the family. A book she valued much1 lay on her knee, on which she fixed her eyes intently–the light that came through the casement chequering its dark lettered pages with hues of such glorious and fantastic colouring, that they resembled the leaves of some splendidly-illuminated missal, with all its pomp of gold, and azure, and vermilion.



1 Taylor's Book of Martyrs.



'At a little distance sat her two grand-nieces, employed in work, and relieving their attention to it by conversation, for which they had ample materials. They spoke of the poor whom they had visited and assisted,–of the rewards they had distributed among the industrious and orderly,–and of the books which they were studying; and of which the well-filled shelves of the library furnished them with copious and noble stores.

'Sir Roger had been a man of letters as well as of arms. He had been often heard to say, that next to a well-stocked armoury in time of war, was a well-stocked library in time of peace; and even in the midst of his latter grievances and privations, he contrived every year to make an addition to his own.

'His grand-daughters, well instructed by him in the French and Latin languages, had read Mezeray, Thuanus, and Sully. In English, they had Froissart in the black-letter translation of Pynson, imprinted 1525. Their poetry, exclusive of the classics, consisted chiefly of Waller, Donne, and that constellation of writers that illuminated the drama in the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth, and the commencement of that of James,–Marlow, and Massinger, and Shirley, and Ford–cum multis aliis. Fairfax's translations had made them familiar with the continental poets; and Sir Roger had consented to admit, among his modern collection, the Latin poems (the only ones then published) of Milton, for the sake of that in Quintum Novembris,–for Sir Roger, next to the fanatics, held the Catholics in utter abomination.'

'Then he will be damned to all eternity,' said Aliaga, 'and that's some satisfaction.'

'Thus their retirement was not inelegant, nor unaccompanied with those delights at once soothing and elating, which arise from a judicious mixture of useful occupation and literary tastes.

'On all they read or conversed of, Mrs Ann Mortimer was a living comment. Her conversation, rich in anecdote, and accurate to minuteness, sometimes rising to the loftiest strains of eloquence, as she related 'deeds of the days of old,' and often borrowing the sublimity of inspiration, as the reminiscences of religion softened and solemnized the spirit with which she spake,–like the influence of time on fine paintings, that consecrates the tints it mellows, and makes the colours it has half obscured more precious to the eye of feeling and of taste, than they were in the glow of their early beauty,–her conversation was to her grand-nieces at once history and poetry.

'The events of English history then not recorded, had a kind of traditional history more vivid, if not so faithful as the records of modern historians, in the memories of those who had been agents and sufferers (the terms are probably synonimous) in those memorable periods.

'There was an entertainment then, banished by modern dissipation now, but alluded to by the great poet of that nation, whom your orthodox and undeniable creed justly devotes to eternal damnation.



'In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire,

* * * *

–and tell the tales

Of woful ages long ago betid;

And send the hearers weeping to their beds.

* * * *

We cited up a thousand heavy times.'

* * * *

'When memory thus becomes the depository of grief, how faithfully is the charge kept!–and how much superior are the touches of one who paints from the life, and the heart, and the senses,–to those of one who dips his pen in his ink-stand, and casts his eye on a heap of musty parchments, to glean his facts or his feelings from them! Mrs Ann Mortimer had much to tell,–and she told it well. If history was the subject, she could relate the events of the civil wars–events which resembled indeed those of all civil wars, but which derived a peculiar strength of character, and brilliancy of colouring, from the hand by which they were sketched. She told of the time when she rode behind her brother, Sir Roger, to meet the King at Shrewsbury; and she almost echoed the shout uttered in the streets of that loyal city, when the University of Oxford sent in its plate to be coined for the exigences of the royal cause. She told also, with grave humour, the anecdote of Queen Henrietta making her escape with some difficulty from a house on fire,–and, when her life was scarce secure from the flames that consumed it, rushing back among them–to save her lap-dog!

'But of all her historical anecdotes, Mrs Ann valued most what she had to relate of her own family. On the virtue and valour of her brother Sir Roger, she dwelt with an unction whose balm imparted itself to her hearers; and even Elinor, in spite of the Puritanism of her early principles, wept as she listened. But when Mrs Ann told of the King taking shelter for one night in the Castle, under the protection only of her mother and herself, to whom he intrusted his rank and his misfortunes, (arriving under a disguise),–(Sir Roger being absent fighting his battles in Yorkshire)–when she added that her aged mother, Lady Mortimer, then seventy-four, after spreading her richest velvet mantle, lined with fur, as a quilt for the bed of her persecuted sovereign, tottered into the armoury, and, presenting the few servants that followed her with what arms could be found, adjured them by brand and blade, by lady's love, and their hopes of heaven, to defend her royal guest. When she related that a band of fanatics, after robbing a church of all its silver-plate, and burning the adjacent vicarage, drunk with their success, had invested the Castle, and cried aloud for 'the man' to be brought unto them, that he might be hewed to pieces before the Lord in Gilgal–and Lady Mortimer had called on a young French officer in Prince Rupert's corps, who, with his men, had been billetted on the Castle for some days–and that this youth, but seventeen years of age, had met two desperate attacks of the assailants, and twice retired covered with his own blood and that of the assailants, whom he had in vain attempted to repel–and that Lady Mortimer, finding all was lost, had counselled the royal fugitive to make his escape,–and furnished him with the best horse left in Sir Roger's stables to effect his flight, while she returned to the great hall, whose windows were now shattered by the balls that hissed and flew round her head, and whose doors were fast yielding to the crows and other instruments which a Puritan smith, who was both chaplain and colonel of the band, had lent them, and instructed them in the use of–and how Lady Mortimer fell on her knees before the young Frenchman, and adjured him to make good the defence till King Charles was safe, and free, and far–and how the young Frenchman had done all that man could do;–and finally, when the Castle, after an hour's obstinate resistance, yielded to the assault of the fanatics, he had staggered, covered with blood, to the foot of the great chair which that ancient lady had immoveably occupied, (paralyzed by terror and exhaustion), and dropping his sword, then for the first time, exclaimed, 'J'ai fait mon devoir!' and expired at her feet–and how her mother sat in the same rigour of attitude, while the fanatics ravaged through the Castle,–drank half the wines in the cellar,–thrust their bayonets through the family-pictures, which they called the idols of the high-places,–fired bullets through the wainscot, and converted half the female servants after their own way,–and on finding their search after the King fruitless, in mere wantonness of mischief, were about to discharge a piece of ordnance in the hall that must have shattered it in pieces, while Lady Mortimer sat torpidly looking on,–till, perceiving that the piece was accidentally pointed towards the very door through which King Charles had passed from the hall, her recollection seemed suddenly to return, and starting up and rushing before the mouth of the piece, exclaimed, 'Not there!–you shall not there!'–and as she spoke, dropt dead in the hall. When Mrs Ann told these and other thrilling tales of the magnanimity, the loyalty, and the sufferings of her high ancestry, in a voice that alternately swelled with energy, and trembled with emotion, and as she told them, pointed to the spot where each had happened,–her young hearers felt a deep stirring of the heart,–a proud yet mellowed elation that never yet was felt by the reader of a written history, though its pages were as legitimate as any sanctioned by the royal licenser at Madrid.

'Nor was Mrs Ann Mortimer less qualified to take an interesting share in their lighter studies. When Waller's poetry was its subject, she could tell of the charms of his Sacharissa, whom she knew well,–the Lady Dorothea Sidney, daughter of the Earl of Leicester,–and compare, with those of his Amoret, the Lady Sophia Murray. And in balancing the claims of these poetical heroines, she gave so accurate an account of their opposite styles of beauty,–entered so minutely into the details of their dress and deportment,–and so affectingly hinted, with a mysterious sigh, that there was one then at court whom Lucius, Lord Falkland, the gallant, the learned, and the polished, had whispered was far superior to both,–that her auditors more than suspected she had herself been one of the most brilliant stars in that galaxy whose faded glories were still reflected in her memory,–and that Mrs Ann, amid her piety and patriotism, still blended a fond reminiscence of the gallantries of that court where her youth had been spent,–and over which the beauty, the magnificent taste, and national gaiete of the ill-fated Henrietta, had once thrown a light as dazzling as it was transient. She was listened to by Margaret and Elinor with equal interest, but with far different feelings. Margaret, beautiful, vivacious, haughty, and generous, and resembling her grandfather and his sister alike in character and person, could have listened for ever to narrations that, while they confirmed her principles, gave a kind of holiness to the governing feelings of her heart, and made her enthusiasm a kind of virtue in her eyes. An aristocrat in politics, she could not conceive that public virtue could soar to a higher pitch than a devoted attachment to the house of Stuart afforded for its flight; and her religion had never given her any disturbance.–Strictly attached to the Church of England, as her forefathers had been from its first establishment, she included in an adherence to this not only all the graces of religion, but all the virtues of morality; and she could hardly conceive how there could be majesty in the sovereign, or loyalty in the subject, or valour in man, or virtue in woman, unless they were comprised within the pale of the Church of England. These qualities, with their adjuncts, had been always represented to her as co-existent with an attachment to monarchy and Episcopacy, and vested solely in those heroic characters of her ancestry, whose lives, and even deaths, it was a proud delight to their young descendant to listen to,–while all the opposite qualities,–all that man can hate, or woman despise,–had been represented to her as instinctively resident in the partizans of republicanism and the Presbytery. Thus her feelings and her principles,–her reasoning powers and the habits of her life, all took one way; and she was not only unable to make the least allowance for a divergence from this way, but utterly unable to conceive that another existed for those who believed in a God, or acknowledged human power at all. She was as much at a loss to conceive how any good could come out of that Nazareth of her abhorrence, as an ancient geographer would have been to have pointed out America in a classical map.–Such was Margaret.

'Elinor, on the other hand, bred up amid a clamour of perpetual contention,–for the house of her mother's family, in which her first years had been passed, was, in the language of the profane of those times, a scruple-shop, where the godly of all denominations held their conferences of contradiction,–had her mind early awakened to differences of opinion, and opposition of principle. Accustomed to hear these differences and oppositions often expressed with the most unruly vehemence, she had never, like Margaret, indulged in a splendid aristocracy of imagination, that bore every thing before it, and made prosperity and adversity alike pay tribute to the pride of its triumph. Since her admission into the house of her grandfather, the mind of Elinor had become still more humble and patient,–more subdued and self-denied. Compelled to hear the opinions she was attached to decried, and the characters she reverenced vilified, she sat in reflective silence; and, balancing the opposite extremes which she was destined to witness, she came to the right conclusion,–that there must be good on both sides, however obscured or defaced by passion and by interest, and that great and noble qualities must exist in either party, where so much intellectual power, and so much physical energy, had been displayed by both. Nor could she believe that these clear and mighty spirits would be for ever opposed to each other in their future destinations,–she loved to view them as children who had 'fallen out by the way,' from mistaking the path that led to their father's house, but who would yet rejoice together in the light of his presence, and smile at the differences that divided them on their journey.

'In spite of the influence of her early education, Elinor had learned to appreciate the advantages of her residence in her grandfather's castle. She was fond of literature and of poetry. She possessed imagination and enthusiasm,–and these qualities met with their loveliest indulgence amid the picturesque and historical scenery that surrounded the Castle,–the lofty tales told within its walls, and to which every stone in them seemed to cry out in attestation,–and the heroic and chivalrous characters of its inmates, with whom the portraits of their high descended ancestry seemed starting from their gorgeous frames to converse, as the tale of their virtues and their valour was told in their presence. This was a different scene from that in which she had passed her childhood. The gloomy and narrow apartments, divested of all ornament, and awaking no associations but those of an awful futurity–the uncouth habits, austere visages, denunciatory language, and polemical fury of its inmates or guests, struck her with a feeling for which she reproached herself, but did not suppress; and though she continued a rigid Calvinist in her creed, and listened whenever she could to the preaching of the non-conformist ministers, she had adopted in her pursuits the literary tastes, and in her manners the dignified courtesy, that became the descendant of the Mortimers.

'Elinor's beauty, though of a style quite different from that of her cousin, was yet beauty of the first and finest character. Margaret's was luxuriant, lavish, and triumphant,–every movement displayed a conscious grace,–every look demanded homage, and obtained it the moment it was demanded. Elinor's was pale, contemplative, and touching;–her hair was as black as jet, and the thousand small curls into which, according to the fashion of the day, it was woven, seemed as if every one of them had been twined by the hand of nature,–they hung so softly and shadowingly, that they appeared like a veil dropping over the features of a nun, till she shook them back, and there beamed among them an eye of dark and brilliant light, like a star amid the deepening shades of twilight. She wore the rich dress prescribed by the taste and habits of Mrs Ann, who had never, even in the hour of extreme adversity, relaxed in what may be called the rigour of her aristocratical costume, and would have thought it little less than a desecration of the solemnity, had she appeared at prayers, even though celebrated (as she loved to term it) in the Castle-hall, unless arrayed in satins and velvets, that, like ancient suits of armour, could have stood alone and erect without the aid of human inhabitant. There was a soft and yielding tone in the gently modulated harmony of Elinor's form and movements,–a gracious melancholy in her smile,–a tremulous sweetness in her voice,–an appeal in her look, which the heart that refused to answer could not have living pulse within its region. No head of Rembrandt's, amid its contrasted luxuries of light and shade,–no form of Guido's, hovering in exquisite and speechful undulation between earth and heaven, could vie with the tint and character of Elinor's countenance and form. There was but one touch to be added to the picture of her beauty, and that touch was given by no physical grace,–no exterior charm. It was borrowed from a feeling as pure as it was intense,–as unconscious as it was profound. The secret fire that lit her eyes with that lambent glory, while it caused the paleness of her young cheek,–that preyed on her heart, while it seemed to her imagination that she clasped a young cherub in her arms, like the unfortunate queen of Virgil,–that fire was a secret even to herself.–She knew she felt, but knew not what she felt.

'When first admitted into the Castle, and treated with sufficient hauteur by her grandfather and his sister, who could not forget the mean descent and fanatic principles of her father's family, she remembered, that, amid the appalling grandeur and austere reserve of her reception, her cousin, John Sandal, was the only one who spoke to her in accents of tenderness, or turned on her an eye that beamed consolation. She remembered him as the beautiful and gentle boy who had lightened all her tasks, and partaken in all her recreations.

'At an early age John Sandal, at his own request, had been sent to sea, and had never since visited the Castle. On the Restoration, the remembered services of the Mortimer family, and the high fame of the youth's courage and ability, had procured him a distinguished situation in the navy. John Sandal's consequence now rose in the eyes of the family, of whom he was at first an inmate on toleration only; and even Mrs Ann Mortimer began to express some anxiety to hear tidings of her valiant cousin John. When she spoke thus, the light of Elinor's eye fell on her aunt with as rich a glow as ever summer sun on an evening landscape; but she felt, at the same moment, an oppression,–an indefinable suspension of thought, of speech, almost of breath, which was only relieved by the tears which, when retired from her aunt's presence, she indulged in. Soon this feeling was exchanged for one of deeper and more agitating interest. The war with the Dutch broke out, and Captain John Sandal's name, in spite of his youth, appeared conspicuous among those of the officers appointed to that memorable service.

'Mrs Ann, long accustomed to hear the names of her family uttered always in the same breath with the stirring report of high heroic deeds, felt the elation of spirit she had experienced in bygone days, combined with happier associations, and more prosperous auguries. Though far advanced in life, and much declined in strength, it was observed, that during the reports of the war, and while she listened to the accounts of her kinsman's valour and fast-advancing eminence, her step became firm and elastic, her lofty figure dilated to its youthful height, and a colour at times visited her cheek, with as rich and brilliant a tinge as when the first sighs of love murmured over its young roses. The high minded Margaret, partaking that enthusiasm which merged all personal feeling in the glory of her family and of her country, heard of the perils to which her cousin (whom she hardly remembered) was exposed, only with a haughty confidence that he would meet them as she felt she would have met them herself, had she been, like him, the last male descendant of the family of Mortimer. Elinor trembled and wept,–and when alone she prayed fervently.

'It was observable, however, that the respectful interest with which she had hitherto listened to the family legends so eloquently told by Mrs Ann, was now exchanged for a restless and unappeaseable anxiety for tales of the naval heroes who had dignified the family history. Happily she found a willing narrator in Mrs Ann, who had little need to search her memory, and no occasion to consult her invention, for splendid stories of those whose home was the deep, and whose battle-field was the wild waste ocean. Amid the gallery richly hung with family portraits, she pointed out the likeness of many a bold adventurer, whom the report of the riches and felicities of the new discovered world had tempted on speculations sometimes wild and disastrous, sometimes prosperous beyond the golden dreams of cupidity. 'How precarious!–how perilous!' murmured Elinor, shuddering. But when Mrs Ann told the tale of her uncle, the literary speculator, the polished scholar, the brave and gentle of the family, who had accompanied Sir Walter Raleigh on his calamitous expedition, and years after died of grief for his calamitous death, Elinor, with a start of horror, caught her aunt's arm, emphatically extended towards the portrait, and implored her to desist. The decorum of the family was so great, that this liberty could not be taken without an apology for indisposition;–it was duly though faintly made, and Elinor retired to her apartment.

'From February 1665,–from the first intelligence of De Ruyter's enterprises, till the animating period when the Duke of York was appointed to the command of the Royal fleet,–all was eager and anticipative excitement, and eloquent expatiations on ancient achievements, and presageful hopes of new honours, on the part of the heiress of Mortimer and Mrs Ann, and profound and speechless emotion on that of Elinor.

'The hour arrived, and an express was dispatched from London to Mortimer Castle with intelligence, in which King Charles, with that splendid courtesy which half redeemed his vices, announced himself most deeply interested, inasmuch as it added to the honours of the loyal family, whose services he appreciated so highly. The victory was complete,–and Captain John Sandal, in the phrase which the King's attachment to French manners and language was beginning to render popular, had 'covered himself with glory.' Amid the thickest of the fight, in an open boat, he had carried a message from Lord Sandwich to the Duke of York, under a shower of balls, and when older officers had stoutly declined the perilous errand; and when, on his return, Opdam the Dutch Admiral's ship blew up, amid the crater of the explosion John Sandal plunged into the sea, to save the half-drowning, half-burning wretches who clung to the fragments that scorched them, or sunk in the boiling waves; and then,–dismissed on another fearful errand, flung himself between the Duke of York and the ball that struck at one blow the Earl of Falmouth, Lord Muskerry, and Mr Boyle, and when they all fell at the same moment, wiped, with unfaultering hand, and on bended knee, their brains and gore, with which the Duke of York was covered from head to foot. When this was read by Mrs Ann Mortimer, with many pauses, caused by sight dim with age, and diffused with tears,–and when at length, finishing the long and laborious read detail, Mrs Ann exclaimed–'He is a hero!' Elinor tremblingly whispered to herself–'He is a Christian.'

'The details of such an event forming a kind of era in a family so sequestered, imaginative, and heroic, as that of the Mortimers, the contents of the letter signed by the King's own hand were read over and over again. They formed the theme of converse at their meals, and the subject of their study and comment when alone. Margaret dwelt much on the gallantry of the action, and half-imagined she saw the tremendous explosion of Opdam's ship. Elinor repeated to herself, 'And he plunged amid the burning wave to save the lives of the men he had conquered!' And some months elapsed before the brilliant vision of glory, and of grateful royalty, faded from their imagination; and when it did, like that of Micyllus, it left honey on the eye-lids of the dreamer.

'From the date of the arrival of this intelligence, a change had taken place in the habits and manners of Elinor, so striking as to become the object of notice to all but herself. Her health, her rest, and her imagination, became the prey of indefinable fantasies. The cherished images of the past,–the lovely visions of her golden childhood,–seemed fearfully and insanely contrasted in her imagination with the ideas of slaughter and blood,–of decks strewed with corses,–and of a young and terrible conqueror bestriding them amid showers of ball and clouds of fire. Her very senses reeled between these opposite impressions. Her reason could not brook the sudden transition from the smiling and Cupid-like companion of her childhood, to the hero of the embattled deep, and of nations and navies on fire,–garments rolled in blood,–the thunder of the battle and the shouting.

'She sat and tried, as well as her wandering fancy would allow her, to reconcile the images of that remembered eye, whose beam rested on her like the dark blue of a summer heaven swimming in dewy light,–with the flash that darted from the burning eye of the conqueror, whose light was as fatal where it fell as his sword. She saw him, as he had once sat beside her, smiling like the first morning in spring,–and smiled in return. The slender form, the soft and springy movements, the kiss of childhood that felt like velvet, and scented like balm,–was suddenly exchanged in her dream (for all her thoughts were dreams) for a fearful figure of one drenched in blood, and spattered with brains and gore. And Elinor, half-screaming, exclaimed, 'Is this he whom I loved?' Thus her mind, vacillating between contrasts so strongly opposed, began to feel its moorings give way. She drifted from rock to rock, and on every rock she struck a wreck.

'Elinor relinquished her usual meetings with the family–she sat in her own apartment all the day, and most of the evening. It was a lonely turret projecting so far from the walls of the Castle, that there were windows, or rather casements, on three sides. There Elinor sat to catch the blast, let it blow as it would, and imagined she heard in its meanings the cries of drowning seamen. No music that her lute, or that which Margaret touched with a more powerful and brilliant finger, could wean her from this melancholy indulgence.

'Hush!' she would say to the females who attended her–'Hush! let me listen to the blast!–It waves many a banner spread for victory,–it sighs over many a head that has been laid low!'

'Her amazement that a being could be at once so gentle and so ferocious–her dread that the habits of his life must have converted the angel of her wilderness into a brave but brutal seaman, estranged from the feelings that had rendered the beautiful boy so indulgent to her errors,–so propitiatory between her and her proud relatives,–so aidant in all her amusements,–so necessary to her very existence.–The tones of this dreamy life harmonized, awfully for Elinor, with the sound of the blast as it shook the turrets of the Castle, or swept the woods that groaned and bowed beneath its awful visitings. And this secluded life, intense feeling, and profound and heart-rooted secret of her silent passion, held perhaps fearful and indescribable alliance with that aberration of mind, that prostration at once of the heart and the intellect, that have been found to bring forth, according as the agents were impelled, 'the savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.' She had all the intensity of passion, combined with all the devotedness of religion; but she knew not which way to steer, or what gale to follow. She trembled and shrunk from her doubtful pilotage, and the rudder was left to the mercy of the winds and waves. Slender mercy do those experience who commit themselves to the tempests of the mental world–better if they had sunk at once amid the strife of the dark waters in their wild and wintry rage; there they would soon have arrived at the haven where they would be secure.

'Such was the state of Elinor, when the arrival of one who had been long a stranger in the vicinity of the Castle caused a strong sensation in its inhabitants.

'The widow Sandal, the mother of the young seaman, who had hitherto lived in obscurity on the interest of the small fortune bequeathed her by Sir Roger, (under the rigid injunction of never visiting the Castle), suddenly arrived in Shrewsbury, which was scarce a mile from it, and declared her intention of fixing her residence there.

'The affection of her son had showered on her, with the profusion of a sailor, and the fondness of a child, all the rewards of his services–but their glory;–and in comparative affluence, and honoured and pointed to as the mother of the young hero who stood high in royal favour, the widow of many sorrows took up her abode once more near the seat of her ancestors.

'At this period, every step taken by the member of a family was a subject of anxious and solemn consultation to those who considered themselves its heads, and there was a kind of chapter held in Mortimer Castle on this singular movement of the widow Sandal. Elinor's heart beat hard during the debate–it subsided, however, at the determination, that the severe sentence of Sir Roger was not to be extended beyond his death, and that a descendant of the house of Mortimer should never live neglected while almost under the shadow of its walls.

'The visit was accordingly solemnly paid, and gratefully received,–there was much stately courtesy on the part of Mrs Ann towards her niece, (whom she called cousin after the old English fashion), and a due degree of retrospective humility and decorous dejection on that of the widow. They parted mutually softened towards, if not pleased with each other, and the intercourse thus opened was unremittingly sustained by Elinor, whose weekly visits of ceremony soon became the daily visits of interest and of habit. The object of the thoughts of both was the theme of the tongue of but one; and, as is not uncommon, she who said nothing felt the most. The details of his exploits, the description of his person, the fond enumeration of the promises of his childhood, and the graces and goodliness of his youth, were dangerous topics for the listener, to whom the bare mention of his name caused an intoxication of the heart, from which it scarce recovered for hours.

'The frequency of these visits was not observed to be diminished by a faint rumour, which the widow seemed to believe, rather from hope than probability, that Captain Sandal was about to visit the neighbourhood of the Castle. It was one evening in autumn, that Elinor, who had been prevented during the day from visiting her aunt, set out attended only by her maid and her usher. There was a private path through the park, that opened by a small door on the verge of the suburbs where the widow lived. Elinor, on her arrival, found her aunt from home, and was informed she had gone to pass the evening with a friend in Shrewsbury. Elinor hesitated for a moment, and then recollecting that this friend was a grave staid widow of one of Oliver's knights, wealthy, however, and well respected, and a common acquaintance, she resolved to follow her thither. As she entered the room, which was spacious, but dimly lit by an old-fashioned casement window, she was surprised to see it filled with an unusual number of persons, some of whom were seated, but the greater number were collected in the ample recess of the window, and among them Elinor saw a figure, remarkable rather for its height, than its attitude or pretension,–it was that of a tall slender boy, about eighteen, with a beautiful infant in his arms, whom he was caressing with a tenderness that seemed rather associated with the retrospective fondness of brotherhood, than the anticipated hope of paternity. The mother of the infant, proud of the notice bestowed on her child, made, however, the usual incredulous apology for its troubling him.

'Troubling me!' said the boy, in tones that made Elinor think it was the first time she had heard music. 'Oh, no–if you knew how fond I am of children,–how long it is since I had the delight of pressing one to my breast–how long it may be again before'–and averting his head, he bowed it over the babe. The room was very dark, from the increasing shades of evening, deepened by the effect of the heavy wainscotting of its walls; but at this moment, the last bright light of an autumnal evening, in all its rich and fading glory, burst on the casement, powering on every object a golden and purpureal light. That end of the apartment in which Elinor sat remained in the deepest shade. She then distinctly beheld the figure which her heart seemed to recognize before her senses. His luxuriant hair, of the richest brown, (its feathery summits tinged by the light resembling the halo round some glorified head), hung, according to the fashion of the day, in clusters on his bosom, and half-concealed the face of the infant, as it lay like a nestling among them.

'His dress was that of a naval officer,–it was splendidly adorned with lace, and the superb insignia of a foreign order, the guerdon of some daring deed; and as the infant played with these, and then looked upward, as if to repose its dazzled sight on the smile of its young protector, Elinor thought she had never beheld association and contrast so touchingly united,–it was like a finely coloured painting, where the tints are so mellowed and mingled into each other, that the eye feels no transition in passing from one brilliant hue to another, with such exquisite imperceptibility are they graduated,–it was like a fine piece of music, where the art of the modulator prevents your knowing that you pass from one key to another; so softly are the intermediate tones of harmony touched, that the ear knows not where it wanders, but wherever it wanders, feels its path is pleasant. The young loveliness of the infant, almost assimilated to the beauty of the youthful caresser, and yet contrasted with the high and heroic air of his figure, and the adornments of his dress, (splendid as they were), all emblematic of deeds of peril and of death, seemed to the imagination of Elinor like the cherub-angel of peace reposing on the breast of valour, and whispering that his toils were done. She was awoke from her vision by the voice of the widow.–'Niece, this is your cousin John Sandal.' Elinor started, and received the salute of her kinsman, thus abruptly introduced, with an emotion, which, if it deprived her of those courtly graces which ought to have embellished her reception of the distinguished stranger, gave her, at least, the more touching ones of diffidence.

'The forms of the day admitted of, and even sanctioned, a mode of salutation since exploded; and as Elinor felt the pressure of a lip as vermeil as her own, she trembled to think that that lip had often given the war-word to beings athirst for human blood, and that the arm that enfolded her so tenderly had pointed the weapons of death with resistless and terrible aim against bosoms that beat with all the cords of human affection. She loved her young kinsman, but she trembled in the arms of the hero.

'John Sandal sat down by her, and in a few moments the melody of his tones, the gentle facility of his manner, the eyes that smiled when the lips were closed, and the lips whose smile was more eloquent in silence than the language of the brightest eyes, made her gradually feel at ease with herself–she attempted to converse, but paused to listen–she tried to look up, but felt like the worshippers of the sun, sickening under the blaze she gazed on,–and averted her eyes that she might see. There was a mild, inoppressive, but most seductive light in the dark-blue eyes that fell so softly on hers, like moon-light floating over a fine landscape. And there was a young and eloquent tenderness in the tones of that voice, which she expected to have spoken in thunder, that disarmed and dulcified speech almost to luxury. Elinor sat, and imbibed poison at every inlet of the senses, ear, and eye, and touch, for her kinsman, with a venial, and to her imperceptible licence, had taken her hand as he spoke. And he spoke much, but not of war and blood, of the scenes where he had been so eminent, and of the events to which his simple allusion would have given interest and dignity,–but of his return to his family, of the delight he felt at again beholding his mother, and of the hopes that he indulged of being not an unwelcome visitor at the Castle. He inquired after Margaret with affectionate earnestness, and after Mrs Ann with reverential regard; and in mentioning the names of these relatives, he spoke like one whose heart was at home before his steps, and whose heart could make every spot where it rested a home to itself and to others. Elinor could have listened for ever. The names of the relatives she loved and revered sounded in her ears like music, but the advancing night warned her of the necessity of returning to the Castle, where the hours were scrupulously observed; and when John Sandal offered to attend her home, she had no longer a motive to delay her departure.

'It had appeared dark in the room where they were sitting, but it was still rich and purple twilight in the sky, when they set out for the Castle.

'Elinor took the path through the park, and, absorbed in new feelings, was for the first time insensible of its woodland beauty, at once gloomy and resplendent, mellowed by the tints of autumnal colouring, and glorious with the light of an autumnal evening,–till she was roused to attention by the exclamations of her companion, who appeared rapt into delight at what he beheld. This sensibility of nature, this fresh and unworn feeling, in one whom she had believed hardened by scenes of toil and terror against the perception of beauty,–whom her imagination had painted to her as fitter to cross the Alps, than to luxuriate in Campania,–touched her deeply. She attempted to reply, but was unable,–she remembered how her quick susceptibility of nature had enabled her to sympathize with and improve on the admiration expressed by others, and she wondered at her silence, for she knew not its cause.

'As they approached the Castle, the scene became glorious beyond the imagination of a painter, whose eye has dreamed of sun-set in foreign climes. The vast edifice lay buried in shade,–all its varied and strongly charactered features of tower and pinnacle, bartizan and battlement, were melted into one dense and sombrous mass. The distant hills, with their conical summits, were still clearly defined in the dark-blue heaven, and their peaks still retained a hue of purple so brilliant and lovely, that it seemed as if the light had loved to linger there, and, parting, had left that tint as the promise of a glorious morning. The woods that surrounded the Castle stood as dark, and apparently as solid as itself. Sometimes a gleam like gold trembled over the tufted foliage of their summits, and at length, through a glade which opened among the dark and massive boles of the ancient trees, one last rich and gorgeous flood of light burst in, turned every blade of grass it touched into emerald for a moment,–paused on its lovely work–and parted. The effect was so instantaneous, brilliant, and evanishing, that Elinor had scarce time for a half uttered exclamation, as she extended her arm in the direction where the light had fallen so brightly and so briefly. She raised her eyes to her companion, in that full consciousness of perfect sympathy that makes words seem like counters, compared to the sterling gold of a heart-minted look. Her companion had turned towards it too. He neither uttered exclamation, nor pointed with finger,–he smiled, and his countenance was as that of an angel. It seemed to reflect and answer the last bright farewell of day, as if friends had parted smiling at each other. It was not alone the lips that smiled,–the eyes, the cheeks, every feature had its share in that effulgent light that was diffused over his aspect, and all combined to make that harmony to the eye, which is often as deliciously perceptible, as the combination of the most exquisite voices with the most perfect modulation, is to the ear. To the last hour of her mortal existence, that smile, and the scene where it was uttered, were engraved on the heart of Elinor. It announced at once a spirit, that, like the ancient statue, answered every ray of light that fell on it with a voice of melody, and blended the triumph of the glories of nature with the profound and tender felicities of the heart. They spoke no more during the remainder of their walk, but there was more eloquence in their silence than in many words.

* * * *

'It was almost night before they arrived at the Castle. Mrs Ann received her distinguished kinsman with stately cordiality, and affection mingled with pride. Margaret welcomed him rather as the hero than the relative; and John, after the ceremonies of introduction, turned to repose himself on the smile of Elinor. They had arrived just at the time when the chaplain was about to read the evening prayers,–a form so strictly adhered to at the Castle, that not even the arrival of a stranger was permitted to interfere with its observance. Elinor watched this moment with peculiar solicitude;–her religious feelings were profound, and amid all the young hero's vivid display of the gentlest affections, and purest sensibilities by which our wretched existence can be enhanced or beautified, she still dreaded that religion, the companion of deep thought and solemn habits, might wander far for an abode before it settled in the heart of a sailor. The last doubt passed from her mind, as she beheld the intense but silent devotion with which John mingled in the family rite. There is something very ennobling in the sight of male piety. To see that lofty form, that never bowed to man, bowed to the earth to God,–to behold the knee, whose joints would be as adamant under the influence of mortal force or threat, as flexible as those of infancy in the presence of the Almighty,–to see the locked and lifted hands, to hear the fervent aspiration, to feel the sound of the mortal weapon as it drags on the floor beside the kneeling warrior,–these are things that touch the senses and the heart at once, and suggest the awful and affecting image of all physical energy prostrate before the power of the Divinity. Elinor watched him even to the forgetfulness of her own devotions;–and when his white hands, that seemed never formed to grasp a weapon of destruction, were clasped in devotion, and one of them slightly and occasionally raised to part the redundant curls that shaded his face as he knelt, she thought that she beheld at once angelic strength and angelic purity.

'When the service concluded, Mrs Ann, after repeating her solemn welcome to her nephew, could not help expressing her satisfaction at the devotion he had showed; but she mingled with that expression a kind of incredulity, that men accustomed to toil and peril could ever have devotional feelings. John Sandal bowed to the congratulatory part of Mrs Ann's speech, and, resting one hand on his short sword, and with the other removing the thick ringlets of his luxuriant hair, he stood before them a hero in deed, and a boy in form. A blush overspread his young features, as he said, in accents at once emphatic and tremulous, 'Dear Aunt, why should you accuse those of neglecting the protection of the Almighty who need it most. They who 'go down to the sea in ships, and occupy their business in the great waters,' have the best right to feel, in their hour of peril, 'it is but the wind and the storm fulfilling his word.' A seaman without a belief and hope in God, is worse off than a seaman without chart or pilot.'

'As he spoke with that trembling eloquence that makes conviction be felt almost before it is heard, Mrs Ann held out to him her withered but still snow-white hand to kiss. Margaret presented hers also, like a heroine to a feudal knight; and Elinor turned aside, and wept in delicious agony.

* * * *

'When we set ourselves resolutely to discover perfection in a character, we are always sure to find it. But Elinor needed little aid from the pencil of imagination to colour the object that had been stamped by an ineffaceable touch upon her heart. Her kinsman's character and temper developed themselves slowly, or rather were developed by external and accidental causes; for a diffidence almost feminine prevented his ever saying much,–and when he did, himself was the last theme he touched on. He unfolded himself like a blowing flower,–the soft and silken leaves expanded imperceptibly to the eye, and every day the tints were deepening, and the scent becoming richer, till Elinor was dazzled by their lustre, and inebriated with the fragrance.

'This wish to discover excellencies in the object we love, and to identify esteem and passion by seeking the union of moral beauty and physical grace, is a proof that love is of a very ennobling character,–that, however the stream may be troubled by many things, the source at least is pure,–and that the heart capable of feeling it intensely, proves it possesses an energy that may one day be rewarded by a brighter object, and a holier flame, than earth ever afforded, or nature ever could kindle.

* * * *

'Since her son's arrival, the widow Sandal had betrayed a marked degree of anxiety, and a kind of restless precaution against some invisible evil. She was now frequently at the Castle. She could not be blind to the increasing attachment of John and Elinor,–and her only thought was how to prevent the possibility of their union, by which the interest of the former and her own importance would be materially affected.

'She had obtained, by indirect means, a knowledge of the contents of Sir Roger's will; and the whole force of a mind which possessed more of art than of power, and of a temper which had more passion than energy, was strained to realize the hopes it suggested. Sir Roger's will was singular. Alienated as he was from his daughter Sandal, and his younger son the father of Elinor, by the connexions they had adopted, it seemed to be the strongest object of his wishes to unite their descendants, and invest the wealth and rank of the house of Mortimer in the last of its representatives. He had therefore bequeathed his immense estates to his grand-daughter Margaret, in the event of her marrying her kinsman John Sandal;–in the case of his marrying Elinor, he was entitled to no more than her fortune of £5000;–and the bequest of the greater part of the property to a distant relative who bore the name of Mortimer, was to be the consequence of the non-intermarriage of Sandal with either of his cousins.

'Mrs Ann Mortimer, anticipating the effect that this opposition of interest to affection might produce in the family, had kept the contents of the will a secret,–but Mrs Sandal had discovered it by means of the domestics at the Castle, and her mind wrought intensely on the discovery. She was a woman too long familiar with want and privation to dread any evil but their continuance, and too ambitious of the remembered distinctions of her early life, not to risk any thing that might enable her to recover them. She felt a personal feminine jealousy of the high-minded Mrs Ann, and the noble-hearted beautiful Margaret, which was unappeasable; and she hovered round the walls of the Castle like a departed spirit groaning for its re-admission to the place from which it had been driven, and feeling and giving no peace till its restoration was accomplished.

'When with these feelings was united the anxiety of maternal ambition for her son, who might be raised to a noble inheritance, or sunk to comparative mediocrity by his choice, the result may be easily guessed; and the widow Sandal, once determined on the end, felt little scruple about the means. Want and envy had given her an unslakeable appetite for the restored splendours of her former state; and false religion had taught her every shade and penumbra of hypocrisy, every meanness of artifice, every obliquity of insinuation. In her varied life she had known the good, and chosen the evil. The widow Sandal was now determined to interpose an insurmountable obstruction to their union.

* * * *

'Mrs Ann still flattered herself that the secret of Sir Roger's will was suppressed. She saw the intense and disruptable feeling that seemed to mark John and Elinor for each other; and, with a feeling half-borrowed from magnanimity, half from romance, (for Mrs Ann had been fond of the high-toned romances of her day), she looked forward to the felicity of their union as being little disturbed by the loss of land and lordship,–of the immense revenues,–and the far-descended titles of the Mortimer family.

'Highly as she prized these distinctions, dear to every noble mind, she prized still more highly the union of devoted hearts and congenial spirits, who, trampling on the golden apples that were flung in their path, pressed forward with unremitting ardour for the prize of felicity.

'The wedding-day of John and Elinor was fixed,–the bridal clothes were made,–the noble and numerous friends summoned,–the Castle hall decorated, the bells of the parish church ringing out a loud and merry peal, and the blue-coated serving men adorned with favours, and employed in garnishing the wassail bowl, which was doomed by many a thirsty eye to be often drained and often replenished. Mrs Ann herself took with her own hands, from an ample chest of ebony, a robe of velvet and satin, which she had worn at the court of James the First, on the marriage of the princess Elizabeth with the prince palatine, of whom the former, to borrow the language of a contemporary writer, had 'brided and bridled it so well, and indeed became herself so handsomely,' that Mrs Ann, as she arrayed herself, thought she saw the splendid vision of the royal bridal float before her faded eyes in dim but gorgeous pageantry once more. The heiress, too, attired herself splendidly, but it was observed, that her beautiful cheek was paler than even that of the bride, and the smile which held a fixed unjoyous station on her features all that morning, seemed more like the effort of resolution than the expression of felicity. The widow Sandal had betrayed considerable agitation, and quitted the Castle at an early hour. The bridegroom had not yet appeared, and the company, after having in vain for some time awaited his arrival, set out for the church, where they supposed he was impatiently expecting them.

'The cavalcade was magnificent and numerous–the dignity and consequence of the Mortimer family had assembled all who had aspired to the distinction of their acquaintance, and such was then the feudal grandeur attendant on the nuptials of a high-descended family, that relatives, however remote in blood or in local distance, collected for sixty miles in every direction around the Castle, and presented a 'host of friends, gorgeously arrayed and attended on that eventful morning.'

'Most of the company, even including the females, were mounted on horseback, and this, by apparently increasing the number of the procession, added to its tumultuous magnificence. There were some cumbrous vehicles, misnamed carriages, of a fashion indescribably inconvenient, but gorgeously gilded and painted,–and the Cupids on the pannels had been re-touched for the occasion. The bride was lifted on her palfrey by two peers,–Margaret rode beside her gallantly attended,–and Mrs Ann, who once more saw nobles contending for her withered hand, and adjusting her silken rein, felt the long-faded glories of her family revive, and led the van of the pompous procession with as much dignity of demeanour, and as much glow of faded beauty, once eminent and resistless, as if she still followed the gorgeous nuptial progress of the princess palatine. They arrived at the church,–the bride, the relatives, the splendid company, the minister–all but the bridegroom, were there. There was a long painful silence. Several gentlemen of the bridal party rode rapidly out in every direction in which it was thought probable to meet him,–the clergyman stood at the altar, till, weary of standing, he retired. The crowd from the neighbouring villages, combined with the numerous attendants, filled the church-yard. Their acclamations were incessant,–the heat and distraction became intolerable, and Elinor begged for a few moments to be allowed to retire to the vestry.

'There was a casement window which opened on the road, and Mrs Ann supported the bride as she tottered towards it, attempting to loose her wimple, and veil of costly lace. As Elinor approached the casement, the thundering hoofs of a horse at full speed shook the road. Elinor looked up mechanically,–the rider was John Sandal,–he cast a look of horror at the pale bride, and plunging his desperate spurs deeper, disappeared in a moment.

* * * *

'A year after this event, two figures were seen to walk, or rather wander, almost every evening, in the neighbourhood of a small hamlet in a remote part of Yorkshire. The vicinage was picturesque and attractive, but these figures seemed to move amid the scenery like beings, who, if they still retained eyes for nature, had lost all heart for it. That wan and attenuated form, so young, yet so withered, whose dark eyes emit a fearful light amid features chill and white as those of a statue, and the young graces of whose form seem to have been nipt like those of a lily that bloomed too soon in spring, and was destroyed by the frost of the treacherous season, whose whispers had first invited it to bud,–that is Elinor Mortimer,–and that figure that walks beside her, so stiff and rectangular, that it seems as its motion was regulated by mechanism, whose sharp eyes are directed so straight forward, that they see neither tree on the right hand, or glade on the left, or heaven above, or earth beneath, or any thing but a dim vision of mystic theology for ever before them, which is aptly reflected in their cold contemplative light, that is the Puritan maiden sister of her mother, with whom Elinor had fixed her residence. Her dress is arranged with as much precision as if a mathematician had calculated the angles of every fold,–every pin's point knows its place, and does its duty–the plaits of her round-eared cap do not permit one hair to appear on her narrow forehead, and her large hood, adjusted after the fashion in which it was worn by the godly sisters, who rode out to meet Prynne on his return from the pillory, lends a deeper shade to her rigid features,–a wretched-looking lacquey is carrying a huge clasped bible after her, in the mode in which she remembered to have seen Lady Lambert and Lady Desborough march to prayer, attended by their pages, while she proudly followed in their train, distinguished as the sister of that godly man and powerful preacher of the word, Sandal. From the day of her disappointed nuptials, Elinor, with that insulted feeling of maiden pride, which not even the anguish of her broken heart could suppress, had felt an unappeaseable anxiety to quit the scene of her disgrace and her misfortune. It was vainly opposed by her aunt and Margaret, who, horror-struck at the event of those disastrous nuptials, and wholly unconscious of the cause, had implored her, with all the energy of affection, to fix her residence at the Castle, within whose walls they pledged themselves he who had abandoned her should never be permitted to place his foot. Elinor answered the impassioned importunities, only by eager and clinging pressures of her cold hands, and by tears which trembled on her eyelids, without the power to fall.–'Nay, stay with us,' said the kind and noble-hearted Margaret, 'you shall not leave us!' And she pressed the hands of her kinswoman, with that cordial touch that gives a welcome as much to the heart as to the home of the inviter.–'Dearest cousin,' said Elinor, answering, for the first time, this affectionate appeal with a faint and ghastly smile–'I have so many enemies within these walls, that I can no longer encounter them with safety to my life.'–'Enemies!' repeated Margaret.–'Yes, dearest cousin–there is not a spot where he trod–not a prospect on which he has gazed–not an echo which has repeated the sound of his voice,–that does not send daggers through my heart, which those who wish me to live would not willingly see infixed any longer.' To the emphatic agony with which these words were uttered, Margaret had nothing to reply but with tears; and Elinor set out on her journey to the relative of her mother, a rigid Puritan, who resided in Yorkshire.

'As the carriage was ordered for her departure, Mrs Ann, supported by her female attendants, stood on the draw-bridge to take leave of her niece, with solemn and affectionate courtesy. Margaret wept bitterly, and aloud, as she stood at a casement, and waved her hand to Elinor. Her aunt never shed a tear, till out of the presence of the domestics,–but when all was over,–'she entered into her chamber, and wept there.'

'When her carriage had driven some miles from the Castle, a servant on a fleet horse followed it at full speed with Elinor's lute, which had been forgotten,–it was offered to her, and after viewing it for some moments with a look in which memory struggled with grief, she ordered its strings to be broken on the spot, and proceeded on her journey.

'The retreat to which Elinor had retired, did not afford her the tranquillity she expected. Thus, change of place always deceives us with the tantalizing hope of relief, as we toss on the feverish bed of life.

'She went in a faint expectation of the revival of her religious feelings–she went to wed, amid the solitude and desert where she had first known him, the immortal bridegroom, who would never desert her as the mortal one had done,–but she did not find him there–the voice of God was no longer heard in the garden–either her religious sensibility had abated, or those from whom she first received the impression, had no longer power to renew it, or perhaps the heart which has exhausted itself on a mortal object, does not find its powers soon recruited to meet the image of celestial beneficence, and exchange at once the visible for the invisible,–the felt and present, for the future and the unknown.

'Elinor returned to the residence of her mother's family in the hope of renewing former images, but she found only the words that had conveyed those ideas, and she looked around in vain for the impressions they had once suggested. When we thus come to feel that all has been illusion, even on the most solemn subjects,–that the future world seems to be deserting us along with the present, and that our own hearts, with all their treachery, have done us no more wrong than the false impressions which we have received from our religious instructors, we are like the deity in the painting of the great Italian artist, extending one hand to the sun, and the other to the moon, but touching neither. Elinor had imagined or hoped, that the language of her aunt would have revived her habitual associations–she was disappointed. It is true no pains were spared–when Elinor wished to read, she was furnished amply with the Westminster Confession, or Prynne's Histriomastrix; or if she wished for lighter pages, for the Belles Lettres of Puritanism, there were John Bunyan's Holy War, or the life of Mr Badman. If she closed the book in despair at the insensibility of her untouched heart, she was invited to a godly conference, where the non-conformist ministers, who had been, in the language of the day, extinguished under the Bartholomew bushel,1 met to give the precious word in season to the scattered fold of the Lord. Elinor knelt and wept too at these meetings; but, while her form was prostrated before the Deity, her tears fell for one whom she dared not name. When, in incontroulable agony, she sought, like Joseph, where she might weep unobserved and unrestrained, and rushed into the narrow garden that skirted the cottage of her aunt, and wept there, she was followed by the quiet, sedate figure, moving at the rate of an inch in a minute, who offered her for her consolation, the newly published and difficultly obtained work of Marshall on Sanctification.



1 Anachronism–n'importe.



'Elinor, accustomed too much to that fatal excitement of the heart, which renders all other excitement as faint and feeble as the air of heaven to one who has been inhaling the potent inebriation of the strongest perfumes, wondered how this being, so abstracted, cold, and unearthly, could tolerate her motionless existence. She rose at a fixed hour,–at a fixed hour she prayed,–at a fixed hour received the godly friends who visited her, and whose existence was as monotonous and apathetic as her own,–at a fixed hour she dined,–and at a fixed hour she prayed again, and then retired,–yet she prayed without unction, and fed without appetite, and retired to rest without the least inclination to sleep. Her life was mere mechanism, but the machine was so well wound up, that it appeared to have some quiet consciousness and sullen satisfaction in its movements.

'Elinor struggled in vain for the renewal of this life of cold mediocrity,–she thirsted for it as one who, in the deserts of Afric, expiring for want of water, would wish for the moment to be an inmate of Lapland, to drink of their eternal snows,–yet at that moment wonders how its inhabitants can live among SNOW. She saw a being far inferior to herself in mental power,–of feelings that hardly deserved the name–tranquil, and wondered that she herself was wretched.–Alas! she did not know, that the heartless and unimaginative are those alone who entitle themselves to the comforts of life, and who can alone enjoy them. A cold and sluggish mediocrity in their occupations or their amusements, is all they require–pleasure has with them no meaning but the exemption from actual suffering, nor do they annex any idea to pain but the immediate infliction of corporeal suffering, or of external calamity–the source of pain or pleasure is never found in their hearts–while those who have profound feelings scarce ever look elsewhere for either. So much the worse for them,–the being reduced to providing for the necessities of human life, and being satisfied when that provision is made, is perhaps the best condition of human life–beyond that, all is the dream of insanity, or the agony of disappointment. Far better the dull and dusky winter's day, whose gloom, if it never abates, never increases,–(and to which we lift up an eye of listlessness, in which there is no apprehension of future and added terrors),–to the glorious fierceness of the summer's day, whose sun sets amid purple and gold,–while, panting under its parting beams, we see the clouds collecting in the darkening East, and view the armies of heaven on their march, whose thunders are to break our rest, and whose lightnings may crumble us to ashes.

* * * *

'Elinor strove hard with her fate,–the strength of her intellect had been much developed since her residence at Mortimer Castle, and there also the energies of her heart had been developed fatally. How dreadful is the conflict of superior intellect and a burning heart, with the perfect mediocrity of the characters and circumstances they are generally doomed to live with! The battering-rams play against wool-bags,–the lightnings glance on ice, hiss, and are extinguished. The greater strength we exhibit, we feel we are more and more paralyzed by the weakness of our enemies,–our very energy becomes our bitterest enemy, as it fights in vain against the impregnable fortress of total vacuity! It is in vain we assail a foe who neither knows our language or uses our weapons. Elinor gave it up,–yet still she struggled with her own feelings; and perhaps the conflict which she now undertook was the hardest of all. She had received her first religious impressions under the roof of her Puritanic aunt, and, true or false, they had been so vivid, that she was anxious to revive them. When the heart is robbed of its first-born, there is nothing it will not try to adopt. Elinor remembered a very affecting scene that had occurred in her childhood, beneath the roof where she now resided.

'An old non-conformist minister, a very Saint John for sanctity of life, and simplicity of manners, had been seized by a magistrate while giving the word of consolation to a few of his flock who had met at the cottage of her aunt.

'The old man had supplicated for a moment's delay on the part of the civil power, and its officers, by an unusual effort of toleration or of humanity, complied. Turning to his congregation, who, amid the tumult of the arrest, had never risen from their knees, and only changed the voice of supplication from praying with their pastor, to praying for him,–he quoted to them that beautiful passage from the prophet Malachi, which appears to give such delightful encouragement to the spiritual intercourse of Christians,–'Then they that feared the Lord, spoke often to one another, and the Lord heard it,' &c. As he spoke, the old man was dragged away by some rougher hands, and died soon after in confinement.

'On the young imagination of Elinor, this scene was indelibly written. Amid the magnificence of Mortimer Castle, it had never been effaced or obscured, and now she tried to make herself in love with the sounds and the scene that had so deeply touched her infant heart.

'Resolute in her purposes, she spared no pains to excite this reminiscence of religion,–it was her last resource. Like the wife of Phineas, she struggled to bear an heir of the soul, even while she named him Ichabod,–and felt the glory was departed. She went to the narrow apartment,–she seated herself in the very chair that venerable man occupied when he was torn from it, and his departure appeared to her like that of an ascending prophet. She would then have caught the folds of his mantle, and mounted with him, even though his flight had led to prison and to death. She tried, by repeating his last words, to produce the same effect they had once had on her heart, and wept in indescribable agony at feeling those words had no meaning now for her. When life and passion have thus rejected us, the backward steps we are compelled to tread towards the path we have wandered from, are ten thousand times more torturing and arduous than those we have exhausted in their pursuit. Hope then supported our hands every step we took. Remorse and disappointment scourge us back, and every step is tinged with tears or with blood; and well it is for the pilgrim if that blood is drained from his heart, for then–his pilgrimage will be sooner terminated.

* * * *

'At times Elinor, who had forgotten neither the language or habits of her former existence, would speak in a manner that gave her Puritanic relative hopes that, according to the language of the times, 'the root of the matter was in her,'–and when the old lady, in confidence of her returning orthodoxy, discussed long and learnedly on the election and perseverance of the saints, the listener would startle her by a burst of feeling, that seemed to her aunt more like the ravings of a demoniac, than the language of a human being,–especially one who had from her youth known the Scriptures. She would say, 'Dearest aunt, I am not insensible of what you say; from a child, (thanks to your care), I have known the holy scriptures. I have felt the power of religion. At a latter period I have experienced all the enjoyments of an intellectual existence. Surrounded by splendour, I have conversed with enlarged minds,–I have seen all that life can shew me,–I have lived with the mean and the rich,–the spiritual in their poverty, and the worldly-minded in their grandeur,–I have deeply drank of the cup which both modes of existence held to my lip,–and at this moment I swear to you,–one moment of heart,–one dream such as once I dreamed, (and thought I should never awake from), is worth all the existence that the earthly-minded lavish on this world, and those who mystify expend on the next!'–'Unfortunate wretch! and undone for everlasting!' cried the terrified Calvinist, lifting up her hands.–'Cease, cease,' said Elinor with that dignity which grief alone can give,–'If I have indeed devoted to an earthly love that which is due to God alone, is not my punishment certain in a future state? Has it not already commenced here? May not then all reproaches be spared when we are suffering more than human enmity can wish us,–when our very existence is a bitterer reproach to us than malignity can utter?'–As she spoke, she added, wiping a cold tear from her wasted cheek, 'My stroke is heavier than my groaning!'

'At other times she appeared to listen to the language of the Puritan preachers (for all were preachers who frequented the house) with some appearance of attention, and then, rushing from them without any conviction but that of despair, exclaimed in her haste, 'All men are liars!' Thus it fares with those who wish to make an instant transition from one world to another,–it is impossible,–the cold wave interposes–for ever interposes, between the wilderness and the land of promise–and we may as soon expect to tread the threshold which parts life and death without pain, as to cross the interval which separates two modes of existence so distinct as those of passion and religion, without struggles of the soul inexpressible–without groanings which cannot be uttered.

'To these struggles there was soon to be an addition. Letters at this period circulated very slowly, and were written only on important occasions. Within a very short period, Elinor received two letters by express from Mortimer Castle, written by her cousin Margaret. The first announced the arrival of John Sandal at the Castle,–the second, the death of Mrs Ann,–the postscriptums of both contained certain mysterious hints relative to the interruption of the marriage,–intimations that the cause was known only to the writer, to Sandal and to his mother,–and entreaties that Elinor would return to the Castle, and partake of the sisterly love with which Margaret and John Sandal would be glad to receive her. The letters dropt from her hand as she received them,–of John Sandal she had never ceased to think, but she had never ceased to wish not to think,–and his name even now gave her a pang which she could neither utter or suppress, and which burst forth in an involuntary shriek, that seemed like the last string that breaks in the exquisite and too-highly strung instrument of the human heart.

'Over the account of Mrs Ann's death, she lingered with that fearful feeling that a young adventurer experiences, who sees a noble vessel set out before him on a voyage of discovery, and wishes, while lingering in harbour himself, that he was already at the shore where it has arrived, and tasted of its repose, and participated in its treasures.

'Mrs Ann's death had not been unworthy of that life of magnanimity and high heroic feeling which had marked every hour of her mortal existence–she had espoused the cause of the rejected Elinor, and sworn in the chapel of Mortimer Castle, while Margaret knelt beside, never to admit within its walls the deserter of his betrothed bride.

'On a dim autumnal evening, when Mrs Ann, with fading sight but undiminished feeling, was poring over some of Lady Russel's letters in manuscript, and, to relieve her eyes, sometimes glanced on the manuscript of Nelson's Fasts and Festivals of the Church of England,–it was announced to her that a Cavalier (the servants well knew the charm of that name to the ear of the ancient loyalist) had crossed the draw-bridge, entered the hall, and was advancing to the apartment where she sat. 'Let him be admitted,' was her answer, and rising from her chair, which was so lofty and so spacious, that as she lifted herself from it to greet the stranger with a courtly reception, her form appeared like a spectre rising from an ancient monument,–she stood facing the entrance–at that entrance appeared John Sandal. She bent forwards for a moment, but her eyes, bright and piercing, still recognized him in a moment.

'Back!–back!'–exclaimed the stately ancestress, waving him off with her withered hand–'Back!–profane not this floor with another step!'–'Hear me, madam, for one moment–suffer me to address you, even on my knees–I pay the homage to your rank and relationship–misunderstand it not as an acknowledgement of guilt on my part!'

'Mrs Ann's features at this action underwent a slight contraction–a short spasmodic affection. 'Rise, Sir–rise,' she said–'and say what you have to say–but utter it, Sir, at the door whose threshold you are unworthy to tread.'

'John Sandal rose from his knees, and pointed instinctively as he rose to the portrait of Sir Roger Mortimer, to whom he bore a striking resemblance. Mrs Ann acknowledged the appeal–she advanced a few steps on the oaken floor–she stood erect for a moment, and then, pointing with a dignity of action which no pencil could embody to the portrait, seemed to consider her attitude as a valid and eloquent answer–it said–he to whose resemblance you point, and claim protection from, never like you dishonoured these walls by an act of baseness–of heartless treachery! Betrayer!–look to his portrait! Her expression had in it something of the sublime–the next moment a strong spasm contracted her features–she attempted to speak, but her lips no longer obeyed her–she seemed to speak, but was not heard even by herself. She stood for a moment before John Sandal in that rigid immoveable attitude that says, 'Advance not another step at your peril–insult not the portraits of your ancestors–insult not their living representative, by another step of intrusion!' As she spoke thus, (for her attitude spoke), a stronger spasm contracted her features. She attempted to move–the same rigid constriction extended to her limbs; and, waving her prohibitory arm still, as it in defiance at once of the approach of death and of her rejected kinsman, she dropt at his feet.

* * * *

'She did not long survive the interview, nor did she ever recover the use of speech. Her powerful intellect was, however, unimpaired; and to the last she expressed herself most intelligibly by action, as determined not to hear a word explanatory of Sandal's conduct. This explanation was therefore made to Margaret, who, though much shocked and agitated at the first disclosure, seemed afterwards perfectly reconciled to it.

'Shortly after the receipt of these letters, Elinor took a sudden, but perhaps not singular resolution,–she determined to set out immediately for Mortimer Castle. It was not her weariness of the withering life, the  she lived at her Puritanic aunt's–it was not the wish to enjoy again the stately and splendid ceremonial of Mortimer Castle, contrasted with the frugal fare and monastic rigour of the cottage in Yorkshire–it was not even the wish for that change of place that always flatters us with change of circumstance, as if we did not carry our own hearts with u
