Welcome to my first blog! Allow me to introduce myself a bit and give you a little information about my background. In the mid-90s, I had just entered MTSU to study English with a minor in secondary education. In one of my first classes, we were required to give little speeches about an educational topic. I chose censorship. Someone else in my class chose ADD/ADHD. I wasn't really listening to her speech. At the time, I thought ADD/ADHD was just some disorder that allowed bad parents to medicate their children into submission. Then the student handed out a list of "ADHD traits." As I started reading them, I was surprised at how many of them fit me. In fact, it was as if someone had handed me a list describing ME! I immediately ran to the bookstore and picked up a copy of Driven to Distraction. At the time, it was one of the few books on Adult ADD/ADHD, even if it was located in the children's reference section. The more I read, the more I was convinced that I might have ADHD and I decided to get a diagnosis. I went to a specialist in Nashville, TN, and got my suspicions confirmed. Since that time, I have spent a good portion educating myself and others about ADHD. After graduating with my Bachelor's Degree, I taught high school English for a year before going back and getting my Master's Degree in Special Education. Most of my research was done on ADD/ADHD. I knew that I was on my way to becoming an expert when one of my special education teachers contacted me to help another student dealing with ADHD. As a special education teacher, I have always found it helpful to share my own insights with my students and parents about being ADHD. I understand it on a different level than most other teachers because I experience it on a day-to-day basis. I also strongly feel that ADHD is a gift. Like any gift, it comes with advantages and disadvantages. ADHD is a part of me and I refuse to accept that any part of me is "bad." Sure, I am not perfect and there are things I could improve, but that doesn't mean I'm planning to change who I am. I have also worked as an ADHD coach and as an advocate for others with ADHD.
