I am not the typical RPG gamer. I have never been a fan of the games where you pick your actions from a menu. This is a real-time RPG. It is wide open from the begining, although one might want to watch where they venture. High-level nasties, and locked doors may block your way. If you are a mage, dispatching the baddies will come easier. If you are a theif, you can take care of those pesky locks with ease. But, your class is not limited.
