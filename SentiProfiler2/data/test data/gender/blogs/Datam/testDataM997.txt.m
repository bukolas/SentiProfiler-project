Now that's how to play up and at 'em without breaking players legs. If Pulis watched the Chelsea-Inter game tonight he should have taken notes.

Inter were all over Chelsea from the off. They wanted the game so much more than Chelsea and the hard work paid off. Chelsea played as if they expected to be gifted a dramatic late winner and Drogba got all stroppy when it didn't happen. Fantastic.

Yes Inter's tactics at defending corners were far from savoury but they got away with it and it made me laugh to see John Terry kicking off for no apparent reason other than that his team had lost at the final whistle. Haha-de-ha.

That aside I was bored throughout. The first leg was dull enough and there were 3 goals mixed in there. Tonight Inter's defence were solid once again and Mourinho admitted to celebrating wildly with his players in the dressing room. Fair enough. Ancelotti said before the game that he'd have a glass of wine with Mourinho post-match. Quite whether that will happen remains to be seen but I can't imagine Ancelotti will want to talk football if they do. After Eto'o scored Inter's winner (a goal that won me over Â£60- cheers Samuel!) the camera cut to Ancelotti and you could almost see the lemon juice trickling down his chin.
