Now, something you may or may not know about me is I love to dance. I mean I reallllly love to dance. Not nasty body grinding dancing, but just moving to the beat of the music. Or in my case, more often the beat in my own head. Turn on a dance song and I transform into what looks like a crazed jumping bean. Some of my friends on the retreat had never seen this before. There was a lot of "Where do you get that energy?," "I've never seen you so excited!," and ".....whaaaa....?!?!"

I think my biggest fan is Lindsay. She cannot believe my dancing, or the faces I make while doing it. She's seen me go crazy enough that now, she almost immediately runs to where ever I am in the room when a song comes on, and we act like idiots together. Our energy and excitement is infectious, and eventually, most everyone around stops worrying about how they look, give in, and join. There's the jumping, the swimming move, the running in place, and of course, the fist pump. All with a huge smile and bright eyes.

Do I look silly? Definitely. Do I care? Not at all. Do I sincerely love every single second? Absolutely.

The point is this-I truly believe that dance parties are one of life's ways of saying "Hey, I love you man." You can forget all your problems and stress, let down all your inhibitions, and tap into the unafraid free spirit that is in all of us.

So the next time you hear a good song, don't think about who is watching or what they'll say.
