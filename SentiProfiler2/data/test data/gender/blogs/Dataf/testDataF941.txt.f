Anywayyyyyy. Last Sunday I spent most of the day over at Amanda's house. I brought her a birthday gift, that she was so surprised to get! I had been sneaky and ordered a limited edition Belle and Chip ornament that she wanted but wouldn't buy for herself. And we re-arranged the spare bedroom in the house. It kinda became a "catch all" type room and that's not cool. We were going to do that a couple months ago and never got around to it. After that we went to Koch Arena and saw Maroon 5. That was the other part of her birthday gift. We were approx 4th row. About 10 feet away from Adam Levine. Good times!

Thanksgiving was okay. My sister was sick. My aunt/uncle and cousins came over and ugh, my aunt really drives me bonkers anymore. She brought 30 pounds of turkey (and a bunch of other food) for 9 people. Can we do the math on that? Whatever. My cousin Tori, who is only 7 years old, wasn't feeling too great while she was here. At some point she got feeling worse and ended up throwing up. She was miserable, but my freaking aunt/uncle didn't feel the need to leave. She threw up at least twice more before they thought to take her home.

After they left...I noticed the time and hurried outside in time to see the ISS and Space Shuttle Atlantis flying over. It was right on schedule as the news had reported it would be. Definitely one of the coolest things I've seen in a while. It only looked like 2 very bright lights moving across the sky but still very cool to watch.

I played phone tag with David all week. He called me on Monday to invite me to dinner that he had planned with Virleena. I've never been a fan of that girl, so I held out for my own dinner plans with him. We met up at Cheddar's on Friday night even though I felt like total crap. I'm convinced that I was exposed to the flu on Thursday. David's wife was very nice, though the language barrier was difficult. She's Japanese, and speaks way less English than I expected. David seems quite content with her, which is good. Stephanie was there too. I love that girl like a sister. She's had a rough time this year, 22 years old and divorced. I'm going to make a bigger/better effort to keep in touch with her now that I have her number again. Hanging out with the Lewis siblings is exactly what I needed. A dose of 2 of my favorite people on the planet. No matter the time apart and distance between us, it's like nothing ever changed. There are things I would've liked to talk with David about, but it just didn't happen. Oh well. Unfortunately, I won't get to see him again during this visit. He and Natsumi are headed back to Japan tomorrow morning. It always bums me out to know that I won't get to see him again for months on end - but life goes on. Something funny though, David is one of my best friends, but I learned something about him that I never knew! Not an interest - just an off the wall amusing fact.
