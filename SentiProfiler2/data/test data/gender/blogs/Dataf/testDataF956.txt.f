Did you imagine them? Good.

I remember the day I was heading back from Columbus and stopped at wendy’s to purchase some chicken nuggets for the drive.  A "new menu item" caught my eye and I decided to live dangerously and try it out. 

These nuggets were delicious!  

I continued home to toledo and went to wendy's the next day in order to procure some more of the delightful nuggets but soon found out that they were only a limited offer in a limited area.  

If only I had known I could have bought more of them just outside of Columbus.  I’m sure they would have traveled well being 98% preservatives and 2% outstanding deliciousity. 

That was the last time i would have the opportunity to shove those reddish chunks of deep fried heaven into my face.

Here is my proposal.  We all need to post "bring back wendy's spicy chicken nuggets" in our status updates.  

Enough of us together can make a difference!

We need to use this great opportunity to take back the power they're trying to steal from us!

I’d like to point out now that by kudoing you are agreeing to the terms and conditions contained within this blog.  if i find out later that you used your status update to promote your own market agenda legal action may (or may not) be taken!

I’m not saying everyone "has" to do this but i'll probably think less of you if you don't.
