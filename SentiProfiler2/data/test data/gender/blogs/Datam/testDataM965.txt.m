Anyway no, I'm not considering a career in acting or any of the above. I was pondering princess for a while, but I worry that the idea might cast aspersions on my sexuality if nothing else, along with all the responsibility etc. Too much hassle.

No, I've found myself actually enjoying a piece of coursework me and a coursemate of mine have been working on for the last term. It's a Flash application; a website designed for promoting a game, which is in our case, fictional. I've gotten really into it, so much so that all my other projects have been on the backburner while I focus on this one. A dangerous thing to happen, but I really can't help it. I've spent the last 2-3 weeks designing menus, buttons, banners, flashy images, messing around with animation, really keen to get our site looking great and exciting to toy with. Everything makes a fun little sound when clicked, explosions fly on-screen to background music, I love it. And it's becoming more second-nature how do do things with Flash too the further we progress.
