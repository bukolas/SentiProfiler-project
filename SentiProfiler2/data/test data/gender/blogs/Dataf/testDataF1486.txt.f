I'm not exactly sure what to feel at this point. As a little girl you grow up believing your father is like superman and nothing can hurt him except for kryptonite. As you get older of course, that belief fades and you realize that he is human just like everyone else. But a part of you still wants to hold on to it. Watching my father in that hospital bed made me truly understand how fragile life truly is..........I'm going to miss my daddy.........I hope he found a happier place to be.
