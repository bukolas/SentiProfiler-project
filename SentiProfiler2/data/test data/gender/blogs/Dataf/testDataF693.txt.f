I took 3 kids to Disneyworld and then on the Disney Cruise - talk about needing a vacation. The people on the ship were fantastic. The kids all had different clubs to go to, they had a fantastic time, always something for them to do. I missed dinner due to just needing a nap one night, I received a call from my service crew, wanting to know if everything was alright, offering me a later dinner time or to send me room service. When leaving, 2 of my kids left behind items.
