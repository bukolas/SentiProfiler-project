A quondam is probably a very difficult mathematical question which you ponder over for hours and still never find the answer, only to discover much later that you missed the point entirely and the answer was staring you in the face. Something like that anyway. Hopefully your invented meanings will carry slightly more weight. Invent away please. A purfle can be a fancy border. So, to purfle is to make something fancy. That's my version of what the dictionary says and it's close enough to the truth, so that's good enough for me. My daughter will be doing a bit of purfling before the school disco tonight, methinks. Well done to the inventors of interesting meanings for purfle. I have placed my favourite three on the poll for the voters to decide. Orotund describes a particular way of speaking which could be described by some as pompous and pretentious. Others may simply say the speaker was particularly dignified in their oratory. Thanks a million for your fabulous invented meanings for orotund. Today's fabulous winner was Bonnie. Great work Bonnie. Hope to see you here again soon. If I have read my dictionary correctly, to nuncupate is to make a declaration of your last will and testament through the spoken word rather than the written word. Presumably that's like when Auntie Nellie tells little Rita that she'll leave her collection of salt and pepper shakers to her when she dies. I really enjoyed coming back from my holiday to find lots of great meanings on the blog for nuncupate. You've all worked very hard while I was scoring cricket games in the sun. Well done to all of you. And a special congrats to Realityjunkie for a winning meaning on the poll. For those who enjoy figuring out the root meaning behind words, menology is related to month. But not in a menstrual way exactly. It's related to month in a calendar way. In fact, a menology is a calendar of the Greek Church which contains biographies of saints. That beats my invented meaning hands down. Thanks for your meanings and the long wait between words. Excuses, excuses, she said. I have none. Pure laziness is my only offering. Well done to new player on the blog (or old player with new name)- Metamatician - for a great win on the poll today. Hope you return soon. A lazaret is a special hospital for the diseased poor. Your meanings for lazaret were well thought out and interesting. Realityjunkie beat the opposition with her meaning. Well done, RJ. I had never heard of the word kickshaw until I found it in the dictionary yesterday. It's meaning could be useful though. My dictionary explains kickshaw as usually a derogatory term for a fancy cooked meal. Too fancy presumably. It then goes on to add the terms toy and trifle. I kind of get it. Your invented meanings were much easier to understand, clever and very enjoyable. Thanks for playing. And well done to silver_flight for a winning meaning on the poll today. Jussive refers to expressing a command. Nothing like as interesting as our invented meanings. Congrats to new player Ruby Rosamund for a first up win on the poll today. Great work Ruby! Keep it up. Sorry I haven't been on the blog daily, by the way. I'm doing my best to update as often as possible, and will try to be more frequent in future.
