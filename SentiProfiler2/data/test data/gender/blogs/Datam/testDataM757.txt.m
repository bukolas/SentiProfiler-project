A work in progress.. for those interested. As sideline, I hardly ever used prelims in the past, but now I do, takes the heavy lifting out when doing large paintings... Npw with next day update... the two panel Nom painting moves along.. The Nom painting is nearly 6 feet tall, the other isnt small either.I have eye strain again, I use photography lights set up behind my back to illuminate the painting etc, but the brightness over my shoulder is fucking with my eyes... GAH !Still the paintings are moving along ! A prequel to a early WWR painting, im sure if you care, you can figure it out. A  fun quick painting ! To be seen in Fuck It im sure..Now with Tommy update !  blocking away... Sparrow 14 should be in stores soon I guess.
