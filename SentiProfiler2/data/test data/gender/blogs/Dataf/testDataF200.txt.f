About three things I was absolutely positive.
First, Stephenie Meyer was going to be in Tempe, AZ at an address I knew.
Second, there was a dress there that I wanted...and it wasn't going to be cheap.
And third, I was intently and tenaciously going to fight for it I woke up so excited to be in the vicinity of Stephenie Meyer that day. I call her OZ. Not because she is small behind a curtain but because she is the gatekeeper of the wonderful land of Twilight. She created it, she got it published, and she made more of it for us. Thank you Stephenie for being our greatest mentor. A strong, talented, mother and wife, who has crazy boy dreams just like us!

I set off that day determined to get the lunch. If you guys remember I blogged about lunch and ‘Forever Dawn’ being exactly what I was throwing my money at. Somehow it changed along the way.

The auction started and the dress somehow became the focus after the lunch went nuts. And when I say nuts...watch this video to see. Lunch to me was something that could not be duplicated. Well, she could have lunch everyday with someone but to pick her brain on anything Twilight you could think of would be priceless. Kudos to Carol for getting it!

I decided at one point that there could be more 'Forever Dawn' Epilogues printed out. Making the one item that could not be duplicated the Eclipse prom dress. There will never be another worn by Stephenie, for an event she created around her book coming out. To me this became the item I had to have.

Now me being competitive might have something to do with it. Two ladies came running up to the front of the room. This was two rows, directly in front of me. I looked at Jason (my husband) and gave him a smirk...maybe with a little bit of snark which he took as a let's get em' look. Everything that day had gone into the thousands of dollars.
Eclipse Manuscript $1300.00
Host Skateboard $1100.00
Lunches $6500.00 X 2
Forever Dawn epilogue $5100.00
I knew the dress was going to be insane with all the hype. I sat next to a reporter who kept asking me, "how much you think this will go for". It was fun as we predicted the numbers.

The two ladies were Laura from Twilight Lexicon and Kara from Twilight Moms. So here they are, two rows ahead, bickering back and forth on the figures $5,000 to $5,300. J.S. Lewis says, "you have a sparkle Twilight Mom shirt--you have money". I started dying laughing. It was funny! He was good at egging them on. Finally Jason says loudly, "$5,300" and the ladies start to scramble. They actually tried to pull their money together or help each other somehow. I thought okay here is big dog twilight site and another big dog twilight site ganging up on me, the little Twilight site. I looked at Jason and said, "Get it". Jason yelled out "$5,500". Kara and Laura were a little stunned and I think they knew we didn't look like we were giving up anytime soon and conceded.

I could hardly contain my excitement! I ran up to them and said, "Twifans.com will take good care of the dress ladies" and almost sprinted to meet Stephenie Meyer for the first time that day.
