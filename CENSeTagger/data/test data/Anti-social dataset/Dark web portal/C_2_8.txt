I have lost respect for Hamas when this story broke out. This organizaion have not been same ever since the Sheikh Ahamed Yassin became martyred. Money, greed, politics became priority over the religion of peace. It's funny how Hamas will not the recognize the existence of Israel but will negotiate with Israel for maintaining lasting cease-fire with them. Hyprcracy has no place in our religion. May Allah(Swt) guide all of us and unite the muslims ummah.
