30 Rock is a very...unique...show.  It's very easy to see why the Emmys flock to it like tweens to a Taylor Lautner poster; there's simply nothing else like it on TV.  A show like The Office usually goes out for more obvious discomfort-related gags, while 30 Rock engages a much more rapid-fire hit and miss of total absurdity.  It's been a few weeks since we've seen lachrymose Liz Lemon, even after the Olympics, and I can honestly say I missed the witty offbeat charm 30 Rock does so well.
