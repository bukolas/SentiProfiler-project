I was born in 1946 and lived outside of Mitchell, South Dakota by the James River I did a lot of hunting, fishing and trapping. There was a rock dam on the river where at one time stood a flour mill. I would spear carp and sell them to a nearby mink farm where they where used as mink food. I went to Riverside grade school, a one-roomed country school house â€¦.then I went to Mitchell Senior High.
