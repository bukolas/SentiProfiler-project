I went to the Valvoline in Aurora. It was such an amazing experience. The manager, Jim, was very helpful and knowledgable. After going to Jiffy Lube I was scared of feeling pressured to buy more services but that wasn't the case AT ALL. He explained to me what was recommended for my car but didn't pressure me to do it at all. The prices were decent. The wait time was reasonable. I think I might come back to this store every time now.... even though I live all the way in Brookfield. I have never felt more at ease with a service station before.
