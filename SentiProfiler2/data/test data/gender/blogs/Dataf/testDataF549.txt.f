I like to think of this theater as the Colosseum's older, neglected brother. Standing on the edge of the Jewish Ghetto, the Teatro Marcello is in great shape. It doesn't have regular opening hours, but they usually hold concerts there in the summer. I've never been, but maybe I'll finally get around to it this year. It was a beautiful day out and I took a bit of a walk in Pigneto to get to know it a bit better and take some photos. I snapped this both because of the way the light was hitting the symmetrical architecture, but also because of the two old men gossiping out of the window on the bottom right. This architecture is a bit of an anomaly in the neighborhood, as most of the buildings are much lower to the ground. A Friday evening in March and this is the scene outside of Sora Margherita, one of the well-known restaurants located in the Jewish Ghetto . I had reservations with friends for 9:30 pm and we still had to wait 20 minutes to get inside the tiny restaurant. Being artichoke season I, of course, started out with the classic carciofo alla giudia . The leaves were crispy and delicious, the inside soft and tender. That was followed by fettucini con sugo alla coda, that was good, but not mind blowing. We definitely had fun and the food was good, but I found the place pricier than it merited, something that happens often to restaurants that are written up in guidebooks and magazines all the time. They try to make these places sound "hidden" and "undiscovered," but as anyone who lives here knows, most often the best places are the ones the press has never heard about, because if you're a local and you really love it, you probably keep it to yourself instead of blabbing to a journalist, for fear that it will be ruined. Last night I headed out to Studio Orizzonte, very close to Piazza Barberini, to an event sponsored by the art and culture magazine Fefe' Project (who is responsible for some of their own street art ). In honor of their tenth issue, they have decided to start an initiative where every two months, two street artists will be asked to "battle" by pasting their works up opposite each other on the huge outside walls of the studio. Fittingly, Sten and Lex were called into battle their studiomate Lucamaleonte in the first exchange. I say fittingly because collectively they're some of the most talented and well-known street artists and Sten and Lex will be opening their first solo show here on Friday. So, who do you think "won" the battle. Too close to call, no? You can check out a new piece by Lucamaleonte next Friday, March 19, at the opening of my next show Street - Walls Experience . I've seen a preview and it's not to be missed! Check out the write up in English on Fefe' Project's website. Ah, The Boxer ....how I love it so! In fact, it's the main reason I came back to the museum . Do you have any idea how rare it is to find something of this size from the ancient world in bronze? 9 times out of 10 the bronze was melted down as some point for use in weapons or newer sculptures, so it's a real treasure to have in the collection. But more than that, I just love his weary expression, bruised and battered, ears cut up, just after a fight with his tape on his hands. Really, it's something that could be seen today, which gives some perspective on how close we really are to our ancient ancestors. And, I've got to confess that the whole time I was editing these photos and writing the blog, I had " The Boxer " by Simon and Garfunkel in my head. Love that song. Tomorrow is the Festa delle Donne , so national museums were free for women this weekend and I took advantage by going to the Museo Nazionale di Roma at Palazzo Massimo. It's a wonderful collection which is rarely frequented by tourists and I'll be doing two posts on my favorite pieces. I should say that the space was revamped a few years ago and is one of the best laid out collections I've seen in Rome. Each room is uncluttered of objects, there are good didactic panels, and the entire collection is accessible due to ramps and elevators (something that can't be taken for granted here). Today's photos show two ancient sculptures depicting "Crouching Aphrodite" and a "Sleeping Hermaphrodite." I love the depiction of the female form in painting and sculpture, the way the curves of the body are shown. And I will always celebrate anything that embraces belly fat rolls as beautiful! The first images are of the Crouching Aphrodite, originally located in Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. It's a Roman copy after a Greek Hellenistic original. The second set of images are of "The Reclining Hermaphrodite," a common theme in ancient Greece and Rome, yet again pointing out that they were probably much more comfortable with different types of sexuality than we are today. From the back she appears as just another beautiful woman, but walk around to the other side of the sculpture and a surprise awaits . Museo Nazionale Romano - Palazzo Massimo alle Terme Via di Villa Peretti, 1 00185 Open Tue-Sun 9 am - 7:45 pm (box office closes 1 hr before) Ticket â‚¬7 (valid for entry to all National Museums for a period of 3 days) View Larger Map A new month, a new show! I'm putting on this show with the collective Elsewhere Factory and am really honored by all the great artists who decided to participate. Different images of street art that I photographed around Rome will be paired with original pieces contributed by each of the artists. Check out the press release we prepared below and I hope to see you at the opening on March 19! A unique look at the landscape of urban art interventions in Rome: Friday, March 19 at 7 pm the collective exhibit STREET - Walls Experience will open at Laboratorio51. This wine gallery, located in the heart of San Lorenzo, will play host to the exhibit until March 26. The event is being curated by Elsewhere Factory and Jessica Stewart, who has selected ten of her best street art photographs taken during her continuous documentation of urban art in Rome over the past year. All of the artists shown in the photographs have been asked to display a piece associated with their selected image. Among those participating are French stencil artist C215 , whose works can be seen in New York, San Paolo, New Dehli, and Paris, along with JB ROCK , OMINO71 and MR. KLEVRA , LUCAMALEONTE , HOGRE , URKA , ZILDA , UNO , CURT (from The Stickheads ). During the opening there will be an aperitivo with artiginal beer, wine, and snacks provided by Laboratorio51 and a DJ set by the duo Les Courgettes. "A year ago, wandering through the city in search of material for my blog RomePhotoBlog, I was struck by the huge number of stickers, stencils, and posters that I saw everywhere. My first photographs of street art were taken in San Lorenzo while trying to tell the story of that neighborhood through pictures, and from that moment on I became fascinated with street art and wanted to know more. Now every time I walk down the street, I see something new. After a year documenting every piece of street art I see, I decided to selected ten photographs that I felt were representative of the scene in Rome. There mostly Italians in the bunch, but some from abroad who have left their mark; there are some stencils, some posters. In the end, everyone has left their mark with a huge variety of works that cover most of Rome, in the show you'll see pieces from Pigneto, Monti, Ostiense, Piazza Flaminia, Trastevere, and more. The idea to ask these artists to contribute an original piece to display next to my photograph is to give people the opportunity to see the differences and similarities between each artist's work on the street and in a gallery setting. The show is also my chance to thank all the artists who leave me, and the city, a gift that makes me smile, as walking down the street and spotting one of their pieces is like seeing an old friend."
