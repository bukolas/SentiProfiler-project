I paid 100 bucks for this shirt. However, I'm now able to wear this thing to formal functions, instead of a suit and a tie. Can you believe it? I can wear this to the symphony. I can wear this to weddings-I did today. I have to say that I have procrastinated in making what has become an obligatory purchase.
