How to Market a Litigation Support Practice
Marketing to attorneys was on the mind of a document imaging executive when he called recently to talk about appropriate business development campaigns. This small firm has a limited budget and a definite need to sell more services to lawyers. 

Here are some suggestions we offered on how to market a litigation practice:
Market to existing law firm clients. Current clients are almost always your best source of immediate new revenue. You already enjoy a trusting relationship with them, and they need you to stay in touch.
E-newsletters are an inexpensive, effective way to stay in touch with your current list. Constant Contact or other similar services work very nicely.
Attend local bar association meetings, with an emphasis on groups that focus on plaintiff or defense litigators.
Write articles about your litigation support topics for bar association newsletters.
Keep your referral network primed, for favorable word-of-mouth referrals.
Try Google AdWords for online advertising.
There are many other ways to market a litigation support practice also. Call to discuss your marketing needs.
