hmmm.. raju ju ju.. viji attesting in her close friend's testimonial... me and raj started transfering friendship in college.... really he is an all in all azhagu raju attracting not only girls but also guys.. everyone come behind him... such a nice, naughty and lovely characters he is having...
i dont want to attest him has cute.., smart.., chocolaty.., handsome.., awesome.., perfect square.., bindaas and all... instead i can say.... " just see my friend raju's photo" that will do more...
hmmm cool.., he is nice tablist.. not like zakir ussain.., but talented in his own way..
he is very very friendly than anyone else.., the stunning matter i found in him and i never seen such a lovely character in anyone else.. give you example now.., whenever he felt like missing contacts of friends he use to call and say 
" yenna da machi contact ye illa"..
see everyone say like this.. but not within four days.. he couldn't even tolerate four days.. that type of friend he is...
