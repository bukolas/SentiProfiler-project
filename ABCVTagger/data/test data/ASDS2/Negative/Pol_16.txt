Mr. William Hamilton asked the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish a table showing the minimum and maximum rates of pay for each rank in the Army, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force in April 1981.
Mr. Blaker: The military salaries for members of the Armed Forces effective from 1 April 1981 are set out in appendices 1 and 2 to the supplement to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body's Tenth Report 1981, Cmnd. 8241. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, in answer to a written question on 15 May&#x2014;[Vol. 4, c. 343]&#x2014;announced the Government's acceptance in full of the review body's recommendations and these are the rates that now apply.
