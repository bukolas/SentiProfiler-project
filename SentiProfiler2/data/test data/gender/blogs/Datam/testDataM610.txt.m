The introductory song 'Guzarish' by Javed Ali and 'guest vocalist’ Sonu Niigaam is soft and romantic. AR Rehman has achieved mastery over composing romantic number and this time also he has kept his promise and has been successful in composing an ear-soothing track. Tamil GHAJINI listeners can identify it is similar to “suttum vizhi”,which was the song of the year 2005. The second track of the flick ‘Kaise Mujhe’ by Benny Dayal as male singer and Shreya Ghoshal as female singer is exceptional. The pair renders a stunning duet. The instrumental version of Kaise Mujhe has soothing and balmy effect. The musical piece has right fusion of two instruments – guitar and flute. This song slowly grows with you after 5-6 hearings, it will touch your hearts. The third track 'Aye Bachchu' by Suzanne comes as a massive shock. It has English words inserted in Hindi sentences but sorry to say the album is not up to the mark and will not make to the chartbuster. This song is really disappointing as it has no thrill and one would never expect such a disaster from music maestro Rehman. This track has lower down the glory of the album.  I think the director has forced rahman to have such a album similar to “yes machi” song in tamil. Next let us see “BEKHA” An unusual song with erratic melody given to mood swings. This is the song where you can admire Aamir not for his eights packs but six different vibrant looks and styles. Rendered by Karthik, the song is catchy in appearance. Rehman has full faith in him and thus bestowed on him the responsibility of singing this soulful song and Karthik has done full justice to it
