A full 8 hr theory day and u're forced to attend.Ur absolutely frustrated.turn around frm ur bench to see what the other side is doing 'Lakshmi' will be there smiling with all the teeth that exist .She's one person who can manage to laugh(exactly the same way - all 32 teeth) no matter how bad the situation is. Come assignments,observations,record,practicals and exams She's be there to help you out.Thank god she's in the same class as me.She's the only person who can teach me two full units in less than two hours the night before the exam.I dont have to touch upon already well known things abt her like she being helpful kind jovial and all that.But you want to crap (absolutely mindless crap i mean) you can keep taking to her.With her around you never feel the lack of a topic to talk about.she'll keep coming up with more and more topics.And Yeah YENGAL THALAIVI .The only person in our dept to have WON an election!she's got a massively wide friends circle and with her around its a laugh RIOT.CHEERS!!
