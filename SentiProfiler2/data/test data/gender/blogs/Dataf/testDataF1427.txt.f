Cargo Plantlove eyeshadow ($20, Sephora) is proof that “green” beauty is not merely eco-chic. It’s eco-fabulous.Even if I didn’t know that this eyeshadow was organic, I really wouldn’t care. Plantlove eyeshadow is, for the most part, silky, deeply pigmented and highly blendable.My top pick out of the collection is Dove, a sexy and utterly wearable shade of neutral deep blue gray that performs beautifully as both an understated liner by day and a dramatic, lid-to-crease, smoked-out eyeshadow by night.
