So that wasn't so bad. Have had already 5 glasses (small) of beer and feeling supremely woozy. World was all fuzzy, glasses came off (so I don't break it) and face was hot as heck. Things were suddenly really, really niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.

I was talking a fair bit of crap too. Can't remember what I said but judging from the delighted faces of my colleagues, it must have been awesome blackmail material.

And so there I was, singing off-key, swaying to the music (I was swaying anyway from the alcohol) and having shit-loads of fun.

Then the Black Russian came. He took the rest of me to the toilet. In a good way. (Yeah, that sounds dirty NOW.)

But make no mistake. It was DAMN tasty too. (At this point, JA kidnapped my phone to update my Twitter in a most drunken manner, IT WASN'T ME.)
