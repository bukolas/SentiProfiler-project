I ran 7 miles on Saturday. It felt good! I was strong, had good form and it wasn't as dreadful as I thought it would have been. I attempted 3 miles yesterday but I could tell that my body needed some rest so I ran a mile and walked a mile. Today is a rest day and I can tell my body needs it. It feels good to relax some, perhaps I'll actually get some scrapbooking or cleaning done.

Work is OK, we're moving locations. I knew this was coming just not so fast. I'm helping with seating arrangements and everyone and their uncle has to put their 2 cents in. Just be happy you have a desk to sit at!!! Then there's Miss Nosey pants co-worker who needs to know everything....Um I don't need your help with this so step back.

Passports came on Saturday so that's exciting....Germany here we come. Now only if flight prices would come down I'd be a happy girl.

Guess that's all, not much to say for a Monday morning.
