Television soaps have become a thing of the past with reality shows taking India by storm. Reality shows work on a nationwide level because they are interesting, they seem real, and the audience plays a big part in ‘who gets selected to go to the next level’. Also, millions of people’s dreams have come true with the advent of reality shows- they get to be on television and perfectly ordinary people become celebrities in the course of an episode or a ‘season’. Some shows have new people participating in every episode, and also the audience can easily relate to the participants. These money spinners can be in the form of quizzes, family shows, challenges, dance shows, singing competitions, etc. and these have a mass appeal unlike the soaps which have particular target audiences. Reality shows, besides whether they are really ‘real’ or fabricated, are enjoyable and generate huge profits. But when the participants of these shows in question, are children, there are a whole lot of things to be considered.
