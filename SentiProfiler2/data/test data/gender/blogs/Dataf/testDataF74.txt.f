A calm.. sunday evening… me and grandma walk along the dusty roads and reach the destination two streets away..It was my first time to an astrologer’s! Boy! I was excited! I have never really believed in it and was eager to see what it was all about…  We reached the place and aunty led us to the room where my friend’s thatha who is the astrologer was sitting. The 92 year old smiling man led us in. He was all of five feet, occupying 1/5th of his huge bed. Wasting no time, he took the horoscope from me. He had told us not to tell him what we had come for. He said he would find out! Hmm! Loves challenges I suppose… ! He casually flipped to the page where the boxes were drawn. Then started the intense calculations… His frail tiny hands jumped from one box to another … his hands ran along the boxes the way we used to do when we used to play snakes and ladder… He then erupted into a smile… HE is the reason for you coming here he announced pointing to “Venus”.!!! LOL!
