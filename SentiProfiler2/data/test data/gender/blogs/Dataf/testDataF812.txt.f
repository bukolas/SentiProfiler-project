USAA automobile insurance was initially for military officers only (but open to all military members and fam now). My dad went to the Naval Academy and served during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He completed his term right before troops were "frozen" for Vietnam.Since my dad had USAA, all family members could also sign up. I was on my dad's policy when I was a kid, and I continued my service when I "grew up."
