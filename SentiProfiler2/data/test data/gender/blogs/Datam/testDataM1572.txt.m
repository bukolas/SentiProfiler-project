I have been toying over the idea of creating a separate blog for my technical wanderings for some time now. Earlier, I had posted some technical posts on my main blog - www.abhishekontheweb.com, but, now, those seem out of place in a blog, which deals with more general stuff, like events, photography, articles (and whatever random thought comes in my mind). As, in the last few years, I have been working on various technologies, especially Java based, I thought of writing about some of the technical ideas that I have been influenced by, technical issues I have been intrigued by, and the upcoming technologies that I am working on. And what better place than to have a new blog just for that.

I would like to put in as much details as possible in my post, else this blog would defeat its purpose.
