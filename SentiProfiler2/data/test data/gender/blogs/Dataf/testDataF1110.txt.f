So a few weeks(?) ago I got a message from some guy on OkCupid. He seemed smart, funny, cute and familiar. Like we’d met already. I couldn’t place him, though.

So I replied to his message and said, straight out, You seem familiar, is it possible that we’ve met?

A couple of days passed and I didn’t hear back from him, so I figured he placed me from somewhere (maybe we went out years ago, or something) and didn’t want to reply.  In the meantime, I was getting some unwanted attention from a bunch of guys (young, persistent ones who clearly had been hearing wild things about older women) and so I decided to shut down the OkCupid profile and focus on Match and Chemistry.

So then a week or so later I got a message from that same guy on Match.com, asking me where I went to/why I disappeared? I thought it was sweet the way he followed up with me on another site. But he didn’t mention my question about looking familiar.

You know where this is going, don’t you?  I think I’ve figured it out.  After a few messages back and forth, he said something in a message that jogged my memory.  I think he’s this guy.  I’m 95% sure (but not 100%).  It’s embarrassing that I don’t recognize him from his pictures or profile and that he doesn’t recognize me (my profile is almost identical, and while my pictures are new they really do look like me).  But I have to admit, my memory is completely useless lately (I take some medicine that messes it up, and so I write EVERYTHING down).  And I’ve always been bad at recognizing people/faces.

So now what? He’s been aggressively pursuing me, online, for weeks. Do I just stop replying?  Do I tell him that I think we already went out last summer and tell him the details and see if it was him?  Do I just let it ride and go out with him, again, telling him nothing about my suspicions just to see what happens?

Could this possibly be the universe telling me that that bad date was a fluke and me and this guy should meet again?

Today's girl has really evolved in the last couple of years. I honestly didn't recognize her when I was going through the thumbnails!

Yesterday's answer is behind the cut. Were you correct?
