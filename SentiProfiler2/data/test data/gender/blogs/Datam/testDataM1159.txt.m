When I was in Barcelona with SIME on May 21, I had the chance to meet a veteran, well acclaimed journalist, Jennifer L. Schenker who is one of the industry’s most respected commentators with over 30 years working for leading publications like TIME Magazine, the International Herald Tribune and Red Herring. Since less than a year she runs her own venture, Informillo.com. And she claimed that bloggers are not journalists. She felt journalism is more about reporting facts and connecting information together without any personal bias, and blogging involves more of the personal factor, and is most of the times personal opinion more than information per se. Some how I felt that bloggers are journalists too since news events are first broken out in the blogs (and micro blogs now) too, and generally digg which could be a decent indicator of things that are on the top of the web mesh for the day predominantly features blogs along with news sites. And when you dig deeper, the word journalist encompasses both a columnist and a reporter. So probably blogging is all about being a columnist, but what happens if you include video bloggers? They interview people and spread information / news too. The intersection between traditional and new media is a grey area, and at least the pundits of the English language would not be a great fan of the cross pollination of the terms and usage.
