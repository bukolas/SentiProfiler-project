Let me say from the start that I work for Sprint and get free cell phone service. If I didn't work for Sprint (which will be the case very soon), I might easily make a different choice for a cell phone. However, I wanted to get a new phone and didn't want something as bulky as a Blackberry or even the Palm Pre. Most of my cell phone use is for simply making and receiving calls, so I wanted something that was so easy to carry that it was almost like it wasn't there.
