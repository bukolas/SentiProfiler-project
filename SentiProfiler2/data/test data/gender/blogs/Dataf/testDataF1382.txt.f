We've been on 2 Disney Cruises and going on our 3rd next month.  They are just great.  There is always so much to do or you can do nothing.    I like the 'doing nothing' part.  I go and sit at Quiet Cove Pool-the adults only pool-with a drink with an umbrella in my hand and bask in the sun.  There is nothing better than that.   All the cast members are so great and helpful.  Room service is great too!!!!  It's just so nice to sit in your room or on your verandah and eat while watching the ocean sail away.  We always have a catagory 7 state room so we have a verandah.
