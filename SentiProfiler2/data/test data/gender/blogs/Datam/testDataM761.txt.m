At Creation Moments, Ian Taylor starts by asking a scientific question about embryogenesis: How do other cells know to hook up with each other to make our circulatory system, or form the heart? A very good question, and one which is central evo-devo . He then puts forward a hypothesis developed by William Dryer, that olfactory receptors are responsible for cell-cell guidance. An interesting hypothesis formed, in part, because you expresses these genes in nearly every cell of your body. Please Mr. Taylor, tell us more about olfactory genes: Mammals and humans have more than a thousand different olfactory genes. Yes, and more than half of yours are pseudogenes . They are, so far as we know, non-functional and a waste of chromosomal space. Awfully efficient that creator of yours. One or another of these crisscrosses each of your cell seven times. Whoa, that is one huge protein! Oh wait, it crisscrosses the cell membrane seven times . Minor error. Well, if you want to read more about olfactory receptors (and actually learn something) Larry Moran seems to like the subject . But the good thing is that here is a hypothesis that can be tested. So what have people found? Um, well, this hypothesis doesn't have much evidence to support it . From the journal article: A claim that ectopic OR expression may be in part governed by neutral changes is supported by several findings. First, the divergence in the expression patterns of human-mouse orthologous OR pairs in ectopic tissues is similar to that of randomly selected pairs. This observation generalizes a previously reported specific case for OR51E2, which was found to be over-expressed in human prostate [39,40], although minor expression could be detected also in brain. Its mouse ortholog was found predominantly in brain, and its rat ortholog in brain and liver [43]. Second, OR transcription was found here to be unbiased with respect to any particular OR subgroup in ectopic tissues (except for the human 7E subfamily members, see below), as indicated by the approximate fit to a Poisson distribution. We note, though, that other studies have reported up to 300-fold difference in the levels of ORs transcription in mouse olfactory epithelium [5,16]. Last, OR pseudogenes were found here to be expressed in ectopic tissues at similar levels to those of intact genes. In contrast, in olfactory epithelium, where chemosensory functionality is expected, OR pseudogenes were found to be significantly less expressed than intact genes [16]. In short, the expression of the olfactory receptors appears to be random when measured by tissue, by species, by receptor subgroup, and by pseudogene vs. functional gene. That last one is important; the genes that don't do anything are translated just as much as the the genes that do. Maybe more work will turn up something, but for now the expression appears to be just noise. Not a big problem; most hypothesis end up not working so I doubt that anyone is losing sleep over this. Except maybe Mr. Taylor (from the original link): If [this hypothesis is] so, this system of knitting our unborn bodies together is an elegant and precise product of a loving Creator. So, does that mean that you now believe we aren't the product of a loving creator? Maybe just the product of a spiteful creator? You let me know.

An oft heard comment on wingnut radio shows and the odd tobacconist shop is that cigarette taxes aren't about health, they are about money; politicians don't want people to stop smoking because the state would lose revenue. This is a bit hard to swallow since the strength of the connection between tobacco smoke inhalation and health is only slightly less than the strong nuclear force ; revenue from tobacco taxes have leveled off in the past decade; and the IRS allows medical deductions for smoking cessation programs and prescriptions . Sometimes, it just isn't about the money. Like say the neo-prohibitionists who run Pennsylvania's liquor laws : More than a dozen armed State Police officers conducted simultaneous raids last week on three popular Philadelphia bars known for their wide beer selections. The cops confiscated hundreds of bottles of expensive ales and lagers, now in State Police custody at an undisclosed location. The alleged offense: Although the bar owners had bought the beer legally from licensed Pennsylvania distributors and had paid all the necessary taxes, the police claimed that nobody had registered the precise names of the beers with the state Liquor Control Board - a process that requires the brewers or their importers to pay a $75 registration fee for each product they want to sell in Pennsylvania. Notice that this is not the fault of tavern owner; it is the fault of the brewer/importer for not properly registering the beer. But the tavern owners are the ones holding the bag. They were raided not because they didn't pay taxes on the beer, but because some of the beer wasn't officially approved. Even though some of it was: ...more than half the beer removed by the State Police was properly registered - but the cops couldn't find it on their lists because of "clerical errors" or "blatant ineptitude" between the police and the Liquor Control Board, with whom the officers were conferring by telephone. Pennsylvania has many archaic beer laws. Though some legislators are trying to change them , it is still easier for me to get a six-pack of Victory than someone who actually lives in Pennsylvania. And I will gladly pay the tax on it too. Image via Wikimedia Commons Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al. An article on CNN caught my attention yesterday, concerning the blog of Jennifer McGruther . At NourishedKitchen she implemented a 28-day challenge to her readers for February: eat nothing but real food. From the CNN article: On Day One of the challenge, blogger Jennifer McGruther gave this instruction: Purge your pantry of processed foods. This meant everything with refined oils, white flour, sugar, low- and skimmed-milk products, margarine, processed cheeses, refined salt and dried pastas had to go. I understand the white flour, the bleaching process isn't necessary at all. But skim milk? Cheese? How do you make unprocessed cheese? Or sugar? Unprocessed salt is simply impossible. My dried pasta at home includes two ingredients: whole wheat and water. Does air drying it make it processed? Then I read her odd definition of processed foods: Processed food is defined as any food that has undergone a change of character. For example, edamame would be unprocessed, and tofu would be processed. Ugh, this is just a raw food diet that allows you to eat non-raw foods as long as you do it yourself. In no way, shape, or form does that represent what I would consider to be the definition of real food.- It's because of extremists like this that some have a completely misconstrued notion of what a foodie is . CNN, don't give those of us who care about food a bad name. Image via Wellesley College - "So what is your definition?" Good question. My non-specific answer would be "food pretending to be something it is not". Real cheese is made with milk and enzymes. Fake cheese adds oils, flavor enhancers, and preservatives. That doesn't mean I don't eat fake foods; it just means that I don't fool myself into thinking that Froot Loops are a totally awesome health food because now it is made with a little bit of whole grain wheat.

Doesn't your religion have something to say about that? First, errors in fact concerning rings around planets: For example, we have learned that all five of the outer planets are surrounded by rings. Now, these transcripts are old, so it is understandable that he would be including Pluto as a planet (1). But, Pluto does not have rings . At best, there is the possibility that it may have rings based on computer models, but there are no data supporting that possibility. Sorry Ian, you are just plain wrong. The rings are only inches thick and comprised of dust and ice in neat bands; No, they are not inches thick. Saturn's rings are about 1 km thick in areas and the rings of Uranus exceed 100 m. That's not just off by a little; that is off by 3-4 orders of magnitude. That's like hopping on a Southwest flight from Orlando to Phoenix and getting dropped of at Disneyworld. Not to mention that some of those chunks of ice are several meters across by themselves, and you get the idea that Mr. Taylor doesn't know what the hell he is talking about. Go on: Every astronomer knows that the forces of the solar wind, of gravity, and the unavoidable laws of physics should have destroyed a planetary ring in less than a million years. The rings are stable because of the laws of physics; gravitational pull on objects within the Roche limit stops them from coalescing. That's why astronomers think the rings are very old, probably as old as the solar system . Now to the lying. Mr. Taylor has a comment about shepherding satellites: But now an exhaustive study of Voyager 2's data from Uranus has shown perfect rings without any "shepherding satellites." WTF? The two confirmed shepherding satellites of Uranus, Ophelia and Cordelia , were discovered by Voyager 2 . If only your attention to detail were as exhaustive. Not only that, Mr. Taylor's idea seems to come primarily from a letter to the editor in Science News (2), which cites the existence of the two shepherding moons . I think Ian needs a fire extinguisher for his pants. Image via Wikimedia Commons (1) Unless Mr. Taylor was prescient and excluded Pluto. But then he would be including Mars in the five outer planets, and Mars doesn't have rings either. (2) Sorry, that link just shows the table of contents, but a complete copy of the letter is below: A number of researchers have suggested that the rings of Uranus -- compared with the solar system, which has been around for some 4.6 billion years -- look relatively young, perhaps less than a billion years old. But scientists are traditionally suspicious of explanations whose validity depends on observations made exactly at some key moment. How likely is it that the Voyager 2 spacecraft just happened to be around to photograph the rings during the short span when they existed? An alternative theory from Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado at Boulder suggests the rings may not be young at all. Instead, he proposes, their chunks keep grinding against one another in a way that continually creates new particles. Without some such regenerative process to sustain them, Esposito notes, the Uranian rings as Voyager 2 saw them would be gone in a billion years or less. Indeed, many of the particles are so small that they would be dragged down to destruction in that time by the planet's extended hydrogen atmosphere. The motions and present locations of two small Uranian moons known as "shepherd" satellites -- believed to be keeping one of the rings as sharp-edged and narrow as it is -- suggest they have been doing so for only about that long. Additional shepherds have been proposed for many of the other nine known Uranian rings, though no one has yet identified any in existing photos. Besides the main rings, Voyager 2's data also showed 50 to 100 tenuous "dust bands" containing smaller particles than the rings. But Esposito says their different positions mean the bands cannot have come from the rings. In a paper submitted to NATURE, he instead proposes that the dust in the bands may have been generated by micrometeoroids colliding with "unseen moonlets," each about 200 meters across, in belts some tens of kilometers wide, as well as by collisions between the moonlets themselves. "Both the moonlet belt objects and the main rings of Uranus have been created by the breakup of larger objects," he says. Any dust or rings that existed billions of years ago would long since have been removed by atmospheric drag, he says, so some mechanism must be creating new dust. In the solar system's early history, according to Esposito, the material that later became the Uranian ring system may have consisted simply of perhaps 10 to 12 moons, each about 200 kilometers across. Since then, the ring system has been in a continuing state of gradual evolution. ~~~~~~~~ By J. Eberhart Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al.

It doesn't matter if you look at mammals, reptiles, or fish, we all have it. It seems to be a relay center in communication between the forebrain (in mammals) and a whole host of midbrain structures, including the substantia nigra and raphe nuclei. These are the dopaminergic and serotonergic centers of the brain. So, you can understand why some who study addiction , schizophrenia , and/or depression are turning their attention habenularly (and if you don't understand, follow those links). In fact at least one case study points to deep brain stimulation of the lateral habenula as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression . While all vertebrates have a habenula, they don't all look the same. In addition to showing profound lateralization, the habenula of fish do not seem to separate into medial and lateral nuclei, as they do in mammals. However, just because the gross anatomy is different doesn't mean that connectivity (and function) follows suit. Amo et al. (2010) hypothesized that, because it is such a conserved structure, habenula of the zebrafish would also show subdivisions based on connectivity . This is basically a retrograde/anterograde tracing study. Except instead of using peroxidase based stains they are using awesomely fluorescent compounds. By injecting in the serotonergic centers of the zebrafish, they found retrograde labeling clustered within the ventral habenula; in mammals, similar tracing studies would show labeling in the lateral habenula. It is already known that the zebrafish dorsal habenula (and mammalian medial habenula) sends projections to the interpeduncular nucleus. So it seems that the medial/lateral subdivision in mammals corresponds to a dorsal/ventral subdivision in zebrafish. They also did an anterograde tracer to confirm this connection. Plus, as further confirmation, in mammals the descending projections from the medial habenula form the core of the fasciculus retroflexus while the projections from the lateral habenula form the sheath. Do the projections from the dorsal and ventral habenula of the zebrafish follow such a pattern? I wouldn't be mentioning it if they didn't. The green is GFP expressed in the dorsal habenula neurons while the navy blue is neurobiotin taken up retrogradely by ventral habenular neurons. Neat stuff. So now we know that the habenula of mammals and fish are homologous. Why is this important? One, transgenic studies in mammals are kind of messy. Sure, there is lots of work being done on mice, but the availability of other transgenic mammals is limited. By contrast, zebrafish may offer an alternative means of studying the functionality of
habenular output through genetic manipulation (1). Two, by identifying genes specific to the two habenular subdivisions, the authors were able to look at the development of the habenula in zebrafish. Turns out that the fish really do have a medial and lateral subdivision, the lateral division just migrates to a ventral position during development (2). This makes for a nice picture too. Now, if the ventral habenula has glutamatergic projections that inhibit monoaminergic brain centers, that would really be something.

I know you have a lot to offer, but you must be a vertebrate to go on this ride. (2) I am showing my speciesism, aren't I? It could just as well be that the mammalian ventral habenula fails to migrate to its proper position. Inane ramblings about science, religion, parenting, et al.
