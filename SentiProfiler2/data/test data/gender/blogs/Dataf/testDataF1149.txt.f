I have not intentionally given up blogging. We are simply at a point where living our lives is taking up all of our energy. There is progress going on, and there is also a lot of poop, peanut butter, toothpaste, urine and other stuff to clean up. We are having lots of fun in general, but it's a very energetic type of fun! Lots of chasing boys across soccer fields, through Target, and so forth. I always wondered what would happen when they got too big for strollers and shopping carts and now I know. I like to think my cardio vascular health must be getting great. Hope to return to blogging before too long.
