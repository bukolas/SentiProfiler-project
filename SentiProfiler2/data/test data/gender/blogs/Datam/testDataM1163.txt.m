Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934 - Hello everybody.By seeing the title u must be thinking that I am a law student but to tell u I am not a student of law and i am not telling you about the fundamentals of INDIAN constitution.I just wanted to tell you that there was a violation of "Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934" which states that the aircraft organisation have to abide by the rules given by BCAS (Bureau Of Civil Aviation Security) and in its guidelines BCAS has stated that vip's/vvip's are exempted from security checks or frisking.

Well you must be thinking that am I a vip.ha ofcourse not.but our former president Mr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a vvip and he was frisked and even asked to remove his shoes at IGI antional airport in New Delhi by security personnels of Continental Airlines(An U.S. based airlines).It was the boss of the airlines who made it necessary to be checked.Although you must be thinking that everyday many laws are broken why this in particular?because Mr. kalam is a role model for many of us and especially the student community.He represents INDIAN scientist community and frisking him is a fall of national pride .

Well it was a law which was broken in INDIA and it is not made internationally.There are greater offences than this one when we go in past .When George Fernandes was in ministry in NDA regime then he had to go security check in America when he was on an official visit there where as it is clearly stated that any minister from any country is exempted from security checks then why was it performed .It is not only one instance .Pranab mukherjee was coming back from France to India then also he has to go through security checks which is again unforgivable.I am great supporter for equality but then equality must not only be on papers it must be implemented.Checking our role models and people representing a country in name of the security is not permissible and even when it has been stated clearly.

Coming back to India a FIR has been registered against the employees concerned but i guess it will not do because they were only the people following orders the issue has to be taken to all the aircraft organisations and clear directives must be given to them and it must be cleared that if there is exemption then it must be applied for all and if there is not then everybody must be checked even a minister from any other country(but atithi devo bhava) .Security checks must be upgraded but not only for publicising it some concrete steps are to be followed other than just checking vvip's.
