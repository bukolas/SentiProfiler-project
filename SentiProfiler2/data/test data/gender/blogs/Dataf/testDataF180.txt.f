Happy Spring Equinox everyone! It's a beautiful day here in NY -- the sun is shining brightly, there's a light breeze blowing through, and hibernating flowers are just starting to poke their way up from the softened earth. I feel like cartwheeling on the grass, lying on the ground with the face turned toward the sun, and dancing to my own music. Yep, spring fever has hit me!

Last night I was lucky enough to witness an amazing performance of Tao: The Martial Art of Drumming. The performance was brilliant, electric, mesmerizing, mind-blowing and I'm still riding high from the energetic burst that I got from the performance. If you're not familiar with Taiko drumming, check out this video of a Tao performance: Not only was the performance music to my ears (literally) but it was also a feast for sight and feeling. The synchronized movements of the drummers kept me mesmerized and the beat reverberating through the auditorium and my body kept me literally humming with energy. 

That's what spring feels like to me -- everything is alive, a feast for the senses.

Yet so often we hold back aliveness for fear of feeling good. Think about yoga practices gone stale -- a practitioner pushes him/herself until the practice no longer feels good but is a routine without engagement of the senses.
