It was a beautiful sunset landing in Las Vegas last night, and today was a crazy good first day at the show! The fashion peeps are some of the coolest on the planet. Boundless creativity and vision. I was loving every minute of it...despite my sore feet! I would love to know how many miles I walked. It was a whole lot, but worth every step! 
Out of respect for the designers, I didn't take any close ups of the new products, but I did manage to snap a few shots to give you a little of the atmosphere.
This company makes their socks with bamboo...yes you read that right...bamboo! And, you would not believe how soft and wonderful they are! So cool...so GREEN...so awesome!

There was SO MUCH more, but I was so focused on the next rad piece around each corner, I just couldn't stop to take more photos. But, I will leave you with a very cool video I took at the end of the day in STREET
Have a great day eveyone! I'm off to start day 2! :-)
