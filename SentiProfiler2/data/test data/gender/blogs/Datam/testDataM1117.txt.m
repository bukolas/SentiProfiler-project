There are some people in this world who are given the possibility to realize their dreams. Only problem is, that these opportunities are place on their lap, but they either don't have the knowhow, persistence or maybe just get bored with the situation at hand and then, they simply don't see it through. I knew such a man...

This man I once knew was pretty resourceful. Ever since he was young he had this dream to travel the world. So, he looked for a career that would offer him that ticket. He liked music, opera in particular. He sang alright, but he soon realizes it would never gain him international acclaim. Knowing that singing was not going to fulfill that dream of his, he found a way to gather what money he could and traveled to a distant land.

Truth of the matter was, that this man was driven. He had his goals in mind and he was determined one way or another to get where he wanted. What he had going for him was that he was hard working, but that card playing risk taker of life always shadowed him. Yes, he gambled alright. But, it was strictly on life. Other people saw these qualities in him and he rose quickly in the ranks of the corporate world. And as destiny would have it, it allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his dream of traveling. In his travels he met all types of characters of the world of finance and trade. All of which suited him fine. Since these characters were now fulfilling his sense of adventure.
