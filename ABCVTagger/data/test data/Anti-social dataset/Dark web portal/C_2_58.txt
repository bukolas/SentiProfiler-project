In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. "Those who turn back as apostates after Guidance was clearly shown to them, Satan has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes. This, because they said to those who hate what Allah has revealed, "We will obey you in part of (this) matter"; but Allah knows their secrets. But how (will it be) when the angels take their souls at death, and smite their faces and their backs? This because they followed that which called forth the Wrath of Allah, and they hated Allah's good pleasure; so He made their (good) deeds of no effect. " (47:25-28) Death to the Traitors (1) In the current era, the Islamic Nation is being plagued by Arab leaders who serve as agents and spies for the West, and who have followed in the footsteps of the Jews and the Christians. They have supported those who are at war with the Muslims. They have delayed/forgotten the Islamic Law, and instead they are ruling by man-made law. They have transgressed all bounds of equity all over their lands, and brought about great corruption therein. They have stolen and looted the Islamic Nation's capacities and their resources. And they have done this by putting their trust in their Satanic soldiers, who fight only for worldly gains. Those (soldiers) who are satisfied with the oppression of their people and their tribes, those who participated in the injustices of the Jews and Christians, and those who are working as agents for the Jews and the Christians, solely to obtain a financial reward. And in particular the spies who are still helping the Jews and the Christians, as well as the Arab Apostates. They are the ones who give information to the enemy so they may locate the Believers. They give the American army the locations where they can strike the Mujahideen and the Muslims. They are spying on the Islamic Nation in different ways to achieve their objectives, helping the West with their war against the Islamic Nation. Our Islamic Nation has suffered a lot, and continues to suffer from this filthy disease that is running through the veins of the Islamic Nation. They are the cancer that is killing the Islamic Nation from inside, so beware of them! May Allah destroy them! How perverted are their minds! Allah, the Almighty, has comforted us with a blessed operation through which we encountered those filthy spies, and we captured one of them, in the Province of Ma'arib. His name is (Major) Bassam Sulaiman Tarbush Sharjabi, and he is one of the spies who was helping the enemy; through his spying on the Muslims in general, and the Mujahideen in particular. He was leading a network of spies, and he was recruiting some youngsters from the tribal areas to spy on the Muslims. He has provided us with the names and personal details of the other spies. And he has told us about how the network works, and how they recruit people to spy on the Muslims and the Mujahideen. Some of the spies he told us about are from well-known tribes, who do not accept this kind of behavior towards the Islamic Nation. And we will not announce the names of these people, because we don’t want to cause any harm to the tribes that they belong to. And by the grace of Allah, we have implemented the Islamic ruling by killing this spy. So that he will be an example for the people who will see this. Interrogation: Q: Your name? A: My name is Bassam Sulaiman Tarbush Sharjabi. Q: Your profession? A: I am the Director of the Research Department in Ma`arib. Q: How long have you worked there? A: 14 years, 10 of those years in Ma'arib. Q: How many people did you recruit during that time? A: We recruited people from the tribal areas, and people from outside the provinces. Q: And you have given us the names of those people? A: Yes, you have written down all the names of those people. Q: What was your current assignment? A: To collect information, contact the Minister of Internal Affairs and keep him informed of the situation. Q: Did you have any exclusive sources? A: Exclusive sources? Yes, all of the officials had some private/exclusive sources. Q: How did you choose the people you recruited to work with you?? A: First of all, I looked at them, to see if they were people whom I could trust. And of course they need to have some capabilities. Q: Those who work with you, are they usually smart or stupid people? A: By Allah, most of them are stupid people! Q: The filthy government of Ali Abdullah, are they ruling by the Islamic Law? A: No, no, no! They are ruling by man-made laws, not Shariah! Q: The filthy government of Ali Abdullah, did you know they are agents of the Americans? A: Yes, it's clear that they are puppets of the American government. They meet with each other, and have conversations. They have established a lot of security bases, so that they can attack the Mujahideen. Q: How did we capture you? A: I was selling alcohol to someone. Q: Your last advice to your colleagues? A: My advice to my colleagues is not to be drawn into such deeds, and to stop spying on to the Mujahideen. Q: And your advice to those you recruited? A: I advise them to stay away from this work, and return to their previous way of life, and repent to Allah before they end up sitting in my place one day. And I am very sorry for this. Some people of the tribal areas are in contact with the Intelligence service of the Saudi government. And I have named them to the Mujahideen. Q: And what do you advise them? A: I advise them with the same advice I gave my colleagues, and the people I recruited; I also advise them to stay away from this work, and return to their previous lives, and repent to Allah before they end up sitting in my place one day. And I advise them to stop helping the Americans, and the Mossad with locating the Mujahideen and capturing the righteous Believers. Speech Before Killing the Spy: All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds! And peace and blessings be upon the Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family, and his Companions, and on those who follow them rightfully until the Day of Judgement. To proceed: Your Mujahideen brothers on the Peninsula of the Prophet (peace be upon him) managed to capture this filthy criminal Apostate spy, who has been for 14 years waging war against Allah, and his Messenger, and the Believers. And expelling the Mujahideen! And spreading corruption! And selling alcohol! And now here is today, getting his just reward at the hands of the Mujahideen! "All power belongs to Allah, His Messenger and the Believers: but the hypocrites know not" (63:8) The Mujahideen killed the Apostate To conclude: We say to those who are working as spies to harm the Mujahideen, or to help the Apostates in various places to harm the Mujahideen. Or trying to collect a reward if they managed to kill one of us. You will not escape the punishment we are preparing for you, with the help of Allah! And the Mujahideen will get you wherever you go, and even if it takes a very long time, still you will not manage to escape. And oppression is not one of the pillars of the Mujahideen, and they do not like to be oppressed themselves. So the door of repentance is open for anyone who wants to repent, so don’t wait too long, until it is too late and remorse will not help you, for then you will taste the torment of the Hereafter.
