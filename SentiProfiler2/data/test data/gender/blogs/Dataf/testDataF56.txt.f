Living with roommates is a very unique experience. However it is up to you how you go about it. Your house can be like a hotel with different people staying in it, minding their own business, cooking for themselves or it can be a wonderful, funny place. A real home away from home. That happens when you make an effort to connect with your roomies and make it a point to do some things together. My seniors have always managed to cheer me up every time I felt down. Life here for me has been filled with moments of homesickness. Disappointments. Depression. Hunger. Financial crunch... And yet I laugh at most times and bury myself in work at the other times. A bunch of seniors who have helped me out since the day i landed are...  Life is fast right now. I wake up each day and by the time I crash down again, all is a blur. I still can't digest that it has been two whole months since I boarded that flight from Muscat and arrived at Chicago- not knowing a soul here! Life gets tough once in a while but i find myself laughing more than ever thanks to these people :)  As the song goes- its the climb!
