In her book editor days, Janet Hill Talbert edited books like Having It All?: Black Women and Success by Veronica Chambers, Gumbo: A Celebration of African American Writing edited by Marita Golden and E. Lynn Harris and Crowns: Portraits of Black Women in Church Hats by Michael Cunningham and Craig Marberry. She also sent one of the loveliest rejection letters I have ever received ("This is exactly the type of book that I would love to publish but...)  She even followed up with a phone call! She is a jewelry designer now and she has a new inspirational line of jewelry called On This Rock, inspired, as she puts it, by her love of words and The Word from the Bible.  The jewelry is made from sterling silver, brass, beach stones and other materials.  My favorites are the cuffs, especially the ones featuring "The Lord's Prayer" and Psalm 23.  Perhaps I will wear one of them for good luck the next time I send out a book proposal.  And say a prayer... 
I can hardly believe that Josie Natori almost opened a chain of McDonald's franchises instead of becoming a designer, but it's true.  Even after becoming the first female Vice President of Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch in the 1970s,  Josie was anxious to take on an entrepreneurial venture in the tradition of her grandmother, a venerable businesswoman in her own right. 

The result is Natori, her now 32-year-old success story.  The label began with lingerie and has since expanded into fragrance, home, eyewear and ready-to-wear. I was very excited meet Josie at her home to on Manhattan's Upper East Side, thrown by yet another entrepreneurial diva, The Creatrix of Purple Lab cosmetics, Karen Robinovitz.  The occasion was to introduce her new collection, Natori Essentials.   Social Media evangelist that I am, I was thrilled to see that Josie was so enthusiastic and interested in jumping into the new media world!  While her staff maintains @NatoriCompany, Josie maintains a blog, Josie's Thoughts, and tweets herself at @JosieNatori.  She even commandeered my BlackBerry so I could show her a few new tricks on Ubertwitter!
