From the day1 of my coll life i seein him. he's very silent and very sensitive.. silent but cant with stand his comment. i made the mistake of tellin him the dialogue durin first sem exam. he made the dialogue a highlight for these four days. we're room mates durin second year and we won BEST ROOM AWARD for tat year. from this all can understand we both make a perfect combination. as a true friend he's been with me for all time for suggestion or for entertain or for carin.. many times we both ve same character.. you can hear a typical tirupur speech when he talk with his dad.. he has faced lotta prob in fourth year and end of third year but too he managed well.. nice lad lookin silent all the time(like fittin silencer as said in boys flim).. noone can understand his inner feelings.. i thanked to god to get such a friendship in my life time... ALL THE BEST. i'm always there for you for anything and at anytime...
