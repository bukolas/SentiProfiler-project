Never bunked like he used to, cared a lot abt attendance.
After telling so much abt hari, if i don't mention abt his walk & smile-its a cardinal sin:-))
There r many fans for d way he smiles & walks. Many try 2 imitate him rather with no success. 
An ardent fan of Vijay. However worse d movie is, watches it 1st day 1st show (ena koduma sir ithu?)
Then he is a flutist & knows karate (ithelema avane sonathu, none has seen him in action)
keeps singing one song r d othr during class hours (mayb tats d reason many lecturers leave d class asap:-p)
joined a gym recently & improved his strength immensly (tat was 2 kick guys like me, i guess-was lucky nt 2 get kicked thouhgh) wears tight shirts & t shirts (u know y)
Anyway this just a glimpse of what Hari is! L try covering him, maybe later sometime
It was wonderful knowing u man:)

I am afraid I dont agree with you! with your suggestions it will become congress 2! why do we want another congress pretender? Office holders and tickets should be only given to people who succeed on an internal competition irrespective of caste or religion what you have proposed is internal reservations to christians musllims OBC's and dalits! a shadow cabinet is a good idea! The important change we need is NO wishywashy principles they should nail their colours to the mast and campaign for uniform civil code, abolition of sec 370, abolition of caste politics, abolition of minority appeasement abolition of reservations and sops, and treat ALL indians equal!
A real sport..but beware..she will give back as much as what she takes...she has this intimidating aura about her..in TV rating terms..she is strictly not for the weak hearted..but once you get to know her from close quarters,she is so down to earth..she is well conversant with high quality English as well as petta baashai..I have never seen her turn sentimental.. even if someone tries to ..she just laughs it off..of late she has become one of my most trusted friend, philosopher,guide,confidant all rolled into one..( I bet she will giggle even for this)...she is someone whom I instinctively message or call when I am feeling low..she can really life your spirits up in no time.. has a good dressing sense..presents herself aptly..she is BOLD,BEAUTIFUL,CONFIDENT,TOUGH and different from most people that I have met.. she is an enigma.. hate her or love her.. you just can't ignore her..all the best KAVYA RAJAPPA.. and KEEP FIGHTING!:)

Had been on a cabin trip weekend of Sep 20th. The cabin was about 2 ½ hours drive from Seattle. What started out as a 10 person trip eventually came down to 4. You know how these things go. People dropping out at the last minute with some excuse or the other. I also tried my best to get out of it but with no luck. What was my excuse – well I had none – that was the problem. I have no complaints now. It was four guys in a cabin all by ourselves. Now don't jump ahead of yourselves and get the wrong idea.

acted in my first play when I was 9 (4th standard) - I was playing a Malayali traveling in a train as part of a skit on National Integration. One of these days, I will scan the picture from the play and post it here for all of you to have a hearty laugh on how silly boys with lipstick look and how terrible primary school teachers are in putting makeup. And fortunately for me, I have been doing at least one play every year ever since - through school, college, and ignoring a brief hiatus while I was in France, throughout my professional life as well (Incidentally, 2008 was the first year I didn't do a play since I landed in Bangalore). .
i feel that sijo is the most understanding and most wonderful friend i have ever had in my life...a man who takes every thing in the right spirit & also some one who helps me a lot every time when i am in troble.........
i am sure sucess will step with you in whatever you do.
God bless you.
The next morning when Swapna logged in she had forgotten completely about the surprise and they were chatting about random things as the conversation went by. Ram did not bother to remind her either. Swapna quickly typed, “We are going to have a huge bash for Anisha’s birthday tomorrow at her place. We couldn’t have a party that day ‘cos she had plans with her family.” Ram exclaimed, “Wow, that’s awesome sweety…. So, you are gonna be at her place all day tomorrow eh?”. Swapna giggled to herself and replied, “Why do you ask like you’re going to come to the party? ;)” Ram sighed heavily on the other side and keyed in, “How I wish babe… how I wish……” They continued and she went on and on about what she had planned for the party. Ram was missing all the action and he felt bad about it. Ram typed out in frustration, “Damn! Semester ended yesterday and if only I could afford to get to India :( :(.” Swapna asked anticipating a positive response, “Is there no way you can come now?” Ram made a quick and short reply, “Nope.” Swapna was now asking Ram what else they could do. Swapna asking him for some ideas for the party. Ram said his mood wasn’t ok and he logged off. Swapna tried to persuade him to stay, but, he refused and left. Swapna was missing him online and she was suddenly reminded of the surprise that he had promised. She was now very curious to know what it was and she called him. The conversation was very terse. Ram answered the call and in a very depressed tone replied, “I will call you tomorrow. I know you were reminded of the surprise I promised you. I’ll let you know tomorrow. Waiting at times increases the value of the surprise. Hold on to your curiosity sweety.” Without waiting for her to reply, he hung up.

He's cool . never gets tensed..
Humorous ..But very cunning person..
Use to be a gud boy in Skool days . He is one of my best friends .we ver class mates in skool. Likes to criticize everyone.

But the stock market crashed once the interim budget turned out to be a damp squib. What else would you expect from a substitute (Pranab) of a substitute (Manmohan) of a substitute (Chidambaram)? It should have been Manmohan all along.

In his defense, Pranab argued that he did not have the mandate do anything more with the budget. No mandate? Does this mean Prakash Karat is the one we should be blaming?

Pranab termed his interim budget as one for the ‘aam admi’. Unfortunately, for the ‘aam admi’, the government is now the ‘baam admi’.

Did you read about that? A farmer in Rajasthan claims that an Army aircraft bombed his 5 bhiga field and home. No statements from the Army. Guess the IAF’s policy is not to ‘kisaan-and-tell’. Or it’s in a real kisaan jam. Or it doesn’t think it’s that bhig-a deal. Take your pick.
well this guy does not like if u call him praveen or kumar..likes being called sakthi.. well he is one of the sweetest person i have ever met.. he is a kind hearted , humble , helpful person.. i get stunned by the way he talks to elders respects his parents and elders ..one more thing is thet i hav never seen him get angry ..has a smily face.. he is one perfect roommate who u can get.very helpful. he is a very soft person.. well on the whole a great human being and one of my best friends.. friends for ever .. cheers dude
Ya true that she doesnt spend a lot of time with me talking but there was this magical time in the bus ride from kulu to simla,wen we actually started talking ,ill vote it as my best moment with her cannot forget that never ever,Really got to know her as a mature , a bit more stable and strong head dudette then from the rather clumsy, always cheering ,gleeful self that she seems the rest of the time... Beware she is nothing as she projects herself to be the beautifull dimpled smile can have a lot of meaning he he he .
She's got a lot of policies governing herlself but that doesnt keep her from enjoyin life to max... seriously!! she is one whose absense will dampen any group's mood.And as for ur warning against me not keeping in touch u don have to worry abt it i aint gonna do the same mistake of letting time wit u slip away as i did earlier.
Keep smiling u will always be same jayashree tat i know ,cos there is nothing where u can improve u're so perfect .... Keep smiling Rok on... U better keep in touch :)
shanki as i call him has been more than a friend to me rite from the time i met him in 6th standard..it has been 10 years since we met ...and through those ten years i ahve always had a friend with whom i could confide even the deepest of secrets...he knows me better than i myself do...thats the truth...
i have never seen him in a serious mood except on the field ...there he is a tough competitor and a shrewd cricketing brain....i lve the way he plays the game and had been lucky to play once under him in a very serious match...;) 
u stay with him for half an hour and he will surely come up with soem prank and bring u down with laughter...
we ahd together roamed the length n breadth of adambakkam n the surrounding suburbs...and those days would remain evergreen in my memory...
ok......hi dear so today i thought lemme tell ur other frnds abt my opinion abt you....the person reading this testimonial plzzzzzzzz note that the person for whom i have wriiten this testimonial is the "Best" frnd ever anyone can have in his...or...her life....she is stpuid and also sweet she gets scared from many unusual things ......but she takes care of everyone to the fullest.....i met her in Delhi and till date i m waiting eagerly to send some time together....yaaar she is almost similar to a small kid using all johnson products......and she is my first love......(not a joke but not in a wrong sense tooo mind it)....i miss u anu ....hope we meet up soon dear anyways take care honey u r the best......love u but just to say honey "I MISS YOU"...
Hi I am writing this to one of my Best Friend and with whom i share most of my persona;l problems(I think he knows everything about me).He is a person who is having an easy take and easy go life.I can say that he is An apt person in this fast world.he has got a very great attitude and ambition and i feel that he will soon be a succesful enterprenur.everyone sees in him "the comedy nature" but only few know his 
serious life.. i think he is one of the best coders that i have ever seen.he has never reacted sensitivily to the comments laid by others and thats his plus.... all the best macha.....You are really great.
O'Brien got the live show started as a way to help his staff of about 40 keep busy and employed. NBC gave up an extra $12 million for the staff. Considering that the staffers uprooted their families and pulled their kids out of schools in New York and moved them across the country -- only to see NBC end Conan's Tonight Show run after only seven months, they deserve whatever extra gig they can get until O'Brien resurfaces behind a desk for another network.

In New York, the tour hits Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden in June, venues that sold out quickly. Hey, maybe Conan will return to Gotham when he lands the next job. Things were going great for him until he left.
I n pravin wer skool classmates, Very cool guy.. never gets tensed.. Very quiet. Enjoys roaming around in our home town. Gud companion while roaming, We also take "the terror" Janesh and "Dirty dog" Alan and "Raddy" Pradesh n Praveen with us.. Used to Play cricket very well.. He bats stylish and Bowls like mc'grath. Girls define him as sweet person.. has a lot of fans due to his character...
Between 2 friends, maybe very close or may not be close, they could just be friends. Assume that the guy has feelings for the gal all of a sudden. Like I said before, the guy decides to tell her. "Hey, I have started feeling differently about u lately... blah blah.... this is off topic" The gal if interested says 'Yes' and all is ll. OMG here comes the other if. NO??!!?? Ok now wats the next step. I have commonly seen the gal starting to distance herself from the guy. Cmon give him a break he is not gonna stalk you. Guys give her a break. She said NO which means any amount of hanging around doesnt work. So give up and atleast be sane enough to respect her feelings and her space.

If you are very close friends, give it a small gap, may be one or 2 days, call back and just be normal. DO NOT ATTEMPT to talk about wat happened unless u r sure, both u and her are comfortable talking about it. Otherwise, its best to avoid it. Agreed it is tough to start with. A few days, and u will be back to comfort zone and then probably, u will be able to discuss it in the lighter vein.

Ok, here goes. What is it about expressing love that people think its an offense? The guy had an 'opinion'. I use the word opinion just because its just precisely what it is. You go thro this phase where you think a person is special to you. Hence, its an 'OPINION' you form about the person. Freedom of Speech/ Expression(This I know is not applicable completely to something of this kind) but, I want to use this to play down the misconceptions surrounding the 'Opinion'.

The girl, you will accept/not accept an opinion about a car, bike, house, etc...etc... when the guy says it. Why is it when this opinion is expressed and then asked about ur take on it... you get so offensive??
He just said he loves you and wants you to be his 'ONE'. Just say whether you agree or not and get moving along. Yes, again a play down on the whole concept of expressing love.
James Bobin is on board to direct the movie, the plot of which is under wraps. The TV show as well as some of the movies tended to have one key human actor with whom the Muppets associated on their adventures. It is known that Segel plays a man on a quest to find and reunite the Muppets.

The actor's coming aboard is a natural extension of the development process; he wrote the script with pal Nicholas Stoller.

Segel has been on a tear with feature work of late. He recently boarded the Cameron Diaz comedy "Bad Teacher" and last week signed to star with Ed Helms in the Duplass brothers' latest movie, "Jeff Who Lives at Home."
The Universe already loves you. Love it back by loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are. 
May be the 'love it back' is interpreted by the *&^%#@ THEY' in their own way.!!
If we are we always and not harm others....thats life i supose. Corectaa?
I suffered a lot in my life bcos of those "%&*(& THEY" and so i stopped worrying about them long time back. Sometimes i think what so far i have earned by having a concern for those "naalu peru" ?
Its bcos of your individuality and courage i admire you always.
In fact, there was a scene here that reminded me of another good movie - Mullholland Drive - that bared and flaunted a specific multiple-interpretation scene to needlessly and abruptly drop a hint rather in the middle of the movie. When you use a scene as a hint dropper and not a narrative driver, you give away the ending. (This is the scene where this aspiring actress meets a cowboy in a boxing ring). The movie was significantly less interesting after that point. That scene was disconnected, random and unreal. The entire movie was like that. But that scene was a little bit more of all that than it needed to be.
Since only a few Indian universities has met the international standards.Its a welcome decission from the govt. As a result our universities will have to face a tough competion for their survival which will raise the quality of our education substantially. And more of our students will get oppurtunity to acquire quality education without the need of going abroad.

but few concerns will be

Since ultimately people in India want quality of education be raised to be more competitive in this world till we are able to stannd on our knees. For that we would like a foregin help but after we stand we should be able to take the charge off. That dosent mean it should be Use & Throw policy.

my suggetions:

1. It shold be a treaty of more than policy or business.
2. It will be better to merge maximum number than letting to open new ones.


Since education will draw the future India.
From the day1 of my coll life i seein him. he's very silent and very sensitive.. silent but cant with stand his comment. i made the mistake of tellin him the dialogue durin first sem exam. he made the dialogue a highlight for these four days. we're room mates durin second year and we won BEST ROOM AWARD for tat year. from this all can understand we both make a perfect combination. as a true friend he's been with me for all time for suggestion or for entertain or for carin.. many times we both ve same character.. you can hear a typical tirupur speech when he talk with his dad.. he has faced lotta prob in fourth year and end of third year but too he managed well.. nice lad lookin silent all the time(like fittin silencer as said in boys flim).. noone can understand his inner feelings.. i thanked to god to get such a friendship in my life time... ALL THE BEST. i'm always there for you for anything and at anytime...
The second installment of Stephenie Meyer's hugely popular and successful Twilight franchise did exactly what it set out to do: capitalize on its pre-existing fanbase and deliver more vampire/human/werewolf romantic intrigue. Though it only scored an overall 28% on the Tomatometer (compared to the first movie's 50% rating), The Twilight Saga: New Moon was a box office success, making close to $300 million. The story follows the continuing adventures of everygirl Bella Swan, whose vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen leaves town in order to keep Bella safe from his enemies;
My sweeeeeeeeeeeet sister..The lines may seem a bit clichéd to readers, but yes she is one sort of person I wud love to be with at all times ...Gone are the days when she asks me to imitate the college profs and crack pjs or rather mokkais and enjoy the scene..I get reminded of all those when I am all alone, dipped in an ocean of solitude missing the dearer ones.... One of the many people whom I miss badly right now......Missssssssssssss u a lot........And testimonials written truly with heart, out of affection generally have a bad and an incomplete ending....And I guess this fits well in such a category..........Will continue writing further..............
First of all, the IPL is made for India. It won't work as well anywhere else. India has a billion people who are absolutely cricket-mad. The owners of the franchises are Indian and wealthy, the sponsors mainly are Indian, there are lots of Indian players and it's an Indian TV channel that has put its money in. I don't think any other country could do it so well even if it tried. The authorities in England were talking about it a year ago but they can't do it so well. The main thing about the IPL is that it is fun, it is pure entertainment, and it's Bollywood - or Hollywood, call it what you want. The great thing is that the catchment area for these franchises is so huge that nobody else can compete with that. It will always be better in India.
He is one of the most interesting ppl in my life...well we met at a tech symposium Aarush-SRM univ,but it seemed we had been friends for life,he could have been the better judge for the events sparing the SRM staff with his impeccable knowledge on a diverse range of topics,and flabbergasted everyone with his tech-trivia! Lol .. a prodigy i wud say.....this word sums up this good friend of mine,ten years down the lane,u wud be a gr8 prof (swear my head upon it!),and ur zeal for knowledge will take u to greater zeniths ! All the best dood,i know u are one of the best in my journey ! Rock on...
Hi Jai, Paaru unna pathi ellam ezhutha vendiyatha iruku. "Romba amaithiyaana ponnunga iva" ippadi ellorum sollanumnu avalukku romba aasai athukaaga romba kashta pattu nadipaa. Romaba nalla padippa. I am Very proud to have a sister like her. Really admired and sometimes Jealous about her commitment. Ellorukkum AVA KANNU mela oru kannu. Ava photoku nalla pose kudupa, will soon upload those in orkut. As she wrote in my testimonial she is my main target for kidding. But many times I have saved her when others try to make fun of her. Umm I heard that she is a good singer and dancer but I am not fortunate to hear her voice or see her dancing still. Very good daughter to her parents. I have never seen her upset at anytime takes everything positively. Ippo romba nalla Whistle adikara. Padam paakum bothu thaan iva evvalavu suru surupa iruppaanu therium. BUBBLY JAI All the best for your future. May ur dream comes true. From ur everloving BROTHER :)
What is the logic behind bringing Hema Malini, Smriti Irani? What is (not are) their contrinution towards developing India? Just for the sake of bringing young and women in the party executive body, i think Mr. Gadkari forgot that when it comes to election this team would not be able to stand and win seats for BJP candidates in front of much more credible names like Mr. Chidambaram, Mr. M. S. Ahluwalia, our dear Prime Minister, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Manu Singhavi. Mrs. S. Gandhi. Varun Gandhi has already shown that he has no solutions to finght poverty and upbringing the life style of people at least in areas near Pilibhit and he is now promoted...good Mr Gadkari. but as an old RSS swayam sevak, who has run Shakha for RSS in UP, i feel cheated and so does the country if BJP is a national party and promisses of a better india. I would have been more happy to see people like Modi, Raman Singh and Sivraj Singh Chauhan, Yashvant Sinha whom people can trust. Even if we want to give you opportunity to run the country in next election, we do not see credible names whom we people of india could trust the way we trust PC, MM. Rahul Gandhi has not delivered any thing till now but he shows a progressive mind and the way he is taking his career forward gives an impression that he is interested in inclusive growth despite been from the most power full family. while u are selecting people who are good at laughing, dancing, saas-bahu natak.....and no plans for a better india. U have delivered a lot for Mumbai and Maharashtra, still i can't understand that u chose this team. May be excellence and delivery were not ur primary parameters while selecting ur team and u are also convinced that PC and MM could take better care of the nation and are better people who can take India to the next level.

Gud luck to u & ur team Mr. Gadkari. i will be happy to see my self defeated for my feedback and if u win, i will go to Sidhivinayak that u could deliver for the country.
For the last couple, maybe three weeks I have become crazy watching movies during the weekends. I just turn on the television and start watching the movie that is currently playing, usually its one of the cute ones with Steve Martin, Sanjay Dutt, Paresh Rawal or Lindsay Lohen.
The anoo files:) part2: well to b really frank i dint know much abt tis gal wen i wrote the 1st testi for her...but now i ve learnt a lot abt her and from her :) one very interestin thing tat i would lik to say is dat she has bcome a very close frend of mine oly recently... esp after joinin Cognizant...i should mention she has grown up to b a very matured gal..i was surprised by the fact tat she trusted me so much dat she told me many of her secrets and personal matters :D...thanks for dat man :)to b very frank no other person has been lik dat to me....and definitely she also took some pains to understand a complex person lik me :) v ve shared a lot of things abt each other and she s one person who knows me really well :) and wenever v meet v ve sometin to talk abt, either abt ourselves or abt others[gossip i mean ;)]... she is def one of the sweetest and cutetest :) gals i ve come across..and one of the few ppl who supports me and tells good things abt me.... thanks for all dat, i really appreciate it :)

It’s Holi. The festival of colours. The one day politicians can change shades every minute with no questions asked. Ominous signs for the BJP – no takers for the saffron dyes.

No one was spared. Even LK Advani was left red-faced at the end of the day. But it had nothing to do with Holi. Just that all his allies are bailing on him at the last minute.

Speaking of which, Naveen Patnaik is facing another flood crisis in Orissa. This time around, his office has been inundated with frantic calls from every single Prime Ministerial candidate in the Third Front.

Its ridiculous how everyone in the Third Front is considering himself / herself PM material. Having said that, its good to have choices. Last time, we had to pick between an Italian and someone who’d never won a Lok Sabha seat.

The scary part? Mayawati has thrown her hat in the ring. She is virtually holding the Left Parties to ransom threatening to leave the Front if she is not nominated. Am slowly starting to buy into the whole karma philosophy.
I can't help it. I have a fascination with dogs that are larger than their owners; it makes me laugh every single time. This isn't the best photo that I took yesterday at 89th St and Park Ave. ... but I think you can see that the lady in the picture can't be much taller than five feet while her pet, standing on its hind legs, would probably be about a foot taller. She could ride him home! Jimmy Fallon ( who gave me a high five once ) and his family were asked to leave Posto Pizza (at 18th and 2nd in New York City) after they interpreted a public statement made by Fallon as a slight against their establishment -- Fallon clarified he likes the Pizza, he just felt they did not belong in the competition he was discussing because their crust is super thin as opposed to the others. Regardless, he and his family got the boot as the owners laughed and laughed. Via Jimmy Fallon's Twitter When I first started writing popular cuture I used to write "Top Ten Lists" of prominent actors' back catalogue of films. I think the first one I wrote was Tom Cruise -- as kind of a tongue-in-cheek joke I selected one of his more infamous movies as number one. This guy takes that same movie to a whole new level : (psst: I think it's The Natural . Yes, definitely The Natural .) From Mouthpiecesports via The Will Leitch Experience I have no idea if he was a comedian, but someone died in New York today. Here's the deal: I get terrible reception on my cell phone in my apartment, so, on a day like today when I have an interview to conduct, I venture over to Carl Schurz Park -- which is between the East River and East End Avenue around 87th Street. While I was there today all hell broke loose. Apparently, someone jumped into the river and a large portion of the NYPD arrived by land, sea and air. Along with the Coast Guard, FDNY and the Justice League of America. Yes, I watched. Did I feel bad? Not really. Did I feel like I was in the movie Stand by Me and was about to see Ray Brower's body? Yes. Well, they never found the body, he his apparently still floating down the East River somewhere. Here are the photos of the action before everyone got bored and went home. Hey guys: I will be tweeting my ass off about the SNL visit tonight. So, good time as ever to sign up and follow, right? FOLLOW MIKE ON TWITTER Two quick points: Carter Bays, this week, who is one of the creators of How I Met Your Mother , told Entertainment Weekly that, "At the end of the season, we will address the title of the show." Well, then. I'm not sure what to think of this. I'm sure it's just a tease but think of how many shows drop in quality after a revel (which I will go on record saying will not fully happen this season). Remember those old Burger King ads asking who Herb was? The only person who had never tried a Whopper. Remember when they revealed Herb and how successful Herb was to the Burger King franchise? Me either. Regardless, is this a good thing? Also, I'm not going to mention who, but, a certain SNL featured player -- who will forever be known in my apartment as "Most Awesome Person Ever" -- invited me to watch this upcoming Saturday's show from the writers room. And yeah, Tracy Morgan is hosting; I'm sure it will be a subdued affair. My god, this may turn out to be the greatest experience of my life. Hey, I'll be tweeting that day . (At least a couple, I've been to television tapings before; cell phones are frowned upon.) If you haven't yet: sign up and be one of my six followers ! Remember that episode of Seinfeld when Kramer mistakenly gets called into a business meeting even though he didn't actually work there. I think I may be hoping this somehow happens to me. "Hey, we need something right now ... come on, get in here, what are you waiting for?" I don't quite understand it, but yes, I'm now using Twitter . Perhaps this will be a solution to my lack of original blogging; perhaps not. Regardless, if you so choose to follow me , please do at your own risk ... I have no idea what I am doing.
Hey finally PureDistortion has moved to its very own site. It is at www.puredistortion.com. This blog will stay up and have all of the archived posts here from before the move. they will be avaliable at puredistortion.blogger.com and blog.puredistortion.com Dale Finally the local game store is getting into the Wizards of the coast game Magic the Gathering and stocking some of the cards. For me this is really cool as this is a game that I have always been interested in but no one in my social circles played at all. Also I think it is a game that my wife could really get into as well which would be cool as the continual smackdown I get in card games like Uno, SkipBo and Phase10 are beginning to wear a bit thin LOL. So with this motivation I have been looking into how the game works as I have only ever had a couple of goes at the game in shops as demos and came a cross a series of online videos done by Wizards that are really great at explaining the game and how it works. I ahve only supplied links or else this post would be massive LOL. This is a 6 part series that is titled "Learn to play Magic the Gathering": (links to each video are the part 1 ect links) PART 1: Is an introduction to Magic and the decks and how to get started. PART 2: Is an explanation on the cards them selves. PART 3: Is about the different types of cards that will be in your deck. PART 4: Is all about the turn sequence and a basic turn. PART 5: Is all about attacking and blocking. PART 6: Deck building and the stratergies. Another thing that the guys at Wizards do is they supply the rules online so that you can get down to your hobby store get a starter deck and get straight into playing you can get a copy of the rules straight from the website there are also link to other helpful playing resources such as the gatherer . The Gatherer is an online database of all of the cards available so you can study up on you opponent or hunt out your next rare purchase/trade. Also check out www.magicthegathering.com there is heaps of stuff on there. On Dakka Dakka today found a link to a site called armyroster.com . Army Roster is a web based army builder that is now looking for people for Beta accounts to test the site and provide feedback and bugs. I creatd an account on the site and went through and started to build a 1500pt list for my Orc and Goblin Fantasy army (at the moment Warhammer Fantasy lists are all that can be created) and found the interface nice and simple to use, though it did not have the AJAX web2.0 feel that I had come to expect from web applications these days. Now apart from the feel there were a few more things that annoyed me, the basic functionality was not complete yes so links that were in the site would go to error pages and also the lists for the Fantasy Armies were incomplete with me not being able to add in things that are in the army book. Also the need for the site to be all linked in as a community was also something that annoyed me (fro no real reason) and this is something that I have issues with more and more new generation web apps providing a service have to try and shoe horn in community tools like forums into the site when forums already exist for the subculture that they are aiming at, I believe that these developers hould focus more on building intergration with existing services. Though I must say when the opponent finder... one of the broken bits of the site... is working I think this will be a great way for people to find other people in the local area to find opponents. Now with those points aside this site has real potential to be a real competitor to Army Builder especially if they build on a few little bits of functionality. For example the site already validates your core choice requirements and total points but not charater magic items. The ability for people to be able to view your avaliable armies via a URL so that you can link to your profile in a forum. Also the ability to import your own army spec files for games that army roster does not currently supprt would also be an awesome idea and take some load off the developers doing data entry for every game that they wish to support. Though overall I think when this app gets out of Beta... and I am griping about a site that is in very early Beta at the moment... it will be an awesome site that will be a serious alternative to Army Builder and free. So check out armyroster.com and keep an eye on it as when it is up and running I think it will be a great web app. I know I will be using it. Found an interesting solution for users of plesk/qmail for how to identify a user who is abusing your authenticated SMTP service. Running the command: cat /var/log/messages | grep -i smtp_auth | grep "logged in" | awk {' print $11 '} | awk -F / {' print $6"@"$5 '} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail or: cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i smtp_auth | grep "logged in" | awk {' print $11 '} | awk -F / {' print $6"@"$5 '} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail Depending on your Linux Distro and you will get an output like the example bellow: 7 user@example.com 7 someone@spmewhere.net.au 8 stuff@onthenet.com.au 8919 user@crackeddomain.com.au As you can see the account 'user' for the domain 'crackeddomain.com.au' are having unusually high amounts of SMTP connections for an account. This is useful for tracking bulk email being sent through your system or hijacked accounts being used by spammers. I found this on rackerhacker.com a site by Seinior Rackspace Systems Engineer Major Hayden, go and check it out it is full of awesome content. With all of the talk going on on the net and in main stream media about the new "Great Firewall of Australia" ISP spam filter I though I should have my say. Firstly I think that this is ridiculous especially when the report that has been released regarding there 30 user test in Tasmania.... 30 user how the hell does 30 users represent Australia's traffic, maybe that is the amount of users that dont download MP3's or movies, but it is not a decent representation of the traffic this country generates. Also the reports suggest that internet link costs will go up due to the cost of implementation and the speed of the link will be slower. Apart from this just making no sence at all why should someone decide for me what is relevant for me to view on the net (now Mr Conroy I am not a pedophile or a terroist) as filters miss one big factor..... context. How can a filter that only sees a request to a server on port 80 judge if i am looking at a site of "potentially" harmful information such as euthinasia to kill my self or I am writing a ballanced document about both sides of the topic.. in shor it can't and if some one is looking in this example for a way to kill themselves they will find it one way or another you aren't going to stop them. Also with the filtering being done at the ISP level what is going to stop the ISP tracking your data and selling it to marketing firms in some way or another and this dosent have to be a company as a whole, it could be just an enterprising engineer working in the back end. This senario gets even worse when some if the technologies have the ability to decrypt and inspect SSL traffic the same traffic that used by internet banking and sites online.. can you say the death of online shopping in Australia. Another thing to consider is not only will we be told what not to view but these decisions will cause false positive removing "legitimate" that we should be entitled to see. Also what stops the logical progression of an anoymous filtering tool becoming a tracking tool so it is logged where your IP has been or that a government would use the filter to block content that is contrary to there views and opinions. It is all possible just look to the harsh filtering of there internet users by there government. Finially with this solution costing Millions and Millions and can be simpily avoided by using one of the many tools avaliable today. Proxies, TOR, VPN, Web Anonimisers all have the ability to bypass this technology so people who are looking at this dodgy content still will be able to as ISP's will not be able to block these technologies as that would serverly hamper Australian businesses. In the end if it does come in to Australia I will be starting a buisnes soffering VPN solutio, help stop one of the greatest free speah injustices in this lifetime.ns to a data centre in another country to make some cash of all of the dodgy and paranoid people out there. In the end they cant stop what you look at on the net just hamper the growth of the technology sectors of Australia. They would be better spending this money on stopping people in this country creating the content. Please sign the online petition here. Also go to nocleanfeed.com to see what else you can do.

Ill keep updating things as they come up to where this is headed. Wired is doing a piece on all of the winners of there previous photography competitions.

Also check out the gallery of the other winners here. last week Redhat detcted intrusions to certin computer systems. There have been minimal details on the intrusion and what actually has happened as investigations are still happening. RedHat's first concern was the RedHat Network (RHN) and ensuring that their distrobution channel with there clients was intact. I think this is a great move by RedHat acting so swiftly and ensuring that the packages that were in there up2date/yum channels were secure. What was detected was a number ro SSH Service (here is a link to info on SSH) packages were signed and released to channels. In a move to quickly rmove this threat from the channel and customers systems that may have already down loaded and installed the RPM's is to relaease new RPM's into the channels for the affected systems. This is another move that I think is a great move by RedHat as it quickly and elegantly removes these unauthorised packages quickliy from RHEL systems and the update channels, using this method also means that mant people will go without even having the packages installed on there system as RPM (RedHat's package management system) uses versions to controll what packages it downloads and will always download the newr version if it avaliable. The affected versions of RedHat Enterprise Linux are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.5 Extended Update Support. As well as theis there has been a script released by RedHat that will assess weather you system has installed the affected packages and is avaliable from the RedHat website (see link at end of post). I think that this issue has been handled well by RedHat and has showed how simply issues like this can be managed with a solid package management solution such as RPM. It will be interesting to see how this progresses and I will keep an eye on this and keep you updated as news gets out about new updates on the issue. Link to RedHat Security Advisory Link to openssh-blacklist script While trawling through the www.wargamerau.com forums today I came across 2 new things that make the future release of THQ's Dawn of war series looking like something to keep an eye out for. The first is the new trailer that was released yesterday titled 'This world is not ours'. It is amazing and the animators at THQ have done a great job capturing the Warhammer 40k universe. Not only that this trailer is that good it points that Games Workshop really needs to consider making a Full CG Movie based on the 40K world. Though enough ranting check it out: Though this is only the start, not only are THQ pumping out awesome cut scene trailers, but they are also in the process of having a British army FV432 APC cut, chopped and rebuilt into a Space Marine Rhino... I know how cool is that. The TQH Rhino Build Diary announces 'The completed Rhino will be making its public début at Games Workshop Games Day 2008 at the Birmingham NEC on 14th September. Click here for more information or to book tickets for the event.' Unfortunately the Rhino wont be filled with Space Marines but with high end gaming machines that I am assuming that you will be able to have a crack at DoW2 if you are able to get close enough. Check out the Rhino Diary article @ THQ here and the Flikr Diary of photos of the build here. Also keep an eye here at PD as being both a Warhammer and car fan, I will be following the build as it goes on. So if you are going to this event please get in contact with me so that we can get some pics up of the completed Rhino sitting at Games Day.
We're working in the studio now. I'll be posting pictures. Check this space... We boarded the Laurence M. Gould for our journey back on December 23, 2006. Going back through the Gerlache Passage was even more exciting and beautiful than coming the other way. If you look back towards the beginning of the blog, you can see the brilliant day that greeted us in Antarctica. On the way back the day was overcast, with mysterious lines of clouds clinging to the mountains on either side of the passage. I couldn't put down the camera , or if I did, it was to pick up the video camera. I could barely grab a sandwich! As the ship turned away, Palmer Station seemed to fade into the distance. But no sooner was it gone when suddenly the scenery was utterly compelling. We saw whales numerous times, although none with the Canon digital. This combination of granite and fog, ice and water was more mysterious than any landscape I had ever seen. Only the photos of Wang Wusheng come even close. Usually it didn't look sinister but that first picture reminds me of the pilots I have known who joke about granite clouds. The changes happened fast. Focusing on one point sometimes yielded several different photos, both because of the motion of the ship and also the movement of the clouds. The scale of the mountains is not terribly evident in these small photos. But I estimate the cliffs as 30 to 75 meters high. Late in the day we passed Smith Island. Antarctica was retreating in the distance. The low angle of sun had us seeing night for the first time in nearly two months. I wondered how I would react, but I slept so soundly, it was a relief. We had an almost endless sunset that went on for hours. Here is mate, Larry Brissette at the controls. Since there were only five passengers on board, the crew invited us to be in the bridge. Art and I took them up on their offer and spent a good deal of time talking and watching the navigation process as we crossed the Drake. It was so smooth that they were calling it Drake's Lake! Lucky, because we had talked to passengers on a cruise ship that moored at Palmer and they had encountered 10 to 15 meter waves. A part of me would have liked to experience something like that, but the prospect of being tied to my bed for three days was not too appealing. This is how we celebrated Christmas Day. Captain Scott Flanagan gave us a "safety demo" by shooting of flares and letting us shoot some off the stern of the ship. This is the chart and log as we approached Cape Horn. We continued up the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fueg o, Argentina, to the mouth of the Straight of Magellan. Once inside the straight, we met the pilot who guided us into port at Punta Arenas. Somewhere in the Drake Passage I snapped this picture of the ship board computer screen. It was Christmas day, day 359 of the year, 17:04 GMT. Our position was at 55+ degrees South latitude, 64º west longitude. We were headed almost due north 345º with a bearing of 348º, making 11.5 knots of headway. The wind was coming from the due north at 25 or 22 knots (different gauges). Our heading is toward Isla Estados . The salinity of the water was 33.7 (not sure the units), Water temperature was 5.362ºC (up at least 5º from our departure at Palmer.) Depth is 3953 meters (more than 10,000 feet!) Air temp is 10.2ºC. Relative humidity 76%. Wind Chill -1.1ºC. Barometric pressure measured 983.5 millibars. Here is Punta Arenas on our arrival. I was overwhelmed by the color. Just seeing green trees was an intense experience. I like Punta Arenas. It is a stopping over point for many outdoor treks and the town is full of camping stores like North Face and Patagonia. (This is Patagonia , after, all.) Maybe someday I'll come back and explore South America from here. I have a lot to say about Antarctica, what I saw, what I learned. I'll be posting form time to time about the progress on my work in the studio. I hope to display the cast glass along with the photography and video and perhaps some cast ice, as well. I'm just looking for the right venue. I'd still like to post my thoughts on the vast visual input of my ice studies. Another might tackle the implications of global climate change and the vast re-ordering of the earth which is happening under our feet. I'd like to especially than the National Science Foundation for making this magical voyage possible, along with their contractor for Antarctica, Raytheon Polar Services. Everybody was wonderful and more than helpful. I saw more, accomplished more than I ever could have imagined. Some of your comments that were posted also deserve a response. I didn't take full advantage of the blog format, but what a blast this has been! Go Blogger! If you wish to contact me, please write druth@glass.com . I'll try to answer all questions. On the last full day we were at Palmer Station, I wanted to go out in the Zodiac one last time. Art demurred. I think he was looking forward to getting on the Gould and heading home. I wanted to see the one part of the glacier face that we had not been able to see from the Zodiacs. Curt Smith was eager to go. Our technology wizard, he ran the computer network and knew about all the electronics. This channel was created by a collapse of the glacier in 2003 that cut off Old Palmer from the main part of Anvers Island. The channel itself was too narrow to allow boating, because of its nearness to the calving glacier face. But by climbing over Old Palmer we were able to get close and see the new ice. It was worth it because the whole scene was so fresh and pure. Plus it connected the parts we had seen from the boat. The famous skua. Not sure if this is a south polar skua or a brown skua. They are slightly obnoxious birds that are like giant seagulls. The eat penguin eggs and chicks, and are scavengers. Not too popular among the Happy Feet crowd, but hey, a bird's gotta eat! They were very protective of their own nests. Art got a picture of one coming at him dead on, also on Old Palmer. We heard they like to kick as they go by so he ducked, but got the photo anyway. We jumped over a lot of rocks. Its amazing how much of a rubble pile is left in the wake of glacier retreat. My feet, ankles and knees hurt for weeks! We were hoping to take one more look at the ice arch. But a colony of elephant seals had gathered in front of our access. These two young males were wrestling right in our path. We went around them. The Gould had pulled in a day earlier, loading freight from Palmer. It was there to take us home. A bittersweet ending. We deleted ourselves from the computer systems, the lab and our dorm room. All of our stuff was packed and ready to ship. By time I took this picture, they had already loaded our freezer container that had been on the edge of the dock. That night we stayed on the Gould in preparation for leaving the next morning. Dear Friends, I`m travelling in Chile, on the slow route home. I have many great photos yet to post so watch this space sometime after January 5th, 2007. Art and I took many photos in the Gerlache and Neumayer Passages. The day was quite different from the brilliant, cloudless day when we arrived. This one was misty and dramatic. I´ll get to it soon. DAVID We are leaving Palmer Station today, Saturday, December 23, for our four day boat ride on the Laurence M. Gould back to Punta Arenas, Chile. A bittersweet ending, leaving this beautiful place. However, I got what I came for, which was information on how the ice looks. I feel that with the molds and so many photographs I have learned so much. Now I can go home, digest, and start to make my cast glass sculpture. I expect to add a few postings to this blog as I dig out photos and clean them up with Photoshop. (Not to enchance them, so much as to make them more realistic than what the electronic camera thought it saw.) Hang on for a few weeks until I get home. Thank you, everybody, for your support and comments. This has been so fun and I feel invigorated by all your compliments and questions. Please email me at druth@glass.com DAVID RUTH On old Palmer, which is now an island, due to the retreat of the glacier, and the former site of Palmer Station, there is both an ice arch and also an ice cave. We posted pictures of the ice arch before. This time we couldn't get to it because the elephant seals had taken it over. Fifteen or more had come inside, and a few were in the cave itself. A few weeks ago, Jeff found the entrance to the ice cave under the snow and dug it out. I had seen pictures and was eager to get back to Old Palmer but circumstances delayed us for a while. The entrance is small and we had to crawl in. You couldn't stand up, but what a scene. The whole thing is glowing blue green ice, floor ceiling and walls. It has indented arches forming a long tunnel, maybe 20 or 24 meters. The floor was lightly frozen over some water, which I found when I sat down. Christina is the person in charge of all the long running experiments, mostly in Terra Lab. She has been doing time-lapse studies of the environment. Last one was of the Gould leaving, in several thousand pictures. I suggested a picture of my ice sculpture melting and evaporating. In a land without green plants the rocks become stark, the lichens vivid. Especially as the snow melts off the glacier rubble, it exposes beauty in the patterns of lichens, moss and the rocks themselves. I have been in love with rocks for years, but here they are so prominent. In my proposal to the NSF I requested that I be allowed to cast the local rock if I decided that the it was more interesting than the ice. In the end, although I love the ice, the variety of textures is not all that great. After ten molds we had most of them. I asked and was granted persmission to spread the silicone mold material on sea-washed rocks next to the station. The resulting rubber mold is spectacular, although I didn't get to see it for long as it was snatched away to send home. Art has the incriminating photo of me spreading the raw goop on the rocks. I felt kind of bad doing it, even with permission since this environment is so pristine, the international park, as it were. But the silicone performed like a champ and completely peeled off the rock without a trace. I spent a few minutes picking up the few pieces, but there is no remaining evidence that anyting happened there, to my relief. I had visions of spending the last two days of my stay at Palmer Station rubbing moling compound off the rocks. Fortunately that was not the case. No post of mine from Antarctica would be complete without pictures of ice. We got the boat out and found some gorgeous pieces in Arthur Harbor. This piece was clear ice, but even underwater, you can see the facets, veils and bubbles. One last blue ice glacier bit. Two minutes of glorious sunset on the night before solstice at midnight. Orange light on the blue ice. I figured out how to save the glacier! I'm going to turn it into glass. I actually managed to make a small glass sculpture in the Palmer Station lab using exactly the process I had proposed with the ice molds. Over the past few weeks, Art and I have taken several silicone molds off of ice surfaces from pieces we have found in the water around the station. I melted some paraffin wax into different silicone textures and built up a small wax model for the glass using three textures from the ice. After embedding the wax in a dental casting plaster, I melted out the wax in a small lab bench furnace at about 200ºC. Here is my studio on the mash and grind deck of Palmer Bio building. We put the kiln go outside so as not to smoke everyone our during the burnout process. I was worried that the weather might affect the firing temperature, but it didn't. Here is the mold with chunks of glass I had brought from Oakland, melting at nearly 800ºC. The glass is a very light copper/cobalt blue, with about a thousandth percent colorant, very light. Ken setting the temperature on the controller. This controller was not ideal since it wouldn't turn down slower than 1ºC per minute. I wanted the high temperature cooling to be less than half that so I babied it for several hours while it went through that critical phase. Here is the piece when I broke it out of the mold. Notice the two textures. One was the smooth faceted ice and the other side was the snowy, granular ice. The "nose" is a third slightly wrinkly texture. Zenobia and Kerry organized an art show in the bar at Palmer. I put in some of my ice pieces, including this tall one I have shown before in "Ice Studies." The top photo is after an hour out of the freezer container. The second, several hours later as the sun was setting. The ice broke up internally around the crystals, which had also formed the facets. The afternoon was warm enough so the ice started to melt. It lasted just about exactly 24 hours before it tumbled to the deck. I also put in one of the silicone molds. I wonder if anybody got it, but it represented an absence of form, absence of a sculpture, maybe the absence of the glacier. Several guys were fascinated by the silicone, since it's flexible and strong. Above is another picture of my glass casting taken in the declining light of the day at about 11PM. Below is another of our "Ice Studies," when we were in the container with the photo lights. This one used one blue light to accentuate the clear form.
My first impression of Front Row was so positive - this crazy mac thing has a remote control, and you can use it to browse your media stuff. That's AWESOME, I love it! But then I ran into difficulties - I had trouble importing files into iTunes. I imported Iron & Wine like 5 times before I figured it out - the files had damaged tags, so iTunes (Apple's media management software) couldn't recognize them. Ok, that's a pain. I stuck into a Windows program, rewrote the tags, and then it worked. And then I decided I wanted to watch movies over the network. This turned out to be a challenge. The answer was to connect to the network share, and to drop a symbolic link to the mac filesystem into the "Movies" folder, so that I could make Front Row browse to that share. But then the first time that the mac slept, it severed the connection to the remote volume. After lots of research, I've found no simple solution. Apparently you can write a script to automatically mount a volume when the computer wakes from sleep, and there may be pay software out there, but no thanks on both counts. My solution so far - since I was moving my media to external hard drives anyway, I just plug that sucker into the mac. No problem. So I run Front Row, browse to Movies movies volumes mybook tv ds9 and I can watch all the Rene Auberjonois I want. It works, though I wouldn't say it "just" works. Of course, I have another hard drive in the living room, connected to the nice stereo, and that drive has all my music. I can't listen to any of it through Front Row. Because that music isn't in the iTunes database, it doesn't exist as far as Front Row is concerned. And I'm not about to let iTunes get its hands on that folder. I don't want to force all my computers to use iTunes. I don't even know how I'd go about dealing with the fact that I have one archive of the music which must be accessible to several computers. It's a solution that just doesn't work for me. Maybe it's years of windows use, but I am very much accustomed to the model that my computer files are organized by a filesystem hierarchy, and programs must access that hierarchy to work. I hate synching, and the attendant requirement that I lose control over my filesystems and access to those filesystems. That's why my mp3 player is now just my Blackberry Curve. I plug it into my computer, browse the filesystem, see what's there. I can drag a new folder into it at any time and delete folders at will. I don't have to run any program other than explorer to do this. I don't need any special cables to charge it, either, because I just plug it into a usb port. It's such a simple solution. I love it to death. I'm sure iTunes could do something similar if I were using an iPod, but I'd have to add the music to the iTunes database and then figure out how to put a selection of music on the iPod. And that's assuming I didn't run into any Iron & Wine-style problems. And I'm thinking about all this because of that badly-named iPad. I'm sure some people will like it, but I don't get it. I feel like you're paying a premium for a crippled computer. Like the iPhone, it's designed to lock you into using Apple products and Apple stores to get all your content, and I don't want that. For less than half the price of the iPad, I could have a netbook that would offer a real keyboard, the ability to run a much larger selection of applications, similar battery life, similar or better portability (having seen how many broken iPhone screens there are out there, I wonder how that big glass is going to fare), and a higher-resolution display. Mostly, it looks like a media player to me, and it lacks an HD display. It's a big glass box that you throw in your backpack and sometimes you surf the web on it. And maybe it's goofy to turn a netbook on its side to read comics, but I've done it and it works really, really well. But the best part is that I don't have to pay one company every time I want to do something on my netbook. I bought the damn computer, and it will do what I want it to with the music and movies that I already have. Also, my netbook cost me less than half what the iPad will cost. I don't get it. I love this Badly Drawn Boy song - the chorus starts "Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me". Perfect for these grey days. Another favorite "sun" song of mine is David Bowie's Memory of a Free Festival, here presented in appropriately "ragged and naive" cover form by a band of British optometry students: As the students explain in the video, the band makes heavy use of an institutional VCS3 synthesizer, made by EMS. EMS, oddly enough, advertised its synthesizers with nun imagery . The synthesizers sound - thick and analog - used on early Doctor Who. The effect - satori must be something quite the same. plus blocked fire hydrant plus fire truck equals hypocrisy comedy gold . A Metafilter thread about a video mocking The Dark Knight's plot holes yields this interesting comment by user rokusan: [...] the screenplay had a lot of buzz [....] because the structure was unexpectedly tight (despite the running time) and it was even darker than expected. I do remember, too, that it was presented to me as "it's about relentlessness." [....] The War on Terror buzz was because at the time, it was seen in some circles as unusually brave/crazy to attack or mock the USA's illegal surveillance apparatus: the movie shoved the wrongness of it at the audience by having one of America's Most Trusted Voices™ tell us how wrong it was. Big Budget Hollywood hadn't taken an anti-government stance much in recent times. This was unusual, and I think a lot of folks anticipating a "comic book" story didn't expect it. [....] I continue to be really surprised at the love for this movie (currently #9 on IMDB's top 250). I am doubly surprised at the excitement over the tightness of the thing - I thought it made no sense at all, like it's plot went through the blender. Scenes just come and go. Most famously - what happened at the end of the joker's home invasion? The scene ends with no resolution. I like Heath Ledger in TDK, but that's about it. Good Metafilter discussion about whether you should default on your home loan when the value of the home is way below the mortgage amount. Homes are immensely personal, and the discussion highlights the extent to which personal fondness for homes and senses of morality unite to cause people to make irrational decisions about their houses. There's a sad tale in there of a guy whose dad refused to go into bankruptcy out of a sense of honor, and the negative impact it had on his family.
Sorry, kiddos, but this blog has gone the way of the dodo. We've moved the blog over to our home site at ComicFoundry.com . So click over, continue reading and update your RSS feeds. Cya there Hey all! Changes are a coming for this site. Namely that it will be defunct quite shortly as we've relaunched ComicFoundry.com . Say goodbye to the users and portfolios — as much I loved having them as part of the original site it's not really what Comic Foundry is about any more. So say hello to a streamlined site with our integrated blog, story archive and issue excerpts. You can also now buy issues of the magazine and subscriptions through the site! So head on over to the new site , update your links and update your RSS feeds. See you there! (From a story on DIY costumes in the October issue of Complex) You're all probably excited about seeing Battlestar Galactica: Razor, right? I can't wait to see a TV movie about the Pegasus crew that debuts on Nov. 24th. Really, I can't wait. That's why I was so glad that registration on this site just opened for advance screenings in select cities on Nov. 12th! The lucky cities include: • Boston • Chicago • Dallas/ Ft. Worth • Los Angeles • New York City • Philadelphia • San Francisco • Seattle Hurry and register before they're out of fraking seats. Mark Millar just posted that he got turned down for writing the Superman movie sequel because he was too associated with Marvel: Well, sadly, I'm a Marvel guy and we were surprised to find out that WB couldn't hire me for a DC property. They were incredibly nice and superbly apologetic about it, but when they discussed the matter seriously DC explained just how associated I am with Marvel Comics at the moment and it's against company policy to hire the competition. It's absolutely nothing personal. I spoke to some friends at DC and they explained this has happened with a couple of big Marvel writers in the last couple of years and I absolutely respect that. My question is: How is that different when super-DC guy Geoff Johns wrote and produced for the Blade TV series (a Marvel property)?

Welcome to Grade 1: "Alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?"&nbsp; "They look like dolphins !"&nbsp; " Whales , like whales!"&nbsp; "Yeah FISH !!!"&nbsp; "SHAAARKS!"&nbsp; "Ooo ooo, Mr. Bond , oooo???!" "Yes, Billy?" " Miga !&nbsp; They look like Miga !"&nbsp; "YEAH!!! MIGA !!!"&nbsp; " MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA !!!!" "Settle down CHILDREN! CHILDREN! Ugh..." Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved 's next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ridden one? 7)&nbsp; Isn't there an easier way to spell "ichthyosaur?"&nbsp; Maybe with less h's? I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; Speak up!&nbsp; We won't bite! ...much! And to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working, watch this They Might Be Giants " Nine Bowls of Soup ," staring Mr. Ichthyosaur... Some fantastically modern artwork from 1959. Use the contents drop-down menu to go the the “Where Evolution Stands Today” article. Check out the ads along the way. I adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah, feel nostalgic. Note: cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool. &nbsp; When I say "Therapod" what pops into your mind?&nbsp; A sharp-toothed, fleet-footed, flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur, right?&nbsp; Tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs, raptors... But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; To participate in this and future Time Capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; It's not too late to join in the fun!

Therizinosaurus: a creature from Jim Henson's The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a 'shape' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition. The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what I went with. My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period, China ) , using only pencil and paper.

I wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. Hopefully the Alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months. It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today . It's obviously missing a head. I've gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head. (I also haven't had time to work on it.) I am extremely happy with the rest of it. It came out perfect. It just needs a good head. &nbsp; We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs!&nbsp; Great job, everyone!&nbsp; The new poll is up on the right sidebar, so be sure to vote for July's Time Capsule ( wouldn't you just LOVE to draw ferns?! Erm... ) As for the next Gallery, the winner of that poll is ... ICHTHYOSAURS ! So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp; To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery, send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved@gmail.com . We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It's hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a "blog of note" on Google's official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates. We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork, wrote posts, or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start. Of course it doesn't end here. Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved! Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too. The new comers include: Rachael's lino print here Craig and Peter finally launch the first tandem Live Blog. Craig's efforts here . Peter's here . Zach's Therizinosaur has begun here . Sarah begins work on her Therizinosaur here . You can also still check out the previous efforts of: Tricia now has her "evolution" of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia's Obligatory Art Blog !!! Anthony live-blogged his Therizinosaur on Anthony Contoleon ’s Posterous ! It is still not too late to live blog, or more to the point have your live blogging effort advertised here! If you are planning on live blogging just let us know where (your site or blog that the updates will be appearing on) and when (with the date and rough time zone). You can either tell us in the comment section of this post or send us an email to artevolved@gmail.com . Till then happy live blogging! Just saw this and had to pass it on.

Another view of the Maluti Mountains from Three Fountains in the Free State. For more super sky pictures go to the Skywatch site. Sunrise over the Maluti Mountains in Lesotho taken from the Three Fountains View in the Free State. Go to Skywatch for many more great pictures from around the world. These huts&nbsp;silhouetted against the sunset&nbsp;give an interesting view of a&nbsp;village&nbsp;in Lesotho. Go to the Skywatch site for more great&nbsp;photos from around the world. Make mine a dubble or should I say dubbel or is it double.......? I guess it doesn't matters. A specialist in court cases too? I think I may stand a better chance with my with my lawyer. . "Froggy, froggy may we cross your golden river?" "No!" "Why don't you rather stop for a while and admire my beauty?"&nbsp; It's amazing what you can find lurking beside the river banks. You can see the big picture or if you look more closely, you&nbsp;may see the little one as well. I came across this little fellow alongside a river in Lesotho and&nbsp;identified him as an Ornate frog (Hildebrandtia ornata). If you are interested in knowing more about these frogs click here . This is the second of my donkey sunsets taken in Lesotho. Come and enjoy the worldwide skywatch experience at the SkyWatc h site. This bald ibis vey obligingly posed for me the other day in Lesotho. I found this sign on a roadside shop&nbsp;in Lesotho quite amusing. I know what chips are, but can only guess what fats are..........needless to say that with my no fat and low cholesterol diet I was not tempted. Aside from the humour, it also shows an entrepreneurial spirit in a harsh environment, where there is a daily struggle to earn a living. This seemed like a desparate, or should I say novel,&nbsp;appeal for business in Molteno.&nbsp;I also see that some of the petals on the flower were sacrificed, to improve the view of the sign. Having just eaten a big breakfast at Aliwal North we did not stop. Then about 50 kilometres from Cradock we stopped at the Daggaboer Farm Stall to browse. For the unenlightened "dagga" is "marijuana" and "boer" is "farmer". Yes, that is the name of the farm. Apparently the name has four possible origins, but only one relates to dagga. If you want&nbsp;to hear these accounts you will have to pop into the&nbsp;farm stall and ask the owner. &nbsp;It is well worth a visit and I can highly recommend the homemade pineapple juice and ginger beer and the roosterbrood (griddle bread) And then, before resuming the journey, you can always stop in at the local loo, to have an "enjoyable farm pee".&nbsp;There is a lot of humour at the Daggaboer Farm Stall. You can also visit them on the net. At one time our travel was aimed at getting from point A to point B as quicly as possible. These days we kind of dawdle along and emjoy the ride, looking for the these types of roadside gems.
think I did with them, they are:1) Michael Ian Black, which appears in this week's issue of Time Out New York.2) Scott Weiland, which appears in the December issue of Spin magazine (which also contains an excellent article about Echo and the Bunnymen):3) Emile Hirsch, which I banished to the Time Out New York website because he didn't give me enough stuff to work with.AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, Chasing Ghosts, the documentary in which I am used for comic effect, is airing on Showtime all month.WHY I'M ANGRY TODAYIt's colder than 1,000 Antarcticas outside! Until ten minutes ago, I had completely forgotten that this existed. And when I did remember, I thought it had aired on Fridays, ABC's late-night comedy sketch show (costarring Larry David and Michael Richards). Instead, it was the Lorne Michaels-produced The New Show, which only lasted six episodes in 1984. When it aired, I thought this sketch was the funniest thing in the world. Wow.See more funny videos at Funny or DieWHY I'M ANGRY TODAYWhere my muffin at!? Speaking of Wayne Coyne, the interview was for an upcoming issue of Spin magazine to promote Christmas on Mars, his insanely wacky -- and just plain insane -- debut as a movie director. If you've ever wanted to see Fred Armisen plaintively singing "Silent Night" just minutes after a marching band whose members all have vaginas for heads walk over a baby and crush it to death, then by all means go see this movie.And speaking of Spin, its editors have graciously allowed me
Photos Of Borneo ----------- The Borneo Project (Donate!) Borneo - for most, perhaps, the name brings up nothing more than impressions of a vague, far-away and exotic place; others might associate it with headhunting tribes or wild orangutans. For myself, I had memories of intriguing silhouettes on the horizon - massive jungle-clad spires rising from azure seas, cloaked in mist . Passing the island in transit from the Solomon Islands to Bali aboard a tall ship in my late teens, I resolved to return to Borneo. In researching more about this fascinating place, I learned more of it's history and natural wonders. The world's oldest rain forest, rapidly being destroyed; incomparable scuba diving and snorkeling; local peoples whose traditions still could be experienced first-hand, yet are rapidly changing; and the chance to see rare wildlife such as the Orang-Utan . Lately, too, I had read much about the impact of palm plantations on the destruction of rain forest in this part of the world. In the media, this destruction has been linked to the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry - calling into question the very notion that biofuels will help our societies transition to a more environmentally responsible future. As an advocate of a sustainable biodiesel, I wanted to see and understand the impacts first-hand. A few weeks before the winter holidays, my wife and I discussed possible vacation destinations. At one point we asked each other where it was that we most wanted to travel to, regardless of the practicality. Borneo came to mind, and on a lark almost, we looked into airfares and cost. Surprisingly, we found that if we flew on Christmas day, we could get a really good airfare. So, with only 10 or 12 days to go, we booked our flights and feverishly prepared to fly halfway around the world. What we found was perhaps one of the most active frontiers between wilderness and traditional cultures, and the modern industrial world. As with so much of this tension, much of this revolves around questions of energy, so I wanted to write a bit in my blog about what we observed. First, allow me to situate Borneo in some context. Borneo is the third largest island in the world, larger than Texas, and is shared (not always peacefully) but Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. We visited the Malaysian part of Borneo, consisting of the states of Sabah and Sarawak, running across the northwestern portion of the island; with the exception of the Sultanate of Brunei, which is a small and wealthy pocket between the two states. The interior of Borneo is the very definition of rugged. Never having been glaciated, the landforms are quite dramatic . The rain forest is home to many dangerous animals and even plants - including a tree who's sap can kill a man in minutes if it so much as touches a small open wound. Just moving through the forest is exhausting - even on a trail. The thin soil barely covers the uneven and razor-sharp limestone geology. Even on flat ground the pockmarked terrain conspires with thick tree roots that criss-cross the ground to create a forest floor seemingly designed to trip and twist the ankle of the unwary . The lowlands are largely submerged in a foot or two of tea-colored swamp, and are home to several different flavors of leech which inevitably attach themselves to inconvenient areas of the body. Massive walls of limestone rise at a punishing angles from the lowlands, creating ridgelines that are extremely difficult to traverse. A jungle trek in Borneo, even today, is an adventure . This kept colonizers - first Indian Rajahs, then the English "white Rajas" - marginalized in their real control of the territory to the coasts. Many of the indigenous Dayak peoples that live in Borneo only had regular contact with the outside world (primarily missionaries) starting in the 50's. Headhunting was a regular activity of these peoples up until World War Two at least, with many invading Japanese soldiers losing their heads to traditional, barefooted warriors armed only with machetes and blowpipes (and it should be noted, many groups were systematically slaughtered by the Japanese in retribution). We met elders who had fought and taken heads as young men, and had the tattoos to prove it. Because Borneo is so rugged, until recently all travel was on the river systems (river travel is still by far the easiest way to get around) and almost all of the peoples lived their lives on the rivers and forests immediately adjacent. As could be expected, the rain forest is a rather inhospitable place for outsiders wishing to exploit the resources. In contrast, for the indigenous peoples, the forest is their traditional supermarket, pharmacy, hardware store and lumber yard. Our guide, of Iban extraction, showed us dozens of unremarkable looking plants just off the trail, each of which had numerous uses. The semi-nomadic Dayak have lived in these forests for many centuries (at least) and their traditional culture is exquisitely intertwined with it. Our guide lives in an apartment, spends a lot of time of his cell phone, promptly answers his email, and flies between cities to meet his clients. Yet, as a youth, he learned to make fifty different kinds of traps and to hunt with a blowpipe. He estimates that he could survive for at least a month in jungle if he was dropped into it with nothing but the clothes on this back. Nonetheless, exploitation of the forests has proceeded apace since the 1960's or so; beginning with logging of tropical hardwoods. The lowlands have been drained to allow access for bulldozers, lumber trucks and a massive amount of inexpensive labor (largely Indonesian workers). A lot of this logging is now on the third or fourth pass over the more accessible areas, with smaller and smaller trees being taken out. Now that the economically extractable timber is dwindling, much land is being cleared outright, primarily for palm oil plantations. These plantations form the backbone of a tropical oleo-economy that may be as economically and ecologically significant as the corn and soy agricultural economy of North America. Those of you that follow the debates over biofuels are no doubt familiar with palm oil. This crop produces very high yields of oil from its fruits. It is farmed as a monoculture, with oil extracted using industrial-scale processes to yield a wide variety of products ranging from edible oils to chemical feedstocks. What most people seem unaware of, with all the hand-wringing about biofuels is that even without the influence of biodiesel, the spread of oil palm plantations seems inevitable. Palm oil is a crucial source of cheap calories throughout the tropical developing world. Almost all fried food in Southeast Asia and India is cooked in palm oil, and proprietors of roadside stands and small restaurants thrive or fail by the market price of this commodity. The Malaysian Palm Oil Council indicates that 90% of palm oil is consumed as food, with the remaining portion used in non-food applications (including biodiesel). This is worth repeating - at present, less than 10% of the palm oil produced globally is used to make biodiesel. The vast majority is consumed. While we were in Borneo, Malaysia was in a several day uproar over a rumor of palm oil rationing; of course, Malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil, but the export market had apparently squeezed domestic supply. Palm oil derived chemicals are found in many every day products like shampoo, cosmetics, and processed foods. Palm oil has even been proposed as (irony alert) an "environmentally sensitive" drilling fluid for deep-sea petroleum exploration . However, that said, the demand for high-yield oil crops to serve biodiesel demand - predominately from Europe - has lead to something of a gold rush mentality among palm oil plantation owners, who are enthusiastically clearing land in preparation for exponentially increasing demand; it takes nearly 3 years from the time a plantation is put in until the point the palms bear the oil-rich fruit. The increasing demand for palm oil and lag time until the plantations bear inevitably leads to boom and bust cycles. The current high price of palm oil fuels two contentious debates with regards to bio-based energy - global warming impact (from forest clearing) and the food vs. fuel controversy . Recently, the European Union proposed a sustainability certification scheme that would preclude the use of most palm-oil based biodiesel. This seems prudent and wise, but to date, is only a proposal. So now to the situation on the ground, by air. As I noted, until recently, the only practical way to get around Borneo was by river. However, this is no longer the case. Malaysian Borneo is now served by an excellent and affordable network of airlines, mostly flying Airbus A300's on longer routes to the bigger airports, and twin-engine turboprops (Twin Otters and Fokker 50's) to the smaller destinations. Our experience with air travel in Malaysia is that it matches or exceeds one's experience in the US, both in terms of cost and comfort. It is also an excellent opportunity to see the lay of the land. In many places, what you observe is oil palm plantations as far as the eye can see. The vastness of this is hard to overstate. One can see huge areas cleared to bare soil , with neat grids of access roads, ready to to be planted; and similarly, undulating rows of palms in various states of maturity, often surrounding isolated islands of jungle atop inaccessible spires. On the ground, the experience is repeated. Driving from the airport in Tawau to the dive spot gateway of Semporna, about an hour away, one sees virtually nothing but these plantations . It is a sobering experience to think of the biodiversity that has been annihilated by these massive developments. It is also difficult to overstate the impact on the Dayak both by the plantations and the logging. Many Dayak have moved to the cities and live very modern lives, and especially some Iban groups do enjoy political power and influence. Thus, there are certainly some cases where the indigenous groups have benefited economically - at least in the short term - by these activities. By and large, however, the lions share of the economic benefit has gone directly to the largely Chinese companies which run the logging operations and plantations, and indirectly to the mainland Malay who enable this exploitation from a political perspective. Most of the labor, as mentioned, is imported from Indonesia. We visited a longhouse as part of a backpacking trip in Mulu park. This longhouse is a traditional structure where an entire village lives under one roof. In practice, this is essentially an enormous low-rise apartment building with a large common veranda in front. The people of this longhouse still make much of their livelihood from the forest. The tourists that visit come to see the protected areas of the national park that abut these communities, even while some of the same people involved in the tourism trade illegally hunt wild boar inside the park boundaries (as they have for hundreds of years). One of the main cash trade activities is gathering wild fruit, particularly durian, from the jungle; as wild-harvested durian is considered to be the best of this sought-after delicacy and commands a high price in urban markets . The people who live in the longhouses still look to the forest, in short, for food, medicine, and building materials. Thus, many logging concessions have met with significant protest by the indigeous people, including road blockades met with government violence . We spoke to one park guide who had been active in such a movement in his home village, who had been imprisoned and beaten. In turn, he and his compatriots fashioned handcuffs from sharp-edged jungle leaves and built a jail with walls of poisonous thorns, and informed the police that unauthorized incursions on their territory from them or any loggers would be similarly met with imprisonment. In the end, such confrontation is only a delaying tactic, and this guide recognized that the only way to preserve the forest, is for the forest to produce economic activity for his village. Otherwise, there is temptation to fall prey to divide-and-conquer tactics on the part of the logging companies like substantial payoffs to prominent individuals to allow logging and plantations. While one solution is official government protection of the lands, Malaysia has at times resorted to fairly heavy-handed tactics in the establishment of these national parks. For instance, on the outskirts of Mulu park there is a Penan "settlement" where the primary activity is sales of handicrafts (trinkets really) to tourists. The Penan are not there by choice. As a semi-nomadic people with a hunter-gatherer culture that has changed little since the Stone Age, they were judged by the government to not be compatible with the establishment of a national park and were enticed (or forced) from their traditional lands about 15 years ago. They were told to choose between being Muslim or Christian, the government built homes, a church (they chose Christian mostly because being Muslim would preclude them from hunting forest game), and a school and have tried to teach them to practice agriculture. They were the most economically and culturally depressed people that we met in Borneo. Without a doubt, this sort of thing has lead to undeniable ethnic tensions in Borneo. Malaysia advertises and prides itself on being a multi-ethnic and harmonious state, but in practice relations seem strained at best. We met a ethnic Chinese taxi driver who told us not to trust any ethic Malays (as we would be ripped off); Malays who were horrified that we would hire an ethnic Chinese taxi driver (as we would be ripped off); and indigenous people who had no love lost for either group, or migrant Indonesian workers, and were deeply concerned about ethnic tensions and resource exploitation exploding into outright sectarian violence (as has occurred periodically in Indonesia). The ironic thing of course is that we were treated fantastically by everyone we met of every ethnicity; although of course, as Americans traveling in a majority-Muslim country, we were often offered direct opinions and confrontational questions about our government's foreign policies. Even as the indigenous people fight to preserve and to have access to their traditional lands, it should be recognized that the tide of modernization is not, on the whole, leaving them behind. It was no coincidence that at the longhouse, we saw few men of working age; mostly old people, children, and some young women with families. One of the activities we participated in the longhouse was a presentation and participation in traditional music and dancing . During this, one of the few young indigenous men around was taking pictures of the dancing with his digital camera - he was clearly home on a break. We met a large number of youngsters that spoke flawless English and were getting ready for their big exams to get into secondary school and then, they hoped, into university. The interior of the apartments we saw were heavy with photos of graduates in caps and gowns; the resident's children and grandchildren. The longhouse itself - though poor by first world standards - had electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigeration , and satellite TV in many apartments. The level of material wealth present - compared, for instance, to rural Africa - was very high. That Malaysia - even in these outlying areas - is not a poor country comes back to the theme of this blog once again. The petroleum industry in Malaysia is the engine. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpar are one of the most impressive man-made sights I have ever seen in my life. These edifices were not built on palm oil profits, obviously. Malaysia's "asian tiger" status is largely a function of oil wealth. Their policies are leading to significant investment in education for its citizens, and economic diversification (towards the semiconductor industry for instance) which is wise. However, there is a clear sense of striving towards ever increasing material wealth that is already dramatically impacting the preservation of cultural diversity, as Malaysians of all ethnicities embrace a homogenized cultural mieleu
 seemingly centered on American pop music, Japanese fashion, and the most impressive shopping malls one could imagine. It seemed to me that perhaps the most popular recreational activity for young Malaysians of any ethnicity is to spend the day packed like sardines into a "cybercafe" where they play games (Counterstrike, Grand Theft Auto, and World of Warcraft seemed popular), IM, and watch YouTube. At about $1 per hour to enjoy air-con, entertainment, and socializing it is indeed a good value. It is, frankly, an open question whether the rain forest of Borneo can be meaningfully preserved in the face of this dynamic. Hand in hand with this, preservation of traditional cultural knowledge is in question; of course, the Dayak of Borneo have and will continue to adapt their cultural response to circumstances. It is likely, as in other circumstances, that the young Dayak will realize that their cultural heritage is fading and will work to reconstitute their traditions and identities. Still, inevitably much will be lost - especially if the forest is destroyed. Again, from the perspective of this blog, the question is whether renewable energy is working as a constructive and destructive force. For the Dayak that have installed micro-hydro run of river systems and now enjoy electrification, this serves to strengthen their local economy and this in turn helps them preserve the forest. Conversely, if the West sources it's biofuel feedstock from palm oil, Borneo's transformation may be irreversible and complete. In this case, the fate of the Dayak may follow that of other indigenous groups who's values, lifestyle, and location are not compatible with massive resource exploitation. Let us hope that this does not come to pass. As a closing note, I can recommend The Borneo Project as a group that is doing great to help the various groups in Borneo achieve sustainable economic activity and thereby preserve the rain forest. Please donate (link at top). Yesterday, the Berkeley City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that will finance PV systems and energy efficiency improvements for homeowners in the city. Though the plan was announced last week, I haven't had a chance to blog so this is as good a time as ever to write a few words about it. When I first heard of this, it struck me as one of those "only in Berkeley" type things and rubbed my libertarian streak the wrong way, leading to ornery thoughts. It's been a long time coming, right? How come the private sector can't get it together to provide financing for residential PV? It has always seemed like a fantastic opportunity for an entrepreneurial approach, so it seems like Berkeley is competing directly with private enterprise here. But can you usurp private enterprise, if the service isn't really being offered by the private sector? I guess not. I've come around. The way this is structured is actually brilliant and everyone wins. So in a nutshell, the deal is that the City pays the upfront cost for the installed system. Then, an assessment is added to the property tax, and through this assessment, the homeowner pays the City back with interest over 20 years. So here are the main points: First, (assuming the system is sized properly) the assessment is less than the utility savings, so it is cash-flow positive for the homeowner; and of course after 20 years, it's free power. Second, the system and the assessment belong to the property, not to the homeowner. This is critical. It means that value of the system will be properly appraised as part of the property, so there is no risk of losing the value of the system upon sale of the house. Moreover, whether an owner stays in the house for 1 year or 30 years, they still see all upside. Third, the City is raising the money with a municipal bond; the lowest interest rate anywhere; passing this through to the homeowner helps make the economics compelling. Fourth, the City gets a guaranteed revenue stream. The biggest issue that I see is that demand in Berkeley is going to utterly explode. I have a hard time imagining that nearly every homeowner in Berkeley who gets wind of this won't try to sign up. I don't know how any of the local installers will keep up, in the short term at least. This sounds like a nice problem to have, but of course the concern is that there could be a proliferation of naive, and in all probability (like in any "gold rush") some opportunistic new installers and service providers doing this work -- and doing a bad job. Of course most new entrants will be honest and competent, but it's the inevitable bad apples that worry me. Balancing exceptional industry growth and the need for installers to support that growth are the realities that properly installing 30-year service life equipment is not easy, there is a rather complex set of reliability, safety, and regulatory / rebate issues to grapple with, and customers who may not have realistic expectations due to relentless solar hype are not necessarily the easiest to please. The other substantive concern I have is if the contract with the City (and thus the assessment) includes periodic inverter replacements, or whether the homeowner is on the hook for it on their own. Modules are typically guaranteed to product at least 80% of their rated power after 25 years, but most inverters carry a 10 year warranty. This means it is very likely that at least one inverter replacement at the owner's cost over the system lifetime, and possibly two, will be required. At a couple thousand bucks a pop (depending on size) this has implications for system economics. An honest and professional assessment of system economics should assume these maintenance costs as well as the slow degradation in power output. The inverter issue is quite problematic if a new owner moves in just before the inverter fails out of warranty, and then has to either shell out cash for the equipment, pay the assessment even though they are getting no benefit, or try to get the property assessment canceled (in which case the city is left holding the bag). The city says it will roll out the plan in about 8 months, so hopefully will have the foresight to address this issue. All that said, assuming this doesn't get bungled up in red tape or political shenanigans -- and there's never a guarantee there, especially in B-town -- it seems inevitable that this idea will spread quickly. One of the most interesting aspects of solar these days is the leadership of the states in successfully setting de facto national energy policy in the current leadership vacuum at the Federal level. It appears that Berkeley has taken this one step further. Potentially, this initiative could serve as a seed crystal for a concept that could radically impact the way we produce electricity, nationally, even internationally - one town at a time. There is an excellent article on biofuels in the October National Geographic . It does the best job I've seen in any mainstream publication - perhaps in any publication - of elucidating the importance of feedstocks to the sustainability and ultimately feasibility of biofuels. The article touches on both ethanol and biodiesel. With ethanol, the article focuses on corn, sugarcane (and the Brazilian experience), and celluosic feedstocks and the tradeoffs of each. For biodiesel, soy is discussed but algae also gets significant attention, including a rare behind-the-fence photo at the Greenfuels plant in Arizona. I highly recommend picking it up for a read. It also includes a fascinating article about modern pirates in Southeast Asia. So you really can't go wrong. In other news, Solar Power 2007 was great last week. It was fun to see old friends and colleagues and there was a fantastic sense of momentum. My presentation on innovation drivers for balance of system components seemed a success, with some good questions, so that was very satisfying. I only made a couple of the other talks, the CEO forum and the closing plenary. The forum was quite interesting, with some good questions and it seemed, frank answers. Main fact - national SEIA had a lobbying budget of just $20,000 last year and the goal this year is just $60,000. This was to me, just astonishing given the amount of money spent in Washington by the mainstream energy industry. The highlight of the closing plenary was a tour-de-force presentation by the senior energy manager of Wal-Mart . I was not aware that they are far ahead of the pack in terms of energy efficiency in their stores, though of course I had heard of the solar roll-out. Apparently this is just a pilot and if successful, Wal-Mart has a policy and track record of rolling out energy innovations massively. That is truly exciting stuff. I've been thinking about this next post for a bit now. I haven't had time to write anything lately but hopefully, I'll be able to post somewhat consistently over the next few months. What's on my mind is giving some advice to the those that seek a job in the solar industry. There are lots of opportunities out there for the right people, and it's a good time to get your foot in the door. At the same time, as has been noted before, the hype machine is in overdrive. So buyer beware, especially if your livelihood is riding on it. So let me first start with a cautionary tale. On Friday, the entire board of directors and CEO of Automatic Tooling Systems (ATS) , the Canadian company that owned Spheral Solar (and conventional module manufacturer PhotoWatt ), resigned in the face of "dissident hedge fund" shareholders demanding a turnaround . ATS's foray into renewable energy (as well as auto industry woes) was blamed for this sory state of affairs. Spheral Solar was actually shut down earier this year and ATS tried to spin off PhotoWatt in an IPO in late March, but failed . Previously, Spheral was touted as the best thing since sliced bread, an amazing technology that allowed them to make flexible modules, with significantly less silicon, that (in theory at least) boasted near crystalline PV efficiency. Four years ago, the "New Scientist" wrote this breathless article about " 'demin' solar panels to clothe future buildings"; and Future Pundit wrote that Spheral would "start production in 2004" Yet as late as January 2006 the " Clean Break " blog opined, referring to a deal between building products manufacturer Elk (recently acquired by GAF) and Spheral to make building-integrated roofing materials with the technlogy, that "the product is sold before it's even been produced. Now that's the kind of certainty that investors like" . Well, maybe so, but of course that only works out if the company manages to manufacture their technology on a commercial scale. If you've been following the solar industry for any length of time, you come to realize that announcements from a company of the intent to produce, or the ability to produce, or even signed contracts to manufacture and install their technologies means very little if they don't have a track record of doing so (especially if they announced, and then failed, to go into production two years prior). The point of this cautionary tale is that there are a lot of solar companies out there these days, and there are all sots of announcements and blog posts and what-have-you that make them look like just the greatest new thing. Be skeptical, and be smart, because in the next 5 years or so I think we're going to see a significant shake-out occur in this business. If you are looking for a job, gut-check the risk level you are willing to take. If there are only a few employees, promises of lots of options, some venture funding and a prototype out in a garage - well, that's a high risk situation. Potentially high reward if it actually does work out of course. But a day of reckoning will come for all start-ups, especially if VC funded. There are a number of well known, seemingly reputable companies that have been around for years now and have yet to set up even modest manufacturing capacity or field a market-ready (i.e. all required certifications) product. There's even one which shall remain unnamed, based in Silicon Valley, which is infamous for being extraordinarily well funded - yet no one I've spoken to has even seen a prototype of their breakthrough technology. That's all well and good for a while but after several years have passed, one must begin to wonder. Conversely, there are more established players with a reputation, products, vision, and great growth potential; but less speculative upside. Look at the bigger pattern, the fundamentals, if you will. There's nothing new under the sun (ahem). Thin film was the the Next Big Thing five or six years ago, unfortunately, there were some serious reliability issues and so much for that. Now it's back in vogue. Not coincidentally, this new generation of thin film technologies (most of which is not yet commercialized) arose simultaneously with a rather prolonged shortage of polysilicon, the raw material of relatively high-efficiency crystalline solar cells. Same with concentrating photovoltaics, which saw a lot of effort in the '80s and up until the mid '90s, then largely abandoned as the price of 1-sun cells came down; but resurged with poly shortage driving silicon prices up. The high prices made thin film and CPV look good - trading significantly less silicon usage for low efficiency and mechanical / optical complexity, respectively. So now it's two or three years later. Some of these new innovators have already fallen by the wayside, others are still working towards commercialization, and one German thin film company made it past the finish line in time and is raking it in (and good for them!). But it seems that in the opinion of most analysts, the poly situation is already relaxing as many new plants come online. The question is, will these thin film and CPV solutions still be attractive in a world that is not silicon-constrained? In a world where the PV market is being flooded by low-cost, mid-efficiency crystalline PV technology from China while a few of the more technologically positioned crystalline PV players duke it out for high-efficiency dominance, and where vertical integration appears to bring some distinct advantages? Finally factor in that solar thermal powerplant technology (like the SEGS plants or, for a less proven example, Stirling dishes) looks pretty attractive for the really big centralized solar power plant market. In other words, who's going to win? It's a tough one but that's a question I would recommend answering to your own satisfaction before choosing to sign on the dotted line. Now the foregoing was perhaps more focused on the tech-type jobs but there are other opportunities out there. For instance, there are any number of installation companies out there ranging from Mom and Pops to installers that are becoming regional or even national players, catering to the residential retrofit and commercial markets. It's physical, outdoor construction work. If you have the right skill-set it's a good job and you're bound to learn something about solar. But still, do your homework, understand their business plan, and understand how the job might change if your employer goes public or gets acquired - and don't be shy about asking a potential employer about, specifically, what's in it for you in one of these cases. So - the best of luck to all those interested in getting a job in this space. If you are serious, I can definitely recommend showing up at Solar Power 2007 in Long Beach (September 24-27) and getting your own impression of the industry. There's even a Career Center and a " Find Your Dream Job In Solar" seminar. TED global recently posted some extremely interesting talks from the June, 2007 conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Among the featured speakers was William Kamkwamba, the young man from Malawi who built a homemade wind turbine for his family (see previous post ). I highly recommend the videos; two in particular are extraordinarily powerful and captivating. Moreover, they are primarily focused on identifying and strengthing positive trends, which is a refreshing change from the litany of negativity often found when Africa is discuessed. George Ayittey , a Ghanan economist, takes no prisoners in his powerful indictment of the corruption of Africa's elites while la
I received a fun email yesterday from Lindsay, telling me about the "Co-Ed Bent Objects Birthday Party" she had.  She and her friends created some pretty good Bent Objects-like scenarios (I especially like the burrito one), and I'm flattered that she chose my work as the theme to her party and to have fun with.Also, I shared on my Twitter a while back a link to Szymon's Inspire Me Now blog. It was quite a hit.  Need some inspiration, or just feel like checking out other people's awesome work? You should go there. Right now.Speaking of being inspired by things on the web-I've been thinking a lot lately about how I believe that the web is speeding up creative's progressions.  Of course, it's speeding up learning and sharing in every field, from scientists being able to share findings with each other in real time, to people sharing info on Twitter to form instant political protests.  My particular interest is about creativity though.  No longer do artists have to wait to have a gallery showing to get a lot of feedback.  They can join an internet group and show others their work, and have discussions about it.  No more waiting on a certain book or even  a certain magazine to come out to see what the rest of the world is doing.  The give and take between people who create is now happening on a daily, hourly, and instant basis. I find this all kind of mind-blowing whenever I think about it.  If you love art, design, crafting, film, animation, etc, these are extremely exciting times

I saw your comments on the Dukes web site and your note on your blog. Jono was my first platoon commander in 1979. I recall that no matter how cold it was, or how windy or wet, he would always strip off to the waist and have a daily wash out of his mess tin with the tiniest flannel on this planet. This he would do in full view of his troops without a shiver, If ever I felt cold or miserable, just looking up to my platoon commander made me feel safe.&nbsp; He earned our trust in him, we would have followed him to hell he was such a leader.

Cf. this extract from an interview with Ken Robinson, an inspiring advocate of an education that does more to let people's creativity and other gifts develop: "...I don't mean to say that you have to have failed at school before you can be a success, but an awful lot of people who did well after school didn't do well in school. Paul McCartney went to school in Liverpool and, as you say, he went through the whole of his education there and nobody thought he had any musical talent. One of the other people in the same (...) music class was George Harrison, the lead guitarist of The Beatles, and he went through school as well and nobody noticed he had any talent. So (...)one teacher in Liverpool in the '50s had half The Beatles in his class and he missed it." Google "Ken Robinson TED" for more in the same vein.

Well, thanks for your blog, it's fabulous and I learn a lot with it. Bye, see you soon! =) January 22, 2010 Anonymous said...Dear Bill, to my mind it's really important to thank you, because it's a very fascinating thing to study the subject of WW1 with a real testimony like I can do with my school (I am on the French class who made an interview with you). Thank to share this with we. January 22, 2010 Marina said...Mister Lamin, To start, thank you for your interview. I think your project is very interesting not to forget the people who took part in World War 1 and not to forget their courage. Your project is admirable. Best regards from Marina. January 22, 2010 Marion said...I'm a student from "Lycée Lebrun" in Coutances (France). Last Friday, my class interviewed you. I want to thank you for your time, and congratulations on your blog, that is a good idea. January 22, 2010 Marion said...hello Mr Lamin !! Just a comment to tell you thanks for all. You can be proud of your project because your blog is really interesting and even if your grand-father was shy I'm sure he would be very happy to know his grandson doesn't forget his experience and contributes to inform about what happened. Bye and good luck for the future. January 22, 2010 Laura and Jeanne said...Hello M. Lamin. It's Laura and Jeanne , students of 1L2 in Lycée Lebrun in France. Thanks for having accepted and taking time for the interview of our class. Your blog is very interesting and unusual. We're happy to know that for your Grandparents it was a Happy end. We hope that the story of your grandfather is going to be used for a documentary. We wish you good luck for the future. Goodbye. January 22, 2010 Pauline said...Hello,Bill!! I'm a Lebrun High School student, I have studied your blog and your grandfather's letters. I appreciated very much the video conversation, it was very interesting for me. I hope your blog will carry on having a lot of success. Thank you very much !!!! January 22, 2010 Mimi said...Thank you for letting us share in Harry's life through the war. It was very moving to read his personal letters. February 25, 2010 Brett Hagan said...This is great man I personally think you should make this into a book it would be great!!!I would definately buy it fo sho!!! February 17, 2010 He hasn't heard! BL Sarah and Nick said...Wow, where to start. I began reading your blog after I read an article on CNN. I am currently deployed to Iraq and have been keeping a journal of my day to day activities...With email and SKYPE to keep connected to family there is no need to "write" home. The journal will help me pass my "memories" for my son and hopefully someday grandchildren to enjoy. I will be headed home in June to be with my family after a 6 month tour...I can't imagine what it would have been like for Harry after 16 months without leave. He is a true hero and I thank you for your dedication to his memory. May God bless you and your family. Sarah, Camp Victory, Iraq February 07, 2010 Anne said...Wonderful. I do hope Harry and family settled down well together. Must have been a bit of adjustment for all of them. Thank you so much for the blog. Look forward to reading all the ''loose ends'' too. Amersham. January 29, 2010 James said...I started following Harry in the summer of 2007. We had sheep and a smallholding, moved to Norway, had our son, have moved back to the UK. I've changed in that time. Nothing in comparison to how Harry and the world will have changed in the same time. I hope he manages/managaged to cope with the rest of his life. I'll be visiting the war graves at Nijmegen on my way home. Thanks for making me appreciate things more, realise how lucky I am January 28, 2010 vintage said...Thanks for taking the time to keep the blog going like you have. January 26, 2010 G.

January 27, 2010 Linda H-F said... Harry and Bill, Thank you. Both of you. And all your comrades - soldiers and teachers and just plain humans - who somehow help to make us all more human by sharing glimpses into your lives. I'm planning t
 donate some blood in your honor, Harry (I haven't much money, but perhaps that is more valuable....) and then make a trip to the San Francisco, California USA WWI veterans memorial and the Presidio cemetery.... as a thank you to both of you and all your contemporaries. Thank you, Bill, for helping this history to come alive, and to help us to share the journey with Harry and his mates all these months. This is what the passing on of History really ought to be.... My parish Church has a chalice donated at Christmas 1919 as a prayer that there will never again be another war of this magnitude.... and I will think of &amp; pray for you both whenever it is used...Gratefully, Linda H-F, San Francisco, CA January 24, 2010 Robin in Ohio said...Bill, Thanks for your hard work on this blog. I've enjoyed it very much and am pleased to hear that Harry arrived home safely. Please let us know more about Harry and his family. What happened after he returned from the war? Thanks, Robin in Ohio January 25, 2010 AG said... Just back from holiday to find that Harry is home at last; squealed with glee, though now I wonder what I'll do without his semi-regular letters! (I wonder if Ethel missed the letters sometimes too, and read them in odd moments? It can be so lovely to look back on such things after it's all ended happily, can't it.) Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for publishing these -- for giving your faithful readers a glass through which to look back on the sacrifices of the Great War, and for being such a faithful curator of these precious family documents. All the best to you and yours, and I'll raise a glass this evening in Harry's memory. January 24, 2010 Sgt Sam Avery said...Hello Harry: Glad to hear you're finally home. Long business getting back there, what? As for me, still in France and making my way to the coast at a snail pace. Stop by for a read when you can. Regards, Sam PS. Bill, I know how you must feel at the journey's end. I'm dreading it myself, except for the fact that my own book project is still in the works as a distraction from the emotion of it all being "over." Best of luck with the loose ends. Rich January 24, 2010 Dieter Finzen said...Bill, Thank you so much for doing this brilliant blog – besides providing great information about the individual perspective of war, your blog was THE inspiration for future “historical blogs” to come. Even though I have just started my own historical blog, I can tell how much effort you must have put into this unique project! All the best - you wrote internet history for sure! January 24, 2010 Marcy said...When I first started reading, very soon after you started posting, I was desperate to know if Harry made it home. I didn't want to go through weeks of letters to find out he died in 1917 or something. When I got the book and found he survived, I was so pleased! but I'm also glad that I went through the weeks of letters because it's been a fantastic experience. Harry wasn't famous, he didn't become a politician or campaigner, he was just one of many soldiers who endured an awful event. Despite his modest status, to me he really is a hero. Thank you Bill and thank you Harry. January 22, 2010 meg's mommy said...This was an amazing blog and I have so enjoyed following Harry's journey. Thank you so much for all you have done. It is much appreciated. January 21, 2010 Gerri Patrick said... Three cheers for Harry and three cheers for you, Bill. Thank you for sharing Harry's amazing story with us.

Please let us know what happened of him: I hope he had some rest finally January 20, 2010 Jason R said... An amazing journey. Yes, you could not have made up a better ending. I like how short and to the point it is. Thank you for posting this amazing project. Doing it in real-time was a wonderful idea. January 19, 2010 Pfc Benjamin Kaplow said... Please accept my gratitude for taking us on your journey to honor your grandfather. His letters about his WW1 experiences are now a part of history for all to read. Thank goodness you rescued them from that drawer where they were tucked away for so many years. A huge thank you for sharing them with so many of us throughout the world. I bet you never dreamt what your future would hold as you picked up that first letter from the drawer to read. So happy Harry is home safely. Thanks for the book, too. And to top it off, I can’t get Harry’s song out of my head. I imagine it will become background music for the audio book. Keep up the good work. My very best, Florence January 17, 2010 Elizabeth said...I cried! I am so glad that Harry is safely home at long last. What happened next? I want know more about the family!

Gratefulness you as your information. January 17, 2010 Todd said...I, like a lot of people checked to see if there was any new letters every morning before I went to work. My feelings are torn between happiness that Harry made it home safe and sadness that his story is over. I truly enjoyed following his story and will miss reading about his experiences. Thank You for sharing this part of your life and legacy. Todd NC, USA January 16, 2010 Simon said...Many thanks for the interview today. Really interesting experience. January 15, 2010 Simon is a member of a class of French children who are using Harry's blog to practice their English. We did a "live" interview on Skype when they used their English skills to question me about Harry and the blog. Very enjoyable. BL Gillian said... Thank you for publishing this blog. Now to buy the book! North Yorkshire, UK January 15, 2010 elhaf said...Hadn't checked in in a while, and now just in time I came back. Congrats to Harry for making it home at last. January 15, 2010 Jim said...Woo Hoo! Harry made it through. Having young kids myself I can't even begin to imagine what the release was like for him as he held his family for the first time. Bill, sincerely, thank you for your investment in time and humanity through this journey. Lest others forget... January 16, 2010 Tim Douglass said...Wow! I've been following Harry's story since about the second page so it is going to be a bit of a shock to the system to not have any new letters to look forward to. You are to be commended, Bill, for the way you have honored Harry and also all the others who fought for their countries in the great war. January 16, 2010 Anonymous said..."Say it ain't so." I began following the blog when I assigned it to a classroom of community college history students and while they are now long finished with the class, subsequent classes have also followed Harry's journey through World War I. I can remember how excited we were to find out that he survived the war--It has been a joy and pleasure to follow along. Thank you so much for all your hard work. January 15, 2010 Two Shorten the Road said...I've really enjoyed your blog, and will miss checking in with Harry's letters. January 15, 2010 Sheila said...I can imagine how excited Harry's family were to have him home. My earliest memory is of my father returning from World War 11. He just walked into the house. I am told that the telegram announcing his arrival was delivered the following day! Although the family knew he was on his way, they didn't know which day he would come. I wonder if Harry's family were in the same situation. I look forward to finding out what the future held for the Lamin family. January 15, 2010 dean said...Kathryn has made an excellent point...you have brought us into your family (metaphorically speaking)...we have all taken Harry on as kind of a "surrogate grandfather in the War"; so I think we all hope to get a very comprehensive follow-up as to how "Grandpa" made out, and how that led to the very astute and creative grandson we have also come to very fond of. Dean Roosevelt, Toronto January 15, 2010 Kathryn S said...Until I found this, I'd never really seen the point of blogs! This has been brilliant and I'll miss checking up on Harry's progress, not knowing what was around the corner for him. I'm looking forward to hearing how he got on with the post-war period. January 14, 2010 Jim said...Thanks, Bill - it has been a genuine pleasure to watch Harry's story unfold. Really appreciate your efforts not only in telling his story but also posting the contemporary photos, maps, and the accounts of your battlefield visits. Best wishes to you and the Lamin family. From Jim in Washington State, USA. January 14, 2010 Roger O'Keeffe said...I'd already read the book to the end (the temptation to finish it was irresistible!), but still wanted to check in from time to time to know if he is home yet. The "here and now 90 years on" is still a powerful emotional draw. I'm feeling a strange emptiness now, an anti-climax. What must it have been like for Harry and all his comrades, when they finally made it home? They must have felt pretty drained, and wondered what all the preceding years of hardship were for: was it worth it? Probably nostalgia for their mates, both for those that didn't make it, and for those that did survive, but most of whom they would rarely if ever see again. Most accounts indicate that the survivors rarely said much to their families about "what it was like" - both because they wanted to shelter their families from the worst and because words couldn't adequately describe it. For many years it was only among their peers that they would open up and talk about their experiences to those who could understand. A marvellous achievement, Bill, and a great memorial to an ordinary chap who just did what was expected of him. And now it's time for me to head back to the Somme in early 1917, just opposite the British positions on the Ancre, where Dieter has had a more than ample baptism of fire but still has so much to go through. January 14, 2010 Roger, if you have a "strange emptiness now", &nbsp;it begins to explain the devastating feelings I'm experiencing. BL colagirl said...He's home! He's home! He's actually home! I can't believe it! I'm actually tearing up a bit as I sit here....What a wonderful, wonderful journey. Thank you so much for posting this blog and letting us share Harry's life experiences. I wish you (and Harry) all the best...Dana, Illinois, USA January 14, 2010 Kittybriton said...Welcome Home Harry. I'm so glad to read that you're home at long last after all you've been through. And for standing up to the Kaiser, thank you. January 15, 2010 Endeavourer said...I kept "behind" with the book until late 2009 when I read to the end and was relieved to find Harry's military career was soon to end. I feel privileged to haved shared in a small part of your adventure, Bill, in the trip to Flanders in May 2008. My granddad served in the Sherwood Foresters from 1916, he went 'over the top' twice, and though he survived the Great War his life was badly damaged by it. He lived till my teens and Harry's blog has helped me understand his personal experiences with great pride - Many Thanks! David January 15, 2010 William Watt said...Hello Bill, My dad was born 10 years after Harry and served in the Army after immigrating to the United States in 1913 from what is now Northern Ireland. He never saw any action in WW I, although his brother did, but they never talked about it. I’ve followed your blog daily and very much appreciate what you have done.Thanks, Bill January 14, 2010 The co-ordinator said...It's been a great (true) story, everything good that blogging and the internet can bring.I look forward to your final few round-ups about the characters but then I will have a gap in my daily browsing which will be difficult to fill.

Thanks Bill for sharing this. Devon UK January 13, 2010 Anne Jones said... So glad that Harry is home at last. I shall miss checking up on him, and I hope life was good to him back in England. NOW I can go and buy the book. I would have been too tempted to peak at the end, and I've really enjoyed reading it this way first. Thank you Bill. . UK January 13, 2010 Bryce said...Hi Bill, This was a wonderful story, and I'm happy that it reached such a good conclusion for Harry. Like many other readers, I will be sad to see it go, and I'll certainly miss seeing new entries appear in my RSS feed list from day to day. All the best to you and yours. Bryce San Angelo, Texas January 13, 2010 Marta said... What a happy letter and such a happy conclusion. I can't wait for the epilogue with what Harry ended up doing, if he was able to and wanted to return to Trumans or if he found some other occupation. I recall he said he never wanted to be a cook after doing so for such a long time in Italy. So I'm sure he didn't do that if there wasn't an opening at his old place. Thank you for providing this insight into a war often passed over very lightly in our United States school systems. Why, I don't know. It was a very important period of history. My grandfather fought in this war too. I was happy to find several fiction authors devote novels and series of novels to this war and have fleshed out my understanding by reading these well researched volumes. Thank you again. Can't wait to read how all the loose ends of your family get tied up. Pennsylvania USA January 13, 2010 Felna said...I know a lot have said it all already, but thankyou again for sharing these letters. Like many I've been following this blog and Harry's fortunes. Thank you also for directing me to Dieter Finzen and his blog which does the same for the other side - it has been most enlightening. January 13, 2010 I'm not sure that "the other side" applies. I get more and more to feel that all the ordinary soldiers were, sadly, actually on the same side. BL Curt said... All I can say is "Well Done!"Curt January 13, 2010 Stefan said...

It is indeed sad that the failure of the middle order has become a subject of finger-pointing exercise; post the defeat of the Indian team against the Sri Lankans in the final test. One cannot forget the fact that cricket is a team game and the failure of a team to win a match cannot and should not be attributed to the failure or success of a couple of individuals. The performance of the Indian middle-order, especially that of the big four left much to be desired, would be stating the obvious. But to put the blame for the defeat on these men alone would be too simplistic. Cricket is a team game and the team as a whole has to own up responsibility. What is alarming is the fact that none of these India-Sri Lanka tests stretched beyond the third or fourth day. This definitely isn’t a good sign for both the teams. The Indian camp has reason to be more worried for being at the wrong end in the final test. One might be tempted to attribute this to the failure of the Indian middle-order. The Indian middle-order, made up of highly experienced and classy individuals who have lorded over some of the best spinners in the world, were ironically done-in by a pair of spinners from within the sub-continent. No doubt, these players are in their twilight years of cricket and time is perhaps ripe to find and groom replacements for some of these great men, but it isn’t going to be easy. We should learn to be patient and be prepared to face some initial set-backs for long-term gains. Fortunately, we have enough talent readily available but the enormous experience and sheer greatness of these men presently donning the Indian middle-order would be hard to replace. The Indian bowling also needs some revamp. The spinners have been no match for the Sri Lankans and haven’t been consistent. Overall, the Indian bowling remains another weak-link in the side and will need some dressing up. The Sri Lankans can be proud of beating the Indians in their own game. Never before in the history of cricket have spinners been able to dominate the Indians, as the duo of Murali and Mendis did in this series. Mendis was easily the find of the series and I am sure we are going to hear a lot more about him in the coming years. The Indians haven’t still figured him out completely, notwithstanding claims to the contrary from the Indian camp. His eight wicket haul in the final test bears this out. However, I strongly believe Murali’s presence was largely responsible for his phenomenal success. Fortunately for Mendis, Murali has some more years of cricket left in him. Together, the duo can rock some of the best teams in the world. It would be interesting to see how the Aussies play this duo! The manner in which the Indians have lost the first test to the Sri Lankans is absolutely shocking. The abject surrender in just one and a half days of play by a team which is renowned for its prowess in playing quality spin bowling is appalling, to say the least. Some of the best spin bowlers in the world have struggled to make a mark against Indians and it is disturbing that a couple of spinners from the sub-continent have dealt a crushing blow to this reputation and reduced the Indian domination of spin bowling to a myth. What is even more worrying is the manner in which the Indians lost their wickets. That most wickets fell to close-catching positions (catches at slips, forward short-leg, lbw’s, caught and bowled, etc.) is an indication that all is not well with the Indian batting. It is clear that most batsmen failed to read the balls being hurled at them and ended up messing up their strokes. To think that the Sri Lankans scored 600 runs on the same wicket, with four of their batsmen getting hundreds, is even more disturbing. There was no devil in the wicket and if at all it did, it only existed in the minds of the Indians. The Indian batting line-up was thought to be one of the best in the world, but the inept display we saw today is a cause for serious concern. If the Indians are hoping to make a come-back in this series, there was no indication of that whatsoever in the way the Indians meekly surrendered to the guile of the Sri Lankan spinners. This is not to take the credit away from the Sri Lankan spinners. Muthiah has proved what made him to be the highest wicket taker in the world, and in Mendis, he has found an able partner to rock the Indian boat. That the duo managed to do this on a “not-very-spinner-friendly track” should be a disconcerting thought for the Indian camp and an indication on what to expect in the series. The onset of Mendis seems to have sharpened the lethality of Muthiah, and unless Indians do some serious soul-searching, the series might well turn out to be a one-sided affair. Sadly, the Indian spinners have turned out to be no match for their Sri Lankan counterparts. The Indian spinners should stop looking for spinner-friendly tracks every time they need to take wickets. It is time for Harbhajan to deliver on unhelpful tracks……If Muthiah can deliver with Mendis, why not Harbhajan with Kumble? The big question when India left for Australia was whether Kumble and Co had it in them to pick 20 wickets. Not much was asked of India's 'famed' batting line-up. The reason was clear. A plethora of runs against Pakistan in familiar conditions gave them a false sense of security. There were no demons in the MCG pitch; nor was the home side's bowling menacing to warrant two sub-200 scores. In fact the wicket was more Indian than Australian and the bounce was true till the end. It was disheartening to see the Indians surrender meekly. The crushing defeat in the first Test has opened the big debate again on the famous batting line-up's ability to score runs in tougher conditions. It was the bowlers who orchestrated India's Test wins in South Africa and England. The batsmen have consistently failed to deliver when taken out of their comfort zone. Notwithstanding the odd good knock, the bitter truth is there is not enough firepower in our batting to challenge sides such as Australia and South Africa. The seeds for India's appalling show were sown in the first innings. After the bowlers had managed to keep the Aussies to a reasonable score, the batsmen failed to keep the match alive. The result was on the wall the moment India was set a target of 499. The match was lost on day two. The batsmen would have done well to get some runs on the board and minimise the margin of defeat. The shot selection of the top-order left a lot to be desired. The approach of Dravid and Jaffer continues to puzzle me. How on earth are runs going to come in Australia if batsmen continue to defend balls that have run written all over them? Scoring areas have to be identified and every opportunity has to be seized. India's strength is scoring off boundaries but they will be tough to come by on these big grounds and against Australia's watertight fielding. They will have to create plan B. It is important for the visitors to approach the remainder of the series with a positive frame of mind and not delve too much into this defeat. There is no harm in bringing in Virendar Sehwag. It is vital to have one player at the top of the order who can unsettle the attack. If Yuvraj has to be sacrificed it has be to done in the interest of the team. It will be harsh on the southpaw after just one match. But it is important Kumble gets the strategy right before it proves too late. I liked what the Indian skipper said after the match. He insisted the batsmen have to bat more freely and that to me will lift the gloom that seems to have descended on the team. Patience is wearing thin with India's poor running between the wickets and fielding efforts. The attack can do with all the help they can receive from the fielders. The Aussie intensity even in the fourth innings was admirable. The Indians can take a leaf out of that. It has certainly not been the best of starts but Sydney provides a chance for India to redeem themselves. The wicket at the SCG has always assisted spin and India should continue with two spinners. Dravid going back to his familiar number three is also important for the team's success. Bring in Sehwag at the top and force the World Champions do some thinking. The distance is alarming. What looked like a classic match up between the World 50-50 champions and T20 champions is turning out to be anything but. Each of the first three games has proved beyond doubt the difference in class. Superior athleticism has only widened the gulf. The Aussies have come here with a definite plan and a bruised ego. The strip in Kochi and the one at Hyderabad should have favoured the hosts than anyone else. Though they were not turners by any stretch of imagination there was enough for the tweakers to exploit. The team looks jaded and disoriented. The body language is negative. The third game was a bigger disappointment. Dhoni and his band should have got a measure of the visitors by now. The bowlers are suffering for lack of discipline. They are either too full or short, the three quarter length that Stuart Clarke and Mitchell Johnson hit is ideal on these wickets and the sooner the Indians resort to that length the better. The start in Bangalore and Kochi was wasted. The new ball did initial damage but the momentum was not to be sustained. It has a lot to do with the energy levels. The fielders don't swoop on the ball rather they wait for it come to them. Lack of urgency in the field is hitting the team dearly. With any other side in World cricket one can make up with brilliance with the bat or ball but poor running between the wickets, poor throwing and dropped catches all add up sizably against the World champs. Give an inch they end up with a mile. Coming to the game on Friday, M.S. Dhoni might have been a trifle unlucky with the toss. The wicket looked like losing pace as the day wore. After a good start Australia was pegged back by some good bowling by Harbhajan and Yuvraj Singh. The new rule that insists on the ball to be changed after the 34 th over has not been kind to the men in blue. Runs have been plundered in that phase. The best bowlers must be preserved for that phase. The ball might be a used one that is cleaned but there is a huge difference between a sphere that is used in practice and one that is used in a match. The hardness will be pronounced and it will come on to the bat better. It is an area captains will have to start putting some thought to. From 166 for three in 34 overs Australia plundered 124 runs in the next 16 at 7.75 per over on a wicket that was getting increasingly difficult to bat on. Once the target went beyond 260 it was always going to be an uphill climb for the Indian's. Yuvraj is doing justice to his enormous talent finally. He has always played the occasional blinder but the consistency he has brought to his game is refreshing. The team management can look up to him now for runs during crisis consistently. His shot selection has improved considerably and for a player blessed with enormous natural ability, it is only a question of getting into the right frame of mind. Yuvraj is in that 'zone' where nothing much can go wrong. Physically he did not look at his best yet played one of the best knocks in recent times. The match further showed the importance of a solid top-order. Mathew Hayden makes the difference at the top for his side with his consistency. Matches cannot be won in the Power Play phase but one can set up a solid launch pad. 75 for three at the end of 20 overs was not the ideal start when chasing a big target. The opening overs will have to be counted. The problems are aplenty for Dhoni, The team has to start believing it can beat Australia and for that to happen they have to be more positive on the field. Hearty congratulations to the Indian team. The indomitable spirit proved decisive in the end. Not having a reputation to live up to was the blessing in disguise. M.S. Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh did not meet expectations in the final yet India pulled it off, thanks to players accepting responsibility and not getting overawed by the big stage. It was a fearless and modern approach from a bunch of youngsters in a format that is still foreign to many. Both sides played a final which, made it worthy and only a mistake as elementary as one would get to see from the usually cool and collected soul, Misbah-ul-Haq was to be the difference between a nation rejoicing and another left in despair. There was not much to choose from the two sides. There were many positives India can draw from this campaign. The foremost being the captaincy of Dhoni who remained unruffled throughout the championship. His calming influence was the apex on which, the Indian wave rode. There was no place for individuals. Every win was constructed on the nucleus called 'team effort', it helped shatter myths. No one was indispensable. If there was one player who was unable to deliver, there were two putting their hands up to chip in. The T20 has caught the imagination of the public and this win will herald a new era. As there were one-day specialists trying to make a mark in the early '90's, there will be a set of players who will train their thoughts and mind entirely to suit the demands of this format. One thing is certain there would be no place here for pretenders. Dhoni winning the toss was a huge favour he did to his side. The pressure of a World Cup final and add the name of the opponents, it would be an uphill task to chase the most meager of targets for India. Gautham Gambhir who received so much flak for not coming good against quality opposition silenced his critics with a knock that gave his team a chance to fight. His shot selection was sublime and effective at the same time. Rohit Sharma was a revelation; the youngster came good whenever an opportunity presented itself. The target was never going to be tough if Pakistan resorted to percentage cricket. Sorry that cannot be achieved in a India-Pakistan clash. The pressure gets to you at some point and the mistakes start creeping in. Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik went into a shell and handed over the match to India. Misbah is a player who takes calculated risks and believes in the theory the match is not over until the last ball. It reminded me of the great Javed Miandad who pulled the rug from under our feet on numerous occasions. R.P. Singh delivered when it mattered and so did Irfan Pathan with his canny slow cutters. The entire pace and power had to be generated by the batsmen as Joginder, and the Pathan siblings provided them with nothing. It was a tactical ploy that worked on a wicket that slowed down a touch towards the end of the Pakistan innings. A week from now no single player will be remembered, while the whole team would be. The most defining moment would yet be the brutal assault of Yuvraj on a hapless Stuart Broad. The knock made the team believe it can test the best, and it was great to see the team carry the momentum from there. It was no fluke as the best in the business were left on the wayside. The transition has started. It is up to the selectors to try and help players from this team make a seamless change to the ODI squad. The win has ushered in a new era. Looking back the team was only a stroke away from defeat but they held their nerves. Pakistan threw away an opportunity. Misbah was better off hitting the ball straight and the shot he tried was never going to come off against the pace of Joginder. The man who took them to the doorsteps of glory muffed it with a piece of poor cricket thinking. The pressure of India-Pakistan cricket has made a Mickey out of the best and it was no surprise it even had a cool head thinking otherwise. Indian batting displayed its true strengths and potential on the second day at the oval as they piled 348 more runs in addition to their overnight score of 316 runs. Indian first innings ended at a mammoth 664 all out but not before the cricket fans were treated to a feast of batting. In Test cricket, half the match is won if the team batting first piles up a big enough total in the first innings and aims for an overwhelming result of an innings victory over the opposition. The Australians have perfected this art and hence they are the number one side in the world now. It is very special to see the In
ians getting into this act and executing it in conditions away from home. Cricket is a funny game and we have seen sides squander, given the best of batting conditions. Nothing of that sort happened today and the Indians made the best use of the pitch and started from where they left on day 1. England bowling was found much in wanting and their quality was exposed a great deal by a superlative Indian batting. A tally of over 50 in the extras, wickets for part-timers like Collingwood and Pietersen, and the absence of Sidebottom for a significant part of the day, made the English bowling look pedestrian and ineffective; full marks to the Indian team for taking full advantage of the wayward English bowling and putting up a total that reflected a complete team effort. Cricket is a team game and it takes all members of a side to contribute one way or the other for writing a success story. Today, the Indian batting was no less than a spotless team effort, with almost all batsmen contributing significantly with the willow, which made the mammoth 600 plus score a reality. Tendulkar and Laxman started the day's proceedings and the latter's innings had class stamped all over it -studded with 10 glorious hits to the fence. When the best of batsmen in world cricket today is willing to wait and spend a good time in the crease, it is ominous for the opposition. Laxman and Tendulkar built 78 for the fifth wicket before Laxman was dismissed. Tendulkar's hard-working innings was once again left unrewarded as he was dismissed caught in the slips for a well-made 82. 417/6 could have easily become 450 – 460 all out, with the tail-enders meekly surrendering their wickets, but that was not to be. The determination of the lower order to contribute runs to the team’s kitty is what separates a normal team from a great team. The Indian lower order showed grit and confidence in scoring runs. The final four wickets fell to a substantial addition of 247 runs, but there was more to it than mere statistics. Mahendra Singh Dhoni was in his usual belligerent mood, smashing a quick-fire 92 of just 81 deliveries and his innings was studded with 9 fours and four sixes. The baton of run scoring changed from the belligerent Dhoni to a determined Kumble. A batsman, after getting a body blow, can easily develop mental block and fade away. It takes a strong character to show determination to fight it out in the middle, and Anil Kumble is not new to this as he had shown us in the West Indies in 2002, when he was hit in the chin while batting and still came back to bowl and claim Brian Lara's wicket. This time it was his batting that made all the difference, for a change!! He has the earned the distinction of being the first Indian to score a century in this series. This knock is perfectly befitting a man who has won many a matches for India in his glorious career, and perhaps, in his final Test in England. Kumble's unbeaten 110 was studded with as many as 16 hits to the fence and one over the ropes as well. Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh also chipped in with decent contributions to help Kumble reach his century and take India to a commanding position in this Test match. England have only themselves to blame for some bad bowling, ordinary fielding and mediocre behind-the-stumps effort, with byes accounting 33 of the total 54 extras, much to the dismay of Matt Prior. Wicket-keepers in cricket are best judged by the number of byes they concede and England seems to be lacking in that area as well. Lots to cheer for India on their on-field exploits today and lots to think for the England team management at the end of the second day's play at the Oval. With Kumble scoring a 100, one would fancy his bowling to come good for India. If it does happen, this test might well be remembered for Kumble’s exploits and greatness as a tough cricketer. Coming to the English batting, if the Indian bowlers can get Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pieterson out early, it will be half the match won. I am looking forward to more positive cricket from the Indians, as do the millions of you fans of Indian cricket out there. It is imperative for Team India to keep the momentum going. A closer look at history reveals that India almost immediately hand over the advantage after taking the lead in an away Test series. The latest example was the tour to South Africa where the cricket became suddenly unimaginative after the win in Johannesburg. The focus should be on continuing the good work. A win can make a team to take it a bit easy, and Rahul Dravid and his men would do well to continue with the positive ways and not get caught in a negative mindset. Sourav Ganguly proved his detractors wrong and there should be no doubt that the visitors will play the same team in the final Test. Runs are available aplenty at the Oval. The first morning might have something in it for the bowlers but from day two it should become a perfect batting strip. It would take a gutsy captain to bat first on this wicket. Batting second would be a safer option and batting last at the Oval is not a tedious job. I would expect Dravid to take field if he is to win the toss. With the lead already in hand India has a good chance of batting England out of the series. The form of V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav has provided the cutting edge. It is always important for the middle order to fire at the Old Blighty. Once the second new ball is on life can be difficult even for the batsman who is well settled. Chris Tremelet with his bounce and lift proved what he is capable of and the Indian's should have chalked out a plan for him by now. The difference between victory and defeat even for the mighty Aussies hinged on Adam Gilchrist's success at seven in the last two tours. In 2001 he had the English bowling at his mercy but in 2005 he was not half his own self and that tilted the balance in the hosts favour. It is important for Dhoni to contribute with Sourav and Laxman. One bad session and things can turn upside down. The bowling department looked no good on paper but it has exceeded expectations. Zaheer Khan has taken the burden of spearheading the attack brilliantly. Add Sreesanth's inability to deliver Zaheer's work stands taller. The success of Zaheer has a lot to do with the attention he has started to pay at what is happening at the other end. He has learnt to deal differently with each batsman. Bowling is two-way traffic. There will phases in a match where a bowler will have to get to run-control mode but that is not getting defensive it is just a part of a ploy to get to the batsmen. Zaheer has done just that and add Anil Kumble's ability to mop the tail quickly the duo has more than made up for the lack of consistency on Sreesanth's part. R.P. Singh has been the surprise element. His deceptive pace and his strong wrist is tailor made for English conditions and his ability to move the ball both ways has left even the best a confused lot. With the top three performing brilliantly, the only change that could possibly happen is R. Bose coming in place The visitors should approach the game as they would to any other. It has happened in the past, the team has tried defensive ploys when they are trying to defend a hard earned lead. It has cost them dear and this resurgent side that has shown great mental fortitude and losing the grip after gaining the lead could be a thing of the past. There may have been a bit of a stutter at the end. The rest of the Test was one smooth flow for Team India. Not for a moment did Rahul Dravid and his boys look like the side that was saved by the elements when defeat looked inevitable in the opener at Lord's. The opening partnership between Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik in the first innings swung the game so much in the visitor's favour that it never gave England a chance in the match. A handy first innings did the hosts in. As it happened at Lord's, it is difficult for a side to wriggle out of a tight corner once the momentum goes to the other side. With a lead of 283, all India needed was one good session with the ball on the fourth day to warp up the Test. It was good toss to win for Dravid and his spearhead Zaheer Khan responded well. The conditions were loaded in favour of the bowlers but it must be said that it was intelligent bowling that helped to keep England to below 200. The best part of Zaheer's performance was his ability to keep a high percentage of his deliveries in the good length area. With the wicket helping the ball to seam, it was important for the bowlers to bowl in the right areas. While Sreesanth seemed to get lost in his act of the comedic villain, the emergence of R.P. Singh as a strike force came as a breather. Rahul could ill afford two of his bowlers to be off the radar in the same game. R.P. Singh who is generally taken lightly can be deceptively sharp. His strong and straight wrist that helps the fingers to follow the seam all the way through in his action is his biggest ally. His high arm action helps him generate bounce and also to skid the ball off the surface when he bowls a fullish length. Both Zaheer and Singh were tough to negotiate as they moved the ball either way. It is not easy for the batsmen when it moves both ways and it leads to doubts creeping in. The conditions were better for batting in the second innings as the wicket had eased out. It needed a strong will and self-belief in the bowlers. They succeeded with style and panache. Anil Kumble played his usual role of mopping up the tail quickly and his contribution with the bat and his half-century association with V.V.S. Laxman were vital to the plot. It was a win where almost everyone played his part to perfection. What I enjoyed most was the ruthlessness of the Indians. They did not give a chance for England to come back in to the game. The innings by Michael Vaughan was a class act. It did not get its due as the media trained its thoughts on the Indian win. Until the English skipper was in, there was a good chance of the game to end in a draw. To India's credit, their shoulders did not droop while Paul Collingwood and Vaughan were making merry. A bit of luck was required on this shirtfront and it arrived in the form of Vaughan's wicket. Once that partnership was broken it was only a matter of time. As I had said before, the team needed the top guns to click collectively. The top-order contributed handsomely. It was the sixth highest Test match total without a single hundred. Sourav Ganguly came up with a classy knock and proved his detractors, including yours truly, wrong. The seniors in the team whose very presence in the team was being questioned came to the party and the youngsters complemented their efforts well. It was a resurgent side that deserved every inch of this famous win.
OK I thought the first post was long enough as it is, so here is the second part of my rig building process. The next component in question is the Power Supply a.k.a PSU. I never really thought I have to invest in something like a PSU. I didn't quite expect the choice of PSU to be of high importance and now after enough enlightenment from my fellow PC assemblers, I have learned to respect them. The choice of the PSU can either power your system or can blow your rig sky high or it can melt your motherboards beyond recognition. Power Supply Unit Corsair VX450W My New System , originally uploaded by Rakesh Ashok . As I was saying above the PSU is also a very important part of any rig. This wasn't the first choice that came to the mind of TE members when I asked for suggestions for PSU. The first was the Gigabyte Superb 460W and the second was Seasonic S12II-380W. Both these were really good products from what I read from reviews elsewhere. Then after assessing that the Seasonic was better than the Gigabyte product I decided to go with it. But unfortunately the place where I went to seek out this product haven't even of the name Seasonic. One guy even took and gave me a zebronics PSU. Zebronic and Seasonic does sound a lot similar don't they. Again I had to look out for alternatives. Thus I came upon the Corsair VX 450W. Well it was a bit too costly for me though. Nevertheless it is the perfect fit. Best features of this PSU are really quite fan and nylon sleeved wires for better wire management in your cabinet. Bought this PSU for a princely sum of 4050Rs in Richie Street. Though right now its an overkill for my current config without a GPU. But it definitely is a good choice considering the fact that I would definitely get myself a GPU probably the ATI Radeon HD5770 or the 5750. Here are some reviews to help you along with your decision.

The song lyrics are too good even though I had a hard time understanding most of the words since they don't seem to be the regular hindi words which I usually hear or some other kind of dialect, not really sure which one.

Till now I was using a Pentium III computer which has survived well past its shelf life. I was also getting annoyed using that system since I can't watch HD video in it, I can't play some games if I get bored, I can't even multitask since it hangs if I do so. So I decided it is finally time to upgrade my system. And this is it. I assembled the entire rig on my own. I took liberal advice from my Tech Enclave friends to decide upon the components. Here are the individual components. Processor AMD Athlon II X4 620 Quad Core Image Source: bit-tech.net I remember myself hating AMD in the early days since it was dead slow and never performed as advertised (experience from using my friends computer). But what I hadn't realized is that AMD put away all those things behind them and have started delivering better goods for cheap and is right now giving Intel a run for its money. Now my CPU i.e. the Athlon II X4 is a Quadcore processor meaning it has four processors built in one chip. This is the first Quadcore in the market that sells at around 5K. The Intel Quadcore is nearly double or more. I was initially planning on a Intel based system but was blown away by the AMD offering. Here are some reviews about this CPU. AMD Athlon II X4 620: Quad Core For The Masses At $100 AMD Athlon II X4 620 &amp; 630: The First $99 Quad Core CPU AMD Athlon II X4 620 CPU Review After reading all that review I'm sure you can imagine why I switched to AMD. I got it for 5200Rs in Chennai. The CPU doesn't get very hot so the stock CPU fan is enough for cooling it. It's totally unnecessary to waste money on CPU coolers for this CPU. The maximum temperature I have seen is around 40 degree but usually runs at around 32-34 degrees. Motherboard Asus M4A785TD-V EVO Image Source: unitycorp.co.jp Choosing the motherboard was the toughest decision I took while building my rig. For starters I had absolutely no idea about the various technologies involved. The brands, features it was mind numbing. So after hearing the first two or three suggestions from the TE gang, I started exploring those motherboards and their features. Almost all suggested the Gigabyte board, Gigabyte 785GMT-UD2H . This is a micro ATX board meaning a smaller sized board. I had decided to go with this board. When I reached Richie Street I was not able to find this board. Since I was at that time impatient I decided to go with an alternative having the exact same features. Thus I bought the Asus M4A785TD-V EVO. Well the name Asus is not new in the motherboard, infact it is among the top contenders in the market. The highlights of the board are Full ATX board supporting AM3 CPUs , DDR3, IGP (ATI HD4200), 128MB of DDR3 sideport memory, two PCI-e 2.0 slots lots of USB slots and lots more. The real plus point is that I can fit bigger GPUs in the future when I buy one. :) This board is quite heavy and it fills your Cabinet, so make sure you buy a bigger cabinet for this one. This is also the costliest component in my Rig excluding my monitor of course. It cost me 6600Rs . bit-tech.net Review - Asus M4A785TD-V Evo review Overclock3D :: Review :: Asus M4A785TD-V EVO 785G ATX Preview Read the second part of my rig building process <!-- Its hard to come by wallpapers for my E51.

Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved 's next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and "fly" underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I'd like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ridden one? 7)&nbsp; Isn't there an easier way to spell "ichthyosaur?"&nbsp; Maybe with less h's?

But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named 'scythe lizard' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them "turtle-like lizards," prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn't until the discovery of similar genus' in the 80's and 90's, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods.

The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that's what I went with.

Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren't the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months.

We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It's hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a "blog of note" on Google's official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates.

i know, it was early, but they had it on Saturday for some reason. it also rained cats and dogs. Reporters in the rotunda. Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn't get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird. We had escaped to Arizona to feel some heat on our skin and breathe that lingering citrus and desert smell. I was laying in the backyard, my arms tired from a canoe ride that morning and little wooden plates of cheese, crackers and hummus appear from the house and the family gets their picnic on. Half knowingly I left my camera sitting for most of the trip but had to pick it up just to remember how nice it felt to sit on the lawn with the Cricket and her family, feel springs sneak peek, mix German and English mid sentence and eat good cheese. This is Manfred, visiting from Berlin and thoroughly enjoying all that surrounded us. The Bishop of Salt Lake City had some nice light going on at a concert downtown. I had to shoot a fire/suspected arson a few nights ago. It always amazes me how open some people can be in a tragic situation. This mother, her mother and two kids were woken up by a neighbor banging on the door telling them to get out of the house. They didn't have time to get sweaters or coats and had been outside in a Utah winter for at least 25 minutes by the time I arrived. I chatted with them for a bit, they were obviously still shook up and worrying about where they were going to sleep. I asked if I could shoot a few photos for the paper and they said that was fine. I stuck around and we talked for a bit and I started to wonder why they were so open and friendly to a stranger hired to be privy to their problems. These things have been in my mind quite a bit since returning from Haiti. There has been quite a bit of talk about the morality and ethics of photojournalists in Haiti following the quake. I read some of it and had to open up a bit so I wouldn't get too defensive while reading the criticisms of some of the media working down there. I am not afraid of good dialogue so I left a few comments on some of these critical blog postings. My feeling was that, in some cases 'being there' and documenting someones life is an implicit display of respect for the value of the situation. Joy and her mother Sandra (pictured) further cemented this idea for me. There is an entire discussion regarding photographic approach and sensationalism which belongs to this examination, but for this post, I'll just assume that you know what I mean. The problem is that there are hundreds of variables in every sit uation where photos are taken in the name of photojournalism, so an application of some overarching philosophy has it's faults. But as far as this little family is concerned, I felt like they were open to me in that moment because that respect was apparent. Maybe not, but I wanted to at least precede Haiti photos with some sort of introduction into how I feel about what I do and those in the photographs. LGBT community protesting some remarks made in association with the announcement that their issues aren't on the schedule for the Legislative Calendar this year. Whether you are aligned with them or not, it seems like a real cop out from the law makers to just avoid a group of issues...especially when it's coincidentally an election year. Sometimes as a photojournalist you are right in the thick of things and still don't get the full story. From what common sense tells me, avoiding an issue that is obviously really important to large groups of people doesn't seem like representation. Anyone who knows more, specifically about this here in SL is welcome to comment, wouldn't mind being enlightened.
During my trip to Australia in October-November, I visited a few different places but Melbourne was the place that I stayed in between and also spent the rest of my trip. Most people who have been there would know about the unpredictable weather. I don't really like the cold weather but the temperatures in Melbourne were not as damn cold as Hanoi because the humidity is quite low. This trip I feel was very special as it was the second time and I was invited out for dinner a lot by my friend's relatives. I was a bit lazy after the trip and with the blogging. But, once again, I would like to thank them all in this post. I may have missed out someone and please forgive me. I would like to show my special appreciation to Liz, Mark's mother who took care of me for most of the time when I was in Melbourne and also joined the beautiful trip to Tassie. Liz also arranged quite a few different parties to welcome, farewell and for other reasons. I really enjoyed her famous lasagne , one of the best dishes I've had. Sarah and Chris' family is the second to thank as I went to their house many times for dinner. Sarah is a great cook and she can use her talents to cook even the left overs into a beautiful meal. I was really impressed about her food and her food's presentation. I enjoyed your food and great company of your family especially Harvey, Eden and Rosie. They are gorgeous. The third family is Catherine's, Liz's sister. Yes, I love your old house and the Greek meal which reminded me heaps about Greece and was a nice way to remember meeting Cathy and her family in Santorini in 2008. The grilled lamb, salad and dessert was delicious. Thanks alot for the great evening and funny stories about the Melbourne Cup and Nana. Just loved it !!! Emma, Mark's cousin, and her friend Bec travelled around Vietnam at the end of 2008 and this was such a great chance to catch up again and remind each other about some funny stories about riding on the back of the motorbike and being a bit drunk at parties. Thanks Emma, Sam, Luke, Gerry, Damian and their friends that gave me a memorable dinner with beautiful food and wine. Sam is such a gentlemen and really loved his design of the house. Megan, yes, how can I forget about you:). Thanks for the BBQ and great time with your friends. Lisa was very nice and hilarious plus the special discount I got from her work. I do appreciate it very much. Also I would like to thank John who allowed me to stay down there in Anglesea. I can't believe how quickly Angus and Myee have grown up. I was very impressed about your family's zoo. John freaked me out when he showed me the huge lizard. Very warm family atmosphere!!!! Special memory for me was the lady with the saucy beige hair, that's Nana. I love her hair color and her old house. It was really nice seeing Nana again and spending time at Crown but hope we are luckier next time. Thanks all once again for having me and giving me such a great time and looking forward to seeing you again very soon. I spent two weeks in Phu Quoc and everything seemed perfect with great weather and beautiful food, especially the seafood. But as always, there were some issues that came up I went out for lunch on one particular day, walking along the beach just up from the bungalows we stayed at to try to have some different food instead of going into town. Unfortunately, it was a mistake to choose the Lien Hiep Thanh Hotel and Restaurant right on the beach. I ordered grilled squid with salt and chilli, spring rolls and sour broth with tuna. It sounded great as these are specialist dishes from Phu Quoc and most places I've been they had been so nice and yummy. Well, they served us boiled squid instead of grilled and I told the waiter that it was not what we ordered in a polite way but he denied it, telling me this is their restaurant's grilling technique. I was a bit upset and I ended up taking it back to the kitchen myself and they promised to make a new dish for me. Ten minutes later, the same plate came back with the half bitten piece of squid. I couldn't say a word as they were so hopeless and they waiter tried to make a joke but it turned out all stupid. The sour broth with tuna which should be great as it's simple to make was tasteless, the tuna wasn't cooked enough and, if that wasn't enough, the spring rolls tasted like they were from the super market. Totally sucked down there at the Lien Thanh!!!! No tip and worst meal of my life. On another point, I was expecting the food at the night market to be cheap but it didn't work that way. Most restaurants at the night market were more expensive than restaurants in town and in the hotel. A prawn cost $4, 4 pieces of squid cost $5, a pice of tuna cost $5. Hello!!! this is Phu Quoc, an island where you can catch fish anywhere. Yesterday we wanted to find something different for breakfast after tennis. After wandering around, we stopped at a chicken and duck noodle and salad stand. We ordered one bowl of vemicelli with chicken and one noodle soup with chicken. We thought that'd be ok and cheap but the lady kept asking us about our order and confusing us. Other people in the restaurant are shaking their heads. I didn't really understand if their reaction meant that they knew her or what? Anyway, we ended up with two bowls of vemicelli with chicken and it costs 150,000VND. I couldn't say a thing, I was so shocked. I couldn't believe my ears. I thought she's probably going to say it's New Year which is a common excuse to rip tourists off. She didn't say anything. We just had to accept her price! I told people from the hotel and they thought I was joking. This really pisses me off and this is not the first time as well. My friends invited me to have dinner at a Thai restaurant in Vincom Tower a few weeks ago. It was the weekend and it was really crowded, full of smoke and noisy. We could hardly hear our conversation unless we spoke very loud, almost shouting. We ordered chicken soup, prawn soup, mango salad, stir fried mixed vegetables, french fries, stir fried corn and finished with a hot pot. We always order too much and we couldn't finish all of the food. I really like the mango salad as the mango was very fresh and a bit spicy and the rest of our food wasn't too bad but they use a bit too much coconut milk in the soups. Like many Vietnamese, my friends didn't enjoy that much as they thought it was too spicy, sweet and fatty. They were right about some of that but I tried to explain to them about Thai food always being spicy. We didn't have a good time and I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone as there are plenty of nice Thai restaurants in town which are not that expensive. We spent over 1.7 million dong on our meal for 5 of us which is about $95. As some of my good friends went back home during my birthday in December, I decided to celebrate instead in January. We prepared Italian winter food as the winter weather was still around but unluckily, the weather changed on the day to such a beautiful sunny and quite warm day. We even had to switch on the air-conditioning, which is really unusual for Hanoi at this time of the year. We served some cheese, bread, marinated mushrooms and wine to welcome everyone and for the dinner, we cooked Italian soup called minestrone, roasted chicken with with lemon zest, olives and tomatoes. For the side dishes, we cooked roast potatoes, and made a beetroot salad and pan-fried asparagus with parmesan cheese. Thanks to my good friends for coming and making it such a great fun night. I am in Phu Quoc, the place to be!!! This is my second time here but I feel like I know this place very well. The people I met last time, from the hotel staff to the people who live around, are all still here. They are gorgeous with smiling faces and so sweet. We're staying at the Thanh Kieu Resort , the same place I stayed last time. I was lucky enough to get a room here as I booked way in advance as I heard some people couldn't get a room or had to pay lots of money for due to Tet holiday. This is the first time I am not going home for Tet. I just want to do something different as I've been home every year for the last 8 years. I also want to spend sometime here to relax and enjoy myself. I do love my city but I went home last month to visit my family and my mother seemed happy with my decision. The weather in Phu Quoc is so beautiful compared to the freezing cold in Hanoi and it makes me feel so great. I am going to go to the beach to relax for the first few days and read a bit then off to the city for dinner at the night market which has the best food in town and REALLY CHEAP!!!! They're cooking fresh seafood in the Phu Quoc style which is a bit different compared to other cities in Vietnam. I will eat all of my favorites, especially stir fried crab with tamarind sauce. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it!!! Happy Tet every one and see you in the next few posts. I was walking through the old quarter yesterday and saw so many young people sitting along Dinh Liet street eating snails. I have to say that snails have never been on my list of must eat things as I had trouble a few years ago when I ate some snails at the Old Man restaurant in To Ngoc Van street in West Lake. I had a stomach upset for 3 days in the row after eating snails on that occasion. I told myself that I shouldn't look but I actually did look and wanted to try them again. I ordered two bowls of two different kinds and also asked the waitress to give me lots of ginger and chiili. These snails don't actually have any special flavors at all but the dipping sauce which includes fish sauce, ginger, chilli and lemon is what makes the dish special. While I was sitting there trying to finish the two bowls I occupied myself by watching people walk past and by taking photos of this dish. I hoped that eating lots of ginger and chilli would help to protect my stomach. By now, after 24 hours, I am still ok and I wouldn't mind going back again. If you have lots of time to spend, this is such a good place as it's cheap and a great location. It's pretty exciting for me when I'm able to get down to Saigon for a few days to see my dentist and visit my sister. It's nice to be in the sun and eat my favorite food from the south. Food in the south is getting dearer but it's well cooked, fresh and tasty and worth the money. After I visited my dentist, my sister took me out for dinner with her family and our nephew by the river. We had a such a beautiful meal there, ordering coconut salad with chicken skin, stir fried duck eggs with tamarind sauce, fried rice with eggs and garlic, stir fried beef served with vegetables, pine apple and fresh noodles, and the last dish was Thai hopot. They're all really tasty and the bill came out amazingly cheap. The next day, my niece's boyfriend invited everyone out for breakfast and we chose to go to Lam Son beef steak restaurant. It sounds funny to have a beef steak for breakfast but this is a common thing to do in the south. We had a mixed beef steak which includes fried egg, ham and french fries. It's surprisingly nice and the place is generally really crowded. Good to eat something different instead of chicken noodle soup - pho ga - all the time :). In the evening, my nephew took everyone out to have Keo fish hotpot which is one of my local favorite even though I am not really into river fish. We ordered some grilled river prawns, grilled Keo fish, grilled squid and Keo hotpot. We were totally full after all and I couldn't even move. It's really nice being with family especially as I'm very close to my sister and my nephew. It's good to see them again and I will be back here briefly at Tet after my trip to Phu Quoc. Looking forward to that!
I was going over what I was writing about the bullpen when compared with last season, and unfortunately I don't think I can make a comparison until Opening Day. I have no idea, outside of the mainstays (K-Rod, Feliciano, Parnell), who will be on the roster. The short summary is that I was pumped for the 8-9 combo of Putz and K-Rod last season, bullpens are notoriously unpredictable year to year, and Ambiorix Burgos may have killed someone with his car. As of now, I'm not even all that certain who the fifth starter will be. The team seems intent on having that be either Niese or Nieve, but neither is pitching like they want the job (at least not when compared to Misch and Figueroa). So, my bullpen summary will be postponed until next month, when I have a clue as to the composition. That being said, there are some position battles that the organization are ignoring because they arose out of injury. Shortstop: Jose Reyes and his overactive thyroid has opened an every day job for Alex Cora. Cora is a known commodity, which is one of my favorite backhanded compliments. I'm no expert with major league playing time and minor league options, but I'd like to see Tejada man the spot. He's hitting well enough right now, and I'm not sure how much that counts in Spring, but its better than not hitting at all. I'm not sure the Mets want to do that, but I think it's time we start looking at developing this kid, especially when I hear his defense and speed are major-league ready. Centerfield: Poor Gary Matthews, Jr. What am I saying? Rich Gary Matthews, Jr. Whatever you call him, he's the odd man out in the CF battle. The job looks like it will go to Pagan, who, if he realizes his upside, could be a known commodity. I know everyone will have terror flashbacks when they think of Fernando Martinez's cup of coffee last season, but he's tearing the cover off the ball now. Again, this is Spring Training, so it may not be worth much, but maybe he carries that over into the start of the season. I think Manuel should take a good look at F-Mart to start the season. I know these are temporary position battles, but I think that's all the more reason to go with youth. Let's get some young energy out there. Who knows when Beltran returns, and what the condition of his knee is? And with Reyes, I'm certainly no endocrinologist. Here’s my problem with John Maine. I think we’re all getting sick of his tired act. It’s becoming the ‘same ole story’ with this guy. After following Johan Santana's 4-inning gem with a disaster, this is what he had to say: "My mechanics felt fine...I just wasn't kind of that into it. It wasn't good. It's just I wasn't all that prepared. The feeling that it's not my game is the hardest thing. It's a waste of a day." What the fuck is this guy doing on the mound if he's just not that into it? And claiming to be unprepared when you know exactly when you are going to pitch? I don’t get it, is it not your game because Johan Santana started it, it's Spring Training? Suck it up guy and pitch. Stop being a little bitch, that's what you get paid to do. Enough of the sappy follow ups, we don't give a shit, just get it done. Granted, there’s a lot of Spring Training left, and that’s great for John. He better use the time wisely to straighten himself out because I have news for John. If he comes out of the gate stumbling and struggling, his tired nice guy act is not going to fly for too long. He is now two years removed from his stellar 15-10 season, his only full season in the majors. So this season becomes very important for John to prove his worth. Our patience is thin to begin with and there are other guys chomping at the bit that have the ' cojones ' to take his place. Here are possible suitors ready to pounce on Maine's job. You have Hisanori Takahashi who is a veteran student of the game, can start and has been lights out. Jonathon Niese is in line for the 5 th starters' spot, if he doesn ’t win that job, he can steal Maine's. Nelson Figueroa, who no one is talking about, hasn ’t given up an earned run yet. Then there's Fernando Nieve and Jenrry Mejia. I don't think Nieve is the answer, and hopefully Mejia will start the year in the pen. But you catch my drift here, there are options if Maine sucks again. If not any of the above, Mets have stated that financially, they can take on more salary via a trade or what not. John Maine Just Isn't That Into You [NBC] Only the Mets…unbelievable! Mets say Jose Reyes has an overactive thyroid. Jose Reyes is saying: "Los especialistas que me atendieron en Nueva York me dijeron que estaba bien y que no tengo problemas de la tiroide" "Me dijeron que solamente tenía la garganta inflamada y no necesitaba medicinas para la tiroide u otra cosa" "La única recomendación de los especialistas fue que no comiera mariscos por la cantidad de yodo que contienen y que debía chequearme cada tres semanas para ver como sigue todo" Translation: “The specialists that attended me in New York told me that I’m fine and that I don’t have thyroid problems. They told me that I just had throat inflammation and that I don’t need medication for thyroid or anything else. The only recommendation the specialists gave me is to not eat fish due to high iodine it contains and to get checked out every three weeks to see how things are going.” Anyone see Jay Horowitz? Jay Horowitz anyone? Jay, are you there? What does this man get paid to do? Besides that good for nothing PR moron, you have to just scratch your head and say, “What the fuck? Who’s smoking crack here?” It’s got to be one of the following. Either Reyes is lying, or he didn’t understand the doctors. Or are the Mets being overly stupidly cautious to lie due to them being scared shit that god forbid something happens to Reyes if he starts playing and this problem pops up again? See past. This is just getting stupid now. Maybe fathead Jay Horowitz will make an appearance. Diagnóstico diferente de Reyes y Mets [ESPN Deportes] Welcome to "In Memoriam." A segment where we take a moment to celebrate, castigate, and otherwise reminisce on former Mets both good and evil. This edition: The Kid, Gary Carter, and his outrageous new Twitter feed! It wasn’t too long ago when Gary Carter went a little looney on us. Early in 2008, with Willie Randolph on the chopping block, Carter sounded off with a 'pick me I'm available' public pitch to manage the Mets. "I just want them to know of my availability. I'm only a phone call away because my contract allows me to leave the ballclub. I could be in New York tomorrow, if necessary, because if there's anything at the major league level I can leave this job." Carter, being the manager of the Orange County Flyers of the Independent Golden League in California at the time, of course recanted after the firestorm he created. "I want to clear this up especially...I never wanted to try to undermine or do anything to bring this to a situation where I'm trying to campaign for something...I would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. I would love that opportunity. [But] I wish Willie well." Interestingly enough, he also did this in 2004 when Art Howe was taking up space in the dugout. But hold on to your shorts, the Kid is back and rawer than ever on his new Twitter feed - Gary Carter Raw . We've heard about athletes, celebrities, and even the president taking to Twitter. Here comes Gary Carter, spewing outrageous thoughts on everything from fucking single moms, Dykstra and the bathroom blow jobs, to Kevin Mitchell being a snitch, and everything in between. Here's a taste: "Dave Magaden was lactose intolerant. But that didn't stop him from fucking Long Island cows on the daily" On centerfielder-turned-Bernie-Madoff-accompice Lenny Dystra: "When clubs got boring, we'd tell bouncers a homo kid with a mullet was offering BJ's in the mens room. They'd grab Dykstra, he'd fight back" On current Angels manager Mike Sciocia: "Little known fact...the retard in the movie "leaving las Vegas" that rapes Elizabeth Shue in the ass was Mike Scioscia, and he was not acting" Dropping a dime on former teammates: "Sid Fernandez and I coached a little league team in crown heights just to fuck single moms" "Its no surprise Kevin Mitchell left the team... he was a fucking snitch" "I caught Matt Williams jerking off while listening to Sinbads comedy tape on his walkman. Weird thing was I caught him in Will Clark's trunk" "Steve Sax seat on the bench was warmer than Robin Yount's wife's beard!" "I did a short stint as a "Coyote" south of the border...I still technically own Rafael Santana and his family" Need we say more? This is truly a must-follow for Mets fans on Twitter (twitter.com/GaryCarterRaw). Gary, you are a fucking genius, please continue to entertain us. Carter apologizes for comments saying he wanted Mets' job [MLB] Lizzie Grubman and her Power Girls would have never let this happen. In fact, had they done the job, there would not be any complaints about the abstructed view seats at Citi Field. They would have the skill to convince fans that obstructed seats are the new wave and that you aren't anyone unless you had an obstructed seat. So in Citi Field's inagural season, the Mets, instead of letting fans know that the seats they were buying were somewhat obstructed, they hit the airwaves with a retarded statement. I'm still trying to decipher what this means. In a truly bizarre appearance on WFAN, team executive David Howard told fans that they didn't understand the nature of obstructed views because these seats merely had blind spots that meant you weren't able to see the entire field. Huh? It was just one more example of a team battling poor PR with even worse PR. Just as they refused to admit any mistakes with the medical staff or front office employees challenging minor leaguers to fights, they refused to admit that they made a mistake by not telling customers the whole story. Now there will be a warning for fans buying obstructed view seats. Are we seeing a change in PR policy? I doubt it as long as the current PR staff is in place. Warning reads: View: Limited portions of the playing field may not be visible from this seat location. Mets Stop Being Obstructionist About Stadium Obstructions [NBC] As I indicated last week, there is a reasonable expectation that the pitching will improve this season when compared to 2009. However, there are several reasons to expect that improvement to be marginal (though I expect it to be significant). The offense, on the hand, is another matter... Following is the projected lineup comparison (once Beltran returns from knee surgery). 2009 Opening Day Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Daniel Murphy - LF 3. Carlos Delgado - 1B 4. Carlos Beltran - CF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Ryan Church - RF 7. Brian Schneider - C 8. Luis Castillo - 2B 2010 Projected Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Luis Castillo - 2B 3. Carlos Beltran - CF 4. Jason Bay - LF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Jeff Francoeur - RF 7. Daniel Murphy - 1B 8. Rod Barajas - C Let's go by order in the lineup and see what improvements we can expect from this year's team. 1. Obviously, we need more than the 36 games we got last year from Reyes. Oddly, he may start the season in the three slot (this is more apparent after yesterday's Spring Training game), which has arguable merit. The leadoff spot was manned best in Reyes' absence by Angel Pagan until he got hurt. Pagan is my odds-on favorite to win the CF job and get the leadoff slot should Manuel decide to bat Reyes third until Beltran returns. Assuming one month of Pagan and the rest of the season with Reyes, this slot can't help but be a significant improvement over last year. 2. Murph was overhyped coming out of Spring last season. Also, the sky is blue, the President is Black, and Elmer Fudd has problems with the letter "R". On the opposite end, I don't know that we could have expected any less from Castillo. I'd take a repeat of last year from Castillo as the perfect no. 2 slot season (and word is, he's lost more weight and is in better shape this year). 3. Carlos Delgado just had hip surgery - no, not that surgery, this is a new one. I'm sad for him, in part because I thought we could take a late flyer on him with an incentive-laden deal and he could wrestle the job from Murph. Before he got hurt, he was the only guy hitting moon shots to right at Citi Cavern. I think we've seen the last of Delgado, in any uniform. Odds are we'll see Reyes for a month in this slot and then Beltran for the balance of the season. Again, nowhere to go but up. 4. Bay jumps into a slot that was best manned last year by... wait for it... Gary Sheffield. Yes, that Gary Sheffield, who if he lands a job this Spring will have played in four different decades. Bay has his issues, and maybe the back end of this contract will be ugly, but for now he replaces what we thought we'd get from Delgado last year, but from the right side. He will certainly be an improvement over Murph in left and is a .380 OBP guy who slugs over .500 and plays every day. 5. Which David Wright will we get this year? The guy who had his worst season as a pro, or the all-star we had for the previous four seasons. I remember arguments about who you'd take first to start a team - Wright or Pujols (now that argument is Mauer or Pujols). Wright's anemic power may have been the result of little protection, adjustments to a new ballpark, girlfriend troubles, who knows... But, if you're so inclined, take a look at his numbers last year. Ignoring the low homerun total, it wasn't all that bad a year. In fact, it was a pretty good year (144 games, 80+ runs, 70+ rbis and a .390 OBP). Expect his slugging to improve some, Pujols to be caught on the juice and the argument to be Mauer vs. Wright. 6. This is the most underrated position upgrade on the team. Church was a AAAA player. Francoeur may not live up to the promise he showed in his early years as a Brave, but he has good pop, plays great defense in right (he has a sick cannon) and is a takes his lunchpail kind of guy. I wish he'd learn to take a walk, but if you look at his numbers as a Met last year (.311 BA, 10 HR, 40 R, 41 RBI in 75 games), there's proof the change of scenery worked. 7. I'm not a fan of Murph. Keith Hernandez is working with him on his defense. Thoughts are he'll platoon with Tatis. Maybe Jacobs will win the job. This is a hole, but on Opening Day last year we had Schneider. I'm hoping for midseason upgrade here - maybe Dunn, or even Keith if he wants to put the uniform back on. 8. Barajas plays defense, hits homeruns and doesn't get on base much. He can throw folks out, which will be fun. Also, it's looking like Blanco will be Santana's caddy, and I think that can help. Ok, so the seventh and eighth slots are problems. Still, we have reason to expect way more out of this offense than last year, even if there are some injuries. That leaves us with the bullpen... You have to look way back to find Mets team that had great team chemistry. Not that it’s been bad with the recent Mets, but it definitely has not been great. A key component to a winning team, you can’t buy chemistry. As a GM, putting a team together based on skills, stats, and baseball attributes is tough enough. When you add in the layer of evaluating players’ personalities in a quest to create a team that will get along besides playing great baseball, there’s no clear formula to success. GM’s will target players that will help their club, and besides the few troubled players that some teams will stay away from for the fear of bringing in a ‘cancer’ to the locker room a la Milton Bradley, chemistry seems to fall under the radar most often than not when making these major investments. When the Mets picked up ‘Frenchie’ Jeff Francoeur, the last thing that factored into the decision was his personality. As long as he didn’t kill any teammates or coaches in the past, the Mets were bringing him to Queens so they can rid themselves of Church. The Mets never thought anything to the effect of, “this guys great in the clubhouse, lets find a way to get him”. Well what do you know, Frenchie has brought some life to this team. Lets hope it translates to chemistry, which will at least give Mets fans some quality baseball to watch again. The last time I can truly say I saw a Mets tea
 with great team chemistry, you have to look back to the days of Ron Darling, Tim Teufel and co., causing havoc in some honky tonk Texas bar. That was team chemistry at its finest, you just sensed it. Everyone hated them, outside of NY that is, but they had fun, played great together, and had each others backs no matter what. It was also the last time the New York Mets won the championship. Now we haven’t seen any hotfoots out of Frenchie, but he’s becoming a social leader on the team. Along with newcomer, Jason Bay, they set up a viewing party for the U.S. v Canada gold medal hockey game Sunday. According to Frenchie, Mets can expect more social gatherings this year. Our first trip this year is to Colorado, and we have a Monday night off. Guys can go out all day. But we should go out together at night. Let's go have a ball. As a player, these types of things make the clubhouse a more comfortable place to be in and a place they want to play in. Lets give credit where credit is due, Mets received a huge intangible with Frenchie at a low cost. Gold-Medal Chemistry Builder for Mets [MLB] As Spring approaches, I always get optimistic. Now that it looks like, save for the possible addition of a left-handed reliever, the roster is set, I can start to analyze what it is we have at each position. First, lets take a look at what all of sports radio, and every fan I talk to, says needed to be addressed this offseason - starting pitching. Let's look at the projected rotation vs. last year's Spring projection. 2009 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Tim Redding / Livan Herandez 2010 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Jon Niese / Fernando Nieve / Nelson Figueroa et al. What a difference a year makes? One through four are the same, and last year's depth is now this year's unaddressed problem. The common theory goes: "you know you get with Johan (even though he's coming off elbow surgery), but 2, 3 and 4 are all head cases." Pelfrey regressed in an alarming manner, and you have to hope he'll bounce back in some way. In flashes during the 2008 season, he looked like a legitimate no. 2 starter. Ollie P is a head case, but also has been a big game pitcher for the Mets in the past (and still has electric stuff when focused). Perhaps I would have rather signed Randy Wolf to a one-year deal, and no way was Ollie worth three years a $12 million per, but we was coming off two pretty good seasons with the Mets, especially 2007. There was no reason to expect such a miserable 2009, and while many feel he was shut down due to a phony injury, people don't have surgery on phony injuries. John Maine was obviously still hurt, and maybe we don't know what we'll get from him. While that is a lot of uncertainty, short of signing Lackey or dealing for Halladay (neither of which was realistic for the Mets), there isn't much the Mets could do this offseason to fix it. Armes like Marquis and Pineiro don't move me much. Where I might have taken a chance are high-risk, high-reward guys like Sheets, Wang and Bedard. However, Sheets price himself out, and Wang and Bedard may not pitch until deep into the season (without the help of the Mets' crack medical staff). What we hope for here is a few less injuries. Simply getting something close to 180 innings out of each of these guys will be a dramatic improvement over last season, especially because can't help but improve. Tomorrow I'll discuss the projected lineup and the various improvements over last year.
"Morning Near Black Mesa", Oil on Panel, 8x10 inches Jerry Lebo , 2008 Just a quick note to let you know how painting is going in New Mexico. We are having a great time, painting everyday, and traveling around this beautiful State. The above small painting was based on a some photos I took the other day on the way to Bandelier National Monument . To get there you travel by highway through the San Ildefonso and near the San Juan Pueblos. You can see it from miles around as you travel in the area. There is also another Black Mesa in the most Northern part of NM--this one is only about a half our north of Santa Fe. It was early in the day when we passed by, and we stopped on the side of the highway and took some photos--and I made some color notations and a quick sketch. The Mesa actually looks very dark most of the day--but in the early morning it takes on a pinkish/purple quality that was very compelling. I was reminded what a special place New Mexico is the other day by two of my readers. Cindy, who is one of my collectors, sent a comment on my last post--which reminded me of the uniqueness of the New Mexico landscape--and how the skies here are somehow different. In fact, last year when we were here I wrote a post titled " Top Ten Reasons for an Artist to Live in Santa Fe ". I re-read this post and say that the "number one reason" I cited for living in Santa Fe was "clouds". And, I still think the clouds here are the most amazing you will see anywhere. In the morning, the sky here is usually very clear and blue, but when the clouds arrive later in the day, the show is often amazing--and worth the trip alone. I also got a nice note from Jacqueline Butler, welcoming me to New Mexico. Jacqueline is the artistic director for the organization " Daily Painters of New Mexico ". She lives near Galisteo and is thinking about starting a blog and is hosting a workshop for members. So, if you live in the area, drop her a note . Especially if you want to become a daily painter here in NM. I have talked about my own personal views on "daily painting" in previous posts--and I fully support the concept. I just don't think it is for me, personally. My own view is that finding time for "daily painting", is more important than trying to make a painting a day. So there you go. I highly recommend a trip to New Mexico to paint--or just to look around. I have been coming here for thirteen years now--usually once a year. And I am still inspired every time I visit. Who knows, I may even move here one day. I have met many people who come here for business or some other reason--and fall in love and stay. But, even if you can't get here, you can do the next best thing. Go to your studio and find an excuse to put a fantastic sky in one of your landscape paintings! All the best, sixtyminuteartist . "Juniper View (Study)", Jerry Lebo , 2008 Oil on Panel, 6x6 inches You have probably noticed it has been a while since my last post. Several of my regular readers have sent me personal emails asking if something is wrong. I appreciate everyone’s concern, but I am okay—nothing terminal yet. As for the reasons behind my silence, the truth is that I have been dealing with some personal issues--and also have been busy at the day job—including two overseas trips. Fortunately, this has not kept me out of the studio for the most part--and I have been continuing to try to move forward with my work. The important thing is that I am still painting—and keeping my “hour a day” minimum discipline. The main reason I have not been blogging is that I have not really had much to say. I usually need some sort of inspiration or something to share with my readers in order to get me started writing a post. I don't want to bore people with my random thoughts. To be honest, I have also been struggling with which direction to take my art. The last few large "color space" painting I finished are sitting around my studio and pushing me to make another one. But, to tell the truth, I have been feeling like doing some small paintings. I am also torn a bit about how to balance my normally "painterly" style against the more graphic approach of my most recent paintings. I realize now that my “style” is something that took me many years to develop--and I am not sure I should simply throw it out. On the other hand, I still very interested in the ideas I have been pursuing in my recent work. So, why am I posting today? Well, I have a perfect excuse to do some small paintings—and share some ideas with you. We are on vacation in Santa Fe, NM for the next three weeks, and am working with my "portable studio", which is made by Open BoxM . I have written about the traveling setup I use for painting in past posts, and it is ideal for small paintings and studies. So I though I would post a few of these small paintings as they come off the easel over the next few weeks, as well as share some of my tips for painting when traveling. So here is my first travel tip. When traveling, I recommend you try painting on panels—instead of canvas. First, because panels are easy to pack, and you can buy them at most art stores these days. Most airlines are adding baggage charges for weight and second bags these days—and I managed to fit all my clothes and painting supplies for three weeks into one suitcase. You can also make your own panels when you get to your destination from supplies available most places ( I did a post that shows you how ). In fact, unless you are planning to paint big paintings—panels are the way to go in my mind. On the other hand, if you are set on canvas, I have found the best approach is to pack a variety of stretcher bars (taped together) and ship a roll of canvas to where you are painting. That way, you only have to bring the bars, staple gun, and pliers on your flight. If you are bringing large stretcher bars, you are probably not going to be able to fit these in a suitcase, so that means some extra costs. When you stretch your canvas upon arrival ( I did a post on that too ), leave enough edge overlap so as to be able to un -stretch your work. That way you can simply roll it up and take it home in a mailing tube when you leave. Okay, so there is a few tips for painting when traveling. For my current trip I decided to use Ampersand Gessobord . These panels are a bit more expensive than the ones I make at home, but not as expensive as some of the others out there. I started using these in my studio about 8 months back—and I am totally addicted. The surface is so nice and has just the right tooth for taking paint—and the quality and consistency is high. I am not paid to promote their products, but I can recommend them without hesitation . The panels come in various sizes (and you can cut them to size). These are widely available these days, so you have probably seen them at your local art store. So there you go, hope you get a chance to paint outdoors during the summer. And, maybe even get a vacation somewhere so you can paint something new. If so, I will be offering a few tips over the next few weeks—so stay tuned. All the best, sixtyminuteartist . "Sweet Escape", Polymer on Canvas, 50x50 inches Jerry Lebo , 2008 “I don’t paint pictures in hopes that people will understand them. They understand them, or not, according to their own capacity.” -- Pablo Picasso Okay, so I decided to submit a couple of my recent large paintings to a regional juried exhibit up in Fredrick, Maryland . They wanted artists to submit the actual paintings, so it was a bit of a chore framing and then carrying three very large paintings (the largest was 50x60 inches) 30 miles to the venue. Now the good/bad news, I found out that they accepted one of the paintings (the one in my last post, “These five words…”)--but rejected the others, "Sweet Escape" (above), as well as "Dead Heroes", the painting I put up two posts back. You are probably thinking, hey, you should be happy. You got a painting into a juried show, right? Well, it gets better. So I go up on Saturday to pick up the rejected paintings and haul them back to the studio--and when I get to the venue I find out that my artwork has been scattered around. One of the paintings is in a closet—with another painting leaning against it—which put a dent into the canvas. The other one is in an office, leaning against the wall behind a pile of other rejections. But, that wasn't the strangest part of it. The woman handing back the work had the "jury sheet" sitting there and was pleased to show me that the painting accepted into the show had a notation next to it...are you ready....it said, "Maybe, if we have room". There you go--critical acclaim if I have ever heard it! I weakly made the point of saying, well, my paintings are rather large--so I understand if there was limited room (hoping for a bit more a positive response ), to which the woman replied, "Oh, we have paintings in the show bigger than yours." Thud. I tired again on the way out, “So have you given out awards yet.” You can guess the response—“Oh, yes, they are all given out.” So, I am in the show, but barely--and definitely not the rapturous experience one hopes for. Okay, so what is an artist to do in when faced with such a situation? The short answer is brush it off. Get back in the studio as soon as possible and get painting again. I have seen artists send work to many galleries over the years, and most do not even get a polite rejection letter. Getting a form letter can be an achievement. With a juried exhibit, politeness is probably the best you can hope for. Even if you get your work into a group show or a gallery, you can expect that your work will be treated for what it is from a gallery perspective...a commodity—and I have heard of many cases where galleries have damaged work due to haphazard handling. Other artists are your worst enemy, as they tend to treat other artist's work with little regard (if they are not looking). I am serious. If you don't believe me, watch what happens when artists bring their work to a critique or for submission to a juried show--if no one is looking, other artist will not hesitate to move your work or treat it in a very haphazard way. I have seen it. To a gallery, you are just one in a long line of eager artist to get their work shown, so don't be surprised if a gallery generally acts like you're work is replaceable . At least until it sells for $50 grand or so--they tend to get more careful at that point. I think my recent experience also shows some important points to take into account when you think about where and how to send your work out. First and foremost, it is important to find a gallery or event that is interested in work and represents similar artists and/or types of work. I wrote about this early in my blog . But it is worth repeating. If you are painting "cowboys and indians ", don’t send your work to a New York gallery—you won’t garner much interest. However, the good news is that they may be very excited in Tuscon . In the end, you need to decide before sending out work if it is likely to appeal to a certain gallery or jurist. In my case, I think it was the fact that my paintings were so different from all the other painterly and more formal painting that was submitted to the show, that it simply did not fit with the show or what was running through the jurist's mind. You want a show that hangs well together--not necessarily to show every type or style submitted--even I can understand that. Anyway, I thought I would share this experience, so you will be prepared. I know some of you are thinking about trying to break into galleries and submit your work to a show. If you are interested in reading more about how to better showcase your work and build your career as a visual artist, I will again recommend Cay Lang’s book, “Taking the Leap”. I have mentioned it several times in my blog, but it is a great book. I went back to reading it again after my recent experience, and I could quickly see some of the mistake I made in submitting work to the regional exhibit. First of all, as I previously mentioned, these types of modern, hard edge, “color space” paintings don’t really fit the style of the venue or the other art being shown there. So a tepid reception was probably inevitable. Second, I don’t think they together really represent a cohesive artistic statement yet—since they are still evolving in terms of style and technique. This is not to say they are bad paintings, they are perhaps not quite ready for full public exposure or it was not the right venue. Anyway, live and learn. I hope you got something out of my experience that will help you build your career as an artist. All the best, sixtyminutearist . "These Five Words in my Mind" Polymer on Canvas, 60 x 50 inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 “The progression of a painter’s work, as it travels in time from point to point, will be towards clarity: toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, and between the idea and the observer.” --Mark Rothko I though this was a fitting quote for the above painting—and relates back to my own experience lately. As you know, I have making a radical change in my painting style over the last few months, and I have been getting a lot of questions as to “why”? The short answer can be found in the above quote—in that I felt a real need to simplify my work and eliminate the obstacles between what I was trying to say in my paintings—and to send that idea more directly to the observer. The above painting, “These Five Words in my Mind” was motivated by a very simple idea that I had been thinking about for a few months—that is, how do words and colors relate? And could you make a painting that had the effect of words—in terms of evoking a response of the observer? And how could you change the colors and shapes to change the meaning and sensation of a painting? Let me explain. Let’s say you have five words. There are a lot of different things you can say with those five words. Change one word, and you can chance the entire meaning of what you are saying. Take, for example, the two phrases, “I would hate to love you”, and “I would love to hate you”. These phrase contain the same six words—but you immediately feel different depending on which one is said. In a way, color is the same way. You can make a lot of different paintings with a set of five colors—and if you change one color, the entire sensation will also change. Of course, most paintings have dozens or thousands of colors—but do they need all of them? Which ones are important to send the meaning? And which ones will change the meaning of the painting—these are the questions I was asking myself when I thinking about the above painting. For this painting, I purposely chose five colors you would probably never see reflected in water—and except the blue—would not likely make anybody think “water”. Then I tried to make a painting that said “water” on one hand through the subject matter—but in a very minimal way. In fact, the main purpose was to combine five colors into a certain sensation—that is to send a sensation through a certain color “note” or harmony. Also, I used shapes moving from larger to smaller (and hard edge to soft) to give the painting a sense of moving back in space—so that the five colors soon become “color”, “space”, and “sensation” all at the same time-(by combining in your eye)—just like a certain phrase would (or even five music notes) do as they are uttered or played. You cannot hear the individual words or notes—only feel the sensation. I know it probably all sounds pretty crazy—but that is what I was thinking about before I started this painting and while I was painting it—the sensation of five words running around my head. Okay, so how does this relate to the subject of this post? Well, I have been thinking a lot about how paintings communicate and what that means for how artists might approach their paintings. One of the things I think is important is that an artist at least be clear about the motivation for painting before moving to the easel. I have heard instructors say that you must “have one idea” or that you should “focus on the main idea of the painting” while you paint. I have known that to be true based on my own experience. When I start to paint with one idea in mind (say, capturing the feeling of a s
nset) and then start focusing on something else half way through (such as the the color of the mountains)—it is more than likely going to led to a bad painting. The fact is, that a successful paintings are those that deliver a clear message to the observer—as simply as possible. If the artist is not clear—how can he/she expect the observer to see it clearly? So what does this mean for starting a painting? Well, obviously, I think the first step is to make sure you know what you want to say before you start a painting. That is, do you want to say something about something you are seeing, feeling, or something that pleases you visually? Keep that idea in your mind as you plan and work on the painting. Make it as simple as possible. My experience is this simple approach will lead to better outcomes. Successful paintings require a lot of pre-meditation. Many painters and students focus so much on the mechanics of painting—color mixing and drawing—they forget about the “why”. So next time you are about to start a painting. Take a few moments to think about why you have chosen the subject. Ask some hard questions about what attracts you to that subject or landscape. Really work through your motivation for starting a painting—before you start mixing colors and drawing on the canvas—and stick with this idea throughout. Try to get that idea onto the canvas. When you step back from the canvas, ask yourself not if looks like the subject matter—but if it feels like it . Not if the drawing is good, but if the sensation is good. Does the figure feel like it is standing? Not is the gesture correct, but does it feel correct? Why is this important—because when the observer sees your work—this is what he/she will feel right away more than any amount of good drawing or careful color mixing. The idea or message of a painting comes to the viewer in one quick moment as a feeling (like five spoken words)—and so you need to be sure that you are communicating and assessing your paintings at that level. Okay, I know this is a bit touchy feely for some of you. But I hope you got something out if it. All the best, sixtyminuteartist . "Untitled" (Study), Polymer on Paper, 17 1/2 x 23 Inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 The weather is getting better in DC, so I have been able to stroll around during my lunch hour and take a few pictures that I can use as reference material in the studio. I am thankful for my digital camera—not only can I look at the picture right after it is taken—but I can take hundreds of pictures and then simply delete the bad ones. I end up throwing out most of the pictures I take, in any case. In the past, I used to pay to develop a whole roll of film and then throw out the majority of the shots. So I love my digital camera. Anyway, the above study is one of the paintings I am thinking of making into one of the large “color space” paintings that I have been talking about in my blog recently. The study is based on a photo I took last week when I was walking near the Hirshhorn Museum . I like the unusual composition—and thought it would be a good opportunity to explore various color harmonies. I usually do these sorts of painting studies using acrylics and sometimes oils (I gesso the paper for oils). I really struggled with the color relationships in this study and it took me quite a while to figure out how to get the effect I was after. The reference photo and painting are quite different. I have put the reference photo below so you can see the changes I made—basically I re-worked the entire color harmony in pursuit of what I have been talking about recently—that is, how to evoke a certain psychological response in the viewer using color. One of the problems when moving from a small study to a large painting is that a painting that looks good small—may not look good in a larger format. The reverse also holds true, that a large painting may not be very interesting if painted in a smaller format. You have to decide to “go big” or not based on a smaller studies—and it is not always easy to imagine the effect. Anyway, I am thinking of trying the above painting in a large (50x66 inches) format—what do you think? Send me a comment. Okay, so let’s get to the point of this post—which is how to use “color references” in the studio. I have increasingly found that I am nearly blind when it comes to color. I know that sounds strange—but the light in my studio is always changing, my mood changes, and even my sight seems to change when I am in the studio. I look at a color at one moment—and it looks greenish—and then two minutes later it looks to have change to a bluish color. I have written about this in some previous posts—but I think color is the hardest part of being an artist. It is such a moving target—even for a trained artist. One solution I have come to increasingly rely on is the uses of color reference materials. That is, pieces of color that I have lying around my studio—that can serve as a neutral reference point. For example, in just moving from the easel to the palette—sometimes my thoughts about a color change. I might think I have the right color when I am mixing it on the palette—and then get to the canvas and change my mind. So which color is right? The one I was seeing on the palette or the one I have on my brush? It depends, of course, on what color I was after. Which I might have forgotten by the time I am ready to make the stroke—since I am daydreaming about something else most of the time anyway! Color references don’t need to be expensive or complicated. They can be pieces of paper you paint yourself—or colored paper that you buy. You can use a color matching system—such as Pantone—or make up your own system. Color charts are also a popular way of color referencing—and can be keyed back to the paints you are using. Basically, what you want from a color referencing system is something that you can refer to that is unchanging! Examples of color references that I have used in my own studio include PMS swatches , color-aid paper , and premixed color charts . The key to using a color reference is to understand what it can—and can’t do. A color reference is not a solution to a problem. It is not a preset color harmony that you can use in a painting (I don’t think this is possible anyway). The benefits of a color reference system in my mind are two. First, it is a tool you can use to work out how colors (and values) will affect each other before you put them onto the canvas. In some ways, this can lead to new color harmonies—but in my experience it can also keep you from mixing the wrong colors or going in circles. Second, and in my mind equally important, color references can be used to bridge the gap between the color you are seeing in your mind and the one you are mixing on the palette. For example, when you think “blue”— what blue are you thinking about . If you can pick out the “blue” you want from a color reference system before you start mixing—then you can more quickly know if you mixed the right color. If you are not convinced yet—try this experiment. Think about a color you want to use in your paintings. Say, a sky color—or the color of the grass on a sunny day. Next time you are in the studio—try to mix it. Or, better yet, look out the window and mix it based on what you are seeing. Once you have mixed the color, put it aside for the moment. Next, find a piece of paper or other reference material that is as close as possible to the color you are after. You can again compare it directly (by holding it up to the window, for example). Now, mix the color again but with the reference color sitting on your palette. Now go back and compare the color you mixed when you did not have the reference—and the one you mixed when you had the reference nearby. Which is closer to the color you were after? I think you will see my point pretty quickly. Having a neutral reference can get you closer to where you are going--and faster. I am a strong believer in having as much information around you as possible when you are in the studio. Photos are an accepted material for artists to use. But this is only one form of information— and not a very good one at that ! I also am a firm believer in color references. There are numerous ways to use these to improve you paintings—color mixing only being one. Okay, that’s it for now. Go to the studio and paint. All the best, sixtyminuteartist . "Dead Heroes", Polymer on Canvas, 47 x 66 inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 I have been busy over the last few weeks working on several large paintings, which has proven to be a big challenge. The above painting is the first to come off the easel, and is about as big as I can effectively paint in my basement studio. Here is a shot of what it looked like on the easel, to give you an idea of the scale. As you can see, I am continuing to pursue the approach I started in the painting of our dog I showed you in my last post. The intent is to push the color harmony ideas I have been talking about over the last few months. That is, to bring together the color interactions in such a way as to make a psychological “color space” which is integral to the subject and message of the painting--and transforms the viewer's experience. The painting itself is based on a photo I took this summer at the World War II memorial here in DC. I made a photo album for my Great Uncle who recently died—as he was too ill to travel to see the Memorial himself. The picture is of one of the waterfalls that they have at each end of the memorial (one each for the Atlantic and Pacific Campaigns)—this one being the Pacific. My Great Uncle was in the Pacific during WWII—and survived the sinking of his ship and his shipmates being eaten by sharks. I have fond memories of how he used to tell me war stories. He is one of the big influences of my youth—always around during the summers I spent in Indiana as a kid. He died a couple of months back after a long battle with prostate cancer. I will miss him--and I suppose the painting is a bit of a memorial to his memory. Okay, so back to the subject of the post—painting shadows. This post has been lurking in my mind for a couple of weeks--and is motivated by one of the key issues I see people struggling with in their paintings. Often we stand back from the easel--and wonder what is wrong with a painting and think "color". But, which color? Most of the time we look at the higher value and high chroma hues and start messing around with those--but in fact it may be the shadows that are the problem. Frankly, I see this over and over in my students work--they pay a lot of attention to the colors where the light is hitting an object or the landscape--but then mix up some pretty boring, or even plain bad, shadow colors. The first message I want to get across is: shadows are colors! Let me say it again another way: the color you are putting in the shadow is just as important as the color you are putting on the highlight. If either one is wrong--the painting will suffer. Okay, so how do you find the right shadow color? Well, first, you need to be able to see the shadow color. So let me give you a little exercise that I have learned that will help developed your mind and eyes to better see shadow colors. If you do this exercise regularly, it will improve your painting. I promise. It is a little exercise I call, "find the shadow color". The exercise starts by finding a piece of paper that is a single color and at least around four or five inches square in size. It doesn't matter where it comes from--out of a magazine, book cover, or simply paint a piece of paper. Next, take the piece of paper and put it a few feet away from you in a location where it is being hit by light. It can be natural light coming in from a window (if you are in the studio)--or light from a lamp. Doesn't matter. Once you have your color/paper sitting there, take a moment to really notice the color. Take a long look--try to remember what it looks like. Is it warm or cool? What is the hue? Try to memorize the color. Next, take the same piece of paper and put it somewhere nearby where it is not being hit by light--but the color is still observable (not in the closet!). For example, if you had the paper sitting on a table, put it on the floor next to the table in the shadow of a table. If it was in the light coming in a window, put it in a place where the light is not directly hitting it. Notice the change in color. Take a long look--try to remember what the new color looks like--how did it change when you moved it out of the light? Did it get warmer or cooler? What is the hue? Again, try to memorize the color--and think about how it compares to the color when it was lighted. Move it back and forth between light and shadow and notice what happens. Okay, now the fun part. Go and find another piece of paper (or paint one) that is the color of the paper when it is not being hit by light. This is a lot harder than it sounds. I did this in my office the other day and it took me a good fifteen minutes to find two objects where the color of one was the shadow color of the other. The test that you have the right color is simple. Put the two pieces of paper in light together, then move the original piece (the one you first chose and observed in light) into the shadow. If you have the right shadow color, the two pieces of paper should appear to be the same color. Below are some pictures to give you a better idea of how this works. The first photo below is of the two pieces of paper that I determined were shadow and highlight colors. They are actually the covers of two publications I had sitting around my office. This is how they look sitting on my desk as lighted by the lighting in my office. So, how do I know that the darker color is the shadow color of the lighter one? Simple, I put the lighter color on the floor off the edge of my desk so that I could see them next to the other. In effect, so that the darker one was in the light, but the lighter one was in shadow. Below is a photo of the result--taken with the darker one sitting on the desk and the lighter one on the floor in shadow. You can see that they have effectively become the same color. And, yes, the one on the floor is the lighter color in the above photo. Hard to believe I know. Try this exercise in various lighting conditions and types of light. Finding two colors that work may be a bit of a struggle at first, but you will get better at it. If you do it as a regular exercise, you may be surprised how it improves your ability to paint shadow colors (the first thing you will notice is that shadows are colors--and they have predictable relationships!). Your mind will remember how colors in shadow and light relate--which will make you quicker at finding the right shadow color. There are a lot of variations on this exercise that can help you out in the studio. For example, say I was painting a still life with an object in it that I was having a hard time finding the right (or even simply believable) shadow color. A simple guide might be to paint a piece of paper the color I was using for the object in light, and another piece the shadow color I was using. Then I could do the same as I did above to compare the shadow color to othe other paper "in shadow"--and if the relationship was correct. Even if the match was not perfect, I would expect the temperature and general hue would be in the same range. If the two colors are off--you will see it pretty quickly--trust me. One of the things you will notice right away is that the shadow color of something in natural light is much cooler that a shadow of the same object indoors under normal house lighting. Which means, for example, that the relationships indoors are different than those you would see if you did the same exercise (with the same colors) outdoors. Which means that if you are painting landscapes, use natural lighting for the exercise--and preferably do it outdoors. Also, the shadow color of an object will vary with the distance you are away from it. So, if you move one of the pieces of paper closer or farther away from you--the relationships change. So, think of it as a way to train your eyes and guide your thinking--not a scientific experiment. So there you go. A simple exercise to help you explore shadow colors--and to get
This morning, artist/sculptor Mike Kraus sent me images of the clay mold he has recently completed of the sword that will soon be replaced on the General James Nagle statue. Simply stated, I am blown away by the level of detail. Indeed, this is an exact rendering of the sword Nagle was presented following his return from the Mexican-American War and of the bronze sword that was originally placed on the monument in 1904. I think you will agree with me that this is superb, stellar work. I certainly could not be happier. The next step is the bronzing!
There's been a lot of talk recently about this brrreeeport thing... Traffic has been slow to NFK ever since the pixels fad died down but let's see if this does anything to bring more people to the blog! -Steve- We got a nice mention in the Wall Street Journal today. Alex Tew is auctioning off the last 1000 pixels of the Million Dollar Homepage and the author mentioned some of the other pixel sites. If you would like to support the cause, please donate as little as $5 to help. -Steve- Bidders Vie to Purchase Last Web-Screen Sections; Copycat Sites Now Abound January 10, 2006; Page B8 In late November, this column talked about Alex Tew, a 21-year-old British man who, in a quest to fund his university studies, had arrived at the seemingly outlandish idea of creating a Web site and selling advertising in the form of "pixels" -- the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen -- for a buck each. His goal: one million dollars. What made the story noteworthy then was that Mr. Tew had already passed the halfway mark despite having no target audience or even the slightest bit of brand recognition. As of tomorrow, Mr. Tew could not only reach his million-dollar goal, he could surpass it by auctioning off the last 1,000 pixels for www.milliondollarhomepage.com on eBay. Further, Mr. Tew's business model has inspired hundreds, perhaps thousands, of copycat sites angling to find a new twist on pixel sales for whatever their needs may be. Alex Tew, creator of milliondollarhomepage.com, and his father, Malcolm Tew, pictured the weekend before Alex's last pixels are auctioned on eBay. As an entrepreneurial venture, Mr. Tew's stands out given his young age, global influence and quick return on an estimated $40,000 investment to host and publicize the site. On Aug. 26, Mr. Tew launched his home page and divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. He sold pixels for $1 each, with a minimum order of 100 pixels and promised to keep the page alive for at least five years. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing, linking it to their own site. Today the home page resembles a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors. Internet Celebrity Meantime, Mr. Tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the Internet community. World-wide solicitations have swamped his email in-box; he says there are currently 10,000-plus unanswered messages soliciting him for everything from money and business advice to job positions. Getty Images, which provides film and photo images to media outlets and others, just conducted a portrait session with Mr. Tew and his parents in Cricklade, England. In fact, all the attention has persuaded Mr. Tew to postpone his university studies -- an ironic turn of events given that school was the original impetus for his project. "I never expected the site to reach the level of success it has done," he writes in an email. "But I can't see how I can realistically continue my studies in the immediate future -- due to the sheer scale of interest in my site, and all the new opportunities that have presented themselves as a result. There just isn't time now." He says he will return to school in September. By the end of 2005, Mr. Tew had sold 999,000 pixels and demand outstripped supply for the last thousand. On Dec. 30, the page had one million unique visitors and Mr. Tew's server almost died, he says, forcing him to temporarily suspend order taking. Giddy prospective buyers pushed him to open a second page, but Mr. Tew had pledged to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached in order to protect its originality. Final Auction So over the New Year, Mr. Tew decided to do what any calculating businessman might: He put the last 1,000 pixels up for sale on eBay. The auction ends tomorrow at 1:42 p.m. EST; as of 6 p.m. last night, the highest offer from a pool of bidders handpicked by Mr. Tew was $160,109.09. He expects to net about $650,000 to $700,000 after costs, taxes and a donation he plans to give to The Prince's Trust, a U.K. charity for youth that once helped him. Mr. Tew's efforts benefited from newness, shrewd marketing and the Internet's lightning-speed word of mouth. After first persuading his friends and family to buy pixels to make the page seem legitimate, he then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who directed traffic Mr. Tew's way. The media in Britain picked up on his venture, fueling more visitors. In mid-September, Mr. Tew's Web site landed on the "Movers & Shakers" feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world's Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point Mr. Tew's site reached Alexa's No. 2 spot. That brought in a new wave of advertisers. In October, a U.S. publicist named Imal Wagner contacted him about penning his life story; he declined but hired her to help him with a U.S. media tour. Pixel Mania The attention inspired rival sites. One attractive 22-year-old Siberian emergency worker has posted her own black-and-white photo on a home page; as people buy pixels on www.presentmecolor.com the image metamorphoses to color. At www.boxofstars.com two filmmakers are selling digital "stars" -- orbs of light of various hues and size that bounce about the home page and link to other sites -- to raise $50,000 and finance their picture. In a marriage of online and outdoor advertising, www.stickermyhummer.com encourages buyers to purchase ads on an online picture of the body of a Hummer H2; when that's filled the site's owner, a California State University student promises he'll buy a real one and wrap it in a graphical composite of the ads. There are charity sites, sites devoted to erotica, and plain-vanilla financial Web sites all using pixels to raise funds. An Indiana University student has even launched a parody site called www.trumpingalex.com , complete with a fake image of Mr. Tew sporting Donald Trump-esque hair. While none of these seem to have replicated Mr. Tew's success, and it's unclear if they ever will, the sheer volume of attempts and creative juice behind them paints an interesting picture of collective online entrepreneurship around the globe. And at the very least, it suggests there will be an eventual shakeout of what works, and what doesn't. For instance, one site, www.worldofpersia.com , targets a single ethnic group and purports to have sold 1,900 pixels in two days. Two Carnegie Mellon students started www.nickelsforkatrina.org to raise money for hurricane victims. Meantime, people are tweaking their pages' graphical elements to stand out: A Frenchman launched www.monpremiermillion.com where people place ads on a map of his homeland and www.yournameonthemoon.com solicits people to post missives on a lunar image. Currently, Mr. Tew is holed up at home in Cricklade with his mom and dad, monitoring his auction on a 17-inch Hewlett-Packard laptop from his parents' living room and sleeping from 5 a.m. till 9 a.m. to keep up with U.S. time zones. His folks screen his calls -- their son's numbers got posted on the Internet -- and siblings helped sort through the last round of orders. Mr. Tew says he paid them. Says his 58-year-old dad, Malcolm Tew: "Alexander has always had lots and lots of ideas, some good and some not so good. This is certainly the most, ah, fruitful." Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com We got written up today in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05329/611718.stm Sorry for the sparse posting. The last couple weeks at school have been pretty busy and we haven't had much time to work on the site. Our official count is up to $2,555 and we're trying to drive some more traffic in the coming weeks. The group I went to Mississippi with is following up with the people we helped out and we will be presenting a report on our trip to the university. I will have an update on this in a week or so. There was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today about the pixels phenomenon. Unfortunately, they didn't mention us but it sheds some light on the wave of interest around such an arbitrary thing. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB113261806930503580.html?mod=technology_main_promo_right Pipe Dream How Selling Pixels May Yield a Million Bucks November 22, 2005; Page B1 It was just a few months ago that 21-year-old Alex Tew of Great Britain was stumped about how to pay for college. He'd filled a notebook with ideas before jotting down this simple, if rather audacious, query to himself: How Can I Become a Millionaire? In the annals of entrepreneurship, what followed is an instructional tale of how a brainstorm, coupled with the Internet's powerful word-of-mouth culture, can set a trend in motion with lightning speed. Mr. Tew says his strategy was to find an idea simple to understand and cheap to set up, with a catchy name that would garner attention online, where he gained experience from having free-lanced as a Web designer for a few years. Ultimately, his solution amounted to making money via Internet advertising -- but with a twist. Instead of selling banner ads, text links or splashy videolike ads that fill a screen, Mr. Tew opted to hawk the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen: the pixel. A pixel is a tiny dot of light and color, and each screen has tens of thousands of them. Mr. Tew created a home page, www.milliondollarhomepage.com , where he divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. His plan: to sell the pixels for $1 a piece, with a minimum order of 100 pixels. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing that links to their own site when clicked on. The end result is a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors all amassed on a single digital billboard. (Mr. Tew doesn't charge his advertisers anything when a visitor clicks on the ads.) Mr. Tew pledged to keep the site up for at least five years and to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached. "I had to think big," he says. The notion seemed absurd. Who would want to advertise on an unknown site that had no target audience, no track record of attracting visitors or even the slightest brand recognition? But as with many gimmicks, its newness gave it legs, as did Mr. Tew's shrewd marketing. He first roped his friends and family into buying pixels and placing ads to make the page seem legitimate. He then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who wrote about his crazy idea and linked to the site, which directed traffic his way. The media in Britain picked up on his efforts, fueling more visitors. Within two weeks of the site's Aug. 26 launch Mr. Tew says he sold $40,000 in ads. More important, the traffic numbers started gaining attention among the U.S. Internet community. Since its launch, the site has received a total of about 1.5 million unique visitors. In mid-September, it landed on the "Movers & Shakers" feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world's Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what's hot and what's not, and at one point Mr. Tew's site reached Alexa's No. 2 spot. Currently, the site gets 600,000 to 700,000 unique visitors a month. As of yesterday evening, Mr. Tew said he was $623,800 toward his goal, more than enough to pay for college and earmark some cash for his next entrepreneurial venture, he says. (He keeps a running tally of his sales on the Web site, and though the figure can't be independently verified, screenshots emailed by Mr. Tew of his PayPal and other checkout accounts appear to support his claim.) While there's also no way of knowing for sure whether Mr. Tew is the first entrepreneur to sell pixels, the idea was new enough that it felt that way to onlookers. "I was like, 'What's this?' " says Daniel Khesin, vice president of marketing at DS Laboratories Inc., a skin-care company in Lake Success, N.Y. After examining Mr. Tew's site, he says: "There was nothing inherently special about the page, but it was very obvious to us that at the very least, buying some pixels would be a good idea for the sheer number of visitors he was getting." DS Laboratories purchased 800 pixels. Almost overnight, he says, traffic surged at the company's Web site by twentyfold, and all of the increase came from milliondollarhomepage.com. More impressive, he says, sales by Internet companies that DS Laboratories' site links to jumped almost 50% within a week of the ad going up. "Our skepticism was that this is untargeted traffic," Mr. Khesin says. "But this advertising has definitely paid for itself many times forward. And unlike banner advertising where it goes away, people will always know where to find it to go back and purchase more products." Similarly, Chris Magras, president Evisions Marketing Inc. in Tempe, Ariz., which helps Web sites get higher rankings on search services, also noted milliondollarhomepage.com's movement on Alexa.com. "Some people would say it's a bad idea, some would say it's a good one. All I know is that it was generating interest," Mr. Magras says. Evisions bought 6,400 pixels and its ad went up on a Friday. The following Monday morning, Evisions was getting 2,000 more unique visitors to its home page, all linked directly from milliondollarhomepage.com. The number of leads, or visitors filling out personal information on the Evisions site, jumped to 300 a day from 100. "It was quality traffic," Mr. Magras says. "It was definitely the biggest payoff for a one-stop ad buy we've ever had." He adds that the company is still getting 800 to 1,000 new visitors daily from Mr. Tew's site. Copycats popped up almost immediately; now there are hundreds of Web sites selling pixels, some of them directly crediting Mr. Tew -- and even linking to his site. Some advertisers have put out press releases touting their alliances with Mr. Tew's site, further helping spike his traffic. The risk, of course, is that as the original pixel concept gets mimicked, it will suffer from brand dilution and become a less compelling a business model. What's more, as milliondollarhomepage.com has filled up, it's become harder for advertisers to stand out amid a busy screen with messages ranging from "CasinoScams" and "Free Ringtones" to "Jesus" and "Hypnosis"; the smallest ad spaces, at 100-pixels square, are nearly indecipherable at this point. Whether Mr. Tew reaches a million dollars remains to be seen. He readily notes that he'd never do another site like the original. Now, he says, "the copycats are all competing with each other." One is Moneypants.com , a personal finance Web site geared toward women that says it has 600 members and has collected $4,500 over the last few weeks from its own pixel "Dream Page" -- a decent chunk of change for a nascent enterprise. "It's very compelling," says MoneyPants Chief Executive Komal Bhojwani. "We don't have to end up going the investor route, which might require us to make changes to the business that we don't want to make. And we didn't have to get into debt by borrowing from a bank. We are generating revenue and not expenses." One advertiser, Cherryl Weaver, says she's seen a 13% jump in traffic to her real estate Web site, www.hotlaneighborhoods.com , from the 1,500 MoneyPants.com pixels she bought. "As long as it's a strategic alliance, it makes sense," Ms. Weaver says, alluding to the affinity between a personal-finance site and real estate. "Would I team up with McDonald's if they did a dream page? No." Meantime, James Thomson, a Web designer in Branson, Mo., says he's wiped out $30,000 in personal debt accumulated after the dot-come bust with his site, www.millionpennyhomepage.com , by selling pixels by the penny, instead of the dollar. Yesterday, he had only $974 left to go before reaching his goal of $10,000. And Christian Abad, president of Accessible Computing Inc. in Charlotte, N.C., is trying to lure new clients to his pixel page, called www.pixelads4all.com , by giving them a 50% discount off their pixel purchases. Sales have been slow, but he remains optimistic about the overall concept and has even purchased 11 domain names in anticipation of a futu
e in pixel advertising. Among them: pixelads4shopping.com and pixelads4porn.com. For his part, Mr. Tew says he wants to keep milliondollarhomepage.com online "forever." If and when a million pixels are sold, he says he'll leave the page frozen in time, no changes allowed, no new buyers permitted. His ultimate goal is as lofty as the original concept: He hopes his site will be like a time capsule showing "what's possible on the Internet" -- an iconic image that he imagines "one day might be a piece of art in a museum." Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com This week was a pretty positive week for us. Getting listed on the Blogs of Note was great for our traffic and we've been logging about 300 uniques per day to the main site. We've broken $2275 and we should have it all updated by tonight. Few ideas being tossed around right now...One of them brought to our attention has been broadening the scope of where we put our donations. Although Katrina needs financial help, there are other natural disasters occuring in the US and around the world. All of the money would still got the Red Cross, but we would donate it into different hurricane reliefs such as Wilma, Rita and the Earthquakes in Pakistan. Please post some comments in the forums and let us know what you think. Any name change ideas? Thank you to everyone who has been buying up pixels. Your support is appreciated. We've been getting some interesting donors from sites such as Save The Ta-Tas and Doombuggies . Wouldn't it be funny if someone bought up pixels to propose...like on the megatron at a baseball game? -Steve and Keith- For the final leg of our time in Mississippi we were supposed to be working on projects further south, towards New Orleans. Because of how day-to-day things happen, however, these projects were unable to happen. On our way back I got some pictures of the damage that is still evident in the area. The golden arches - just about all of the street signs were blown out like this. It is shocking to see miles of commercial areas with businesses that still have not fully recovered from the disaster. We passed by a CVS that was operating out of a trailer. It is amazing that when people need something like medicine, quick and dirty solutions are thrown up to fill that need. The weekend spent in Mississippi was a great experience. In the short time that we were there, we were able to make an impact. Although not all of the projects we lined up happened as planned, just being able to help others in need made the trip worth it. A student group on campus, Alternative Break will be making a follow-up trip to the region in the beginning of January. On a side note, none of the money for this trip came out of NickelsForKatrina.org . This was a trip organized by the Division of Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University. With the generous help of Shernell Smith and Rowshawn Palmer, we were able to get it together on such short notice. Thank you to everyone who has been reading, commenting, donating and putting up our banner. Your support is appreciated. -Steve and Keith- Free Cellphones for Katrina Victims : "The FCC has approved a plan by the feds to give all Katrina evacuees free cellphones with 300 minutes of talk time. Now I'm sure they're not handing out pink RAZRs to those in need so it's not an issue of logistics. So when did Katrina happen? Oh right, almost 2 months ago. I'm sure if someone needed a cellphone, they'd have it by now. What about people affected by more recent hurricanes like Wilma? There's trouble in paradise down in Floridia and I'm sure they could use those hot Cingular and Tracfone phones right about now. Anyway, enough kvetching. The offer is open to every household approved for housing assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the FCC. Give 'em a call if you need something... oh. That's right. Just hit the web... oh. Poop. Feds give out free phones to Katrina evacuees [Textually]" We got some more donations to the site yesterday. One that we thought was particularly interesting is another non-profit: Save The Ta-Tas . They sell clever T-Shirts to benefit breast cancer. Their link is in the upper left hand corner of the site .

Yesterday, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 sang the national anthem at The New York Rangers game in Madison Square Garden ! The kids brought the crowd to an incredible roar of thunderous applause, as can be seen in the video below! What an afternoon!! The usher outside our suite where we watched the game said in his 20 years working at MSG, he would place our rendition of the anthem in the Top 5 versions that he's heard! And Greg , our contact from the Rangers camp, e-mailed and said, "Believe me – I work every home game and tonight was the loudest applause I have ever heard at the Garden for an anthem. I truly hope we can make this an annual tradition. To top it off, you guys brought us luck during a team slump, as the Rangers got a big win!" AWESOME!! After their incredible performance of the anthem, all the kids were ushered to 3 VIP suites, where they got to watch the game! While there, they were visited by former Rangers, Gilles Villemure & Pete Stemkowski , who signed autographs and spoke with the kids! Not only that, we ran into America's Next Top Model contestant, April Wilkner , who now works for MSG as a TV correspondent. She was as cool as can be, and a great sport, letting Ethan get in some more celebrity sniffing! During a TV break during the second period of the game, they showed the video filmed by our new friend Faith that we filmed at school the other day of " Empire State Of Mind ," which was spliced with highlights from the season! It was so great hearing the kids and seeing them on the jumbo-tron! The kids all got hot dogs, chips, soda, balloons, and programs courtesy of the Rangers! Thanks to the team, Greg, & Faith, for all their incredible hospitality and for a day the PS22 Chorus will not soon forget! And thanks to Ms. Lisa, Mrs. Johnson, Ms. Laurie, & Ms. Massimo , for capturing the day for us with all the great pics and video footage!! This week, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 is on fire! Starting it off with a viral smash of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix , the kids have brought in a whole new bunch of fans from not only the States, but from countries like France, Brazil, Germany,and more! The chorus earned 2 Top 10 YouTube honors for the week and a whole slew of others, while making its homepage the #7 Most Viewed Music Channel this week! (That places it even higher than Beyonce's channel which currently weighs in at #13! Craziness!!) Also this week, the chorus was invited to perform and make its plea for the arts at the District 31 IDEAL parent forum, which you can see in the video at the top of the post. We thank long-time friend of the chorus, Joan McKeever Thomas (see pic below), for this wonderful opportunity to invest in the future of our chorus children's arts education. The kids did us proud as always, and we hope that in sharing both their talent and their story, we made an impact. So how can PS22 top a week like this? Well get ready, because we're going to give it the ol' elementary school try! Indeed there's lots more excitement on the way! On Sunday afternoon, the kids will be appearing at Madison Square Garden , where they will be singing the national anthem at the New York Rangers game! Earlier this week, we got a visit from Greg &amp; Faith representing the team, who shot footage of the kids singing their version of " Empire State of Mind Pt. XXII " that will be played at the game alongside highlights of the season. Unfortunately, that video will not be able to be broadcast, but the MSG Network is supposed to be airing the kids' singing of the anthem, though it may be later on in the game during an intermission. Exciting stuff!! Puck drop is at 3:00 PM EST so set those TIVOS &amp; DVRs! Then on Tuesday, prepare for yet another brilliant PS22 Chorus collaboration! The kids will be joining reggae artist Matisyahu on stage at the 92nd Street Y in N.Y.C.!! They'll be performing their version of Matisyahu's "One Day" with the man himself! You may recall "One Day" was the official song of this year's Winter Olympics, and a great song it is! According to our sources, the show is nearly sold out, and the show will be airing live to 17 different cities in Hillels and JCCs across the country. PS22 will also be hosting a visit from Matis to rehearse (a la our unforgettable Celtic Woman collaboration ), so this should prove to be yet another rewarding week for our blog followers! To follow the PS22 Chorus blog and be alerted to all the new goings-on and music, click here . PS22 Chorus member Fiona wrote this sweet and somber song she ironically calls " Friendship ." I found it very touching when she sang it for me, and decided to work with her to arrange it for the full chorus. Here is the beautiful result. Congratulations to Fiona for her superb song and performance here in the video. Already internet fans are comparing her to a young Avril Lavigne ! Love it!! We're so proud of you, Fiona!! What a great example you are to show how to turn painful emotions into something beautiful. UPDATE (3-13-10): CONGRATS TO FIONA!! She earned a YouTube Honor with her original song as the #68 Top Rated Music Video today!! Check out the screencap below! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 made the cover of CHORAL DIRECTOR MAGAZINE ! The magazine includes a very in-depth article/interview with writer Eliahu Sussman , and features some excellent photos from Claudio Papapietro . Unfortunately the on-line version doesn't include all the great photos of the kids that were used in the hard copy version, but the complete article is available on Choral Director Magazine's website . (The magazine was apparently published back in November, but it just came to my attention the other day!) Awesome to discover that PS22 Chorus of 2010 is currently being featured on the home page of Billboard.com on as their featured viral video! Below is a screen cap of their home page, and a cap to the link to the vid and short article praising the kids' new version of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix ! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 is definitely causing quite a stir around the internet with its newest cover of "Lisztomania" by Phoenix . In addition to earning over 50,000 views on its weekend debut and being featured in top spots on Buzzfeed & Reddit , today the video has shown up on three noteworthy blogs from The Village Voice, Teen Vogue, & MTV Buzzworthy ! All have great things to say about the chorus's latest effort! Check out the screencaps below. And for more on "Lisztomania," click here . The chorus just got another e-mailed message from Lynn Hillary of Celtic Woman , who visited the kids just last week . Dear Gregg and PS22, It's been almost a week since we met you and your incredible bunch of little superstars but we are all STILL talking about it all the time! I can't stress enough what an impression they made on us not just with their glorious voices and obvious love and dedication for the music they sing, but they were just such nice friendly kids!! I just know they will all go on to do great things in the world. Sometimes I forget what joy there is to be found in singing, and you all reminded me of that! Also your advice to the kids about "if you FEEL the music you can never go wrong!" is something I will always think about if I ever feel nervous! I've been reading your amazing blog and really wanted to add my thanks too (you don't have to post this up, I'm sure you're running out of space! I just wanted to thank you again, I know it's all been said already but once more wouldn't hurt!!) I was on the meet and greet that night at Radio City and the people were amazed when I told them this was our first time performing with the children, they said it looked so natural, like it was really meant to be a part of the show all the time. If only you could be with us every night! Performing You Raise Me Up now feels strange without PS22, like there is something missing, but their voices always resonate inside my head as we sing, so in a way it feels like they are there all around us, sometimes I imagine that they are! I think this is an experience that will stay with me for a long long time. Thank you so much and please tell them that we really miss them and think about them a lot! I wish you and the children continued success and happiness, and we really hope to see you again soon (for more hugs..and sniffs!) I can't wait to see what you get up to next on your adventures...we'll be watching!! Peace and Love, Lynn
Don't Call It A Comeback : Surprisingly enough I actually had a pretty good day today. I managed to stop by school and get some work done and I got to hang out with a lot of people (read: girls ) I haven't seen in ages. I plan on doing the same tomorrow and Friday in an attempt to finally get cracking on the thesis, which has been bringing me down for ages. After dinner and having worked on my Movable Type site, which I'm hoping will be ready this weekend (plus a couple of blog entries I've been working on), I wen't down the pub to see the Arsenal - Roma game. Honestly, I had decided not to get my hopes up, because of last five games Arsenal has played and their reputation for not being strong in away games in Europe. And it was my impression that Oleg "The Ox" Luzhny was out with an injury leaving a spot open in defense for some German kid. So when Roma scored within four minutes that didn't exactly help with my confidence, either. But Thierry Henry showed everyone why he makes the big bucks and scored on literally every shot he had on goal to make it an incredible 3-1 win. I watched the game with my brother , who's a real Arsenal fan, and a bunch of Roma supporters, so the win was extra sweet. It was difficult not to gloat, but seeing as the ref wasn't exactly friendly towards the Italian side we tried to keep namecalling and insults to a minimum. I was watching CSI last night. I have this thing about watching television series from the beginning and for some reason I can't start watching a series from episode three or five. So when CSI was first show here and I didn't have the channel at first, I just gave up on it. But seeing as it has just started from episode one again on a channel I have now I've started watching it and already after two episodes I'm pretty hooked. It's very different from other shows and I like the cast a lot more than I thought I would. So now that all the other shows I follow will probably take a long Christmas vacation it's nice to know that there'll still be at least one cool show on. The other show that I follow religiously right now is The West Wing . We' re about a season behind the American schedule, so they've just introduced Mary-Louise Parker here. I'd forgotten how cute she is. I saw her recently in the mushy, but watchable Cupid & Cate where she wears a lot of black eye make-up, and she looks just as fantastic on The West Wing . And everything that I've liked about the show so far is still just as good or better in this third season, so I'm still totally hooked. Send Lawyers, Guns And Money. The Shit Has Hit The Fan : I feel like my head is about to explode. I've just had the worst weekend in ages and it's spilling heavily over into this week. I've been getting letters about my taxes and other depressing money situations and although a week ago I was sure that all this was way behind me everything has just been opened up again and now it's even worse than originally expected. Since Saturday morning I've felt like picking up a Louisville Slugger and beating the shit out of somebody, but I don't have a baseball bat, so I've been forced to sit around and curse, mumble incoherently, and bitch, which I've been doing. A lot. It's really frustrating to be completely powerless and just seeing everything fall apart like a fucking house of cards. So I haven't really been in the mood to blog about my excellent trip to Copenhagen and the fantastic concerts I went to. But as soon as I get my hands on some Prozac I'll be on it like the paparazzi on J-Lo's ass. The only good news right now is that I've been reading We Blog and this humble weblog is mentioned in it. Kinda. If you look on page 13 and 14 there are screen dumps illustrating how you set up a Blogger account. And if you look on the left side you'll notice that under Blogs of Note it says: There Is Nothing To Not Be Amazed At . So it seems that my 15 minutes have stretched on to a link to my site accidentally being visable in a book. How very exciting! Don't Be Real, Be Postmodern : Nothing much going on here right now. In about an hour I'll be on my way for a three day stay in Copenhagen. I'll go see Ryan Adams and Jesse Malin tonight and Coldplay and Idlewild tomorrow, both of which I'm really looking forward to. I've been listening to Idlewild all day and they're actually really good, so it should be awesome to see them live. Also tomorrow Denmark are playing Poland tonight and the news story is that Morten Olsen, the head coach, would like to see our wings score some goals. Turns out Ebbe Sand (of Schalke 04) and Jon Dahl Tomasson (of AC Milan) has scored something like 75% of the Danish goals, so now that Martin Jørgensen has started scoring in Udinese and Dennis Rommedahl has scored for PSV Eindhoven he like to see them do the same for the national squad. Well, wouldn't we all? I finished fixing the headers on my Moveable Type template last night. I had to open 176 individual postings and add a new header and delete the old, which is about as tedious as it gets. But now it's done, so hopefully I'll be able to fix the rest of the problems this week and launch the new version next week. Chances are it'll look almost exactly like the current site, but hopefully it'll load a lot faster. I'm pretty nuts about bands, who make 80s inspired music and wear 80s inspired clothes. The latest to blow me away is Swedish band Melody Club . Their single Palace Station is the best retro single since Emerge by Fischerspooner , so you should definitely check it out. I Was Dressed For Success, But Success It Never Comes : I’ve been a little busy lately, so I haven’t gotten around to talking about the Supergrass show I went to last week. It wasn’t as good as the first time I saw them, but the last half hour of the show was pretty great. If you haven’t seen Supergrass live they basically consist of Dr. Zaius, Paul McCartney's younger brother and that chubby kid you were best friends with in the 3rd grade. And yet somehow they’ve managed to put together some really cool songs for their four albums. Unfortunately, they played way too many songs from their latest album, so it wasn’t until towards the end, when they pulled out all the stompers the show really took off. During one of the better songs early on in the set some preppy 18-year-old twat in a black turtleneck decided to stagedive. For my money nothing is more rewarding than watching some guy stagedive only to have the crowd part before him like the Red Sea. But unfortunately that didn’t prevent him for jumping out from the stage three more times. Diving is sooo ten years ago, Dude! I mean the 70s had moshing, the 80s had moonwalking and the Safety Dance, and the 90s had diving. Now, how about we try something new like not acting like muppets in public and actually listen to the damn music? How does that sound? But even so it was an entertaining night out except for the opening act, The 22-20s, who looked like The Strokes , but sounded like an inept Jon Spencer cover band and played excruciatingly loud. They are definitely to be avoided in the future. I’ve been listening to Ben Folds Live and Slanted & Enchanted this weekend and they’re pretty great. Obviously, they’re very different albums, but both cool in their own way. The Ben Folds album has some really interesting versions of old favourites and there are a couple of songs, where the audience participation really lifts the songs up to another level. Slanted is one of those albums, where during the first listen you wonder how the hell this record ever got released, but after a few spins you start getting it. I’ve only been listening to the first CD, because those 24 songs are a lot to digest in themselves, so it’ll be a while before I want to listen to the live stuff. The weirdest thing I’ve seen today is an article claiming that the FBI has been investigating Bobby Fischer, because they thought his Mum was a commie spy. And to make the story even weirder the famous recluse has apparently been giving radio interviews lately praising the 9/11 attacks and made anti-Semitic comments. I guess Ben Kingsley won’t spend any more time Searching for Bobby Fischer . We're In It For The Money : Supergrass is playing here tonight, so naturally we’re going. I saw them the last time they played here as well and it was awesome. I’ve been listening to the new album quite a bit lately and although it’s not as good as their first two records there still are some choice cuts on there. The song Seen the Light was used in a phone commercial here, but the commercial came out a good month before the record came out, so it was a discussion point down the pub for a while if it actually were Supergrass or just someone, who sounded like them playing. The song is good though and so are tracks like Rush Hour Soul and Can’t Get Up . However, I do think Grace is an odd choice for a single. According to this NME review the guys haven’t lost it, so it’ll probably be a crackin’ show tonight. I saw an interview with British pop act Sugababes the other day and it went something like this: Interviewer : That was “You Know You’re Right”, the latest video by Nirvana. You guys like Nirvana? Keisha Sugababe : I only know that one song… Interviewer : Smells like Teen Spirit? Keisha Sugababe : How does that one go? Interviewer : Dah-da-da Da Da Dum Dah-da-da Da Da... Keisha Sugababe : Yeah, that’s the one! Nice to see the most important album of my generation still has an impact on the kids. I’m guessing she wasn’t the one, who came up with the idea to blend Are Friends Electric ? with Adina Howards’ Freak like Me . I’ve been playing Tony Hawk 3 lately and although I think it is fun I can sense that I won’t be playing much longer. I suck at it and if I don’t achieve a medal in Level 3 I won’t be able to open up the rest of the levels, which means I’ll be stuck playing the same three levels for the rest of my life. Isn’t that like Dante’s seventh ring of Hell? I ordered some stuff from Amazon this week and it’s already been shipped, which is so cool. I’ve decided to get back to work on my thesis, so I ordered We Blog: Publishing Online with Weblogs , which hopefully will have some insights that’ll motivate me to start writing again. I ordered Ben Folds Live , because I’ve always been a huge Ben Folds Five fan and on this CD Ben plays both solo and BF5 songs mixed with b-sides, covers, and tracks I haven’t even heard before. And to make it even cooler there’s a DVD with seven live tracks and live antics (whatever that is). I can’t wait to get that one. I have every Pavement album except Slanted & Enchanted , so when I found out a special Slanted & Enchanted remastered double CD had been released with live tracks, Peel sessions, EP tracks, and more I had to get it right away. And finally I ordered The Photo Album by Death Cab for Cutie, because I only have We Have The Facts… and I’ve been curious about there other albums for a while. I was working on my new Moveable Type blog yesterday, and it didn't exactly go according to plan. First off I have no idea how to make the text look like I want it and secondly my headers got messed up, when I transferred the files from Blogger . For some reason MT has taken the first 30-40 characters of each posting and copied them into the title box. That means I now have to go through every single posting and edit the title and remove the original title from the main text box. That'll give me somehting to do Friday night. That's What I Like About You : I mentioned Bill Maher's book When You Ride Alone You Ride with Bin Laden yesterday and it got me thinking about a poster we used to have on the door to the DJ booth at the internet radio station I used to work for. The poster read "When you pirate MP3s, you're downloading Communism", which we thought was pretty funny. Maher's book has a lot of "patriotic posters" inspired by posters made during World War II, but updated so they fit the into the post 9/11 scheme of things. If you want to find out more about the book he even has a special Ride Alone website. The downloading Communism poster is made by the people at Modern Humorist (who are also the geniuses behind this t-shirt ). I went over there today to find a link to the poster and came across their Fall 2002 TV Preview . This might only be fun if you watch as much television as I do, but even so I've picked out a couple of fun comments: Presidio Med (CBS): This medical drama revolves around a team of dedicated physicians that treats the patient, not the problem. Unlike "ER." Remember that time on "ER" when Dr. Carter left a five-year-old victim of a drunk driving accident on the operating table to catch the last quarter of a Bulls game? That shit will NOT fly at the Presidio. Still Standing (CBS): Jami Gertz, better than she ever did. Looking like a true survivor. Feeling like a little kid. Push, Nevada (ABC): Shot in the real-time format pioneered by Fox’s "24," this new drama series covers the 22-hour delivery of exotic dancer Nevada Stevenson’s first child. Seeing as Push, Nevada has already been cancelled maybe the world just isn't ready for a show about an IRS agent even if it's written by Ben Affleck. Maybe you've noticed that at times this site loads slower than a Clem Snide song and the comments are usually unreliable to say the least (and there's has been plenty of behind-the-scenes problems as well). So for a while I've been contemplating changing to Moveable Type . I've already moved the template over and as soon as I get the last bugs sorted out I'll probably make the switch completely. But until I figure out how to make my old headers like decent in the new MT setting you'll have to be patient with me. No Sissies Get Your Love : A lot has happened this week, so I’ll just mention a couple of highlights. I spent three days in Copenhagen hanging out and going to concerts. I saw Doves at Loppen and it was a very good show. They played about 75 minutes on a stage, which was about foot high, which meant the audience stood very close to the band. I was standing about 6 feet away from singer Jimi Goodwin, which meant I could look him straight in the eyes when he was singing, which was a bit weird. But they played a cool set with tracks from both Lost Souls and The Last Broadcast and ended with a track called Space Bass , which sounded like a Sub Sub track, but I think it might just be a new Doves track. Either way it was a kicking way to end the show. The next day I saw Hawksley Workman at Rust and that was simply amazing. He played a long show accompanied by a piano player called Mr. Lonely . There weren’t a lot of people at the concert, but it seemed like most of them were diehard fans ( Tinka was there, but I didn’t see her). He told weird stories and sang his weird songs and it was just incredible. My favourites were No Sissies and Sad House Daddy of the For Him & The Girls album and it was especially cool to hear the crowd take over vocal duties on the latter. He has the most remarkable vocal range going from theatrical Bertolt Brecht-like singing to Jeff Buckley-like falsetto, so it was actually quite funny hearing the fans trying to sing along with mixed success. Hawksley looks remarkable like Casey Affleck , but the scarf, earrings and sleeveless t-shirt made it easier to tell them apart. Besides going to concerts and hooking up with friends in Copenhagen I played Fifa 2003 , which is unbelievably cool and I saw 61- , which I also quite liked. The movie is about the season where Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris both tried to break Babe Ruth's homerun record. But it's actually a lot more about the two players as people and not so much about baseball. And I got to listen to the new Badly Drawn Boy album, which sounds mighty promising. I saw a fun episode of Leno recently with Bill Maher and Marilyn Manson (Maher was plugging his book and Manson his DVD ). I like Manson and I think he’s pretty funny, but the best bit was Maher going over the reason why George W. Bush wants to invade Iraq: [Mentions several bizarre reasons to invade Iraq] Maher: He (Saddam Hussein) tried to kill my Dad. This time it’s personal! Maher: And he gassed his own people. Leno: Well, didn’t he? Maher: Well yeah. In the 80s! Talk about your late reply. I mean are we looking into why Wham! broke up? Right 
ow I’m listening to the Ravens / Bengals game through NFL.com and it’s pretty exciting. For some reason the Ravens organisation doesn’t broadcast a signal from the games, so every week I’m listening to the opponent’s commentary and except for one guy these commentators are remarkable fair. Obviously, they support their own team, but they always give credit where credit is due and generally describe the games fairly. Except for one guy. Every time the Ravens play against the Pittsburgh Steelers a guy called Myron Cope makes me what to fly to Pittsburgh and open up a can of whup-ass. He has the most annoying screechy old-man’s voice ever and he gets so excited during the game that he stutters uncontrollably. He is completely unfair against the opposing team and last the Ravens played the Steelers he began making up words, so even his co-commentators had no idea what the hell he was talking about. You know how John Turturro has a face for radio in The Quiz Show ? Well, this guy has a voice for newspapers. He’s the main reason I hate the Steelers, because every time we played them I have to listen to that old fool talk nonsense for three hours. If you think I’m exaggerating try going through this treasure chest of babble (this is my “ favourite ”). And finally I got to meet someone this weekend, who I’ve been emailing with for ages. It’s always a bit strange meeting someone you know through emails face-to-face for the first time, but I thought this encounter was remarkably uncomfortable. When It's Time To Party We Will Party Hard : I'm on my way to Copenhagen, but I just thought I'd post something before I left. I was out Saturday night and for some reason I decided to write about it when I got home. Obviously, I'd had a few drinks, so it's probably for the best I didn't publish it right away. But I thought I'd edit it a bit and post it anyways. So here goes: So, last night was alright. Well, the drinking, talking, eating bit was fun. The dancing, clubbing, trying to get shagged bit was somewhat of a bust. And the reason is this: There is no good party music! Grease Mega Mix? The house version of Proud Mary? Boney M? All this is the kind of music I imagine is played in the elevators on the way to Hell. And this is what I have to endure on a night out on the town. To be fair they did sneak in a Prince and a Depeche Mode song, but in the course of four hours that is just not enough. I realize they can't play stuff like Dry the Rain or Cut Your Hair, but there has to be some sort of middle road. And to make matters weirder I wouldn't even have gotten in hadn't I gone to school with the doorman (I didn't bring my ID card and the age limit is all of 23). But to be fair it was still a decent enough night. Sure, I did spend most of the night standing in a corner with my arms wrapped around me like I was representing the East Coast, but at least I did get to meet a couple of charming members of the fairer sex and I got to hang out with friends I don't see that often. I guess I was a bit grumpy that night, but that's the way I get when I have to listen to shitty music. We ate at a cool restaurant where they had a lounge with bean bag chairs and a DJ, who played stuff like Koop's Summer Son. So going from that to Destiny's Child just brings me down, man.
Well, that's it I'm back in the real world having travelled back up through Africa and slowly made my way back to the Uk.My next task is to find myself a job. I also have to unpack my stuff and sort out my life. In the mean time there should be more time to do other things.I realise that there are a lot of missing holes in the blog and will make an effort to fill them in as soon as I can.Watch this space. Once again I have to say sorry for not updating the blog. I don't have any great excuses except to say that I have been very very busy. So busy that the only time that I have time to write an entry happens to be relief which is theoretically the busiest time down here at Halley. So here is a text entry of the past the present and the future. Hopefully I will get around to filling this in a bit more.So in short what has been happening? Well since my last entry I have been on my final winter trip and got some amazing photos (soon to be added). New people arrived on base and we had our first plane. I finally got down to see the penguins at Windy bay. Apart from that its been packing packing and more packing as we shut down the science here to make space for the building of the new base. The science team has packed over 5 tonnes already and I will be packing another tonne and a half before the end of relief. All this will be sent back to Cambridge or in the case of the AIS (which I looked after) Norway. Oh yeah my leg is fine, thanks for all the support. I have even been kiting
I'm pretty excited about this. Leave it to HBS to come up with the MBA Oath. Money quote (emphasis added): "One of Jeff Skilling's classmates has recalled a comment the ex-CEO of Enron made during a class about a dangerous consumer product: "I'd keep making and selling [it]. My job as a business man is to...maximize return to the shareholders. It's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous." As a student today at Harvard's business school, I hear echoes of those comments from my classmates ." Yikes. The author goes on: "In their reverence for the individual, business schools are remarkably bad at creating a sense of common purpose beyond an ambition to make money. Without a higher calling, bad actors flourish and those who want to speak out against them have little basis on which to challenge them." With much love to my HBS chums, this is not the way things are at all top business schools. And honestly, I can't imagine that (outside of a small, perhaps vocal element) that this isn't what it's really like at HBS either...is it? This is the second in a three part review of my favorite 10 shows of the decade that was. I've figured out the last show to include, but I'll save that for another post so I don't drown everybody with words. 5/05 Shins in OKC—A very nice show (Shins sound live exactly like they do on record) that was nicer because I was there enjoying it with Lauren. We hadn’t been dating that long at that point, and we drove up with our friends Bill and Rick. We all made it back to Ft Sill the next day to attend my Hail and Farewell from the Army. I was allowed a speech, and as many know I enjoy (a bit too much) any chance to be on the microphone. My speech that day concluded with: “Peace in the middle east, no blood for oil, I’m out!” and made a lot of people mad. It also caused one of my fellow officers, a 6 foot 5, 280 lbs black guy, to tell me that I was “one funky Caucasian”. Good times. Lauren and I wrapped up the weekend with a going away party at Rick’s place. Great weekend, and the Shins were a big part of it. 08/04 Wrens/Magnolia Electric Co in Denton—drove down by myself from Fort Sill to Denton, a city famous for death metal bands and being north of Dallas. I didn’t know anyone so I chatted with either band before the show. Indie shows are cool like that (especially back in 01-05 before indie blew up). Both performances were strong, and it was great to see two of my faves on the same stage. After several beers at the show I slept in my car until the next morning and then drove the 4 hours home. 6/06 Radiohead in Berkeley—The perfect culmination to years of Radiohead hero worship. Memorable because of the beautiful Berkeley summer night, and time spent with friends David Hyman, the Rotblats, and Nate Anthony. If I never see Radiohead again it would be a shame, but I am very cool with this night being my lasting memory of the Radiohead experience. 4/05 Wilco in OKC (2)—Bill Rausch and a sportsjacket. I don’t think I can legally say anything else about this show besides that. (Also, go see Wilco live. It’s expensive to do, nowadays, but it’s worth it.) In no order whatsoever, here is the first half of my live music retrospective on the decade that was. Part 2 will run later in the week. These aren’t necessarily the 10 best shows I saw, but for one reason or another they were the 10 most memorable. (Editors Note—part 2 currently only has 4 shows. If you attended a really memorable show with me in the last 10 years that didn’t make it in this post, please send me some inspiration!!!) 5/03 Built to Spill in LA—I’ve seen these guys more than any other band, and one show had to go on the list. This was easily the best show I’ve seen them play. They closed with a 15 minute version of Cortez the Killer during which Jim Roth did things with his guitar the likes of which I’ve never seen before or since. Epic. I have a poster of this show on the wall of my apartment. 4/06 Daft Punk at Coachella—I was there with several great friends Berkeley friends, to include the Kaplans and Anna Utgoff. DP wasn’t why I went to this festival, but it’s the one thing I’ll never forget about Coachella. This was the first show DP did with their giant laser pyramid (top left). It was as cool as everyone says it was. 12/05 Wrens in SF—I love the Wrens, and they’re always great live. I had seen them maybe 6 months earlier at the Pitchfork Intonation Music Festival in Chicago. At that show, for one song, they brought fans up on stage to play percussion with the band. When that song came up at this show I left my friends (Dan and Kelly) and pushed to the very front. I had a Bruce Springsteen/Courtney Cox moment with a member of the band, and he pulled me on stage with several fellow fans. When the singing came in I did what I do at shows—sang along. The band member, seeing I knew the words and wasn’t a completely awful singer pulled me into the mic so I could sing along with the band. We did it up, back-to-back 80s hair metal style, for the rest of the song. It was probably the coolest moment I’ve ever had at a concert, hands down. 3/06 Magnolia Electric Co/Okkervil River in Austin—At SXSW I won an MBA music case competition with Any, April Chris and Sung Hu. We had no passes (the guys at McCombs let us down) but a couple of us managed to hop the fence at this outdoor set and enjoy two really nice performances. 9/06 Silver Jews in SF—This was a good but unspectactular show on September 10th 2006. I went by myself and had made plans to try to meet up with David H, but he got held up doing other stuff. The show was memorable because I got my letter in the mail from Uncle Sam the next day calling me back to the Army. I saw a few other good shows before I cut myself off from music in 2007 to go overseas (Islands and Phoenix in SF come immediately to mind) but music wasn’t quite the same for me after this show, not for a long while at least. Once upon a time I loved making music lists. Really, really loved it. The problem was that my list skills never quite caught up with my enthusiasm for making them. For example: I spent an entire summer in 2003 trying to come up with a mix CD worth of songs that featured hand clapping. Sounds simple enough, right? But the project never really came together. In my mind, the songs had to be good, satisfactorily indie and/or ironic, and non-obvious enough that I would feel good (and snobby) about attaching my name to the list (so no “Theme from Friends”, etc). The whole thing started when I was driving around Alaska listening to “Nothing’severgonnastandinmywayagain” by Wilco, a song I loved (still do) so much that I would take my hands off of the wheel to clap along with the chorus. Same deal for “Alone Down There” by Modest Mouse and Ted Leo's “Timorous Me”. But those three songs ended up as the list. When I couldn’t think of any other songs that really got me excited I brought Megan and her brother Jeff into the conversation, and they had great suggestions that for whatever reason still didn’t quite make me happy. The final analysis: good idea, poor execution. In business school and in Seattle (when I was with Amazon) I made a lot of live music lists in an effort to get people to come to shows with me. It was fun, but didn't work that well either (I went to a lot of shows solo). Putting all that aside, I want to start 2010 with a few music lists for old time's sake. In a couple of days I'll lay out my favorite live music experience of the last 10 years, but tonight I'm going to rank where music fits in with all the other crap going in Exnicios-land circa 2000-2009. We'll call my parents emeritus to this list and not in the official running. Without further ado: 1. Lauren (my beautiful wife) 2. Graduating Duke (and all that went along with it) 3a. Going to war (even if I wasn't getting shot at) 3b. Being in the Army generally (I'm better at push ups and shooting things than I would have been) 5. Graduating from Berkeley (and all that went along with it) 6. Calhoun and Bailey (my dog and cat) 7. Music (only top 7...music's got to feel a little disappointed) 8. All of my other friends and family not captured by Duke, Army, Berkeley, etc. 9. The Washington Redskins (0-1 in the new decade!) 10. All the books I read This is a test.

That means it’s been more than a year since I got home and picked up again with my life with Lauren. In the last 14 months (Nov 2008 until now) we got a dog, had a re-wedding and went to New Zealand. I started working as a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton in March, but not until after I got to say that I was unemployed during the great economic meltdown. All told Lauren and I celebrated 7 other weddings with family and friends (very fun) and had to say goodbye to one of the best guys either of us had ever met (very, very sad). Lauren and I live in Old Town Alexandria, about 5 or 6 miles outside of DC proper. We both work in the District and we’ve settled into a really nice routine. I miss blogging. A lot. I think that I’m not awful at this, and I wish I had been better about writing in 2009. But for some reason it’s been hard for me to look at Army 2.0 for the last year. I don’t know why. In general I’ve had trouble engaging technology. Technology was my entire focus for 2 years at Haas, and I stayed pretty well connected to that world while I was in Afghanistan of all places. Home in DC, I feel more detached from the West Coast than I ever did in the war zone. Weird, I know. Life is great all the same. Lauren and I are really happy. And we’re going to figure the Coast thing soon (by which I mean before Lauren divorces me for indecision). So in conjunction with that decision, here is my 2010 to-do list: 1) Re-engage technology—spend less time reading about NBA teams I don’t care about and more time reading tech blogs 2) Blog a couple of times a week—I appreciate that anything I say now is less interesting than anything I said while on the forward edge of freedom, but still. Writing is fun. 3) For the first time, really embrace Facebook and Twitter—read above…poor, innocent social networking sites have suffered for the same reason my blog has. I am safely home with my family in Northern Virginia. As far as I know I have no further obligation to the Army for the next 6 months, and after that I'll be eligible to resign my commission. Sultan Jeff is home as well, but Chris is still over in Afghanistan. He was the last of my group to arrive, and he'll be the last to come home. Thank you for all of your thoughts, prayers, and well wishes (and clicks and eyeballs and links) over the last 16 months. The blog is not going to go away. We still have VPs to settle on, and the IRR story is something that will continue to develop as we see what direction the wars take under a new president. Thanks again, and I'll talk to everyone soon.

Thousands of products are basically indistinguishable without sampling. Massive variations in price exist between seemingly similar products. Many top brands are available regionally and in scarce supply. Therefore, to the casual consumer (most consumers) the choice of a wine is overwhelming. This makes the packaging extremely important. On a rack of 10 Chilean Syrah's you've never heard of before the only information you have to work with are packaging and price. There are essentially no features and benefits.

I was first exposed to Ex Number Five via the clunky yet harmless Razor Freestyle Scooter video game. Yeah, remember those Razor scooters? Every kid on the block had one back then. Despite not having anything in common whatsoever, the band gained a decent amount of public appeal from that game, and for good cause. They meant business when it came to their craft and musicianship, even down to perfecting the post-hardcore act; twin guitars lash out monstrous, melodic riffs that interchange, harmonize and play off of each other in a way that pulses as the group's lead auxiliary. Alf Bartone fronts a unique and powerful voice that gives their songs an extra injection of steroids, yet he manages to keep away from standard screamo territory. Even drummer Luke Bodenstein proved to be a vital asset with his diverse patterns and intricate fills, dropping serious onslaughts that drive each song home. The band has had a couple different bassists, but Chris Newman certainly threw in a meaty low-end on their later recordings.Preceded by a number of demos, The Team Players Association can be considered Ex Number Five's true output of studio material. My only gripe with an otherwise solid rock album is it only includes nine tracks. "(Not) Go" was the best of the two songs featured on Razor Freestyle Scooter, yet is sorely missed on the record and would have been an excellent bookend for the band's short-lived run.
It's not every day you lose someone you spent twenty years in space with. That's Dan O'Bannon I'm glaring at in this scene from Dark Star. We were never close, even though we did share a very cozy control room on that space ship. Nevertheless, I was always impressed with his talents, which ran deep in a various directions. I remember reading an interview where he described watching an early screening of Dark Star in which the audience wasn't laughing. It upset him that they didn't realize it was a comedy so he set out to scare the crap out of them instead...and wrote Alien. That worked! I'm obviously glad that Dark Star came to find cult status over time. Dan's name should always be mentioned in the same breath as John Carpenter when Dark Star is mentioned. I have no doubt that when I die Dan will be waiting to torment me with a rubber chicken once again. He was that kind of guy.
A driver's license gives you a certain level of freedom, but it also gives you an enormous amount of responsibility. When behind the wheel this responsibility comes in many forms : - Wearing seat belts - Driving sober - Focusing on the road - Driving defensively In Jan. 2009, NSC called for a nationwide ban on all cell phone use while driving. This comes after NSC researchers and statisticians reviewed more than 50 peer-reviewed research reports, many drawing the same conclusion. Drivers who use their cell phones have a significantly increased chance of getting into a car accident. MAKING OUR WORLD SAFER ...

You just can't tell anyone the rush you feel behind the handle bars of a Yamaha Nuevo...Anyone who has been to Asia knows that without a moto, you can't get around. Motorbikes, motorcycles, mopeds outnumber cars on the roads of Bali, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. For the traveller, it is a necessity to learn how to drive one and how to properly disembark without burning your leg on the right side exhaust which each traveller does at least once as evidenced by the red marks on the tan legs all over south east asia.

We hit Calcutta downtrodden, exhauseted emotionally and physically, we were limping to the finish line...The journey from Nepal to Bodhgaya and then on to Calcutta had been arduous to say the least. We were almost stranded in Bodhgaya and could not take a rickshaw as we were told they were too dangerous at night and we would be robbed. The area is very unsafe and full of bandits and we only made our train by paying a local a relatively exhorbitant amount of money to drive us to the train station. When we arrived to Calcutta's dingey traveller's area we were in bad shape but needed to stick it out to finish buying our instruments. We spent a hot day searching through the various music stores and came away with a very nice set of tablas. CLICK HERE or on the image to download slideshow.

It was a tough 4 days as you can read in the entry below, but we made it, even though we had doubts that we would at several times during the journey. When we arrived at this oasis, we were greeted by the sight of monks from all over the world dressed in white, safron, yellow, and red robes chanting and doing prostrations (bowing up and down many times). One cannot but help to feel the profound energy and importance that emanates from this sight, where thousands of monks have been meditating for thousands of years. Upon arrival we circled the grounds which contain many Bodhi trees, temples, and stupas, found a comfortable spot under the same tree as Buddha reached enlightenment and tried to do the same... CLICK HERE or on the image to view slideshow. We left Kathmandu 4 days ago thinking it would take 2 to reach Bodhgaya, India. We could not have predicted what lay in store for us though. Our pilgrimage started out with optimistm and energy but ended with frustration and freyed nerves. Bodhgaya is home of the Bohdi tree which Sidartha Guatama, or Buddha, reached enlightenment under. Until, we began researching our trip, I did not know that you could visit the actual tree, I thought it was just a myth or a story, but there is an actual tree. Unfortunately, to get to Bohdgaya, we had to go through hell. The roughest part of our trip up until this point was going from India to Nepal, but from Nepal into Bihar, India was surpassed it. Never was the difference between Nepal and India so evident. Literally, after crossing the border, the vibe of our trip changed, the tone of the people changed...we were thrown back into fending away desperate people who were intent on selling us something or stealing what we had. I cannot judge these people because they are so poor, I do not know what I would do in their situation... Malcolm has been very ill with Giardia, and we have been stuck on dirty trains, horse drawn carts, auto and bicycle rickshaws who have been anything but honest. The 2 hour bus ride from Muzamphur to Patna was by far the worst of the trip. We had to literally fight people to get a seat, and when we did sit down we were wedged in by people nad luggage. If the bus would have flipped we would have been done. The foul air, thick from chemicals from plastic waste bonfires wafted in throughh the windows and gave us headaches. In Patna, we could not find a guesthouse to sleep in, apparently because we were foreigners. We finally found a place that catered to tourists and we had to pay the most for lodging that we have so far. Upon collapsing on the bed we were excited to order food asw we had not eaten all day. Unfortunatley, the yogurt in the Lassi drink I ordered was off and I began throwing up in the toilet. The hotel staff would not give us our money back and the hot water which should be standard in a hotel of this price did not work. We left the next morning and made the final leg of the journey to Bodhgaya by bus and by rickshaw. Bodhgaya, is located in the state of Bijar, by far the most dangerous, poor, and lawless region of India. You must watch your back at all times and unfortunately, Buddha's prophecy that the area would be forever plagued by famine, poverty, and war has been true. It is ironic that the holiest of all Buddhist sites is in the middle of such a place. At this point we are feeling that we are enduring India rather than enjoying it. However, we have been looking forward to reaching Bodhgaya and the Bohdi tree and are looking forward to meditating under it and soaking up the ambience.
I have no interest whatsoever in defending the latest round of ridiculous buck-passing going on in the House. The idea, apparently, is that they're going to pass the raft of fixes to the health care bill and simply 'deem' the Senate bill passed. Somehow this is supposed to reduce process-based attacks from the Republicans. The mind boggles. Sometimes you wonder how the Democratic Party hasn't self-immolated yet. We're talking about an absolute core principle of the party. If you aren't interested in trying to get millions of more people some basic health care than what exactly are you doing in the party anyway? And if, even worse, you're Dennis Kucinich, how can you sleep at night knowing how much good this bill would do but still opposing it because it doesn't achieve the purity of alien-inspired dreams? But now we're facing the possibility that living, breathing people who were capable of getting themselves elected to the House of Representatives in the most powerful country the world has ever seen are simultaneously so stupid that they think this legislative rigmarole is going to help them. While I've stated repeatedly that all the fuss about the 'Cornhusker kickback' and such things is mostly an illusion generated by the process, apparently House Democrats are absolutely terrified of it. So terrified that they're not even willing to go on record as having voted for the bill that contains it. Despite the fact that they're going to turn around and IMMEDIATELY vote for another bill that removes it. A bill, by the way, that will be immensely popular and create a serious bind for the Republicans. Because if they just do this the old-fashioned way, the initial vote to pass the Senate bill makes health care the law of the land. They pass it and Obama signs it and it's LAW. At that point, the Republicans in Congress are going to be faced with a seriously deadly choice. They can continue to go nuts and vote against everything health care related--but that will put them on record as attempting to SUSTAIN the 'Cornhusker kickback' and the 'Big Apple buyout' and the 'Sooner snicker-doodles' or whatever. Or, they can vote for the patch and seriously undermine their "health care is going to pay for Rahm Emanuel to kill your grandmother in a big field of corn" message. Since they will have voted for a bipartisan fix to it. But no, the Democrats want to get all fancy now, and adopt a mechanism that is questionably constitutional and stupid on the merits . The whole Democratic establishment has drawn battle lines now . Obama, the House leadership, the Senate leadership, unions, everyone. They're all making it clear that this needs to pass and that they're willing to completely withdraw electoral support for people who don't join in - even to the point of funding primary opponents. And good for them. Even if it wasn't politically smart (which it is), there are some moments when you just have to do what is right and let the chips fall where they may. I don't often like what Will Saletan has to say, but his recent piece on this is spot-on: Maybe passing the health care bill will bring on a Republican tsunami. Maybe it will create a generation of Democrats who revere Obama the way their great-grandparents revered FDR. Maybe you'll be back in Congress next year. Maybe you won't. Either way, this is too big a vote to cast on the basis of politics. Every so often, a bill comes along that's bigger than anything your predecessor got to touch. You're the lucky bastard who had your seat in 2010, when that bill reached the floor. And here you are, worrying about your career, when the purpose of your career is staring you in the face. It's time to just pass the damn bill already. If Congress wasn't full of egotistical maniacs who wanted to get everything juuuuust right this would have passed three or four months ago. Or in January. Or February. But better late than never. Just pass the damn thing and demonstrate that you're not total goobers. Begging to Bleed - Foundation The reason I like this song is that it really reminds me of "Let My Love Open the Door," except with a folksy style that reminds me a lot of the Billy Bragg/Wilco project. If that sounds appealing to you, then you'll probably like this one a lot. If not, well, I warned you. The album is called Chimborazo , and it came out last year. Are House Republicans really going to try to run ads accusing the Democrats of voting for unpopular parts of the Senate bill like the ‘Cornhusker Kickback’? Really? I know political attention spans are often as short as goldfish, but surely the counter-ad “I voted for a bill to ensure that the Cornhusker kickback was removed, while my opponent voted AGAINST that bill” would be pretty damning. Unless the Republicans are planning on voting for the patch – and thus completely ruining their “Obama = health care = teh socialism = ZOMGs” message? Okay, so they're not reuniting. But they ARE playing a show together in July. And (for all the people who have lamented being unable to actually obtain their music after hearing me rave about them), they're re-releasing their albums through my new favorite record label, Hardly Art . In addition, they've got a compilation coming out on July 13, called They’ll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996 – 2003. My only complaint on that front is that it's got only a couple tracks from Ugly But Honest (my #1 album of the past decade ). But when there's so much great stuff to choose from, you can't really get it wrong. Track list for the compilation record: 1. Low Budget Slow Motion Soundtrack Song For the Leaving Scene 2. Die 3. The Color That Your Eyes Changed With the Color of Your Hair 4. One Night Stand 5. You Should Be Hated Here 6. Drunk with the Only Saints I Know 7. Phantom Fireworks 8. So You Wanna Be A Superhero 9. Brooke Daniels' Tiny Broken Fingers 10. Ignorant Piece of Shit 11. Blessed Arms That Hold You Tight, Freezing Cold and Alone 12. Blue Champagne Glass 13. September Come Take This Heart Away 14. All Apologies and Smiles, Yours Truly, Ugly Valentine 15. Sympathy Bush 16. They'll Only Miss You When You Leave Jonathan Chait is weirdly puzzled over the lyrics to "You're So Vain" by Carly Simon (which is not about David Geffen , despite what you may have heard). Chait says: "[N]othing about the song makes any sense. She's giving an extremely detailed description of a former lover, but insisting that his being able to recognize the description is evidence of vanity." But that's why it's clever! The whole point of the song is that the person is vain, smug, self-satisfied, thinks the world revolves around himself...and is wholly justified in thinking so. At least in respect to the narrator. The song IS about him, after all. It works in the same way that a great "I'm SOOOO over you" song works. If you were really over them, you wouldn't have to write a song about it. And if she wasn't obsessed with him, then his vanity wouldn't be a problem. Right? And then there's a whole additional layer, which is that she has played the vagueness of the subject matter into a multiple-decade-long mystery. So obviously the specific stuff is meant to be true in spirit but not literally correct. The result being: there are quite a few people who might think the song is about them - and by doing so it BECOMES a song about them. Get it? Anyways, it's more fun to not know than it ever would be to get an answer. Puppets - Jose Vanders The puzzlingly named Jose Vanders (as in, she's a she) is embedded firmly in the grand tradition of waif-voiced folksy women playing sweet songs about love and life and growing up. Think of a young Regina Spektor with a bit of the Kate Nash snark. I realize that for some people that might not sound like an endorsement - in which case you're probably better off just passing through. But for those who like a little bit of sweetness in their lives, give this one a listen. In addition to being simple, pure, serene...it's also a lot of fun. The general theme ("I'm a puppet for you") doesn't feel overdone, and the clapping (following the line "I've got strings tied to my fingers, pull them down, and I'll clap for you") is amusing without treading into being precious. "Puppets" is from an EP called Red, Black, Blue, and the Tortoise , which came out a couple years ago. Fit - Windmill (from Puddle City Racing Lights ) Perfect Fit - Laurel Music (from This Night and the Next ) So I'm thinking about buying a new car. This is a pretty major deal since I've been driving the same Dodge Caravan for about 12 years now. And while I love the old minivan, the recognition of rising gas prices and the initial investment required to buy a car designed for a family leads me to believe I really ought to buy a nice little fuel-efficient car. I think I've settled on the Honda Fit. It gets great reviews, good gas mileage, is among the cheaper options out there, and apparently has the coolest folding back seat in the world which actually produces some reasonably good storage space for a small car. The question I have for you, gentle blog-readers, is this: do you have any experience, positive or negative, with the Fit? Is it a good choice? Should I be considering something else? I've written about Slapstick a few times before - and it seems strange to keep coming back to a band that's been defunct for a decade at this point. But still, I just can't say no. The excuse this time is my discovery of some tracks from them that had completely slipped under my radar. Way back in the day I picked up their Slapstick CD, which I believed to be a complete collection of their released material. Turns out there's some other stuff floating around, including this track, which embodies everything there is to love about the band: I Hate Girls - Slapstick Like a cold gust of Chicago wind reaching us all the way from some dark club in the 90s filled with snotty ska-punk of the very best sort. A dirty guitar riff, horns that rise out and above, lyrics about lusting after a girl at a Jawbreaker show, and that absolutely glorious "la la, la la la la la" chorus. What's not to like?
As another cross blog venture, my good pals at The Philosophy of Time Travel and LastBestAngryMan have invited me to participate in a number of top 5 lists as this decade draws to a close. We have very different musical tastes in terms of our favorite stuff, but I also think we all are willing to listen to a lot of different stuff so there is some crossover. Lists like this are by their very nature completely subjective, but the point has always been to simply tell everybody they are wrong about everything. 5) Kid A by Radiohead This album represents for me the height of Radiohead's greatness - better than everything that came before and much better than everything that has come since. They take their first steps here into really stretching into experimentation but still keep some pop hooks, and the result is just tremendous. Everybody knows at least one or two songs by Radiohead just from osmosis, but what is interesting is that all these years later, you still have a chance of hearing something from The Bends or OK Computer on your radio but very little chance of hearing anything from this album which surely must be their best. 4) Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco This album is for Wilco what the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock must have been like for T.S. Eliot: once you produce something this good, how can you live up to it again? Keeping with that analogy, we still haven't seen Wilco's equivalent of The Waste Land . They are still making great music (and I just saw them in concert this year incidentally), but they've never been able to replicate the heights of fancy and genius they hit with this album early in the decade. That's not a knock against the band as few have ever hit heights like this. From the very beginning lyrics: "I am an American Aquarium drinker" you know you are going to get something a little bit different - but through it all it remains a coherent, sometimes heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful work that stands as something to be listened to from beginning to end. 3) Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Vol 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness by Coheed and Cambria Rock Band was basically the greatest thing to happen to these guys in terms of popularity as the fantastic track "Welcome Home" from this particular album is featured in the game, and was also featured in the preview for the movie "9". But more than just that particular single, this is the 3rd album in a series of 4 that comprise an entire sci-fi rock opera by the group, telling a singular tale that, while often clumsy/impenetrable in terms of narrative, serves to tie the whole project together in a single thread. This 3rd volume is in my opinion the strongest with so many great tunes that stand alone, but in particular "Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)" and "Apollo I: The Writing Writer" rise to such bizarre heights of creativity in subject matter while at the same time keeping coherent metal hooks - it's just brilliant stuff all around. All 4 albums are terrific, but this one for me is the best of the project. 2) Takk.. by Sigur Ros Sigur Ros stands alone in their own category of music making right now for me insofar as I firmly believe they are the most important band out there today. You could argue there are other bands that are better but the reason Sigur Ros is so essential is they are in the unique position of being legitimately popular . How this, by pop standards, weird group from Iceland became pop icons is completely lost on me but I'm totally okay with it because it really shows that all is not lost - people WILL listen to truly great music given the opportunity. If you had told me when Agaetis Byrjun was released that "Svefn-g-englar" would feature prominently on an episode of the TV show "V", I would've told you that was patently absurd. It was very difficult to choose between this album and () (also called "Two Sausages Kissing" in jest) only because () was probably more important for the band's development, but I've listened to Takk.. too many times not to make this the album I choose. I remember hearing Glosoli for the first time when I saw the band in concert - they were touring just before the release of Takk.. - and having my mind utterly blown. When I think of the Platonic model of "hope", I think of that song. 1) Lateralus by Tool This is bar none my favorite band, and this is my favorite album by that band. I get it that Tool isn't for everybody (just people who know what they're talking about), but it is tough to find a musician anywhere who won't at least admit that these guys are all absolutely ridiculous when it comes to the technical talent on display at every instrument in this band. Perfect Circle is a nice project for Maynard and I enjoy them, but this is where Maynard's home is, and this is where he does his best work. It's amazing that this album came out in 2001 and nothing has come out that has been better, including Tool's own 10,000 Days which, while awesome, didn't quite hit the level of Lateralus simply because track for track there are absolutely no weaknesses on Lateralus. Perhaps the way I can most easily sum up the level of this band is to relay this story: after seeing this band in concert with one of my friends who is a musician, he simply turned to me and said "Well, that was intimidating." Indeed. Some context for below - tonight the local minor league team, the Wilmington Blue Rocks , are having "Cowboy Monkey Rodeo Night", which involves monkeys dressed as cowboys riding on dogs. This led to the chat below with a good friend: me: tonight is awesome &nbsp;&nbsp;Cowboy Monkey Rodeo night + fireworks &nbsp;&nbsp;Monkeys in cowboy outfits riding dogs Friend: shouldn;t they be called Dogboy Monkies? me: Cowboy Monkey will lasso you good for suggesting this &nbsp;&nbsp;they don't round up dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;they ride them Friend: yeah true &nbsp;&nbsp;what do they round up? Squirrels? &nbsp;&nbsp;COWS??? me: what they round up are good times &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodtimeboy Monkeys Friend: now that would be illegal - making monkeys round up squirrels while riding dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;then - you feed the losing team to a shark &nbsp;&nbsp;THAT'S good times me: I don't want to live in a country where you can't watch monkeys dressed as cowboys riding dogs herding squirrels tossing them to sharks &nbsp;&nbsp;and you can quote me on that One of the many things that makes baseball the greatest sport in the world is that it represents stability - every March, players start training for April. Every April, thousands of fans show up for Opening Day at their respective ballparks, filled with the hope of possibility - even if their team is predicted to lose 100 games this year, it hasn't happened yet: everybody starts 0-0. As the oft maligned former commissioner Bart Giamatti said: It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. In other words, it appeals because there is so little about the game that ever changes. It is as familiar as the spring, as familiar as the sun rising and setting. When Harry Kalas died yesterday, it surprised me that it hurt. It didn't seem to me at first like I had any right to really be affected: after all, I didn't know Harry personally. I never met the man. I was just a Phillies fan, one that probably took him for granted too often like many others, so used to him calling the games that it didn't even cross my mind that someday, he wouldn't be around to do it. Harry called every Phillies game of my entire life - his presence was as ubiquitous as the Phillies themselves, as baseball itself. I stare out the window at what is a gloomy day here in Delaware, and I know the spring will come. I know that everyone will eventually move on, myself included, because baseball, like life, goes on. But for right now, for this moment, Harry is gone, and with him the spring and the promise that both it and baseball bring. The promise they represent - that there are windows of opportunity in life where anything seems possible - for now seems to have disappeared. The feeling will pass, as all things do, and no matter how much we might want things to stay the same, no matter how much we might want to turn on the game tomorrow night and hear Harry call it, comforted by the familiarity of it all, it won't happen. We learn to adjust. Baseball represents that too, you know: the game may not change, but the people do. It's not a bad thing or a good thing, it just is. Right now though, I just want it to feel like spring, the way it did on Sunday when the Phillies won and Harry called the game, and everything was exactly as I thought it should be on an afternoon in April - and now can't ever be precisely the same again. I absolutely love movies, but I dislike going to the movie theater . In the past 2 years I've seen maybe a half dozen movies in the theater, and very rarely will I go on a busy movie day (like a Friday night) if I go at all. I like a nice Sunday matinee, but really with TVs and DVD players being what they are, with all of the easy access we have to movies via Netflix, movie channels, TiVo, Netflix on TiVo, etc. it just seems kind of silly sometimes to go to a movie theater when I (personally) can be guaranteed to enjoy the experience at home. Going to the movie theater is not a sure good time, mostly because of the occasional rudeness of other movie-goers. But sometimes you just can't avoid the hype and you find yourself unwilling to wait for the DVD release. My buddies at LastBestAngryMan and The Philosophy of Time Travel agreed we would all post our top 5 most anticipated films of 2009. Here's the top 5 movies I'm most likely to see in the theater in 2009, which by proxy means they are the most anticipated: 5) 9 - This film will mark the real feature film directing debut for Shane Acker , who really cut his teeth doing animation with Weta during the Lord of the Rings films. Here's the deal with this one - Acker made a 10 minute or so short film around the concept a few years ago. The movie is embedded below. The film coming out in theaters this year is the whole story. The visual style is super cool and I'm always a fan of animation in all its incarnations. Short film "9": Feature Film Trailer, featuring a terrific song by Coheed and Cambria : 4) The Lovely Bones - There are two big reasons I'm looking forward to seeing this. Number one, the book is absolutely terrific and for me exceeded the critical hype. Number two, Peter Jackson is directing, and the material from the book is something I think he could prepare a feast with. No trailer available yet. 3) The Wrestler - This movie is technically out right now in the US but only under limited release. I check every weekend to see if it is out around Delaware but so far no luck. The number one reason I want to see this: I haven't seen a Darren Aronofsky movie yet that I haven't loved. I also have a soft spot in my heart for the material here because when I was a kid I was a huge fan of pro wrestling. There's a lot of Oscar talk swirling around Mickey Rourke's performance in this one, if that kind of stuff matters to you. 2) Public Enemies - It's a 1930s crime drama starring Christian Bale and Johnny Depp directed by Michael Mann. If you need any more explanation than that I have no idea what to tell you. 1) Watchmen - I'm worried about this movie. Really, really worried. There is a very good reason that Watchmen is the only graphic novel on Time's 100 greatest novels list: it is an absolute masterpiece. It is also really, really complex and has always seemed like it would be a nightmare to faithfully translate to the big screen. We already know that at least one key element (the Tales of the Black Freighter framing device) will not be in the movie. There are more and more reports suggesting that the ending has been changed. The director's original 3 hour cut was apparently loathed by the studio and who knows if it will survive tampering. The whole thing is a recipe for a colossal disaster. But I had a lot of the same skepticism with Lord of the Rings , and boy was I completely wrong there. This easily gets #1 because it is probably the only movie I will definitely see this year in the theater, and that's because there's no way I'll be able to avoid it. A great deal of my friends love the graphic novel as much as I do, and I'll be unable to avoid discussions of this movie when it is finally out. Hopefully they will be discussions about how we were totally wrong about all our concerns over the movie. You don't need to know the ins and outs of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to know that it's bad. In fact, it has been so bad for so long that whenever another bombing or act of terrorism is reported, it just seems to roll like water off a duck's back for most folks. It says something when a story of cooperation is more unexpected and surprising than a story of people blowing each other up. It says something sad about the way things are there. But it also says something awe inspiring at just how far some people will go to try to change things, even on the tiniest of levels. ------- When you say "football", people from different parts of the world will think of different things. Most, of course, will think of what we call in America "soccer". In Australia though, they think of their own variation of "rugby" - Australian rules football. In 2002, Australia hosted the first ever Australian Football International Cup . The idea was to promote interest in the sport in other countries by hosting a tournament that Australia itself would not participate in. It's the kind of thing I can't imagine America bothering to host - we'd want to win our own tournament, after all. But since Australia has the only professional league for their unique sport, it made sense to sit out this tournament because winning was almost guaranteed. Why not give other teams playing their sport in other countries a chance to compete and measure their talents? The tournament was enough of a success that it was hosted again in 2005, and now it will happen a third time here in 2008. This year 16 teams from around the world will compete for the trophy, the most since the tournament started. When you look at the list of teams competing , one jumps out at you: Peace Team . A strange name for a side participating in a rough and tumble game. ------- In January of 2008, Australian football legend Robert "Dipper" Dipierdomenico, along with some other league representatives, presented the rules of the game to a room full of 100 young men. Out of that 100, 40 were selected to participate in a 3 day clinic to learn the basics of the game. The unusual part of the story: these young men were a mix of Israelis and Palestinians, and the clinic was in Jerusalem. Perhaps crazy enough was the idea of getting a team of men completely unfamiliar with the sport ready to compete internationally in just under 8 months. But even crazier was the idea of trying to do it here, with these men. The team faced complications trying to train that would be completely unheard of elsewhere. The coach's instructions needed to be translated to both Hebrew and Arabic. The team was shut out of their Israeli training facility for 4 days during a visit by President Bush when all Palestinians were denied access, including Palestinian members of the team. Team members received threats from both sides of the conflict, either enduring the usual hate from one side or being called "traitor" by the other. Palestinian team members needed to obtain work permits for every training session, sometimes traveling upwards of 4 hours through various security checkpoints. The pressure was too much for a number of the players. Some of them, facing threats from their own friends and neighbors, left the team. In spite of all of this, a few kept practicing. A few kept playing. In spite of the lack of a proper field (they played on soccer fields) with proper goalposts (they had none), they kept learning. The first time the team had seen real goal posts was when they arrived in Australia a week ago. They play their first match of the tournament today 
gainst Great Britain. ------- New Zealand and Ireland will be the favorites going into the tournament. The Peace Team will probably be lucky to win a single match. But win or lose, they will do it together . "Everyone knows the story in Israel and Palestine, the occupation, the killings, bombings, we came here to show the people, we came for the peace, we need the peace," says Palestinian ruckman Fares Switte. In January, it's not likely Fares Switte knew what a ruckman was. But then again, in January, the whole notion of a team like this was pretty unlikely too. ------- After the tournament is over, the players on the Peace Team will return to their normal lives. They will return to face the same strife and conflict they faced before they started playing together. They might even return to find themselves reviled in their own homes. But they'll return changed in this small way, knowing this simple thing: if we can play together, we can live together. ------- Note: For a tremendous introduction to the various factions and pieces in play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I can't recommend the game Peacemaker enough. It is easily the most engaging introduction I've ever seen, better even than any book I have read on the topic. And yes, it has a Mac version. It's an ever shrinking world. On the one hand it means we tend to fight a little more over resources that we all need. On the other hand, it means we have a better opportunity than ever to learn to live with each other. I'm a big fan of the Olympics. I'm talking about an event where we get to see sports that we probably won't see for another 4 years, but with a built in rooting interest. We root for our country. We root for the human interest stories. We root for the ideal that we can all, just maybe, get along for a couple weeks. Of course the ideal is not reality. The Olympics are bringing some of China's questionable government practices out into the world spotlight. The games are sometimes overshadowed by stories of the conflict in Georgia. In spite of these things, sport goes on. The beauty of sport as a fan is that, for the duration of the match, game, whatever, you aren't thinking about those things. It is not a good idea to ignore what goes on in this world. But it's not a bad thing to set it aside once in awhile. ----- Imagine you've got a tumor in your belly growing so large that it begins to push all of your internal organs, liver, intestine, kidneys... all to the sides of your body. Imagine that the hospital that is trying to treat you has just been taken over by a group that is likely to kill you if they see you. Imagine that it doesn't matter anyway, since the doctors have told you there is nothing they can do to save you. Imagine you are two years old. This boy exists, and he lives in Iraq, the child of a Sunni family whose hospital had been taken over by Shiite militia. On the other side of the world, in Boston, someone hears of this, a wealthy, 85 year old liquor tycoon whose own son died of an incurable form of cancer. The world is shrinking. The elderly fellow from Boston pays for the young boy's family to fly to Jordan where there is a very dim hope of treatment with the tumor so far advanced. The doctors in Jordan do not know what will happen, but it is the only hope. It is not a miracle what happens next . A miracle would be something that defies all explanation. I don't yet believe that acts of human kindness defy all explanation. ----- The pursuit of athletic excellence is an ideal, just like the pursuit of global peace. They may both be fleeting things sometimes, but that doesn't mean they don't occasionally exist, even if only in very small batches. For just a few moments, when Michael Phelps breaks another world record, for a fleeting moment he is the pinnacle of athletic excellence. For just a few moments, when a young Iraqi boy walks out of a hospital in Jordan after treatment paid for by a elderly man in Boston, they are world peace. The world is shrinking. And it is not a bad thing. Aaaaand we're back. So as of today I am 30 years old. Things couldn't be better. I've written before about what I think the advantages to getting older are and I still stand by those things. Bill Watterson once suggested that people who remember childhood as an idyllic time were probably never children, and that's a statement I agree with. It's not like being a kid was bad (it wasn't), but it's a pretty amazing (and sometimes scary) thing to have a modicum of control over your life. I also maintain it is awesome to be able to have the authority to scold those younger than you are. Age is the type of completely arbitrary authority that just increases with every passing day. Just this morning I pulled into the parking garage at work and there was a young fellow blasting music out of his car. Just the fact that I could legitimately think to myself: "That young punk, what's he doing playing music at that volume this early in the morning" and actually have a small part of that thought be automatically accurate (the part about him being "young" compared to me, not necessarily the part about being a punk, he's probably a real swell kid, I mean after all he is arriving at work at 7:30 AM just like I am, probably during his summer vacation) is the type of thing that I find internally amusing enough to keep me in a good mood. So, where have I been these past several months? Well, I haven't been doing anything particularly epic. Since getting married, Jules had been busy studying for the Delaware Bar Exam (a 3 day test which she finished taking last week, results in October) and I've been doing... whatever it is that I do. And frankly that's what I LIKE doing. There was a time in the heady days of my youth (you know, like 8 years ago) where I would have been terrified of the notion of working a 35-40 hour a week job, settling in to some kind of routine. Now it's really what I enjoy most. Some of my best times are just relaxing at home talking to Jules, reading a book or watching baseball on the tube together. I'm a much more boring guy than I used to be, but I consider that to be a good thing. So why haven't I been updating the blog then? What's the excuse? Well, there really isn't any. But I've been thinking during all those months I haven't been writing about what this blog is exactly. Is it a journal? Is it a blog about games? Shouldn't it have a theme of some kind? And I've kind of decided that there are enough blogs out there that spend their time discussing games, and enough blogs out there that are just journals. There are enough blogs out there that complain and mock various things, and really I'm not as good at any of that stuff as they are. So as of today, I'm going to try something new with the blog. I'm going to go for a general theme of optimism. A general theme that says "life can be pretty cool." That may still involve games that I think are fun and self-deprecating personal anecdotes and some of the other random stuff I throw up here... but the gist will be the type of kerfuffle that puts a smile on my face. We'll see, maybe it will put a smile on yours. And if you got this far, thanks for not unsubscribing from this thing. I'm starting to see the following expression used more and more in various publications these days, particularly by journalists: Searching for X on Google produces Y results in Z seconds. If you haven't seen this before, let me give you a couple of examples: From Law.com : Online virtual worlds are wildly popular, attracting millions of people every day, and a recent Google search for MMORPG yielded approximately 32 million results. From the Toronto Star : Partner new Blue Jay shortstop David Eckstein and the word "scrappy" and a Google search will advise you of some 5,300 possibilities. In just 0.38 seconds, too. From Jose Canseco's new steroid book, Vindicated : Put in 'Alex Rodriguez' and 'infidelity' and you'll get like fifty thousand hits. The gist I guess is that there is supposed to be some correlation between X and Y . People, please stop this madness. Maybe you think it's a cute gimmick and a nice alternative to the old stock " Meriam Webster defines 'infedility' as... " type of intro, but all it does is expose you as a complete idiot. For the love of god, there is no correlation between X and Y . It's a firk ding blasting search engine, it goes and gets as many results as it can. Allow me to demonstrate via the following examples of my own. If there was any question that more dinosaurs are wearing pink hats now than ever before, just pair "pink hat" with "dinosaur" in a Google search. You'll get 635,000 results in 0.17 seconds. I always thought bananas were funny looking, like they're from another planet. You might be surprised to hear that a Google search of "aliens plant bananas" yields 526,000 results in 0.29 seconds. Bananas may be the proof we need that we are not alone. Recycling for the planet is one thing, but what about recycling what our own body produces for ourselves? A quick Google search of "lose weight by drinking raw sewage" gives you 153,000 results in just 0.32 seconds. It's obviously an idea worth considering. To writers everywhere, I am begging you this last time to please stop this insanity, or so help me I will Google "[your name here] is completely brain dead", thus proving forever that somebody needs to pull your plug.
ruches - beehives Originally uploaded by parisdelhi Reconciling life in Togo and life in the US hasn't been fun. Contrary to what one would think given how the whole world is trying to train Africa out of its supposed backwardness, I have more or less come to the conclusion that the culture, eating habits, amount of physical activity, societal structure and the general way of life of my village in Togo are much healthier than those of the US. In the US we have plenty of money but we no longer know how to live, for the most part we are unhealthy and lost in modern life, and what is worse is that the rest of the world is trying to copy us. In Togo, for the most part people know how to live well. The only thing that is missing is a bit more money. That is where beekeeping becomes useful... One could very well argue that in the end money will manage to strip Africa of its knowledge of how to live well. In that case money is the culprit. pitching in Originally uploaded by parisdelhi To conclude TV or Radio news stories about climate change and the declining livability of the planet, the same message is often repeated: that scientists agree that recycling and more efficient cars and equipment will not suffice to greatly improve the prospects of maintaining a highly livable planet and avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. What is truly needed to improve our chances, scientists conclude, is for humans to fundamentally change their behavior. While listening to international dialog about the human-planet relationship, I hear talk of more efficient power plants and more recycling centers, that help us to comsume more with less or allow us to pollute less or as much while consuming more, I don't hear much serious talk about the scientific community approved idea of societal behavior change or cultural change. In very many ways, I find village life with its hard work, basic foods, and rudimentary entertainment, to be much more healthy than life in the modern desire-driven world. I am fully aware that clean water, good sources of nutrition, and health care are necessary, but how much more than that is NECESSARY? And to what extent does having MORE than that actually have a NEGATIVE impact on our mental and physical health, and on the health of our surrounding world? It is my belief that we spend much more money and resources solving problems created by modernity's attempt to satisfy desires than we spend solving the problem of fundmental needs. Finding fulfillment in the satisfaction of those fundamental needs and foregoing our 24/7 all you can eat "desire saticiety," is a road that interests me. What does humanity want? Health, happiness, and the fulfillment of fundamental needs or the fulfillment of unending fleeting desires, less happiness, and declining human and environmental health? I'll end with a quote from Thomas Merton: "No man can serve two masters. Your life is shaped by the end you live for. You are made in the image of what you desire." Humanity must decide what it wants and then make a conscious effort to pursue what it wants even if that entails modifying very dear cultural behaviors... DSC01635 Originally uploaded by parisdelhi While I was in Togo I had many personal debates taking place and some of them made their way onto this blog. Some debates encouraged external help coming to Africa and others would seem to discourage external aid. I am happy that I had all of those debates because they allowed me to explore international development, Africa, social change, and more, but I want to make clear that there is a place, a lot of places, for well conceived external help that responds to real needs. I will do my best to meet a few of those needs on a small scale where I can be competent. In the photo you see a young veterinary technician in his rural pharmacy. DSC01631 Originally uploaded by parisdelhi Coming back to the US can be damn hard. Once you are in the States, some wonderful feelings are felt but, no doubt, with the lack understanding ears, one can certainly become mildly and temporarily depressed. Finding the cultural continuity that I described in an earlier entry can be very helpful to recent Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs), but in the interest of fellow RPCVs I would mention the possibility of collaborating to launch a small project back in your Peace Corps country. As we know, one must have some very effective ways to insure correct use of funds but with strong contacts on the ground and in our world of cell phones and western union, I have found that possible. Designing and providing funds for a small beekeeping project has given me the opportunity to do something meaningful. I planned this project with two fellow community members from my Togolese village and did not launch it to keep my emotions up. I helped plan it because I believed in it. I believe that this project will be effective, and that it will not create dependence, given the way we designed it. Because I believe so strongly in the effectiveness of the project and that I am doing the right thing in implementing it, it has given me a mission when my overseas Peace Corps mission has just officially ended. This project has also made me feel present in my Togolese community and happy to still be a member of that community and an active participant in its welfare. I may no longer be a Peace Corps Volunteer but I am still and will always be an Affem Boussou community member. DSC_0046-2.jpg Originally uploaded by JCTownsley I just heard Cornel West say "Fetishism of commodities." He said "It is also among the destitute because the destitute have a fetishism of commodities, a fetishism of success [and think] 'all I need is success, and then somehow I am a better person.'" I think it is hard for Togolese to escape the "fetishism of commodities" as they peer out into the world through TVs and Radios and I think it is very connected to what the Ugandan Farmer Said in my last entry. He said "They shared a lot of things together...But now things have changed. Each person is on their own. A few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. They do not want to look like us." It is hard to not be a commodity fetisher in Togo as you learn of the rest of the world. And I believe the young generation will be heavily influenced by commodity fetishism but I also saw a lot of spiritually learned Muslims in Togo refuse commodity fetishism by emphasizing how fleeting and ephemeral earthly life is and how useless that makes attachment to money and things. A nomadic herder, himself a muslim, asked me, as I handed him money for taking me and my friends out in the bush with his cows, "Do you think the prize is down here [on earth] Kabirou? Forget about the money." That came from a man that can live on 20 dollars a month and to whom I was handing 30 dollars. His photo accompanies this entry. I have seen less of that mysticism and refusal of worldly goods in the Christian areas of Togo, but I spent less time there. It is hard for Togolese to escape the "Fetishism of commodities," in the the Commodity Fetisher Gala that is our world. That is sometimes hard to deal with as a Peace Corps volunteer who may have been able to join the Peace Corps in part because you have rejected commodity fetishism. You find that you and the Togolese are going in opposite directions, them toward and you away from commodities... The following two points of view get at a very sociological and anthropological aspect of "Development": How have Western fueled development and westward emigration affected home-grown development in Africa? Togo led me to ponder this question more and more as time went by. "Poverty has always been with us in our communities. It was here in the past, long before the Europeans came, and it affected many - perhaps all of us. But it was a different type of poverty. People were not helpless. They acted together and they never allowed it to squeeze any member of the community. They shared a lot of things together: hunting, grazing animals, harvesting. There was enough for basic survival. But now things have changed. Each person is on their own. A few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. They do not want to look like us." - Ugandan farmer cited in Voices of the Poor, by Deepa Narayan; Oxford University Press: 2000. On a very similar note, In a 2006 article entitled "OPEN THE BLINDS", now RPCV Dan Mueller tells us of a fictional African village that was developing at its own pace before the world started trying to develop Africa. It would seem that Mueller is saying that organic grassroots development is made impossible or improbable by the promise of the developed world driving up in a 4 x 4 and magically developing the village with money. That prospect drastically changes the rules of the game of getting ahead and tears apart the fabric of the developing society. Mueller continues, saying that the prospect of emigrating to the "developed" rich world and living the good life blinds Africans and leads them to forget the organic development that their ancestors, like ancestors all over the world, were engaged in. Mueller sees this state of affairs as being quite obvious to the observant development worker. Eid al-Adha in village Life back in the US has offered me two satisfying moments of craved Togolese and Muslim cultural continuity. The first moment was meeting two Togolese men who are originally from the area of Togo where I lived. They speak the language of Kotokoli that I learned to an intermediate level while in Togo. Speaking Kotokoli, with all of the cultural importance that is placed on certain subject matters and moments in communication, renders unto the last two and a half years of my life the feeling of richness that memories of those years deserve. Richness that, with no fault to anyone, dissipates like fog in the US context. The second moment of cultural continuity came when I went to Friday prayer at a mosque here in Oregon. There were small differences, none of the Muslim rosaries that were ubiquitous in Togolese mosques, folks were Middle Eastern and Eastern European instead of African, and the sermon, that spoke to God's view on interest or making money off money, made reference to the Western cultural context of being Muslim in the US, to the credit crisis, Plato, and the Catholic church. Not only did I agree with the sermon's message, that we must refuse to make money our first priority, but, as speaking Kotokoli did, the sermon and the prayer that followed rendered the memory of life in Togo full and rich. Living in the US, It is easy for my life in Togo to be drained of its meaning and utility like a motor of its oil. Moments of cultural continuity put oil back in my motor. A poster of Barack sold in Togolese markets Originally uploaded by parisdelhi The morning following the election of Barack Obama, I heard two themes in the reactions of Togolese: 1) This election is a lesson in meritocratic democracy and social equality. 2) This election represents the official removal of the glass ceiling that many assumed would always differentiate the place of blacks and the place of whites in the world. The election certainly proved everything that I had said to Togolese about my experience of America and about what I believed that America was. It was very nice to walk around an American in Africa for that reason and for the reason that my country had just accomplished the feat of making an expression of love and humanity be heard unmuffled. I was proud. I was disappointed, however, that many assumed that I would vote for John McCain but I understand that assumption. While giving a class in a Togolese middle school on the US election process and on the 2008 campaign, I asked the students who they would vote for. They responded that they would vote for Obama. I asked them why and they caught themselves and we laughed as they scurried to find policy reasons for voting Obama. When asked who I would vote for, I joked with the students that "of course I would vote for John McCain given my race." They understood that I was making the point that race or ethnicity should not determine who one votes for and we had another good laugh.
Dean's latest favorite toy - the ElliptiGO - is the basis for his attempt at the record books for "most distance covered on an elliptical bike in 5 days". He will be ellipting (?) his way down the coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a distance of over 500 miles. You can follow him here . I first saw the ElliptiGO at the Death Ride last year . Pretty cool that you can get the athletic benefit of an elliptical trainer while enjoying the outdoors. Here are some pics, courtesy of Eric C Gould : Leor Pantilat won for the 2nd year in a row (3:41:47), aided by a wrong turn by leader Geoff Roes (who still finished third in 3:51:51 ), and out-kicking Max King (2nd, 3:47:39). Joelle Vaught, who won in 2006, ran alone in first most of the race to win (4:13:53) after key rival Kami Semick dropped from stomach issues and flu-like symptoms. Bev Anderson-Abbs came in 2nd female/1st masters (4:29:40), a very strong performance just a few weeks after running a 50-miler, and Darcy Africa was 3rd&nbsp; (4:37:12). It's definitely worth reading the SacBee story and Leor's account to get a full picture of this great race in the mud. Or you can read the account from the man-sized banana at the Hwy 49 crossing. Congrats everyone! Many of us know 41-year-old Topher Gaylord as a seasoned ultrarunner, with finishes at UTMB, Western States, Top 10 at the Miwok 100k, 4th at the TNF Challenge 50-mile, and many others to his credit. A few of us may also know him from crewing for his speedy wife, Kim, or as the guy in the Race for the Soul movie who blew up and came back from the dead for a sub-24 hour finish. But did you also know he’s the President of Mountain Hardwear? Yup, as of this week. Free shwag for everyone! (ha, ha) Columbia Sportswear Company Announces Appointment of Topher Gaylord as President of Its Mountain Hardwear Subsidiary 20-year Outdoor Industry Veteran Brings Rich Global Brand-Building and Operational Experience March 01, 2010: 01:20 PM ET PORTLAND, Ore., March 1, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Columbia Sportswear Company (Nasdaq:COLM), a global leader in active outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment, announced today the appointment of Topher Gaylord as president of its wholly owned subsidiary Mountain Hardwear, Inc.

PERFORMANCE ELEVATED™. www.mountainhardwear.com &nbsp; Yesterday I had the great pleasure of joining 200 runners for the Caumsett State Park 50k in Lloyd Harbor, NY, put on by New York Ultra Running . As the USATF 50k Road Championships, lots of speed demons were out to enjoy one of the first sunny days to come after a long, hard northeast winter. What better way than a 10 lap loop course with fellow ultra warriors? As I warmed up with Team Inov-8 runner Ben Nephew , we agreed that the day had a lot the right ingredients for a breakthrough PR. Although the temp was in the high 30's, the sun would warm up the day to ideal low 50's by the halfway point. Short of some wind gusts, this was MUCH better than snow/sleet/sub-zero Caumsett 50k's of the past. Plus there were a lot of great runners here - 2x defending champ and course record holder (2:56) Michael Wardian , Scott Jaime (pronounced Hi-Me) from Colorado, 50k Masters American Record holder Dan Verrington , 24-hour American Record holder Mark Godale , 24-hour National Team member Phil McCarthy, Montrail runners Annette Bednosky and Jill Perry , the great Scott Jurek, and a half dozen more that could go sub-3:30 on a good day. I felt like a kid meeting my favorite rock stars! &nbsp; (Ben Nephew and I sport the new Team Inov-8 shirts) &nbsp; (Staying warm at the start) My personal goal for the day was to improve on my 50k PR (3:37 at the 2009 Ruth Anderson 50k ). My speed work was going INSANELY well over the last three months, particularly by teaching me that I could be in a lot of pain and still hold my form. To achieve a PR, like any stretch goal, you need three things. First, you need to show up (check). I know that sounds simple, but as we all know, getting the start line healthy and ready can be tough. Second, you need the opportunity, like a day of perfect weather and runners faster than you (check). Third, you need to believe that it is possible to achieve something beyond your best (check, thank you speedwork). Let's DO THIS! At 8:30am, Suffolk County Legislator Jon Cooper sent off the 50k runners (30 minutes ahead of the 25k runners) and the front pack quickly spread out. Wardian, Jesse Regnier (in his first race beyond 8 miles), and 2:19 marathoner Malcolm Campbell went out hard, running 5:30 min/miles. Scott Jaime and Malcolm Campbell each ran solo at a sub-6 pace a few steps back, and Dan Verrington, Ben Nephew, Mark Godale and I clocked 6 min./miles in the next chase pack. Dan was doing most of the work in our pack, letting us know right up front that he was shooting for "3 and low teens since the 45-49 50k American Record is soft at 3:17". I guess he would know - it's his record! We finished the first lap in 18 minutes. My God, this was fast. &nbsp; (Mark Godale, Ben Nephew, and Dan Verrington chasing Scott Jaime) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Michael Wardian and Jesse Raginer finish up lap #1) We got sight of the Womens race on the out and back section, and front runners Annette Bednosky, Jill Perry, and Yolanda Flamino were sticking close to each other. Last years champ and course record holder, Kami Semick, was not present today so it was anyone's race. They were all keeping each other in sight. &nbsp; (Jill Perry leads Annette Bednosky and Yolanda Flamino) Ben Nephew was nice enough to help pace the pack with Dan, but around lap 3 (mile 9) Dan picked up the pace charging the uphill grades and dropped us. Mark Godale fell off the pace, and Ben and I speculated that he probably wasn't in peak shape thanks to daughter #3 recently arriving. We both had 3-year-olds and knew how that could crimp a training plan, but #3? Fuggetaboutit. &nbsp; (Scott Jaime gives a thumbs up) On each subsequent lap, we molted layers of hats, gloves, sleeves, wool, etc. until we were down to our tank tops in the 45-degree air. Ben continued to do the lion's share of the pacing, running with a short and powerful stride from all his snowshoeing. I was nursing a sore shoulder from a sex-related injury (best if I don't provide detail on that one, but let me recommend that you stretch out before ANY strenuous exercise), but otherwise feeling strong. The aid station volunteers at both stops were amazing, and we barely had to slow for whatever we needed. On lap 6 (mile 18), my body demanded a bio break and I made a absurdly efficient 20-second stop at the port-a-potty. Ben wished me well, and from that point on he would be little more than a dot on the horizon. That was okay though - I knew the last third was going to be a three-night stay in the House of Pain, and it felt proper to venture into that valley of darkness alone. &nbsp;(Local ultrarunners not obeying the speed limit) I wasn't alone, however, since thanks to the loop format I got to see EVERYONE. The New York Ultra Runners were having a great day and making the most of the early signs of Spring. I exchanged atta-boys with 78-year-old Sam Soccoli from North Babylon, NY, and the famous Roy Pirrung who was defying his 62-year-old age with a sub-5 hour pace. 70-old Patricia Delaney was also making good time, and always had a smile on. They sure breed 'em tough out here! At Lap 8, I hit the marathon mark in 2:48 (almost a PR!) and fought desperately to hold my form. Michael Wardian gave a few words of encouragement as he lapped me, slowing but still on course record pace. At the turnaround, I could see that Dan Verrington had passed Scott Jaime, but Scott was keeping him in sight. Ben was still holding on strong and was about a minute ahead of me now. The Womens race found Yolanda Flamino in front after dropping the hammer on lap 3 and gapping the other women by a good 15 minutes. Annette Bednosky, however, was picking up speed in one of her classic negative split finishes. &nbsp; (Ben Nephew keeps cranking) As I entered Lap 10, my stomach knotted up, my head started spinning, and my muscles began twitching like crazy. My pace had slowed to a 7 minute mile as I walked the two aid stations to try and get more liquids in. The pain. My God, the pain! I could feel my heartbeat in the back of my eyeballs. But as the mile markers reminded me, this was almost over. Annette was kind enough to pick up the pace and run along with me until the last 1/2 mile, and I gave it everything. I crossed the finish in 3:20:48, good enough for 6th overall. &nbsp;(Mark Godale and Dan Verrington talk about the race) I laughed out loud as I crossed the finish line. Did that just happen? Did I just take 17 minutes off my PR? Either the training is going well, or I have been seriously sandbagging for a long time now. As I spoke with the other finishers, it turns out many of them had breakthrough days. Michael Wardian (2:55) had beat his previous record by 40 seconds, with Malcolm Campbell (3:04) getting second with a great performance. Scott Jaime (3:13) had passed Dan Verrington (3:15) to claim third and the Masters win, but Dan set a new 45-49 age group American Record in the process. Ben was quite pleased with his 3:18 best on this course, and Mark Godale charged in the last laps to finish a few minutes behind me. Jesse Raginer clocked a 3:28 in his first 50k - not bad at all! &nbsp;(2010 Womens 50k Road National Champion, Yolanda Flamino) (Scott Jaime gets the Masters payday from RD Amy Goldstein) Yolanda Flamino won the Womens division in 3:34, with Annette Bednosky (3:43) taking second and winning the Masters division in a time well under her goal. Jill Perry (3:47) fought through some tough spots to hold onto third. ( full results ) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Scott Jurek, me, and 2010 50k Road National Champion, Michael Wardian) &nbsp; (Sporting the hardware with 3rd place Womens finisher Jill Perry) I felt like an Olympian with all my medals (a gorgeous finisher medal, a USATF medal for 6th overall and a USATF medal for 2nd in 40-44), and was tickled to get the $50 check for third Master. Paydays are rare in this sport! My thanks to RD Amy Goldstein, her wonderful volunteers and sponsors, Howard Nippert and the crew at USATF, and the nice folks of Long Island for putting on a great race. Thanks to the opportunity, assistance, and support you provided, I had a breakthrough day! &nbsp; (Schwag overload! I'm in heaven...) Michele Wallace from the San Diego News wrote a fun article about Mike and Kim Rouse, a couple who (somehow) gets along while training for ultras, Ironmans, and even the Ultraman. I love their quotes about each other - it's truly a match made in heaven! You can read the whole article here . &nbsp; (Photo courtesy of poet Ollie Lind ) Have you ever noticed that half of the stories in endurance magazines sound like Mad Libs for people in recovery? Sometimes I swear they just plug in the facts: " [Name] got into running after recovering from [near-fatal disease or accident] just [random number] years ago. "I was in bed, feeling sorry for myself, [another random number] pounds overweight, and my [body part] looked like [bad food or construction analogy] . I decided the best way to beat [near-fatal disease or accident] was to celebrate the health I had one day at a time. I trained for months and completed [major race] . I'm not embarrassed about my [body part] since it gives me a chance to educate others about [near-fatal disease or accident] . I've now hooked up with [charity of near-fatal disease or accident] to run more, and hope to inspire others with [near-fatal disease or accident] and be living proof it is possible to overcome." Unfortunately it's easy to gloss over the message in these formulaic summaries. In truth, there is something very powerful at the heart of these tales. This is Part II of my long run revelations: "To lead a ful
illed life, embrace death." I've had the good fortune of losing some friends and family in the last six months. I know that sounds backwards, since the pain and loss that immediately accompanies such devastation is soul-crushing. But by embracing loss and authentically internalizing the myriad of feelings that surround it, life feels more precious. Life IS more precious. If we are living, we are survivors. We should all embrace life as fully as our formulaic heroes. It's such a shame that most of us can easily avoid our own finality in day-to-day routine, distracting media, and pharmacologically-enhanced lives. Comfort is good, and probably necessary for some level of sanity, but it's important to regularly remind yourself not to take it all for granted. I often feel this is the reason many of us enter endurance events and push our personal limits - we surround ourselves in pain and adventure so thick that we can't escape asking ourselves the very basic questions of what makes us happy, what makes us tick, and what gives life meaning. Through the pain, we grow, and for days afterward, we cherish every breath, every sunset, and every laugh. At the 2009 Western States, I got so deep it got scary . But the serenity that followed lasted for weeks, even months, and was nothing short of life-changing. If 27+ hours on the trail is all it takes to reach that level of enlightenment and peace, it may very well have been the easiest thing I have ever done. Embrace your finality. Treasure the moments you have. See life in its fullest hue. It's the best way to honor those who left before you, and makes for MUCH better stories. - SD [You can also read Long Run Revelations, Part I - There Is No Such Thing As Work/Life Balance, Only Life Balance ] I've recently seen a large increase in traffic to this blog from blogger.com, meaning more and more bloggers are following me. Great to have you! Just in case it's helpful, I thought I would share a few tips picked up from analyzing traffic over the last few months. We all have different goals for blogging, and it's totally fine if you don't ever analyze your traffic or try to boost your readership. But I will say once you start looking into it, you will be surprised how many people are connecting to your insights. Here a few quick and simple ways to boost your traffic: 1) Use an analytics service . Wonder how I knew about the increase in traffic from blogger.com? My analytics service helped me track it. If you aren't using one, I would suggest you do. Most of these services are free - StatCounter and Google Analytics being two of my favorites - and will start giving you fascinating data immediately after you add a few lines of code to your template or add a widget. Imagine being able to see who sends the most traffic, which search words bring people to your site, and how folks navigate your blog. This week my top referral sites were run100s.com (Stan Jensen's encyclopedic site on ultrarunning), wikipedia (largely on Dean Karnazes inquiries), and forum.somethingawful.com (from a forum conversation that linked to toenail removal), and my top search terms were "caballo blanco", "coconut water", and "cross country championships". It's a fascinating time suck. ;-) Once you get some analytics, a few of these other suggestions will make sense. 2) Add the LinkWithin widget . If you look at the bottom of my blog entry, you'll see a thing that suggests other blog posts you might like. That's LinkWithin , and it's a very simple free widget to add. On average, it has increased my traffic 18% without having to do a thing. But more importantly, it helps convert a lot of first time visitors into reading 2-3 pages. Odds are a few of them will be more regular readers. 3) Bring on the pics ! Behind Google, my #2 contributor of traffic is images.google.com. This is from people looking for pictures of trail running, parks, people, etc., and has continuously been one of the big attractors of new readers to my blog. You can help Google figure out what your pictures are about with some clever image naming, such as "2009_xterra_trail_running_world_championship_hawaii_max_king_winning.jpg". Think about how many image searches might hit that - xterra, max king, hawaii trail running, etc. - especially over time. I've found a direct correlation to the number of pictures in a blog entry, and the number of visitors over time. Basically you can't ever have too many and if you name the images correctly, they will pull readers in for years to come. On the flip side, I recently tried out "Snapshots", a widget that popped up a pre-link window that did not do much for traffic so I turned it off. I've also added "recent comments" on the right, but haven't seen a noticeable change in traffic. But I find it useful, so I will leave it up a bit longer. Got a great tip? Let me hear it! It's how we all get better. Thx, SD Olympians and all-around running superstars Dathan Ritzenheim and Shalane Flanagan dominated the USA Cross Country Championships in Spokane, WA, this weekend. This was Dathan's third and Shalane's fourth national cross country title. &nbsp;(Dathan Ritzenhein, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Joining Dathan (34:34 for 12k) on the national team are Minnesotan Patrick Smyth (34:52), Chico, CA's Scott Bauhs (35:01), fellow Eugene, OR runner Ben Bruce (35:16), Admore, PA's Bobby Curtis (35:22), and Gresham, OR's Ryan Vail (35:25). &nbsp;(Shalane Flanagan, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Shalane (25:10 for 8k) led by 51 seconds, with 10k superstar Molly Huddle (26:01), Flagstaff, AZ's Amy Hastings (26:09), Olympian Magdelena Lewy Boulet (26:09), Boulder's Rene Metivier Baillie (26:26), and Mammoth Lake, CA's Sara Hall (26:27) rounding out the team.

Apparent Dip is thrilled and profoundly happy to announce that my endorsement of Barack Obama for president appears to have worked, tipping the balance in crucial states, and leading to an overwhelming victory for Barack Obama.I am unfortunately listening to television pundits try to sound profound right now. John McCain gave a fantastic concession speech, I am glad he did not speak like that during the campaign, I feel the contest would have been much closer.Time to watch his acceptance speech!

Simon takes the best pictures, so I am always stealing them-forgive me, Simon. Before the journal entry, here is an MP3 for the reader. An Excerpt from an Unpublished August Journal: Once upon a time I stood on a street corner and peered into the canal, thinking that it was just as good a reason as any for living. Certainly, I formed an analogy between its flowing water and my own blood, reflecting once again upon the minimal difference between that which is within us and that which is without (is there not a fantastic sameness in both form and function when considering trees and the lungs of animals?). The powdered pinkness of the dying sun reflected in the water, the approaching ivory-on-saphire army of midnight swans, poised for majesty and intimidation, the ghostly cleaning boat of yesteryear, surrounded by its cloud of steam and guided only by a few piercing bright lights: these are the images that force one to remain motionless on the bridge, afraid to budge for fear of missing one valuable second. 'Rage, rage, against the dying day...' For as long as I can remember, I have wished to hold images close to me, as though they were tangible objects. For a time, I believed this to be harmful or foolish, a fetishistic act of consumption useful only for the continual harvest of an insatiable hunger. But now I understand the way in which this reorganization of life informs my happiness; I call it Magical Realism. When I was a teenager I lived solely in a place of magical realism. At some point I have been each and every one of my great heroes, a cause to which I remained dedicated regardless of whether or not another person was present to verify the occurrence. The first few times I allowed others to pass into my private realm were common but necessary, images so familiar they might have been plucked from any coming of age biopic-reading aloud from the Ginsberg anthology, enthusiasm fueled by stolen warm champagne, cross legged on the black cushion, youth tuned into youth (a concentration permitted only by the suspension of worry available in those days), giving finally a small performance of I Shall Be Released... The morning after such exploits, when I climbed the hill near my parent's house and sat staring into the rising sun, its ageless puddle of light slowly engulfing every branch and stone, I had effectively transcended time. There was no great stopwatch separating myself from my heroes, for the experience of self-realization and initial discovery is always a virgin entity; its ability to repeat itself yet always be different lies in its being the definition of newness. The only absolute newness is creation. As a creator of music, I sometimes forget what it is like to experience music from an entirely non-critical point of view. So, what does this mean for me, Berlin and the life blood canal that once extended before my eyes? It is arguable that all the wandering souls of the world (people like myself) have inherited Christopher Isherwood's haunted, candlelit land of eccentric intellectuals and cabaret shows and morphed it into an aimless place of hedonism and anti-everything logic, but really, it just depends on how you see it. If I can, for just one minute, block out the chattering buzz of the millions of technological advances that demand such an unending life force (phones, the internet, the ever-present flash of digital cameras), then I am left only with the advancing army of swans, the pink water, the beautiful memory of the ex-Soviet bar, competing musical instruments drifting into consciousness from afar... In this moment, Rosie is Sally Bowles and I am Bryan Roberts, and when I get home, she will be there, "dolled up for Easter." Thoughts from the Present: So, many miles from Berlin, I am giving myself over to music again; this is my aim and my wish. Lost in a little village of guitar feedback and drum machines, I ponder the separation between the man and the music, the world and the single voice, the unceasing flow and the magic quality of a single moment. Thrills, spills, mistakes, regrets, reflections, and most importantly, things to be thankful for, paint my vision in a rather kaleidoscopic manner, light refracting through a crystal lattice work. All the cities drift by, among them the seven hills of Lisbon, the unrelenting stone facade of Bushwick, the dark retro bars of St. Pauli, the mountain and warm cheese in Mexico, and of course, the chalky rose canal that carried me through Berlin, across the ocean and directly into this moment-this moment, in which I am forced to remember how much magic has truly transpired. Here I must digest all of this magic, allow it to dissipate among my cells, forming a lightning-fast network of electrical energy. Slowly, it quells my anxiety and gets to work taking my little place of magical realism-the attic in Wimpole Street, the blue bulb of the stage light, the love affair with a guitar-from fantasy to the other side. And so, once again, a handprint is stamped across time. Nico - I'll Keep It With Mine MP3 Photograph by Martin Parr, from "The Last Resort." Today I had a good feeling. Having planned to meet my friends from Hamburg, Sonja and Niki, for a rare combination of sustenance and culture, I walked out my front door, turned right, and traced the almost straight line to the Samaritestrasse U-Bahn station. Before I could reach my final destination, Oranienburger strasse, I was required to make two changes, one at Alexanderplatz, and another at Friedrichstrasse. Normally, such a circuitous route would spark in me some form of anxiety (I tend to be unnecessarily short tempered when traversing the urban landscape) but today I didn't mind. In fact, the whole process transcended me as though by some divine intervention, and while I was making the first change at Alexanderplatz I experienced the wonderful (see how it has been upgraded from good to wonderful) feeling of which I earlier spoke. The feeling was this: for the first time since moving to Berlin, I was not conscious of where I was or where I was going; my thoughts were elsewhere-perhaps I was mentally reviewing a new piece of music, or possibly just reviewing the vacuous space that was beginning to fill my stomach region-but either way, I certainly was not forcing myself to be continuously critical of my every move. There's a certain self-consciousness, a kind of continual embarrassment, that goes along with being a new person in any place. You have sense that, at any given moment, every capable citizen is watching you, secretly laughing at your every misstep. But today I was just a piece of the machine, an ordinary gear in the ever-expansive clock of human interaction. Sometimes it's nice to be part of a machine, it just has to be the right one. I arrived early, and spent about thirty minutes in the park, watching the sun's angle decline, appreciating the fact that I was using this civic gift just as it was intended to be used: reading, watching, depositing my cigarette ash in the ashtray provided for me by the government, understanding how parks act as little puddles of serenity, placed evenly around a city to balance out the madness. Parks are almost living proof that everyone, even those in charge, is aware that life is more stressful than it needs to be. After lunch, we filed into the Martin Parr exhibition. I don't know how much you know about Martin Parr, but before today I knew absolutely nothing. The briefing I had received (from my friend Moritz) was that his work focuses mainly on the grotesque contrasts/contradictions of modern Western society, both at home and in areas of reduced financial prosperity. It is often the work of juxtaposition: statues of the Virgin Mary underneath a McDonald's awning, British tourists stuffing their faces at a Belgian holiday resort surrounded by garbage, sun-bleached couples seemingly miserable on a crowded ocean front. Interestingly enough, there were quite a few photographs of Glasgow, which is obviously of great interest to me. Some, I did think, were particularly harrowing, specifically the photo of the men's barber shop, the walls of which were entirely covered with images of naked women. However, there were certain photographs that did not fill me with any sense of disgust. I remember, very specifically, a photograph which portrays a Glasgow street, one where most of the buildings have been demolished and thus there remains only one or two tenements, one or more of their sides exposed. In the foreground of the image one can see a Tennents beer sign, indicating the door to a pub. Obviously, the idea is that, amongst such urban desolation, the most popular escape is liquid mental abandon in an aesthetically-impoverished setting, but when I saw this, the first thought that flashed into my mind was, Sometimes life just looks like that. I lived in Glasgow for three and a half years, and although I was a) a foreigner, and thus, in some ways, a tourist, and b) living in a very nice part of Glasgow, I still lived there, and I still frequented quite a few places that didn't look entirely unlike this one. Glasgow has a kind of grit and I don't think it's something to be ashamed of. During my time there, I picked up on an almost beautiful force, a simultaneous wisdom and madness that allows the people there to be drawn so close to each other, a sort of universal refuge under all that grey brick and grey sky. It is my belief that, an image such as the one I have described, is totally ignorant of that positive energy. Two other images really captivated me. The first was of an elderly woman wearing a white cap and orthopedic shoes, eating alone in a McDonalds, hunched over the table. Even as I'm describing it now, it's nearly bringing tears to my eyes. I have knowingly done any number of things to destroy my body (drinking, smoking, whatever...), but this woman, why is she doing this? It's one thing to see a younger person eating a processed hamburger but it's entirely different when you see an elderly woman carrying out the same act. All I can think is that, either she doesn't know any better, or it's the only option she can afford, which brings me to my next thought: Why the fuck do fast food companies make this shit available to people?! Yeah, consumers have a choice, but all people, especially those in the business of distributing food products, must be perfectly aware that not all are consumers are equally educated, and thus they knowingly provide the crutch for susceptible eaters. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are also really bad for you, and often a crutch, but they're fucking illegal, aren't they? I don't know why the powers that be, or people in general (who I suppose are the powers that be) are not bothered by this image of lonely old woman hunched over a styrofoam plate. I just keep imagining that it's my grandmother, who lived as a widow for the last forty years of her life, sat by herself in a soulless plastic box of a restaurant, thinking to herself, Life is so unfair. It fucking breaks my heart. The second image which caught my eye is one which depicts a slew of tourists at a Brighton beach resort, waiting to get to the front of a fast food queue. It is somewhat of an action/motion shot, causing the majority of depicted individuals to appear blurred. However, in complete focus, at the far right of the shot, stands a boy of somewhere between eleven and thirteen years, his right arm akimbo as he stares thoughtfully out of the frame and into the present. The remarkable thing about this boy is that he has the face and complete composure of a grown man. Not the facial hair and wrinkles, or course, but rather the sense of understanding and inherent wisdom. During my time as a pre-school teacher, I noticed this trait in some of my students. The viewing of this phenomenon always fills me with a mixed sense of wonder, admiration and sadness, for in some ways, to understand too much too young is a hindrance. Does this boy remember the day the photograph was taken? What was he thinking about? The photograph is from 1985. He must be in his mid thirties by now. As he walks the streets of whichever British town or city in which he resides, does he still have that same glaze of guaranteed assurance? Does he think to himself, I've got the answer-I've always had the answer? And on the day the photograph was taken did he surmise that it was grotesque, that he was grotesque, that the whole situation of Western capitalism was, for all intents and purposes, grotesque? Fat. Ugly. Unhealthy. Probably not, he probably just accepted that day as it happened, for that's how we live, isn't it? An image is capable of highlighting, later on, an essence that was present all the time, but went unnoticed. Its power resides in its retrospective quality. And I suppose that's why Carr's work, or any artist's work is important, even if it sometimes neglects the fullness of the human experience: Be part of the machine, enjoy and accept the things around you, but don't forget, once and a while, to stop and criticize. I've just returned from Glasgow, where I've finished up a recording with members of Michael Dracula, Belle and Sebastian, Mother and the Addicts, and obviously, myself. I'm quite pleased with it. Not sure when it will be finished, if ever. The song was recorded at Green Door Studios. In other news, I've relocated to Berlin, I'm not sure for what, some sort of inspiration no doubt, so if anybody is kicking about and wants to hang out or play music or whatever, please drop me a line. I'm ready to restart, rewrite, re-everything. No more fear, no more holding back, time for brilsolage. PLUS.... this pink chair in my sublet is BLOODY FANTASTIC. Love, Ramesh Novicat de Soeurs Missionaires de Notre Dame d'Afrique & four religious drummers - Yesu Ka Mkwebase MP3 Dear Lacey, I was busy writing about something else, the loss of innocence and all this kind of shit, when I was suddenly distracted by your memory, or rather the memory of you, and thought that perhaps it would be better if I just wrote you instead. I believe it's because I was writing about high school, that miserable place which afforded us little more education than the camaraderie and independence that grew up inside of us, partially the product of choice, partially the product of necessity, that shared closeness that comes with the experience of being a social outsider. More specifically, I was recalling the bit of forest behind the school, the one we were never meant to visit, past the portable classrooms and pick up trucks, and that horrendous chain-link fence, the one which separates truancy from athletic participation. There's something really beautiful about that piece of land, that delicate fabric of trails and open fields which reminds you, if only for a second, that perhaps central Texas is not the worst place on Earth, a beauty which is no doubt enhanced by its forbidden quality. I'm sure it was you who made me go there first, or maybe it was Courtney. I can never be sure. You were always forcing me to do stuff like that, to bend rules, to push boundaries, not so much because you were a junior revolutionary, but more because you had the foresight to understand that these temporary rules enact
d to govern the lives of young adolescents are, really and truly, complete and utter shit. Like the time you convinced me to ditch the career fair, and we spent the whole day mucking around South Austin; you bought me a sandwich, and then we rolled our pants up, halved a piece of cake, and climbed carefully but deftly down the root-encrusted bank to the still and forgotten creek behind the sandwich shop. I might not be pushing it if I said that was one of the best days of my life. Yes, that's what I remember-little moments of freedom. I think we were quite good at that, our little group. We attended school in a place where it is customary to see Confederate flags, where the term "faggot" is thrown around with little to no objection, and where unconditional praise of the athletically gifted is encouraged (all typical traits of the southern experience, but one has to remember that it's disturbing that these things should ever become normalized). And so, in our own futile rebellion, we ate our lunches outside under the trees, sported our montage of paisley retro gear, pinstriped vests, and Goodwill t-shirts, celebrated Bob Dylan's birthday with chocolate cake at seven in the morning, and generally tuned out the world by filling our ears with music that was long ago forgotten by many-or so I thought at the time. Of course this is a regular occurrence, that feeling of togetherness which is born out of isolation, but I like to think there was something a bit different about our situation -it wasn't identifiable as any nationwide youth trend, but it was instead a bond colored by a complete and total obsession with the past, a fundamental belief that things were inherently cooler in the sixties. And they were. The first week of school, I didn't even know you, but I knew you enough to think that I was in love with you. And then, with minimal provocation, you agreed to sew onto my bag all the patches which I had collected over the summer-The Grateful Dead, Jim Morrison, The Beatles, Bob Marley... The most obvious characters of retro obsession, which at that point, for me, held no cultural association of mainstream taboo. Yours was the most finite stitching I had ever seen, so evenly spaced, and with all the patches placed at angles that allowed them to exist in perfect harmony. As soon as I held the now-transformed vessel in my hand, I knew that I was definitely in love with you, and always would be. Maybe that's the benefit of going to school in the middle of nowhere: the popular trends take longer to reach you, the only norm is mainstream country music, so you have to find something on your own, something that moves you and gives you shelter from your incongruous environment, the one that, as somebody quite clever once said, "says nothing to me about my life." There is one event that I remember quite vividly, sticks out in my mind, a party held on your mother's land, just across the creek from your father's, in that magical nowhere dip where the only signs of life were the distant silhouettes of cows, presumably in place for tax purposes. On this particular night, we had managed to craft something of truly Kesey-esque proportions: Everything in my memory is shrouded in the flickering of several campfire lights, brief flashes of beards and naked skin, the competing strums of acoustic guitars, the kids from the neighboring school (namely your boyfriend and his team of beautiful hooligans) with their Kent III shirts, converse and gas station wine situated at the opposite flame, the constant sound of didgeridoos (by this point, the Alaskans had arrived and firmly planted themselves on your land and in your heart), and last but not least the incredible image of Courtney channeling Mountain Girl, wandering from person to person, offering each friend a poem from a jar, which had been folded into a pyramid shape (the poem, not the jar). "A poem for you..." That night, as David and I were ascending from the wilderness and back into my car, I remember turning around for one last look at the circle below of fire, bodies, and drone, and remarking to David that it looked exactly like a National Geographic special, a fitting description, for earlier that week, you and I had fought because you assured me that, if given the choice, you would abandon all things familiar and Western, and relocate to a specific Aboriginal tribe where a popular game included forming a large circle with linked arms, consistently altering the resulting shape so as to avoid being touched by the shade of an overhead cloud. In this moment I believed that, maybe, just maybe, you were being sincere. Just as well, then, that you left us for Alaska, left school early to pursue something that, all in all, was far more worthwhile. Sometimes I can't escape thinking that perhaps your decision to follow those bearded Alaskans up into the wilderness meant you knew that you were to die young. Although, I think everybody once and a while believes they are to die young, at least I hope that's a universal premonition, otherwise I should be concerned. Sometimes I try to imagine all the events I missed while I was sweeping away at the cinema: the day you cut off your, long, famous hair, the endless paths carved through such esoteric towns as Moab, Utah in pursuit of that great, northern paradise, the hours spent studying the teachings of a Western guru, and lastly the days spent in that cabin alone in Alaska, trying to understand, as you said to me, your relationship with God. But there are things I do remember, things I don't have to imagine, like the many trips down to the University in search of several spoonfuls of bohemian insight, all of us lying in wait in my heavily shrouded bedroom, unanimously dreading the possibility that any parent might arrive before my father's decaying cassette copy of "Sounds of Silence" had come to completion. Or an evening spent in my now-donated Mercedes (used, of course); eyes closed as the song I'd written for you surged from the speakers, through my body, and eventually from my left hand into your right, all but filling the dense yet awkward-less silence. And then, of course, the last time I saw you. You were leaving for Alaska or I was leaving for Europe, I can't remember which. That evening I was closing down the theater, clad in maroon vest and nylon necktie. I met you in the parking lot for a hurried goodbye (sometimes that's the only thing available). Standing outside in the vast space between the bookstore and the cinema entrance, one of us (I can't remember which) said, "I don't know when I'll see you again," and the other replied, "It doesn't matter," not as an indication of apathy, but instead a reminder that deep-rooted love is something you carry with you, like a talisman, or rather like that essential piece of metal sewn into the wall of my stomach lining. "Even when I'm not with you, my love is with you..." Each year, on the anniversary of your death, I intend to write something and never do, a disservice I always regret. Instead, I'd like to remind you of something you wrote, something I had forgotten about until I saw your father at David's funeral the other day. There is more to say about David, but nothing you don't know, and now is not the time or place. He (your father) said to me that it's finally time to begin taking apart your room, to free himself of the many possessions left behind in that upstairs purple abode. As a start on the project of purging, I was handed a package containing photographs of you and David (I had forgotten how the two of you looked so much like identical twins), along with a story you'd written for school when we were fourteen or so, detailing where you might be in ten years. I stored these items somewhere safe (so safe I can't remember the exact location) and thus I am unable to quote your original text. But here's what I can remember-I can remember the rough penmanship, the sort that can only belong to a girl of fourteen, and I can remember the happiness that it brought me years ago when first I glimpsed it, a happiness which was rekindled when it was re-delivered to me much later. Fortunately I can also remember the general outline of my favorite part. It had something to do with you joining NASA, training to become an astronaut and traveling to the moon several times. After that vision of yours was quenched, you married me, we had three beautiful children, and I like to think that we lived happily ever after. If you'd only known how, at the time, I carried this story inside of me, intentionally ignorant of its casual intent, and allowed it to foster all kinds of beautiful hopes within my being. But maybe it wasn't all disingenuous. As we discussed earlier, love is something that you carry with you always, regardless of its form. So many years later, all I can say is this: I'm glad this was your dream-because it was mine too. Love, Ramesh It's incredible to think of all of us out there in the world who want nothing more than to rest a head against a foreign body, passing each other in the street, continuing on with the same little empty space tucked somewhere deep inside. But it's all relative. I don't even need to elaborate upon why my concern of loneliness is partially ridiculous. Famine, hunger... these are much worse, and perhaps with my little plea I'm tempting the Gods of true loneliness. Let's hope not. That's the thing- sometimes I feel like a spoiled fucking brat because I have a shell-shocked attitude regarding the things that surround me on a daily basis. I don't care about record reviews. I don't care about the internet. I don't care about the relative popularity of other similar bands who, apparently, the internet has told me I should view as competition. I care about writing music. I care about people, and they're getting harder and harder to hold close to me, or perhaps even to grasp in the first place. Maybe it's because I'm lonely. Maybe it's because I'm hungover. Maybe it's because I came to the most beautiful city in the world and couldn't make it work. I wanted to relive that magical morning of my life with the marlboro lights and the window and the stack of NMEs. Sometimes I get really scared because I don't care about anything, and that's just fucking stupid because in the moments where it's all seemed on the brink of loss I've never been more afraid. It's those seconds where you realize that you don't make your own rules that really shake you up. When I get this way I have to comfort myself with the fact that I have music in my life. Music understands the fact that I run through life too fast and expect everything to happen instantly. I'm just going to give myself to the stage, go into hiding and write something great, bounce around and kick my feet and scream and strum and scream and strum... Twee as fuck: Here is a "synchronized" routine we devised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Check Matt (Favourite Sons)'s solo at the end. I've just fully realized that our album actually comes out tomorrow. That's really exciting. Today, we're filming our first music video, which is a process I had never even thought possible. Watching people film in double time is amazing! The video is for Firecracker, which I've decided is my favorite song on the record, along with Real Live Version (a song written for Judee Sill-it's supposed to sound like that) and Blood Red Blood. Or at least those are the songs whose outcome reached their initial intentions the best... This Friday we start our tour, which continues for about five weeks, a daunting prospect but fun nonetheless. It's interesting, this process we've been going through recently of having to bring the songs from the record into the live set. It was nice doing a bit of experimenting with sound when making the record, but I suppose the trick is figuring how to give the songs an equal amount of live energy as their counterparts. At least in Austin and New York, we have Tosca on our side and that's never a bad thing! Hope to see you soon. Love, Ramesh
As we left the catacombs, we thought Benadrix was struck ill.  He collapsed and his breathing came in short gasps. He quickly recovered and told us he had a vision, he could not remember much, but he said he felt anger and saw red. He also thought that he may have glimpsed a dragon. These visions that guide my new friend interest me, I was tought by my dwarven friends the importance of follwoing my own will, but even they hope for visions from Moradin to guide them. How different is that from the guidance of the Mind Flayers? I will not worry myself with it, for now these strange events surrounding Harken are enough. We went to the Old Cliffside Brewery on our return to town, as we had assume we found Old Keller there along with Orek Gernsan, the ranger who we had met was not present.  Both men seemed suprised to see us walk through the door.  We told them how we had routed the goblins, and what we had found in the catacombs, and more importnatnly to Gernsan what we didn't find, his shipments.  Overjoyed and true to his word, Keller paied us the 100 gold promised us the night before.   We spent some time talking to Keller, trying to gather as much information as we could.  So far no villagers have gone missing, and when we told him that the goblins were tied th the Bloodreavers he was not supprised.  It appears Chieg Krand and his Bloodreavers make their home north of Harken, and have been less than desirable neighbors.   We retired to the Inn for the evening.  Aunt Nonie was as supprised to see us return alive as Keller and Gernsan were, she had held our rooms for us, but not her breath.  Before retiering for the evening we agreed once more that we would return to the catacombs in the morning. After a hearty breakfast (for my companions) we headded out to the catacombs, there was no end to the teasing of Benadrix and his feat of streangth with the statue and his inablilty to break down a wooden door.  As we approched the catacombs, two goblins were exiting.  When they saw us they broke for the woods.  We went to make chace but from the forrest exploded a huge black dog, and almost as quickly it burst into smoke.  Moments after the dog vanished an elf woman appeared fromt he brush.  She asked if we had seen a man go this way, she seemed very confused.  We tried to explain to her that the only thing we had going this direction was the dog who dissapeared, but taht we too were on the chase, after two goblins.   She contenued to insist a man had gon this way, and kept repeating a name "Garrek Esh."  After a few minutes of trying we callemd the elf down, and attempted to get her story one more time.  Her name is Cellence, and she is from Sigil the city of portals.  The man she is perusing, this Garrek, has escaped from some sort of prison she called the Harbinger House.  Most of this was lost to me, I had never heard of any of these places, but Marrek seemed to know a little.  His reaction to hearing she came from Sidgil was one of suprise, his knowlegd of it seemed to mosty come from children's stories he was told while growing up.  Knowing the magic nature of Sigil Marrek suggested Cellence should make her way to Thunderspire, a nearby city ruled by wizards.  Cellence asked to accompany us until she found her bearings in our world, aparently taking the portals out of Sidgil is very disorenting. Cellence accompanied us into the catacombs, there was no more signs of goblin activity.  We made our way into the chamber with the pit and locked door.  After a night of rest Gnasc was able to pick the lock on the door.  Inside we found a magic sword, being two handed it was deemed appropreat for Benadrix to carry it.  Perhaps it will serve as a reminder to him next time that his feats of strength should be resurved for locked doors rather than pushing statues into pits.  We removed the debre blocking the other door and followed it into a large underground cavern with a lake in the middle.   We were supprised by some bats, and it took us a moment to gather our witts.  Like clockwork the four of us fell into battle, Cellence must have been shaken from her trip through the portal because her magic seemed to escape her.  As we were about to dispach the final bat, it dove into the lake.   The surface of the lake began to bubble up and a black dragon rose from its depths.  It wasted no time shrowding itself in darkness and attacking.  While most of us stood still struck with fear, the faithful Gnasc (who's scarred body is proof he has seen far worse than a dragon) tried to snap us out of it, only Marrek responded.  The fight with the dragon was tough, it moved around the lake, retreating to the depths at times.  Once during the fight I thought I was finnished but Marrek lept between me and the dragon, scoring a devistating blow to the beast and saving my life.  I did not have time to think about it in the moment, but Cellence must have felt bad during the fight, the neasuea of the portal was still effecting her ability to weild magic.  Marrek delt the killing blow to the dragon, and not a moment too soon, I fear had the fight lasted any longer we all would have perished. In a small cave in the back we found the stolen shipments of Ale from the Clifside Brewery along with a chest containing a gem and a magic dagger.  One of the casks was busted open, fromt he inside.  The remenants of a black dragon's egg was inside this cask, along with a scroll written in Draconic.  It read: "To the vigorous soldier and noble friend Armos Kamroth, I send my most sincere greetings in the name of Tiamat. May you continue in good health and good spirits, most reverend and divinely favored Lord and may my humble gift provide you some aid in your endeavors." We returned to the Cliffside Brewery with the remaining casks of Ale and more than a few questions for Orek Gernsan.  After a bit of questiong it was clear he did not know about the dragon, and he suggested we seek Old keller to help us gain an audience with Baron Stockmer.  We found Keller at Aunt Nonie's, and he agreed to set a meeting for the morning. We setteled in for the night, only to be awaken by the sounds of fighting outside and the glow of fire through our windows.  Arming ourselves we rushed outside to help where we could.  Two bugbears and a handfull of hobgoblins were in the town square, and set upon us as we exited the inn.   It was a gruling fight, the aches from the battle with the dragons were still fresh, just when we thought we had the square cleaned out more of the goblinkin poured into the square.  Benadrix and I were exausted but stood to face the Sub Commander as our friends dispatched the remaining archers.  Merrek acted quickly again this fight and saved Benadrix from sure death at the point of an arrow, this allowed Benadrix to help me finish the Sub Commander.  Even at the end of the battle the night was not won, much of the town was on fire, and the goblins had taken some of the townsfolk prisoner. We found a letter ordering the torching of the town, on the Sub Commander, and that the chared bodies of the dead were to be brought to Thunderspire.  Marrek claime the Commanders sword, clearly a magical weapon.   When the fires were out, we reited back to the inn where Old Keller was waiting for us.  He thanked us again for saving the town and presented me with his shield from his younger days, it is covered in Dwarven and Draconic runes and he explained that it will protect me as well as my allies.  Exausted we headed back to our rooms, the meeting with Baron Stockmer tomorrow seems like an eternity away. Your friend, 148 Marekk Lagonn stood at a crossroads. The Old Kings Road cut through the Nentir Valley. It was crisscrossed by smaller trade routes and mountain paths. It was at one of these intersections that Marekk stood now. His father's sword felt heavy at his waist as he studied the road in front of him. He had left the place of his birth nearly a year ago after making every effort to restore his family's name. Had he given up? Should he have tired harder? Was his father looking down on him now and shaking his head in shame as the last of the Lagonn line wandered the world, lost in more ways than one? Marekk sighed and looked to his trusted companion. The Gnoll stood a few yards back studying the dense forest on either side of the road. Gnasc smelled something in the woods that much he was sure of. The trees were no doubt full of animals but this scent was different, strange. He lifted his massive head and straightened his long ears, straining to hear something. Since Marekk had freed him from that slaving camp he had followed the human on his journey. He seemed to have no clear destination in mind but that didn't bother Gnasc. The man had risked his life to save him from a life of slavery, and Gnasc owed him something. He wasn't sure exactly what, but he was determined to follow Marekk until his debt was paid. A branch broke in the woods to the east and Gnasc's head snapped up in that direction. Marrek's hand shot to his sword handle as he also reacted to the noise. 148 stood in the trees watching the strangers. He'd heard them coming and had chosen to hide along side the road and wait for them to pass. But they hadn't passed. The human and his Gnoll had just stopped at the crossroads. The man seemed to be trying to decide which direction to go next. It was a simple situation and not an uncommon problem, unless you happen to be a magically animated mechanical construct. 148 had never had never known what it was like to choose a path. He was built to serve and fight for his master and that's exactly what he did. Even after being rescued and repaired by dwarves who told him he was now free he still didn't fully understand the concept. They had taken him to the Old King's road and told him to go off and choose his own life. He had simply followed the road with mechanical precision unsure what it meant to choose. Now he sat in the woods watching this human survey the roads ahead of him and he was fascinated. What was going in on in his head? His massive frame shifted in the wet ground and a twig snapped under his weight. When he looked back to the road the human was staring directly at 148, his hand on his sword and the Gnoll seemed to have vanished. Marekk was surprised to see a Warforged emerge from the tree line. The massive war machine walked slowly from the woods his hands raised in the universal symbol of peace. The irony was not wasted on him. He relaxed his sword arm but left his hand resting on the hilt. Gnasc appeared from the shadows behind him. No matter how many times he saw the Gnoll pull this trick it never ceased to impress him. He was just about to ask the machine what exactly he was doing hiding in the woods when he heard a deep laugh from just up the road. Benadrix walked the Old Kings Road completely content. He had been chosen! Thank Kord he had been chosen and his destiny had been made clear. A paladin might serve his entire life and never receive such a profound vision. Kord had showed him the village of Harken and let him know that his future started there. He'd meet a group of travelers on the Old Kings road and together they would go to Harken. as he crested a hill he saw a strange group ahead of him. A human, a Warforged and a Gnoll all arranged in what looked like a standoff. He laughed as he approached them, surely these were the companions Kord had shown him! Marekk watched as the Dragonborn approached their group. He walked right between him and the machine without breaking his swift stride. He guessed that the beast was smiling but the rows of razor sharp teeth made him uneasy. The Dragoborn continued on down road. Without even looking back he said in heavily accented common "What are you all waiting for, Harken is this way!" The warforged looked at the Human and the Gnoll and then walked off after the Dragonborn. Marekk and Gnasc shared a look. This was simply too strange, they had to find out what was going on. Marekk straightened up, adjusted his armor and walked off after the Dragonborn. He looked up at the sky. The horizon was crowded with heavy black clouds. A storm was coming. After a cold day in the rain we came across Harken Village. Looking to warm up and escape the rain we asked for directions to the local pub. We were directed to The Old Cliffside Brewery, and no sooner had we sat down than we were approached by an old dwarf named Keller. Old Keller told us about how the village was being terrorised by a band of goblins, and asked if we could help. He seemed truly concerned, and when it was clear he was speaking for the whole town when he offered us 25 gold each to help rid the town of these goblin raiders. Benadrix tried to squeeze some more gold out of him but Keller said the best he could do is the 25 gold and free food and lodging while we were in town. Marrek agreed first, and predictably Gnasc was quick to agree too. When I agreed that I would help too I was afraid Benadrix would part ways and our short friendship would be over but he too agreed to help the village, but only after he was given a room and a nights rest. Old Keller took us to the only inn in town, Aunt Nonnie's . Keller secured us four rooms, and Aunt Nonnie was clear that it was costing her 5 silver apiece but she was happy to do so if we could rid the town of the goblins. Not needing to sleep I thought about just asking for the silver but I didn't want to cause any problems within our fledgling group. Aunt Nonnie seemed empty except for the four of us so we headed back over to the Old Cliffside Brewery to see if we could gather any more information on these raids. When we entered the pub this time Gnasc noticed an elf in the corner who was spending a little more time looking at us than anyone else in the room. He was also equipped much differently than the locals, with a bow and two fine swords my guess is that he is a ranger. We approached him, thinking he may know more about these goblins than others. He was not very interested in talking and in fact tried to turn use away from his table, until Benadrix convinced him otherwise. If he knew anything he did not let on, talking to him was almost as productive as talking to a wall, even after Marrek bought him a drink. After a few fruitless minutes of trying to talk to him, Marrek went to talk to Old Keller and the bartender, Orek Gernsan . It turns out that the Cliffside Brewery has been hit hard by these raiders, about half of the shipments to neighboring towns have been hit. Gernsan asked us to bring back any of these lost shipments that we may find. After a restful night in the inn, Old Keller took us to the entrance of the catacombs that he believed the goblins were hiding out in. Gnasc snuck in first, I am still amazed at how stealthy he is for being even bigger than me, and checked the room. There were three goblins seated around a table. Eager to prove myself to my friends I rushed in, with them right behind me. We had a bit of a rough fight, especially after two more goblins appeared from the shadows. While it may not have been the prettiest fight we were able to defeat our foes and after searching the room we also found a pouch with 40 gold inside. After a short rest, we followed another hallway where we found some more goblins, one who seemed to have just finished up some kind of ritual. Gnasc was not able to sneak in on this group of goblins. The Hexer in the back of the room summoned some rats, who launched themselves with reckless abandon at us. Benadrix and I quickly tried to make our way to the Hexer thinking he would be the biggest threat in the room, but before we could reach him he summoned two large fire beatles , and Gnasc and Marrek were separated from us by them. We fought hard, and did much better than the previous battle. Though he was bloodied we were unable to stop the Hexer from escaping through a door to another room. Taking a moment to gather ourselves we searched the room, and I found a large gem in the bottom of the brazier. The door the Hexer went through opened up to a large room with a vicious looking statue overlooking a large pit in the floor. There was a large Dire Wolf behind an iron grate, with two goblins standing guard near it. One of them too close to a leaver that most certainly would set the Dire W
lf free. The Hexer was across the room, and there was another even more ornately dressed goblin across the pit from us along with a smaller wolf. There were also quite a few goblins in the room as well. Early on in the fight I was magically pulled into the pit by the Warcaster , and shortly after that Marrek was also dropped into the pit. I helped him escape, and when I managed to climb out my friends had cleared much of the room, and to my relief the Dire Wolf was still caged. I was able to finish off the Warcaster , but the Hexer , while still recovering from our last battle still put up a good fight. He was able to pull the lever to free the Dire Wolf just before he died. The Dire Wolf was in a frenzy by the time the gate opened, but it was so bloodthirsty that it did not put up much of a fight. I felt bad for having to kill the Dire Wolf, but it was so worked up having been caged by those goblins we did not have a choice. We discovered a locked door and while Marrek , Gnasc , and I struggled with it, Benadrix busied himself with pushing the statue into the pit. We were unable to open the door, but we did find a crued map of Harken on the Warcaster with the Brewery marked, along with the estate of Baron Stockmer . There was also a note about capturing villagers for slaves. There was a second door blocked by lots of rubble, clearly done by the goblins. While interested in the door, we were exhausted from the fights and thought it best to warn the town of what we found. We were unable to find any of Gernsan's shipments, but perhaps they are behind the locked door. I am also interested to find out what has the goblins so scared they would block off the door in the last room. I also need to learn more about Baron Stockmer . Also after spending the first years of my life in something like slavery I will not let any of these villagers be subjected to that, I only hope my new friends feel as strongly about this. Your Friend, 148
On April 11th, a show that may well end up being the next great television drama will debut on HBO. I have written about Treme in the past, but in case you have not paid attention, here is the dealio: Treme, named after the Faubourg Tremé neighborhood in the French Quarter, is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and looks at the situation through the eyes of the jazz musicians. The cast is damn impressive and features Simon vets Mellisa Leo ( Det. Sgt. Kay Howard in Homicide: Life on the Streets), The Wire's Clarke Peters (THE WIRE), Wendell Pierce (Also from THE WIRE) and Khandi Alexander (THE CORNER) as well as John Goodman, Steve Zahn and Kim Dickens. Here is the new trailer to get you ready. Trailer With season one barely over, word comes that there will be a change in the cast for season two. Marsha Thomason will be returning as FBI agent Diana Lancing, the character she played in the series pilot. Marsha has previously appeared on LOST and LAS VEGAS. As she comes, Natalie Morales will be leaving. Natalie played agent Lauren Cruz in throughout the season, but often in a minor capacity. Natalie will be staying within the NBC/Uni family as she joins the NBC comedy PARKS AND RECREATION. Season two begins this summer. Good news for fans of Victor Gischler : Director Sean Byrne is on board for the planned film of of the very cool GO-GO GIRLS OF THE APOCALYPSE. Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world. Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an America that no longer exists. The highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. What little civilization remains revolves around Joey Armageddon's Sassy A-Go-Go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with M16s. Accompanied by his cowboy sidekick Buffalo Bill, the gorgeous stripper Sheila, and the mountain man Ted, Mortimer journeys to the lost city of Atlanta -- and a showdown that might determine the fate of humanity. Byrnes'feature film debut, THE LOVED ONES, won the Midnight Madness Audience Award at the Toronto Film Festival and generated quite a buzz in the film world. Prior to THE LOVED ONES, he directed a number of shorts and has been compared to a young Sam Rami. That is a hell of a compliment. Check out this interview with Twitch.com . I have always enjoyed Victor's work, but GO-GO GIRLS rocked mightily and was one of my favorite books of 2008. It kicks ass and is a lot of fun. If you have not picked it up, do yourself a favor and get a copy right now! HBO has announced that season three of TRUE BLOOD will begin SUNDAY, JUNE 13 at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT). Mill Creek Entertainment Release date: March 9, 2010 MSRP: $14.98 Runtime: 20 episodes, 720 minutes, 4 discs Silk Stalkings is another Stephen J. Cannell-created series previously released on DVD by Anchor Bay, discontinued, and now re-released by Mill Creek. First aired in 1991 as part of CBS's Crimetime After Primetime lineup, the show focused on two partners in the West Palm Beach, Florida PD assigned to sexually-based crimes of passion. As its timeslot and title suggest, the show was more risqu&eacute; than much of network TV at the time, but seems tame compared to today's fare. While there was a lot of flash, co-stars Mitzi Kapture and Rob Estes had more substance in their performances than you might expect. Kapture's Rita Lee Lance was beautiful, but also driven by a brain aneurysm that plagued her with headaches and threatened to burst anytime. Estes's Chris Lorenzo was more casual on the surface, but a dependable partner and friend to Rita. Both actors could pull off the show's mix of saucy and serious dialogue. When Crimetime After Primetime was cancelled in 1993, Silk Stalkings moved to USA Network, where it ran until 1999 with new partners rotating in a la Law &amp; Order—a testament to the strength of its premise. I have a soft spot for first seasons and enjoyed revisiting the show as first conceived. The first season also features Ben Vereen as Chris and Rita's captain and Danny Gans as medical examiner Roger. This set has no extras and is packaged in inconvenient, flimsy paper-and-cellophane sleeves, but as with all Mill Creek sets, the $14.98 price is the real draw. --Gerald So With just a month to go before shooting, the cast for MILDRED PIERCE is starting to fill out. With more names coming out this last week, I thought this would be a good time to take a look at who is who so far: Kate Winslet: The title character. Mildred Pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. She used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower middle class. But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. (Joan Crawford in the original). Do I really need to talk about Kate? Evan Rachel Wood: Veda, the aforementioned monstrous daughter. Despite Mildred's attempts to provide a better life for her, Vera wants more and will do almost anything to get what she feels she deserves. (Ann Blyth). Wood played Rourke's daughter in THE WRESTLER and was quite good in THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Guy Pearce: Monte Beragon, the wealthy playboy that eventually becomes Mildred's second husband. Almost immediately, we learn that things don't end too well for him. (Zachary Scott). Pearce is best known for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and MEMENTO and recently appeared in THE HURT LOCKER. Brian F. O'Byrne: Bert Pierce, Mildred's first husbamd, after he loses his job, Mildred leaves in hopes of finding a better life (Bruce Bennett). O'Bryne can currently be seen as Aaron Stark on FlashForward and was Colin on BROTHERHOOD. James LeGros: Wally Fay, Bert's former business partner (Jack Carson). LeGros was recently seen as Dr. Dan Harris in MERCY and also had regular roles in ALLY MCBEAL and SLEEPER CELL. He also played Raylan Givens in Elmore Leonard's PRONTO on Showtime. Melissa Leo is Ida Corwin, Mildred's friend (Eve Arden). Leo was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in FROZEN RIVER and will be in the upcoming David Simon series TREME on HBO. Morgan Turner: Veda, younger but still a wretched creature. Todd Haynes co-wrote the screenplay and will be directing. He wrote and directed 2002's acclaimed FAR FROM HEAVEN (which got him an Oscar nomination). I want to open this up with the disclosure that I am not a fan of the Stargate franchise. I'm not saying I don't like, I'm saying I don't know it or watch it. I saw the original movie and really enjoyed it. I've seen a few episodes of the two show, Stargate and Stargate Atlantis and it didn't really move me one way or the other. Another Sci Fi show to watch to kill time in a pleasant enough way. Ol' Jeremy asked if I was interested in this and the name Robert Carlyle got my attention. I'll watch anything he does, and so far I've enjoyed all his work. So, quick Stargate rundown. Mankind discover gateways to other worlds put here by a group they call the Ancients. Being mankind we start to explore going to other worlds. Now you know all you need to to watch this. A group called Icarus is on a planet with a very powerful gate. To access an as yet unreachable destination they need help cracking a code. They recruit a genius who lives with Mom and plays video games all day. They crack the code just as the location of the group is under attack. Most people shoot to a ship and back to earth, however a smaller group of civilians and military go through the gateway and land a ship called the Destiny. New mission, find a way home. They can communicate with Earth through tech originating with the Ancients that lets them swap bodies, however they are mostly on their own. They need to find food and water and keep the ship running. Carlyle plays a scientist(Dr, Nicholas Rush) who is obsessed with the ship and really cares about nothing else. Elli Wallace is the young genius who is just fascinated by it all, but also the most interesting as he is not influenced by either faction wanting to control the tech. Everett Yong is in charge, but it's shaky at best. Minng Na plays a human resources person who is representing an oversight group with their own agendas. other layers include various military and civilan folks who work together to try and get home. Lou Diamond Phillips is a Colnol Telford who was supposed to be in charge of a team ready for this mission instead of the rag tag team actually on the ship. He adds a wonderful dynamic to the cast. Even Richard Dean Anderson from the original series has a role here and it really ties it together nicely. I love the cast with one exception. Ming Na is a crappy actress. I couldn't stand her on ER and I don't like her here. She over does movements and facial expressions and always looks pissed off. All the other people on the show seem natural in their roles, she seems to over think it and it feels false. I hope they kill her off in a nasty fashion. They even added a lesbian element to her character which really does nothing other than try to be hip. Kill her off. Other than that one character I love this show. It has elements of various other sci fi things I've seen and enjoyed but it is also very character driven and well plotted. Whether you are a fan of Stargate or not I think this is a shoe worth checking out. Season 1.0 was a lot of fun and the DVD set was over faster than I would have liked. I'll be watching all the rest as soon as they come out. So end result: I love everything about the show except for one actress. I recommend this. Buy Stargate SG-U: 1.0 Season 1.5 comes back on the air April 2nd. When I heard the news that the cast was changing I was mad. I love Vincent D'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe on the show and after 8 seasons i want more. I questioned what the Hell they were thinking. I've seen the first two episodes of Season 9 and I have to say the send off was perfect. LOYALTY part one and two were really something special and on the strength of these two episodes I think the show will still be a favorite. Something weird is going on with their Captain (Eric Bogosian) and Goren and Eames are not going to let it it sit. Before long things get crazy with the international implications, FBI and the upper brass in NYPD all tangling things up. I don't want to give anything away plot wise, but the title of the shows, LOYALTY is right on. Goldblum is great, I like his new partner played by Saffron Burrows (Boston Legal) a lot as the new Detective from Chicago. Don't worry, it looks ike Law and Order Criminal Intent will still be a great show, and I for one, can't wait to keep watching. Look for it on TUESDAY March 30th on USA Network
As you can see, the enclosed blog post has been around far awhile. It has been typed and ready to go for more than a month, and was waiting for the rest of the thought to finish it off. I have done little so far this year but run and hide. I am having a hard time emotionally, but am not wasting time just whining about it. True, running from a problem does not lead to solving anything, but on the other hand neither does whining. My basic time fillers have been reading, 15 books since January l; running up the hill to the chapel, usually two to three times a day, four or five days a week; and last but not least, countless hours mopping, waxing and buffing floors. I have not heard from my brother, and at this point it seems fairly clear that he will not be writing to me at all. I have also lost all hope that any of my worldly possessions, tools, clothes, etc. will be available to me when I get out. It would appear to me that all I have to look forward to upon my release is what I take with me from here. As far as human contact goes at this point it is down to Abby and you. I guess this is as low as I can get so I better start the rebuilding phase soon! I have plenty to say, I need to let it all out and see what develops. I am wondering if the blog is really the place to write the true inside prison story. Oh yes, plenty of mano on mano sex, gambling away all my money, beating up on the weaker ones here, etc. Kidding. Maybe we could go the taxpayer report route. How about how all the overweight staff members continue to belly up to the inmate food bar and stuff themselves at taxpayer expense? Okay just a little bitterness. I just caught a line in the NY Post about Amy Fisher raising money for Haiti by going nude at some Long Island strip club or something. Apparently this mother of three and product of NY State Department of Corrections is embarking on a cross county strip club trip to promote her personal porn web site. I did read her memoir of her time in the system that includes at least two or three rapes from prison guards. One strange thing in my own life is for some reason I continue to receive the NY Times. I am not sure if perhaps my brother has just not figured out yet that it is going on Mom's charge card or what. I have not heard from my brother since his one letter, and I think I sent you a copy of my response. I did send a Christmas card to mom, but have received nothing from them. Ironically the NY Times is still coming and I can tell from the mailing labels when the next payment is due. It is every four weeks. I wonder if Bill has figured out that it is being billed to mom’s credit card or not. I could write and say okay instead of the paper send me the cash, but to be honest while I know it is expensive, it provides a vital link to a world outside that gives me a little hope for the future. Not to mention the little nuggets I get to share with others. For example did you catch the story around Thanksgiving about the drama camp that was performing in the Macy's Parade? I know you said you discontinued you daily newspaper delivery, but do you catch it online? The title of the article is around here somewhere on a single piece of paper for me to tell you and I do not know where the note is now. I thought it might be something to look into for your creative non hockey playing son. Hey I found the note. The article was in the 11/20/09 edition. "Happy Campers Command Stage in Macy's Parade." The name of the camp is Stagedoor Manor Theatre Camp. Not sure if it would be something of interest, but appearing in the Macy's parade is not too shabby a place to be. Time is fleeting, and I must end this typing session. I could try to continue by hand but it would quickly become unreadable. Hopefully I will get some more sleep, and continue this letter to you. Then I could easily take the issues in this letter and make plenty of blog material. The one true hope I have still of being of some use to at the least reinforce my sense of self and my humanity, and maybe still, a small but powerful, community of people that can take some part in my future existence. You are, as always, a powerful anchor in my life. I hope you are not being tossed around too badly out there in the real world. I know you too have pressures and demands on your time, and look forward to any part of that time you can share with me. I have even mentioned the missing night's sleep. I have become the sole keeper of the floors for the day area and much of the dorm. Yeah we allegedly have porters, but this is one dorm where porters get away with not doing their jobs. More on this to follow. But for the last four or five months I have been responsible for mopping up the day area after 11:30 PM. Then starting in November that included stripping the floors, and now I have put over eight coats of wax on them. This Sunday evening I decided to not only mop the floors but do some buffing and rewaxing too. Just mopping the floor usually involves at least two or three changes of the water in the buckets. One for the soap, one to rinse. So after doing a super special mop job I start using the high speed buffing machines to both remove some of the scratches and put a shine back on the floor. I am doing this work all by myself, which is actually a good thing, while all the other inmates sleep. I finish up around 6:30 AM Monday morning, just in time to make me a bowl of oatmeal and start laying the first three coats of wax in the dorm area. This takes me till about 12:00 noon, and then I have lunch which was another gift of venison, and up to the chapel I go both at 3:00 and again at 7:00 PM for two hours each time to work on the clerk stuff and computer program I am trying to do in Excel, which is a trip since there are no help files installed. But what I can do is record macros, which are shown in Visual Basic, and try to edit them into workable code. I arrived back at the dorm around 9:00 PM and napped for about 90 minutes, and was back up at 11 PM to mop the floors. I got to bed around 1:00 AM this morning, but was up at 7:00 AM to put more wax on the floors. Today we ended having our inmates move out of the dorm, and as a result a couple guys got to move into single cubes from the double cubes, and then we had a few new guys come in. So this high tech operation prohibited me from waxing today. I need to get about eight coats of wax to have the floor really shine. So instead of trying to catch up on my sleep, I ended up heading up the hill to the Chapel at 9:00, 12:30, and 3:00. I finally arrived back at the dorm at 5:00, and around 6:30 was chowing down with a half pound of pasta with octopus tomato sauce. By the way since I have eliminated most of the comfort/munchie type foods from my diet I am down to 206 since September when I was pushing 225! I tried to disappear for a bit and take a nap but that did not work. So I have pulled out the typewriter and penned this opus to you. As I think I have mentioned to you, Ray has sort of become an adoptive son to me. Heck my oldest son is older than he is. Anyhow, for the last couple of months, we have prepared and eaten at least one meal a day together. Ray is extremely conflicted about receiving financial support from his family, but they are certainly able to provide it. I need to tell you some of the stories Ray has told me, to let you get a clearer picture of his life. One recent night, he sought me out to talk after getting an emotionally conflicted call from his adoptive mom. His Bio mom is apparently a real jerk. One note is of course I have no outside collaboration which adds a layer of mystery to this whole thing. So Ray tells me it is not fair, I have it all together as to how to handle life, and his life is in total chaos. Ray's payroll from the mess hall has varied from $14 to $28 every two weeks, so once we decide on the meals for the next two weeks, he would spend most of his money, and I would pick up the rest. In addition I would still get my three boxes of oatmeal, ten packets in each. I use two at a time, and two jars of peanut butter plus two loaves of wheat bread for my lunch. The meals would be pasta or bean dishes. The point is that now with my funds all but gone, he still has not gotten around to getting in any funds, and while there are a few specific amounts he owes me, it was always assumed that at some point in the near future, he would become the larger contributor. Or not. That is what I deal with: is he for real in seeking out my wisdom and support, or is he a fine tuned con man who has managed to eat well for the last few months at my expanse? It is hard to tell. Yes, I could choose to not share my resources with others, but that is not who I am. I laugh when I tell others that did not realize when I moved into my cube that it was also the condiment bar for the dorm. One inmate for instance, who is leaving in six weeks, gets monthly packages from home, full $55 buys from commissary, yet he ask me for ketchup to dress up his food bowl. Another inmate that works in the kitchen and has access to all sorts of condiments also asks me for ketchup etc. to dress up the burgers and things he takes back from the mess hall. Another inmate just tonight said he needs my help. he apparently did something dumb at work in the mess hall and ended up getting a ticket. One other golden tidbit Ray dropped at dinner tonight was that Darnell and another inmate that lives in our dorm were caught fucking around in a back area of the mess hall. The officer that caught them is the one that Ray said did not want me working there. As a result the one inmate lost his job, but it looks like no penalty against Darnell. For the record, Darnell is 240 pounds of solid muscle. When I asked Ray if he meant fucking around in the sexual sense as opposed to a more physical horseplay, but also prohibited behavior, he said the sexual. So go figure that one out. In other words, the fucking around was at least consensual, but at worst, Darnell was the aggressor. Mind you, the truth is such a hard thing to find out around here. I do not know who or what is the truth. Although Mark, heretofore the unmentioned inmate, did lose his job in the mess hall, the really strange part is that Mark is about 80 days from the door. Go figure. So I am not sure if I have mentioned Darnell Biggins to you before. He is the inmate clerk in the mess hall, and in the past has made my life miserable, and made it tough for me to find time to work on the computer once they had taken my personal machine from me. Today I see him up at the chapel and I happen to mention the $2.00 and change missing from my pay. He says that should not be. I further mention that it appears they have switched my job number, which governs the normal hours I get paid, and the rate. He claims he did not know that it was switched. It has been going on for over six weeks, and I know he personally fills out the preprinted time sheets with all the hours for each of the 100 plus inmates listed. Since I used to be in a group of six or so inmates listed on their own page, and am now on the regular list with about 65 other inmates, it would be tough to miss. He is either stupid, or lying to me. I happened to mention to Ray (Carlton) that I talked to Biggins, and that Biggins said the reason I was still not working was that two staff people did not want me around. One is an officer, the other, one of the civilian cooks. Ray mentions no, it is another one of the officers down there that does not want me there. Ironically, all of the people mentioned have been there for a while and while I might not be their best friend, I was working with them in the past. The point is that I do not know how much of what Darnell -- oops, so used to staff people calling inmates by their last name -- is saying is possibly the truth, nor what Ray says is the whole story either. It still amazes me not only that any staff person is willing to look the great gift of my services in the mouth, and how little power John Black, the food service manager has over what goes on in the area he is responsible for. Are you able to follow any of this, or do you even care? I am not sure how much of this I really want you to write back about, but if you want better (more) detail just ask. I would rather you not mention specific questions just in case your letter does get read on the way in. My life of late has been little more than a downward spiral. As I was taught way back when, "Cheer up I says things could be worse." Sure enough I cheered up and they got worse! You last letter started off with a complaint of lack of letters on my side. I sent two letters in a few days time, and then silence. Okay I know from your Christmas card, you were fighting some bronchitis (why did you wait to go to doctor!) and it was the busy Christmas season so I thought I might hear from you by now. Alas, the old wait for tomorrow trick has now seen twelve days pass. So I am writing now. I am wondering if I put too many requests in my last letters and you are pissed off? I thought I had told you if you ever feel the requests are too much, skip them. There was the question posed by the person about having me write more about the inside perspective of prison. I think I have also sent you a copy of the letter I finally sent back to my brother. So I thought there should have been something there to write back to me about. If not, then hopefully something in this missal will tickle your fancy. I hope so; certainly my life has not had many tickles in it. About the only ray of sunshine in my life has been Abby, and she surprised me with a bunch of books that arrived here at the end of last month! Boy do I remember the frequent, numerous and much awaited book drops you used to make. I no sooner get back from the package room and three or four inmates are already at my bunk wanting to see what titles I got in. One reason I am writing now, 8.15 PM on Tuesday, is I received my bi-weekly commissary sheet today upon my return from the chapel. For the first time in many years I only have $55.20 in my account. My pay for my no-show job has been adjusted downward to $13.30 per week. My last three commissary buys were for $76.57, $73.85 and $64.37. So with only $13.30 coming in, things are looking really depressing. I am looking at my handwritten letter. Either there is another letter or perhaps I misdated that one. No, in all likelihood my funk has led to delusional thinking that I am writing more often to you than I am. Boy that is a surprise. I just received a letter from Abby, and she ended up spending a few days in two different hospitals to be diagnosed as having severe stomach problems apparently related to the loss of proper nerve functioning related to lifelong battle with diabetes. The medicine they are giving her is only a stopgap measure, as you are not supposed to take it for more than three months. She went to a local hospital over the weekend only to end up being transferred to a major medical center within the area. I do not know if you care but she lives in a town apparently in the middle of nowhere, and the nearest hospital can only handle more mundane ills so she was transferred by ambulance to the larger facility. I still have not heard from my brother, or even my brother acting as the letter writer for my mother. It appears at this point that I am never again going to be able to have a two way communication with Mom. From the "cheer up things could be worse" department, well sure enough I cheered up and they got worse. I received my monthly statement today and it turns out for some unknown reason my weekly $15.20 pay from my mess hall job had now been reduced to $13.30 a week. On the one hand I should be grateful I have been kept on the payroll without doing any work, but on the other hand, if I am supposed to be paid x amount, then pay me that. I have to get my ass in gear and answer with more detail the issues I raised on my earlier letter. Ray and I had a pound or so of venison sausage today in a tomato sauce with a pound of pasta, 1/2 each. There was some extra sauce which is about to have two cans of beans added to it and with a sleeve of saltines become a late supper. It is my second known encounter with deer meat and I have to admit it is pretty good. Of course since i
 has been years since I have had anything that resembles red meat, this is certainly a treat. Our regular officer has been off the past two days, (Wednesday-Thursday) and will be back tomorrow so I will probably be doing a whole bunch of floor scrubbing and waxing. Also the 11 PM to 7 AM regular guy is back in a few hours after his two days off so I will probably be up till 3 or 4 am doing stuff in the day area too. I did get a letter off tonight to Jerry in California, so I will see if that pans out to another person to reach out to. Oh wait a MINUTE there was another letter which included my response to my brother! My typing without proofing leaves something to be desired I know. But I figured a few typos are better than no letter at all. I just do not have the patience at this point to proof and retype a letter I am struggling a bit. It seems I am a positive supportive presence in Ray’s life and Abby makes a comment about how I write to her more than her son John and she wants me to write more, that once in a while I need a place to go to recharge my batteries. That place/person just does not exist right now. On the one hand I want to yell at the powers to be that hey you let me do all that great programming for you for six plus months, you are still using it, I got little benefit for the value you received, and yet you now treat me like a black sheep of the family. Please let me do what I am good at. Let me build up my own self esteem since everything else around here is based on the premise that we can tear it all apart. So I hope you had a good holiday, I guess you had a few off, and now it is time to think about back to work. So now that you have gotten two letters this week, I am going to see if I can get some more out to you on Sunday evening.
No real analysis here, but I'd like to draw your attention to this recent article by Kenneth Chang in the New York Times about recent work that might shed light on the very early earth. I am highlighting the article both because it deals with geochronology (U-Pb zircon geochronology to be exact), and because it is a rare article dealing explicitly with geology; not modern climate change or some geoscience themed hazard, but straight up geology. The article also has some good quotes from some of the grand high mucky mucks of geology including Mark Harrison, John Valley, and Norm Sleep. I've seen a talk version of some of this data before, and when I get into my office tomorrow I'll check out the Nature paper as well and try to comment, although in all honesty I seriously doubt I'd come up with much more insightful than Professors Harrison, Valley, Sleep, and Mojzsis.In consideration of self promotion, if you'd like some background on geochronology to help with the NY Times article, check out this earlier post of mine, or any of the background geology posts I have listed on my sidebar.
Nonprofit organizations—and their staff/boards—which are part of the institutional Catholic Church should clearly support the teachings of the Church, just as employees/board members of any nonprofit have to be supportive of the mission of the nonprofit they serve. This story from the Washington Post reports on the issue. An excerpt. “Shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, Catholic Charities of Washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “That language was added March 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman Erik Salmi. He said the move did not reflect a policy change because employees have been told during training that the organization is Catholic in more than name. “Catholic Charities, one of the region's largest nonprofit organizations, has been trying to develop a way to continue its multimillion-dollar social service partnerships with the District while not recognizing the city's same-sex marriage law, which the D.C. Council approved in December. Employees were told this month that the agency was changing its health-care coverage to avoid offering benefits to its workers' same-sex partners. “Salmi said the addition of the clause to the hiring letter was not a result of the new law but rather reflected a longer-term concern that employees adhere to the organization's Catholic philosophy. “Salmi said the new language "is more of an expectation than a condition. It's letting people know this is the culture." Asked if that meant employees could speak or act against the church without being fired, Salmi said: "We can't speculate on the hypothetical. It's handled on a case-by-case basis." “A former vice president of the organization's human resources department, however, said the new language appeared to be a change. "Putting it in a letter and requiring a signature, that's a condition of employment. There's no way to dance around that," said Wayne Swann, who served 3 1/2 years on Catholic Charities' board of directors and an additional four years as its vice president. “Shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, Catholic Charities of Washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “That language was added March 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman Erik Salmi.

That being said, this example reported by the Washington Post , might not be appropriate, but until all of the circumstances are reported it can’t be determined. An excerpt. “Several Republican senators are questioning expenses at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a national nonprofit organization that receives millions of dollars in federal funding. “Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.) and John Cornyn (Tex.) asked in a letter to the group, released Friday, whether money is being spent on executive pay, travel and lobbying rather than on programs for needy children. “The umbrella organization, which receives nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the federal government, stands to gain hundreds of millions of dollars more from a bill pending in the Senate. The organization posted a loss of more than $13 million, according to its 2008 tax return, the most recent one available. "We find it hard to reconcile this loss given the amount spent on executive salaries, perks and lobbying expenses," the letter said. "We are especially concerned because it is our understanding that some independent clubs have closed or are on the cusp of closing because of a lack of funding." “Roxanne Spillett, president and chief executive of the tax-exempt organization, based in Atlanta, earned nearly $1 million in compensation in 2008. That includes a base salary of nearly $361,000, a $150,000 incentive and nearly $478,000 in benefits, expenses and contributions to a deferred retirement plan, a spokesman for the organization said in a written statement Friday. “Leaders of large nonprofits should earn competitive salaries, said Ken Berger, president and chief executive of Charity Navigator, a watchdog group. “The average compensation for executives at groups with more than $100 million dollars in annual revenue is $460,000, including deferred compensation, according to Charity Navigator.” A marvelous book I’ve been reading, Giving Well, Doing Good: Readings for Thoughtful Philanthropists , has many excellent thoughts to ponder, and one comes in the discussion of the different levels within the reasons for giving; and the third level relates to the best reason. An excerpt. “The third level—which might be described as the most mature form of giving—is a way of participating in the life of others, or an expression of gratitude. Here the key element is the other, the recipient; not the self, the giver. The giver wishes to be, and becomes a genuine participant who shares in an achievement by facilitating it. This giving also has the reward of a beneficent return, although the benefits are primarily for others than oneself.” (p. 129) This is a wonderful story, from the Stanford Social Innovation Review , about one person's vision-- it all so often starts with just one person --and her nonprofit's work to help immigrants to America become productive. An excerpt. “In 2000, while working for a national refugee resettlement organization in New York City, Jane Leu decided that the federally funded system of matching immigrants to careers was a failure. “We didn’t have an incentive to focus on [the] quality” of the placements, she remembers of her six years of putting highly educated, English-speaking foreigners in low-skill jobs. “It was just about quantity.” “So with no funding, a borrowed laptop computer, and her kitchen table as a makeshift office, Leu started the nonprofit Upwardly Global, whose goal is to help highly skilled immigrants reclaim their careers in the United States. “The beginning was rocky. With no funds and no employees, Leu was limited to one-on-one sessions with job seekers, reaching out to foundations for grants, and making employers aware of a hidden talent pool: 1.3 million bilingual workers with degrees and professional experience in every possible white-collar profession. “Successes trickled in. By 2002, the organization received its first grant and hired its first paid employee. In 2003, Leu’s work was recognized by the Draper Richards Foundation when she became its first fellow, earning a $300,000 grant. “Today, Upwardly Global employs 29 people to serve some 600 job seekers a year. With offices in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, the organization also relies on its wide network of volunteers. Since 2006, it has helped place 400 people with 300 employers such as Google, Genentech, Wells Fargo, the Gap, Safeway, and the Fresh Air Fund. Although Upwardly Global remains a small nonprofit with an annual operating budget of less than $2 million, it is widely credited for highlighting decades of “brain waste,” says Jeanne Batalova, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. It is also the first organization that reintegrates professional immigrants into the American workforce.” Most people are not aware of the large role that art—and the nonprofit cultural organizations that support them—play in the local economy, as they have in Midtown and North Sacramento. A recent study in Boston, reported by the Boston Globe , reveals just how productive that role can be. An excerpt. “Each year, 30,000 people visit the Danforth Museum of Art. Hundreds of youths participate in its free school programs, thousands of all ages enroll in art classes, and still more view exhibitions. “With this kind of score card, the Danforth finds it easy to convince the community of its value as a cultural asset. “But an economic engine? “A newly released study suggests that the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural institutions generate nearly double their budgets in local spending annually, creating scores of jobs along the way. “For people who believe in the arts, they get it when we tell them art is good because we know it’s good,’’ said Danforth’s executive director, Katherine French. “But that’s preaching to the converted. When we go to funders or business leaders or town officials, we need to be able to point to an argument that isn’t a matter of opinion.’’ “So, the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural organizations — Amazing Things Arts Center, Framingham History Center, Framingham Public Library, Garden in the Woods, and Performing Arts Center of MetroWest — united for an economic impact study paid for by the Sudbury Foundation. It was no academic exercise. “All six organizations are in the midst of, or are gearing up for, fund-raising campaigns to improve their facilities and ultimately make Framingham a tourist destination. They say proof of the jobs and business they create cinches their argument for financial support — especially during tough economic times.” The nonprofit world has long played an essential part in the nation’s politics. One of its earliest chroniclers, Count Alexis De Tocqueville, who came to America in the early 1800’s and met with many of the founders, wrote one of the most perceptive books ever written about America. Here is but a small part of what he said about voluntary associations—nonprofits. “Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States. “I have since traveled through England, from which the Americans took some of their laws and many of their usages, and it appeared to me that there they were very far from making as constant and as skilled a use of association. “It often happens that the English execute very great things in isolation, whereas there is scarcely an undertaking so small that Americans do not unite for it. It is evident that the former consider association as a powerful means of action; but the latter seem to see in it the sole means they have of acting. “Thus the most democratic country on earth is found to be, above all, the one where men in our day have most perfected the art of pursuing the object of their common desires in common and have applied this new science to the most objects. Does this result from an accident or could it be that there in fact exists a necessary relation between associations and equality?” (Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America , 2000 translation by H. C. Mansfield and D. Winthrop. pp. 489-490) Today, the work nonprofits do in the political world continues, as this report from OMB Watch notes. An excerpt. “Redistricting reform efforts have emerged as a key issue that could significantly impact our democracy in 2010 and beyond. While it does not appear that there will be nationwide redistricting reform, efforts are moving forward in several states. Nonprofits have taken a lead role in advocating for a process that is independent, nonpartisan, and fair while also ensuring that their constituencies' interests are represented. “Americans for Redistricting Reform (ARR) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that bills itself as "committed to raising public awareness of redistricting abuses and promoting solutions that benefit voters and strengthen our democracy." Its website allows visitors to learn about redistricting reform efforts in jurisdictions across the country. The site also contains fact sheets, court cases, research studies, and state and federal legislation on redistricting reform efforts. “ARR was launched by the Campaign Legal Center and includes major nonprofit organizations as advisory committee members, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, the Committee for Economic Development, Common Cause, Fair Vote, the League of Women Voters, the Reform Institute, the Republican Main Street Partnership, and U.S. PIRG.” It has many names, evaluation-outcomes-mission fulfillment, but whatever label is used, the point is that programs that ask for the public’s money—whether directly from the public in donations or indirectly from the public through government grants—to do something worthwhile, should be held accountable to have actually accomplished what it is they claim to have done. VPP News has an excellent piece on this. An excerpt. “In my last column, “‘Social Outcomes’: Missing the Forest for the Trees?,” I wrote about my deep, nagging fear that many efforts to assess outcomes are woefully off track. I pointed to several wonderful beams of shining light in the field, from Youth Villages to the Cleveland Clinic. But my dominant message was that many efforts in our sector are causing more harm than good. That column hit a nerve, triggering a volume and intensity of responses far greater than I had expected. “After struggling though literally 20 drafts, I wasn’t sure whether the piece was even coherent. Yet, it seemingly made some sense to a good number of thought leaders and practitioners I greatly respect—along with many others I don’t know who apparently care deeply about this issue as well. “Of course, not everyone agreed with my analysis. In fact, I got hard pushback on some points, and a few commentators wondered why it had taken me so long to own up to my own limitations in my approach over the years to the topic of outcomes. “The majority, however, agreed with the thesis that we’ve lost sight of the ends we’re trying to advance. In the wise words of David Hunter, Managing Partner of Hunter Consulting and former Director of Assessment for the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation: “It seems to me that the mess you describe indeed is enormous and very destructive—because few people involved in this work have thought deeply about m
naging towards outcomes and [they] have put the cart before the horse—focusing…on HOW to measure rather than on WHY measure…and WHAT to measure.” “Sins of Commission, Sins of Omission The feedback confirmed for me that nonprofit executives, staff, and boards; donors; and assessment experts are deeply frustrated with our sector’s work around outcomes. • I heard a lot of anger at funders who don’t walk (or fund) their talk. • I heard exasperation with nonprofits that are unwilling to embrace even basic methods of determining whether they’re doing what they say they do. • I heard disappointment that outcomes assessment has become an exercise focused on cold numbers—the equivalent of Robert McNamara’s simplistic and terribly misleading Vietnam body counts—rather than an effort to help nonprofit leaders achieve lasting impact for those they serve. “We must be intentional about surfacing these roiling frustrations that are rarely getting voiced. If we don’t, we’re going to continue to perpetrate sins of commission and omission that prevent us from making even the slightest dent in the failing status quo that defines education, healthcare, and social services in America.” One of the truly great examples of nonprofit work in education is the story of Catholic schools in America and as they enter a trying period in their illuminating history, having help charting the waters is appreciated. The Philanthropy Roundtable—itself a remarkable story of American philanthropy—has produced a marvelous resource, the 146 page publication Saving America’s Urban Catholic Schools: A Guide for Donors , which they have made available as a free pdf download.
It was a great experience and I have to thank Andreas Mitisek and the Long Beach Opera for allowing me to photograph behind the scenes of one of their recent rehearsals. Now, that being said, the person I owe the biggest thanks to is my favorite flautist, Teri Christian (aka FlutePrayer, who writes the blog, FlutePrayer ). I met Teri and her husband, Bob, through blogging and I've gotten to enjoy a couple of the performances (Opera and Municipal Band) they've been involved with down in Long Beach (Yay, Long Beach). I've been trying to work it out to to shoot one of the Long Beach Opera performances for quite a while. Teri has been the one working on getting me the okay to come in and snap away. I really hope I wasn't too much of a distraction. That was my biggest concern while shooting (well, that and also that I might suck at being a still photographer). No worries. Things seemed to work out fine. The orchestra and the all the performers had their game faces on and I did my best to ninja my way through the rehearsal. (Whoooo-WHA-KAI! Click, Click, Click! KI-YAAA!) God bless the Christians. (Heh-heh, doesn't that sound kind of redundant?) Our story was all about the coming boom in 3D entertainment technology.&nbsp; I was working with Dave Malkoff (who should really consider spelling his name M-a-l-k-o-v because that would be totally retro mad scientist sci-fi). &nbsp; We started in Burbank, shot an interview and b-roll for the piece, then drove over to the Burbank entertainment center to look for a good liveshot spot. We couldn't find a spot. Well, actually we found plenty of spots.&nbsp; Just none that would give us anything visually related to the story we were working.&nbsp; So, since we weren't going to be on TV until the later shows, we figured we should have plenty of time to dash over to LA Live. A good plan in theory. After battling crazy Friday evening traffic, we finally made it to a good spot for a liveshot.&nbsp; We set up just to the North side of the Regal Theaters. Right next to the psychic's office.&nbsp; Office?&nbsp; Hmm, what would you call it? Anyway, we managed to cut a piece that touted the coming wave of home 3D entertainment.&nbsp; No liveshot after all.&nbsp; We needed to be back to the station before the end of my shift and I needed to do that without hitting the station with a meal penalty. So, it wasn't the most action packed exciting night at work for me.&nbsp; Still, there's this one thing that I wanted to mention.&nbsp; I wanted to say just how cool it is to see parts of LA that most people don't even know about. Take Mr. Sippee for example. You might never have the opportunity (or logical reason) to try fried chicken sold at a gas station.&nbsp; Heck, right minds would tend to avoid something like that. Not me.&nbsp; But, then again, I did qualify that (yeah, right minds). Quick history: I first found Mr. Sippee during the 1984 Olympics (held in Los Angeles, if you remember).&nbsp; I was just out of school and working for ABC Sports.&nbsp; I don't remember why I stopped here, but ever since then, every few years, I manage to grab some chicken and their broasted potatoes. It's not exactly good, but it does take me back to a simpler time in my younger days. I can remember when I used eat junk like that and enjoy it.&nbsp; I'm glad I've grown up a little since then.&nbsp; I'm older and smarter and. . . (sigh) Okay, let me have one leg and thigh combo with potatoes, to go. Blogged with the Flock Browser It's not an excuse for not posting (Come on, Blogging is never having to say, I'm sorry!), but truthfully, it's been a difficult couple of weeks for me. You know, sometimes the postings are slow because I don't have much to say.&nbsp; Sometimes they're slow because nothing much interesting is happening. Sometimes they're slow because I'm dealing with things that don't leave me a lot of space to compose my thoughts in any form fit to share. That being said, today I'm trying to catch up on some the assignments I've had the last couple of weeks. Last Monday night, I found myself in a SAT truck covering a candlelight&nbsp; vigil for Amber Dubois. There were thousands of people crowded into the courtyard of Escondido High School.&nbsp; The vigil had started about 6:30pm.&nbsp; I was about twenty minutes too late to catch the beginning by the time I arrived. It's a long drive from North Hollywood during the afternoon rush hour, but I had a pretty good idea of the route.&nbsp; I'd passed through Escondido a week prior when I'd been assigned to cover the search for Chelsea King. Lots of time travelling there and back to think about things. Anyway, it was another couple of hours before things slowed enough for me to pull my DSLR out to snap a few still shots. By then vigil was over and most of the people had gone.&nbsp; So, right then it wasn't exactly me alone with my thoughts, but it was far fewer than had been there just an hour or so earlier. There was a sadness that hung over the area. I believe we are the sum total of the things we experience.&nbsp; Doing what I do as a news photographer I get to witness more grief than most people. Sometimes it's easier than others to keep that sadness from becoming my own.&nbsp; It's a struggle.&nbsp; Sometimes I win. Sometimes I don't. Blogged with the Flock Browser I wish this wasn't a part of my day. I'm running SNG for the Orange County bureau at the Amber Dubois memorial. Monsters do exist in our world. Stories like this happen and I know it's true. Posted via email from beFrank's posterous I'm not working the Oscars this weekend, so maybe I'll take some time to actually go to the movies.&nbsp; Either I haven't been motivated to see much this year or there really hasn't been much I've wanted to see. I kind of think it was that second thing.&nbsp; Also, I've been pretty busy with work (don't get me started on the family stuff). Way back last Monday, I got sent down to San Diego to follow the night search activities in the Chelsea King disappearance.&nbsp; She was still missing at the time.&nbsp; An initial arrest had been made, but her body hadn't been found yet. It was pretty grim.&nbsp; Sure, all the news people talked and socialized a bit in the area where we were all parked.&nbsp; Still, it just seemed like a dark and depressive evening. We were pretty close to the same area where David Westerfield and the parents of Danielle Van Dam lived.&nbsp; Danielle Van Dam was a nine year old girl that Westerfield was convicted of abducting and murdering. Reporter Greg Mills and I had a simple story to put together for the ten and eleven o'clock newscasts.&nbsp; There wasn't much to see from the media area that had been set up.&nbsp; There also weren't a lot of people around to question. Most of the people we had access to were friends and family of the missing girl and for the most part they weren't willing to be interviewed on camera. That makes our job a lot more difficult. One friend of the family told us off-camera that they were still holding out hope that Chelsea would be found alive. I learned the next day that Chelsea's body had been recovered from a shallow grave near the area of the search. That was my Monday. It's been a week of ups and downs. I'm still standing, but very happy that today is Friday.&nbsp; I see an ice cold beer in my future. Blogged with the Flock Browser Just a quick update. I'm in Hollywood hoping for a celebrity or two. Covering arrivals at a "green" carpet event. Posted via email from beFrank's posterous While passing through Temecula on the way to a story that will not likely end well, we saw this at a gas station. It made me smile. I'm thankful for that. I'm guessing there won't be many more of those tonight. -- Sent from my BlackBerry Posted via email from beFrank's posterous It's been a busy week.&nbsp; I&nbsp; could be posting a bit more, but most of the things I'd be inclined to write about aren't really news or photography related. Just so you know where I've been and what I've been working on, I'll try to post a few pictures and do some small bit of writing to put things in context. These shots were taken out at Huntington Beach because the city decided to remove a bunch of the fire pits that line the beach. I was working with Suzie Suh that night and I'll be honest.&nbsp; I didn't think we were going to find anybody out using the fire pits.&nbsp; The weather forecast was calling for rain, plus it's winter.&nbsp; Who in their right mind heads down to the beach in the rain in the cold of winter? No people?&nbsp; That would have made the story a bit more difficult to cover. As you can see from the previous pictures, there were people out making fires. The rain didn't hit as hard as I thought it might, but I did get caught by a light sprinkle. The rain chased away most of the bon fire bugs.&nbsp; We were left with drunken young people who might not have been old enough to be out drinking. At least they stayed close to their fire and pretty much ignored us. I'm kind of glad we were out doing this story now and that it wasn't a warm summer night.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we would have gotten more attention if that were the case. It was too cold and wet to screw with the media. Blogged with the Flock Browser
Light Bob blends effortlessly into his surroundings, Bossu Wood, Quatre Bras 1815. "I fight for the one true King...King Jesus!" There's a few things that really capture my imagination about the English Civil War. I love the look of the Buff coated troopers of both sides with their lobster pot helmets and breastplates. Also the massive, almost out of proportion pistols of the time really appeal to me. This grim faced veteran of Cromwell's 'iron sides' knows why he fights this war and has trusted his faith to God to see It through. Wellington's Imfamous army. I think for the other Command bases I will just mix up a bit of Green stuff rather than the tricky Poly Filler. The results will be the same and a lot easier to achieve. For the Command base I tried something a little different. Knowing how Poly filler can crack and flake when dry, I gave It a wash of PVA glue to fix It. It was quite time consuming but for Command bases I don't mind pushing the boat out a little. Gloss varnish was mixed with Scorched brown and a little black to make the wet looking mud. I made small hoof and footprints in the Poly Filler with a brush and dry brushed with shades of brown. Here is the first of my three command bases. To make It a bit more enjoyable for myself I painted them one at a time rather than en Mass. This allows me to see the results a lot quicker and Is more satisfying. I tried a few things out and settled for the quickest and easiest way, with so many bases to flock It had to be something effective but fast to do. This involved flocking the base as normal but as the PVA was still wet, I pushed a brush loaded with brown paint into it to make footprints. Puddles were created by exposing the flat base underneath, when this is painted dark brown and gloss varnished, It will give the effect of a muddy puddle. Very quick and very easy.

Hi internets. Just writing to introduce you to the newest "moderator" for the Camera Toss Group on flickr. Jens Ludwig aka QuakkauQ , hailing from Germany, has been a long time member and you've seen his excellent images all over this blog. Now he's joined David Hull aka mtnrockdhh to help keep the photo pool on topic and help ease new members into the idea of Camera Tossing. The photo in this post was created by Jens and shared with the group yesterday. Very fitting for an introduction post I thought. Jens also maintains his own site/domain about camera tossing, www.cameratossing.de , where he posts some of his photos and experiments, news, yet ANOTHER Camera Tossing, HOWTO , and hosts an invited 'friend's gallery' for other camera tossers he knows well. Jens is also the instigator of a collaborative project we are introducing to the community. I'll post more on that topic very soon. ;-) --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher I guess one of the behaviors of the new genre of subscriber/reader driven content and publishing in the magazine industry is the inevitability of covering the same topic more than once. ;-) JPG Magazine , which did a story (including interviews) on Camera Tossing in it's formative youth ( Issue 6 ), has pushed another Camera Toss article amusingly titled Get Fresh With Us: "Toss Your Camera" in Issue 16 . Apparently JPG thinks seconds are fresher than firsts? This one however takes the form of a very brief photo challenge posed to it's readers/photographers online, and a selection of voted/edited picks of the result. Basically it's the magazine version of my "Pool Picks" postings except with JPG contributers being the "pool", and without really providing any instructive context, history, or origins for the readers and contributors. Ironically there was a user contributed howto article on the subject linked from the challenge pages, but all that content was left unpublished in the printed article. In it's original posted form, their challenge didn't even get the concept/definition of a Camera Toss correct. I mean really folks, it's not that complicated. A couple of senior members in our community took it upon themselves to get them to at least honor the original concept and change the challenge criteria. Viewing the incoming submissions it became clear that many of their contributors were also missing the point , so a handful of our 5,000+ community members took it upon themselves to submit high quality camera tosses in an effort to notch up the presentation of the concept. Even still, the final published selection included some that were obviously not a thrown camera . But, almost all who submitted from our community made the published version. Congrats to them and way to show solidarity, something this labor union member/advocate certainly appreciates! ;-) (Left: by David Hull , Right: by Christian Kinzler , Lower: by Marce Garal ) Please don't read this post as a criticism of the photos/photographers actually published. Most were indeed camera tosses and many quite interesting to look at. I just feel the methodology for coming up with the content in the first place left a little bit to be desired in the way of substance and professionalism. Many JPG articles were great back in the days before they restructured , and some of them continue to be quite good, but I came away from this feeling like they just needed some space filler? Which, in itself is fine, but if you wish to showcase a technique, you should either give some great instructions or display some top quality work (ideally both?). Why else would you publish it, unless, perhaps your only aim is to make your own contributors (a.k.a. paying subscribers) feel good about themselves? So three cheers to Derek and Heather for honoring our little niche of the photography universe with their original article, instructions, and interviews! (View online here ) This second time around? Not so much. As for the current editorial staff of JPG Magazine. If you wish to produce "fresh" content. Figure out a way to get your article/theme contributors to do their homework. A little tried and true journalism wouldn't hurt either. I'm sure you would have had an amazing spread if you popped into our forums and solicited the community to contribute (exactly what was done for the Issue 6 article ). How's that for "getting fresh with you" ? ;-) Maybe by fresh you didn't mean "snarky". Oh well. ;-) Links Related to this Posting: Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (and all submissions) Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (published contact-sheet) JPG Magazine Issue 16 Unpublished JPG user contributed HOWTO JPG Magazine Issue 6 Article (instructions, interviews, commentary) Camera Toss Group on Flickr --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher And now for a long... long...

Again, Lights Out San Francisco was a huge success, thanks to all of you! We'd also like to extend a special thank you to the photographers who took some amazing before and after photos for us . If you liked what you saw in Dolores Park last Saturday, check out what else Teacher with the Bus has to offer. Building off of all the positive responses we've received from folks across the country and even around the world, we're moving forward with Lights Out America . Please join us in taking it to the next level by participating in Lights Out America on March 29th, 2008! A big thanks to all who participated in Lights Out last night! We are especially grateful to Jens-Peter Jungclaussen the Teacher With The Bus and all of our volunteers who made the event a great success. We had a good time in Dolores Park, and we hope that you had some fun in the dark too. Here are some photos from before and during the event at Dolores: Ok this is very cool...our friends at Google have "turned out the lights" on their homepage for users in the Bay Area. I can see it but some friends are not seeing it yet. It may take some time for the page to find its way to all the local servers? They have written a special page for us as well: http://www.google.com/lightsoutsf/ Thanks Google! Turn off your lights from 8-9pm and do one of the following, or think up your own way to make good things happen in the dark! -Treat yourself (and someone else) to a candlelight dinner at one of our participating restaurants . -Help us out by taking photos and emailing them to pictures@lightsoutsf.org . -JOIN US IN DOLORES PARK FOR FREE MUSIC!!! Yet another signal of support from our fearless leader in Sacramento. Governor Schwarzenegger shares his support for Lights Out San Francisco. He calls it an "illuminating" event! We just learned that our very own, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi issued a statement in support of Lights Out. Thanks very much for the support... -------------------------------- Pelosi Statement on Lights Out San Francisco Washington, D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued the following statement regarding Lights Out San Francisco, a city-wide conservation event in which organizers are inviting the entire San Francisco community to install one compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) and turn off all non-essential lighting from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.: "Climate change presents a challenge to the survival of our planet. While there is an urgent need for decisive action to address climate change and greenhouse gas reduction nationally and globally, we must act locally as well. "Solutions to the climate crisis must be as local as our neighborhoods and as global as the planet. By taking part in Lights Out San Francisco, each resident will be taking a positive step towards reducing green house gases emissions on a local level. "Thank you to the visionary organizers of Lights Out San Francisco and to the many businesses, residents and visitors who will participate in turning out the lights in San Francisco and helping to reduce the energy consumption in our city." This just in. Our good friends at Craigslist posted a link from their homepages in San Francisco and LA. Thanks guys...this will definitely help raise awareness of our event and save energy. A big thanks to Raymond, Ryan and their friends at Holy Name School! They helped us pass out CFLs and information about LOSF at their elementary school. You guys have been a great help!
I missed you. Did you miss me? First things first: I'm not dead. Although I have to admit I get a sick little thrill when I imagine the idea of my being referred to as such. Clearly there is something wrong with me; I generally rely on the "Comments" section to begin to figure out what that something is. I would love to tell you that I was on some ashram for a year and a half, fixing my life and learning the true meaning of Christmas, etc., but I wasn't. I did get my J.D., finally. Two law firms, a lot of snooze-bars, tardiness, absenteeism, subpar legal work and a generous severance package later, here I am--gainfully employed again. For now. Tomorrow, in fact, is the day that we're all expecting to get laid off on account of the financial crisis. Of course it will only be about 10% of the Firm's associates, but I can't imagine I won't be among them. How do I know? Lawyers at firms are notorious for their reticence about criticizing an attorney's work product. They're generally not a confrontational lot. But I've gotten several talkings-to in my very brief tenure here: "We're troubled by this." "Is everything ok?" "You really need to pay more attention to detail." "Please review, on a non-billable basis, what I ultimately sent to the client and compare it to the draft you sent me." These are all bona fide clues. But what really does it that the secretaries on my floor can't even look me in the eye. They are the ones with the worst poker faces (get it, ha ha). They see me showing up at 10am most mornings and leaving at 1:30 with my laptop bag, feigning some sort of work-related hurry. The ones with a maternal instinct probably worry a little bit; the other ones probably think I am a little such-and-such. Of course, I am a little such-and-such is the thing, but I still resent their knowing it. On the bright side, I've got some dollars in the bank. But I really can think of only one thing to do with those dollars, and I can assure you it's not to set up responsible payment plans with my increasingly vocal roster of creditors. I will talk more about money in the next one I post, which will be sometime before 2011, I promise. A year after I started this very self-aware project, and what do you suppose has changed? I don't gamble or want to gamble nearly as much as I used to. Big deal. If you ever thought this blog was about gambling, you sort of missed the point, I think. Although I'm grateful to all the poker players and what have you who found me in the past year. But it's not about those things. Even if I thought that it was about them when I started writing. So what then? It's about the void. It's about self-destructive compulsions. People pick at scabs even though they know they shouldn't. Or fail to wash their hands after urinating. We all know we should. Some of us don't. Why? Is it just laziness? I think it's not just laziness. To wit: I've faked washing them for the benefit of others within earshot, which requires just as much effort as just lathering up, rinsing, and drying for real. I offer to you, the 15 people who still check in from time to time, the sum of my wisdom: some people don't wash their hands because they want desperately to test the notion that "bad" actions don't always have consequences, and neither do "good" actions, for that matter. In other words, a test of the basic tenets of what I'll call moral physics-- namely, that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. Some of us would be condemned by such a literal correspondence between actions and outcomes. And so we quietly resist: by not brushing after meals and still expecting to not get a cavity; by not doing our homework and still hoping to pass our classes; by playing a game we're doomed to lose and still praying to win. There is a kind of bravery in it, don't you suppose? I just made an awful realization about myself. Awful enough to warrant my return to the internets. I'd been clean for a while, you know. Just twenty minutes ago, I was lying on my couch with the sun in my eyes, too inept with the mechanics of vertical blinds to keep it out. I was mulling my options about what to do with the remainder of a Sunday afternoon. The television was tempting, but again, this time of day was bad -- too sunny, too inept. The glare would prove unbearable. I scrolled through my cell phone's address book. Someone to call? I didn't really want to make plans with anyone, mind you. I wouldn't want anyone to see me like this -- unshaven and disheveled. I just wanted someone to text message with. Preferably a pretty girl. Something to distract me, if only momentarily. Distract me from what, you ask? The Realization. That is, the realization that I don't enjoy doing anything. I have no hobbies. Nothing that doesn't involve gambling (or at least uncertainty) interests me. Since I am not supposed to gamble anymore, I'm a complete waste of space. Ever the resilient one, I've found a cheaper and less satisfying alternative -- writing bizarre messages on craigslist.org and match.com, pleas for help, inflammatory poems, anything that might incite someone to write back. Sometimes on match.com, after reading the tenth amazingly vapid 'portrait' in a row, I just start sending emails bitterly mocking them. That this sort of behavior fills the void that I used to fill by playing cards is noteworthy, I think. I am not putting anything at risk -- no money, obviously, but not even my ego. It's entirely anonymous. So I was never a risk junkie after all. I am a feedback junkie. I crave the moment when I realize that I have something to read from a stranger. Preferably a pretty girl. It's got nothing to do with making a connection with someone. It's got everything to do with snapping me out of the boredom of sheer radio silence. It's a reminder that I am not dead yet. It gives me a way to keep score, to measure success and self-worth. Especially when it's from a pretty girl. Don't most people crochet, or play golf, or go to museums to have fun? I wish those were fun for me. If I can't get my dose of uncertainty, rejection, acceptance, excitement, self-esteem from gambling, then I'm going to get it from person-shopping on the internet. Sadly, the ones who write back are usually overweight amd live in the suburbs with their parents. And that just makes me more depressed. God, I pity them so much. Before we got rolling toward K.C., Natalie tapped the dashboard. "We need to fill this bad-boy up! Serious fillage ." Even at this relatively early juncture, I had become entirely accustomed to her idiosyncratic grammar and syntax. She spotted a gas station adjacent to the southbound entrance to the interstate. After some fumbling with the credit card, the pump and the nozzle, we were ready. It was nearly dusk. She did the driving, while I navigated. "South for a while. Mostly southwest," I announced, once we'd safely merged into the flow of traffic. "So just down and over, right?" "Down and over? Right, down and over." Beginning a road trip of considerable distance with a relative stranger at this dangerous time of day gave me pause. The headlights hadn't completely taken full effect and it was hard for me to see. I figured it was hard for Natalie to see. Then she confirmed my suspicions. "Whoa. It's hard to freakin' see. Twilight and glare or whatever." "Uh huh." In order to distract us from these annoynaces -- twilight? glare? whatever? -- Natalie directed her attention to the car radio, to find some tunes. Tuneage . All eyes turned to the radio. It was one that had come standard with the car, this powder blue monstrosity, this 1983 Oldsmobile Toronado in which we would soon die our fiery deaths. Its pre-sets were shiny metallic buttons, spring-loaded so when you press a button, the one that was originally depressed comes popping out of its socket with a vehemence you can feel and hear. Snap-click. Anyone with half a brain when encountering such a contraption would try to hold down two of the buttons at once, just to see what might happen. "That's how things get broken." "Uh huh." If I were to remove this gaudy button, there'd be nothing but a small plate with tiny copper hooks on either end -- one end held the plate to the aforementioned gaudy exterior buttons; the other end attached, ostensibly, to the radio's internal wiring. The shiny metal on the pre-set buttons was, as far as I could tell, there primarily to provide the passenger with some sense of psychological remove between the button itself (merely a symbol, really) and the mechanism, raw and cold, that lay underneath it. "And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile. And you may find yourself in another part of the world." We sang along. I am thrilled to be back in a position to write more blog entries. I was involved in a pretty big misunderstanding in Kansas City, Missouri. Before the Kansas City fiasco will make any sense, though, you will have to know who Natalie is. Last week, Natalie cut my hair at the local middle-brow hair salon chain, and we got to chatting the way stylists and clients will do, and I realized about five minutes into the conversation two things: (1) most of what was coming out of my mouth was utterly false; and (2) Natalie was interested. I told her that I was on a medical leave from my job in Houston, at NASA. "What do you do for NASA?" "I'm an astronaut." She pulled the scissors away. "Psha! Shut up!" I shut up. "Seriously?" "Well, no, But it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. I do work for them, for NASA, on a contract basis. Mostly p.r. consulting, which is a year-round thing but gets especially hectic whenever there's a launch or a landing or anything. At more off-peak times, I call my friends at the newspapers, magazines, and the wire services and feed them 'feel-good' stories about the space program. Seriously." "That's awesome." "What I tell people is that it's basically 40 hours a week trying to make the general public like rocket scientists." "I don't know, rocket scientists seem pretty likable to me as it is." "Well, obviously I'm good at what I do, then." Whenever I get bored and restless, whenever the prospect of going to bed at 9:30 terrifies me, I decide that I should either gamble or go to a bar. Each offers such marvelous unknowns and opportunities. This is well-covered territory. So the other night I went to a local pub and had a few drinks. Alone. Watched the crowd. Fiddled with my cell phone. Pretended that someone was calling me, so as to allay my self-consciousness about being alone in a bar. I wanted to leave. I uttered some fake parting words to a friend who didn't exist to a cell phone that was off. I paid $6 for my beer. Then I got the bright idea to take a cab to the only strip club I know about in this whole city. I knew it was a terrible idea, and an awful waste of my rather limited resources, but o, the possibilities! Now, the interesting part: I hopped in a cab and told the driver the approximate intersection. I commented on the bouquet of roses that he had, bizarrely, attached to the dashboard. He didn't hear me. I repeated, "North and Kingsbury." "V.I.P.'s? You going to V.I.P.'s?" My reflex on this evening, as it was on many evenings previous, was to lie. "Oh, no. I'm not going there. That is a fun place though. Just here at the corner, that's fine." And so he dropped me off and began to execute his U-turn and get back to a main thoroughfare. I began to cross the street and make my toward the neon, the techno, the cheap-looking silhouettes. I took two steps and realized that if I continued toward the club in plain view of the cabbie, I'd be confirming his (well founded) suspicion that I am a sleaze-bag who had just lied to him. So I changed course. I yawned. Nonchalance is key. I pretended to get another phone call again, and I walked briskly. Purposefully. Away from the club. Once the brakelights of the cab had gone safely over the hill about a quarter of a mile away, I figured the coast was clear. So I made a 180-degree turn and retraced my steps toward the club. I don't feel like telling you any gambling stories today. The sun is shining, the unreasonably loud construction outside of my apartment has ceased, and I feel good. I am eating healthier foods and taking better care of myself. I don't know why. Part of it is simple. I'm so tired of gambling. I can finally see a way to where the pursuit of action won't be irresistible. I really can. Mostly because I'm just flat exhausted. But that's where I have to stop. Because if I continue this thread, it's only trouble for me. Trouble because I start to realize that I have nothing with which to replace the monkey on my back, except maybe for a new monkey. (Alcohol? Drugs? Hookers? Greasy foods? I don't know, what else are people addicted to?) I'll make it as plain as I can: I have thus far been successful in making the idea of gambling utterly undesirable to me. That alone seems like a worthy achievement. But concomitant with that success is my realization that nothing else in life is all that desirable to me, either. It's as if -- in my haste to eradicate the gambling disease from my heart, my soul, my nervous system, whatever -- I've gone ahead and deadened everything -- including my ability to fathom that I live in a world from which I might derive enjoyment. So you tell me which is worse. Last Monday, I received something suspicious in the mail. It was a rumpled manila envelope to which electrical tape was nonsensically applied. There was no return address, but instead a cryptic "respondez si vous plait" in the upper-left corner. I hadn't been expecting any packages from psychopaths, so I thought twice about opening it. Anthrax? A letter bomb, maybe? I couldn't be certain. "Maybe someone out there thinks I'm worth more dead than alive," I wondered aloud, eyeing the lumpy, brown parcel. It was a flattering notion, in a way. It was a very film noir -ish line to deliver, and I think I nailed it on the first take. Never mind for the moment that the proposition itself was utterly false. Even if it were theoretically true that my value as a dead person exceeds my value alive, I reasoned that either value was probably less than that of the postage. Simultaneously emboldened and deflated by this realization, I tore the package open and braced myself for the worst. Enclosed was a homemade t-shirt, emblazoned with a fairly crass pun using the name of the boarding school that I attended. Also, a bus ticket from here to a New England Town, where the school is located and where the senders of this parcel still reside. They wanted me to go out there for the coming weekend. An informal reunion of former roommates, friends, and whatnot. They thought they'd have to entice me with gifts. They were right. Some are beginning their medical residencies. Others are working at financial services firms. They have nylon laptop bags with their firms' logos on them. They wear golf shirts. Most are engaged or already married. I don't have to explain to you why this is awkward. Most of them know my situation. In fact, one of them came up with the idea of the reunion because he saw this blog, put two and two together, and wanted to check in. He was good enough to keep the discovery of the blog to himself, or so he assures me. It's not awkward merely because these people have more money than me, or because they've done more with their lives than me thus far, although neither is ever comfortable. It's the little things. It's that their clothes just seem to sit right on their bodies more than mine do. They wear baseball caps that just look right on their heads. My head seems like it's a weird shape compared to theirs. None of them wears eyeglasses. I do. Their hair is straight and looks sort of conventional. Respectable. Never too unruly, even if it gets windy outside. Mine always looks a little off. Their teeth are white. They are in better shape than me. They are good at their jobs. Was my growth irrevocably stunted somehow? Why do these little things come so easily to them? How come, for instance, they're not even interested in eating the fortune cookies at the Chinese restaurant? I always feel like such a child when I'm the only one who eats mine as we deliberate about the size of the tip. I don't own a pair of sunglasses, but if I did it would
't occur to me to hang them nonchalantly off the collar of my Polo shirt. But these guys make it work. I don't even have a driver's license. I guess I just never learned how.
NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD.I've been ordering prints for a gallery showing this past week and I accidentally ordered one of the prints without matting (it's professionally framed and mounted to styrene, just not matted).  Whoops!  If you want the above framed 10"x15" print of the Aurora Borealis over a barn in Nebraska and are the first person to email me, you can have it for $60 with free shipping to anywhere in the United States.  The usual price for this is $140 for just the print alone ($190 for framed), so it's a huge discount.  Again, if you're interested, email digicana@gmail.com -- there's only one, so first come, first serve! BTW, the shadows of the trees on the barn are a bit of a funny story -- they weren't visible to the naked eye when taking the picture and only showed up later in the photo.  They are caused by the distant light of Lincoln, Nebraska reflecting off of a cloud over the city; the lit up cloud was bright enough to cast a shadow in the long exposure.NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD. Here's an old favorite from near Comstock, Nebraska.  This storm put down a quarter mile wide tornado about 20 or 30 minutes before this was shot -- here it is moving off into the distance.  Sometimes the "golden hour" light of a setting sun into a storm can create incredibly beautiful vistas that seem straight out of an apocalypse.
Civil Court's Jurisdiction - Companies Bill, 2009? - Corporate Law Articles - Chartered Accountants India,Taxpayers, CAs India, CA india ,ICAI, Company Secretary ,CS, Cost Accountants, MBA, Finance Professionals by Durga Rao We all aware that there is no express provision barring the Civil Courts to entertain certain company disputes under the Companies Act, 1956. We have been seeing the cases where the Civil Court entertains Company disputes if there is no specific remedial measure before the Company Law Board or the Company Court . The issue of Civil Court’s Jurisdiction to entertain certain company matters is also supported by the Constitutional Courts on the ground that there is no specific bar under the existing Companies Act, 1956 barring the Civil Courts in entertaining Company matters and on the ground that the Companies Act, 1956 do no provide all remedial measures to all the shareholders before the Company Law Board or the Company Court. It is true that adjudicating a company dispute requires specialization and the Civil Court may not effectively adjudicate a Company dispute. We are all aware of the inevitable complications under Company Law. Laudably, an effort has been made to bar the Civil Court ’s jurisdiction to entertain company matters in the Companies Bill, 2009 or in the proposed new Companies Act replacing Companies Act, 1956. Section 391 of the Companies Bill, 2009 dealing with the Civil Court ’s Jurisdiction is extracted below: “391. No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal is empowered to determine by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force by the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal”. The object of section 391 in the proposed Companies Act is to exclude the Civil Courts in entertaining company disputes and to avoid the jurisdictional ambiguity. Under the existing Companies Act, 1956, shareholders who are qualified to approach the Company Law Board under section 397/398 may choose to approach the Civil Court rather the Company Law Board. In CDS Financial Services (Mauritius) Limited Vs. BPL Communications Limited and others, (2004) 121 Comp Cases 375 , it was held that “when there is no express provision excluding the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts, such exclusion can be implied only in cases where a right itself is created and the machinery of enforcement of such right is also provided by the statute. If the right is traceable to the general law of contracts or it is a common law right, it can be enforced through the Civil Court, even though the forum under the statute also will have jurisdiction to enforce that right. Sections 397, 398 and 408 of the Companies Act, 1956, do not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the company court to grant reliefs against oppression and mismanagement. The scope of these sections is to provide a convenient remedy for minority shareholders under certain conditions and the provisions therein are not intended to exclude all other remedies”. Now, with the express bar under section 391 of the proposed act, if a remedy is available before the National Company Law Tribunal etc. then, no Civil Court can entertain a suit. But we need to address an issue as to what is the situation if a particular relief is not available to the shareholders before the National Company Law Tribunal or under the new Companies Act? Under such circumstances, despite section 391 in the proposed Companies Act, it may be very difficult to bar the Civil Courts in entertaining Company Disputes or it may be difficult to lay down a proposition that no shareholder can approach the Civil Court against the managerial personnel, the management or the Company. It is true that the Civil Court may not be effective like the proposed National Company Law Tribunal, but, when a remedy is not provided before the Tribunal, the shareholders will obviously be approaching the Civil Courts and it may even be supported by the Constitutional Courts in future. It is true that the Civil Courts jurisdiction is effectively barred under certain enactments like Securitization Law and it is not usual to see a Civil Court to entertain a dispute under Securitization Act upon which the Debt Recovery Tribunal shall have jurisdiction. It is possible under the Securitization Law in view of the limited scope of the subject matter. Under Securitization Law, it is only about the determination of debt or the legality of the action taken by the Bank under the Act. Only the Bank, the borrowers, the guarantors and in some cases a third party, is interested in a securitization case, but, that is not the case with a Company litigation. The Company Law Board, Company Court or the National Company Law Tribunal as the case may be should consider many issues before passing an order in a Company dispute. In my opinion, it is very difficult to bar the Civil Court ’s jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed Company’s bill or the new act. In order to achieve the objective of barring the Civil Court’s Jurisdiction effectively, we need a detailed provision barring the Civil Court’s Jurisdiction and there should be a provision similar to section 151 of C.P.C in the proposed Companies Act giving liberty to the shareholders or the members to approach the Tribunal for the relief which is not specifically provided under the Act. If there is such an arrangement under the proposed Act, the National Company Law Tribunal shall decide the maintainability of the applications or the petitions and can pass appropriate orders. I am sure that it is very difficult to bar the Civil Court ’s Jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed bill or the proposed new Companies Act. There tend to be lot of litigation on the issue of Civil Court’s Jurisdiction even after the new Companies Act coming into force replacing Companies Act, 1956.

Her advocate, G N Salunke, told the court Wednesday that not one Muslim family lives in a radius of 1 km from the site and only 331 Muslim families live beyond that radius. “If the mosque is allowed there is every possibility of encroachment on the public open premises in the locality by Muslim encroachers which may badly affect the development of the city,” says the petition, heard by a division bench of Justice F I Rebello and Justice J H Bhatia. “So minorities cannot have their own place of worship? This intolerance has to go. Either we should live together or pack our bags and go,” the bench said. Kadu contends she is a project-affected person and 12.5 per cent of the area was reserved for their rehabilitation which has not been completed yet. Her lawyer said the police commissioner has repeatedly stated there is likely to be a law-and-order problem if construction of the mosque is allowed, yet CIDCO has handed over the plot to the trustees of the mosque. “Public in the locality is very much annoyed and aggressive and there is every possibility to riot and in law-and-order point of view the allotment is required to be cancelled,” the PIL states. It says the trustees are neither project-affected persons nor residents of Sector 50E. The construction of the mosque, it says, will affect the construction of a college the land was reserved for. The plot is also a mangroves bed but permission has not been sought to hack it, the PIL adds. The court directed CIDCO to file an affidavit and submit a map of the area in two weeks. The court also told Salunke and the CIDCO counsel to come up with a workable solution. Types of grievances brought u/s 482 Cr.P.C.

Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Anr., pronounced on 15.02.2010 has laid down guidelines to determine vicarious liability of directors of Company. The SC has significantly narrowed down the liability of directors. It was held that only those to be held responsible who were in charge of the conduct of business at that relevant time. The Apex Court held that from the provisions of Section 141 NI Act, it is clear that that the persons who are sought to be made vicariously liable for a criminal offence under Section 141 should be, at the time the offence was committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. Only those persons who were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. It follows from the fact that if a Director of a Company who was not in- charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable for a criminal offence under the provisions. The liability arises from being in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company. The Apex Court further observed that Section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald cursory statement in a complaint that the Accused Director is in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more as to the role of the Director. But the complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner the accused director was in-charge of or was responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its business. This is in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability. A company may have a number of Directors and to make any or all the Directors as accused in a complaint merely on the basis of a statement that they are in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more is not a sufficient or adequate fulfillment of the requirements under Section 141. The Apex reiterated its own catena of decisions, in which it has held that for making Directors liable for the offences committed by the company under Section 141 of the Act, there must be specific averments against the Directors, showing as to how and in what manner the Directors were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. The Supreme Court after reiterating its own judicial pronouncements in various decisions laid down the following principles: (i) The primary responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as are required under the law in the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable. For fastening the criminal liability, there is no presumption that every Director knows about the transaction. (ii) Section 141 does not make all the Directors liable for the offence. The criminal liability can be fastened only on those who, at the time of the commission of the offence, were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. (iii) Vicarious liability can be inferred against a company registered or incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 only if the requisite statements, which are required to be averred in the complaint/petition, are made so as to make accused therein vicariously liable for offence committed by company along with averments in the petition containing that accused were in-charge of and responsible for the business of the company and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (iv) Vicarious liability on the part of a person must be pleaded and proved and not inferred. (v) If accused is Managing Director or Joint Managing Director then it is not necessary to make specific averment in the complaint and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (vi) If accused is a Director or an Officer of a company who signed the cheques on behalf of the company then also it is not necessary to make specific averment in complaint. (vii) The person sought to be made liable should be in- charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a Director in such cases. Source : Recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of National Small Industries Corp. Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Anr . Right To Bail In India When you are arrested, you are taken into custody. This means that you are not free to leave the scene. Without being arrested, you can be detained, however, or held for questioning for a short time if a police officer or other person believes you may be involved in a crime. For example, an officer may detain you if you are carrying a large box near a burglary site. You can also be detained by storekeepers if they suspect you have stolen something. Whether you are arrested or detained, you do not have to answer any questions except to give your name and address and show some identification if requested. The object of arrest and detention of the accessed person is primarily to secure his appearance at the trial and to ensure that in case he is found guilty he is available to receive the sentence. If his presence at the trial could be reasonable ensured otherwise than by his arrest and detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during the pendency of the crimin
l proceedings against him. The provisions regarding the issue of summons or those relating to the arrest of the accessed person under a warrant or without a warrant or those relating to the release of the accessed at his trial but without unreasonable and unjustifiably interfering with his liberty. Thus this article is related with the provisions related with the release of a person on a bail. In words of Krishna Iyer J. .. the subject of bail:- " ..... belongs to the blurred area of criminal justice system and largely hinges on the hunch of the bench, otherwise called judicial discretion. The Code is cryptic on this topic and the Court prefers to be tacit, be the order custodial or not. And yet, the issue is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden of public treasury all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitised judicial process." Thus release on bail is crucial to the accused as the consequences of pre-trial detention are given. If release on bail is denied to the accessed it would mean that though he is presumed to be innocent till the guilt is proved beyond the reasonable doubt he would be subjected to the psychological and physical deprivation of jail life. The jail accessed loses his job and is prevented from contributing effectively to the preparation of his defense. Therefore where there are no risks involved in the release of the arrested person it would be cruel and unjust, to deny him bail. The law bails " has to dovetail two conflicting demands namely, on one hand, the requirements of the society for being shielded from the hazards of being exposed to the misadventures of a person alleged to have committed a crime; and on the other, the fundamental canon of criminal jurisprudence. The presumption of innocence of an accused till he is found guilty". In order to sub serve the above said objective, the Legislature in its wisdom has given precise directions for granting or granting bail. Why Bail? Before actually determining the place of bail within human rights framework as conferred by the Constitution, it is important to examine the object and meaning of bail, such that an analysis of these fundamental objects and change therein may reveal a change. The object detention of an accused person is primarily to secure her/his appearance at the time of trial and is available to receive sentence, in case found guilty. If his/her presence at the trial could be reasonably ensured other than by his arrest or detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during pendency of criminal proceedings. Thus it is important to note the relevant provisions enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:- Article 9- No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. Article 10- Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him. Article 11(1)- Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense. There are thus several reasons which have been enumerated as to why bail ought to be allowed to prevent pre-trial detention MEANING OF BAIL Bail, in law, means procurement of release from prison of a person awaiting trial or an appeal, by the deposit of security to ensure his submission at the required time to legal authority. "Bail has been defined in the law lexicon as security for the appearance of the accused person on giving which he is released pending trial or investigation." According to Black's Law Dictionary, what is contemplated by bail is to "procure the release of a person from legal custody, by undertaking that he/she shall appear at the time and place designated and submit him/herself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court.". MEANING OF BAIL IN INDIA According to Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr.P.C. hereinafter), does not define bail, although the terms bailable offense and non-bailable offense have been defined in section 2(a) Cr.P.C. as follows: " Bailable offense means an offense which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being enforce, and non-bailable offense means any other offense". That schedule refers to all the offenses under the Indian Penal Code and puts them into bailable and on bailable categories. The analysis of the relevant provisions of the schedule would show that the basis of this categorization rests on diverse consideration. However, it can be generally stated that all serious offenses, i.e. offenses punishable with imprisonment for three years or more have seen considered as non bailable offenses. Further, Sections 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. The amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the Cr.P.C. Thus, it is the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond. Indian Courts however ,have greater discretion to grant or deny bail in the case of persons under criminal arrest, e.g., it is usually refused when the accused is charged with homicide. It must be further noted that a person accused of a bailable offenses is arrested or detained without warrant he has a right to be released on bail. But if the offense is non-bailable that does not mean that the person accused of such offense shall not be released on bail: but here in such case bail is not a matter of right, but only a privilege to be granted at the discretion of the court. Provisions under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, makes provisions for release of accused persons on bail. Section 436 of the Code provides for release on bail in cases of bailable offenses. Section 436 provides that when person not accused of a non-bailable offense is arrested or detained he can be detained as right to claim to be released on bail. The section covers all cases of person s accused of bailable of fences cases of persons though not accused of any offense but against whom security proceedings have been initiated under Chapter VIII of the Code and other cases of arrest and detention which are not in respect of any bailable offense. This section entitles a person other than the accused of a non-bailable offense to be released on bail, it may be recalled that S. 50(2) makes it obligatory for a police officer arresting such a person without a warrant to inform him his right to be released on bail. Section 436 (1) of the Code signifies that release on bail is a matter of right, or in other words, the officer-in-charge of a police station or any court does not have any discretion whatsoever to deny bail in such cases. The word " appear in this sub- clause is wide enough to include voluntary appearance of the person accused of an offense even where no summons or warrant has been issued against him. There is nothing in S. 436 to exclude voluntary appearance or to suggest that the appearance of the accused must be in the obedience of a process issued by the court. The surrender and the physical presence of the accused with the submission to the jurisdiction and order of the court is judicial custody, and the accused may be granted bail and released from such custody. The right to be released on bail under S. 436(1) cannot be nullified indirectly by fixing too high amount of bond or bail-bond to be furnish by the person seeking bail. Section 440(1) provides the amount of every bond executed under this chapter shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case, and shall not be excessive. Further S. 440(2) empowers the High Court or the Court of Sessions may direct that the bail required by a police officer or Magistrate be reduced. Sub-section (2) of S. 436 makes a provision to effect that a person who absconds or has broken the condition of his bail bond when released on bail is a bailable case on a previous occasion, shall not as of right to be entitled to bail when brought before the court on any subsequent date even though the offense may be bailable. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [1978] 2 SCR 621 The amount of the bond should be determined having regard to these relevant factors and should not be fixed mechanically according to a schedule keyed to the nature of the charge. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the accused to secure his release even by executing a personal bond, it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court-and what is said in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail-that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited. The inquiry into the solvency of the accused can become a source of great harassment to him and often resulting denial of bail and deprivation of liberty and should not, therefore, be insisted upon as a condition of acceptance of the personal bond. It also stated that there is a need to provide by an amendment of the penal law that if an accused willfully fails to appear incompliance with the promise contained in his personal bond, he shall be liable to penal action. J. Per Bhagwati &amp; Koshal, JJ. further observed that it is now high time that the State Government realized its responsibility to the people in the matter of administration of justice and set up more courts for the trial of cases. In Moti Ram &amp; Others. v. State of M.P [1978] 4 SCC 47 Urgent need for a clear and explicit provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the release, inappropriate cases, of an under trial prisoner on his bond without sureties and without any monetary obligation. Criminal courts today, are extremely unsatisfactory and needs drastic change. In the first place it is virtually impossible to translate risk of non- appearance by the accused into precise monetary terms and even its basic premise that risk of financial loss is necessary to prevent the accused from fleeing is of doubtful validity. There are several considerations which deter an accused from running away from justice and risk of financial loss is only one of them and that too not a major one. In this case the court also pointed out the enlightened Bail Projects in the United States such as Manhattan Bail Project and D. C. Bail Project shows that even without monetary bail it has been possible to secure the presence of the accused at the trial in quite a large number of cases. The Court laid down following guidelines, that determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing, the Court should take into account the following factors concerning the accused: 1. The length of his residence in the community, 2 His employment status, history and his financial condition, 3. His family ties and relationships, 4 His reputation, character and monetary condition, 5.His prior criminal record including any record or prior release on recognizance or on bail, 6. The identity of responsible members of the community who would vouch for his reliability. The nature of the offense charged and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence in so far as these factors are relevant to the risk of non appearance, and If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non-appearance, the accused may, as far as possible, be released on his personal bond. Of course, if facts are brought to the notice of the court which go to show that having regard to the condition and background of the accused his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offense, there may be a substantial risk of his non-appearance at the trial, as for example, where the accused is a notorious bad character or confirmed criminal or the offense is serious (these examples are only by way of illustration), the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties. But in the majority of cases, considerations like family ties and relationship, roots in the community, employment status etc. may prevail with the court in releasing the accused on his personal bond and particularly in cases where the offense is not grave and the accused is poor or belongs to a weaker section of the community, release on personal bond could, as far as possible, be preferred. But even while releasing the accused on personal bond it is necessary to caution the court that the amount of the bond which it. Section 436A . Maximum period for which an under trial prisoner can be detained - The new provision Section 436Awas introduced in order to solve the problems of undertrials' who were languishing in jails as they will now be given an opportunity to be set free instead of endlessly waiting for their trial to take place. This move has been made due to a faulty criminal justice system and provides a makeshift method of providing justice and relief to undertrial prisoners. This seems to suggest that the Legislature and the Government have accepted the existence of the faulty system and their inability to do anything about it. For this purpose section 436 A was inserted. According to S. 436-A, a person who has undergone detention for a period extending upto half of the maximum period of imprisonment imposed for a particular offense, shall be released on her/his personal bond with or without sureties. The procedure provided is that the Court has to hear the Public Prosecutor and give its decision with reasons in writing. The Court may release the applicant, or if not satisfied may order for the continued detention of the applicant. However, no prisoner can be detained for a period longer than the maximum period of imprisonment provided. The exception to the section is that it is not applicable to offenders who have been sentenced to death. Moving onto the (de)merits of the provisions itself, S. 436-A gives discretion to the Court to set the prisoner free or to make him/her continue imprisonment. There is no mention of any applications having to be filed under the section. The first part of the section states that any prisoner who has served more than half the term of his/her imprisonment 'shall' be released. However, the proviso puts a restriction on the mandatory provision by giving discretionary powers to the courts. This raises questions regarding the implementation of the provision. There is every chance that a prisoner may be sent back to jail to serve a period longer than the half term of his/her sentence. Till the Judges give their written reasons for the same, one will not know on what grounds a continuation of the term can be ordered as the section does not provide any guidelines. Will the undertrial prisoner continue to serve term till the maximum period of the Granting of Bail with conditions Section 437 of the Code provides for release on bail in cases of non-bailable offenses. In such cases, bail is not a matter of right. Court has sufficient discretion to deny or to grant bail. First Schedule to the Code provides the list of bailable and non-bailable offenses. Further cases often arise under S. 437, where though the court regards the case as fit for the grant of bail, it regards imposition of certain conditions as necessary in the circumstances. To meet this need sub-section (3) of S. 437 provides: When a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offense punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offense under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offense, is released on bail under sub-section (1), the Court may impose any condition which the Court considers necessary: - (a)In order to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, or (b)In order to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused o

Well, it's commonly&nbsp; known as the Gherkin and I've blogged about it before here . The building is in fact the home of Swiss Re , who are the Worlds second largest re-insurer. Founded in 1863, Swiss Re operates through offices in more than 25 countries. 30 St Mary Axe , also known as the Gherkin and the Swiss Re Building , is a skyscraper in London's, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004. It is 180 metres (591 ft) tall, with 40 floors. Its construction symbolised the start of a new high-rise construction boom in London. The building was designed by Lord Foster, his then business partner Ken Shuttleworth and Arup engineers, and was constructed by Skanska of Sweden in 2001–2004. The gherkin name dates back to at least 1999, referring to that plan's highly unorthodox layout and appearance. Due to the current building's somewhat phallic appearance, other inventive names have also been used for the building, including the Erotic gherkin, the Towering Innuendo, and the Crystal Phallus (also a pun on Crystal Palace). &nbsp; Read more of the Wikipedia article here .

She’s arguably the hottest star in the music world right now, thanks to her amazing dance beats and wilder than life stage persona, and now, Lady Gaga brings crustaceans to the limelight... Much cooler than the last crustacean-inspired headwear. Spotted at The Daily Mail . Over the last few months, there has been much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about strategy and tactics over how to communicate with non-scientists, and how to regain public trust over issues like climate change . A good example of this was a recent email exchange between Matt Nisbet and Randy Olson . Nisbet: When scientists... take action by responding with tit-for-tat attacks on climate skeptics, it... feeds a downward spiral of “war” and conflict rhetoric that appears as just more ideological rancor to the wider public. Olson: There comes a point where the public DOES want to see the science community stand up for themselves. People arguing that scientists are losing to denialists in areas like climate science because they have taken a poor approach to communication are perhaps mischaracterizing the problem. The problem of what approach scientists use to communicate with non-scientists is a real problem, but it is minuscule in these cases. Scientists have to, you know, do science in addition to communication with non-scientists. Denialists, as far as I can tell, can devote 100% of their time to communication. If scientists want to win, we need to find a way to support a dedicated crew of people whose job is to do nothing else but do public relations. Why don’t national academies and organizations for the advancement of science have full-time, professional communicators? The only organization that I can think of that is even close to the sort of “think tank” person who seems to be so routinely called for media interviews is the National Center for Science Education . They do a heroic job, but there’s only sixteen people listed on staff, including some whose job is in no way related to science. Allocation of resources is a major problem, and time is a 100% non-renewable resource. People who can devote time to that will, in the short term, win. The good news may be that because scientists are responsible for generating new knowledge, that can help in the long term. Ultimately, denialists cannot create anything new. Image from here .

David Crotty at The Scholarly Kitchen examines a wonky paper on science blogging , and asks, “If you knew people read your blog, would you blog differently?” (I’m paraphrasing there...) Jeff Jarvis at BuzzMachine asks, “ In the Google age, what is the point of teaching memorization? ” An excellent question, and one I also struggle with. Sheril Kirshenbaum asks at The Intersection what readers want to know about energy . I’m perpetually confused by nuclear power generation and whether it’s worth it or not. Armin Schneider, in a book review in PLoS Biology , says neuroscientists must not be interested in the history of their field, because the aren’t a lot of people in the history poster sessions. He neglects to mention that the history posters are displayed all week long, while regular posters are only up for four hours. Visits to the history posters are going to be more spread out. Nancy Duarte wanted feedback on the cover for her next book . It’ll be called Resonate , and I guarantee you I’ll be buying it whichever cover ends up on it. Yes, it’s about the Texas State Board of Education and the Texas K-12 education standards. Again. I’ve tried to limit my comments to stuff related to science, particularly biology, because that’s what I feel competent to make comments about. As a faculty member at a university that has about 85% Hispanic students, however, I feel obligated to highlight this bit from a New York Times article yesterday. It concerns the ongoing review of the state’s social studies standards. Efforts by Hispanic board members to include more Latino figures as role models for the state’s large Hispanic population were consistently defeated, prompting one member, Mary Helen Berlanga , to storm out of a meeting late Thursday night, saying, “They can just pretend this is a white America and Hispanics don’t exist.” Ms. Berlanga is the representative for the area that includes my institution, by the way. There’s much more of interest in the Times piece. Last equipment post for a while, but by no means least. Finally, something a little bit more high tech than forceps and a microscope . A 60 cycle noise eliminator, the HumBug . To understand how marvelous this little box is, I have to explain a little about electrophysiology. Everything you’re using to read this blog post runs off a powerline. So do lights and other electrical appliances. Those electric powerlines generate noise, or a “ hum ,” that cycles 60 times a second in North American, and 50 times a second in Australia and, I think, the U.K. This “60 cycle” is picked up by recording electrodes, like those used to record neural activity. Since biologists are interested in the biology and not power mains, the 60 cycle just gets in the way of seeing the actual biological signal. So eletrophysiologists have to spend huge amounts of time trying to eliminate that 60 cycle noise by grounding, using Faraday cages, tinfoil, alligator clamps, and offerings to minor deities. Worse, it’s incredibly unpredictable. A set-up that is perfect one day may have horrible 60 cycle the next day. Thus, anything that helps combat 60 cycle is a beautiful thing. And that is what this clever little device does. I had no idea it existed until I went to the annual Neuroscience meeting the year I was hired, and discovering it alone made the trip worthwhile. I had never met Carin Bondar until I followed her on Twitter . Only after that did I learn that we have several colleagues in common, so there is absolutely no “old boy’s club” networking behind her decision to put me in Nerd Corner this week. Nerd Corner? It’s like a regular corner, only, you know, nerdier. Actually, Carin thought I might be interesting enough to interview. I sure fooled her. Carin has a great website , with lots of other interviews, career resources, and more. Tell her Zen sent ya! P.S. – She’s not related to Canadian astronaut Roberta Bondar . Continuing this week with some of my favourite things in the lab... Like my first selection, this is something that is basic but absolutely fundamental. A good stereo dissecting microscope, with a mount for a camera. Edward Tufte often argues that much of science is the story of increasing resolving power. The classic example was the telescope, which was celebrated in the last year’s 400 th anniversary celebration of Galileo using the device for such great effect. Microscopes came slightly later, but also revolutionized thinking about the world. When I bought this microscope, I bought a camera lucida for drawing pictures, something I’d use through much of doctoral and post-doctoral work. A good drawing could provide more information more efficiently than using 35 mm film then. I have rarely used it, since digital photography had made it faster and more efficient to take a lot of photographs and work with those. Last month, I complained about the common misconception that tenure was “a job for life.” Florida State University has just provided an example of why it’s a misconception. Twenty-five examples, in fact. My sympathy to those losing their positions. The prospect of losing a job is always terrifying.
Whilst in search of the elusive snowdrops for tomorrow's challenge, I came across these crocuses in a churchyard.

On 5 September history was made by 7 Ministers of Health from low-income countries together with serious politicians from West Europe and representatives from aid organisations that had learnt their lessons . The group launched the International Health Partnership. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/ihp/default.asp If aid from rich countries should effectively improve health of the poor, they said, the aid must be: 1. coordinated, 2. foucsed on improving health systems as a whole instead of one disease at a time, 3. and part of good national plans. These statements are evidance based, much needed but "un-sexy". So let me translate the 3 statements into blunt words: 1. It is mad that Ministries of Health in low-income countries each week must meet a growing number of aid delegations. 2. It is cruel to tell millions of poor mothers; "your child is dying from pneumonia for which our clinic have no drugs because Bush, Blair and rich activits did not know that pneumonia and diarrhea kill as many as do malaria, TB and HIV. 3. It is stupid to fund seprate clinics for each disease when there is not even staff and money e nough for one clinic in each village. So, 5 September 2007, is a happy day for global health. Fragmented health aid based on what is "sexy" in the media of the rish will be replaced by health aid focusing on what is needed in the clinic of the poor. Why is Sweden not yet part of the International Health Partnership? The Swedish Minister for Development Aid recently wisely focused Swedish bilateral aid too fewer countries. So hopefully she will soon join the Partnership of the wise. In these issues it seems more important if politicians are wise than if they come from left or right, so we can hope that Sweden will join. This vlog uses a flash presentation that Gapminder did with Trendalyzer graphics. It shows the development of Sweden during the last 300 years. It is my first attempt to use chroma key video with animated statistics as done daily with weather forcasts in TV. Following my talk in Swedish radio news on how to avaoid child deaths in pneumonia I get requests on where to donate. What is needed is steady funding over many year so that poor families get access to diagnosis and antibiotics. I judge that UNICEF is most competent to provide long-term support for child survival. The reason is good track record, that the present Director Ann Veneman understands how health service system in low income countries need long term support and that UNICEF base their policy on best available research. To save children now donate to http://www.unicef.se/stod_oss/ge_en_gava_har/ if not in Sweden look up UNICEF in your country. To support research for better care for infections of the poor donate to World Infections Fund http://www.vif.se/mallar/donatewwallit.aspx?SidID=10186 . Keep donating regularly to a good cause, and learn about progress and challanges. The underfunded needs are the continious majora challanges for poor families; pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, education and the daily bread, i.e. agriculture in rula areas and job in urban areas. Water and sanitation also get less attention than emergency relief and HIV; the two worthy causes that presently receives almost sufficient funding. Cotton farmers in Texas earn their wealth from Soviet-like government subsidies. The annual 4 billion US dollar tax subsides to 25 000 US cotton farmers are of concern for global health! The reason being that this obstacle to free trade kill so many children. 1. Subsidies hamper economic growth in cotton producing west African countries. This keeps millions of hardworking farmers in poverty and hinder them to care well for their children. http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp30_cotton.htm 2. If only parts of the 4 tax billions were re-directed tovAnn Venneman at UNICEF, she can avoid 600,000 child deaths from pneumonia by using 0.6 billion USD to provide care and antibiotics. http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index_35937.html 3. The soviet cotton economy of Texas is a major obstacle for successful agreements on free world trade. And a fair global trade system will save thelives of so many children’s . http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl57_e.htm The world is waiting for a US president with the guts to implement a cotton Perestroika in Texas! On January 27 at the World Economic Forum in Davos I asked Bill Gates for help. Help to speed up provision of courses on Global Health at universities around the world. I gave him a copy of our Textbook on Global Health (see below). He rightly noted that it was the first of its kind and that fact based overviews of the global health situations are badly needed. On February 7 I got this note from our publisher Studentlitteratur: "Här kommer lite glada nyheter om Global Health. Dessutom har Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation köpt 200 ex som deras personal ska läsa!" Gates Foundation had bought 200 copies, one each for the staff! Is it possible to write a book on the health of all 6.5 billion persons living on the globe? Well we did it and now it is on sale from Monday 27/11 2006. We are six authors, but it was Ann Lindstrand who got it together and Birgitta Rubensson that brought it to print. Hundreds of students read and commented various versions. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b/203-2244500-9311121?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=rosling We wrote it for those that in a short text want to learn: -how the health of the world's population has changed over time; -how the main determinants of health varied with time and place; -how health can be measured; about the causes of the main diseases in the world; -what health care that exist around the world. Our book is a summary of the works by greater scholars on global health. The pros with our book are the overviews; the cons are the simplifications and errors that are a consequence of our broad ambitions. Yesterday UNAIDS declared: " the global AIDS epidemic continuous to grow... an estimated 40 millions are living with HIV... the number with HIV has increased from 37 millions in 2004. www.unaids.org But on the AIDS day in 2004 the message from UNAIDS was that "over 41 million people are living with HIV/AIDS" http://www.un.org/events/aids/2004/ Are UNAIDS lying? No, it is led by honest and good scientists, so how come? If you dig further into the data you find that the uncertainty range of UNAIDS estimates are wide: - somewhere between 32 to 44 millions lived with HIV in 2004 and today somewhere between 34 to 47 millions. So the true number may be slowly falling. A reasonable conclusion is that the number of HIV infected in the world remains the same over the last years. But telling that may put funding for much needed HIV/AIDS control at risk, so its better to conclude that the epidemic continuous to grow. UNAIDS may be excused for drawing the scary conclusion that the epidemic is still increasing, because they simultaneously communicate that there are solid evidence that the epidemic is decreasing in more and more countries. The exclusive focus on treatment may have delayed the decrease. Best available assessment indicate that money is best used on scaling up prevention http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5766/1474 But international support to prevention tends to focus on the moral of the donor rather than the effectiveness of the action. The present US administration likes to fund "less sex" and Sweden likes to fund "more condoms". Evidence from Zimbabwe tells that both works. Later sex debut and fewer partners may even be more important than more condom use http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5761/664
I just read this very interesting point/counterpoint piece over on the website of the American Academy of Family Physicians. As you may or may not know, I am a proud Family Medicine Physician. And, yes, I am (still) a dues paying member of the AAFP. I owe a lot to the Academy including introduction to organizational medicine as well as leadership training as a medical student, family medicine resident, and now. The post I read was in their letter to the editor section and it was called "AAFP Is 'Pawn' In Health Care Reform; Academy Says 'Not So' . The first letter is from former AAFP president Michael Fleming, MD. I first met Dr. Fleming when I was a medical student and I have always respected his opinion - especially on policy issues. Here's what he says: As someone who has been involved with advocacy for many years, I'm writing to express my brutal disappointment in the AAFP's positioning and effectiveness in the recent health care debate. Although family physicians are in critical need of advocacy for their issues -- payment reform, a repeal and permanent fix for the sustainable growth rate, liability reform, recognition of the value of family medicine, graduate medical education reform, etc. -- the AAFP seems to have become more enamored of photo opportunities at the White House than the needs of members. In my opinion, the AAFP has been used by most of Washington as a pawn in a $2 trillion chess game -- and the pawn can never win. The AAFP could have taken the high road of quality care for patients and fair payment for the most valuable health care providers. Instead, the organization has gone "all in" for one highly partisan bill that will have absolutely no effect on the issues I listed above. The organization and its leaders need to take a close look at themselves and be reminded of the reason the AAFP actually exists: to meet the needs of its dues-paying members. The counterpoint to this letter is from current AAFP President Lori Heim, MD. This is also someone I have known for a long time and whose opinion I have always respected. The AAFP Board, to their credit, whether you agree with them or not, has been clear in their position. Here's what she said: I appreciate Dr. Fleming's point of view. But when it comes to health care reform, we have to remain true to the path the AAFP Congress of Delegates approved. We must hold on to the AAFP’s long-standing principles of health care for all, a system founded on appropriately paid primary medical care, and a replenished pipeline of family physicians. Although not the end game, the health care legislation currently in Congress takes important steps in that direction. It expands coverage to more than 30 million Americans. With its 10 percent Medicare bonus for primary care physicians and pilot testing of the patient-centered primary care medical home, it embarks on reshaping our health delivery system based on primary medical care. And it invests in primary care training by expanding scholarships and student loan forgiveness programs for medical students entering primary care. Certainly, the legislation misses the mark in some areas. But the AAFP's work in shaping health care reform has put family medicine in good stead for future legislation that will address, for example, the flawed sustainable growth rate formula and potential reform to the medical liability system. Far from being a pawn, the AAFP has been able to shape the legislation, which shows the first recognition of the value of primary care. Nothing is perfect. But we must make a start. The best start we've had in 16 years is the legislation now before Congress. Now, before you predict some kind of wishy-washy "on the fence" opinion post from me, this may surprise you. It's no secret that I am disenchanted with organized medicine these days - whether it be AAFP or the AMA - or whatever. I wrote about it in October 2009 . I think a lot of physician organizations are having debates like this one. What do I think? Well, in my book, tort reform (ie - liability reform) and having a fix to the flawed sustainable growth rate are important to me and, I think, important to a lot of dues paying members of physician organizations - not to mention the potential negative impact the proposed legislation would have to physician small business owners (those who have not been swallowed up yet by corporate health care systems - or those physicians who already work for government agencies). Whatever finally happens, if anything happens with this legislation, I believe that these national physician membership organizations will have used a lot of political capital that will be very difficult to get back. In my opinion, it has already been kind of showing itself in a decreasing number of practicing physicians joining professional organizations, and even some leaving these professional membership organizations. In other instances, state chapters are distancing themselves from their national organizations. For example, the Ohio State Medical Association (which is the state chapter of the American Medical Association), has all but come out against the current AMA position on the known health care reform drafts. When it is all said and done, will it have been worth it for these national organizations? Well see....

Well, I'm attending my first HIMMS conference (which stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems ) annual meeting. These are the 37 best posts that the medical blogosphere has to offer this week. In my editors picks, I wanted to highlight what I think are well-written stories. There is also a short excerpt from each of my picks this week. Also, I invite you to check out coverage of this week's HIMSS conference which include Better Health's live streaming interviews today and tomorrow (see the video feed and chat room at the bottom of this post). I will also be hosting a HIMSS wrap-up show with Dr. Val Jones on Wednesday, March 3rd at 8pm Eastern Time for The Doctor Anonymous Show 150 which is my live, interactive internet radio show. Now, on to Grand Rounds! Dr. A's Picks Of The Week Captain Atopic , a medical student in Australia, sees so much emotion in people's eyes . Sitting in the corner of the meeting room, an off-call consultant's eyelids fall. The night registrar talks animatedly and the day team joke. The consultant's patients have been discussed and his coffee hasn't kicked in. The bounce of his chin rouses him. The round passes through a medical ward; eyes look up, eyes dart around. The octogenerian's glassed, cloudy eyes search for focus, and find wanting. The narc'd lady next door sleeps soundly, eyes rolling in an opiate fog. Bruce Campbell , a physician from the United States, learns that physicians and nurses have a lot to share even when we believe we do not. The patient arrived at the rural clinic near Guazapa, El Salvador, in his mother’s arms with a mouth gag tied in place and his hands wrapped in bandages. As his mother put him gently onto the examination table, his muscles twitched hard, tearing the paper bed cover and forcing the gag out of his mouth. “Be calm,” his mother whispered to him in Spanish. He remained contorted but visibly quieted as our pediatrician, Dr. Mike, held him. Kerri Sparling , diabetes blogger extraordinaire, shares another side of future mommyhood. I love BSparl. I love her little feet and her pouty lips and that feeling I get when she rolls around inside of me. I love knowing that my daughter is just a few weeks away from becoming a part of our Sparling family, and I know that every moment of this pregnancy is completely worth every iota of effort and worry. That being said.... I'm starting to lose my mind a bit. That being said ... I'm starting to lose my mind a little bit. Bongi , a physician from South Africa, learned early in medical school that consultants only stick to their field . we walked into the tea room where the consultants were hard at work drinking tea and introduced ourselves. the designated tutorial giver groaned audibly. he then glanced over at his colleagues and rolled his eyes. they chuckled. funnily enough i think they thought they were being subtle. after all we were mere medical students and therefore couldn't easily pick up on the finer points of non-verbal communication like specialist psychiatrists could. i was immediately annoyed, but i chose to hide it.

(Click for Closeup) To launch the online magazine Ekleksographia Wave Two: William Blake and the Mad Tea Party (edited by Philip Davenport), the artist Sarah Sanders performed an online writing event "for 24 hours from sunrise on Monday 15th March through to the following sunrise on Tuesday 16th March 2010." On her website, she wrote that "This is a one off event and no documentation will be made." Actually, that's not quite true. I left the live video stream going for about an hour while I caught up on some online reading tonight, and I snapped a few screenshots of her writing in action. For the most part, nothing happened. Sanders was nearing the end of a twenty-four hour marathon, and she must of been tired, so all I could see was a slight moundlike bit of paper, maybe a loose sheet, maybe bound into a book. I could tell that pencil marks had been made on it in lines, but little else. The wall behind it looked like the sky, so the still picture I saw seemed a landscape, of words. Occasionally, though, Sanders would appear on screen and begin some frantic scribbling onto that sheet of paper with a nub of a pencil. She was (and actually is) writing a sentences or sentences. Syntax is flowing through her words, and I've enjoyed watching her write, watching the physical act of writing. And I'm happy to document this in this quite modest way, to remember a day of writing. Just now, just before midnight (Eastern Daylight Savings Time), I watched her closely enough to read a short string of words. This is difficult to do because the camera is frozen in a closeup of the page when she writes, and she moves the paper violently back and force when she does. But I saw her write this string of words: "long till sunrise." She wonders, it seems, how long it is till sunrise, and she longs for it, because at sunrise she can sleep. She has about an hour and a half to go by my figuring. Sleep well, Sarah. ecr. l'inf. See a seen. A shape inviolate of wonder often has possi bilities unthought.

I had almost forgotten that today was Pi Day, so I had almost forgotten to write my piem. If I had, I would have been asleep before midnight tonight, because I am just back from a trip to Purchase, New York, where Nancy and I saw our son Tim and a play he’s been working on. The trip down there was complicated by hundreds of downed trees. It took us an extra hour to find a way to make it the last four minutes to campus. We were impressed by the destruction: huge trees pushed onto their sides by high winds, power lines over us slouching downward under the weight of trees leaning into them, and leaning trees pulling themselves out of the earth. A day after the storm, many roads remained unpassable. So I would not have minded not having a poem to work on once we made it home late tonight. But I had a poem to write, so I did. ecr. l’inf. Alan Halsey, from Ship of Fools What we write with are our minds, but what we write with are our hands.

The new issue of Ekleksographia online magazine ‘William Blake and the Naked Teaparty’ guest edited by Philip Davenport features textworks that emphasise the touch - handwrit and haptic – particularly pieces that consider emotional engagements, human space - that weird trace and corporate/military erasure of the handmade, the human touch, the not-digital. These qualities link into the alternative tradition of poetics - and to 'outsider' artists who are owed a debt by the experimenters (an IOU all the way back to Will Blake, he and the Mrs sitting on the lawn in London afternoons, naked, drinking tea).

My copy of the book was born on the 18th of January of this year in Charleston, South Carolina, and I find it somehow soothing that I know exactly when it was born and that I've read it this year. The book is Elizabeth Bryant's (nevertheless enjoyment , which is an opening that is eventually closed. But during the course of it—which, if anything, is too short—the book works its way through the bittersweet music of living a life, without devolving into something maudlin or untrue. The book is of a piece, a set of short prose poems that think through what a live might be or is. I know Elizabeth, so I have to note that I may have some bias in her favor. After a poetry reading last night, Nancy and I went out to dinner at the only Mexican restaurant in Tivoli, New York, with Elizabeth and Anne Gorrick, Lynn Behrendt, and Reb Livingston. But my response to her poetry is not so much about her as about her words. Even last night, speaking on a different subject, I noted that my interest wasn't in poets per se (except as purveyors of words), but in poems. (nevertheless enjoyment is a book of tiny prose poems that almost resemble the story of a woman's life, except that they represent, instead, merely brief moments and considerations in such a life. They hold together because of the tone of the language, their focus on the personal aspects of life (over the professional or even the poetic), and the feel of them. These are not necessarily sad poems, but they are restrained in their emotion. These are flashing fragments of stories that are occasionally somber yet always tinged with a sense or reality, something strangely missing from most poems I read these days. It seems to me that the best review I can ever provide is to list the lines and phrases that I find startling in a poem, but that is actually inadequate. It eviscerates the poems in any book, but it's particularly problematic with this one. Elizabeth builds her poems through the accumulation of phrases. She doesn't write so much in sentences as in phrases, in wholes that might seem to be fragments of a thought. But this is the source of her poems' rhetorical power. These concatenated phrases sometimes propel the putative narrative forward and sometimes send it off course, set it askew, ask the reader to understand the inevitable surprise of life. For these are living poems about living life. Geof Huth Reads Selections from Elizabeth Bryant's (nevertheless enjoyment To understand these poems, and to hear them, I actually taped a few of them, trying to learn to speak in their serious and languid manner. As I did, I sometimes heard the failing of my inner ear to hear the rhythm and syntax of these poems, but also to hear their delicate beauty. For these are not showy poems at all. The language is simple, the syntax is straightforward, and it is the rhetoric of the poems that propels them forward. The poems make arguments about relationships, perception, living, and it is that sense of needing to speak out a life (though done almost totally drained of emotion) is what moves these poems forward. And one of the rhetorical tricks of these poems is to stop a poem in its tracks, to insert a phrase that makes us rethink the entire enterprise. I can't adequately express the beauty of these poems, not even by speaking them aloud to you, so let me add two more notes about these poems. First, each has a title that ends with a closing parenthesis even though it does not begin with and opening one. What this simple act of titling tells us is that the opening of the title of each poem is actually the title of the book itself, so the short poem "of a head smacked in afterthought)" is actually the end of a title that begins "(nevertheless enjoyment." This tells us a story, one possibly about loss, one about imperfection, about life. We are told that things might go wrong, but that still there is enjoyment in life, that our lives our guided by our ability to see that enjoyment. Second, this is a visual book in one almost subtle way. This is actually a flipbook. Because, as we read through the book, each subsequent poem is a step lower than the others on the page. The poem is a movement downwards, in terms of feeling. But in terms of poetry, this is a work of restrained beauty and depth. Just the book we need. _____ Bryant, Elizabeth. (nevertheless enjoyment . Quale Press: np, 2010. ecr. l'inf At work this week, a single line in a single document four of us were working on transformed into a minor controversy that raged for a couple of days and pushed the completion of that tiny project off for just as long. Afterwards, the person who had asked the question that set off this asked me how something so small could have such a great effect. My answer, as it always is, is that the smallest things matter most. For that reason, I'm glad that endwar has a new chapbook out from Naissance at chapbookpublisher.com . endwar is a hyperminimalist poet, someone interested in the hugeness of the tiniest effects, someone interested in purity and the way in which language can be completely turned on its head by the movement of a single letter. These are poems for the hyperliterate as well, poems for people with a deep interest in the word and the word especially as a field of action for thought. (I do need to admit that I've "published" a few of these poems before both on this blog and via my tiny little micropress, dbqp, so my interest in this book and these poems is, in some way personal. And the personal continues, because a number of these poems closely resemble or are exactly identical to poems I've written, including a few poems in my recent book ntst . But these are only a few poems, because endwar's imagination is a bit different from mine, and it is in those poems, the ones I never could have imagined into existence myself, that I see his best work.) One of the best poems in this book, one reproduced on the publisher's website, and one uncharacteristically romantic is ( my hand remembers the shape of your hand ) Working with the visual pun of the parenthesis as a hand, because he always works with the pun, endwar writes what seems to me one of the greatest love poems (if such a thing is possible) I've ever read, something delicate, human, and quietly beautiful, and something restrained, not a cry of joy or melancholy, merely a statement, bolstered by emotion that is hidden yet still real. Many of these poems are great little pwoermds, instances of insight that come and go but that continue to resonate: everyhere eare rhthmh Very few pwoermdists have this level of control, such surprising control of the DNA of written language, this ability to produce meaning by the addition, subtraction, or repetition of a single language, but this is the way that endwar words, and carefully. He doesn't produce huge quantities of these tiny poems of his, but those he does are almost all surprisingly fresh and satisfying. A few of his poems are only a few words long a[tom b]bomb some are based on naming the punctuation marks the thorn , and none are more than a dozen words long, because endwar is not a narrator, not a storyteller. He is a creator of instants designed to awaken our minds and to make us see the world of words before us. Without poets like endwar to show us the surprises of language that sit constantly before us, that language would be invisible to us, something that exists, that we might even use well, but something we would never see for itself. endwar deconstructs our entire system of written communication, and he does it by moving language around carefully, as a scientist might use a pipette to move the tiniest bit of animal matter to another spot on the same petri dish in order to see what changes would result. _____ endwar. Open your I . Naissance: np, 2009. US$10. ecr. l'inf. I watched twenty-two movies tonight, though (admittedly) at least one of them was under a minute long, and Stan Brakhage is certainly a poet with film, or was, and a couple of his films are clearly filmpoems. There is a reason that his brand of filmmaking was occasionally called the poetic cinema. His films are beautiful, personal, revelatory, and sometimes the smallest of them—certainly Moth Light , even the almost instantaneous Eye Myth —can shake you awake. Tonight was a night that left little time for poetry, but what there was I took. I sat down on my couch with Volume I of The Collected Poems of Larry Eigner , and I read a few dozen more pages into it. I’m going slowly, but I’m enjoying the instants of pleasure in his early work, where he’s trying to hone his craft, and sometimes only succeeding in writing a startling phrase, a perfect instant. It is always the instants that matter, the smallest bits of perceptible experience that matter. So I might wonder why I don’t worry much about margins. Beneath my posting last night about Larry Eigner’s Collected Poems , John Bloomberg-Rissman asked me, Did you see Steven Fama's post about this set? He's got serious problems with the way the edition’s laid out; he thinks it puts the lie to the editors' claims of fidelity. I believe 23 comments follow, some from Curtis F, one of the editors. I wonder what you think of all this, from the visual poet's point of view? Originally, I had begun to comment back to John, but my comment became too long to be a comment, so I’ve worked it into this: I read that posting, but not until today. I was a couple of entries behind on Steven Fama’s blog, which I have to say is always interesting, passionate, and full of good information. In the blog entry in question , Steven argues that the editors of Eigner’s collected (Curtis Faville and Robert Grenier) ruined Eigner’s poems by printing them flush left instead of a few inches to the right of the margin, as Eigner often did in his typescripts. He argued that Eigner meant for the poems to be floating in white space and to do something else, as they had, ruined the integrity of the poems. I have to say Steven is certainly correct, to a degree. I think most of the poems would look bett
r floating in white space. And we could argue that that was Eigner's intention. Most of the time. But I’d say Steven has exaggerated the issue. I had already scanned through the book by the time I'd read this, so I'd determined that no other good solution was possible. In Eigner's later poems, especially, he tended to use more and more of the page, making the affordance of a three-inch left margin impossible if you wanted to maintain the textual interrelations of text within the poems themselves. For examples, see “starry figures,” IV:1598; “was will be,” IV:1612, and, most obviously, “there’s a season,” IV:1684-1685. With a three-inch margin on the left, these poems would be off the page or reformatted out of existence. These examples are not numerous, but they show that Eigner had to drastically narrow the left-hand margin in some cases just to accommodate the poems, which argues that the wide left margin was not an essential characteristic of the poems but a convenience considering the general narrowness of his poems. (For instance, I tend to center individual poems of my own on a page, but if I lay them out into a book, I move them to some left-hand margin I define.) To me the left margin has no particular essence to it, because the essence is within the atomized cloud of words. The page is just the holder. Most of Eigner’s poems are not what I’d call visual poems, but they nearly are. They are what I call visualized poems, poems with a significant and important visual presence, but ones still focused on words over text. One solution to allow for three-inch-or-better margins would be to reduce the type size, but the type is already small enough. And their size replicates the size of Eigner’s own type, allowing for a sense of how he put his word clouds together. (My argument, stretching this metaphor a bit, is that a beautiful cloud is itself, separably beautiful. It is not beautiful necessarily because of its placement in the sky.) Another solution would be to start poems at different distances from the left-hand margin, which would be unsightly, a typographical mess. I’ve done this myself before, and it leads to visual chaos that doesn’t seem useful to me. So the only other solution I can think of would be to go to a landscape oriented page, which had nothing to do with how Larry operated and which would require cutting individual poems across two pages, thus ruining the intentional mise en page of his usually one page or shorter poems. The decisions Curtis Faville and Bob Grenier made in this book seem to me to be the right ones. The decision about where to begin the poems is, simply, the only one. So, sure, the poems go pretty deep into the crevice of the left-hand margin, but this problem is obviated to some degree by the fact of the almost-constantly available white space on the facing verso page, which still gives the illusion of the poems floating in space. Not as much, not as well, but as well as could be expected. What's most important in an Eigner poem, typographically, is not the left-hand margin; it is the interrelations of the words in the typographic gridspace, and this is what these volumes maintain, going so far as to preserve every instance of double spaces between two words, though I remain unsure that these are always intentional and meaningful typographic instants. Also, as the book itself demonstrates through reproductions of typescripts, Eigner often squeezed multiple poems onto a page in a reasonably messy way. (See the cover of volume IV.) Is this, then, meant to be an instruction to future editors to crowd those poems onto the page? I think not. And Faville and Grenier, in this instance, have pushed the fourth poem, reasonably, I'd say, onto the next page. If you look at Eigner’s typescripts, you can see that most are messes of one kind or another, to one degree or another. They are workspaces. They are the workshop in which he created his poems, though not the poems themselves. The poems do not require the scribbled notations of Eigner’s, the stuffing of extra poems onto the page, or even the common but not constant wide left-hand margins. Even though I love those myself. I find it interesting that Fama presents a reproduction of the final page of the book From the Sustaining Air as an example of how to do things. I'd say it is not. First, the poem really has no title besides its first line. That heavy title hanging over the poem (and essentially segregated from the poem because it is flush left while the poem is center-right), is awkward, unnecessary, and improperly capitalized. And the adherence to the extra-wide margin merely throws the poem awkwardly off-center on this narrower-than-letter-size page. This is all wrong, and this is early in Eigner's career, before his visual effects became more fluid, and more essential. This is a pre-visualized poem, one of those that preceded Eigner's real greatness (though this is a stunningly great poem and one of my favorites—maybe the title of my blog posting from last night gives that away. I wonder if the final versions of the poems developed by Grenier and Eigner together (their names, I'll note again, are almost anagrammatic, as if they were almost the same person) actually complied constantly to this three-inch-or-fatter margin. I doubt so, since it's just not possible for all the poems. But Grenier could tell us. And Grenier lived with Eigner for quite a few years, so it’s likely he understood Eigner better than those of us who know him only as words on a page. I've just started reading this book. It is four large volumes long, and I have much more to read, and I'm reading the entirety of the book in sequential order, so I'll pause occasionally through this experiment to record a few thoughts here, about the poems, about their development, about their visual effects, and about Eigner as a visual or nearly-visual poet, of the first order. ecr. l’inf. Every book, it now seems to me, is completely inconceivable to us until it lay in our hands. I have tried to use pictures to understand what the monstrous publishing project The Collected Poems of Larry Eigner really is, but they led me astray. The picture available anywhere shows the front cover, but only of the first volume of four—and each volume is illustrated with a different image, except that each image is of the same typescript of a single poem of Eigner's. For the covers are the frames of a movie that moves in slow motion, as slowly as our eyes cross over the covers, as slowly as they recognize the repetition. The first frame is illustrated by two exploded words, two lines of text, "calligraphy/typewriters." If we know Eigner, we know of his severe palsy, how he typed his poems for decades with one finger and one thumb with a typewriter, and we know that the typewriter is his way of writing. If we know Eigner, we know that he worked his poems, slowly, methodically, across the field of the page, and we know that his poems were all about the mise en page, so we might guess how his determined typing was the only calligraphy he could have, that the machine itself and the invisible gridspace it worked upon were the fingers of his calligrapher's hand. The second frame pulls back—each frame pulls back a bit more from the last—to reveal what seems to be the opening of a poem, one of these telegraphic diagonals via which Eigner learned to communicate. We begin with writing ("calligraphy/typewriters"), then move into an image of his hat (I pause here to announce, as I always do, that "Huth" means "hat"), which is followed quickly by a "bureau" encased in parentheses. His hat, maybe, is within his bureau. And that is where, and in his writing ("calligraphy/typewriters") is where, and in his head (thus under his hat) is where "the world/inside/spins." When we pull back far enough to see the third frame, we see that this poem that we may have imagined continuing beyond "spins" has come to a stop, that that was the entire poem, something about writing and imagination, something about the life of the mind, maybe particularly the life of an agile man inside a crippled body, something possibly hopeful, even if a little disorienting. But we also see clearly now a little bit more. We see Eigner's calligraphy. We see his crooked hand scrawling its way into and then out of a circle. We see that this is poem number 1117 and that it's from "Jan 3 [19]79," that the poem would be published in Orogrande , that Eigner thought, in three lines of type, that the "First 2 lines might be / a good title for a Col / lected Poems." By the time we arrive at the fourth frame, we see the entire page with the poem, and we see that the poem we have been looking at is in the middle of the page, and that it is only one of four poems on that sheet. Eigner's handwriting, which seems now relatively neat, heads every poem, providing the metadata we need to understand the poem: the poet's name, the date of composition, the sequential number, and the dotted lines that separate one poem deliberately from another. So I saw the covers and began reading this book of four books. It opens with the expected introductory matter, which shows Robert Grenier as someone attuned to both the look and the sound of Eigner's poetry and a person writing only for himself, a purified poet writing introductions in a sometimes schematic way, in bursts of prose, set off by dashes and commas and parentheses, which, in the end, at least for me, communicates his excitement with the work. And the work begins early in Eigner's career, with his juvenilia, starting when he was nine. The earliest poems show skill better than a nine-year-old should have but we have to read for years until Eigner slowly begins to turn into himself. It's a beautiful process, like an unfolding, to watch how rectangles of text open up, poem by poem, year by year, until their words are freed to roam the page and make their sense as they will. I'm only on page 57 right now, but I'll continue to write about this book, from time to time, all the way through to co-editor Curtis Faville's essay at the end of the book, all the way to the index by Amy Grenier. This is a large reading project, but an essential one for me. Early on, when I was barely a teenager, if that, Eigner was important to me, the poet I couldn't escape. Now, so many years in the future, I cannot even remember where or how I found Eigner, or what of his I read, but I was already a visual poet, so already interested as words as physical objects on a page, so Eigner was my poet, but he was also a poet, as these poems so clearly show. For many years, I didn't think of Eigner, and I don't know how this happened, how I let him slip away, how I found in my library of thousands of books not a single book of Eigner's, until a couple of years ago. But I'm returning home. We always do it, if only in our minds, because we cannot escape our origins. I'm not quite there, but in thirty pages I'll be to one of his famous poems, one that titled a book of his, "from the sustaining air," which is not that visual, but which has a beautiful sense of movement through the sense and sensing of the poem, and which ends with a line that really does seem to echo James Wright, but which reverberates with its own throaty call: "I am, finally, an incompetent, after all" And thus we understand our hapless flailings in this world, and something of the beauty of them, the beauty of merely trying. _____ Eigner, Larry.

I wrote quite a few thousand words tonight, but all via email and to friends, so I'm left with the idea of not writing a full posting tonight. I also spent part of the night putting a recent tiny publication of mine into small envelopes that I'd be sending out to 30 of my closest friends (many of whom I've never met). So I have decided to combine these two parts of my night into one, and announce the release of my leaflet "nfoldings" from pdqb (one of my many nanopresses). "nfoldings" is a small leaflet five pages in length, and it presents five of my visual poems, the first five poems of my "Waxwords" sequence. I find it a reasonably successful publication. Well enough designed and with a reasonably eclectic collection of five similarly created asemic poems. It is possible that my favorite of my own poems are those that are entirely wordless. ecr. l'inf.

It's rather stunning that anyone thought this was a good idea. via techdirt.com I have a webcam built-in to my laptop. I can't remove it. Maybe I need a piece of tape, or a band-aid, or something.

Giving a talk at the University of Utah on everything from scaling, clustering, mysql, mysql internals, noSQL (Cassandra) to how to manage all this stuff. If you are there at University I'm bringing some Swag! Also I will upload the slides and put them here. Brian Aker , a brilliant helpful duder, who I learn a lot from. Gives a great talk about what is NoSQL explained in a way for database guys. I warn you, there are some points in this video where you can't hear Brian due to the audience "participation" but you should get the content. INNODB has some irritating gotchas that makes disk space management hard. In 2002ish INNODB, added innodb_file_per_table to get around allot of these issues, but it does not fix everything. If you are running innodb_file_per_table, you will notice in your database directory db.opt - database characteristics file. tablename.frm - the table structure. tablename.ibd - the actual innodb table space file Imagine that you have a table with 10 million rows and you delete say 5 million rows in multiple chunks around 400K chunks, because deletes are slow. Next, you notice that the table space file did not shrink. So what do you do? OPTIMIZE tablename, tada all the wasted space is reclaimed, but here is the PROBLEM the ibdata file grew! ibdata stores all of the UNDO LOGS thus GROWS due to the deletes and space is never reclaimed. Ok, lets try coping the tablespace file to another directory and re-import the tablespace file after wiping the data dictionary (ibdata). For instance /etc/init.d/mysql stop cd /var/lib/mysql/DB cp - /tmp/hold rm /var/lib/mysql/ib- cp /tmp/hold/- /var/lib/mysql/DB /etc/init.d/mysql start // create the ibdata file ALTER TABLE tablename IMPORT TABLESPACE ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'DB.tablename' does not exist Really, there is nothing that you can do to force innodb to purge the undo logs in the ibdata file without a full dump of the data to text and then reimport the data. So here are the steps to shrink all table spaces and the ibdata file mysqldump --all-databases (or use mk-parallel-dump) stop mysql rm -f /var/lib/mysql/ib- /var/lib/mysql/DB/- start mysql mysqlimport (or use mk-parallel-restore) Takes a bunch of time but there is no other recourse. If you know of another way please share :) I'll be giving a web presentation Jan. 19th 2010. If you would like to check it out please do! Scaling to 200K Transactions per Second with Open Source - MySQL, Java, curl, PHP I thought it went well. I will post the link to the slides here :) Scaling to 200K Transactions per Second with Open Source - MySQL, Java, curl, PHP In a procedural language without the use of threads (or Inter Process Communication via forks), to execute I/O requests they are done one after another. Synchronous Queries produce at best a Big-O of N such that N is an element of I/O communication (queries) and N equals the number of queries needed to achieve the requested dataset. With IPC or threads we can speed up common O(N) problems to reduce the N with parallelism, its still functionally a O(N) yet from a single instance point of view N is much less because threads (IPC) takes that Serial computing component and executes the code in parallel. To better explain what I am talking about lets look at some PHP code: foreach($friends as $friend){ $data[] = getMySQLData(“SELECT - FROM AccountData WHERE userid = $friend); } The Primary key for the AccountData table is userid. Assuming that you have 5000 friends, the query has to be executed 5000 times. We can reduce the O(N) and change it to a O(nlogn) (Binary Tree - doesn't take into account other factors) by switching the query to $data = getMYSQLData(“SELECT - FROM AccountData WHERE userid IN (….)”); We just sped up the retrieval of the data significantly, yet we just introduced a bottle neck on the datalayer. Our architecture requires that the data is located in a single location. What if AccountData’s data is spread across many servers federated by userid? This means that userid belongs to a server, so the server contains a shard of the AccountData’s Data. Now we are back to a O(N) where each query needs to be executed on the corresponding shard. The logical next step is to group queries per shard and run across them all. For instance $multiShardIDs = $genericShard->getMultipleShardIDs($objIds); foreach ($multiShardIDs as $shardID => $shardUserIDs) { if (stripos($orgQuery, " WHERE ") !== false){ $query = $orgQuery." AND {$column} IN (".implode(',', $shardUserIDs).") "; } else{ $query = $orgQuery." WHERE {$column} IN (".implode(',', $shardUserIDs).") "; } $shard_to_sql[$shardID] = $query; .... more stuff .... Yet this is still a O(N) its just that N is smaller. Each query is still executed serially. Let’s look at some stats of synchronous queries of SELECT 1; This query is executed across 35 shards and the timings are from PHP point of view. Field End Value Start Value Delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9872 9865 7 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 11344 11114 230 ru_nivcsw 977 968 9 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 865054 849053 16001 ru_utime.tv_sec 16 16 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 556097 552097 4000 ru_stime.tv_sec 1 1 0 Total Execution Time 0.18323707580566 As you can see, to execute this from PHP it took 100 ms, 100s pages reclaimed and 200s voluntary context switches to query 35 servers. Now let’s look at Asynchronous execution of SELECT 1; // the query generation is from PHP yet the execution is performed on a server that executes the query in parallel Field End Value Start Value Delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9131 9121 10 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 3891 3889 2 ru_nivcsw 290 290 0 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 596287 596287 0 ru_utime.tv_sec 4 4 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 460028 460028 0 ru_stime.tv_sec 0 0 0 Total Execution Time 0.019363880157471 As you can see from the table above executing the query asynchronously produced results with less context switching, less pages reclaimed and almost 10 times execution improvement over the synchronous query counterpart. How is the asynchronous query executed? Lets take a look at the figure below. So A user comes through the firewall / load balancer with a HTTP Request to the www pool that runs PHP. PHP now makes a CURL request to the Async Shard Servers (through a LB same LB different PORT). The HTTP Request to the Async Shard Server contains the SQL we wish to execute. The Async Shard Servers has a thread per shard and executes the request in parallel. The results are merged and sent to the calling CURL process via JSON. The returned JSON is then converted into a PHP object. This is a typical three-tier environment. When having to query multiple servers using an Asynchronous Tier is dramatically faster; in fact its as fast as the slowest server. This is the main sticking point of why asynchronous queries are faster then synchronous queries (in this context) since the total execution time for serial queries is the SUM of all the query execution. The current version of the server is used for Friend Query execution across the datalayer. Its been solid for a few months now, and I'm currently getting permission to release it as an Open Source Product. The features this server contains: Lightweight CPU bounded Scales Linearly A Timer Thread to keep the database config up to date in memory and fetching the config from PHP so if PHP changes connections to the shards so does Java Uses Java-6 Executor Service Merges the result set prior to sending it to the calling process Communicates via JSON Uses MySQL Connector/J Supports a high concurrency Optimized thread usage If I have run into a mySQL bug, I look to see if that bug is fixed by searching the mySQL bug database. If I've notice a performance bottleneck, I look to see if the performance bottleneck has been fixed by searching the same database. I will NOT upgrade to the latest and greatest version of mySQL (5.4) I stay within my branch (5.0). These are my three general motivations that drive my upgrade decisions. Anytime I upgrade I also make a list of things that might affect my environment for the stuff I use. Here are my steps: Check the change log Ignore all the NDB changes... I don't use it and that's the majority of fixes. This is also, why I do not use it. List the changes that will affect the production environment Deploy the version that I picked on a few servers running my original config Do data corruption tests (make sure my checksum scripts return the same data) Verify that the problem I'm trying to fix is fixed Deploy to more boxes Let the new server bake for a period of no less than a week Deploy everyplace So now, I'm upgrading from 5.0.56 to 5.0.86. What I'm trying to fix is mysql memory overhead at high levels of ram. For instance, I have a slew of 48GB boxes. I set the bufferpool to 40GB; the OS uses 1 GB of memory (roughly) leaving an overhead of 7GB for the system cache and various spikes of sort buffers. Over a period, I see that mySQL will consume and hold onto 47GB of memory for an unknown reason even with some tight my.cnf settings. (I'm certain they are tight since I know what each buffer does). Therefore, testing some later versions of mySQL we found that these later versions do not grow past the settings defined yet performs the same. Next, since I decided that upgrading is a good solution, now it’s time to list all the changes that fixes things. 5.0.58 - INNODB performance fix 5.0.60 - various problems that I should be affected by but havn't noticed so it’s fair to assume that said problems were introduced after my build. 5.0.62 - nothing major noticed the sp releases that's why I wait. 5.0.64 - nothing major 5.0.66 - security fixes and fixes to fix the bugs introduced from this build. 5.0.67 - two INNODB performance fixes and crash bug fixes. 5.0.68 - changes show status and fixes an innodb crash bug. 5.0.70 - fix another INNODB crash bug and security fixes 5.0.72 - more general bug fixes 5.0.74 - more stuff I don't care about 5.0.75 - stuff given to Enterprise users now in community 5.8.76 - more bug fixes that I do not need 5.0.78 - more bug fixes I do not care about (run MS Access on windows not mySQL) 5.0.80 - problem with error messages for concurrency limits that caused an assert failure 5.0.82 - Fixes to fix fixes for this build. 5.0.83 more minor fixes that I don't seem to have a problem from 5.0.84 - more bug fixes for INNODB and latches 5.0.85 - looks like windows fixes 5.0.86 - fixes that I'm not having problems with Therefore, overall, upgrading should give me a boost in performance. My own internal testing sees some tighter memory usage, even though this is not fixed explicitly, the product has matured overall so I can account for the reduction in memory to that. What is Nagios? Nagios IMHO is the best Open Source monitoring system out there. It supports hosts checks, a level to determine on a host level if a box is considered "up". It supports service check, a level to determine if a particular service such as mySQL is up. It has features to log all events to a flat file or to a DB. It can notify you when a service is in a warning state, error state or unknown state. For the purpose of this article, I am going to talk about handling events such as a clearing up swap. First, let us look at some configuration of Nagios. We are going to define a command, then service acting on that command. Let us assume that the nagios install is in /usr/local/nagios. Therefore, in /usr/local/nagios/ a few configuration files are key: - /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg - the command file where the checks are defined - /usr/local/nagios/etc/hosts/-/hosts.cfg - the services file where the checks are defined for execution based on other directives in this file. A command: # 'check_local_swap' command definition define command{ command_name check_local_swap command_line $USER1$/check_swap -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ } This says that check_local_swap executes check_swap with a warning threshold of $ARG1 and a critical threshold or $ARG2 Next when defining a service for a host define service{ use generic-service; Name of service template to use host_name dbfacebook34b ; hostname service_description SYS:Swap ; what shows up in alerts is_volatile 0 check_period 24x7 ; threshold when to check (all the time) max_check_attempts 4 ; threshold to check before marking state event_handler handle-swap ; handle an event (another command) normal_check_interval 5 ; in seconds retry_check_interval 1 ; only try once before reporting the state contact_groups itops ; contact group to send notifications to notification_options w,u,c,r ; need to look this up for all defs notification_interval 600 ; retry sending notifs every 8 mins notification_period 24x7 ; keep sending them check_command check_nrpe!check_local_swap!80%!55% ; execute the event handler and warn like hell } Lots of goodies as you can see. Let us look at the event handler define command{ command_name handle-swap command_line /home/scripts/handle_swap.pl } This means execute this script whenever any event for swap occurs (I decided to make this simple and not put a threshold on this). What does handle_swap.pl do - well it’s a perl script that looks at free memory and if only a few 100K of swap is in use, swapoff -a; swapon -a; In this case, it is a bit safe to do this. Why do this? Why not just turn of swap. I have talked in depth about this subject-but for a minor recap. Linux needs swap else, kswapd will freak out. Swap in DB's is bad so I clean it up automatically since O_DIRECT on my SAN is not an option. Why not just run a cron job? Nagios keeps a log, I like to review what is happening from a central location, and nagios is freaking COOL. For the first time ever I took a two-week vacation. How can a person who has 100s of database servers, 100s of web servers, and a system that supports 100K tps across 20 TB of data is able to take a vacation? Easy, I have a great team that is very competent in managing the platform by following our cookbook routines and guidelines for new application interaction with the databases. Where did I go? I went to NYC-stayed in Tribeca and only ate Pizza, Hotdogs, White Castle and Hala Food from vendors that are nearly on every street corner. I also lost 6 pounds! After three months of half-ass dieting to prepare for my Pizza diet, who would have known that just going for it was the key to success! How did I do it? Well, first I walked to Little Italy, bought 2-4 slices, ate them, and then walked around the city. That is it. As a Database Dude, I do not do much walking except for when I am too tired to run on the treadmill for 20 mins. I was averaging around 10 miles a day for a 12-hour period walking around NYC taking pictures, enjoying the sites, eating, drinking, and then repeat. I even walked from Canal Street all the way to the Staten Island Ferry just because. Man it was great. After NYC, I went to Puerto Rico for the second time. My family and I had a freaking awesome time. We went to the only US National Park that is a Rain Forest. Went to Vieques to the Bio Luminous Bay, where the single cell organisms light up when kinetic energy is applied to them. Went to Culebra, to Flamenco Beach – which is off the hook: much better than any other beach I have been to. Drove around the entire Main Puerto Rican Island stopping off in Rincon and eating every 3-4 hours. I am fully rested and feel like a 20 year old again. So, expect a lot more posts. I think the order will be: Migrate 20 TB of data into a new Format without downtime. How to make Friend Queries work with a database. Throughput increase from Asynchronous Queries.
Okay, please stop laughing. There have been cases of upstarts beating well-established rivals. Before Microsoft Word came along, many of us were using WordPerfect and WordStar. Before Google came along, we used AltaVista and Yahoo. Before Internet Explorer came along, we used Netscape, and now we're watching IE lose ground to Firefox. Trust me, crazy things happen in the technology space. So, it wouldn't be unthinkable for the Zune to give the iPod touch a run for your money.
