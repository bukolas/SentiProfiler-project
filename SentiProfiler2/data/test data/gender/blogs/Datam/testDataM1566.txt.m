I have just finished reading no exit by William Garvin, out now from Harry Godwin's Arthur Shilling Press. Garvin's poems are 'science fiction', but more than that they feel as though they're constellated from the debris or rather the 'glitter trails' of 'science fiction'. So the first poem begins 'strugatsky sequence. diary]' and there's a beautiful short poem called 'Tarkovsky', in which the words are printed so close to the edge of the page it's tempting to believe in something missing, some clue that makes the poem less strange and haunting.
