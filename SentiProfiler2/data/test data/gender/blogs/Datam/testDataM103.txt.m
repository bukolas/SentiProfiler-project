I need a browser which:  - can classify my opened tabs more intelligently. Today, I open 20 tabs on my Safari, Camino, Firefox or Opera, they invariably get slow, making me spend time on closing them or opening them as seperate windows which leads into a MAC tiling nightmare. So I need something that classifies tabs by groups based on their content, allows me to tag them and remains light on the functioning.  - is more social and makes tweeting, plurking, flickring, facebooking all at ease, through a quick drag drop side widget. I remember a people browsr or a social browsr doing a good job. We need such aggregation built into the browser instead of installing multiple widgets that make it slow, or probably there are some and I am not aware?  - is intelligent enough to understand my reading pattern and suggest articles so that I do not get lost in the info. overload of news and intriguing columns, again a classical case of the information overloaded web world we live in.  There should be tons of more improvements in the central nervous system of the browser. Hit me with yours.  And developers out there who agree with me (or my directional sense of thinking), shall we put in some time and moolah and get one up?
