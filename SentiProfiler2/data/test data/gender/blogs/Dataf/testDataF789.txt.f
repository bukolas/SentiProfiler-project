Another learning point has been do not take too much from home with you. For practical reasons I had to bring along school via online classes and my work to help finance this adventure but both have been rather greedy with my time. My aspiration to tap into a deep creative vein here for writing and painting has been blocked by my responsibilities. The creativity is there though. Most days I awake inspired, wanting to sit down to the keys or brush and express what I see and feel but often I sadly must put that impulse aside for work or school.
