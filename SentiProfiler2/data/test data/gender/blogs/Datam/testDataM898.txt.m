I was wondering if any of you follow specific fat burning and muscle building programs? If so do you follow programs that you found online or do you follow programs that are sold in stores or shown in magazines or books? Where exactly do you get your workouts from, if you even follow them that is? And what programs have worked the best for you as far as muscle building?Also I was wondering what you have tried that has helped you build muscle as far as supplements and programs - as I am trying to compare and test against the best muscle building and fat burning programs.
