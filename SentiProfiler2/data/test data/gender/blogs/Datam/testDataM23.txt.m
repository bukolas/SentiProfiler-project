The convention overall went really well. Every year it just seems to get bigger. I've been to a lot of gaming conventions in the Houston area and Owlcon remains the one to go to. A lot of those conventions come and go, but Owlcon has always remained rock steady. I can't wait until next year. This year was a bit special to top it off. Since I won the logo contest, I got to see my design on hundreds of gamers!! I can't really say I was wild about the purple but hey, it was my design on hundreds of gamers!! It was a very cool feeling. To make it all the more better, GURPS game I ran went really well and I even got to catch up with an old Army buddy I used to work and game with. Back when I still wore Army greens to work instead of pajamas, Matt and I used to hobble along company PT runs together at Fort Campbell. We went to AIT together and somehow managed to get the same duty station together for our first (and last) assignment. Both of us not being strong runners on our PT tests, we ended up doing mandatory PT.
