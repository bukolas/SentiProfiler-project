We had a terrible, TERRIBLE storm here over the weekend. We lost power for most of Saturday night, but many people in the area are still without power, there's awful flooding, and the skies have continued to be gray and rainy.

Yuck.

I took the girls to Target today (where else?) just to get them out for awhile, as we are all going a bit stir crazy. On the ride there (which took twice as long as usual due to closed roads and flooding) we listened to our Yo Gabba Gabba cd. About 12 times.

Jack's song (Bedtime Lullaby) came on and the following conversation ensued....

Katie: Jack's song!
LaLa: Yay, Jack's song! Night night baby Jack!
Katie: No, wake up! Wake up Jack!
Me: Baby Jack isnt really asleep Katie. He's up in heaven, remember? Up in the sky!
LaLa: with the sun!
Me: Right! Jack is up in heaven, with the sun and the moon and the stars. He's up there watching over you.

Both girls stare intently for awhile out the window, up at the dark gray sky.

Finally, Charlotte yells:
"Jump!"

Me: What did you say Lala?
LaLa: Jump, baby Jack! Jump!
Katie: Yes, jump Jack! Jump!

The two of them stared expectantly out the car window for awhile, yelling JUMP! Fully expecting to see Jack come jumping down out of the clouds.

That was my little bit of sunshine today.
