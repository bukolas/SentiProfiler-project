I never watched The Wire when it was on TV, just didn't think I'd get into it~
My husband Netflixed the entire series last summer and we watched it together and all I can say is WOW ~ How did this series not win all of the Emmy awards each season?
We could hardly wait for each disc to arrive while we were watching it, not just for Season One either, for every single season~The drug trade and people on the streets were enacted so realistically that I actually felt like I was THERE with each episode~ I especially enjoyed the characters of Marlow, Stringer Bell, and all of the detectives and policemen.
