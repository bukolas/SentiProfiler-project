After a couple weeks on the Job I had become like my 60-68 year old parents, waking up at 5:45 am and going to bed before 9 pm. My social life had been condensed to a quick after work joint with a buddy followed quickly by bed time. This is how I know that life isn't too short. When your doing stuff like this, you often think it couldn't be any longer.

One weekend I had decided that it was time for Max to play. I had been working my butt of and I wanted to party. So, I left work early one Friday in order to catch a good nap before the evening in order to wrangle the necessary energy for later that night. When I got home everything seemed normal and I was able to quickly fall asleep on the sofa in front of the TV.

I was awoken later that evening by my dad. He asked me if I wanted to go for dinner with him because my mom wasn't feeling up to it due to some nausea and she had suggested we just go alone. By the time I had showered and gotten ready my mom's condition had taken a severe turn for the worse. She was lying in bed sweating profusely and complaining of pain in her stomach and back. Ten minutes later she was having trouble breathing and was very weak. Needless to say, we canceled our dinner and took her to the hospital. By the time we got to emergency with her she was mumbling, sweating, and could not walk, let alone later hold herself upright on a chair. I had to carry her through the emergency doors, too weak to even hold her arms by her side, allowing them to hang down toward the floor.
