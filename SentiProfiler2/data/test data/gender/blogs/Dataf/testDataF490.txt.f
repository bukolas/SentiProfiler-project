The party needs to get its act together everywhere. They have not been effective in Parl. No use harping on MS. His days are over. Rahul will be the PERSON to oppose. Who is being groomed for this. The party should have young faces from dalits, obcs, muslims and christians also. They should be visible.In fact constituency wise tickets should be issued right now. And also they should have a shadow cabinet, with appropriate ministers in waiting, talking on key issues in Parliament pertaining to their ministry. No Arun Shourie - BAD. No Yashwant Sinha - GOOD and Jaswanth is out.The party should also explain the structure - President... VP etc, the precedence and stru. A good corporate culture will see them win next elections. Already the wave is building against UPA.
