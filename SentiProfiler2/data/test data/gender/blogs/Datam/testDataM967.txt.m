I cannot believe that this weather is so stable at this time of the year.  It never even reached freezing last night.  The furnace is still going strong on the same load and this is day 3 since I loaded it.  It looks like the driveway is thawed out and dry already and this is only the middle of March.  If this keeps up the deer will be out of the yards and will start heading North where they will be sitting ducks for the first blizzard of the year.  You can bet that we still have another month of Winter coming and it is way too early to start spring chores.  This is not good news, it just portends a long and bad fire season.  

The boss is off to Minnesota for a couple of days to take her niece to school and will probably do a little shopping in the Mall of America with her Sister-in-Law Becky.  I will be on my own with just the dogs for company.  This is an opportunity for me to get started on some outside chores if I can get the body in gear after sitting on my rear end for the last couple of months.  I can almost walk on bare ground all of the way out to the apple trees and now is the time to do some pruning before they start growing again.  I should get a fresh can of pruning paint as I don't remember if I used all of what I had or not.  I think I will also put in some fertilizer stakes to encourage new growth instead of more apples.

I really want to change out the blower for the front loader just to force Mother Nature to dump more snow on us but then I would have to pay someone else to put the blower back on as that requires too much lifting for me to handle.  Without the loader I can't really do much cleanup from the winter as there is going to be a lot of lifting involved and I need to empty the trailer of the sugar beets before they start to ferment.  There are enough of them left over this year that the deer are going to have a real hangover if they try to pig out on them.  I just have to make sure that I get them far enough away from the house that the Brown dog will leave them alone.  I don't know what she would be like if she got into a bunch of fermented beets and I don't want to know either.  Just the thought of her drunk on beets is enough to give me a headache.

I guess that I had better make myself a list of what I want to accomplish this summer, although I know that is just a dream, I can at least pretend to be productive.  First I have to allow time to watch the sun come up while enjoy a hot cup of coffee on the swing.  Later
