I challenge you to try it. This should stop that kind of nonsense. Want a print?   A couple of toy eye balls.Sir Lawrence Olivey-EyeJust because.Also- My goal this week is to start working on more zombie related images.  You love 'em, I love 'em, so why not take advantage of this situation and make more? Sometimes I get ideas that I need to follow through with, even though I'm not sure why.Materials -  One and a half packages of beef jerky ( I ate the other half ).   12 inches tall.I got him to balance for about a minute at a time. Just long enough to take a few photos.This may be the first jerky sculpture on the internet. I couldn't find any others in a quick search. I found a dried beef dress, but nothing else.

Feel free to send me some.Edit Feb. 9 - Thanks to Joe for commenting and leaving this link.  This film was on my mind when I was making this jerky guy.
