"I often compare Backbreaker, weirdly, not to other football games, because we feel it's so different. The game that comes to mind for me is Burnout. Burnout's a driving game, but you don't need to be an expert driver to have fun with that. Because even if you fail in Burnout, you fail spectacularly and it looks cool and it feels good. Even when you've just smashed your car up, it looks really cool.
