I attended the sold-out Muse concert at the GMU-Patriot Center a few weeks back, and they give a fantastic live show. Now, this is a blog about film, so discussing a live concert may seem a little strange. But Muse uses a very impressive sound and light show, including showing sci-fi style video clips. I could include a link to a clip of a live performance here, but instead I've got something better. As long as we're on the topic of short film, here is Muse's music video for their song "Knights of Cydonia". It's a silent kung-fu/space-western set to the song. Check it out:

Lady Gaga: Auteur
I spent the day watching Lady Gaga videos on Youtube (It's spring break, okay?). After watching "Paparazzi" for the fifth time or so I began to dig into past SFFS events/meetings, and I realized that Lady Gaga has come up many many times in our various activities.

Why is this?

I'm not sure whether or not to chalk it up to pure coincidence, or whether to dig deeper into the Lady's prevalence in SFFS activities. Let me give a brief outline of what I'm talking about.

At one of our meetings, when trying to fix a technical problem on the projector, I put on the video "Bad Romance." I knew that the video started off with sound, and since our problem was an audio one, I figured it'd be a useful video to use. After we fixed the problem, we watched David Lynch's "The Alphabet," a short film that I described afterward as a sort of "moving canvas." What was even more telling than this was when member Justin Cousson, about thirty-seconds into the short, said something along the lines of, "Is this another Lady Gaga video?" I laughed at the time, but, now that I'm thinking about it, the aesthetic of the "Bad Romance" video is very Lynchian, which is to say, it's very Kubrickian. For a visual explanation of what I mean, see the following screencap:
