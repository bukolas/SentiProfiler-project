Achieving Quality Living -  If we look around in history also in life around us, there are people who have created history or who are creating history. These are handful of people which you count on fingers while other part of population seems mere existing on the this planet rather than living the life. Just look closely any inspiring figure whether a social workers, reformers, spiritual leaders or Business Tycoons you can take any name say it Martin Luther king or Mother Teresa, or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or Swami Vivekananda, Bill Gates, Henry Ford All these people have same number of minutes in a day as we have. Then why these people able to deliver much more than we do? What make them different from other people. Now this is a wider issue. I am catching one thread of discussion in this post.   If you realize in life we do kind of actions one which are life supporting and other are life degrading. Life supporting actions help us to move forward life life degrading actions bind our legs and put us back. And not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do. Wrong actions come with consequences which takes a huge amount of time and energy to clear it up and come to the ground zero again. Whether these are wrong habits, wrong patterns or wrong decisions.

Sri Sri rightly says, "people spend half of the health to gain the wealth and then spend half of the wealth to gain back health." Not a wise things to do. Same is the case with most of refreshment and entertainment means in society like alcohol, smoking or explicit sex, too much of movies or drugs; all of them come with huge toll on the nervous system. Momentary excitement of senses doesn't give a bliss, yet once mind is trapped in the habit to enjoy these excitements; not doing these things causes huge pain: that's the bondage where most of population has stuck and then there is huge fight to come back to our ground zero state. Similar is the case when we ruin our relationship with somebody and then it become a hassle to recover it. Everybody want good relations with all yet some where we screw it up and then it take so much of efforts to put it back on track and sometime even life time doesn't suffice to recover few issues. So watch carefully next time you choose your words or actions or decision and remember a fact not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn't hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don't supposed to do.

Slowly when we drop the things which we don't supposed to do, life become much more peaceful and expression of success all around.

All Glory to Gurudev
