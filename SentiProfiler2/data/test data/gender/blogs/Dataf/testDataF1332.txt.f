Whatcha got cookin'? Al the Retired Army Guy is a reader of this here blog and a student at the New England Culinary Institute. Here's a quickie blog on of one of his latest projects. From Al: Here are a few pictures of a display platter my classmates and I worked on. If you’re wondering why everything appears shiny, it is because all of the food is coated in aspic (gelatin) to give the food a shine for display purposes only. It isn’t meant for consumption, though you could eat it if you wanted to. I wouldn’t mainly due to the gelatin. Without the gelatin, though--> ;-) In the pictures you will find a terrine, a liver pate, and a duck galantine, as well as two vegetable garnishes. There is also a beet/pickled onion salad, with an orange vinaigrette (you can’t really see the vinaigrette). The single plate represents a single serving of the components contained in the platter. It took us about six hours to put five coats of aspic on every individual piece. The vegetables were individually carved and placed as well. I did the “pointy” rutabaga bases you see, as well as the chioggia beets (the purple ones, carved into fleurons or a crescent shape). I did the orange/white squares you see inside the circular garnish on the right side of the platter. The terrine, galantine, and liver pate were made for us by classmates and our instructor. Overall it was a lot of fun. All the attention to detail I learned while in the Army definitely pays off while doing things like this. - - - Looks good, Al. Now whydontcha come over here and wrangle up something for dinner? - - - Thirteen years ago, I pulled a novel from a bin at the library's used book sale and paid one dollar for it. Sapphire's Push immediately engaged me and I didn't put it down until I'd reached the last page. The book takes stylistic risks, with Precious Jones narrating her own story in a phonetically realistic voice. She is poorly dressed and obese, the sort of person many of us pass on the street and never see. Therein lies the brilliance of the novel. Push puts Claireece Precious Jones and her harrowing life squarely in front of the reader. If this was difficult and compelling to watch unfold on the page , the trailer for the movie Precious indicated it would be stunning on the screen as well. After much consideration, I decided to take my 12-year-old daughter to see Precious. "I was really rooting for Precious," I said as we talked about the movie on the way home. "Me too," said Jessie. I was bowled over by Gabourey Sidibe's portrayal of Precious. If possible, she realized Sapphire's vision with near perfection--as someone who is so easy to dismiss, until you really see her. Then she is impossible not to embrace. To be honest, I had some literary quibbles with the novel, but my respect for the risks it took overwhelmed them. The film has received raves as well as scathing criticism for being "a strange combination of liberal guilt and condescension," which is a point well taken. I apologize that I cannot find the link now, but one of the reviews I read took issue with Precious's weight saying something to the effect of must she be so fat that her face is distorted? Then darling Howard Stern chimed in last week with his obnoxious comments about Sidibe. I was infuriated by this stupidity. Don't these morons realize that the driving force of Precious is a main character who is the antithesis of Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon? Her physical size is symbolic. It's one of the reasons she will not be denied. Whether you're on the pick or pan side of the reviews, that ambition deserves respect. As for Sidibe, I think you're beautiful, Gabourey. Now go bury the likes of Stern with a long and illustrious career. - - - I apologize in advance for this, but some things just have to be gotten through. See what I mean? Now for a random list of observations. 1. No small task keeping the cleft of venus off screen in that footage. Kudos to filmmaker Gary He. 2. Those crystals aren't going to be very jazzly after BooBoo and BamBam have a few rolls in the hay. 3. What if you lose some of those crystals? I mean really lose them? "Um, SugarPop? The one wing of your butterfly is, like, gone." I think we all know just how embarrassing that's going to be. 4. I've always liked Jennifer Love Hewitt. She's not A-list or B-list. She's your A-/B+ list and I can get behind that. Hence, you can imagine my reaction when she goes on George Lopez and announces she's had some spa-person glue beads around her zorch. Who does that? 5. Regarding this exciting new phenomenon, my bud Steven Gould had this to say, "I'm still a guy who prefers hair, uh, hairy, uh, you know. Vahaired." I think he's onto something with "Vahaired." With all this new shit coming down the pike, we're going to need titles, categories--the whole drill. 6. I wonder if there are guys out there with beads stuck around their peckers. I wouldn't ever want to see any dickazzled or ballazzled anything. Nope, regular big hairy guys with beer for me. (Did you notice how I got right behind Steven on the New Age vocabulary job? I'm cool like that.) 7. I bet Snooki is jazzled in places Jennifer Love Hewitt can't even imagine. 8. You've probably noticed by now I'm avoiding the word "vajazzled." It makes me nervous. A word like that lands in your life and boy are you stuck with it. I don't like ultimatums, so I deal with this sort of thing in my own way. Hence this post. 9. I refer to my own pudendum as Glorious Steinem. - - - "I can’t think of anything that I liked in my twenties that I would want tattooed on my body now. Okay, maybe chicken Parmesan, but that would take up too much space." Now go read the rest of my good buddy Paul Ita's latest essay for masslive: My Horrible Tattoo: A Cautionary Tale for America's Young People. - - - The above word cloud is courtesy of Wordle. I cannot get enough of that silly gadget. To have your work instantaneously analyzed and transformed into a piece of literary artwork is like masturbation for writers. After Alex Pruteanu introduced me to it yesterday, I fooled around Wordling this blog, old articles, even my writing bio. The source text for today's Wordle cloud was lifted from an article wherein I recount a professional "girlie" photo session, which explains the photo on the left (yes, that is your humble hostess). You can read the full text of the article here. - - - Fifty degrees and sunny. THE CABIN-FEVER CRAZED O'BRIEN CAN FINALLY WALK OUTSIDE despite all the blasted snowdrifts. Riunite Lambrusco, anyone? Above the bar at Cleve-o mega hot spot Melt. The Goat bought a new GoatMobile. Yay, Goat! The old GoatMobile looked sad when we left it at the dealer. Boohoo and bye-bye, old GoatMobile. Indian spirit money house blessing rainbow incense sticks--only six for a dollar at the discount grocery. Man-o-man, my luck never ends. Sorry, ghost of George Carlin. Come-hither bra display at the low grade closeout store. "Honey, springtime is high time for a new toilet." - - - A post chock full of writing tips for all the young writers who contact me with questions about this crazy business and craft. Last updated 3/8/10. - - - Start local and small. My first paid bit of writing was for Ohio Writer . For my 900-word book review of Judith Hemschemeyer's The Harvest , I was paid the royal sum of $10. That was in June of 2000 (you can see how the next ten years unfolded for me here ). Building a professional writing portfolio and the associated career takes time, and it sprouts from humble beginnings. If I were starting out today, I'd probably fish around for casual blogs associated with professional publications. Many daily and weekly print papers have online blogs that might not pay much, but would be an excellent place to earn a link and a bonafide publishing credential. Who knows? If an editor likes your style, it might lead to something more serious (and lucrative). Bonus tip: Leave a few comments on a blog (under your real name) that you might like to write for before querying the editor with your idea. Small local papers are often looking for writers to cover things like school board meetings and local government. These usually are paying gigs. I spent five years doing that sort of thing for The Broadview Journal . That stint earned me experience, street smarts, clips, a bit of local notoriety, and a steady paycheck. Get involved with a local literary or publishing organization. Here in Cleveland, we have The Lit, Cleveland Digital Publishing Users Group (CDPUG) , and the Cleveland Society of Professional Journalists. These types of organizations host all sorts of events, parties, and classes where you will meet professional writers and editors. If you want to be one of these people, you have to support what they do. That means buying their books, paying the club fees and having a genuine interest in their community. It means learning from them in an organic sense. This is perhaps the most important piece of advice I can offer a new writer. I'm sure there are plenty of online sources as well. Many professional journalists I know are members of Freelance Success for example. Go to the library. There you will find droves of books dedicated to publishing and writing advice. Librarians are wonderful and can always make good suggestions. In my home library, I have a shelf full of Writer's Market editions. Two other good books to start with are The First Five Pages and The Elements of Style. Mind your manners in a cold contact. Don't ask established writers for big favors. Never send them unsolicited writing to critique. Also, don't ask a writer to do your work for you. Finding the right publications to query is hard work. The question, "Where can I publish this?" is almost never appropriate. Get online and start researching for yourself, or go find a copy of the LMP. Follow guidelines. When you're ready to submit, follow the guidelines on the agent's or publisher's site. If there are none, a one-page query is your best bet. NEVER use cutesy fonts or graphics or anything that discredits your professionalism. Get tough. The more successful a writer is, the more rejection they've faced because they toughed it out and lived to submit another day. If you want to achieve success, you will get kicked. Hard. And repeatedly. When you get a rejection, send out another query the same day. It will help you keep your game face on. Sometimes you have to resort to Plan B and rethink your approach or your project, but giving up gets you no where. Your submission or query will likely get rejected again and again--until the one day when it gets accepted. Be warned: there is a growing trend in the publication industry wherein the powers that be simply do not respond to submissions that don't interest them. All you can do about "passive" rejections is keep a meticulous spreadsheet detailing all your queries with dates, names, pertinent websites, etc. Include any special notes as well. How long you wait to give up on getting a response is up to you, although sometimes an agency or publication will have response time info on their webpage. Simultaneous submissions? Again, your call. You are your own publicist. The days of the reclusive and mysterious writer sucking deeply from a Winston before his trusty Royal typewriter are gone. You must represent yourself and you must do it online. Prospective agents and publishers are busy people with no patience for ineptitude. If your information is more than a click away, you'll lose them. I recommend you maintain two types of webpage. This blog is my main active webpage. Content here is frequently updated. Here is my static/informational site. Content there does not change very often. If you are just starting out, your static page might simply include some education and contact information, and your active page may be a twitter account. However you choose to do it, you must have these things. Design, develop and shape them in a way that properly represents you and your work. They will evolve with you. They will surprise you as well. Bonus tip #1: Google Docs is a brilliant tool for creating static public webpages. Bonus tip #2: The way you drive a readership to your blog is by going to other sites that have the sort of readers you are trying to attract and leaving brilliant comments. And now for some miscellaneous links: They don't call it "submission" for nothing. Where I go to bellyache about writing. A whole podcast featuring Erin on Writing. Lastly, a bit of nostalgia. When I was a kid, I had a Mattel Knit Magic toy. You threaded the yarn through this squiggly little thing in the front, turned the crank, and PRESTO! a knitted tube would come out the bottom of the plastic machine. You were supposed to be able to do all sorts of things with the tubes, make groovy hats and stuffed dolls and scarves, but all I ever ended up with was a long tube, (although I did love my Knit Magic machine). When I lead discussions on writing, I often say that there is no Essay Magic machine, wherein you thread an idea in, turn a crank and watch an essay wind out from the bottom. The process I go through in order to produce a good solid piece of writing is laborious, wonderful, frustrating, difficult and satisfying. It has matured through the years. It is important to be in love with your process, to truly revel in the revelations, and savor the small victories. If you focus solely on that "big" publication, you risk missing the small and wonderful things that happen along the way. Write because you have something to say and your own way to say it. Write because you are driven to the craft. Above all, write because we need the good writers. We need their words and observations. We need them to scale and record the human condition. I will likely revise this page from time to time, so stop by again. And if you have good news, bad news, or your own advice to share, please do tell all in the comment section. Best of luck, Erin - - - My daughter had a tummy ache yesterday and we soothed it with many things, including a healthy dose of MTV's Liquid Television, which was one of my favorites shows of all time. We have about six hours of Liquid Television on VHS (taped in the 90s), so there was enough for this tummy ache and the next one as well. It worked perfect-as-you-please in the tape player that's still hooked up to our shitty 20" CRT television. I swear, people, this is how you win. - - -
