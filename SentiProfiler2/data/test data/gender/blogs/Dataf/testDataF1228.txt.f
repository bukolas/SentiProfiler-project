When I got off at Emeryville, I instantly located the bus bound for San Francisco. In less than an hour we were crossing Bay Bridge, passing over Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Alcatraz and the San Francisco city line came into view. We went around San Francisco in six drop off points before we reached the shopping center. I even enjoyed the mini-tour around downtown, the financial district, and the wharf because I got to see other parts of San Francisco that I hadnâ€™t seen previously. Time passed by so quickly. In a few hours, I was in SFO checking in my luggage. But I was glad that in my short stay in the US, I was able to embark on an Amtrak adventure.
