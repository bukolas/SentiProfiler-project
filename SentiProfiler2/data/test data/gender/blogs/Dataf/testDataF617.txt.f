Well, not all of us—but at least the ones who are used to catering to everybody else's needs (and putting off their own dinner)&nbsp;at a certain time of the day. Katahdin Cute Overload It's a funny thing about our sheep shearer —he raises sheep that don't need to be sheared. They're Katahdins, and this hardy breed has hair rather than wool that, as you can see here , comes off each year on its own. One of the biggest problems we face raising our mostly Suffolk meat sheep here in Missouri is internal parasites, specifically a blood sucking stomach worm known as the barber pole or wire worm . For much of the year it's wet and warm here, which, unfortunately, is Parasite Paradise. Despite agressively using both commercial and natural wormers, we've lost numerous sheep over the years to worms—and we've been comparatively lucky. I know of one farmer who had most of her flock drop dead from internal parasites—the day after they'd been wormed. It's terrible. And while there were many benefits to having that extra rain during the past two springs and summers, it made the parasite problem even worse. Ram Lambs Lined Up for Our Inspection (we chose the one on the far left) Katahdin sheep are naturally parasite resistant, and a couple of years ago we got to talking about them with our shearer while he was shearing our sheep. A few weeks later we drove over to his farm and picked out a three-month-old, 75-pound, registered Katahdin ram lamb (whose father was a US champion) to breed to our mostly Suffolk ewes. When Joe saw me squealing over all the corralled cuteness before I could even climb out of the truck, he said it was a really good thing we hadn't brought a big stock trailer. You Carry the Lamb Low so the Mama Can See and Smell It We also got a great deal on two registered Katahdin ewes who each had a newborn lamb by their side, including one&nbsp;who had been born that morning. These were the first ewes I purchased since buying my original flock back in 1995. I've always&nbsp;kept a closed flock, expanding it by holding back the best ewe lambs. The only sheep purchased and brought in were rams, which&nbsp;are replaced every couple of years to avoid inbreeding. The New Ram and the Littlest New Member of the Flock Sadly, the strapping Katahdin ram lamb was killed by coyotes out in the front field the first morning he was let out of his quarantine holding pen. You can read more about that terrible killing season (which, paws crossed, is permanently over thanks to our super livestock guardian dogs, Marta and Daisy ) here . Edward on the Job in Fall 2009 (the girls sometimes play hard to get) Not willing to give up on our plan, we returned to the sheep shearer's farm and picked out another young Katahdin ram. We named him Edward, and in spring 2009, our first Katahdin/Suffolk cross lambs were born. (There are some other breeds mixed in, bred down from some of my original mixed breed ewes, from the Border Leicester ram I used the first few years, and from a wonderful Hampshire ram we had in 2002 and 2003.) We also bred the two Katahdin ewes&nbsp;with Edward in order to get some more purebred Katahdins, and they each had twins. Emmy Lou Back Then And Emmy Lou Now The Katahdin ewe lamb that arrived here as a newborn, and who I recently (finally!) named Emmy Lou, was also bred when Edward jumped through 11 strands of barbed wire in order to continue breeding season (another story I never got around to telling). She gave birth in spring 2009 to this little cutie pie we named Friendly. The other newborn lamb was a ram, and he eventually went into our freezer so we could see how we liked the taste of Katahdin meat (it's very good). That gave us a total of seven purebred Katahdin ewes to breed. We've been thrilled so far with these Katahdin and Katahdin crosses and have high hopes going into spring grazing season, which is one of the wormiest times of the year, especially since hormones in the nursing ewes make them especially susceptible. We're still aggressively worming, but now we're mostly using a drench (liquid squirted into the throat with a drench 'gun' connected to a 'backpack' holding the liquid) of organic raw apple cider vinegar and garlic juice. - We're also still adding diatomaceous earth, an all natural wormer (which has dozens of other uses, especially in the garden), in with both their grain treats and salt/mineral mix. Our sheep have never looked better. Even the lambs of the ewes who had bad parasite problems last year aren't wormy. Okay, I hadn't planned to go all the way back to 2008 to begin the explanation of why our 2010 lambing season started several weeks earlier than expected, but I've actually been meaning to explain how and why we now have Katahdins ever since we got them, especially&nbsp;since many of you have been asking. Anyway, when I called the sheep shearer to arrange this year's shearing , I asked if he happened to have any big Katahdin ewes for sale, big enough to breed with our big Suffolk ram, Da Big Guy, and he said yes. He had some pregnant six-year-olds for sale who were good sheep with nothing wrong except that they were six years old (many sheep breeders prefer to not to keep ewes older than five). He even could deliver them when he came to shear. I asked him to pick out the two biggest ewes, and he brought us these gorgeous girls—who both had triplets last year. My main concern with the Katahdins is that we're going to lose the nice big size we've built up over the years with the Suffolks. I prefer to butcher the lambs at about 130 or even 140 pounds, and the purebred Katahdin lambs aren't getting that big. You just don't get as much meat otherwise. We always take the smallest lambs for ourselves, and some years they've only been about 100 pounds, but our customers prefer them bigger (some want them over 150 pounds if possible)—and since the butcher charges a flat processing fee, they also get more for their money with bigger lambs. In 2004, we started naming all babies born on the farm alphabetically: 'A' names for 2004, 'B' names for 2005, etc. It makes things so much easier (and only took me nine years to come up with the idea). Some of you know how long it can take to get a name around here, but amazingly, we've already named our new ewes who were born back in the 'A' year. This is Ava And this is Audrey Ava—whose full name is Ava Gardener so we can remember that these ewes came to live with us in 2010, the 'G' name year—gave birth to these incredibly cute twins last Monday. You can see more photos of them here and here . Audrey just keeps getting bigger. The rest of the ewes should start giving birth around April 1st! Can't wait?

If you're already using the 'last line of defense' wormers like Dectomax and Cydectin and are wondering what you're going to do when your sheep build up an immunity to it, organic garlic juice—which is being studied as a natural wormer specifically because of that looming sheep industry problem—just may be your saving grace. © Copyright 2010 FarmgirlFare.com , the sheep loving foodie farm blog where Farmgirl Susan shares recipes, photos, and sometimes very long stories about her crazy country life on 240 remote Missouri acres. Sea of Sheep Cute So who are all these lambs and how are they related to our early start to lambing season? The whole story should be up tomorrow. No, really, I mean it this time. It's even all written, and I was hoping to finish it tonight, but today kind of got away from me—partly because the story ended up&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;longer than planned, and partly because I spent about six hours this morning working on a total blog makeover (so exciting, but what a time suck).

Not a Recipe © Copyright 2010 FarmgirlFare.com , the whupped foodie farm blog where between putting up a longer than planned kitchen garden blog post about growing onions (do you grow onions? come chime in!) and yet another trip to town (this time to spend a whopping $477 on new tires for the flatbed trailer that we only use a couple of times a year but are never able to use because it always has three flats), today's post is shorter than planned. Now there's a piping hot homemade pizza topped with homegrown beef pepperoni, a Harry Potter DVD, a comfy reclining loveseat, and an equally whupped hunky farmguy calling my name, so I'll see you (after yet another trip to town in the name of vintage tractor repair) tomorrow. And They Always Feel So Peaceful I know I promised an explanation today for our surprise early start to lambing season, along with more cute baby pictures (there's still just the one set of twins on the ground), but while I was out walking around this beautiful morning I started thinking that maybe some of you might also be feeling as if you're running in circles while being pulled in a million directions at once, yet hardly getting anything done ( still unposted winter recipes, anyone? ) and could use a quiet little moment of peace. I'll be back later today or (more likely) tomorrow with the story and another dose of baby lamb cute (they are so cuddly). In the meantime, don't forget to stop and breathe it all in. And again.

The short version is that our lambing season has started several weeks earlier than originally planned, and this Katahdin hair sheep mama and her twin lambs, who were born just before we got back from town (of course), are doing just fine. The brown one is a boy, and the white one is a girl.
