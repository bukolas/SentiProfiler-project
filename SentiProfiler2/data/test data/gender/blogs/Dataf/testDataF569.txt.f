Alarm clock buzz, shower time, corn flakes with bananas, ride to work, work-work-work, hit the gym, socialize, dinner, zzzzs and repeat.A few people have asked why I haven't written.  The first response is that I have been working all day, everyday, but when I really thought about it, I didn't have anything exciting to write about.  How about that... life in Kabul is normal. Sure I have some funny stories, but they are not PG-rated, so you are going to need to skype me for those. A month ago, when I was getting on a plane, never would I have though that life in Kabul would feel so (dare I say it) normal.   Wednesday I am going to a new yoga class and Friday we are going shopping.  Today was so beautiful I spent 3 hours reading reports outside in the gleaming sunshine.  Everyday, I meet more fantastically brilliant people.  The work is getting better by the day.There are down sides, as there are to anything, but I prefer to look up.  So as I settled in, I would love to hear about your adventures.
