Haai, so why is it that when we're left alone, we get paranoid; thinking up a storm of all the worst things that you can possibly come up with. I mean, why do you have to make sense of everything, why can't we just accept something for what it is. Why do we tend to analyze situations that have relatively made slight alterations in it's rather usual straight pattern. What's amazing is when things are back to normal, we so easily forget all the accusations and bogus imagery that went on up in there.

It's annoying that so many things were running through my mind in one particular episode. Thinking back, I feel pretty stupid for thinking and assuming such things.

I feel so, common.
