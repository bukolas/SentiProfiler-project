We have been going to Montana and Wyoming for about 14 years. We love it!!Such a beautiful part of the country and so much to do for a family.The kids loved riding around looking for buffalo and seeing the gysers and the paint-pots. Such a great family bonding time! Highly recommend a trip into Jackson Hole, WY to see the Tetons and then driving into Yellowstone and going to Big Sky, MT and through the park. Never a dull moment and different every time you visit. It's an ideal location no matter which season it is too!
