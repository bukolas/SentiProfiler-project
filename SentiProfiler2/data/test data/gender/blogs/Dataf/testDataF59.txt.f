Possums Will Eat Anything.

 I'm in such a weird place in my life right now. I'd love to say I'm at a crossroads, but that implies I have some very clear direction to either side of me and that's not the case. I'm more inclined to want to say I'm at a roundabout.


I can choose to make an exit at some point in the circle and see how that works for me or I can keep going round and round and round.

At the moment, let's just say I feel sort of dizzy. 


As I write, I'm at my daughter's house sitting in the baby's room. I should specify there is no actual baby in this room yet. He is currently living at 100 SW. Uterus with an estimated arrival date of July 3. He's a pistol, this one. Kitten's tiny 5'2" body has had a heck of a time trying to accommodate this fella. Today we found out she has hydronephrosis, which is no damn fun. She's in pain and she pees roughly every 1.3 seconds.


I made her banana pudding - cause that's what Southern mommas do when they don't know what else to do. 

I took her to IHOP and bought her a man-sized breakfast at 3 in the afternoon. When the waitress asked "bacon or sausage" Kitten said "BOTH!" I just drank my coffee, ate my French Toast and tried to keep my fingers away from the consumption zone.



The only other time I've ever heard noises like I heard coming from my baby girl was when I was married to my second husband living large in rural Hell and I found a possum eating something one of the farm cat's had thrown up.

You're welcome.


Right now, at this very moment, I can hear Kitten & Dog (my son) laughing hysterically from the other room. They each have such distinct laughs, but they share an insane sense of humor, which I like to believe they got at least in part, from me. I adore them so much. They know I love them, of course. I'm just not sure they understand I'd totally make them banana pudding for breakfast from now until forever if it made them happy. That's probably a good thing. 

So round and round I continue go. But right now, in this blue room, listening to the most beautiful sound on Earth, it's OK. I'm OK.

I may even try it with my eyes closed.
