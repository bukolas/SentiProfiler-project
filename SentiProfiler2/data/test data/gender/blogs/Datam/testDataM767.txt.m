The sequel to high and dry posted some months ago. Yet another fantastic village church, this one is in Grindon and on this day was at the limit that i could drive to with out getting stuck. A very cold winters morning on the side of Rudyard lake View of a refurbish cottage on the road at the front of the Roaches Another shot of the hut, this time including the fantastic view it has got. Sitting waiting for the snow to go, at the back of the cement works. Still clearing out the snowy shot, this one is from Boxing day and was taken down stream from 3 Shires head. Another Keepers cottage, this one on the canal out side Denford.
