I was watching a show on Plane Crashes. They were saying it's not one event that causes a crash but a series of events that leads to the crater. Damn that sounds like my life! Yah there's a lot of things we can do to hedge our peace of mind but what's the bottom line? our happiness or peace of mind because they're not the same.
Yah I could have got an MBA bought a tire store in some corner of the world and lived out my life golfing raising five kids with the wife and making a difference in Kawanis. If this is you God bless you. I've lived my life listening to that subtle whisper in me "keep asking more of yourself keep growing!" My art is  humor my canvas my life. There isn't a single time I haven't been on stage that I haven't learnt something. I have chosen a life of pressure: corporate comic, comedy clubs, teacher, Key note speaker but there are things I can do to guarantee results: Keep finding ways to reinvent myself, keep looking at my goals and make sure my habits grow with them, keep re discovering ways to grow in my industry.
I thought about the events that lead to a wreck. I can use this same criteria to examine my personal  program. When I first began stand up my inner thought was panic. All my results came from that. Panic was what I sent out and what I got back. My thought now is " let's explore follow me."
My results are discovery and growth. If single events lead to result make sure your core thought is attracting the results you want. Our core thought determine whether we fly or crash achieve our destination or stay stuck.
