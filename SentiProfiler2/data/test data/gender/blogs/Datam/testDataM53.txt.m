I checked the traffic ahead through the portion of the windshield of the auto which was not covered with Rajni stickers. I was precariously holding on to the dozen plastic bags full of cheap clothing accessories I had bought from Ranganathan Street. “Shit! The traffic is too heavy. I hate Chennai for this.”  As I completed the statement a truck moved close to the auto releasing sooty smoke into the cramped interior of the auto. I strained hard to close my nose with my palm without losing hold on any of the bags.  “Shall I hold some of them?” Sheela offered. I handed over a couple of bags, and checked her face in the rear view mirror of the auto. Beads of perspiration were flowing down her forehead, wetting the sandal in the center. But unlike my weary face, her countenance showed no signs of impatience or irritation.  “Do you need to go home urgently?”  “Not really. But this traffic and pollution is too much to bear.”  She kept looking out of the window at the passing vehicles like a foreign tourist admiring the ethnic beauty of the place.  I looked at the auto driver’s face on the rear view mirror and noted that he too was thoroughly irritated with the traffic and felt some solace for having someone equally irritated with the circumstances.  I turned to see if Sheela was done with admiring the traffic and realized she would never stop. I had met her in the T Nagar bus stop, waiting for a Besant Nagar bus just like me. After seeing the buses overly crowded, she asked if we could share an auto ride. “How is your new job?”  “Well, it is no longer new, but it is good. What about you? Did you … er…”  “Yeah… I got a job. I am a junior accountant at a financing firm.”  “Oh cool… I felt guilty the other day when you said you missed your interview.”  “Hey you don’t have to feel guilty. I might not have gotten selected after all. I don’t regret anything at all.” “It is rare to see someone who doesn’t regret anything.”
