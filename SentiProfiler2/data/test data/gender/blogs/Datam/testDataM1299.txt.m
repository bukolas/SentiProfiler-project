Once your application gets to the hiring committee, the hope is that they've already heard of you. But if they haven't, hopefully they've heard of at least one of your letter writers. When we get applications, I typically first sort by whether I've heard of the applicant, then by the number of letter writers they have that I've heard of, then loosely by the reputation of their university. And I make my way down the list, not always all the way to the bottom. (Okay, I've only done this once, and I think I got about 90% of the way through.) In my experience, what we've looked for in applications is (a) a good research statement, including where you're going so as to distinguish yourself from your advisor, (b) a not-bad teaching statement (it's hard to get a job at a research university on a great teaching statement, but it's easy to lose an offer on a bad one... my feeling here is just to be concrete and not to pad it with BS -- if you don't have much to say, don't say much), (c) great letters, and (d) an impressive CV. You should expect that the hiring committee will read some of your papers before interviewing you. This means that if you have dozens, you should highlight somewhere (probably the research statement) what are they best ones that they should read. Otherwise they'll choose essentially randomly, and (depending on your publishing style) this could hurt. As always, put your best foot forward and make it easy for the hiring committee to find out what's so great about you. Anyway, that's basically it. There's lots more at interview stage, but these are my feelings for application stage. I'd be interested to hear if my characterization of the hiring process is vastly different than at other universities; plus, if there are other openings that might be relevant to NLP/ML folks, I'm sure people would be very pleased to seem them in the comments section. Good luck, all your graduating folks!
