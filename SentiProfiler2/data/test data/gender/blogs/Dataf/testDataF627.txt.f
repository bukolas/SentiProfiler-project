I could not let the day pass without letting all the Blogland residents know that we lost one of our citizens today. The beautiful and wonderful Renee, lost her battle with cancer last night. I know we are all happy that she is no longer in pain. She is dancing with the angels right now, she is free. Renee, was a special woman and she taught us so much. Many in the blogging community are grieving right now. I know she is watching and wanting us to be happy. Sending hugs and love to all who miss her. xoxo My life would not be the same without dogs. At the moment we have two female schnauzers. Our miniature schnauzer Yazou is getting old, but with daily medication for her heart and a bit of our patience during the walks... we can manage alright together. Our standard schnauzer Bella is four years younger and likes to play and run like a puppy. They both are really sweet dogs. But I think every dogowner says so :-)   Anyway, someone sent me an advertisement of Pedigree dogfood. They have filmed dogs in slow motion while catching a small piece of food and that is really beautiful to see, I think. But you better look for yourself!
