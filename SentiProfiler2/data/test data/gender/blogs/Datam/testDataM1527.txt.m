I am hoping against hope that President Obama (I can't remember when I have to capitalize "president") can be successful, and not just because I'm a Democrat. I am kind of tired to hear the same old opinions that the stimulus plan is too much spending, while at the same time not providing enough tax relief for the upper income brackets. Can't anyone acknowledge that supply-side economics didn't work?
