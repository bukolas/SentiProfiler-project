As my eyes were paralyzed to the sky I remember all the movements and formats waltzing through the air to the sounds of laughter and enjoyment.  It was a parade of unique forms drifting higher and higher as strings lengthened and feet marched.  They were human created birds surrendering to the wind and I was a child mesmerized by the fascination known as flight.  And it happened once a year in Franklin Park.  Many gathered and celebrated the art of flying kites.  I can remember sitting Indian style on freshly renewed spring grass trying to fit my tiny mouth around over bloated, slightly burned hot dogs and just watching all forms of kites taking formation in a sky that always seemed so bright on festival day.   My mother’s boyfriend, Curtis, bought me this huge Superman looking kite and they spent much time putting it together and getting the strings just right.  I didn’t quite grasp the concept of flying kites but I looked forward to seeing mine lifted as high as it could go.
