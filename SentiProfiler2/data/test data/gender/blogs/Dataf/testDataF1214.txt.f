Mrs. Clinton, I work in health care and see many places where we can improve our system and still provide care for everyone. The first line of care should be the primary care physician (PCP). There are not enough doctors going into primary care to provide adequate care. The PCPs we have are overworked and overbooked. I worked as a case manager in the emergency department of a major trauma center and medical school. We cater to many of our non-funded patients, and the number of ED visits would be greatly reduced if PCPs were available to everyone. If people could get a same day or next day visit, or at least be able to contact their PCP by e-mail.
