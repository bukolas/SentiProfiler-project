Alone for so long walking down the path of darkness with a lamp to guide my journey of life, the fates gust by the light goes out and I stand alone in the darkness wondering why.I continue to walk down the path not seeing anything but shadows and figures that speak of evil of man.

I pray and hope for an angel to walk with me as a guide and friend, soon in the midst of the darkness a glow begins, a path is laid before me showing me a place to call home. As I walk down this path I come upon a woman with a bright smile that let's my heart know all will be good. at first she was a stranger who offered nothing but kindness and love.

My angel shares her heart and pain with me as we walk beside each other on this path. I never knew of such kindness and love, a motherâ€™s love I never known the scars and fears that led to the dark path I took. Slowly the angel became my best friend and mother. Thankful for the blessings and kindness she gave to me. Through are pains together she has loved and stood by me, its fate that the woman who lost her son found one and the son who never had a mother found his. The path is brighter and easier now that my mother angel is with me .I has found peace in my life through the love and friendship of another who was hurt and lost likes I. My mother angel is my guardian, my keeper, my mother and best friend. I thank god for the blessings I have in this path I take. My biggest blessing is the mother I've found to me that's the greatest gift of all.
