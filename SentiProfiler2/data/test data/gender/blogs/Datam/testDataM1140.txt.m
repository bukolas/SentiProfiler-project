Pressure Cooked Stock 2: Changing Pressures, Playing with Chemistry

This is our second post on the benefits and pitfalls of pressure cooking stocks. See the first post here.   

We recently bought a fancy new pressure cooker, in which to do fancy new tests. It’s actually a pressure canner/sterilizer—which lets me work with higher volumes and with higher pressures. First we investigated which pressures are best for cooking chicken stock and veal stock.  Second,  we tested to see if we could increase flavor extraction by treating stocks with a strong base. This test was suggested  by our reader Schinderhannes,  and it turned out to be a doozy.  


Our fancy new pressure device, the All American Sterilizer, 25 quart.
A Brief Recap  

The right pressure cookers can make stocks that are superior to traditional stocks.  In our tests, pressure cookers that vent steam while cooking made stocks that were browner and had better aroma than traditional stocks—but they tasted worse, were less balanced, and were more muted than traditional stocks.  Pressure cookers that did NOT vent steam beat conventional stocks by all criteria.  I know, it’s counterintuitive that the vented pressure cooked stocks would have better aroma  but taste worse (wouldn’t the aroma have vented off?), but we verified our results with repeated blind tastings.   


Our Iwatani pressure cooker regulates pressure by venting steam. The gauge on the right is unreliable and cannot be trusted to regulate pressure.
It seems like pressure cooked stock should always beat traditional stock because: 

There isn’t much turbulence inside a pressure cooker, so cloudiness is reduced.
Higher extraction temperatures extract flavor more completely.
Higher temperatures encourage more delicious “high temp flavors,” such as the meaty flavors caused by increased protein breakdown.
The sealed pressure cooker should preserve volatiles.
Why venting pressure cookers underperform is still a mystery to me.  But they always do.

A Note on our New Pressure Cooker
The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry Company (WAFCO) has been making the “All American” line of pressure canners since 1930. Their pressure canners are made entirely of aluminum and are usually big (up to 41 quarts). Pressure canners are designed primarily to sterilize jars and cans for home canning—not to cook in. The standard pressure canner regulates pressure with an adjustible weight, so once working pressure is reached, it vents steam—bad. You can make the weight heavier and use the very nice and accurate gauge to regulate pressure up to about 18 or 19 psi without venting, but to really go high-pressure you want a pressure sterilizer. Pressure sterilizers are used by dentists and tattoo artists; they are basically inexpensive autoclaves.  Our WAFCO canner converts to a sterilizer just by changing out the lid.   We have the 25 quart stovetop model.  


Sterilizer Top. The valve on the right can be flipped off and on to vent as desired, but won't leak steam till you hit 25 psi. Be careful. On sterilizers this valve is connected to a long tube inside the pot. If the tube is underwater, pressurized hot liquid will spray everywhere when the lid is vented.
The pressure sterilizer will not vent  steam unless you release the valve or take the unit above 24.5 psi. It is dead quiet. A regular pressure cooker at 15 psi reaches 250° F (121° C). My pressure sterilizer running at 24.5 psi reaches 266° F (130 ° C).   


The All American Sterilizer gauge. This gauge works. Here it is reading 24.5 psi which equals a blistering 266° F (130° C). Any more pressure and the sterilizer auto vents.
The 25 quart pot heats rather slowly, and it takes a while to get the hang of regulating pressure by adjusting the gas—I plan to build a temperature regulator soon. Be careful with the sterilizer. It has a tube on the bottom of the lid. If that tube goes under the surface of your cooking liquid, the vent valve will spray hot liquid when opened. In these tests we cooked our food in stainless bains that we put inside the pressure sterilizer.  

One quirky feature of these pots: they have a  metal-on-metal seal, with no rubber gasket.   


The All American sterilizers and pressure canners use an all-metal gasketless seal.
Test Number 1, Changing Pressures   

We ran this test on previously prepared stocks so we could eliminate ingredient variables.  The tests discussed in our first pressure post indicate that pressure cooking a previously prepared stock produces similar results to creating a stock entirely in the pressure cooker.   We treated white chicken stock and brown veal stock  in five different ways, as follows:   

Heat briefly on the stove (control 1).
Pressure cook in a venting pressure cooker at 15 psi for 30 minutes (control 2).
Pressure cook at 15 psi for 30 minutes.
Pressure cook at 20 psi for 30 minutes.
Pressure cook at 24 psi for 30 minutes.

Pressure tasting: Brown veal stock on top, white chicken stock on the bottom. 15 psi non-vented was the winner, followed by regular.
You can see that higher pressures = browner color.  Chicken and veal stocks reacted similarly at the same pressures, so I’ll discuss them together.  Confirming our previous results, stovetop was better than 15 psi vented, but not as good as 15 psi.  The aroma of 15 psi vented was superior to both stovetop and 15 psi unvented—bizzare. 20 psi had a good aroma, some thought better than 15 psi unvented, but its taste was muted.  The 24 psi stock was the brownest by far, but smelled and tasted dead.  We need to run tests between 0 and 15 psi to determine optimum pressure.  

Result:  15 psi non-vented chicken and veal stocks were the winners.  

Test Number 2, Adding Lye:   

This one gets a little weird. Friend of the blog and pro-chemist Schinderhannes suggested that we try to increase the meaty flavor of stocks by disrupting the proteins with a strong base (like sodium hydroxide, also known as lye), pressure cooking them, and neutralizing the base with a strong acid (like hydrochloric acid).   Don’t get freaked out, we aren’t serving this to people—it was just a test.  

There’s something very appealing about Shinderhannes’ proposal.   Lye ( NaOH) + Hydrochloric acid (HCl) combine to make water and table salt (H2O and NaCl).  The trick to not poisoning people is neutralizing the lye.  

We don’t have access to high grade lye, so we used this:  


100% lye drain cleaner. Lye is NaOH. Don't do this at home.
Don’t use this stuff.  I don’t want to hear about you getting hurt. Eating only a small crystal will do severe,  irreparable damage to your insides.  My doctor mom used to tell me horror stories of kids who came into the ER after eating drain cleaner. Anyway, we prepared two identical batches of chicken meat and water, added some 33% lye solution to one (we added 0.5% by weight NaOH to the stock), and pressure cooked them both for 45 minutes in a non-venting pressure cooker at 15 psi.  Here is what they looked like:  


Two pressure-cooked stocks, normal on the left, with added lye on the right.
The difference is pretty plain.  The lye stock is still poisonous at this point so we need to add hydrochloric acid to neutralize it.  Problem is, I can’t get pure hydrochloric acid, so I went to the hardware store for muriatic acid, which is fairly concentrated HCl, used to clean tiles.  We added enough HCl to get a neutral reading on our pH meter.  Look what happened:  


Pouring in acid to neutralize the lye-stock caused a weird precipitation reaction.
Whoa! The stock turned white and clouded up.  I tasted it to make sure it wasn’t poison.  It wasn’t.  Then we figured out how much salt to add to the normal stock to match the salt created in the lye stock acid base reaction.  


Our chemistry set: Muriatic Acid Tile Cleaner (HCl), 100% Lye Drain Cleaner Solution (NaOH). Kosher salt (NaCl), pH Meter, Buffer Solutions.
Here is Nastassia tasting them blind.  


Since the stocks looked very different we tasted with our eyes closed.
Well, the normal stock won.  The lye stock tasted a little weird.  The next day the lye stock looked even stranger:   


After resting overnight, the lye stock (on the right) had a bunch of goop floating in it and smelled of lye.
The stock on day 2 smelled and tasted strongly of lye.  I’m  guessing the lye was trapped in the precipitate that formed when we added the acid, and it leached out overnight.  The lye taste was still present after we got rid of the cloudy stuff in our centrifuge. 

All in all, not a ready-for-prime-time technique, but a fun experiment.

Whole Fish à la Cooking Issues

Pretty picture of a fish in oil
Cooking a large whole fish is challenging.  It’s easy to overcook the outside, leave the inside raw, or both. This problem keeps cropping up for me. You see, my stepfather Gerard has three interests: drinking wine, smoking cigars, and  surf casting for striped bass. He’s an accomplished fisherman, and he catches nice big guys –36-40 inches — along the beaches of Cape Cod, whereupon he delivers them to me. When I cook for my family,  I like to cook family style. I want to serve a fish whole, and naturally I want to serve it fried. For years I just bent the suckers into a “U”, dusted them with flour, and chucked them in my deep fryer. They were good, but, truth be told, the outside was overdone and the inside wasn’t really done at all. No one noticed because I served pla pad prik style, with a generous amount of spicy Thai curry.  But Nils and I have worked out a better technique with the miracle of low temperature cooking (low-temp and sous-vide primer soon to come).

Many fish, like salmon and mackerel, don’t hold up well when cooked for a long time at low temperatures.  Their enzymes keep working while the fish is cooking, breaking down the muscle and making it mushy.  The same holds true for crustaceans.  Some of these fish also taste terrible when they’re cooked to safe bacteria-killing termperatures:  Salmon served warm, for example, shouldn’t be cooked much above 50 C for taste, but anything below 50 C is actually growing bacteria. Stripers, however, are made for low temp cooking. They don’t deteriorate in the 2.5 hours it takes to cook them low temp. and they do fine cooked all the way up to 57 C –a perfectly safe temperature. 

So how do you low-temp a striper?  They won’t fit in a vacuum machine and you don’t want to poach them.  A striper just fits into the wide roll foodsaver bags, and for a while this is how we cooked them.  I’ve been told that few things are more amusing than watching Nils and me try to get the foodsaver to vacuum the air out of a 42 inch long food saver bag that’s  bent into a U and full of fish and oil.   The “U” is a necessity: otherwise the fish won’t fit in the fryer.

One serendipidous day we had to cook a striper and we couldn’t locate any foodsaver bags — so we just filled our circulator bath with oil.  Easy, delicious, though more expensive (cause you need all that oil).  It’s our preferred method now, and here it is on a 40 inch striper:
