Down the hallway, murky with shadows was a heavy door that opened into the esophagus of a stairwell. Descending the stairs led to another heavy door. This led to the outside world.

Outside and across the walkway was the carefully knitted wire with its elegant teeth and its numbing electricity that hissed in the rain. Outside was the ashe grey sky and the snapping cold. Outside was the hard ground crusted over like a scab. Under foot the scab would crackle and crunch, old bitter bones and sun damaged glass. Very little grew here, only the twisted wees and the mold and the rotting fungi. These preferred the shadows, the corners, the folds of the building. Here in the folds as in the folds of a fat man moisture collected and the skin of the building chaffed. A small film of ooze caressed the inner most skin where soil and foundation met.

Walking beside the building with long lazy strides one passes several entrances all leading into a series of passageways or office spaces. Here, within the nerve center information was processed and evaluated. Papers were typed. Numbers were transcribed. Efficient men and women sifted through their work with precision and efficiency, neat and crisp like their uniforms.
