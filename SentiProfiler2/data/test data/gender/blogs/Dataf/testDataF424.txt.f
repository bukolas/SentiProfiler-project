In the afternoon, after our Apo Island escapade, I lounged into a beach chair underneath a coconut tree, overlooking the beach and the island. The cool breeze and the quiet ambiance at Malatapay were relaxing to the mind.  But my interlude was cut short as we had to pack our things and head back to Dumaguete. Although we wanted to stay a bit longer, we had to bid Malatapay Beach Resort adieu. Till our next visit.
