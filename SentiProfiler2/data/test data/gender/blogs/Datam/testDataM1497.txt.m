I just got off of a midnight flight home from a hectic weekend. When I opened my suitcase to unpack it, there was the little note saying that TSA had opened my luggage to inspect it. There was also a bite-size 3 Musketeers bar. IMMD. via itmademyday.com If they did that every time, nobody would mind.

So do cows "When you move it back, those cows are holding that milk for an extra hour, so you can run into some health problems," he said. ... Michael Downing, who detailed the history of daylight-saving time in a 2005 book [ Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time ], says the U.S. government has misled Americans on the economic benefits of the time switch. The biggest beneficiaries of the spring clock change aren’t consumers but retailers. People shop more when there’s more light at night. Tonight's the night... (Yes, this post is a rerun . And I'll keep saying it until we drop all this nonsense and Leave the Damn Clock Alone .)) via failbooking.com Oh, please, have mercy... I'm laughing, I'm crying, I can't breathe, I'm dying here.

The ones that sometimes show up on every channel at the same time -- but you can't remember their names? You can look 'em up here.

Posted via web from Dreaded Purple Master School Accused Of Spying On Kids In Their Homes With Spyware That Secretly Activated Webcams from the horrifying dept A whole bunch of you are sending in this absolutely horrifying story of a school district outside of Philadelphia that apparently gave its students laptops that included hidden software that allowed district officials to secretly turn on the laptops' webcams and monitor student activities, no matter where they were. This all came to light when a student was disciplined for " improper behavior in his home " with the evidence being a photo of the kid from his laptop webcam. The district is now being sued for this. It's rather stunning that anyone thought this was a good idea. via techdirt.com I have a webcam built-in to my laptop. I can't remove it. Maybe I need a piece of tape, or a band-aid, or something.
