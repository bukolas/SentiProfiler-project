Final Fantasy XIII is finally out on PS3 and Xbox 360. Square-Enix’s newest adventure eschews the visiting towns/talking-to-people/choices focus of the previous games in the series in favor of a new battle and story-heavy system. And whether you enjoy it on the PS3 or pretend it doesn’t bother you that the Xbox 360 version is terrible, you’ll have a lot of free time on your hands watching those FMVs and hitting those “Auto-Battle” commands. So while you’re waiting, why not play a drinking game?
Take A Shot Every Time You promise yourself the game will get better than this. You run straight. Someone says the word “hero.” You read the Datalog to understand what the hell just happened. You look at the box to make sure it’s actually a Final Fantasy game.
