The black rock on the left is obsidian I found at a hunting cabin we go to once or twice a year. Obsidian itself I find to be interesting, but in this case, it's not just the fact it's obsidian that makes it unique. If you look closely, you can see concentric rings on the forward face. This is caused to glass by a hard impact, for example if you've ever seen glass that has been shot with a BB gun. Second to that, this obsidian was found in what had previously been american indian territory very far from any volcanic areas. While it's possible it arrived there in another manner, I find it most likely that it had been traded for from a far away place by a group of indians and was discarded in the process of flint-mapping an arrow. Besides this glass being around, there are also grinding holes in many rocks, guaranteeing the presence of indians in the past.

The rock to the right of the obsidian is black and what I see as orange in a striated pattern and was found in a riverbed. The patterning shows significantly better when wet. Besides liking the coloration of this stone, I am struck by its similarity to the flesh of fish.

The next two stones were found at a beach. The one on the left appears to be made of a conglomeration of soft and hard stones and this is demonstrated by the way the stone has worn, leaving protruding bands of the harder yellow stone. The next one appears to be sediment condensed into stone, including shells which cause the white, slightly pearlescent layers. The stone that is not like shell has a green tinge, which suggests it originated from a fairly good depth of populated water.
