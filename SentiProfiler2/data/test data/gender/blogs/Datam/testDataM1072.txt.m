My life will take A different change for 2010. I plan on leaving AT&T for long term while I plan to join either the Air force or the Army. There I will study what I have always wanted to study which is computers. This year will be a year of study as I call it. It will be to learn what this new life holds in store for me. It will also be a year of getting closer to my family and friends while I am here in El Paso. It will be very hard to leave them. They know who they are. I thank them for everything they have done for me in times of good and it times of bad this year. One in particular (you know who you are) I am going to miss you the most. I plan to spend New Years Eve with her. I want her to be there when 2010 turns for the world. She is going to be my guest of honor for MY New Years 2010. My 24th birthday is the last one here in El Paso. I will enlist in February, probably be in basics by March Or April. May or June will bring my career training. By 2011 I’ll have a full military career. I’ll be far away from home to live and do what I want to do. I’ll be living my life the way I want to though, under no ones control like the way it was before.
