This morning, artist/sculptor Mike Kraus sent me images of the clay mold he has recently completed of the sword that will soon be replaced on the General James Nagle statue. Simply stated, I am blown away by the level of detail. Indeed, this is an exact rendering of the sword Nagle was presented following his return from the Mexican-American War and of the bronze sword that was originally placed on the monument in 1904. I think you will agree with me that this is superb, stellar work. I certainly could not be happier. The next step is the bronzing!
