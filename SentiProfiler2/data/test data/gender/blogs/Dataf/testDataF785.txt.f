I didn't start watching AD until way after the show was over. Better late than never?! I don't know why or how I even began to watch this show, but I'm glad I did. After watching a few episodes online (probably Hulu), I immediately took myself to Target to purchase the seasons. I had always seen the DVDs at Target, just never really knew what it was about. Maybe that's why I started watching it, out of curiousity. This is hands down, one of my favorite shows.
