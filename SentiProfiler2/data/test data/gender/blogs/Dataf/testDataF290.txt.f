Today's menu: cheese lasagna, peas, pear, milk, bread, butter Wow. Truly monumentally bad. I couldn't get through the main entree. I was hungry too... I bit the cheese lasagna and it didn't even pass muster as pasta! Al dente? No, al crappy. The pasta couldn't hold its form and it crumbled. I ate two bites and I was done. Yuck. Luckily I keep peanut butter in my desk. I used the two pieces of bread that came with the lunch and made a peanut butter sandwich. The spork was my snife. I would have been so screwed without my little snack stash today. The pear and the peas were good. If it had been a fruit cup, I probably would have cried.
