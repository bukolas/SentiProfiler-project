Rather than a straight adaptation of Carroll’s stories, Woolverton has chosen to stage her story 13 years after the events in the books, which essentially makes this film a sequel of sorts; its closest cousin in this arena is another Disney-sanctioned reworking of classic children’s literature, Walter Murch’s Return to Oz (1985), an extremely dark and violent product of the Reagan era that has virtually nothing to do with Victor Fleming’s candy-colored musical. As Dorothy did in that film, Alice returns to Wonderland years later, only to find it enmeshed in conflict and alarm. Both films reunite their young heroines with an array of weird and endearing characters, and interestingly both also feature queens who are obsessed with decapitation (in Return to Oz, the evil queen keeps a closet of assorted heads to “wear,” whereas in Alice in Wonderland Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen just likes to cut them off).
