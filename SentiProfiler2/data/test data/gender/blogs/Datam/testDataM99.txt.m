3: This is going to be totally mine (my novel)(first person view)..so it can be a bit boring sometimes.

As Tilesh has requested several times to me to write story of our 3 yrs in Kota, so i m forced to write this.

Once upon a time, long long ago, I became 15 yrs old. My life became a bit interesting. My b'day comes on February, I was in 10th class, in 2003

We had a new principal. I think she hardly knew names of the students. I wasn't so popular student. It was the time of board exams. We had preparation leave. But I came to school to pick up my sister. I was out of the gate of school as they do not allow any student to enter the school campus after assembly gets over. I was arguing with guard at the gate outside, another guard came from inside, and told me principal ma'am is calling me. I thought i should have not argued with this guard. When I went inside principal's room ( first time after getting admission), the principal was smiling, she asked " you are Abhyuday naa", I replied "yes ma'am", and then she congratulated me, and told me that I got a maths olympiad certificate, 1st in Jabalpur region (32 schools comes under the region) and 36th in India. This is the first good thing happened to me AFTER 15.
Second, I dropped a girl(my sister's friend) in my bike from my home to her home, who was considered as the most beautiful girl in my school by my school friends. She is married now.
And so on, now coming to the main topic.
My father was very much impressed by his boss son who went to Kota for preparing engineering entrance examinations, who was 1yr senior to me. He wanted me to go to Kota for preparing for my future. He never told me to go to Kota, but I knew he want me to. Many of my senior from my school also went to Kota. I heard that they teach only maths and science(my favourite subjects), no social studies, hindi , enlish ,(i hated them). So deep in my heart I also wanted to go to Kota.
So after my board exams,and after watching the cricket worldcup (in which India came to final after 20 yrs), we (mom, dad sister and another family) went for south tourism. It was a one month tour. It was from SHIRDI, AURANGABAAD, HUMPI, B'LORE, MYSORE, MADURAI, KODAIKANAL, KANYAKUMARI, RAMESHWARAM, CHENNAI , TIRUPATI, NAGPUR, to SEONI. I had never gone outside M.P. before.
After long trip I forgot all the things about going to Kota and all. No one remembered about it then. After coming from the trip ,with my mom and sis, I went to my maternal grand parents, REWA. Things were changed after coming from the trip. There wasn't a single day when my mom and dad didn't have a quarrel, and those fights weren't small, they were horrible. I had never seen my mom and dad like that. In REWA(my grand parent's home) , there were 2 cousins of my age, Anand and Nandani, were in 10th class too. They got 84 and 80 % marks, nowhere comparison to me (64%). But I got good marks in my favorite subjects (96 in maths and 87 in science). They had begun to study for the 11th class.
I never told them my score, but my dad did, and they never mentioned it, so that I don't feel bad. They asked me what am I gonna do. I told them I m going to Kota. Anand asked me which institute? I was answerless. Never heard of it. I just heard that for preparing for EEEs many people have went to Kota, thats all. Then he told me there are 3 good institutes TCPP, RESTART, BACHELOR. among them BACHELOR is better, then RESTART and then TCPP.
My father called me and asked me that do I want to go to Kota, I already wanted to go, but now I was dying to, I don't wanna see their(mom's and dad's) fights. I thought , if I go , they'll not have time to fight. My father then asked me to get ready for it, as tomorrow I'll have to leave REWA. I wanted to go, but didn't want to leave so soon!!! So I intentionally slept for long, my grandfather guessed it woke me up, and send me to SHAHDOL(6 hrs journey from REWA by bus), with another guy just to drop off me. 6 hrs!!! just to drop off!!! I am considered as a small child. Still, now also, if I tell them that I travel alone for 2 days in a train, no one there would believe me.
From there my father took me to BHOPAL, he had some work there.We reached there in the morning 6 a.m. , after a long journey of 15 hrs. It was my sister's b'day. I wasn't ever away from her on her b'day. Father called her and wished her, then i did. We stayed, for the day, in my uncle's (mother's brother) home. Then we had waiting list reservation for BHOPAL to Kota train, that was late at night, 10 p.m. , waiting list never confirmed. I spent that night sitting. Morning 5 a.m. we reached there, Kota,what I imagined about kota was, there will be big desert, in which there will be just 4 or 5 houses in each square kilometers, it will be too hot. At least one thing I expected was correct, it was really very hot. At 9 a.m. we went to BACHELOR, one manager told that its too late, at 9 a.m. they are having entrance test. For engineering entrance examination we'll have to give entrance examination for this also?!! My father shown my 96 and 87 marks list. The manager told, "it'll now help you, go try somewhere else". Then with all mood off, we went to RESTART, there they told that they have exam today, at 2 p.m. . For writing exams we'll have to fill a form, for filling it we'll need to have passport size photos of me, so there should be some one who can give photos within an hour. we searched and got one. After filling form and having lunch I went to give exam, 3 hrs paper, after a 6hrs bus journey then a night train journey, then a night waiting list journey then this exam. I was really very exhausted. Anyways, while I was writing the exam, my father was exploring the Kota. After exam he took me to Chambal garden, best place in Kota, then he told me about the places I can go in Kota for a mood refreshment, if I have studied too much. Then by a train at night we came back, we never went to TCPP. Result was dated to come after 2 days.
We came back to SHAHDOL, and my mom came back from REWA, to pack up my luggage. After 2 days of rest in home,the time to go to Kota came, father called an autorikhshaw, I was sitting in it with full luggage, my mother came and gave me a water bottle, I saw her, she had 2-2 tears in each of her eyes, I said "mom", she suddenly went inside, pretending as if she didn't hear me. My dad also saw this, while in a way to Kota, he was , a type of, consoling me, "you are not going forever, you'll be back here within 2 yrs, your mom doesn't understand, but you do, I know you do, anyways you'll often visit us in vacations ."
4 yrs after this, my aunt (mom's sister) told me that when I went to Kota, for 3 days my mom did nothing, she didn't had lunch and dinner either, my sister cooked food for 3 days and served to my mom, but she didn't had. My mom ate food when my sister told her that, " if you are not having food then I'll also not have it ".
Anyways, coming back to Kota. I didn't get selected in RESTART, as I told you the exam I gave , was in fully exhausted mood. Father did the same thing, shown my 64% mark list, but it didn't work, again. But it worked in TCPP, they allowed me to join there institute just by purchasing their form. Someone told there that there is another good institute, better than TCPP, called NARNIA. My father was in dilemma, but I wasn't. Nobody in SHAHDOL or REWA knows this NARNIA, but they do know TCPP, let NARNIA be better than TCPP, but if I join TCPP , I'll have something to tell them, but if I join NARNIA I'll have nothing.
So at last I selected TCPP as a better carrier option, we went to TCPP's building to have admission, there I found Rahul.
rest in another post.
