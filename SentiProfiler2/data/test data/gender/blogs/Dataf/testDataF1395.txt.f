Dr. Mike examined me after I had been to 10 MDs. These 10 others couldn't diagnose my illness and didn't seem to care. Dr. Mike could tell there was something really wrong and didn't want to treat me, but gave me some great advice as far as treatment I should receive. I followed that advice and am now being treated by a tremendous and brilliant MD--one outside the system I had been in. I appreciate his care, concern, and professional advice. I'm doing much better now.
