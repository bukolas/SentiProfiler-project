Firstly,Surya as a father,yet another enthralling performance from his side.I can say,he has done complete justice to the role.His performance was upto the mark.The way he advices his son in various predicaments is awesome."JUST PURSUE WHAT YOUR HEART DESIRES"says it all.In short,a fantabulous performance. Secondly,Surya as a son,once again a cute,ebullient performance by Surya.The way he expresses his gratitude towards his father is really touching.I bet one cannot express his love as surya does.U could often see him being contemplative, in the story,which makes it even more appealing.In a nutshell,a stupendous performance. Thirdly,Simran,Surya's doting mother.Wht an enamouring voice??Needless to mention her versatility.The love she has on her husband and the affection she has on her son proves her versatility once again.She has really made her impact on the film.
