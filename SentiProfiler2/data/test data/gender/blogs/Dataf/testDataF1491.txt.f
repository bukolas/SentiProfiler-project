Eugh. The past two days, ive seen you twice. You know what, it still kills me. I attempt to talk to you now, and its like nothing. It's like we've never met. I can't believe it all stilled happened. I can't believe i fell for YOU. What an idiot ay ? We used to be so close. You'd lend me your jacket, walk me home, make sure i gave YOU a hug and you ran after me when i was upset and we sat and talked for hours. You made me feel so amazing. A feeling ive never felt before. You knew my family, maaaaan didn't they fucking love you. You made sure i was always safe, you took care of me when we out that night in that club, even after what happened at that party. Don't tell me you never felt anything for me, cus we both know that's a lie. I just can't believe after everything, our friendship means nothing to you anymore. I miss you. I NEED to get over you. In my own way i have. I've HAD to. I just can't believe you were to fucking scared to get it a chance. Just remember, if you're ever reading this, you told me once, you couldnt lose anymore people in your life, i understood you, you used to try so hard to make sure we never lost contact. You'd even make the time in your "busy" life to see me after school, and we'd sit in subway chatting about your hard times :/
I can't believe it came to this, we were so close, still could've been, probably would have made my life so much fucking easier. But no, you took the coward's way out, becus you were "too scared" well from now on. I'm never letting you in my life again. You had your chance. I love you. End of.
