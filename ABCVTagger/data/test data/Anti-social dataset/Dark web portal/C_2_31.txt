Salaam alaikoum wa rahmatullah wa barakatu Brothers and Sisters, here is the correction inch'Allah...please feel free to report any mistakes Do we have no curse for the cruel?! "Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wicked do. He but giveth them a respite till a day when eyes will stare (in terror)" [Imbrahim : 42] The occupying forces in Afghanistan had stated, the fact that they will bring the democracy to Afghanistan. The crusades, with the assertion, stimulated the people and were decorated to bring rescue, and are decorated for their cruelty and bloodbath. The occupying powers and their marsh to Afghanistan are taking revenge, "for the blows and the losses which they had to suffer from the hands of the Mujahidin", against the innocent people. The occupying powers have signed a new bloodbath in Afghanistan. They have bombed six innocent persons in the Lwora area in the province Paktia! The family Abdulbari Bulgari was terminated. This cruel operation was carried out by the army of the Nobel Prize of Peace. This shows that they have aimed under the flag of their "war against terror" to destroy the lifes of innocent people. We want to draw the attention of you to the secret arrangements of the Media in America controlled by Zionists, an arrangement has been done by overlooking the mass killing of innocent women and children committed by the Nazi NWO-Army!
