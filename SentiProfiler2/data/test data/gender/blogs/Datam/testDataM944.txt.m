For a consumer who needs 8mm/Hi8/digial 8 functionality, the TRV460 is an obvious choice. But for the consumer who is looking to venture into the MiniDV format (overall smaller camcorder/tape size), the GR-D33 might be a good stepping stone camcorder. The GR-D33 promises to have good video and low light performance, so the slight upgrade investment may be worth it. Making the transition has its pros and cons, the pros being, if you own an older Digital8 camcorder with a DV in/out port, you have the option of digitally copying your older tapes to the newer format.
