She is a very very sweet girl :)

Its hardly 2 months since I started talking to her. She is a fun loving girl. And she will make you smile :) Her smile is a most precious thing which she have. I always get inspired by way she overcome her stress.

Our IDS 506 gang just rocks!! We always meet to discuss about project but end up with guitar sessions or Marathi vocabulary or discussing about words like "Kote Rubber" or searching advertisements in you tube. In short, anything other than IDS 506 :D And what else you can except if Priya is around you!!

Keep Smiling Dear :) Hope you get everything in your life !!
