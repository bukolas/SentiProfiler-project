I did a lot of thinking about my business today. I got very close to taking the first step. I am not sure still. I think I need to finish this book I am trying to get through. It is basically about this kind of stuff, so I might learn something important. Jesus Christ! I thought I was just overreacting last time I complained about my parents watching movies to loud, because I have been watching my movies pretty loud too. But what the fuck. They are going to knock the fucking house down. Seriously, it is fucking 11:30pm and my brother is trying to sleep so he can wake up at 5 for school tomorrow. They have the volume way too loud.
