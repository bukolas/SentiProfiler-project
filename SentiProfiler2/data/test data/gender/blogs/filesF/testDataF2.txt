It's so hard to believe I am STILL writing about my trip to San Diego. It was over two weeks ago, people! Oh well. In between today and two weeks ago, I found myself completely overcome with a total lack of willpower of any sort, so I think it's kind of amazing that I even managed to get up in the morning these last few weeks. In case no one has ever said it, depression is totally debilitating, and it absolutely sucks.


Luckily I'm feeling much better now! And I'm ready to wrap up my recap of our trip to San Diego.


On Monday, Rob had to work, so Eric, Billy, and I directed ourselves to the beach, because west coast beaches are just WAY better than east coast beaches. It did not disappoint.


Rob reintroduced me to the idea of the "aerial" jump shot in photography, so we gave it a try. I like how I totally bogarted the whole frame. Because that is just how I roll!


After hitting the beach, we headed down to the San Diego Zoo. It was really fun. I'd been there years ago, but Billy and Eric had never been. I still like the Bronx Zoo better, but I will say the weather in San Diego was much better than the Bronx, at least while we were there, anyway.

I put together a short video montage of the zoo, if you feel like seeing pictures and videos of some really amazing animals.



And... that's it! We left for New York at about 4:30am on Tuesday morning and the rest is history. It was just what we needed, and it was great hanging out with the other half of the family. Can't wait to get back over there again. And I even got to check it off my list! This list is proving not to be the insurmountable mountain I thought it'd be, and it's actually keeping me focused on the good stuff in life. I totally need that, too.
it's been four nights here in Kawasaki, and i have to say, i am loving it. the feeling of being so far away from home, being so far away from everyting else. if only i don't have to wake up from this dream, and face the reality of life. if only all these could last a little longer, and perhaps i will be better.
snow. beautiful.white. that was exactly what i experienced the first night i was here. although this is not my first time walking in the snow, it never failed to impress me how beautiful, pure, and yet cold it is. i guess my emotional manisfestation have even brought forward the love of being in the snow. anyway, i was informed that it rarely snows here, and i was lucky to have experienced the second snowfall this season (in fact, there was a third snow fall last night, but it wasn't just as heavy as the first night. am now praying for more tonight).
shopping.eating.learning.culture. all these aspects have been mentioned so many times in my blog, and this is the first time where i really get to live the life. it is just so amazing to be in a place when there is so much happenings going on. what's more, being the adventurous person that i am, it is no surprise that i have discovered more charm in the city of kawasaki than the industrial estates. 
politics.friends.state.self : being on a same trip with one of the most seasoned politician of Penang has its pro and cons. in fact, i've come to learn of more things regarding politics, and also the thinking of the man behind one of the more important portfolios in Penang State Government. besides that, i've also managed to see a more down-to-earth human part for it, and probably did regain some of my trust to exercise my voting rights during the next election.
diva.impressions.celebrity: i guess the water did affect some of my thinking here (or maybe it is just too cold), but i did one of the most amazing things that i wouldn't have done it in penang..taking self portraits. i know, the first thing i expect would be labelled vain. but don't judge me yet. look at the pictures on FB, and then tell me what you think. as to impressions, i didn't know that my presentation have left such a huge impression amongst the participants in the forum. in fact, i have been approached several times today, with people asking me to take pictures with them. besides that, being congratulated over and over again, and also being the subject of admiration (as i was told by a friend of shenyang) did inflate my ego a little. i promise i won't let it get to my head, but do cut me some slack so that i can enjoy my moment of glory. it is not surprising that my presentation is flawless, as i do enjoy being there in front..hehe.on separate matters, i know my previous post sounded bleak, but whatthe heck.. haha. it reflects my thoughts, emotions and opinions. hahah. but then, i do know how to become a better person, and i will not let [Q] get into the way of being Ben.

I'm sitting here at home. Jake is playing a gig up in PC. Emmaus is asleep. I'm nervous to "start" anything for fear he may wake up. I know this is a normal feeling. It feels I'm a bit trapped in my own home. Don't get me wrong, I'm really enjoy this "Mom" thing. I feel needed/loved/blessed, and then some. It's just...different I guess is the word for it. I go back to work on Tuesday. Jake will be Mr. Mom or stay at home dad, or whatever you want to call it. 

I'm curious to see how my energy level is going to be while at work, and how sleeping and feedings will be when i have to be at work at 9am. I'm hoping that Emmaus will meld with my schedule as per when he's hungry. I know everything will work out, and I'm very grateful/greatful ( i never remember how to spell that silly word) that Jake gets to be at home with our son. I just want things to be the best they can be. I want our hospital bills to get paid off sooner than later. I want to buy some simple furniture so our house is comfy for us and guests. I want Jake to get the things he wants for his garden/yard. I want the pictures put up on the all in a way that I like and Jake doesn't feel that it looks "cluttered." I want time to visit friends and family and to fellowship with people over a meal. I hope people aren't put off because I have to stop and feed sometimes when we're playing games or hanging out. I want to travel to places near and far. 

God, I thank you for your provision as always. For the birth and health of Emmaus and Jake and myself. For the love of my family and friends near and far. I pray for peace and understanding knowing that you know the desires of my heart and that everything will be wonderful and we will enjoy this life to the fullest because we can and because you give us reason to live. Lord, you are my everything and thank you for ...everything. Amen.

I better sign off before he wakes up and needs a diaper change. smiles. and as always. thanks for reading.
With his crackpot denial that HIV causes AIDS, his appointment of a health minister who recommended beets and garlic garlic as treatment for South Africa's more than 5 million HIV infected citizens, his corrupt government, his incomprehensible support of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and his refusal to use South Africa's leverage to halt the horrors in Zimbabwe, former South African President Thabo Mbeki's legacy is a disgraceful one.

In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mbeki now heads an African Union panel set up in January 2009. It's composed of current and former African officials and it is tasked with helping to bring peace to war ravaged Darfur. It is also charged with investigating the atrocities committed in Darfur and advising the African Union on how to deal with perpetrators. They will issue a report of their findings in July. Today Mbeki announced that the panel will not consider any of the evidence compiled by the International Criminal Court.

On March 4 the ICC announced an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omer Al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, torture and the forced displacement of millions in the Darfur region of Sudan.
In just a few days, 2009-2010 school year officially ends! Yey!

Bea will be grade 6, Sam grade 4 and Vin will start preparatory. As i write this it just dawned on me that by next year (2011) Bea will be moving up to High School .. scary. Scary not because of the lessons she will be encountering but the fact that she is growing up too fast. Before i know it she will be entering College, like a thief in the night time will makes its entrance. I asked Bea what she wants to be ... she has many choice and has not really pegged a specific thing. Luckily, by the time she enters College there will be a lot of new opportunties, even online courses that are already a good choice to go will still improve and have more courses of specializations like health related careers, medical coding training courses, teaching courses (where Bea is also showing some interest in) and many more. This young generation will be showered with vast choices on where to go ... i always believed that one should follow thier hearst and not where the money is ... you must love what you do to succeed and excel in what ever you do.

I trust Bea to make the perfect choice for her when the time comes ... whatever it is we will support her all the way.
a long time coming? Spring! Luckily spring is in the air, blooms are all around and it has inspired me to finally finish this post! So, lets recap - Part 1 was about fun ways for all of us ladies to go green & stop contributing to the landfill. Part 2 was Charity for charity's sake & covered tons of opportunities we have to give back to our community without busting out our check books. So what's the topic of discussion today you ask? 

Making the world a lovelier place by any means necessary! Ready to get your hands dirty? Literally?Let me start off by admitting something... I have black thumbs. BUT this is something that I don't like about myself - that I CAN CHANGE! Do you have black thumbs too? Do things go from garden to graveyard in the blink of an eye? Lets make this change and grow together - pun intended! We all know that reading is the best way to learn about anything and I have to say that You Grow Girl by Gayla Trail has really opened my eyes as to where I've gone wrong in the past with my garden patches. You'll learn all about starting from seed, composting, irrigation, container gardens & more! She also has a new book that just came out - Grow Great Grub. I don't have a copy yet but you can bet your pretty pink garden shears that I'll be picking one up soon and you should too. If you are broke but ready to get growing check out her blog. 
Fun Fact: The National Gardening Association says that on average families can get up to a $500 return on their investment in gardening. For $500 me & my manfriend can spend a long weekend at the beach! Gardening here I come! 

So, maybe you want to see things spring up and grow.. but you don't have any dirt to dig in? Think again! Dirt is everywhere. Sure it may not belong to you but that doesn't mean it's off limits. Grow rogue! Look around your neighborhood. There are medians, patches of grass next to bus stops, unused space in local parks AND yes - vacant lots that are screaming for a little love & affection. There's plenty of fun and sneaky ways to spread that love. Get Fresh Cut put together this rad video that will teach you all about DIY seed bombing and inspire you to transform your neighborhood! 
*I will say that you may not want to plant veggies and herbs for consumption in these public places. You don't want to eat kale that was pee'd on by a drunk or fogged out by traffic exhaust. Just sayin'.. Okay - on with the show:


Did that get you all riled up and ready for more guerrilla style beautification tactics? Yes? Fantastic! Let's talk graffiti! No, don't bust out the Krylon just yet.. You will need a beer & a blender though for this most amazing and gorgeously green way to decorate your hood. Mossgraffiti! Okay, this won't work perfectly in all climates - including my own. Not a lot of moss here in Austin, TX... but that doesn't mean I won't give it a shot. You can create any image you like with moss and adhere it to any surface. All you need is: 
*1 can of beer
*1/2 teaspoon sugar
*Several clumps garden moss
*1 plastic container (with lid)
*a blender 
&
*a paintbrush
here again is lonely sunset
and that familiar emptiness growing
even as the light itself diminishes,
like touching hands through a screen door
knowing that departure comes next
even while wondering why

how I feel each time you slip
from the passenger seat
into the cool arms of the night,
cold metal and glass suddenly
a wall between me and you
and your brisk steps away from me,
the last look over your shoulder
before you disappear behind the corner

some kind of ship that sinks nightly
drowning the tiny clutching hands
of my attachments,
spilling their contents into the sea
of darkening night,
longing and desire set adrift,
flotsam on the currents of passing time

another day has slipped like water
through my fingers
and I have nothing to show
for the air and water and
sunlight consumed,
nothing but these aging hairs
upon my head imperceptibly
marking time
and this calendar of heartbeats
I cannot read

what will I do with the sunlight
if given again tomorrow?

when will I be infinitely aware
that every moment, each exhaled breath
is sunset?
and every next moment,
each new rising of my chest
an un-promised sunrise?

when will I unflinchingly see
that time passes at the speed of light,
and yet any moment, cupped
like precious water in my hands,
holds infinitely still?
Oh how I love this boy! Gordon is such a sweet boy. This morning when we were eating breakfast I told them that there was no fighting on Valentine's Day, only loving and kissing. Gordon immediately got off his chair and started kissing my arm. He is my little snuggle bug. Not a day goes by when he doesn't curl up on my lap and snuggle with me.

If anyone comes to our house, Gordon will undoubtedly give them a hug. He likes to play house and is always the baby because "the baby gets to be held and rocked and loved". (I think it might also have something to do with the fact that babies don't really do anything.)

Gordon has recently started reading and is so enthralled in letters. He likes to sound out words and his favorite word to spell is "pop". We were talking about the nice things we could do for the others in our family and Gordon whispered to me, "Can I give them pop?" I told him it would be fine and now we are all finding little papers with "pop" written on them from Gordon. I love finding those papers!

We recently registered Gordon for Kindergarten. I know he is excited to go and I am sure he will be just fine. I also notice how different he is from the other boys his age. While they all want to play Star Wars or Batman, Gordon is happy to talk about Winnie the Pooh or play house and be the baby. 

Hopefully the law isn't so strict that my "Touch Love Language" little boy can get a few hugs from his teacher. If not, I will be handing them out before and after school.
A large number of today's cellphones are now equipped with GPS capabilities. Perhaps users disdain the idea of carrying a lot of gadgets so having GPS in a mobile phone makes sense.
Service providers and carriers have recognized the demand for Global Positioning Systems in handsets and a currently offering the service to a number of consumers. Let's look at the AT&T cell phone GPS which provides one of the most reliable services in the country.
It's obvious that AT&T has a solid strategy on providing location based services to its clients. The carrier has also recently launched the Garmin G60 Nuvifone, a Global Positioning System based handset.
Let's get into the meat of AT&T cell phone GPS.The carrier offers two GPS services. The Navigator provides real-time turn-by-turn navigation on Smartphone or static navigation and Local Search on phones with no GPS capabilities. The Navigator Global Edition on the other hand offers mapping and Point of Interest content for three continents, including North America (U.S., Canada, and Mexico), Western Europe, and China.Other aspects of the AT&T cell phone GPS include:
field force management asset tracking
field service automationproductivity tools like GPS timecards and wireless forms
The wireless service provider also offers the FamilyMap which offers peace of mind by allowing parents to conveniently locate a family member's wireless phone on a map from a mobile phone or PC. Other applications and location based services offered by AT&T include:
MapQuest Navigator AAA Mobile
Loopt Where
Slifter GeoCache Navigator
CaddyHawk Allsport GPS
That's it for this post on the Global Positioning System based services offered by AT&T. Tune in to this blog to get more useful information on everything wireless.
You all know how I feel about saving money! I really LOVE it! It's my "thing"! But, this week, I was feeling pretty cranky about the whole coupon thing. I hadn't been to the store in a few weeks, so it was taking a lot of time and brain cells to get this week's preparations done. Last night, I just quit and went to bed because my brain wasn't functioning and just couldn't organize anymore. This morning, I got up at 5 and finished, still not looking forward to whole shopping experience.

You see, for the sales this week, they would take $5 off for every 10 of the special sale items you purchase, meaning that I had to keep track of everything while I shopped. It is a real headache sometimes. Today was no exception.

I got to the store early, (to beat the snowbirds) and started in on it. About 1/2 way through my shopping, my pen (that I was keeping my 10 item tally with) ran out of ink. Did I have another pen in my purse? No. I was SO bugged! There was no amount of sucking or shaking that would make my pen write. Grrrr.. So I headed off to the office supply aisle to begrudgingly buy a pen.

Standing there in front of the pens were 2 men having a indepth discussion about pens. So, I reached around them, grabbed a "sale" pen and started to head off. One of the men asked if I wouldn't mind helping his friend find a pen. That's when I noticed that one of the men was very mentally handicapped, and he was helping his blind friend try to find pens. The blind man said he wanted a "Bic" pen, so I told him about a few there, then grabbed a bag of the "bulk" pens from the bottom, which were what he was looking for. They were SO happy to get the pens! They thanked me over and over!
A more enduring battle than Me vs. Job Market has been Me vs. My Hair.

Since I was four (I blame Florida water), I've had this mass of rebellious corkscrews on my head. And not the soft, bouncy Shirly Temple type, or the funky Lauryn Hill coiffe, but a frizzy mop that defies the blow dryer, good weather and any Japanese straightening system that wages war against genetics.

When I was eight, I attempted to de-volumize and had it all chopped off to a couple of inches. The end result was a full on square-shaped 'fro that earned me nicknames like Don King, and plenty of bawling sessions in the lower bunk bed. Then when I was 12 I discovered a straightener and have since spent hours with 430 degrees applied to my scalp for parties, interviews, or any time I needed to feel, yes I am saying it, empowered.

At age 13, an age when you will do anything that will make you look like everyone else, I succumbed to a $500 burning ointment that changed the chemistry of my locks, and continued to shell out atrocious amounts for just a few months of normalcy over the next eight years.

But things change. I went through a couple more battles with Self, and then to college, where I watched this one guy in the Plaza of the Americas hang out in the grass with incredibly tangled and mangled blonde hair, sticking up and coagulating into dreadlocks and probably washed less than my car.

And I met Lynsey, whose own hair liberation inspired me to question why I was constantly suppressing, straightening, stressing out what was rightfully my version of beauty. She called it "going natural", and while I touted going natural in all other aspects, I never considered how vital it could be for my hair.

Fast forward to last weekend when I sat in the chair at the hairdressers. Every hairdresser except for one (who quit) tells me to straighten and relax my hair. Last Saturday was no different and I started my usual apologetic shpiel for the difficult situation I had burdened my stylist with.

On her third insistence that I pay her hundreds to relax my hair, I got straight up angry. With a smile still on my face I said, "I like my hair. I like it curly and I don't want to straighten it." So she made a face, she shrugged, she kept cutting. At the end, she said, "I'm glad you like your hair."

Sometimes I read articles about how straight hair is taken more seriously and how to buy the perfect straightening iron. And it's true that the click-clack of heels and a shiny blow-out helps me face an employer or potential date with more confidence. But on just any day, like a misty March Sunday, I've got my hair down and free and in absolute defiance of any glossy ad, and I'm reveling. Isn't that what it means to grow up?
For some reason I keep having dreams that someone breaks into my home and kidnaps Gage. I guess it's just my worst fear with all of the crazy people in this world. Then this morning I thought my worst fear had come true. Here's what happened ...

Last week I had a photographer come to the house to take some pictures of Gage. I figured that would be a great Christmas present for the 4 sets of grandparents that Gage has. The girl came to the house and was really nice but came off like she might have been on something. After that night I started having bad dreams about someone breaking into the house and taking him. Then last night she came back to deliver the CD with all of the pictures. Only she brought her husband with her. They walked into the house and I caught a really odd vibe from her husband. First off he is a tattoo artist and I am sure a very nice guy but he had tattoo's on his face and they were alittle freaky. He didn't crack a single smile, although I am sure he was uncomfortable being in a strangers house. He hovered over her very closely as we stood over the computer looking at the prints. She kept asking to see Gage who was comfortably relaxing in his bouncer chair in the living room. So I brought her over to see him. She asked to hold him and I obliged then she walked over to her husband saying isn't he the cutest baby ever, he's my little buddy. I thought it was cute but this guy still didn't crack any sort of smile. He just looked angry/evil. Shortly after that they left. We locked up the house and went back to our normal routine put Gage to bed and then we went to sleep. Patrick and I have been switching off every other morning on getting up with Gage for his feeding. The routine is Gage usually wakes up between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. eats a bottle and then goes back to bed in his bouncer. He would go back to bed in his crib but his window faces east so the sun shines in his window and since the window is over sized we had to custom order a black out curtain and well it's not here yet. So when we put him down after his feeding he goes into his bouncer and sleeps in the living room so that Patrick's snoring doesn't wake him. As a courtesy to each other on the mornings I get up with Gage I turn the baby monitor off so that Gage's crying doesn't wake Pat up and Patrick does the same on his mornings. So anyway back to the point I wake up from my bad dream at about 10 to 6, completely shaken I look at the clock and look at the monitor. Why don't I hear the baby snoring I run to Gage's room and look down into the crib. He's not there! My reaction ..... scream bloody murder! Patrick jumps out of bed to see whats going on. At this point I'm on the floor crying and screaming he's gone. Amy he's in the bouncer. I'm sobbing so uncontrollably I don't hear what Patrick is saying so he picks Gage up and brings him to me. I sat on the floor for what felt like and eternity clinging to Gage so happy to see him. I guess he woke up around 4 a.m. and Patrick heard him chewing on his hand so he got up to check on him and decided to feed him and put him in his bouncer. In an attempt not to wake me since I have been sleeping so bad from those dreams. It never even occurred to me that he might have already been in his bouncer I am just so use to waking up to his cries when I didn't hear them I immediately thought the worst. Then seeing the monitor on it just didn't register that he might have already been up. After all calmed down I asked Pat why he didn't turn the monitor off and he admitted that the girls husband scared him alittle as well and he wanted to make sure he could hear on the other side of the house.
Something happening to Gage is my worst fear. If anything ever happened to him, I just don't know what I would do with myself. He's my world! Sometimes when I watch the news and see yet another child has been kidnapped, I catch myself saying "Thank god that isn't my child". My heart just sinks for those families who have had someone kidnap there child. Dreaming about it is bad enough, I just truly couldn't imagine living out that nightmare.
After I participated in a rousing SXSW panel about content recommendations, Emmanuel Marchal, general manager of London-based LikeCube approached me in the hall to tell me about his company. I thought it was pretty cool, so I captured a video interview with him right there.

LikeCube was co-founded by a semantic web technologist and an anthropologist four years ago, and funded by the UK’s National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts. It combines metadata, user activity and personalization to help clients recommend locations on a per-user basis (watch the video for more specifics). The service works around the idea that the wisdom of the crowds is too general to make recommendations for everyone. Of course nobody would disagree with that idea when it comes to music or movies, but the principle probably applies to restaurants and hotels too.

The company powers recommendations for Qype, which is a European version of Yelp, and is working to secure other such deals in categories such as travel. LikeCube charges a licensing fee and also splits revenue with its white-label clients.

Marchal pointed out that on TripAdvisor, the single worst dirty U.S. hotel is a place in San Francisco. If you check out the hotel’s reviews, 80 percent of reviewers said they wouldn’t recommend it to a friend, which necessarily means that 20 percent of reviewers would recommend it. Perhaps those folks just aren’t very kind to their friends, but Marchal’s point is that people’s tastes differ; for some, this hotel would be the right value for the price.
blocks from our hotel. We didn't see turtles -- although the lifeguard says she's sometimes seen them there -- but we saw lots and lots of lots of fish: big fish, small fish, pale fish, bright fish, and one absolutely gorgeous yellow and orange and turquoise fish that's about the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but that I can't find on the fish ID card Snorkel Bob's gave us.

Gary said, "This is like swimming in an aquarium." Also, we got there early enough that for the first hour or so, we were the only people in the water. Amazing!

There were a few minor mishaps. I swam out pretty far, to the spot where the lifeguard said she'd seen turtles, and wound up being pulled several beaches down by a strong current. (Respect Mother Ocean!) And both of us got some scrapes and bruises, from coral and rocks, getting back into shore, as careful as we tried to be not to touch or damage anything. But now we know the best entrance and egress point, and also know not to swim out too far, so that's all very useful info.

Gary loves this as much as I do, which is great. He's the hiker in the family, and I'm the swimmer: I can't keep up with him when he hikes, and he finds most swimming venues too cold, and has no interest in swimming laps. But we've finally found a sport we can share. Yay! 

We're now thinking of buying our own snorkel equipment -- the snorkels and Gary's mask, anyway; fins are heavy to transport and inexpensive to rent -- and of planning more snorkel vacations in the future. Yay, snorkeling!
hello. my name is sarah. i used to be a cheerleader. i'm depressed.

in high school cheerleading was AMAZING. it was so much fun. it gave me most of the friends i have today. our coach SUCKED every year, well it was the same lady, but because of her we pretty much sucked every year. we got basically last at competition all the time. but we still had so much fun, i still got to compete which is a rush nothing else can ever equal. we did cool stuff like wore our uniforms on game days and had bake sales and decorated together and dressed up for homecoming. and although we never really "went anywhere" as in doing well at competition and stuff i still loved it. cheerleading was like my high school life. it was fun, even when practices sucked and people cried and i got bloody noses. it was fun because the people i did it with made it fun and we tried our best and it was good.

in college i thought i would try cheerleading since i liked it so much in high school. but the tryouts were during the summer and i couldn't make them. i thought oh well, it wasn't meant to be. in september i saw a huge sign for cheerleading tryouts, it was so amazing so i went to them. turns out they didn't have enough people from the summer and needed a bigger team. so i tried out, but i became the alternate. the coach assured me i would not be left out and i would definately have a place on the team and be able to compete if someone got hurt or something happened. i was disappointed but decided it would be ok and i would do it. practices began. they sucked. they were soooo long and sooo boring and i didn't get to do much because i was an alternate....coach lied a bit. the team was pretty much all cliquey already and i just didn't fit in. it wasn't like high school at all where every year when new people joined the team we accepted them and eventually we became a big family. they just wouldn't let me in and so i was always shy and didn't get to come out of my shell and be the crazy person i really am which is why everyone loves me. time passed and i hated cheerleading more and more, not the actual sport but just doing it at keene state. then one night someone fell on me and i sprained my ankle. after that i couldn't do anything. i just sat there. i had to come back from winter break like a week early to practice but i still couldn't do much. it was ridiculous. and then one day when we were about to leave for an away game the coach told me i was no longer on the team (in so many words) i cried a lot but i was also pretty happy since i hated it so much.

today i look back on these two worlds with sadness. unlike the people younger then me in high school who got to have a new coach and really make something of themselves those last two years of highschool i got nothing and have only the happy memories but no fulfilling cheerleading career to look back in. in college i am like a black sheep of the team. everyone pretty much thinks i'm a slacker and they dislike me. the coach obviously dislikes me since she kicked me off the team. so i could never go back to them and even if i wanted to i doubt i would make the team. 

i lost my train of thought and i'm still sad so i'm gonna go now. i'm glad i got all that out. don't know how much it helped however. i think i'm gonna go buy a cheerlading handbook.
Happy March! What have you all been up to? I hope you're all doing dandy fine and groovyliciously.
I've been watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit. What a phenomenal film. I like it much more immensely than, say...Avatar.
*dodges rotten tomatoes*I saw WFRR back in the day and was pretty impressed; now I'm going to add charmed, riveted, transfixed and awed to the list of adjectives. I'm watching in installments, tonight will be the third and I think I'll bring along my sketchbook. I've also been reading Joann Sfar and Emmanuel Guibert's graphic novel, The Professor's Daughter. I spotted it on the shelf at the library who knows how. One glance through and I was enchanted and totally jazzed by the fluid, expressive lines of Guibert's sepia inks. Totally amazing. I'm going to buy this for my permanent collection (I don't buy many books due to budgetary constraints but this is definitely worth an exception).So today while I was in the waiting room at the clinic, I sketched from the book and had a really great time. He is such an inspiration. The storywriting is superb, funny, and as engaging as the panels.
Well, I read baseball news.

I figured the key to running without thinking about time, or how tired I am, or the distance. READING! I forgot my iPod today (it is in my coat pocket and it is too warm for a coat today), so I stationed myself in front of the ESPN TV because it has closed captioning. Today was all about baseball. No word on the Cardinals or the Indians, but I think that might have been in the next half hour I was lifting weights.

I did not run yesterday for a number of reasons - most importantly the way my schedule lined itself out yesterday did not give me the time in between obligations. So I put it off to today, the day I opted to take off in my schedule. That's OK, I think it actually made for a better run today.

Run Distance: 3 miles
Run Time: 32:45
Other Activity: Arm weights (least favorite)
Feeling: I don't remember
Soundtrack: The gym

I think I'm going to start bringing some reading for my runs. A way to keep up on my reading for class and a way to pass the time.
Classmates.com — the website that promises to reunite people with their mullet-haired friends of youth — has agreed to pay out a $9.5 million settlement for a lawsuit dating back to 2008 accusing the company of “false advertising” through “deceptive” marketing emails.

The problems for Classmate.com began back in late 2007, when San Diego resident Anthony Michaels received an email from the social networking company informing him that his old classmates were trying to contact him.

In order to see who and why, Michaels had to upgrade to a “Gold Membership.” However, upon forking out to do so, he discovered that nobody was trying to get in touch; it was just a dubious marketing ploy from Classmates.com.

Michaels initiated a false advertising lawsuit against Classmates.com, which became a class action suit that anyone who suffered the same fate as the plaintiff could sign up for.

Fast forward to today: although Classmates.com has admitted no wrongdoing as part of the proposed settlement now waiting for U.S. District Court approval, it has agreed to pay out $3 for every Classmates.com member who upgraded to a “Gold Membership” on the site after receiving an email like Michaels’ — estimated to be just over 3 million people.

Whether or not you sympathize with those that fell for Classmate.com’s oh-so-obvious tactics, it’s an interesting case in terms of wider web marketing. Dating sites are known to carry out similar practices, and this settlement may make offenders sit up and take note.

While this particular case may be settled, it’s not the end of Classmates.com’s legal troubles. The site is facing another lawsuit filed just this month, this time a class action privacy lawsuit that accuses Classmates.com of ignoring federal and state privacy laws by making user profiles public via a controversial opt-out scheme.
I have agreed to take part in.
The Round Robin starts today.
This month:-
1. you have to make a piece of fabric, a fat 1/4 in size.  You can stamp, dye, print etc.  You all have a theme to work to, and you can use architecture, culture, clothes etc as your design source.
2.  Your fabric must to be passed onto the next  person BY the 31st March, with your design source/image to show that person where your ideas are coming from.
Using the random number generator this is what you have got-
1)  Nickie-Europe
2) Margaret-Asia
3) Di-Australasia
4) Deb-Africa
5) Sharne-America's
I will email you all on March 22nd with info on who to pass your fabric onto.
Please post photo's on your blog of what you are doing with the challenge.
 
So now I seriously need to get my thinking hat on. It's been a while since I did any design work of any description and I felt that I should challenge myself again.
Also have the Chairmans challenge at Ferrers Quilters to think about. This is to make a miniature quilt any style any technique. A miniature is not something that I have attempted before so again a challenge for me.
Also have a stall at a Tattoo convention at the end of the month and need to produce some stock for that.
Phew!
On top of all this I have a new role at work and this is another new challenge.
I am still enjoying the belly dancing immensely and have (hopefully) booked tickets for an all day event which will include me doing 3 workshops. Very scary as I am a complete beginner.One of them is on American Tribal Style which is a form of belly dancing that I really like and may want to continue with.Although the event is in Andover the tutor for this ATS is local so it would not be too hard to get to classes.
So, for me, quite enough on my plate at the moment
Shown here in Offerings to Horus are more items to be offered to the gods such as were found in the tombs of the deceased. Some of these offering lists describe many kinds of breads and cakes and one in particular called, shat-cake, is very interesting. This cake was an unusual isosceles triangle shape and because of its height had to be laid on its side, creating heads and tails in a pile. In a tomb from the 18th dynasty an entire kitchen scene depicts shat-cakes being made, date flour being sifted, and others frying and stacking the cakes. Grapes were common since antiquity but peaches were not introduced to Egypt until the Ptolemaic period.Any offering to Horus would have been of great importance because he played a crucial role in the life of the pharaoh. Fruits, meats, cakes, wines, and many other varieties of foods would have been on the lists. Other items were jewelry, coins, art objects, and precious metals, each an offering to ensure everlasting life.
This painting was done on a wood panel which will create a different appearance from linen. Because of the hard texture-less surface the paint sits on the surface and creates splendid impasto.
I'm not sure how I feel about this. The 17-year-old author of a white-hot novel in Germany has admitted to lifting large parts of other works and inserting them into hers. She claims it's remixing rather than plagiarism. From the NYT article:

“There’s no such thing as originality anyway, just authenticity,” said Ms. Hegemann in a statement released by her publisher after the scandal broke.

Are we looking at a future with the loss of the self? 

Scholarship is not only about recognizing and crediting one's sources. More than that, it's about finding relationships with texts, through those texts relationships with other writers and thinkers, and one's place in the dialogue around a topic. So if it's remixing, if we don't have to acknowledge outside sources, and if no one has to acknowledge us, then there are no relationships and no identity within the dialogue. As writers and thinkers, we would be submerged. So are we looking at a future with the loss of the self?
Last week the DesignHER Momma household was in survival mode. Michael was in Europe for over a week and the kids and I were left to "fend" if you know what I mean. No grand-parental support was available for reinforcement; it was just the kids and I for 7 looooooong days.

I didn't blog about it at the time, because, you know, nothing spells I.D.I.O.T. more than declaring to the interweb that I'm home alone. I'm nobody's fool, yo.

I realized a few things while my husband was gone:

I don't know how single mom's do it. Let me say it again: I don't know how single moms do it. If you are one of them, I get on my knees and give you a big Waynes World "I'm not worthy."

I have the best friends in the world. A few of you totally bailed me out when I was at my craziest. I own you one (or ten).

Your body will really start to feel link junk after consecutive meals of alternating between chicken nuggets and frozen pizzas (accompanied by Diet Coke of course)

I actually really like having my husband around. No, not just to help out with the kids, but to hang out with. He's a pretty fun guy and I love him a lot. awwwwwe....

And lastly, but probably the most important, I realized that my kids are pretty awesome and they deserve an equally awesome mom.

Right now, that mom is not me. I've finally made "the appointment" (you know, the one to fix the crazy). This is probably an appointment that is YEARS! overdue. I'll admit that I'm scared, excited, and really anxious about it.

And while I detest it when my husband leaves, he has always come back. (Which sometimes, I wouldn't blame him if he ran for the hills and never looked back). This time - he came back with ugly ammounts of Swiss chocolate.
We had a terrible, TERRIBLE storm here over the weekend. We lost power for most of Saturday night, but many people in the area are still without power, there's awful flooding, and the skies have continued to be gray and rainy.

Yuck.

I took the girls to Target today (where else?) just to get them out for awhile, as we are all going a bit stir crazy. On the ride there (which took twice as long as usual due to closed roads and flooding) we listened to our Yo Gabba Gabba cd. About 12 times.

Jack's song (Bedtime Lullaby) came on and the following conversation ensued....

Katie: Jack's song!
LaLa: Yay, Jack's song! Night night baby Jack!
Katie: No, wake up! Wake up Jack!
Me: Baby Jack isnt really asleep Katie. He's up in heaven, remember? Up in the sky!
LaLa: with the sun!
Me: Right! Jack is up in heaven, with the sun and the moon and the stars. He's up there watching over you.

Both girls stare intently for awhile out the window, up at the dark gray sky.

Finally, Charlotte yells:
"Jump!"

Me: What did you say Lala?
LaLa: Jump, baby Jack! Jump!
Katie: Yes, jump Jack! Jump!

The two of them stared expectantly out the car window for awhile, yelling JUMP! Fully expecting to see Jack come jumping down out of the clouds.

That was my little bit of sunshine today.
I call this colleciton "Polar Bear in a Snowstorm", LOL I've been picking up canvases ForEVER, so I sat and sealed them all with gesso. There's big ones that are a project for my living room, down to teeny tiny ones with little easels. Can't wait to work on them!

If unlike me, you NEED supplies, check out the Esty Supply Street Team (team esst) We have a total of over 25k great supplies, so whatever you need, we are sure to have it! I am having a special in my supply shop, INeedThat...Free shipping with purchases over $25! Its supposed to end at Midnight Sunday, but if you see something, go ahead and place the order, and just put in the comments that you saw the deal on my blog, and I will extend it for you!

Well, what else? I really need to get things out of the studio, so I have listed several things on ebay. You can see the link on the right side here, under "where you can find me", so take a peek there, and see if there's anything you need listed. Bids welcome!

Back to work...have that cutting board and the star boxes sitting here waiting for their final touches!
I have been a busy, busy girl!
I am finished with Magic hour! (OK still have to sew the back together but that doesn't count!)
And have moved on to Adams Black, White and Red quilt, I have it done except the boarders, and I have almost finished the two extra quilts from the left overs, I will get them done this weekend and posted since I have a three day weekend I am pretty sure I will have time to get all three finished!

I have also been busy searching for a car for Torrie. Stuart has been working on a 72 bug for her to drive, but sadly has not made a lot of progress on it and it will not be drivable for a long while. So I made the command decision to use some of my savings and buy her a car...oh what a long strange trip this has been!!! I spent several days looking on craigslist for something in my budget and something that will be safe and reliable... well let me tell you, those three things just DO NOT go together!!!!
I looked at one car that.... well lets just say, the pictures were wonderful (just love photo shop!) But when we actually saw the car, well side swiped, spray painted, water leaks oh and my personal favorite, they had MELTED the air bag cover back in place, of course no air bag because it had deployed when the car got hit!!! OMG.

So, after that lovely little car I decided it was time to start calling dealerships, now I know that the chances of finding something in my price range is almost zero, but it never hurts to call.

My first call, I get put on with this nice salesman named Rick, I explain to Rick that I have $XXX amount of money, not financing anything, something safe for a teenage girl.... you get the idea, well as we are talking Rick says to me... "Do I know you?" Me.. "no" he says "you sound really familiar" ...Oh I say... then he asks if I quilt.... now let me tell you, I work from home and do NOT know a lot of people especially men... so when a strange mans says he knows you, AND know you are a quilter the will FREAK you out! Anyhow, he then pauses and say...Wendi! I say..RICK... Turns out that I had completely forgotten that my good friend Wendi's (maker of the Cars quilt a couple of posts down) husband is a sales man, and low and behold but that was who I got put on with... well, long long story short, Rick was a wonderful help, I ask him to please find a car that he would buy for HIS teenage daughter (yes he has one too) and he did. I did cost more than I had planned on spending...(I will NOT be putting a fence up this year after all) But I got an excellent car for Torrie... So with out further ado... Torrie's new "Grandma Car"
Well nearly a year has passed..which makes me another year older, but I won’t dwell on that. Daren't.

In a lot of ways nothing has changed, life has trundled on as it has a habit of doing, but I suppose the changes were just gradual and with me not writing about them, I simply didn’t notice.

And writing is something I miss. If I had the time I like to think I’d still be writing, but I suppose I do have the time, just that other things are more appealing at the given moment...

I’m no longer working. I gave it up about a month ago. Maybe longer, I’m not sure as I’m not counting – which is bliss! Some of my friends thought I might get bored being a full time mom again, but I’ve never been the type of person who can’t find something to do!

So my days are now filled with cleaning, and painting the house. And a bit of that online game I mentioned last year, possibly even a ‘bit’ too much. But we each find ways of escaping, and that’s mine.

On the family front, the eldest lad R, is off to America this Christmas, on his own, to see his ex- girlfriend. And yes that’s a tale all of its own I may cover sometime...

The second son P, has started secondary school, is in the top group, and is getting As (who would have thought it possible?? Long may it last...) He re-sat the entrance exam to the other school he still wants to go to last Saturday, and –yet again- we sit here waiting to find out if he passed. And then, whether there will be a place for him

Eldest daughter J, is as beautiful as ever, still as confident and popular as ever, and I still wonder where she gets it from, cause it sure ain’t me!

And the youngest daughter S...well, heaven help us all, she’s a law unto herself. She doesn’t give a fig for school, other than it’s handy for socialising; always looked like she got dressed in the dark; and still sounds like a 3 year old with her high pitched squeaky voice (my mother says wants her to have elocution lessons ;))

Which brings us back to me. I gave up smoking at the start of the year. But I took up drinking instead – which frankly did nothing for me! Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean I turned into a demon when tipsy, in fact the kids adored me drinking as they said I was so much nicer....but I put on some weight. More than when I was pregnant! And I never stopped missing the cigarettes. So a couple of weeks ago, I swapped back. Now I smoke, and again don’t drink. I prefer it like this. And the weight is coming off fast :)

There really isn’t a lot more going on in my life these days. Oh..I’ve taken over the running of the school uniform shop – but that’s hardly great gossip or intriguing tales for here.

But who knows, maybe something interesting or funny will happen tomorrow...^^
My heroes - The Lone Ranger and Tonto and Jack (not necessarily in that order!)
When I come home after a Bad Day at Black Rock - I open the door and hear the William Tell Overture blasting away in full volume from our stereo. Jack just knows when to play it for me.
The Lone Ranger and Tonto have been my heroes for as long as I can remember. I love them.
For my 30th birthday, I decided I was worth some awesome gifts. I never asked for anything from Jack, and back then I didn't receive a H--- of a lot either, so I put down my "demands" with a note saying I was worth every single thing on my list!
My list went something like this: an art book, some art pencils, a silver wedding band because I am so not a gold/diamonds kinda gal and lastly, I wanted to meet the Lone Ranger!
Well, I got everything on my list except Clayton Moore. I was one very happy camper because the latter item was just for fun!
Then one day, Jack says, "I need to go pick up something from a buddy, do you want to go along with me?"
I said sure and away we went. We pulled up in front of a townhouse and as we entered the gate, out came .... I am serious here... The Lone Ranger --- Clayton Moore in person... mask and all!!!
(Be still my heart!)
Jack really came through. (40 years later, I can say "again, and again, and again he comes through for me!!!)
SooooOOOooo ... long story short : I was absolutely spellbound.
(So why am I telling you this now? Because he is playing the William Tell Overture for me right this very moment..... gotta love this man of mine!)
happy monday!  well off to the new week and of course that means  new stuff from  BBTB2 YAY YAY! heather's doing such  a great job with BBTB  dont ya think :)  be sure to stop by and play along with us  its not only fun for the DT to see what each other comes up with for the week but also to see what you can do for us :)

hoping your week starts off good :) XXXshelly
I ran 7 miles on Saturday. It felt good! I was strong, had good form and it wasn't as dreadful as I thought it would have been. I attempted 3 miles yesterday but I could tell that my body needed some rest so I ran a mile and walked a mile. Today is a rest day and I can tell my body needs it. It feels good to relax some, perhaps I'll actually get some scrapbooking or cleaning done.

Work is OK, we're moving locations. I knew this was coming just not so fast. I'm helping with seating arrangements and everyone and their uncle has to put their 2 cents in. Just be happy you have a desk to sit at!!! Then there's Miss Nosey pants co-worker who needs to know everything....Um I don't need your help with this so step back.

Passports came on Saturday so that's exciting....Germany here we come. Now only if flight prices would come down I'd be a happy girl.

Guess that's all, not much to say for a Monday morning.
A brief reconstruction of the event in question (partially for your information, but more for my memory):

Monday, January 11th: went into early labor on my own.
3pm: reported for pre-scheduled doctor's appt. She decided to let me go home and get some rest, and fully expected me to end up in the hospital prior to the 5am induction time.
Evening: actually slept through contractions, thanks to some good drugs :)

Tuesday, January 12th
5am: reported for scheduled induction. 4 cm dilated but with an irregular contraction pattern, so pitocin was started.
8am(ish): epidural started.
8:15am: Left side numb. Right side totally normal. Epidural redosed.
8:30am: Totally numb with a blood pressure of 64/48. A few shots later, I was coherent again and had a more appropriate blood pressure.
8:30am - 3:45pm: Repeat. Got an epidural redose at some point with another corresponding drop in blood pressure. Blood pressure also dropped every time they had me change position. Learned the warning signs so that I could tip the nurses off before it got too low. Contractions did their job so by 3:45, I was almost 10cm dilated.
3:45pm: Epidural starting to wear off a bit. Didn't want a redose (nor did the doc want to do it) because I was so close to pushing; plus, I didn't want to be passing out while trying to push, given my track record.
4pm: 10cm dilated, got the OK to push. Baby at 0 station.
4pm-6pm: Pushing. A lot. Eventually they gave me a good drug in my IV to curb the nausea and vomiting (always a challenge when trying to push at the same time!).
5:55pm: Baby still at 0 station. PA confirmed for my OB that the baby had not moved at all since I began pushing 2 hours earlier. OB said "We only let people push for 3 hours if there is no progress being made. You can push for another hour but I really think we're going to end up doing a c-section regardless." Me: "Well, let's do it now then". OB was also concerned that the baby could be much larger than we expected.
6pm: Epidural wore off completely. Got to experience the joy of having severe contractions less than 30 seconds apart while not being allowed to push and with no pain relief while the anesthesiologist finished an epidural on another patient. Matt and my mom were provided with surgical attire and packed room in a mad dash. And then we waited.
6:25pm: Anesthesiologist finally arrives. Pain medication administered. Able to catch breath.
6:30pm: arrived in OR.
6:40pm: Joshua William was born :) He came out grabbing onto the surgeon's tools...and they couldn't get him to let go! Turned out that he was face up, which was why he wasn't able to descend (and was only 7lbs 9oz, so not huge after all!). My OB said I almost certainly would have ended up with a c-section regardless.

Due to some severe shoulder pain from the c-section (something about air in my abdominal cavity irritating a nerve), they ended up sedating me after Josh was born, so I remember seeing Matt holding him next to me and very little else from the next 2 hours. Arrived in my room in postpartum around 9pm.

Ironically, though not the smoothest of days, I am so grateful that Josh arrived safely and is healthy that I would do it all again if I had to. God provided much grace and I have been healing much more quickly than I anticipated. God is good.
Wow, I can't believe I haven't posted since I got engaged! At least I have an excuse. Life has been absolutely INSANE. Planning a wedding in three months wasn't quite the piece of cake that maybe I thought it was going to be. At least I'm thinking that now that the wedding is NEXT SATURDAY.

But, in the midst of all of this wedding-planning craziness, at least I know I'm doing the right thing. I just love Chad from the very bottom of my heart and can think of no one else I'd rather spend eternity with. Its so nice having that feeling of belonging with him and I feel so excited to take our relationship to yet another level. We have been through a lot together in these last four years...high school, college, commutes back and forth to Provo, a mission, letters, my dating shenanigans while he was gone (so sorry Chad), new jobs, my finishing school, a new car, new apartment, engagement, and finally wedding plans. Chad has always been there for me. I feel like such a lucky girl; I don't know what I ever did to deserve him!

Yay, I love being in love. I love getting married next weekend. As emotional and scary the other stuff can be (ahem...rent, bills, car loans, tuition, real adulthood, etc.) I just know without a doubt that Chad and I will always be there for each other. And that what we are doing is exatly the right thing to do. Nothing in my life has ever felt more right.


So thanks for listening to my sappiness. I'm excited for many of you to get here and celebrate with me! Let's celebrate love!
We finished the Century ride last month with no problems. Since then, we've been doing 60- to 90- mile rides almost every weekend in addition to a 15-mile ride every weekday morning. And, I'm signed up for an Olympic distance triathlon in September, which is a 1500-meter swim, 40K hilly bike ride, and a 10K run. I've done triathlons in the past, but not for a few years and never this long. Ultimately I hope to do a half Ironman in 2011. 

The new painting series is still in a conceptual stage, though I did actually get some paint on canvas recently. It doesn't feel as important right now as the internal and physical work. Reclaiming the health that I lost last year has taken on monumental importance to me. Having always been prone to depression, I know what matters most to me right now, and this is it. 

But it's also about renewing my relationship to this place, which is the only geographical location that has ever truly felt like home to me. My new series will be about that: a sense of place. 

I also want to reclaim the vegan lifestyle that we were essentially forced to give up in northern Italy, where we reverted to unprincipled vegetarianism. Everything is affected by what we put into our bodies, everything. 

And now, some photos from the century and our recent rides.
ike today, i want to punch someone real hard. right on the mouth.

i am such a debbie downer lately, everything puts me in a bad mood. everything pushes me over the edge.
boo.

like today for example, i called my pharmacy to refill my insulin. i have BARELY enough to eat things today. just barely. so i call in and they tell me i am out of refills. strange, because last month they said the same thing. they faxed my doctor and he sent in the refill. the box my insulin came in said i had TEN REFILLS. i am not sure how it went from ten to zero, but whatever. my diabetes doctor is not practicing anymore. last month around the 24th i received a letter saying he was no longer seeing patients, and that all future appointments were cancelled. so now i have to find a new doctor. fucking awesome. i doubt anyone knows a good diabetes doctor. maybe megan facer? 

anyway, i just wanted to whine some more on the internet so i hopefully don't freak out at trevor or start crying randomly.
I'm taking a break from meme's for awhile but will still be posting pictures now and then so you know that I'm still alive and well. A few weeks ago my daughter had an assignment in her photography class to take some shots that could be made into one panoramic shot using PhotoShop. I remembered that my camera has its own panoramic setting so I took my own shots along side of her. This is one in a series of four. I just used my camera's editing program to make the panoramic shot. Who needs PhotoShop anyway?

I'm pretty pleased with  how it turned out and wish I had been using it a lot earlier. I could have gotten some great shots on vacation. Oh well, there's always this year.

Click on the panoramic to get the full size. It's beeeuuutttiiifffuuullllll.
I have been an artist most of my life….Finger paints, play dough, coloring books and crayons. I could never get enough! As a teenager, I had the most amazing art teacher in high school. Her name was Mrs. Lucas. She believed every one of her students had talent. She introduced me to silk screening, pottery and watercolor. I enjoyed it all. As time went on, my attention drifted to antiquing. I found that I love vintage furniture, dishes, buttons, jewelry, quilts and linens. One day about 10 years ago, I saw the most gorgeous vintage dresser. It was painted white, and the top, sides and drawer fronts were covered with broken vintage china! Suddenly, every thing seemed to click. All the art classes and the years spent drifting around antique stores and flea markets just came together in the beautiful world of mosaics. I love repurposing old furniture, teapots, trays, birdhouses, old windows and even guest bath counter tops into beautiful and functional works of art.
Below is the first part of an unfinished presentation I'm writing for my contemporary poetry and poetics seminar. I'm enjoying writing it and I thought some of you might be interested. The Tapeworm Foundry is a conceptual long poem (fuck, what isn't) available on UbuWeb. Link.
It's strange that my measure of 'presentability' is whether or not I'm comfortable posting something on here. "Is it good enough/engaging enough to be posted on my blog?!" versus "is it good enough to perform in front of 20 people, including someone who will give me a grade?" *rolls eyes at myself and then lights a cigarette*
Also really enjoyed this blog post from a recently-discovered blog that has quickly become one of my favourites. Wicked shit about suicide-art Badiou embodiment etc.
Also just wanted to say thank you to people who read this. My, uh, readership, has drastically increased over the past 4 months and I am genuinely appreciative of all who give a shit. *here I roll my eyes again and feel sheepish*
the word 'sheepish' is strange, yeah?

“The issue is not about poetry online. It’s the other thing that’s at issue here: online poetry, a poetry that explicitly includes the processes of coding, programming and designing as part of the creative act; a poetry whose content is, to some degree, specific to the qualities of the environment in which it exists.” DWH.

In “Antifesto,” Darren Wershler-Henry refers to creative writing as “code.” The Tapeworm Foundry engages with this idea and exemplifies "our current confrontation with the codes and code-condition of language, poetry, and digital media" (Drucker). The Tapeworm Foundry performs this process of coding/de-coding the ideological and material foundations of creative production. Each page functions like a screen of data that provides an inventory of information; a list of proposals for art projects and instructions for creating poetry that subvert the traditional modernist definition of art and poetry. In this sense, the poem is radically non-hierarchical, combining low and high culture seamlessly and with great humour. Equally demonstrative of this equalization is the use of “andor” to separate each unit. This strategy implies an opening up of language; the poem unfolds itself and the reader takes up its possibilities.
This focus on form and presentation rather than content emphasizes the materiality of language and poetry-construction/coding. This technique is reminiscent of the language poets attempt to dislodge the signified from the signifier. Similarly, Wershler-Henry shows that language is not inherently meaningful; language is given meaning when positioned within a particular narrative context. Although traditional reading and writing codes typically remain “invisible” and unnoticed, the value of online poetry is that the coding/de-coding is explicit and thus functions as a critique of passive or uncritical reading. Thus, The Tapeworm Foundry challenges and subverts the traditional/modernist narrative codes that condition readers to consume and engage with a text in a predetermined, prescribed framework of reference. The ceaseless flow of text - each unrelated component - prevents the reader from superimposing a linear and all-encompassing narrative onto the poem. As a result, we can't consume the text as we would a commodity. Both the construction of the text as material object and as a narrative is magnified. In this sense, Wershler-Henry decodes how language functions by producing a meta-code that draws attention to its own construction in order to critique how code functions in general.
It is common knowledge that, despite their denials, the Sudanese government has long provided material support to the world's most stunningly brutal militia, the Lord's Resistance Army ( LRA).

The LRA is Ugandan cult army without any current political agenda. It was founded by Joseph Kony in the 1980s. Since then Kony and his followers have been moving through deepest brush in Uganda, Congo, south Sudan and CAR, emerging only to plunder villages and to murder, rape, abduct and mutilate people. They abduct children to use as sex slaves, porters and to replenish their fighting forces.

Sudanese planes have been spotted delivering arms and supplies to LRA outposts. A witness reported watching a plane full of weapons being unloaded, after which children were brought out of the bush and put on the plane. Presumably the children were flown back to northern Sudan to be sold on the slave market.

After the LRA attacked a Central African village in Obo, they took three hundred children. I spoke to a UN rep who described the silence of the childless village, interrupted by the sound of weeping parents.

In the 1990s and early 2000s the LRA served as a proxy army for the Sudanese government in its war against south Sudan -- just as that same regime would later work in tandem with the marauding Janjaweed militia.

In the past year alone the LRA have killed thousands and sent almost a half a million traumatized people fleeing from their homes. The militia has now moved into south Darfur -- an area controlled by the Sudanese Government.

LRA leader Joseph Kony and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir have a thing or two in common. Both are wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Ugandan Army has pursued and killed some members of the LRA, but in Sudan they have been offered a safe haven by their patron, Omer al-Bashir.
Today, ordinary Americans get a rare opportunity to weigh in on a life-and-death issue: Who gets access to scarce, life-saving treatments during a disaster?

The public has been invited to participate in a teleconference (PDF) in which advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will discuss ethical guidance they have drawn up for rationing mechanical ventilators in a severe influenza pandemic. (As we've reported, many states have been quietly laying plans for such a scenario. For example, Florida has considered excluding certain patients from ventilators.) 

Chances are, few people will phone in to join Monday's meeting. CDC officials have not advertised the session outside of a notice published late in the Federal Register.

But you can join in. The hourlong conference takes place at 3 p.m. EST and anyone can listen to the proceedings by calling (866) 919-3560 and entering passcode 4168828. According to the agenda, the committee is scheduled to vote on the guidance before it opens the meeting to public comments. The document will then go to the full advisory committee to the director of the CDC for approval.
On April 27th I will begin a fast of water only in solidarity with the people of Darfur and as a personal expression of outrage at a world that is somehow able to stand by and watch innocent men, women and children needlessly die of starvation, thirst and disease.

The Darfur crisis deepened on March 4th when the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese president President Omar al-Bashir for his essential role in the murder, rape, torture and displacement of millions. Al-Bashir retaliated immediately by expelling thirteen key international aid agencies from Sudan, including Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, CARE, Oxfam and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) along with three highly respected Sudanese agencies.

Sudanese U.N. Ambassador Abdalhaleem claimed his government would have no problem filling in any gaps created by the expulsions. But U.N. humanitarian affairs chief John Holmes spoke honestly about the desperate realities: "We do not, as the U.N. system, the NGOs do not, and the Sudanese government does not have the capacity to replace all the activities that have been going on. This is a decision which is likely to have a major impact on millions of people in Darfur who are in need on a daily basis, of life-saving humanitarian assistance." According to the UN, as of this May more than a million people will be without food aid, medical assistance, and drinkable water.

The United Nations humanitarian agencies issued their joint plea; "The suspended NGOs account for more than half of the capacity for the aid operation in Darfur. If the life-saving assistance these agencies were providing is not restored shortly, it will have immediate, lasting and profound impacts on the well being of millions of Sudanese citizens. These organizations provide a lifeline to 4.7 million people."

I undertake this fast in the heartfelt hope that world leaders who know what is just and right will call upon the Government of Sudan to urgently readmit all of the expelled agencies or otherwise insure that the gap is filled, giving aid workers unimpeded access to the populations before they begin to die in numbers that could dwarf the Rwandan genocide. I also call upon President Obama and other leaders with influence to help build a credible peace process that can end the suffering in Darfur.
There is one thing that I can remember that was consistent from birthday to birthday growing up. That was our birthday cakes. My mom would go to great lengths to make sure that our cake was perfect and she did a very VERY good job at it. One common theme from year to year was that they all were decorated with small toys. I don't really know why this is significant or why I remember it so much. I just remember the excitement of blowing out the candles looking at what was soon to be your new toy ... as soon as the frosting was licked off of the feet of course.


As I type this, my hands smell of sweet frosting and I am excited and honored that it is my turn to pass on my sweet mom's cake tradition to my family. I am not trained in "the art of cake decorating" like my mom was. She worked for a bakery until I was born and was quite skilled. In the future, I'd LOVE to take a class or two on cake decorating skills. BUT for now, my kids get my novice approach to cake decorating. For one of my first cakes, I am quite pleased with the outcome!



I look forward to tomorrow when Jace will gather with his family to celebrate his birthday. I also am looking forward to watching him thoroughly enjoy my hard work ... even if all he really notices or cares for is to satisfy his sweet tooth!


My baby is one!!

ouldn't move.
Couldn't breathe.
Couldn't think.

It was that intense.

There was that slippery warmth in my belly, making my skin tingle, and my hands shake. It was the warm wetness of his lips, the way they kissed me until I had no idea where we were.

It was the electric feeling of his hands gently cradling my face. Those big, strong hands touching me so gently, thumbs brushing my jaw.

It was his eyes, a gorgeous chocolate brown, with tiny flickers of gold, like his eyes had pieces of the sun in them.

It was the baked furnace feel of his hands touching me, like his touch left an imprint, a tattoo, a burn.

It became his hands buried in my shoulders, when I tried to (reluctantly) push him away.

It became me wanting him to bruise me with his handprints, to mark me with the force of his kiss.

When the hotness of his mouth trailed fluttering kisses down my neck, to my collarbone, burning me from the inside, I looked at him, really looked at him.

His lips were swollen from our kisses (they looked like mine felt) tender and pink and oh so enticing.

I stood there, shaking, his hands holding my shoulders, and in that instant, I felt that ache of how long it's been since I've felt, since I've let myself feel, since I had the courage to just let go.

When I looked at him again, our eyes caught, and I felt the electricity between us. I felt the warmth coming off him in waves.

He slid his hand against my cheek, and ran the ball of his thumb over my lips.

"Your mouth--" he said wonderingly, his eyes moving down to my lips, before returning to my eyes.

And he kissed me again.
Hi Everyone :)  I know I have been away for a while.  I have made many changes in the New Year.  I am happy.  I am well.  I am dancing to the beat of my own drum!  I am doing many, many really wonderful things.  I have been receiving a great deal of e-mails from everyone worried that I am not well.  I am terrific!  Really....Truly...Terrific!   

I do miss everyone!  Beginning in 2010 I changed courtroom assignments and I am working with a new judge in a very busy trial court.  The move took me away from the office I have been in for the last 12 years!  A big, big change for me, but a really good one.  I am so happy in my new assignment and I just love the work I am doing!  It is so much fun and the types of cases we get are so entertaining.  It is just wonderful!   When I come back to blogging, I will have many really funny stories to tell :)))  


I am also taking some classes, studying, have two young adult kids living with me...terrorizing me....ooops, did I say that? LOL..... and have just had a tremendous amount of social commitments lately.  Don't forget my Little Magpie and Marvin the Black Cat too...the animals for those of you that don't know....LOL  This is the reason for my absence.When we make dramatic changes in our lives sometimes we just have to kind of be selfish and focus on ourselves for a bit.  That is where I have been....reorganizing, changing things up, creating a new and better, happier life for myself.    When I make big changes I am the type of person that I turn inward to focus.  For me, it is the only way to hear my heart's true calling.  How does one visit 160 blog friends, multiple friends living in my own city, work, take classes, exercise and spend time with cherished loved ones....it's a full plate and I know we all have them.  Life is so amazing isn't it.  Sometimes our path is peaceful and sometimes it is just an incredibly wild ride.  I think the good news is that all things pass.  There are seasons so when we are in a good one, wow, be happy, enjoy it.  When we are in bad ones, take heart in knowing they will pass.  Right now I am enjoying this journey I am taking...it is hectic but it is a good, good path and I am thankful for it.  

I was thinking about closing my blog but I feel strongly it is something I do want to come back to.  Blogging has been a great joy to me.  I love all my wonderful and creative friends.  You guys inspire and delight me!  Your friendships do mean a great deal to me, and like I say, I have missed everyone.  As you all know, the more followers one gets, the more time it takes to blog.  It is a huge commitment of time, love and  emotions.  I want to post things people actually want to read, not just post for the sake of posting.   My blog and the lack of attention to it of late has weighed heavily on my mind.  You all are important to me and I just have not been able to express that to you.   I am sorry for that.  I apologize to those of you who have been worried.

I am officially still on hiatus.  I will return mid February to wish you all Happy Valentine's Day!  I have many fun things to share with you all and I am looking forward to coming back and sharing my life with you through my blog!

In the meantime, I send you bundles of love and happy wishes and tons of kisses!  Enjoy your lives!  Have fun!  Live with passion and seek out what makes your hearts sing!  Make all your dreams come true!  This is my wish for you!

I love you!
xoxo

Okay, so this isn't really a paradigm shift to me, just something that I was thinking about recently. But maybe it will be a paradigm shift to someone else.

What makes a hero? That we could debate
Is a hero a constant state of being, like being male or female
Or is it something we grow into, like being a man or a woman
Or is it something we are for a fleeting moment
Yet recognized forever
Such as an olympic gold medal winner
Or is it something that comes and goes
Like a world record holder
Who knows

This I am convinced of, though
A true hero isn't made by accomplishing spectacular feats
Everybody can be a hero
Sometimes you'll be recognized as a hero by everybody
Other times, nobody will know except you and God
But I'm convinced that everyone can be a hero

For what is a hero
Except someone who simply puts others before themselves
When a friend needs a shoulder to cry on
And you are there, you are a hero
When your partner needs a task done
And you do it for them, even though you don't have to, you are a hero
When someone is to blame for something
And you take the blame, even though you're at fault
You're a hero, even if they never realize it

Most of the time, opportunities to be a hero are small
Overlooked
But many times, just a small dose of selflessness
Could transform you from the person who made the problem worse
To somebody's hero

Yes, you have needs too
And there are many times when standing up for what you need is good
But there are times when you should forget your own needs
And that was one of those times
I can't say what you were thinking
But to me the right thing to do seemed obvious

If you didn't feel like being a hero
You didn't have to be
You could have ignored the situation
Instead, you had to go and make it worse
Is it really that difficult to see that sometimes what you need just doesn't matter
That the right thing to do is to give up your need for a moment
You didn't have to come and try to help
Although if you did, you could have been her hero

I just think it's so sad
That in a moment where you could have been a hero
You not only chose not to be
But became the enemy
The choice seems so clear and so simple to my eyes
Maybe its not to yours

Yet the fact remains
You could have been a hero
But you weren't
I watched “The Sound of Music” tonight for the first time in a long time. 

I saw it at Wal-Mart among various other titles I might have bought, but something told me to buy “The Sound of Music.”  I have fond memories of watching it when TV was still cool enough to show things like “The Wizard of Oz,” “Ben Hur,” and of course “The Sound of Music” once a year.  I don’t know about y’all, but that was a big deal in my family.  We REFUSED to miss any of these films the one night a year they came on because we didn’t have a VCR until I was nearly in high school.  As an adult I’ve looked on it simply as nostalgia.  A breath of fresh air for my polluted adult attitude. 

But tonight, “Aidelwiess” in particular made me rather misty.  I never get misty at movies.  But something struck me about all of it and I didn’t know why until a few scenes later at the ball Captain Von Trapp throws right before Maria leaves for the convent again.  In the scene, Maria and the captain dance an old Austrian folk dance.  And nostalgia grew into something like regret. 

Why aren’t folk dances appreciated anymore?  Why does everyone feel the need to booty dance and grab-ass at a party?  Yes, it’s true that people still do folk dances and ballroom dancing, etc.  But not MOST people.  We don’t grow up learning these dances and the folk songs and stories that used to keep the whole of humanity from spiraling off the deep end of despair. 

There’s such beauty in these things.  Real beauty.  Not what we think of as beauty today:  the glitz and glam of false airbrushed beauty.  The whole “ooohhh shiny” mentality has never set well with me.  Shiny has no substance.  All it does is reflect something back that we like to think we are, but aren’t.  What we are lies in folk dances, beautiful melodies (like “Aidelwiess”) with simple lyrics that say nothing of sorrow or how messed up or angry the singer is or how they’d rather be bumping booties with the ho up the block. “Aidelweiss” is a song about a flower.  A flower, people.  And it nearly made me cry.

Don’t get me wrong, though.  I’m all for freedom of expression and my ideas and thoughts are generally fairly liberal and always open-minded.  Yes, I love Tool and The Afghan Whigs and The Beastie Boys.  But all this needs to be balanced with something purer.  Everyone needs to try to find their innocence again – or at least some part of it.  Like gemstones or precious metals, innocence is rare and it should be treasured even if you only take it out for special occasions.
Elvis decided to consume a baby blue zebra. More like a teenager actually. Maybe the teenager was mouthing off, telling Elvis he was an idiot and generally behaving as teenagers do. Maybe Elvis just had a sudden snack attack and couldn't control himself. Either way, when I got up yesterday, the above picture represents how I found Elvis.

At first I wasn't too worried about it. Fish are not notoriously picky eaters. The only criteria that food really has to meet is that it fits in their mouth. I regularly lose babies to the bigger fish in my tank and I'm okay with that. Circle of life, extra protein snack, whatever, it's all good. 

But Elvis apparently either over estimated the size of his own mouth or under estimated the size of the other fish. Because he swam around with that dead teenager in his mouth for hours. Like, twelve of them. 

I started getting a little worried after the first five or six hours. At one point I even netted Elvis and tried removing the dead one by hand. I know right? Who lives the life of Riley? Who? That's right people, I do. Unfortunately, when faced with his insane keeper trying to "save" him, Elvis chomped down harder on his prize and refused to give it up. So I tossed him back in the tank and resigned myself to losing him when he finished choking to death on his snack. Honestly, I'm not even sure fish can choke to death what with their gills and all, but you get my point.

Twelve hours after first seeing Elvis in his predicament I saw him swim into the plants and come up with an empty mouth. I immediately checked the tank and saw the dead fish laying behind the plants. Yay! I scooped the body out and deposited it into the appropriate burial location. Yes, the kitchen trash can, wrapped in paper towel and stuffed in a plastic bag. Then I went to check to see how Elvis was doing, and had to laugh. Because now he was swimming around with his mouth wide open like he couldn't close it. I started wondering if that was going to be permanent, him swimming around looking like a slack jawed idiot, but this morning he's back to normal.

So at the end of the day, what have we learned? Fish are gluttonous half-wits with no spatial comprehension. Guess that's as good a lesson as any
The tea lover, that is . . . 

It's no secret that I love tea and my very favorite type of tea is chai.  Many tea companies (including my favorite company Not Just Tea) now make chai and you can pay a pretty penny for a box of twenty tea bags.  But really all traditional chai is is a spiced black tea.  

I've thought about making my own chai for a while not but never really got around to it.  Until today when my sister, who loves chai as well, called me to ask for the ingredients to make it at home since paying $5 a cup for it at Starbucks is not a good look.  So I googled and came up with this:  Awesome (and Economical) Chai concentrate.  Now, I have lots of black tea around here which I don't like to drink because it's pretty bland on it's own so I was excited to give this recipe a try.
For those of you who know me March is usually a very fun month for me. It has my very favorite Holiday- Love the Irish!!!, spring is starting to sprout, my beautiful baby was born, and well overall it just is.
This year- not so much.
Starting with the morning of the second day visit to the ER to the ensuing progression of difficulties (how is a person supposed to "kinda" be on bed rest with a two year old?). I like to think I work hard at looking at positives and when I can't find any I work till I feel better. Unfortunately, this is not so much an option with this baby.
This weekend though did spark a bit of the old for me. Ryan and I were able to load up the car and little guy (with DVD player) and travel the five hours to Baker City to visit his Aunt and Uncle. We went because I had business in Ontario, but the real joy was the visiting. I love Baker! For me it is the idyllic little town, part of this I know is simply because we don't live there and see all the troubles and when we go we get to have relaxing meals with family and their retired friends sharing intellectual conversation and fun stories. It is so fun for me to be back in a Valley town with surrounding mountains and clear views of wilderness, anitque"y" stores and knowing almost everyone who comes through the coffee shop.
It was also a wonderful sight to see my little Quinnster on the ground gently playing with Jinx, aunt Sandy's sweet tabby, or sitting on the front porch steps with Uncle Rod quizzing him on everything in the neighborhood. These like this help remind me that he isn't a little demon out to terrorize his mother, but rather just a sweet little kid exploring his world with a mischievous side to him too (genetically inherited from his father.)
Of course it also helps that I can always count on Aunt Sandy to send me home with a great stack of books, that I quickly devour (yep, already down by one and it was a laugh out loud read- Thank you sooo much.)
I am also very grateful that as the month is on the end stretch I have a trip to California this weekend coming. Can't wait to celebrate Quinn's second birthday at Disneyland with my family!
Already have my massage scheduled for when I get in. Here's to hoping it will help me kick off a much better April- Go dtaitní an ghrian go bog bláth ar do chlár éadain!
I just finished reading one of my textbooks, written by Eugene Peterson, and he was talking about discipling relationships and what people need.  I loved one of his quotes: 

"Sometimes I need a teacher, someone to explain the Scriptures, to clarify the Christian belief in some circumstance or relationship.  But mostly I do not: I need to become what I already know.  Sometimes I need a helper, someone to assist me out of a jam, someone to keep me accountable to my commitments.  But mostly I do not: I need to enter into the reality that is already God in and around me."

I am pretty passionate about mentorship relationships in the Christian context, and I think Peterson hits the nail on the head.  Too often when we are walking with people, we are trying to tell them how to be, when they already know.  We need to do more listening and ask more questions, aiming to help each other see the bigger picture of who we are in Christ.  It could really change things!
We have exciting news, Janessa made Jetettes and for those of you that don't know that is the drill team at Dixie High School where she will be attending next year. She has been in a dance class at the high school this year that Ms. P the advisor teaches so I think she had a little of an advantage. Well that and being 5'10" and all legs, being able to do the head stand, kicking to the ceiling lights and pulling off red lipstick lips most of the criteria for being a jetette oh yeah, and a mom with an ATM card. According to Craig Hammer I will be using that quite frequently! (thanks Craig)
Our sweet friend Hailey Hammer is a co-captain and she is adorable, it is such a great group of girls I'm excited for the new year. Late nights, early mornings, car washes, selling cookie dough, drama, fund raisers, birthday's for girls, selling concessions, traveling for competition, feeding 22 hungry girls, football games, basketball games, parades and these are the only ones I know about I'm sure there's plenty more to learn about being a jetette mom but I have to great friends to help me Marcia and Tresa have it all figured out!

(PS the picture of Janessa and Malory is for real, they are best friends and what Mal lacks in height she makes up for in heart <3!)
My mind feels like a bowl of noodles these days! So many thoughts entwined, none really leading to anywhere! And it’s difficult to pick up and talk about one...they just keep breaking! 

There’s work, where my honeymoon period is over...and now there’s real stuff to deal with. The settling down bit which I don’t think I’ve ever done before. 

There’s life as I knew it – travelling, blogging, photography and so much more...part of which I want again.

There’s life as I’ve never known before, all thanks to somebody new. It’s a trance like state; I seem to have lost touch with everything else! And I am definitely not complaining!!!

There are surprises every day, and so many stories to tell, which I hope I soon will :)

For now I have decided to pick up the chopsticks and enjoy this bowl of sweet confusion!!!
This week I spent an hour on the phone crying with a sweet friend of mine who recently had a
miscarriage. She was asking all the normal questions... Why did He make me pregnant just to take her away?...What did I do wrong?...Will it happen again?...How could He let this happen?...Do You love me?
I really don't have the answers, but I have asked all the questions many times. Some of the questions we ask can not be answered this side of heaven!

That same morning the kids and I had read the account in Mark about Jesus walking on the sea
out to tired, terrified disciples. And just that morning, I wrote in my journal these words....
"The storms of life are not because You do not love us but because You DO. They are meant to force us into and encounter with an awesome God. Thank You that You always love me even when I deserve it the least!"

I might not have all the answers and that is OK. I can listen to the pain of a friend. I can shed tears for her and a life she will not hold here on earth. I can understand the pain and the questions as I have walked that path myself. I can tell her the pain eases with time but tears are never far away! I am so glad I have a God who walks with me in the midst of the storms of my life!
Sadly, my four day weekend has come to an end.  Booo.  I will join the rest of the world and go to work tomorrow.  Again with the booo.

I did do a few fun things!

Friday I hung out with Linda and Shelly.  This hanging out included trash tv, girl talk, and frozen yogurt!  
Saturday included cleaning, grocery shopping and a whole lot of waiting.  Jesse got home (!!!) 8pm that night and I made BBQ Chicken Pizza.  This is the same pizza I made last weekend.  It's so good though!  We sat around eating and watching tv.  I love having him here!
Sunday we braved the crowds with three kids and went to the Kite Fest.  Man, was there a lot of people!  We parked allll the way by the animal shelter and walked alllll the way to Zilker.  It's not bad at all to walk, but kids make it a little harder to take on.  We got there and right away got all 3 kites in the air.  Mia was so excited!  She was just laughing!  She's never flown a kite {heck I've never flown a kite!} and it was fun to see her reaction.  Here are a couple of pics from that day.
Sunday night Jesse and I headed over to our friend's house.  Scott & Becky were so kind to invite us over and make us dinner.  One of the sides was couscous.  It was my first time trying it & I thought it was really good.  It'll probably make its way into next week's menu!  But anyway!  On  to the fun part...we got to meet their daughter Avery Elizabeth!!  She is just too cute!  Sorry, I didnt get any pics of the little one, but believe me...she's precious!  
Monday we got to sleep in.  It felt good!  Normally I cant sleep past 730am, but that morning I slept til 930!  I'm sure it had a lot to do with the time change.  But still, it felt good!  After our coffee and cereal we decided to be productive.  He worked out on the yard, while I worked out indoors.  Nice little workout.  We went out and ran a few errands then picked up Hai Ky.  Yum!  I always seem to get the same thing when I go there{vermicelli bowl with pork}so I think that next time I'm gonna try something different.  I'm already excited!  We took the food home to enjoy and watched the Invention of Lying.  Good movie!  This was actually my second time seeing it.  I watched it on Saturday while I was waiting for Jesse to get here.  But, it was funny enough to watch again.  :)
Tuesday we did a whole lotta nothin'!  The weather called for laziness so we didn't fight it.  I did get Jesse to put up a shelf in the laundry area.  I've had a couple of ideas in my head for what to do about this small space.  Of course things dont always go accordingly so I'm having to figure something else out.  *sigh*  We did get out for a couple of hours!  We went to see She's Out of Your League.  Pretty funny movie!

Four days goes by quickly, let me tell ya!  The only good thing about the return of work is that I'll do better with my eating and my diet.  Work keeps my routine in order.

So cheers to a good week!
I had a wonderful encounter with God yesterday.

In an ordinary moment, He caught me by surprise. He met me where I was. He heard my cry. He spoke truth into my heart. 

We are going through a deep, dark valley, facing a personal battle that has turned everything upside down and inside out. I am praying, praying, praying - for healing, for deliverance, for grace, for strength. It is the hardest season we've walked through in our twelve years together - and if you know us, you know that we've had our share of hard seasons. 

Yesterday, I needed to be with other believers. I was drained. I needed to share my burden and be lifted up in prayer. I needed encouragement and nourishment from God's word. So, I left my sick children at home with Ben and went to our wonderful House Church.

Our leader took us into the book of Daniel, and the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Inside of such a familiar tale, God brought new revelation that spoke so clearly to my need, I could hardly contain myself. If you don't know the story, King Nebuchadnezzar commanded that all of the people bow down in worship before an idol. Three of his officials refused to do so. When he threatened them with certain death in his fiery furnace, they responded:
"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up." Dan. 3:16-18
It was the last verse that pierced my heart. The words that are still repeating in my mind: Even if. Even if. Even if.

Even if we never get our dream house...

Even if we never make it to Europe...

Even if Ben's business fails...

Even if our children fail us...

Even if I'm never healed of migraines...

Even if we get cancer...

Even if our circumstances never change...

Even if we don't get out of the valley...

Even if our lives fall apart, we will not turn away from God. We will not forget his promises, his faithfulness, his goodness, or his mercy.

We will not be abandoned.

We will be whole, and loved, and provided for.

We will have Jesus.
My Aunt Mary Jo passed away earlier this afternoon. She has been battling MS for many years now and has been in a nursing home for a while. She choked on some food Monday and lost consciousness. They did CPR on her and rushed her to the hospital. She has been in ICU ever since. They decided to take her off the ventilator today and she passed within an hour. I know she is in a better, happier place now, but it just saddens me. I feel for my cousins, her sons, and her grandchildren and her husband, Uncle Jerry. May God watch over them and give them peace during this time.
I will always remember Aunt Mary Jo as a young woman who would give me her clothes, and give me special things for my birthday and Christmas. When I was growing up, we would spend most holidays with her and my cousins. She had always been a frail person, but she was so bright in my eyes! I will miss her even though I haven't seen her in years.
I miss you and love you much Aunt Mary Jo. RIP.
Where oh where do I begin. I feel like we have been so busy lately. Between Addyson staying sick with ear infections, the boys school, baseball and t-ball practice, housework, and laundry; well I feel like I am always on the go.

This is our first year of t-ball/baseball, and so far they both love it. Since Austin is older it is going to take him a little time to catch on, but thankfully he has a wonderful coach. And he makes sure he stops to take the time to show the kids what they need to know. I have to say, I was a little nervous the first time he got up to bat last night. But he actually hit the ball, and I loved it. I am trying to be the quiet mom. I don't want to be the parent yelling and screaming on the sidelines, this is simply only a game. And we are trying to teach them that this is for fun. They need to be kids and I don't want them stressing out over sports at this age.

Addyson is really on the go these days. Life with an active baby is a little more difficult but I love it. I am just trying to get us on a schedule. We are trying to work on set nap times and that will be my cleaning/soap opera time. Yes, I do watch one soap opera a day. I grew up with my babysitter and my grandmother watching this show. And if you are wondering what this show may be, well it is The Young and the Restless. Addyson is also starting to be a little more chatty. She waves bye bye to her brothers and daddy every morning. And she has started saying bye bye to them. This is only when she wants to. She loves chewing on anything. And I do mean anything. So all eyes are on Addybell when she is on the go. She also has learned to play with the bar stools, and it is the cutest thing.

I have to say, I am so looking forward to spring break. I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. And hopefully I will have a post tomorrow evening about a winning pine wood derby car.
You might have already heard of this new cookie diet fad that assures you'll shed pounds pronto. Dr. Siegal has formulated a diet that is truly easy to follow. You eat six cookies a day (average cost $8) along with a 500 calorie meal consisting of lean protein and veggies. Making it an average daily calorie intake of 1000. This is nothing new, Dr. Siegal has been treating weight-loss patients to this diet for well over thirty years in his private clinic. He has recently made it available to the general public through his site cookiediet.com.
The formula is pretty simple, there is no specific schedule to follow you have the freedom to eat the cookies when your stomach starts to growl. You are limited to six per day and you can only drink water. These cookies look pretty boring. I'm willing to bet they taste more like cardboard than a chocolate chip soft and chewy.I can't say I fall prey to these diet fads. But even I am tempted to try it. Maybe I can finally lose the little pouch of fat relentlessly resting over my lower abdominal, that my personal trainer keeps telling me "it's all diet".With this latest diet craze taking people by storm, the questions that pop to mind are simple, like, are you even getting all the nutrients you need on a cookie diet? What about all the vitamins that you get from following a well balanced diet? Or will I have enough energy throughout the day with such low calorie intake? Dr.'s are savvy because in addition to the cookies, I believe Dr. Siegal sell you a multi vitamin that you should take daily so that you don't iss out on vital minerals and nutrients. is that even enough?
Call me old fashioned, but I believe when it comes to a lean body it is a balanced pairing of exercise and eating healthy. A diet consisting of, lean proteins, complex carbs, and fresh fruits and veggies, and absolutely no processed or fast foods. Along with a mix of cardio and strength training. It is truly hard work. I have been living on this diet for years now, it took me a while to get there. Trust. But my weight has been kept under control. That doesn't go without saying that I go through my weak moments and eat a pizza or a burger from time to time. What I hate the most is the guilt that comes with eating those high in calories foods, that are so satisfying.
Truly, I don't really see the harm in trying the cookie diet if and only if - it's short term. As a tool to get your motor running. But what happens when you start the cookie diet, are successful at shedding those stubborn pounds and continue to rely on this cookie diet fad as a way of life? Ghee that was a long question. You can take a better look at a coverage by Good Morning America. Which reports the facts, and details of this long term devotee, how she lost it - weight wise - and in my opinion mentally.
One of the more unconscionable things Mr. Stupak is doing is lying about the current (bad) legislation. He’s telling his colleagues that women using their own money in the exchanges will be able to buy insurance coverage that pays for abortion. There is no abortion funding in the current bad bill. What Mr. Stupak wants to do is move one step forward to outlawing abortion through health care legislation, one step at a time.

As an aside, Rep. Stupak’s scheduled 11 a.m. press conference was postponed due to what’s being called “a scheduling conflict.” You decipher it. Congress members, we’re finding out through the health care debate, aren’t very bright and since this legislation is complex, with the exchanges making things worse, all sorts of things can be said to frighten the ignorant.

It’s unconscionable that men who call themselves “liberal” are saying women should suck Stupak language up in the name of a bad health care bill that is much less than Democrats should accept. But that’s what we’re hearing from “progressive” men.

Michael Moore is one of the only powerfully visible males to decide Bart Stupak had gone too far, writing today a wonderful essay on the idiocy of Mr. Stupak’s position. Enter John Dingell, a powerful, longtime force in the House, who is getting the message from women that we understand compromise, because we’re asked to do it all the time, but Bart Stupak’s language and his insistence that he’s more important than the majority who support women’s self-determination is one step way too far.  Things remain fluid, with there still a strong probability that the Democrats will still pull this off. However, they need to do it without caving to Bart Stupak.

BREAKFAST: Papaya; baguette with cream cheese; black coffee

SNACK: Fruit or yogurt

LUNCH: Grilled chicken with steamed vegetables or a potato and salad — or with just a small amount of rice and beans

SNACK: Cereal bar or crackers with juice; at 5 p.m., coffee with pão de queijo (cheese bread)

DINNER: Pasta with passionflower juice; one or two glasses of wine (once a week)

Average calories per day: 1800

WHY IT WORKS: We don't do frozen food; we like things made fresh every day. Food is a celebration, and we often have people over for long meals. I only feel guilty about eating sometimes when I look in the mirror! But I try to be reasonable on both sides — not overindulging in food and not worrying so much about my weight. For instance, rice and beans, a typical dish, has a lot of calories and carbs, so I try to eat just a little.  ANNE MOLLET, 26

BREAKFAST: One piece of black bread; scrambled eggs with mushrooms, tomatoes, and cucumber on the side; black coffee

LUNCH: Sandwich with fresh lettuce, tomato, and eggs on bakery bread

DINNER: Fish wrapped in foil with onions, thyme, sea salt, pepper, and olive oil, cooked in the oven or on the barbecue for 20 minutes; salad with homemade dressing of honey, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil

Average calories per day: 1,200

WHY IT WORKS: In France, it's important to pay attention to what you eat (three meals and no snacks) and how you eat. Fresh food is essential, so I go to the market on Saturday mornings. I also spend time preparing the table, since presentation is 50 percent of the taste. Your senses are connected, and your eyes should tell your palate you want to eat. If it tastes good, then your senses agree. The only exception: my grandma's escargot.
The day after tomorrow is my ROM, and my friend Joan just told me I'm the most relaxed bride ever. Other than physically going to get my hair dyed and buying my own shoes/gloves/hat, I was virtually kiao kah-ing (relaxing; not doing a thing) the entire time!! AND THAT'S COZ I HAD THE MOST FABULOUS, EXPERIENCED AND HELPFUL PEOPLE making my wedding happen!!! See that's the shitty thing about most of life's most exciting and memorable events - you don't get a freaking rehearsal. Wedding? Most of us hope to only do it once, and with that one chance you've got to do it right. Giving birth? Won't pop out twice. Losing your virginity? Most likely not very pleasant with no experience. And therefore, when it comes to weddings... Relax. Don't try to control every single detail since you are likely to be really ignorant about most things anyway! Let the right people handle it for you and just go for the ride! It should be fun! Ok lah fine I'm only saying that coz I have the most ridiculously efficient and awesome wedding planners EVER. Wedding planners are so bloody important... Even if it costs extra, don't scrimp on it man!! Who wants to fuss over nitty gritty to throw a wedding?? Headed by Vernetta Lopez (REMEMBER?? UNDER ONE ROOF!!! DENISE!) who surprisingly enough opened a wedding planning company.There were a few companies (like 5 in total) interested to sponsor wedding planning for me but man, Eternally Yours really, really impressed. Like bowled me over. Gillian (manager) asked the wedding planning companies to try to come up with vendors who were willing to sponsor wedding necessities for me.Lois from Eternally Yours was so on the ball and just kept throwing suggestions and ideas on venues, themes, etc etc. THAT's what we brides really need. (Smacks table top assertively) Sometimes it gets so tiresome and we just think "What the fuck am I doing? Why am I doing all these tedious, expensive shit? Don't get married lah, fuck it." And then it's like the men are so disinterested! Mad sian. I'm sure ALL brides felt this way at least once. We just need fervid enthusiasm and ideas and positivity from someone who knows how to handle everything. It just keeps us going, you know? And suddenly it's something fun again, something to look forward to. The event of a lifetime. :) Within literally freaking HOURS Eternally Yours contacted sponsors and were telling me that responses were good but yet to be finalised... In the end... They found... Photographers... Gowns... Venue... Food... EVERY SINGLE FUCKING THING IS SPONSORED. I even suspected they used black magic coz it's really not easy to convince vendors to give out sponsorships, especially since I'm no Fann Wong!! I was so bloody touched I really was damn close to like crying or something!!! Sob sob. Why do I always meet the best people? (In contrast another wedding planning company told me she cannot get sponsors. Not even 1! WTF!! Your aptitude needs a check.) If you need a wedding planner, use Eternally Yours!!
The Google Maps API provides a sophisticated way for developers and webmasters to add custom interactive maps to their websites. Version 3 of the API, released in May of 2009, represents a complete overhaul of the API in response to several years worth of user feedback on the previous version.

In this tutorial we’ll cover a few of the API’s simpler features by showing you how to add a map with a set of location markers to a website. Each marker will have an associated info bubble with the name and address of the location. What’s more, we’ll be loading the location data via Ajax, so this can be used as the first step towards developing a more sophisticated map-based application.

For example, if your site’s contact page shows the position of all your retail locations on a map, you could filter them dynamically (say, based on which ones offered certain features or were open on a given day) by sending those parameters to the server and displaying markers on the map based on the returned XML.

Before we start, you should have at least a basic understanding of jQuery. To learn more about any of the classes and methods we’ll be using, you can consult the Google Maps API reference. Before we start writing code, it’s best to examine the format of the XML data we’ll be using to load our location data.

The coordinates and information for each marker we want to place on our map will be contained in an XML file. This makes it easy to change it, or have it generated automatically by a server-side script pulling the information from a database. The XML is formatted as follows: The root element is markers, and it contains a series of marker  elements, each containing a text address, latitude, and longitude.

Before we can load this XML and use it to place markers on our map, we first need to include the Google Maps JavaScript and the jQuery library in our HTML page.
jQuery and the Maps API

The two libraries we’ll be relying on for our functionality are, unsurprisingly, jQuery and the Google Maps API library itself. As far as jQuery is concerned, you can simply download the latest version from the jQuery home page and include it in your HTML page as follows:We’re packaging all our map functionality inside a JavaScript object called MYMAP, which will help to avoid potential conflicts with other scripts on the page. The object contains two variables and two functions. The map variable will store a reference to the Google Map object we’ll create, and the bounds variable will store a bounding box that contains all our markers. This will be useful after we’ve added all the markers, when we want to zoom the map in such a way that they’re all visible at the same time.

Now for the methods: init will find an element on the page and initialize it as a new Google map with a given center and zoom level. placeMarkers, meanwhile, takes the name of an XML file and will load in coordinate data from that file to place a series of markers on the map.
Manolo says, it is Thursday, and you are all wound up and ready for the weekend to arrive because, for the first time in months, clement weather has been forecasted by the Channel 11 man of weather, Skip “Stormy” Steele (née Ranulph Grabble).

It has been the long and dreary winter, to say the least, and you are ready for it to be over, and even the slightest hint that Spring (Glorious Spring!!!) is in the offing is enough to send you into the frenzy of plan-making.

“A Picnic!,” you shouted to no one in particular when Stormy Steel announced sunshine and temperatures in the low 60s, “a picnic at the park, with small cucumber sandwiches and cold fried chicken and watermelon and potato salad…maybe red potato salad…and fruit-flavored iced tea…”

Your mind raced with the possibilities of frolicsome summery entertainment, never mind that any watermelon you could find would have been air freighted in from New Zealand and cost more than your first car, the 1968 Saab 96. (It looked like the upside down bathtub, and had 3 and the half on the tree, and the strange freewheeling thingy, and seemed to be designed by people who had heard about cars but had never actually seen one in person).

Time to take the deep breath.

Yes, the first day of spring is nearly here, but unless you live in the more southerly parts of North America (like perhaps Tegucigalpa or Cozumel) the weather is not yet all that. Soon, but not yet.

In the meantime, you know what you need, jelly sandals, like these, the Sunny Jelly Flats from Fendi. Congratulations to the Manolo’s internet friend, the Shannon, for being the first person to correctly identify this flats-wearing personage of note.
"One of the great mysteries of the Toyota debacle is why Toyota ignored the complaints for so long.  Or at least it's a mystery to reporters on cable news, abetted by consumer advocates who were all too happy to imply that Toyota didn't care how many people it killed as long as they made a profit.
Maybe so, but I doubt it; you don't usually make a profit by killing your customers.  It's too risky, in this age of nosy regulators and angry consumer activists.
Their behavior becomes a bit more explicable when you consider this argument from Ted Frank: In the original Sudden Acceleration Incident craze that afflicted America in the late eighties, the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration eventually ruled that the problem was ""pedal misapplication"", aka stepping on the gas when you meant to step on the brake.  These incidents were highly correlated with three things:  being elderly, being short, and parking (or leaving a parking space).    The elderly are more prone to the sort of neuronal misfiring described in yesterday's New York Times.  Shorter people have to hunt more for the pedals.  And starting up from a complete stop is the most likely time to press the wrong pedal.
I was interested in Frank's argument, so I took a look at the LA Times article, which is really admirably thorough.  Here are the results, categorized into a nifty, though not necessarily particularly useful, spreadsheet. I went one further than Frank, tracking down the ages of all but a couple of the named drivers. If y'all wondered why I wasn't blogging today, well, there's your answer.  I've excluded three cases where the information was just too sparse to have any idea what happened, but otherwise, that's the complete list.
Several things are striking.  First, the age distribution really is extremely skewed.  The overwhelming majority are over 55. In many of the other cases, we don't really know what happened, because there were no witnesses of exactly when the car started to run away.   In fact, it's a little hard to be sure that some of the cases were sudden acceleration incidents, because the witnesses to what happened in the car were all killed; the family is trying to reconstruct what happened from their knowledge of the deceased.  Obviously, most people are going to err on the side of believing that the car was at fault, rather than a beloved relative. 
Further complicating matters, most of the cases involve either a lawsuit against Toyota, a complainant facing possible criminal charges, or both. In some of the cases, the police or doctors have an alternate theory of what happened:  one of the SAIs was bipolar, which puts you at extraordinarily high risk of suicide, and no one knows what actually happened in the car.   At least two others involve young men who were driving at very high speed, which is something that young men tend to do with or without a sticky accelerator.  Several more of the drivers seem to have had a medical situation, like a stroke, to which doctors and/or police attribute the acceleration."
We are already into round 2 -woo hoo!  The voting link is here. EVEN IF YOU DID NOT FILL OUT A BRACKET, you can still vote.

The voting schedule is in 12 hour blocks to accommodate people in all timezones.  The instructions were apparently hard to read last time so I’ll try to make it a little simpler.  The polls open at midnight and noon each day and run for 12 hours. 

Today, the round 2 polls opened at midnight, March 19, 2010 EST.  The first set closes at noon on March 20, 2009 EST and the next set starts again until midnight. Keep checking about every 10-12 hours and you should catch each round of voting.  After the voting for Round 2 is over, we will unveil the second chance bracket.  Huzzah for second chances!  A while back you said you never forget your 1st romance novel.
I’m embarassed to admit that I have forgotten, but I do know that it
probably was one of those novels of the month found in Good Housekeeping,my
mom loved ‘em. I’ve been thinking of those stories I loved to read, and
one just sticks out, and I’d like to try to find it.

I don’t have much information except for 1 scene that is burned into my memory. It’s a
historical and the heroine’s name is Amy. She married an older guy, and I
got the impression that he was more into her than she was into him. Anyway,
she’s just had her 3rd or 4th kid and the husband starts sleeping in the
guest room w/no explanation. She thinks he’s having an affair, so one night
she tells him she’s going to her mom’s house, but of course she comes back
for some reason or another.

She goes into their bedroom and finds her nemisis naked w/a nightgown in her hand. Amy is furious and grabs the
tramp’s suitcase and nightgown, flings open the balcony doors and throws
the clothes onto the tree branches outside. Then she sets her sights on the
tramp and hussles her out onto the balcony and throws the tramps shoes at
her and hits her on the rear. hee hee Amy locks her out there and throws the
keys out the window, meanwhile the tramp is screaming, it’s starting to
rain, and Amy’s husband finally comes in to find out what’s going on.
Before he can say anything, Amy knees him in the groin and goes home to
mother.
With two months till Mother's Day, there's no excuse for another last-minute FTD bouquet of dyed carnations: Get Mom a copy of "Major Pettigrew's Last Stand," by Bethesda writer Helen Simonson. This thoroughly charming novel wraps Old World sensibility around a story of multicultural conflict involving two widowed people who assume they're done with love. The result is a smart romantic comedy about decency and good manners in a world threatened by men's hair gel, herbal tea and latent racism.

Ernest Pettigrew -- that's Major Ernest Pettigrew, to you -- insists on "careful, impeccable behavior." The retired British army officer sees himself as a lone defender of responsibility and tradition, which means that he's in a constant state of repressed irritation. In fact, he's a walking thesaurus of irritation. We see him annoyed, dyspeptic, displeased, disapproving, disappointed, dismayed, horrified, outraged, angry, appalled, exasperated, resentful, wincing and flinching! But "I was raised," he says calmly, "to believe in politeness above all," and watching him hold to that rule even when he's convinced that "everyone is a complete idiot" is a constant source of comedy in these pages.

Alone since the death of his wife six years ago, Major Pettigrew moves his stiff upper lip only to extend brief courtesies or -- when someone especially merits it -- sarcastic jabs. If Simonson can keep this up, she could be heir to the late John Mortimer, and if the "Masterpiece Theatre" people aren't already sending out casting calls for Major Pettigrew, they should get a move on with decorous haste.

The story opens with fresh grief, and it's a testament to the depth of Simonson's comic sense that she always keeps one foot planted on the tragic side of life. Just moments after Major Pettigrew receives a call that his younger brother has died, the doorbell rings. Mrs. Ali, a Pakistani widow who owns a small shop in the village, has come to collect the newspaper bill. As a rule, the major believes "it was never a good idea to confide in people," but when he blurts out the news of his brother's death, Mrs. Ali leads him into the living room, fetches him a cup of tea and speaks gently to him about her own raw sorrow.
"Surprisingly though, I was more concerned about whether my mother would continue to allow Eleanor to babysit us than about my own punishment.  In the forty-eight hours leading up to her discovery of the hole – really, I can’t believe it took her forty-eight hours; geez Mother, how about some attention to detail? – I worried more over the consequences for Eleanor than the consequences for me.

Eleanor remained our first-string babysitter that summer.  I have no idea whether she might have been put on disciplinary probation or given any other sort of talking-to by my mother, but I certainly never kicked another hole in my brother’s door. Oprah, you disappointed me

Sometime last year I had a conversation with a woman about some new initiative that Oprah was launching, and did I want to be involved?  We chatted for a while, but I never heard anything else.  Honestly, I wasn’t disappointed because the entire conversation made me feel like a fraud.  Because I don’t like Oprah.

There.  I said it.

I don’t have anything against her per se.  She’s a talk show host, for Pete’s sake, and certainly not a hateful windbag.  She’s likable enough, but I’ve just never seen the appeal.

Even back in 2003 when my PIMs and I were planning our first gathering in Chicago, a few of them fantasized about how cool it would be if Oprah had us on her show.  At that point, we actually were newsworthy – a bunch of women who met on the Internet and traveled from all parts of the country to meet in person for the first time.  And then, just like last year in that uncomfortable conversation, I thought: “Oprah?  Hey, why not.  It’s great exposure.”

Six years later, Oprah finally featured some of the most prominent and iconic mom bloggers – women who’ve met a bunch of other women on the Internet and traveled from all parts of the country to get drunk together meet each other.  Now that she’s done that, I’ve got some concrete reasons why I don’t like her.

1. The show’s title was “Secret Lives of Moms”. These women are bloggers.  They write in the most public forum of all, the Internet.  There’s nothing secret about what they’re putting out there.  Furthermore, that title sounds awfully salacious, as if mom bloggers are all spiking our OJ with vodka – though in Heather’s case it would be bourbon, and Stefanie would drink hers from a sippy cup. 2. The first line of the show’s description was “Moms across America boldly break their silence about motherhood!” Moms all over the world – not just America – are blogging, as Catherine and David’s project has illustrated well; Catherine herself lives in Canada.  While our blogging voices are being increasingly heard (be they bold or tentative), the silence was broken a long time ago (certainly not by a single episode of Oprah), because we – and our mothers and grandmothers before us (hello, suffrage) – have been speaking all along.  We’ve simply expanded the discussion to include new media."
This may sound silly, but when was the last time you looked in the mirror at yourself and said, “I love you.”

What is mirror work?   It’s when you face yourself in the mirror, look into your eyes, and say affirmations to yourself.

Louise Hay, in “You Can Heal Your Life,” clearly describes this simple process.   She helps you gain back your personal power by looking in the mirror and saying “I Love You (put in your name).”   This simple affirmation can have profound affect on your well-being.   ’m sitting on the bus writing, my words barely legible from the jerky motion as the bus travels over the New York City roads.  I have an hour-long trip each way into the City (at least) and I do use this time to do many things.  I catch up with emails on my blackberry, read and even talk on the phone (which is somewhat rude when the bus is quiet and people are relaxing).  

Yet, this is a prime time to write.    I’m constantly saying I want time to write…here it is. 
Today is Valentine’s Day and immediately I thought of people I love.   How can I let them know they are important and special in my life?   Then I thought, “what about me?”  How do I show myself that I love “me” and I’m special in my life?

What flashed in my mind immediately is that I’m tolerating too much in my life.   How do I know that I’m tolerating “stuff?” I can tell by listening to my internal thoughts of frustrations or the complaints that I express to others.
Have you ever watched the Animal Planet show Lemur Kingdom? Seen the children’s movie Madagascar? Or the show Zoboomafoo? Then you’ll know what a ring-tailed lemur is. Lemurs are so adoraale and enigmatic that they are a great way to bring wildlife conservation to children, and parents, and the greater world. Here's the  sweetest story about a 10-month old baby ring-tailed lemur who broke her femur and had to have surgery. She's recovering nicely. Peanut lives at the Summer Wind Farms Sanctuary in Michigan, and snagged her leg on a branch while bouncing through the treetops, as primates tend to do. It snapped.  The family-owned Sanctuary staff knew that without surgery, Peanut had little chance for a normal lemur life, since these primates spend the majority of their time in the treetops. So they brought Peanut to the Michigan Veterinary Specialists, a specialty and emergency care vet hospital which did the surgery and care at a reduced fee. These vets also occasionally do work for the Detroit Zoo, but specialize in cats and dogs. Poor little Peanut had to be separated from her mom during the surgery, which took an hour and a half.  During the operation, veterinary surgeon Dr. Jennifer Covey placed a steel plate and screws in Peanut’s femur. "Peanut's surgery was the first of its kind for me," explains Covey. "I certainly enjoy working with wildlife but I am not a specialist in them. I consulted with two zoo/exotics veterinarians to determine the best anesthesia protocol for Peanut as well as look for any metabolic disturbances that may have contributed to her breaking her leg. Lemurs can be prone to having soft bones if they aren't exposed to enough sunlight or are not fed a diet specific for primates. Based upon xrays and bloodwork we were able to determine that she didn't have soft bones (aka Rickets)." Before long, surgery was complete and Peanut started coming out of anesthesia. They had a comfy cage for her complete with a stuffed animal! She was on the path to recovery. It will take around 8 weeks for Peanut to get completely back to normal. Lemurs are an ancient group of primates that live only on the island of Madagascar off the west coast of Africa.  The group is quite variable, with the 99 known species ranging in size from the diminutive mouse lemur to the Indri. Because of rampant deforestation on Madagascar many lemurs have declined throughout their already limited range. Ring-tailed lemurs are endangered species. Though protected internationally, being endangered can mean they’re in greater demand for the illegal pet trade. The Sanctuary provides a refuge for animals retired from the movie industry or exotic pets whose owners have become unable to care for, including bears, tigers, monkeys and more. The family-owned Sanctuary provides food and refuge for over 200 animals so they can live their days in peace on their 140-acres.  Because of their anadromous natural history, wild salmon don’t stand a chance against gigantic hydroelectric dams placed smack dab across the rivers and creeks in which they have spawned in for millennia.
As the foreign arthouse market continues to shrink abroad, the Unifrance-sponsored Rendez-Vous With French Cinema in New York is strengthening its role as a launchpad for French pics' distribution in the U.S.

Since its inception in 1995, the French love fest in New York has helped foreign sales agents get their films some exposure, network with U.S. distribs and eventually ink deals. In today's shifting specialty market, the Gallic promo org is also encouraging U.S. distribs to source their films earlier and use the fest to expand marketing dollars.

This year, seven of the 18 pics unspooling at the event already have been nabbed for U.S. distribution, including spy spoof "OSS 117: Lost in Rio" to Ed Arentz's Music Box; Christophe Honore's "Making Plans for Lena" to IFC Films ; and Stephane Brize's "Mademoiselle Chambon" and war drama "The Army of Crime" to Lorber Films.

"With P&A (costs) skyrocketing and commercial cinema chains squeezing out arthouse films, alternative exhibition venues like the Rendez-Vous have become key in giving foreign films a good degree of exposure," says Kino Lorber co-prexy Richard Lorber.

IFC Films acquisitions VP Arianna Bocco agrees, noting the company launched Cedric Klapisch's "Paris" two years ago at the Rendez-Vous and picked up Gerard Depardieu starrer "Bellamy" off last year's.

"The Rendez-Vous has a twofold purpose," she explains. "It's a great platform to test your film before an audience and get a critical response, and it's a good place for acquisitions because we get to see films we haven't seen before."

But Gallic sales execs worry about the contraction of the U.S. specialty market.

"Currently, the U.S. distribution landscape is made up of three basic layers," observes Eric Lagesse, president of Paris-based shingle Pyramide. "At the bottom, you have a dozen small independent companies, like Strand Releasing, Kino Lorber and Music Box; then you have medium-size structures like IFC Films and Magnolia; and that leaves Sony Pictures Classics on top with the monopoly of big films."

"For the past two years, we've had to learn to be more creative to compensate for the falling minimum guarantees," says Cecile Gaget, sales topper at Gaumont, which reps "OSS 117." "We negotiate for good backends."

But even if theatrical advance offers have been shrinking, "a theatrical release in the U.S. is more crucial than ever to our filmmakers," says Harold Van Lier, international sales topper for StudioCanal.

"That prestigious recognition confirms that their film travels well," he adds, "which usually sparks additional releases abroad."
Incorporating common genetic risk factors into the models typically used to calculate a women's breast cancer risk has little impact on clinical decision-making, such as whether an individual should consider earlier or more frequent mammography or prophylactic drugs, according to a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results follow similar studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, echoing what has now become a common criticism of genome-wide association studies; that this approach is unlikely to identify genetic risk factors of diagnostic value.

Over the last few years, researchers have used DNA-studded microarrays to quickly search tens of thousands of human genomes for common genetic variations linked to various diseases, dubbed genome-wide association studies. Despite the enormous size of these studies, they have only identified a fraction of the source of the genetic risk of disease. And the vast majority account for a very small change in risk in a given individual. (This is in contrast to rare genetic variants, like BRCA1, which substantially increase a women's risk of developing breast cancer.)
I wasn’t expecting to find a tempest in a stockpot in Crimea, where I recently spent a month covering a story on that part of southern Ukraine. But that’s what happened when I met Galina Onischenko, a devoutly pro-Russian citizen of Sevastopol. Galina invited me over for lunch at her fifth-floor walk-up apartment and served borscht. Even before my spoon hit the soup, she wanted me to know that her borscht was Russian. Her tone implied that borscht from any other Slavic country was not even worth mentioning. There are no political boundaries when it comes to recipes, but no surprise, either, to food being a sticking point (dare we say a flashpoint in a pan?) for nationalist rivalries and tension. Think of the culinary kafuffle of 2003 when U.S. conservatives renamed French fries “freedom fries” to express anti-French sentiment during international debate over the launch of the Iraq invasion. And so it is with borscht. Just ask Galina. “Borscht,” says Anya von Bremzen, author of Please to the Table: The Russian Cookbook, “is adapted and sometimes even claimed by Russians, Polish, Lithuanian, Moldovans, but it’s actually from Ukraine.” Ukrainian borscht has pork fat in it, the infamous salo that is practically a patriotic birthright, whereas borscht from Moldova is made with fermented beets, and borscht in Belarus is given its kick by tomatoes. “In Slavic countries, borscht is a part of everyone’s life,” she says. Sometimes too much. For those, like von Bremzen, who endured the privation of Soviet Russia, where the sighting of a banana was a major event and borscht the dreary, greasy, institutional constant in schools and workplace cafeterias, “you almost can’t stand to see it.” Borscht can bring passions to a boil even within the borders of one country. James Meek in the Guardian reports an Internet forum exchange between western and eastern Ukrainian borschtophiles over the question of beets. When “Leena” from western Ukraine posted a comment saying that her eastern Ukrainian grandmother made borscht without beetroot, “Charlie” berated her for slandering eastern Ukraine. “Oh, western Ukraine. Always ready to accuse eastern Ukraine of any cardinal sin,” he wrote. “Borscht without beetroot?Borscht can bring passions to a boil even within the borders of one country.

Always ready to accuse eastern Ukraine of any cardinal sin,” he wrote. “Borscht without beetroot? How could you make up such a thing?” How indeed? After all, the word borscht comes from the Ukrainian word борщ, which means beet, though there is a Polish “white” borscht, called zarek, traditionally served at Easter, from which beets are unaccountably missing. Whatever its lineage, let me tell you there is nothing like a fragrant, steaming bowl of borscht to soothe the soul and nourish the body. Now, pay attention: Galina says the secret of borscht is in the chopping. You must dice the vegetables into very small cubes, say, the size of a fingernail. She is adamant about this. “You cannot be lazy.”
After work, I met Cathy and the rest of the ridesharers for a quick jaunt to Montreal in the back of Cathy's black Suzuki SUV.

As soon as I got there, I called Marilyn, when I meant to call Marc-Andre. I had a mission to find some chocolate that had been left there for me by a couchsurfer of mine.

She cancelled on me, felt bad, so she left some chocolate for me to pick up.

Long story short, I never found the chocolate. Marilyn was home, and I sat waiting for the bus to her house for at least 45 minutes.

That was OK, because then I left with some French girls to go drink a beer before heading off to Boston.

We had a nice time, and then I walked to the bus station to catch my bus.

I tried to sleep all the way to Boston, but I couldn't because a man from Vermont sat beside me and SQUISHED various parts of my body as he tried to get comfortable using my arm and leg as a pillow. Nevertheless, I finally got to Boston at about 8 a.m., then I got changed, and made my way to Smarter Travel.

I had an interesting meeting people at the office, I brought some maple toffee and they seemed to enjoy it.

I met up with Ed Passarella to talk about perhaps switching jobs, although nothing was available just yet, I think he was happy I visited anyway.

There might be something interesting for me to do in the future though, stay tuned. It was Graham's idea to do a travel gadget exchange, and the ladies at STM found this out, so they kitted me out with a giant box of travel gadget crap to give away. They were more than happy to part with it.

There were a bunch of seat cushions, lots of pointless plastic stuff that hopefully people would at least laugh at. 

And they did.

I was pooped and WAY too early so I kind of passed out at a table. A very blue-collar-obviously-just-finished-work kinda guy was eating pizza and after he finished he came over and asked me what was in the box.

"Oh it's just junk I'm giving away to people when they come."

"What are ya sellin' somethin'?!"
First, I got married. Then I had a baby. And now! NOW I'M TAKING CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS! Where is the dooce you used to know and love! I had blood work done last week while getting a second x-ray on my tailbone, and today the results came back normal. Good news on top of the fact that my tailbone seems to be healing according to the    x-ray. When I asked the doctor if it would be okay to travel again with this... this... broken butt? Isn't that what it is, really? I broke my butt. There's no getting around this. Not with Leta walking around going, "When is mom's butt going to get better?" WHEN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT IT OUT LOUD. IN THE HALLWAY. AT SCHOOL. The doctor said to take my butt pillow with me, and I'd be fine. Also, just curious, she was. What did I do for a living since I travel this much? Now, picture this, okay. She has just inspected me, taken a look at The Smallest Butt In The History Of The Universe, and this conversation is inevitably going to result in, "Oh, my friend told me about you. You're that woman?" So before I told her, I said, um, the size of my  butt falls under doctor/patient privilege, right? The Hippocratic Oath? And she was all, I will take knowledge of your tiny butt TO THE GRAVE. Thank God no one will know about it now. Anyway, I had to make an emergency appointment with my dentist this morning because one of the teeth on the right side of my mouth is making it so that I cannot chew food: the shooting, lightening-patterned pain! Straight up through my jaw, up into my eye, and bang into my forehead. And when my dentist sat down and asked what was going on, I was all, I'M FALLING APART! You think I'm kidding, but the odds are that you'll lean over to take a look inside my mouth and suddenly my head will topple off right into your lap! An x-ray and twenty minutes of prodding and hammering away proved that it has to be a sinus infection. It's just that a certain nerve in a certain tooth sits inside my sinus cavity. Are you serious? It has nothing to do with my bones? I was prepared for surgery, and you're giving me a prescription for an antibiotic? How can I possibly write about this in all caps, SIR?! I can't go back to the people with a sinus infection! They want DISEASE! They want LIFE-EXPECTANCY! Can I at least tell them you prescribed a cane? Because, let's be honest. I have an image to uphold. So far, so good I've recently made friends with a lovely woman up the street who kindly took pity on me when she noticed that I spend my entire day with my husband. Not that Jon is difficult to live or work with. He is my soul mate and best friend.
An international team of astronomers has discovered an exoplanet--one outside our solar system--that has a more Earthlike orbit than any alien planet discovered so far using the same technique. The planet, called CoRot-9b, was discovered by the French-operated satellite CoRot, which has been in orbit since 2006. The spacecraft detected CoRot-9b by measuring the dimming of its star's brightness as the planet passed in front of it, a technique called "transit observation." The small dip in brightness allows the planet's size to be calculated. By measuring the amount of time it takes the planet to complete its orbit, researchers can determine the planet's distance from its star. The planet travels around its star every 95 Earth days, at a distance about half of that between Earth and the sun. This distance is still 10 times farther than any other planet discovered using this method. Its surface temperature is between -23 and 157 °C, so if CoRoT-9b was a terrestrial planet like Earth it could have liquid water on its surface, but it is made mostly of hydrogen and helium and therefore is unlikely to support life.
Just a quick post to let you all know that I'm having a fabulous time in LA! The weather is wonderful, the people are so friendly and down to earth, and the shopping is to die for! I've been to so many amazing places and I still have two more days left! The photo above was taken while we were driving along Beverly Boulevard on route to lunch at The Polo Lounge, the best old school place in LA! I can't wait to share more with you when I get back! I definitely love LA!  Since I'm off to LaLa Land, I thought I'd take this time to post some great Los Angeles homes. This one belongs to the chic married couple Michael Govan and Katherine Ross and family. He's the Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and she has worked in public relations for LVMH. Not sure if she's still with them but regardless, this is one fashionable family! When they moved to LA, they wanted a Richard Neutra house but has clearly made due with this lovely home filled with their art collection as well as pieces borrowed from the museum. When I think of California design, I often think of mid-century modern furniture and I love all the bright colors they used for their pieces. It's a pop art paradise! Enjoy!
The Spaniards know how to deal with criminals and terrorists. Every country should consider their methods of arresting these reprobates. Here's one for a laugh. The latest Rap Group - The Wolverines - have come out with "O.T.P." (One Term President. They're young, which is great, and although I am not fond of rap, the song is actually quite catchy. There's even a cameo by Bob Parks from Black and Right. The latest from Zack, over at Diversity Lane, says it all re. the Dems and their herculean efforts to to ram their health care through, come hell or high water. At this point, it's just a question of getting their way, and nothing more. There are many in this world who would be more than willing to wipe Israel off the map. You've got the Palestinians, Ahmadinejad and probably most inhabitants in the Middle East. Then you have the usual Israel bashing, boycotting, liberal types, and the neo-nazi yo-yos who would be just as happy if someone like Ahmadinejad were to accomplish that goal. Palestinians have wiped Israel off the map, figuratively speaking, by literally creating maps sans Israel. And it looks like Target Stores did the same thing, when they manufactured a $1.00 made-in-China miniature globe with Palestine clearly written, but no 'Israel' anywhere to be found. Target denies any ill intent by omitting 'Israel', and did yank them off their shelves, only after many people complained. I'm not sure what Target was thinking when they made that choice, and perhaps they should have abbreviated both countries, or omitted both, but I can't believe they thought they could get away with that.
or so my recent experiences would demonstrate. The awful stereotypes that rotate through our culture that women are emotional, dramatic and needy while men are jerks who just want sex and space fall apart when we shift overall power dynamics.

Let me explain.

Scenario: Being that I’ve settled into a new place and am in a good place in my life, I decided that dating would probably be a good idea. However, I spend most of my ‘going out’ time with mostly men and a few women from the technology scene. This makes it difficult to find time to go out on my own and meet people outside of my field (people who I can casually date without rumors flying around). So, I turned to what most modern singles turn to in our day and age: online dating. I looked at a few sites, but they just seemed so cheesy until I came across OKCupid, a hip and fun site that is also without those awful ’sign up for 3 months to be able to talk to anyone and give us all of your information while you are at it’ caveats.

This was in October. Then I got really busy with travel and work so I didn’t check in for a long time. While I was offline, I had a few messages that I missed and that sort of thing, but a few of them had me baffled. I logged onto find a couple of threads where I got not one, but multiple messages from the same men. They started out sweet and chatty, moved into ‘Hello? Hello?’ territory fairly quickly, then spiraled into crazy, dramatic, “Listen here you snotty beotch…you think you are better than me?” depths within a couple of days. Okay, so I could dismiss these threads as troll-like online behavior.
Last night I interviewed Gerri Detweiler, Ultimate Credit on Reduce Debt, Reduce Stress. WOW! Gerri's a wealth of knowledge. I've never been comfortable referring people to credit counseling organizations. Did you know that the Department of Justice maintains a list of credit counseling organizations? Visit www.justice.gov and search Credit Counseling Agencies. According to Gerri the first consultation with a credit counseling agency does not affect your credit score and it's usually free.

If you're struggling with debt use this simple calculation to determine if you can pay it off without help. Begin by totaling your minimum credit card payment on all your credit cards. Let's say you owe $1,000 per month on 5 credit cards -- multiply $1,000 by 20% = $1,200. If you have $1,200 available each month you should be able to pay your credit card debt off in 3 - 5 years. According to Gerri, the next step is to pay the minimum payment on all accounts except the account with the highest interest rate. Pay all the remaining money on that account until it's paid off. Move to the next account. This is called snowball method. Check out www.zilchworks.com -- an online calculator recommended by Gerri Detweiler. They offer a free trial service.
Michelle "Bombshell" McGee is the latest unchaste woman to destroy a high-profile marriage. She didn't do it for love or even lust, she did it for fame and a payday.

Sources close to the "tattoo model" revealed exclusively to Technorati, that McGee, mother of two, was paid close to $30,000 for her story about the alleged affair between her and West Coast Choppers CEO and hubby to Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. Our source tells us McGee was fully aware that Sandra and Jesse were still together when she began the affair, and was hoping the affair would be her ticket to "mainstream celebrity."  Mainstream infamy is more like it.

McGee, who claims to have been brought up Amish, says she left the church and her family at the age of 16 and moved to California where she began a life as a tattoo model. McGee, who has too many tattoos to count covering at least 70% of her body, including her face, approached James about modeling for his well-known company. She claims Jesse emailed her and told her to correspond with him at his private email. The two met at his garage and it was then they began their intimate relationship, which she states lasted 11 months.

There's even more disturbing news in this story which alleges James texted her as recently as March 14, just days after his wife's incredible Oscar win for Best Actress. Bullock, who has publicly and privately support her husband and his bid to win full custody of his youngest daughter Sunny, must be incredibly hurt and devastated to find out he was intimate with another woman. A woman who has an uncanny likeness to the same ex-wife he left for her drug use and volatility.
This is Karen's Heidi -- isn't it fabulous? I really, really love that fabric. You can read her review, here, on PatternReview. (You may need to log in, but a basic PatternReview membership is free, and if you haven't signed up already you really should -- it's fantastic for research!)

I ran across Karen's version while I was doing a quick check to see what kinds of variations on the BurdaStyle Heidi have been showing up. There's Burda's own Prom Variation, of course, but I haven't seen very many other ones. Possibly because the Heidi is VERY CLOSE to perfect as is, but I've been thinking that I'd like to make it in more lightweight fabrics, as summer comes on (here in the Northern Hemisphere, at least).

The Heidi I linked to before is made in Liberty Tana lawn ... but I'm wondering how the fairly narrow Heidi skirt works in a lightweight fabric. I'm worried it would ride up. So I was thinking I might double the width of the center front skirt panel and add a couple inches to the middle of the back of the skirt, which could then be gathered to make a slightly more summery and playful skirt.

I suppose the right answer is "line it, you dummy," but I haven't had much luck with lined skirts. Your thoughts?

On Anna's recommendation, I bought a copy of The Sewing Machine Attachment Handbook, which turns out to have been the book I've been looking for all my sewing life. Did your sewing machine come with a box of tiny, weirdly-shaped feet? Then you need this book. There are clear instructions for guides, hemmers, rufflers, binding and cording feet, sequin feet, walking feet ... and on and on. If you can screw, bolt, strap or clip it to your sewing machine, I think this book covers it.

My favorite guideline for judging sewing books is by whether or not they make you want to sew -- and this book makes me really, really want to sew. I think the hemming foot instructions alone are going to make my sewing life better.

It's also kindled in me a deep and painful longing for something called a "bias cutting guide" -- a doodad that clips to the end of your scissors so that you can cut bias tape without all that painful marking. I wants one, I do. Couldn't turn one up on eBay, though; does anyone have any leads?

(Also, if you buy it from the link above, the author, Charlene Phillips, will sign your copy. That's always nice!)

Under Creative Commons License: Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike  Am I excited about the Liberty for Target line? Insert all questions you've ever heard about Popes and bears here. Yes, I am excited.

I'm a bit more excited about the accessories and some of the housewares than I am about the clothes, because many years of trial and error have shown me that stuff from Target simply Does Not Fit Me, but I have purchased several little things (e.g., the girls' dresses, in size XL, have a surprising amount of fabric) with big plans for remaking them into something else.

I'm a little disappointed that most of the prints are florals, even though I know that's what people associate with Liberty. I was hoping for more of my favorite abstracts (although there are some things in the Cars and the Mark prints, both of which I love).

The women's clothing was the most disappointing -- not the best prints, and almost all made in that scruffy poly-chiffon. Good thing the accessories are all so cute (and cotton).

(Speaking of Liberty, I also bought the bright bright bright pink "Petals and Peacocks" lipstick from the MAC Liberty collaboration, and I think I will actually wear it. It's really fun, and the packaging is spectacular, natch.)

Did you rush your local Target last Sunday? What did you buy, if anything?

Happy Spring Equinox everyone! It's a beautiful day here in NY -- the sun is shining brightly, there's a light breeze blowing through, and hibernating flowers are just starting to poke their way up from the softened earth. I feel like cartwheeling on the grass, lying on the ground with the face turned toward the sun, and dancing to my own music. Yep, spring fever has hit me!

Last night I was lucky enough to witness an amazing performance of Tao: The Martial Art of Drumming. The performance was brilliant, electric, mesmerizing, mind-blowing and I'm still riding high from the energetic burst that I got from the performance. If you're not familiar with Taiko drumming, check out this video of a Tao performance: Not only was the performance music to my ears (literally) but it was also a feast for sight and feeling. The synchronized movements of the drummers kept me mesmerized and the beat reverberating through the auditorium and my body kept me literally humming with energy. 

That's what spring feels like to me -- everything is alive, a feast for the senses.

Yet so often we hold back aliveness for fear of feeling good. Think about yoga practices gone stale -- a practitioner pushes him/herself until the practice no longer feels good but is a routine without engagement of the senses.
I have lived in Japan for 8 months.

EIGHT MONTHS!

At times, this is unbelievable. I still feel like a newbie. A guest. and somehow, i think, i will always feel this way. in fact, i accept that this status will not change. being a guest, does have its priviledges.

In everyday life, i have become pretty independent. I can shop, dine, carry out simple bank, postal, phone transactions without a problem. Yet. I will always be dependent on others. and maybe, just maybe, that might be a good thing. This way, i get to interact with others more.

While I think i have grown as a person, this has somewhat plateau-ed and I have reverted back to some of my bad habits. I sleep no earlier than 12 these days, i watch more dramas than before, i procrastinate- ALOT.

The trip back to Singapore has made me re-evaluate my priorities. Its prompt interruption of my routine has made me take a step back and think, once more, of why I am here. and why i want to stay one more year. Going back made me realise that time and tide waits for no man. Everyone had changed, just a little, if not in personality then in circumstances, in relationships, in dressing, in habits. I have changed too. but is it for the better?

So on the plane back, I thought about it. It didn’t have to be amazing acheivements. It just had to be something I would follow through with. and i came up with these

1) Learn enough Japanese (at least up to JLPT 3)
2) Update my blog
3) Upload my photos
4) Be myself. Don’t accommodate too much
5) Cook more interesting food (and not so frequently)
6) Exercise more
7) Sleep by 11
8) Make more friends
9) Take more pictures
10) Think about my future
This is the best epilator I have come across with. I love it! I have quite some facial hair and I use it on my sideburns and under my chin. Ive had it since I was 11 when it first came out and it has never bailed on me. I am looking for one of these epilators too and everywhere I look says 'currently unavailable'. What idiot company would run out of such a popular shaver?? Doesn't say much about philips/norelco does it. Please if someone knows where to find one, please let me know I have had this epilator years one of the best products i have ever brought.It does hurt a LITTLE for the first couple of times.I dropped mine on the floor and broke the on off switch even though it still works i would like to replace it with the same one or new model does anybody know where i can get one thanks..excellent investment. I have also had this product for a few years but need to replace it! I cant find this product anywhere so Im guessing there must be an upgrade to it or something with a different name, as I have seen loads of similar ones! Can anyone help me please? I love my HP6443, have had it for years and now I think it has decided its time is done. So, I want to buy an identical new one and cannot find anywhere to purchase it! Can anyone direct me? Thanks. I have been Epilating for 20 years. I have found this brand and product well worth it! It is pain at first but body adjusts and before you know it you are using it all over your body (stay away from face).
Argentina has just approved chemical castration for convicted rapists in the Mendoza province. The treatment must be voluntary, and because it’s a medication administered for the duration of their consent to treatment, it’s not permanent.

In the feminist community in particular, the debate over whether or not chemical castration should even be an option is still ongoing, but my initial reaction was: does anybody think this is actually going to work?! According to the CNN piece I linked above, there are 11 convicted rapists who will be undergoing treatment with a reduced sentence. It seems the hope is that if it’s successful in this province, it will be adopted in other provinces as well. But if the jury’s still out of how effective this is, how long do they intend to wait to deem it a success?  Last night, I had a scrumptious meal cooked by a good friend. Along with another friend, we sipped wine, busted out the Abbey Ale, and enjoyed the pleasure of each other’s company. And to make it a picture-perfect evening, we worked on our taxes.

Yes, it’s tax season here in the States and my friends and I turned what’s usually an annoyance into a fun night of food, drinks and good company.

For my friend, it was her first time filing taxes and we thought this would be a good way to promote financial independence. Hooray for sisterhood! We were able to coach her through the process and get her feeling more confident about being able to keep her finances in order. In fact, I think this dinner, drinks, taxes combo is a great one that I’ll be doing often! Any good cooks out there who need tax help? Or any awesome accountants in need of a yummy meal? I urge you all to start this tradition.
Hello :) Trusting you had a safe and happy Easter. I had a few relatively relaxed days, which was nice for a change. Got to the Easter Show which was good. Classic quote of the day came from Miss 7 as we were exiting one of the pavilions & she caught sight of a display. “Bricks? What’s so artistic about bricks?”. I laughed & explained they were fruit cakes (while imagining the wrath of dozens of scorned cake makers, for whom I daresay the competition would be a highlight of the year). The display looked something like this. Image courtesy of James O’Brien. The relaxed long weekend also gave me the opportunity to update my sadly neglected Top 100 list.  I just realised yesterday was the 2nd anniversary of my first attempt at a top 100 list. So there you go. You might notice a new little button in my sidebar. I’ve never been a fan of the whole donation, buy me a beer kinda thing, but Duncan suggested it & I figured “heh, why not?”. Maybe someone out there appreciates the time that goes into the list… So without further ado:Congratulations & thanks again for your suggestions of blogs that might be eligible. You know you’ve been out of the blogosphere for a while when….. you drop into Karen’s blog to see if she’s had any luck falling pregnant yet, only to find she’s not only been pregnant - but has actually had the baby! Congratulations :) And on the downside….. you venture to read one of your favourite bloggers & a Most Awesome Chick only to find out she’s had a minor stroke. Hugs Kelley & glad to hear you’re on the mend. Dear Mr Isherwood You know today I had a really crap day. I’m sure you couldn’t care less. At the end of a long, frustrating day the last thing someone feels like is fending off spam emails like the ones you are sending. I just received the sixth copy of the emailed press release entitled “Storm Financial a case for an Australian Pecora Commission”, and all were addressed to customised condolence email addresses (which are intended to convey condolence messages to the families of deceased people).  I have come to the conclusion that you are nothing but a two bit spammer amongst the ranks of sellers of pharmaceutical products I will never have the need for and replica watches I will never buy. Furthermore these email address could only have been obtained via raking (scraping email addresses from websites). Which indicates to me one of two things. Either you are buying crap email lists from a disreputable source and couldn’t care less, or you are engaging someone to obtain these on your behalf. Frankly, I don’t particularly care which - the net effect is the same. SPAM. I responded as such to the fifth email you sent, but I’m sure it will get lost amongst a sea of abuse.
When Mother’s Day came around, I was weakened by the day. I just couldn’t face my mother or Randa’s daughter. How do you comfort someone, when you need comforting yourself? I called my mother and apologized, but I was grateful to know my mother’s sister’s came from Ohio to spend the day with my mother. My mother still cries every time I see her. I can only imagine what my mother is going through.

Randa’s daughter Mattilyn, turned 7 in April, which is the same month as my birthday. Although my mother did have a birthday gathering with Matty’s friends, I went there to help my mother. It was a very sad day for my mother and me, because we tried hard all day to put our best face on for Matty. Matty’s birthday was considered a huge holiday for Randa. I think Randa thought it should have been declared a national holiday. Randa would immediately start thinking of Matty’s next birthday celebration after Matty’s birthday.

It was difficult on my birthday as well. My family and I agreed not to buy birthday gifts for each other, since our family was increasing. We decided we would only buy gifts for the children in the family, but not the adults. Randa didn’t agree to it, because every time our birthdays came around, Randa would still buy gifts, even though she lived on a minimal income. Randa’s heart was a giving one; that is my sister; that is my friend; that is the person I want to scream to the people that don’t know her.

Easter came around as well. Randa had so much faith. I believe she had more faith than my whole family did. She was a prayer warrior. I have not been back to Church since her disappearance. It’s not that I don’t believe anymore, but I had prayed for Randa the morning of her disappearance, before I had known she had disappeared. I just believe no matter how much you pray for someone, God is still going to allow things to happen anyway. I do know I still love Him, and I don’t want to live without faith, but I can’t understand this. I hear it all the time that everything happens for a reason, and it is always for the best, it is for something we need to learn, but you have to believe. I don’t know what I need to learn, but I do know whatever it is I need to learn, it is not worth the pain, it’s not worth losing my beautiful sister.

We celebrated Randa’s and Ghada’s birthday in June, by having a prayer vigil for Randa. That day just didn’t seem right, a day always meant to be celebrated, and was celebrated by a vigil. It was a good reason, to have the news media come, just to get my sister back in the news. Now we look for reason to get Randa back in the news. We have one billboard in Fenton, on the expressway, and hopefully we’ll have another one up on another expressway. It is the billboard that is still keeping the public aware my sister is still missing. As many times as we have posted and reposted flyers, people still bring them down. The billboard and flyers are difficult for my family and me to see. It feels like a stab in the heart every time we pass them, but it is something necessary when you have a missing loved one disappear.

Holidays are difficult. When someone you’ve loved your whole life is missing. My family and I have not celebrated anything. I don’t want to celebrate anything. I don’t ever want to take another family picture again, I just can’t do it. The prayer vigil for Randa was the first and last time my family has been together in one place. That was appropriate, I could handle that, but I can’t handle a family gathering right now with Randa still missing.

My favorite holiday memory that I have of Randa, is New Years Eve. We had a family member that had been struggling with drug addiction who was in rehab at the time. Randa and I dedicate that night to her, and said we would not drink any alcohol all evening. While everyone in club was drinking and acting stupid, Randa and I stuck to our plan, and had more fun than everyone else in the club. I think we were the only two straight people there. I miss her!!! Randa loved the holidays because she always looked forward for any reason our family would get together. She just loved hanging out with the family.

My favorite present that I had given Randa, and my favorite present Randa has given me, is the love that we had for each other. I love her so much. Randa is a beautiful jewel in the midst of our family. I have had a history of painful events within my lifetime, but if I added all my painful events that have happened in my lifetime, it would not equal to the pain of not knowing where Randa is, or what happened to my sister. This is different than anything I have ever experienced. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. Life still continues to go on. Sometimes I wish the world would just stop to catch my breath. I am still working; I just started to go back to school, which I was in the process of doing before Randa’s disappearance. I had to put it on the back burner for a while. I am trying to keep myself as busy as possible, I think being busy is good for me, but no matter how busy I may be, my sister is always on my mind and in everything I do. Sometimes I can do nothing but feel the pain of Randa missing. This is pain that is indescribable, I can’t explain it, I can only feel it.
With all due respect to it, conceptual art isn’t something I'm crazy about and that's why I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Maya Lin's exhibition at the Arts Club of Chicago, on view until April 23, 2010. Lin, an American artist and architect who explores landscape and geological phenomena, creates uncanny replicas of commonly known locations, such as Blue Lake Pass, wooden rock-like formations that recreate the Rocky Mountain pass. Although her art seems cool and impersonal upon first glance, once you spend a bit of time with it you can't help but be awed by her work.

Lin was awarded a doctorate from Yale and is best known for the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial in Washington, D.C, which she designed in 1982 while an undergraduate at Yale.

The work in the exhibition is a continuation of the artist's previous exhibitions. Lin's 1998 Topologies and the 2006-2009 Systematic Landscapes continue here.

When you think about the vantage point Lin is trying to express, the way computers and scientists view the landscape as circles and squares on satellite grid, the beauty she's imparting has a distinct purpose: to remind us of the importance of nature in our lives.

The interesting thing about Lin's work is that it seems hard and distant on the outside, but when you study it and reach and understanding about it, you warm up to it and become moved by it, to the point of wanting to escape the city to the nearest woods. This hard-shelled, but soft interior is the nature of Lin's art, and is a profound statement about the natural world. In order to become one with it you have to take careful note of it.
Kerry Taylor Auctions is having a bumper sale with over 300 lots, which opens with a collection of celebrity-owned dresses being auctioned by Topshop, in aid of the charities Help the Aged and Age Concern. The collection includes a wonderful Lanvin S/S 2003 cocktail dress from Kate Moss and a beautiful siren gown by Zac Posen, worn by Erin O'Connor, as well as others from Scarlett Johannson and Dita von Teese, and dresses by exciting young designers like Christopher Kane and Danielle Scutt. The rest of the sale covers every decade from the 18th century to the 1990s, and includes dozens of beaded flapper dresses, a stylish 1960s Balenciaga coat, and Thierry Mugler suits from 1980s. The fashion is accompanied by wonderful accessories, including twenties shoes, Hermes handbags, embroidered samplers, boxes of trimmings and much more. I didn't want to be all tacky and blatantly show off my inventory while still mending a broken heart left by the breathtaking McQueen collection, but... Alexander McQueen's last collection was shown this week. As only McQueen could, his final show is rich in opulent fabrics, trim, rooted in history, and yet unlike anything we have seen before. Alexander McQueen was one of the only designers that appealed to my eclectic, and often disjointed style preference. He was the master of edgy couture, luxe punk rock, and yet had the craftsmanship to make clothing that made you think "Yea, I can wear that." In his final collection, you see his use of luxury fabrics and trim - satin, gold embroidery  - done in a new an unexpected way, yet obviously influenced by ancient history. How many modern designers can be described that way? I wanted to share a few of my favorite pieces...
"What the music industry didn’t expect was that Lenz would fight back so rather than think “What is the PR value involved here?” it decided to fight dirty.

    It tried a novel attack strategy. It said that even if the music was used legally, it was also infringing at the same time. Why? Well, because the song was copyrighted and owned by Universal. It tried to claim that its own DMCA notice was not legitimate. It attacked Lenz’s counsel, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for daring to help her to defend the case. Universal also said Lenz had “unclean hands” for making supposedly false allegations in her lawsuit.

    US District Judge Jeremy Fogel finally had enough of the music industry’s bizarre antics and granted partial summary judgement. He didn’t award Lenz damages but has opened the way for her lawyers to get her attorneys’ fees from her initial case against the bogus takedown.

This article at Business Insider has some more information about what the PSJ means, for the sake of clarity. I also read a blog entry this weekend that implied my only “damage” was that I was “slightly annoyed” when my video was removed. That’s so…

Actually you know what it is? Slightly annoying. Yes. That’s “slightly annoying” on my “annoying” scale. Impinging my First Amendment rights, accusing me of being a copyright infringer… that’s somewhat higher on my “annoying” scale.

BTW: As I write this, the hit count on the video is 954,662 views. When it was flagged for removal, the views were 273. Astounding. Pink Floyd signed with EMI in 1967 and their contract “contained a clause to ‘preserve the artistic integrity of the albums.’” What does this mean forty years later? That you won’t be able to buy their concept albums a song at a time, which EMI wanted to offer via iTunes, Amazon and other music-buying sites.

As the BBC says: “The band largely avoided releasing singles during their career, instead preferring fans to listen to entire albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, which has sold more than 35 million copies around the world.”

    The issue of selling individual tracks online has been a thorny one for many artists, who want their albums to be seen as complete works. Bands also receive less money if fans pick and choose tracks instead of buying a full suite of songs. When I think of certain albums, I think of them as whole pieces, not as individual songs (Tommy, Abbey Road, Dark Side of The Moon, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Nebraska, American Idiot, etc.). For these, when I put them on, I play them straight through. Putting these albums on shuffle illustrates how essential song order and coherence are to the concept album (as well as the concept of “album”). Of course I like buying songs a la carte and we own a lot of songs that we would never have purchased an album to get b/c the rest of the album is crap. I used to call it “single-filler” in the 80s when I judged whether it was worth my $8 to buy

Ever heard the phrases, “standing on principle” or, “following principles,” or “adhering to principles?”  Have you considered that how you run your business is based on your idea of  business principles?  And have you considered that you are the architect of the principles upon which your business is built?

Most businesses of more than 10 employees have organizational charts, documents of policies and procedures and other ways of determining what their principles are upon which they run their enterprises.  The tiny business owner, the solo-preneur, rarely gives this much thought.  Some tiny businesses get born by a good idea and launched into activity without even a written business plan.   However, I’ve said it before – if you haven’t set a destination and know how you’ll get there, you’ll only run in circles.  Principles are important.

At its most basic, what is a business principle?  A principle?  Principles are those things and elements that represent what is desirable and positive for a business to do and they provide forward momentum.  Although principles hold within themselves policy, goals and objectives, they are actually more elemental and are meant to be the baseline governing factor in all manner of doing and operating your business.

Principles have within them the elements of norms, rules and values and these elements all have to be defined and determined individually for each business.

Norms are the “what is normal” guidelines for operations.  Kind of the “the way we’ve always done things;” the comfortable and the known.  Norms are the guidelines or practices you set down.  For example, you send out invoices on the 15th of every month – this is a norm for the accounts receivable function of your business.   You review your business plan on a quarterly basis…this is a normal function for your leadership role.
5 Recruiting Tricks of the Trade
 
Amidst wide-spread cuts to company budgets, headcount and resources, recruiters nowadays are pressed to take on more and more with less and less. Current market conditions have created new challenges for recruiters across all industries. Recruiting strategies and sources that may have proven effective in prior years are now antiquated and less productive. The need to be cost-efficient without cutting corners and sacrificing quality of hires is a skill recruiters across the spectrum are having to master. 
 
For most of 2009, I spent more time assessing and re-assessing the effectiveness of our overall recruiting strategy at Esurance, while ensuring that not a penny over what’s necessary is spent. I’m sure this hits home for many of you who either lead talent acquisition teams or play a vital part in identifying talent for your organizations. During the course of these re-assessments, I came up with the following creative ways to do more with less.  
 
Staff Re-alignment & Re-evaluation of Best Practices
 
The past year provided numerous challenges as Esurance tightened its belt and worked to optimize efficiency across all departments. With some relatively simple maneuvering and fluid communication with our business leaders, we moved from a regional recruiting model to a business specialization model. The team’s workload was stretched, and we were able to support a larger, broader customer base. A re-alignment and streamlining of tasks immediately followed and each recruiter now provides their internal client groups with end-to-end (full life cycle) recruiting support. This has led to faster cycle times or an average time to fill of 23 days for Esurance as a whole. 
 
Job Boards
 
Undoubtedly, this is the most cost-consuming part of my budget. While the overall effectiveness of job boards in general is questionable in the age of social networking and talent communities, it still remains a key part of our recruitment strategy. But what do you do when you need to fill a specific or technically niche position(s) due to unanticipated turnover and have little to no more money to spend? This is where “out of the box” thinking is crucial.  
 
Explore options with your Account Manager to see if unused job postings can be exchanged for other services– such as name-generation lists, source and screen, inmail or targeted email campaigns– which enable you to reach applicants with the specific experience you’re looking for without having to dig deep in your pocket.

Biomass can be converted to fuels via a process called gasification, which uses high temperatures to break feedstock down into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can then be made into various fuels, including hydrocarbons. But there's a major drawback--about half of the carbon in the biomass gets converted to carbon dioxide rather than into carbon monoxide, a precursor for fuels. Now researchers in University of Minnesota and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, have developed a method for gasifying biomass that converts all of the carbon into carbon monoxide. In the new approach, the researchers gasify biomass in the presence of precisely controlled amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, the main component of natural gas, in a special catalytic reactor that the researchers developed. When they did this, all of the carbon in both the biomass and the methane was converted to carbon monoxide. "In the chemical industry, even a few percent improvement makes a big impact. The increase from 50 percent to 100 percent is profound," says Dionisios Vlachos, the director of the Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation at the University of Delaware.  To increase the yields from gasification, researchers at the University of Minnesota and UMass Amherst added carbon dioxide, which promotes a well-known reaction: the carbon dioxide combines with hydrogen to produce water and carbon monoxide. But adding carbon dioxide isn't enough to convert all of the carbon in biomass into carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide. It's also necessary to add hydrogen, which helps in part by providing the energy needed to drive the reactions. It's long been possible to do each of these steps in separate chemical reactors. The researchers' innovation was to find a way to combine all of these reactions in a single reactor, the key to making the process affordable.
What a night. Berry became the first African-American woman to win the best actress Oscar and Washington became only the second African-American man to win best actor, after Poitier. Berry won for portraying an angry black woman with a husband on death row and a child so overweight she beat and chastised him before his death. Washington won for a playing a crooked, thuggish cop—but still, a new chapter in black history had begun: African-Americans were finally being recognized and awarded for their work in film.

A more diverse selection of "our stories" was sure to follow right?

Not so much.

This must be said: Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe gave wonderfully flawless performances in Precious, a touching but incredibly disturbing film about an overweight, young inner-city girl abused by her mother and molested by her father. They both deserved every nomination and award they received. Lee Daniels directed the film, as he has with many others, with the skill and compassion that guaranteed a best director nomination. My issue is not with them or any minority performer, save for being a part of only the stories Hollywood deems interesting enough to tell.

Defenders of the film have rebuffed the criticism of Precious. They argue that attacking its stereotypes and mainstream popularity is unfounded, given that the story is very much a reality in many inner-city African-American homes across the country. Unfortunately, it is a story that is all too familiar—but it's also one that's well known to all American households, thanks to its ubiquity in pop culture.
It’s easy to imagine Larry Keigwin choreographing a Beyoncé video, even if you didn’t know he got his start as a backup dancer on Club MTV. Please don’t mistake that for faint praise (who doesn’t love her “Single Ladies”?), only a nod to this witty stylist’s pop sensibilities. In the meantime Mr. Keigwin is fast making inroads on the concert dance circuit. On Tuesday night Keigwin & Company, formed in 2003, had its first solo week at the Joyce Theater, performing repertory works and a premiere before a full, enthusiastic house.

The new work, “Bird Watching,” shows Mr. Keigwin as engaged as ever in people watching. Preening and plumage aren’t just for the birds, and here five dancers, dressed in Fritz Masten’s glittery black-and-white costumes (figure skating comes to mind), strut and swoop to Haydn’s Symphony No. 6 in D.

The chandelier and cream-colored backdrop signal grandeur, as does Burke Wilmore’s buttery lighting. But these characters are surely nouveau riche, with their hip-jutting attitude and flashy jewels. In one of the most striking motifs they rapidly fan their ring-bearing hands in front of their faces, simultaneously coy and attention grabbing.

Mr. Keigwin’s mix of kinetic street energy and academic technique is always pleasing (as is his nonchalant inclusion of homosexuality, at a time when too much dance remains closeted onstage; a section in another work, “Mattress Suite,” is cheekily titled “Straight Duet”). But “Bird Watching” feels a bit dutiful to me, especially when followed by “Runaway” (2008), a nasty-edged world of mannequins and suits set to Jonathan Melville Pratt’s propulsive “Thirteen.”
At the start of Yasuko Yokoshi’s “Tyler Tyler,” a woman in a long, full skirt enters with slow, almost ritualistic pacing and places a tiny toy piano on the floor. A man (Kuniya Sawamura) in traditional costume kneels close to her and begins to move with subtle twistings and dippings of the upper body as she sings in Japanese. In the next scene, Ms. Yokoshi reverses that scenario: The man, Naoki Asaji, sits at the piano but sings the Carpenters’ “Yesterday Once More” as the woman (Julie Alexander) performs sweeping, dramatic runs and falls, her legs whipping up, skirt swirling. Kayvon Pourazar, in jeans and blue shirt, kneels, his contained hand gestures suggestive of a tea-drinking ceremony.

The game plan is clear: “Tyler Tyler,” which opened at Dance Theater Workshop on Wednesday night, will explore the conflation of traditional Japanese and contemporary Western dances and cultures. And Ms. Yokoshi maintains tight control of that objective as, with calculated slowness, she draws her audience ever closer to the opaque deliberations taking place onstage.

“Tyler Tyler” makes you notice the nuances of the traditional dance Kabuki Su-odori, which Ms. Yokoshi learned from the master teacher Masumi Seyama. It is revered for its purity and simplicity, performed without the facial makeup and dramatic gestures of traditional Kabuki.

The dance at first looks minimal; a matter of tiny, incremental shifts of position. Then you begin to see the smooth-as-silk wrists that twist and unfold their fans with purpose, the minute adjustments of posture and inclination, the hinted-at emotions, the perfect necessity of each gesture.

Against this, the contemporary dance passages — small, intent movements from Ms. Alexander and Mr. Pourazar (who also perform in the Su-odori style) — feel far more lightweight, even though the correspondences between the two forms are notable.

In the most theatrical passage, Ms. Yokoshi memorably fuses both elements as Mr. Asaji recites a passage from the 12th-century epic “The Tale of the Heike.”

There are parts of “Tyler Tyler,” which has been beautifully lighted by Ayumu (Poe) Saegusa, that feel less coherent. But all in all, the work is a considerable achievement that takes up residence in the memory and lingers, its details slowly becoming clearer, its mysteries more resonant.
Hello, ladies! It’s time for a surprise inspection for all our favorite Sunday shows! We’re dropping in to see how they’re managing without our weekly report. CJP likes to make sure women are well represented on the weekly shows. On with the inspection!

First Place:

Chris Matthews Show

Chris is keeping up the good work over on CMS. Chris Matthews hosted Janes Helene Cooper of the New York Times and Kelly O’Donnell of NBC news along with The Atlantic’s Andrew Sullivan and HDNet’s Dan Rather. Two of four is good enough for first place…Congratulations, CMS!

Second Place

Meet the Press

Meet the Press hosted California First Lady Maria Shriver, Senior White House Adviser Valerie Jarrett, Sen. Chris Dodd, Sen. John Kyl, and John Podesta, President and CEO of the Center for American Progress on this week’s show. Two Janes earns MTP a Jane and second place this week. Good job MTP!

Tied for Last Place

Fox News Sunday

Chris Wallace hosted Sen. Kent Conrad, Sen. Arlen Specter, Sen. John Thune, Terry McAuliffe former Chair of the Democratic Party and Karl Rove former Senior Adviser to President George W. Bush. Not a Jane in the bunch so that puts Chris and FNS in last place.  

This Week

George Stephanopolous hosted White House Senior Adviser David Axelrod. Not a Jane but we will give George a little credit for at least including one Jane in his roundtable panel.

Face the Nation

Bob Scheiffer hosted White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, Sen. John Cornyn, and Sen. John Kerry on Sunday morning. As most of you know, we at CJP are very fond of Bob and consider him our Sunday boyfriend. Needless to say, we’re disappointed, Bob.
At a time when our political and financial landscapes are littered with villains and those unwilling to take them on, it's refreshing to find someone in the halls of power that we can unabashedly celebrate.

Enter Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware. Kaufman, Joe Biden's longtime chief of staff who was appointed to serve out his old boss's term, was originally thought to be a Senate placeholder.

But, far from biding his time, Kaufman has emerged as one of the Senate's fiercest critics of Wall Street and a champion of the need to push for a serious rebooting of our financial system.

When I met with Kaufman earlier today in his small, basement "hideaway" in the Capitol ("it took Sen. Biden 15 years to get one of these; I was lucky to get one right away"), the first thing I wanted to know was what had inspired his transformation from behind-the-scenes staffer to fire-breathing accidental leader. Was there a Road to Damascus moment?

"In the beginning," he told me, "though I was very upset about what had happened on Wall Street, it wasn't one of my key objectives. In fact, the committees I got on were Foreign Affairs and Judiciary. But then I started reading more and more about the way the SEC was failing to curb abusive practices when it came to short selling. So I started speaking out on that... and the blogosphere really got involved, reporting what I was saying. Then people started reaching out to me: 'You think this is bad about short selling, you ought to take a look at this'... or 'you ought to take a look at that!' So we started getting all this information, and then checking it out with academics, folks from the industry, we just started building this whole repository of things that were still going on as if nothing bad had ever happened."
And on the record's best song, "In the Rushes", it comes after five minutes of tightly coiled build-up driven by sawing strings and Thorburn's choked, whispery warble, when the song explodes into major-key harmonies, galloping guitars, and sweetly twinkling glockenspiels.

Thorburn is an imaginative songwriter and his voice (both literally and figuratively) has always been unusual. Though he often overstuffs his compositions, sometimes that excess works to his advantage. Rambling opener "The Arm", which navigates terrain that's both spare and baroque, is better off for its sprawl. Its melody matures as it encompasses soaring strings, moments of prickly pizzicato and a welcome section of last-album levity that marries golden harmonies to bright polyrhythms. Islands are at their best when they are weird. And there is plenty of weirdness on Arm's Way-- like 11-minute, three-movement album closer, "Vertigo (If It's a Crime)", and its trial-to-gallows plotline-- but it's bracketed by much more rock pomp than was expected or (probably) necessary. Bravo to the band for sidestepping the trap of trying to replicate a winning debut; if only the resulting sophomore effort didn't so blatantly feel like a losing effort.
After the film and interactive players departed Austin, a louder and shaggier music crowd took over the festival, helping solidify its reputation as a vital destination to catch and debate breaking talent and trends -- including the emerging hotspot of alt-comedy.

Record-breaking attendance of the concurrent film and interactive conferences (up 25% and 40% respectively from 2009), new programming that reflected their natural crossover and the ubiquitous influence of tweeting created a dynamic and intense atmosphere in this laidback city, whose slogan is "Keep Austin weird."

Kickstarted by SXSW staffer Charlie Sotelo a few years back, comedy programming is an emerging strand here, attracting big auds for faves from the alt-comedy scene.

The grungy attire of the music folks promenading 6th Street, SXSW's main drag, was noted -- to big laughs -- by comic Pete Holmes, first up in Comedy Central's inaugural SXSW showcase.

"SXSW has always been such a cool, trend-setting place and the comedy presence here is growing so we wanted to be a part of it," said Comedy Central talent scout Anne Harris.

Comedy Central execs were in full force, including original programming senior VP Lisa Leingang, also planning to scout talent from the remaining film slate.

The channel also showed auds the first episode of new animated series "Ugly Americans" before its broadcast preem that night.

With programming support from L.A.'s Comedy Death-Ray co-founder Scott Aukerman, Sotelo said SXSW comedy is in line with the fest's spirit of discovery.

"When Hannibal Buress first played here no one had heard of him and now he's a writer for SNL," Sotelo said. "Comedians want to come and hangout at SXSW -- because wherever the comedians are, that's where they want to be."

While buzzing pics like Lena Durham's narrative competition winner "Tiny Furniture," Aaron Katz's mumblecore thriller "Cold Weather" and Jeff Malmberg's docu winner "Marwencol" seem certain to find release homes following their SXSW bows, dozens more will find auds via new frontiers discussed this week.
It’s no secret that in your teenage to young adult years you make a lot of impulsive decisions that would make your parents cringe. I had a pretty conservative father, but still pushed the envelope when it came to my hair. It was all colors of the rainbow in my rebellious punk rock years. 

 

Other young adults may get wild piercings or tattoos to express themselves. Oftentimes we don’t think about how we will feel down the line with that permanent scar from that piercing or that tattoo of that great guy or girl we just started dating. Now that oral piercings have been around for a while, dentists are starting to see how these metal ornaments - even worn for short periods of time - are seriously affecting people’s smiles.

 

My close friend, who has 13 piercings on her face and ears, called me one day to ask if I had a good dentist. She saw my dentist and he let her know that she had a lot of minor tooth fractures and her gums on the bottom were receding due to 3 piercings she had under her lower lip.

 

Dentists are finding that the gentle back and forth motion of the metal button is enough to cause receding gums or even worse. It can cause significant deformities to gingival tissue that might not respond to gum surgery. This could even lead to tooth loss. Also, people could experience nerve damage or inflammation at the piercing site, fractured or chipped teeth or periodontal disease.

 

If you do choose to express yourself with metal in your mouth, make sure to visit your dentist regularly to prevent dental problems before they start. No one should want metal to outlast their own teeth.
