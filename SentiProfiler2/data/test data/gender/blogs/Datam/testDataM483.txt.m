The neoconservatives who worship General David Petraeus may not be too pleased with this--a briefing Petraeus prepared for his boss, Admiral Mike Mullen, on the regional problems being raised by Israel's instransigence on the settlements issue. If Israel were taking a moral position that upset the regional Arabs, like defending its right to exist (a limited strike in self-defense against the Hamas rocketers in Gaza, for example), I'd say that Arab disapproval would be a geo-strategic cost that we, as Israel's ally, would have to live with.
