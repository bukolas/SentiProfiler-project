WHY I LIKE HIM- Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or better known as APJ Abdul Kalam is known for his versatility.He has contributed a lot to India's development both as a president and as a scientist.He is a person who encourages youth,as he firmly believes that youth is the backbone of India.He is known for his quotes."Thinking is progress. Non-thinking is stagnation of the individual organisation and the country. Thinking leads to action. Knowledge without action is useless and irrelevant. Knowledge with action, converts adversity into prosperity."is one fine example. WHY I LIKE HIM- Shivaji Rao Gaekwad or better known as Rajinikanth is known for his hardwork and perseverance.Can you ever imagine a bus conductor turning into a celebrity who is known worldwide,and who has millions and millions practically chanting his name?Aint it far beyond our imagination..??Well yes, had Rajinikanth not been in this world.He is a person who is very well known for his hardwork and sets his life as an example for the same.He tells us clearly that "Appearance is not the only criteria one need to possess in oder to attract people".No wonder he is known across the globe.
