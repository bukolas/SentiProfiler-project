My mom came up to the city over the weekend to celebrate her birthday. The weather was gorgeous and we ended the afternoon with tea and cupcakes. Millie and I are planning a trip to Madrid and Paris later this year. I know it's a ways off but working at a hospital requires quite a bit of notice when I need an extended period of time off, at least according to my boss. Of course I'm getting antsy and ready for another vacation even though I was recently abroad; must be Spring Fever, or just my constant urge to travel. This picture is from a brief trip I took to Barcelona a few years ago, the nouveau architecture was so gorgeous. At least I have several months to practice my Spanish. I think about you all the time and wish you were still here. I went to see my friend Joyce this past weekend in Palo Alto. We went to some consignment shops loaded with designer goodies and I managed to get a practically brand new Chanel bag for just over $100. While on our little thrifting spree we drove past this amazing apartment building where I had to stop and get a closer look, I felt like I was back in Paris. I've been thinking about painting my living room coral or a salmon color which is what I did in my last apartment. It's pretty, goes well with antiques, and it's a soothing color. My only reservations are that I've been living in my place for 7 years and hate the idea of moving everything and taking all my pictures down even though my walls are dingy and could really use some fresh paint. Maybe I'll decide by spring time. The fashion world will not be the same without you.
