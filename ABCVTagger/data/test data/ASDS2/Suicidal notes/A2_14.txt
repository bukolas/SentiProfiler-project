The time has come for me to move on. I don't come to this decision lightly, however, but now that I'm older, I've finally realized that there's a world of difference between living happily ever after and just living ever after. I may seem strong. But I'm not I'm just like anyone else. We can feel pain. We can die. And I won't be the one to destroy anyone else's hopes and dreams. Never again.
