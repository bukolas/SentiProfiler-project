Okay, why are people actually giving this girl advice on how to stop eating?? There's something wrong with that!! If you feel you are eating too much, cut down on your portions and it requires discipline to control it, but you can. To not eat is dangerous. Do you realize what that can do to you? Let me tell you. Eventually, your body will start eating away at itself. You will lose muscle mass and all body fat. You will start to look sick and emaciated. Then, people will start to ask you if you have a drug problem or eating disorder. You'll feel embarrassed. You won't find clothing anymore that fits well. But that's the least of your problems. You'll start feeling dizzy and light headed from not eating. You may pass out a couple of times. Then, you can go into organ failure, have a heart attack or get congestive heart failure. If you're lucky, however, you may be able to be admitted to a hospital where they'll have to tube feed you. Aside from this, I would cut down on portions and discipline yourself to not eat ONLY when you don't feel hungry. Cut down on portions, eat a healthy diet and don't indulge in sweets all the time. Give them to yourself occasionally as a treat. It takes work, but you'll be fine.
