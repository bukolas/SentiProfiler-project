Another sad-but-interesting addition to my frozen menagerie - a Redwing that had died after flying into a window.Before I put it in the freezer (for later study - not eating), I stretched out its wings and wondered about the night-time journey on which the same feathers, muscles and bones carried it across the North Sea where did it make landfall? Scotland? Yorkshire? Suffolk?where it hatched last year - Sweden or Russia, perhaps?and saw how it still had fragments of soil stuck to its toes.I suppose it must have been foraging amongst the leaf litter until a few minutes before it died. It's really quite sad.
