This is my studio. Not just another room in the house. It holds all that is me. My studio is both my consolation and refuge. It is here, that I am me. My feelings, my fantasies, my emotions are buried in these paintings. All my desires are entombed here, suffocated in this very room. I acknowledge them when I am inside the studio and leave them behind when I leave. It happens to be a convenient arrangement for someone with a detached and troubled personality as I. For days, I forget to even eat and remain within this room. No, it doesn’t confine or restrict me. It is outside these four walls that I feel confined. I have to be someone else. I have to act like the someone else people expect me to be. Rather strange, but when I am working in my studio, I feel in control. I am aware of my feelings and I am in touch with my inner self. Is this what they call Nirvana? Yes, I have found my true love. My studio. Warning: Doesn’t have anything to do with me. I am only as artistic and nimble as a chicken.
