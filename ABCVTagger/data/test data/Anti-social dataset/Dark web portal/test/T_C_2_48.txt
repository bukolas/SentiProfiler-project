dont rely on kuffar........dont go to a magician to get rich, dont let the kuffar government bribe you..... muslim leaders in politic, and imams accept bribes from kuffar either to water down the religion of Islam or to spy on muslims. the point was some muslims abandon the practices of islam thinking ....its the kuffar who provide success....because they look at what the kuffar have...so they think acting more like the kuffar will make them successful ..so they're willing to sell themselves and their religion for a little money even muslims who move to the west...switch up their ways and start acting more like the kuffar and thinking thats the way to success
