Most of Sunbelt Software's business lies in supplying malware protection to its 25,000 Enterprise customers. Sunbelt also licenses its engine and sandbox analysis software to other vendors. But the people at Sunbelt are just as passionate about their consumer product, VIPRE Antivirus 4.0 ($29.95 direct). VIPRE did well in testing, and it offers some bonus features more often found in suites than in standalone antivirus utilities.
