Uh...creepy much?  Family Guy has always been one for the off-kilter comedy, but rarely has a series been so cavalier with its sacred canon than last night's "Go Stewie, Go."  Lois cheating on Peter, Brian coming onto Stewie in drag, Meg being Meg...Seth MacFarlane is all over the place. Last night saw the first Family Guy since February's "Extra-Large Medium," and the break hasn't done any favors for the show.  All the usual throw-away gags ensue, mostly falling flat, but occasionally garnering a chuckle or two
