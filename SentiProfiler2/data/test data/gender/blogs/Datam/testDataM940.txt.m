"Do you think she's lonely?" came the question regarding this old care-taker; and it was startling to think that such a person of joy could even think to be lonely at such a place near the beach.  Yet, there was something different about Marta; she sat in her chair outside the screen door while her cat Princess slowly shuffled her tail back and fourth.  I quickly learned that this woman would be someone who changed my perspective on dreams.  We sat with her, the morning after, while she recounted her story through the decades, through hardships, struggles, sickness and travel and I was startled to hear this Argentine woman declare that she has adopted Venezuela as her new home and her new heritage.
