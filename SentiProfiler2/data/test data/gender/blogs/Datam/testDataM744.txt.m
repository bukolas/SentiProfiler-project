It has been a couple of days since I wrote my last followup blog entry about my dealings with Charter Communications. I appreciate the fact that all of my initial service setup and installation issues were resolved in a professional and high quality manner. Unfortunately, the customer care, service and treatment that I received, was after the multiple problems had already occurred. The customer care, service and treatment after the multiple problems occurred, should have been the customer care, service and treament that I and all customers should receive from our very initial contact with this company. Until Charter Communications takes a good hard look at how some of their customers are treated, from their initial contact through installation of services and beyond , and make some serious changes, they will never being to compete with companies such as Cox Cable and Verizon. Today is our first day here without one box to unpack. I took my last 2 loads of broken down boxes and huge piles of the movers wrapping paper to the recycle center. I was going to start going for my walks again today but it is rather cool and drizzly out. I will start my walks again tomorrow. My foot has been doing better. Actually I have been so busy that I really have not had much time to pay attention to it even if it was hurting. I guess I will have a better idea what shape it is in when I start my walking routine up. For the normal around the house living, it seems to be doing fine. Veronica is just starting the hiring process for future employees at her new store. Everyone seems very excited to have a new store here on the OBX . They are conducting interviews at the local Ramada Inn, in Nags Head. I heard that one politician in the area told Veronica that she could expect approximately 5000 people to show up for the open employment interviews that will be conducted over the next 3 days. From what I have heard, unemployment for this area is extremely high...over 25%. It is hard to believe that in about 45 days, Veronica and I will be heading out to Alaska on our cruise. By the time that our vacation does arrive, we will surely be ready for a nice break. We were invited to a grand opening of a local restaurant near where we live but unfortunately we could not go. I am sure that we will try the restaurant out in the future. It is less than a mile from where we live. They also had a big parade, a car show and a Taste of The Beach Festival going on yesterday but Veronica and I could not go to that either because we had to get the rest of the unpacking done and finished. I am glad we did stay home and got everything done. I am sure that there will be other events that we can go to as time goes by. Later on this week, we will go to take our drivers license test...they have you take a written test around here. Thank God there is no actual driving test given or else I could be in big trouble. Of course even with the written test, I could be in trouble. Never was good with written tests. Might actually have to break down and study. Feels like I am going back to my High School days. Finally....all and I mean every single box has been gone through, emptied, broken down and taken out of this place....except for a few boxes that we decided not to empty...contents weren't needed. My vehicle has about 40 or more boxes broken down in the back of it. I will be going to the Recycle Center first thing in the morning. After dropping off of the boxes, I will return and load the RAV 4 up with all of the movers wrapping paper. We ended up buying ourselves a new couch and a new dining room set. Originally we were going to share an office and Veronica's craft room. Unfortunately after opening all of the craft room moving boxes, it became very apparent that there was just no way that our computers and computer related furniture was going to fit in with all of that craft room items. I could not believe how tight it was in there. It really was unbearable. So after a real brief discussion and I mean brief, we both decided that it would be in our best interest to put our computer room downstairs in the 1st floor spare bedroom. This is the bedroom that we were using for some indoor storage of extra boxes and rubber storage tubs. So this morning, Veronica and I got up early and moved all of our computer stuff downstairs. It will be a while until Veronica has a chance to put her craft room aka "The Studio" together but when she does, she will have a room all her own for her artistic endeavors. I think that I will try to just relax the rest of today because tomorrow I will be on the run again. Below are some photos of our new place: Here are some photos of or bedroom Master bathroom 2 nd floor hallway Here is a photo of "the door". Behind this door evil lies. Actually, behind this door a real mess resides...at least for now...Veronica's art studio 3rd floor landing Living room, dining room, library room and kitchen photos This is our new computer room...rather spacious compared to the cramped room we were in and as a bonus....it will be much cooler in the Summer months Today Veronica and I got up early to tackle our last major obstacle...the craft room. The boxes seem endless and it will probably take most of the day to get close to being done. Hopefully we will get finished within the next 2 days, so that maybe we can take a deep breath and possibly relax for a minute....just a thought..... Shortly after I wrote and posted my last blog entry, I received a comment from an Eric Ketzer . You can view the posted comment by clicking the comments link on my previous blog entry. As it turns out, Mr. Ketzer is the Social Media Communications Manager for Charter Communications. To be honest with you...I was really floored to have had someone locate my blog entry and then take the time to leave a comment and write me, requesting information to help solve a problematic issue. Mr. Ketzer also sent me an email requesting information about my address, the order number and information that applied to my installation. A short while later, I received a telephone call from another Charter representative named Antoine. We ended up on a 4 way conference call with myself, Antoine, Brad(the local installation supervisor) and I believe it was someone from billing. After discussing the situation, it was agreed that Brad and/or another Quality Assurance Technician would be at my home this morning at 9AM. Brad assured me that they would make everything right for me, on the installation aspect of things. The individual, from what I think was billing, told me that Charter Communications would compensate me for our troubles by giving us a free month of total service and there would be no charge for the installation. After the telephone call ended, I felt much better that we were heading in the right direction of getting this matter settled. Brad along with the Quality Assurance Technician arrived here at 9 AM sharp and they went through the complete installation process for all of our services...cable, telephone and internet . They checked whatever work that had been previously done by the last technician, discussed options with me and made all of the appropriate changes so that I would get the maximum level of quality for each service that I ordered. These 2 gentlemen were highly qualified, very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with everything that they did and all of the services that they provided me. I want to publicly thank Charter Communications, Mr. Eric Ketzer , Antoine, the person from billing whom I spoke to on the telephone, Brad the local Installation Supervisor, the QA technician whose name escapes me....sorry...chalk it up to old age...and another young lady by the name of April, for helping turn this negative situation into a very acceptable and positive outcome. I thank you all. Now I can finally make full use of our new Samsung television...life is good and so are the Kansas Jayhawk basketball team... especially in HD...Rock Chalk Jayhawk...Beak'm Hawks!!!! Our move is complete. Everything was delivered to our new home last Friday. The delivery was smooth and uneventful...just the way I like it. Spent 2-3 days running around getting everything unpacked and put away. Luckily there is a recycle center only about 1 1/2 miles up the road. So after rolling up batches of packing paper and taping it into bundles and breaking down all of the boxes, I was busy taking many loads to the recycle center. Unfortunately we have been dealing with a few other problems which have made this move unpleasant up to this point in tie. In a previous blog entry, I had made mention about the trouble I was having getting our car insurance transfered over to North Carolina. The agent that I had been dealing with had made a couple of mistakes when he entered information as far as my address and other important info needed for my insurance. This agent had switched numbers on our PO Box number. Because of this error, it has caused us not to receive any documents from State Farm showing that we indeed have insurance coverage in North Carolina. Every time I called him, he said that he mailed the paperwork to me. After I found out that he had mailed it to the wrong address, I requested that he change all documents to the correct address. Unfortunately this has been difficult to get accomplished at the cooperate level for some reason. We were planning on going to get our drivers license today and I told the agent this, a couple of days ago. He told me that if I call him before I go to DMV , that he would fax the forms over there, to show proof that we had auto insurance. I was not comfortable doing that because we had not had much luck with him getting things done correctly along with the fact that I was afraid that I would not be able to contact him before we headed to get our drivers licenses and even if we did contact him, that we would get to DMV only to find out that he had not faxed over the paperwork that we needed. The bottom line is that I had lost all faith with this agent and was not comfortable dealing with him any longer. Heaven forbid we should have an accident and needed someone that we could depend upon to provide us with the proper service or help us with any insurance needs that we might have. I placed a telephone call to the head of that agency and left a message for him to call me. I did not hear from him until later on the next day and by that time, I had already put into motion a transfers of our auto insurance policies to another agency. Had he called me the same day that I had called him, we would have most likely stayed with his agency but utilized a different agent within his agency. Because of the error of putting the wrong mailing address down initially, it will take a couple of weeks for this all to be settled and straightened out and for all of our auto insurance policies to be transferred over to this new agency. And now for the icing on the cake...Charter Communications. My experiences and frustration with Charter Cable has been previously documented in some earlier blog entries but with yesterdays fiasco, Charter Communications really outdid themselves. Below is a brief synopsis of the customer service that we received from Charter Communications: The tech was running behind and showed up 45 minutes late...3:45...no big deal because it happens all of the time. As soon as he got there, we knew we were in for trouble. The place where we live is brand new. It has all of the wiring within the walls for telephone, cable and internet services. Nothing on the outside has ever been hooked up,so basically the tech is starting from scratch. Right from the start, he is complaining about how behind he is and how many more service calls he has scheduled for the afternoon. He comes inside and looks at the number of telephones that we have...3 to be exact and all are different. The tech tells us that we should have "one main bank" for 3 identical phones to charge in. This would have made his job easier...he made it sound like everyone has a set up like he wants and made us feel that we should go out and buy a system like the one he was speaking about. The tech spent the next 4 hours complaining about the num ber of stairs he was having to climb, the number of times he had to go up and down those stairs, he was on the phone talking to another tech and a sking her if she had heard the crazy lady that he had as a customer earlier in the day and then proceeded to tell me that this lady(another customer) was a lunatic, bitching to me about the number of jumpers that he was putting together and the number of splitters that he had to use. It was just complaint after complaint. After he once again was complaining about him missing other appointments, I told him that his complaint should be with whoever does the scheduling...not with me. The longer he was there, the more tense and stressful the situation became. I found this tech climbing on our bedroom dresser so that he could plug in a cable wire. On several telephone calls that he had with what sounded like other techs, he was heard complaining about the job that he was here for. He complained and blamed us because this job was taking so long, that he was losing money by not being able to get to other installation appointments. Before everything was done, this tech had packed his stuff up and taken it all downstairs to his truck. By this time, there were cable wires laying over our bed, the nightstand was pulled out and had some unknown type of equipment on it...must have something to do with the phone and basically cables laying here there and everywhere. I mentioned to the tech that the upstairs television had not been hooked up to the cable wire and that he did not leave any cable wire for me to hook to tv up to it. It was at this time that things got real nasty. The tech told me "can't you just go out to a store and buy some cable wire" and "are you too cheap to buy some cable wire" and "all of my wire and tools are down in the truck" and "I have already done a bunch of jumpers, splitters and 50 cables for you". I could not believe what I was hearing. I then looked in our office/craft room where our computers are and my desktop had not been hooked up to the internet . I told the tech that this job was not complete. He then stated that he would hook the wire up to my computer...he was saying it in a really sarcastic fashion. We explained to him about all of the things that were not done and about his behavior throughout the 4 hour ordeal. He really did not have much to say about it, other than to reiterate the amount of work that he had to do and the number of appointments that he missed because of us. It became a rather personal thing at thing point. We told him that we were customers too and that the service that he provided was not acceptable. We told him that we wanted a receipt for money that we owed Charter Communications...they take $90 COD and then apply that amount towards your first bill. We got our receipt but refused to sign off on one of the sheets of paperwork that he had. Veronica did sign off on one of the pieces of paperwork but also wrote on it that the job was not complete and that we would be contacting a supervisor. As soon as the tech left, I did file a formal complaint with Charter Communications. After not hearing from anyone this morning, I called Charter Communications back again and spoke to a supervisor. This supervisor was able to pull up my my official complaint from last night, which listed in detail, all of the things that were done, were said and not done by this technician. The supervisor got in touch with the local dispatcher and the local installation supervisor. I am now awaiting a call back from the local installation supervisor so that we can discuss and rectify this situation. Never in my life, have I ever received such poor quality service from any company nor have I ever had a technician that behaved in such a rude and unprofessional manner. Hopefully I will have happier news in the near future but for now...the beat goes on. I got up early this morning and drove to OBX . I went to the management company and got our keys. I then went to our new condo and unloaded my car. I put up the curtain rods, curtains, shower curtains along wi
h a bunch of bathroom towels. It ended up being one of those days...if anything could go wrong...it did. I finally got everything and all of the extras that were packed in the car, got put away. One thing I forgot to bring was some window cleaner and paper towels. I was planning on cleaning up things in the kitchen and bathrooms. Probably a good thing that I forgot the spritz because it took me all day just to get everything else done. Although everything is brand new, this condo has been closed up for a couple of years now, so everything will need a good cleaning. Tomorrow night the computers get torn down so I won't be back online until the 10 th of March...at least that is when Charter is supposed to install cable, telephone and internet . So the next blog entry will be coming from our new place. After not hearing from the Charter Communications rep about my initial assigned telephone number being lost out in limbo land, I decided not to wait around for them to find it. I went ahead and took the new number. I also went ahead and made my way through my long list of businesses to contact and let them know my "new" new telephone number. Monday I will be heading down to OBX early in the morning. I need to stop by and pick up our keys and then head over to the place. I have a vehicle full of stuff to unload and then I need to start putting up curtain rods and curtails. After that I will do some work in the bathrooms...putting up shower curtains and towels. Hopefully I can get it all done during this one trip. On Wednesday the moving crew comes to box everything up and then on Thursday they will be here early to pack the truck. Starting on Wed we won't have any internet nor computers. We won't have any internet until 3/10, at which time Charter will come out to our new place and set us up with telephone, internet and cable service. This upcoming week with be hectic to say the least be at least we are making progress.
