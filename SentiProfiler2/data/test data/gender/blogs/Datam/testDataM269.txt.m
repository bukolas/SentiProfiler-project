Georgia absolutely hammered Russia in the European Nations Cup Qualifier, running out easy 36:8 winners.

Both teams had already qualified for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, but the result means that Georgia will play against Scotland, England and Argentina in Pool B, while Russia will face Australia, Ireland, Italy and – most intriguingly – the United States in Pool C.

Full match report to follow, plus news of the Romania Portugal match, but on this performance, it looks like Georgia will be a handful in next year’s World Cup. The British press are reporting that British troops will take part in this year’s Victory Day Parade in Red Square on May 9th. They’ll be joining troops from America, France and, of course, Russia, to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of the second world war.

According to the British Embassy:

    Research suggests that this is the first time British troops have marched on Red Square 

How much research they actually did is pretty questionable, considering that this picture was taken less than three years ago: They’re marching and playing in the first Russian Military Tattoo, also known as the Kremlin Zoria Festival, which took place in 2007. If you look carefully, you can see representatives from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, the Royal Scots Borderers, the Black Watch, the Highlanders, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Corps of Signals. Plus a whole host of military musicians from other Commonwealth countries.

British marching bands were set to attend the second Tattoo, in 2008, as well, but the Russia-Georgia war put paid to that plan.

Much more about the Moscow Military Tattoo here, including links to lots more pictures. Here’s my absolute favourite. This weekend sees Georgia play Russia in the deciding match of the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup Season. Russia have been playing second fiddle to Georgia all season, but Romania’s shock defeat of Georgia last week means that Russia and Georgia are now level on points at the top of the table, and all is to play for.

To add a little more pressure to this match between the two massive rivals (if more was needed between two countries that fought a war only eighteen months ago), the outcome of the match will decide who qualifies in first place for next year’s Rugby World Cup Finals in New Zealand. Both teams have already qualified, but the team who finishes first in the European Nations Cup will find themselves in the tougher World Cup group – which creates an oddly perverse incentive for each team to throw the game.

This weekend also sees a vital matchup between Romania and Portugal – the winner of which is likely to take the third and final World Cup Qualifying spot.

As ever, we’ll have the results for you here on Siberian Light next week.
