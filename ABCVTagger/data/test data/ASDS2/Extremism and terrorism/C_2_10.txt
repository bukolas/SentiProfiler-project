Gaza clash: Hamas forces clashed with supporters of a radical cleric in the Gaza Strip following a provocative anti-Hamas sermon delivered Friday. The gunfight is taking place near a Rafah mosque and both sides are making use of mortar fire. At least 15 people were reportedly wounded in the shootout. The Gaza Strip is an Islamic emirate, local Salafi leader Abdul Latif Musa told worshippers during a prayer session earlier, slamming Hamas' conduct in Gaza and pledging his supporters' allegiance to al-Qaeda. "We belong to al-Qaeda and our leader is Osama Bin Laden," said Musa, considered the leader of Gaza's Salafi branch. In his sermon, Musa criticized Hamas' attitude, arguing that it is not sufficiently Islamic and noting that his supporters are making an effort to impose Islamic law in the Strip. He said that Hamas presents an Islamic veneer but adopts what amounts to secular policy. "It's not implementing Islamic law and prefers to meet with Congress members and with Blair and Carter," he said. "Should Hamas choose the way of Allah and the way of Jihad, we shall be its servants, but if they try to take over our mosques, we'll cut off their arms." Musa declared that his supporters are willing to fight Hamas, and charged the group with seizing weapons worth $120,000 from his group. "We will hurt those who hurt us," he said. "We will turn Hamas' life into hell if they try to hurt us.
