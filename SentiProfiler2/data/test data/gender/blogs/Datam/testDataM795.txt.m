I didn't attend this year's Photo Marketing Association (PMA) show, but as I read the coverage at PCMag and other places, a couple of trends were apparent to me. The first is a push for mid-size cameras, somewhere between point-and-shoot still cameras and the larger, traditional single lens reflex cameras (SLR); the second is a trend toward putting better quality sensors in high-end point-and-shoot cameras, even if that means a lower megapixel count.In the "in-between" category of cameras that are smaller than a traditional SLR but still offer things like interchangeable lenses, a lot of the interest has been in the Micro Four Thirds segment. Olympus and Panasonic are promoting this system, which still lets you interchange lens but does not use the mirror of an SLR, and thus has a smaller body.
