Sriram aka mechsri is quite well known for his scholarly abilities & very much unknown for his inhibited mischievous character.. Knowin dis guy since 1st yr has been really nice.. we r all one close knitted group over der n d kinda fun we have together goin out for movies, budget dinner... not to forget d trips we had,, memorable one to mention was our adventurous trip to Tiruchi in d 2nd yr holidays, then our enjoyment at REC-T .. whoa whoa.. he has so many fans spread around d city, state & in d country (especially gal fans..).. We don't miss his treats every yr after he gets d merit scholarship.. so for d sake of d treat, v all pray for him!! (now don't hit me da)..
last but not d least ppl don't under-estimate dis little guy from his appearance.. he is as explosive like a small atom (in all sense)-- dat explains more about his naivity & innocence for guys n gals who think he is.. I wish him all d best in his endeavours & keepin rockin dude(PS among male peers too).. Long live our f'ship..Cheers!!
