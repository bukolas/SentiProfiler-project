I recently received a couple of Elizabeth Arden’s new, very covetable, eyeshadow compacts.
Color Intrigue Eyeshadow Duos come in an elegant compact printed with an inspiring quote from Elizabeth Arden: “To be beautiful and natural is the birthright of every woman.”While the compact itself is certainly worthy of beauty lust, the eyeshadow inside makes these duos worth buying.I reviewed Color Intrigue eyeshadow before and I’m a fan of the product’s beautifully smooth, blendable, crease-free formula.I tried two of the duos, both of which are ultra-wearable and will flatter most skin tones. “Autumn Leaves” is a silky matte duo that pairs a warm shade of peach with the perfect shade of cocoa brown.
