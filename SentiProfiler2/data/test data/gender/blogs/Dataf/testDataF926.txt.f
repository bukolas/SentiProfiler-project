You know those people that post things like "I wish I could go back before everything went wrong" , "I have tons of homework-FML", or "I'm sick of all of this crap, it's making my life horible." on their Facebook statuses or Myspace updates or whatever? THEY ANNOY ME BEYOND BELIEF. We as Americans, living in Boerne, which, while it may be a little dull, is nice and safe and clean and better than a lot of other places. And we HAVE NO IDEA how lucky we are. Drama at school will pass, get over it. It is truly not that big of a deal. I'm so sick of hearing people complain about things that others would count as blessings, like the fact that our school cares enough about us having a future to give us homework and tests to help us learn, grow, and be able to do whatever we want with our futures. Did you know that out of the 11 million childen in Africa, only 18% of them graduate from primary education, which is to us, Middle School? They have no way of acquiring a job, they can't use knowledge to figure out life problems-they're on their own, and so many of them long to be educated, while we sit here and complain about the people who take time out of their own days to teach us and help us achieve the next highest degree of education. I'm not saying I enjoy the homework, or the tests, or the long, boring hours spent sitting in school, but i look past all of that and see the big picture. I appreciate what my teaches are doing for me, and I wish that more of my peers would do the same.
