Most everyone around the world is prejudice in different ways, some more extreme than others; but no matter how extreme the prejudice is it will always have a negative effect. People have always had and will always have their differences, but we do not have to be so ignorant and discriminate against different ideas, races, sexual orientation, or religions;(even though most denominations cause discrimination themselves.)Though I also don't agree with people slapping other people in the face with their life styles. Whether it be a racist not treating one person as fairly as the other for obvious reasons of being a racist, or a very religious person telling you what their beliefs are for the consequences of your actions while trying to convince you that they are right about what they are telling you.
