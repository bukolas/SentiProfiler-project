I live to bash Al-Farouq Aminu, so bash him I will.  The only chance Wake has of winning this game is if they do it in spite of Aminu.  The kid is – amongst many other things – garbage.  You sit there waiting for him to assert himself until you realize he can’t.  Three words to describe Aminu: uncomfortable, disconnected, and content.  Similar to how I want you to be aware of my Turner love, I also want you to fully understand my Aminu hate.  I’m as low on Aminu – pause – as I am high on Wall.
