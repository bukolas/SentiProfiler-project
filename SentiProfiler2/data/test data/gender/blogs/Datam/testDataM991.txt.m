The Wind In The Willows' is one of my favourite children's books but i always felt that Kenneth Grahame failed to give us sufficient closure. Sure Mr Toad escaped prison and won back Toad Hall but what was his life like after the experience of prison?

'Well Mr Toad may i just say that you've impressed us very much in the interview stage and i think you'll be hearing from us very soon'
"oh that's fantastic. thank you"
"We've just got to ask you a few standard questions"
"Sure, go ahead"
"have you got any previous criminal convictions?"
"ummmm i do actually, but it was a long time ago and i can promise you that i've changed"
"ok, what was the conviction for?"
"umm well it's convictionS actually. One was for stealing a car, after which i proceeded to shout stuff at people while speeding past."
(Mr Toad has a real compulsion to always tell the truth since he found God)
"ok well that shouldn't...."
"...and i killed a man"

Yeah Mr Toad killed a man years before the grand theft auto incident. Well by man he means shrew because in this sick world that Kenneth Grahame created where moles converse with badgers, a man's life is worth the same as a shrews.
