As much as I liked - but didn't necessarily love - Avatar, I absolutely got that it was a big-screen, 3D, IMAX experience, meant to be enjoyed in an immense theater, filled with the latest in cinematic technology and surrounded by fans as emotionally connected to the material as yourself. It was the kind of movie that simply wouldn't be as engaging at home, no matter how high the definition in which you watched it...Or how large your television...Or how great your sound system...
