We believe that while investments in ERP will continue, many large businesses are buying additional user-licences and modules as they expand their operations and networks. Says Ravi Kathuria, Director, Marketing and Solutions, SSA Global India, “We find a good percentage (over 50 percent) of our business coming from repeat orders from these large enterprises in the form of additional user-licences and functionality modules including HR and payroll. This is because their transactions have grown along with capacities and sales.”
