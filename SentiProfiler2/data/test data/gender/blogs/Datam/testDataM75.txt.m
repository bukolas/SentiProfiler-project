How good is a good client?
Posted by Scott on Mar 13, 2010 in Marketing
I have a client on paper that is a good client, however in actuality I cringe every time she calls or when I see her. She has three kids and we have photographed all three for senior pix and all 3 kids she spent over 3k each for their senior orders. Plus we have done their family pictures with another large order. So like I said she’s good on paper. Why do I cringe… Because she follows 0% of our rules. She takes months to order, she pays right away but then takes months to place the order and when she does she submits partial orders and then wants it in like two days. She’s always calling needing something done today she pushes everything right up to a deadline and then calls us on the day of the deadline to tell us about it. (like image submission for the yearbook for all three kids she called us on the deadline day and said I need this now) 3x WTF and this year she did it twice because the first deadline was for the regular pix and then she called for a picture ad page in the yearbook with a different deadline. She’s always changing her mind and has an attitude because she knows she spends a lot of money here so she thinks she owns me. I hate people like that, she is very unorganized and and wreaks havoc on our organized system. Maybe that’s my main problem with her just dealing with her we just feel like we are always fixing her messes. Kelly is sick of her. It was funny a few months ago she did a typical move on placing a partial order and Kelly asked me why I let her do that? I said because she’s a good customer… To which Kelly replied without missing a beat “like hell she is, she may spend a lot of money here but she’s far from being a good customer” it was a shocking thing for me to realize that a good customer and a big spender are two completely different things. And in her case a repeat big spender but still a habitual, chronic, pain in our collective asses! Hehe can you tell she just contacted me again about something… Don’t sell your soul or spine for money. “this is how we do it” our relationship with her would be so much better had I stuck to our policies 4yrs ago when we photographed their first son. Granted she loves us because I’m like no problem.. Right away… Sure… Yes anything for you… Why am I such a stupid person when it comes to her. Kelly is funny when she sees her name pop up on the caller Id she says “you better answer that because you don’t want me talking to her” so if you didn’t notice Kelly has bigger balls than me. But seriously I created this monster and this is their last kid but she’s already been talking about bringing in future grand babies for pix. Oh shoot me now!!! I guess I will have to deal with this situation I need a client intervention, and some bigger balls! lol

Working all weekend…
Posted by Scott on Mar 12, 2010 in Marketing
Well I did it to myself but i’m working all weekend… Saturday shooting seniors and one of the sessions is an outdoor session and it’s supposed to rain.  Then I agreed to shoot a family on Sunday.  It’s a client that has been coming to us for almost 10 years and they own a business that Sunday is the only day they can do it… seriously.  I know a lot of clients claim they can’t do any-other day but a Sunday but these guys are serious.  It’s going to be a very good order I’m sure.  Maybe enough to pay for a year of college for the kids    LOL
Day 3 of P90x not so bad, and actually my best day.  Kelly and I are doing it together it is fun, so even if you hear me complaining it is kicking my butt but still fun.  Not as fun a Sweatin to the oldies would be… I need to get me a Richard Simmons outfit to workout in… Oh that would be sweet!
