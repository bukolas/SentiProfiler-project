You are a special breed of mom. You were hand-selected to parent a most fascinating and positively wonderful child. Your child may be trying at times, but they are remarkable in spite of it. Your child may require extra attention, extra study, extra love, but you have all of that to give and more. You are a special breed of mom because you were chosen to parent a special child, an ADHD child. You are a supermom because you are right here reading this, spending time looking for answers for your ADHD child and sharing a bit of yourself to help others. I applaud you. Keep your chin up and know that you were meant for this extraordinary job and you absolutely have the strength to give your unique child what they need -- love. Lots of love. This, my friends, is a standing ovation in your honor.
