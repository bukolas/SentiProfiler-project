When the world was explored, many exotic creatures and cultures were found. Many of them more tolerant and adaptable than those of the first explorers. The men and women of these cultures were different in  customs, behaviour, speech and appearance, and hence became candidates for brutal discrimination. Man against man perpetrated the most inhuman of all crimes. Then arose a cry for equality, from men and women courageous enough to stand up to their oppressors. And then began a battle without. This battle was of little consequence until men and women of all types could set aside their differences and accept their humanity as their first identity, their equality as a matter of course. Slowly, the tides turned. People became more tolerant. And yet the battle was not won. It is not won. Often, equality has been confused with bland conformity, which resulted in socialist and marxist movements. Noble were their ideals and yet, as history has shown, they were doomed to fall. In hindsight, this is obvious, because every man and woman seeks to be different, to stand out from the crowd, to achieve a higher station in society, to be appreciated.
