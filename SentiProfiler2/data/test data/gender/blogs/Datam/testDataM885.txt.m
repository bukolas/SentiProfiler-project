I had pretty bad vision since I was in 3rd grade.  About 5 years ago, after watching many people around me get Lasik, I decided to take the plunge.  Because this was an elective surgery that in rare cases, could cause damage to my eyes, I decided to find the absolute best doctor for the job. I chose  Dr Coleman Kraff and he was amazing to watch.  Very confident, poised, fast, and focused....well like a laser.
