Maha is a bundle of energy. Loves to have fun, enjoys life to the fullest and then of course - lives for the present (pun intended ;-). Down to earth, believes in a heap load of her own "principles" !!! Good sense of humour and a shweeet smile. It definitely pays to be in her good books :-)))
And who better to write this testimonial than me - her anbu thangatchi !! Aint I lucky ?!? Cos Manjuu..u r simply the best.
