Pope Benedict has apologised to the victims and survivors of clerical abuse in Ireland and expressed his disappointment at the failure of Irish bishops to deal appropriately with abuse allegations. In his long-awaited Pastoral Letter, he writes: "I can only share in the dismay and the sense of betrayal that so many of you have experienced on learning of these sinful and criminal acts and the way Church authorities in Ireland dealt with them."

The picture shows Cardinal Sean Brady handing out copies of the Letter at Saint Patrick's Cathedral today. The cardinal began his speech of welcome for the Letter with these words: "My dear people of the Cathedral Parish of Armagh, today is a very historic day for the Catholics of Ireland. Pope Benedict has written a pastoral letter to express his closeness to us at this challenging time." In expressing his closeness, the Pope also told the Cardinal and his episcopal colleagues that their credibility and effectiveness have been "seriously undermined" by their failure to act appropriately to protect children from abuse.

The Pastoral Letter is historic for a number of reasons, not least because it is the first official papal document dealing with the clerical abuse crisis facing the Catholic Church for 25 years. The Letter, as predicted, does not explore issues of organisational reform within the church in ireland, but the Pope announces that he plans to send Apostolic Visitors to certain dioceses, religious orders and seminaries in Ireland. That may be an indication of further proposals for re-organising the church or dealing with systemic issues that permitted abuse to continue unchecked for so long.

Pope Benedict also calls on the Irish church to re-embrace the disciplines of Catholic spirituality; that section of the Letter may prove controversial because it is clear that the Pope believes that the loss of those disciplines, alongside the rise of certain kinds of modernist ideas and practices within the western church, helped to create the conditions in which the abuse crisis was born (see paragraph 4).
