I hate to vent on the blog because people who vent are sad, lonely creatures who cannot handle their emotions and/or thoughts in a socially acceptable way, thus inflicting their stresses upon the many terabytes of data floating in this universe causing an as-yet-unknown form of verbal pollution.

But I have to vent.

Recently, I've been going out with angmohgais / guai loh / expats. Am I an SPG (Sarong Party Girl)? Yes. In fact, twice when I went out with angmohgais, I wore sarongs. The point is, its not that I don't care - because I do. I am hardly independent enough to not need validation from my fellow countrymen. But I resent this greatly.

Of course, we could do this the legal pad way. Pros and Cons, Compare and Contrast, et al. But why would I when the comparisons are so painfully obvious? Because, otherwise, I would get such hair-raisingly predictable responses that I would forever regret this diatribe.
