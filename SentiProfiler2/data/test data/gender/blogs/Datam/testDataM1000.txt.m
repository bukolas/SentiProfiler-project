I appreciate the mums for the color and long season they bring to the late summer and fall gardens. I am not particularly knowledgeable about them nor do I care to be...  for me it's simply a matter of planting them, shearing them a few times through July 4th (at least twice, but I prefer three if I get around to it), and watching them bloom. I know I should hand 'pinch' them to help them fill out, but I just don't care to spend that much time on the chore... hedge shears work for me and after a bit of time has passed, any stems that were missed will grow beyond the main body of the plant... that's when I hand pinch those stems. As I said... I think it's time to divide them and spread them about the gardens, so I will go for that this spring.
