Michelle "Bombshell" McGee is the latest unchaste woman to destroy a high-profile marriage. She didn't do it for love or even lust, she did it for fame and a payday.

Sources close to the "tattoo model" revealed exclusively to Technorati, that McGee, mother of two, was paid close to $30,000 for her story about the alleged affair between her and West Coast Choppers CEO and hubby to Oscar winning actress Sandra Bullock. Our source tells us McGee was fully aware that Sandra and Jesse were still together when she began the affair, and was hoping the affair would be her ticket to "mainstream celebrity."  Mainstream infamy is more like it.

McGee, who claims to have been brought up Amish, says she left the church and her family at the age of 16 and moved to California where she began a life as a tattoo model. McGee, who has too many tattoos to count covering at least 70% of her body, including her face, approached James about modeling for his well-known company. She claims Jesse emailed her and told her to correspond with him at his private email. The two met at his garage and it was then they began their intimate relationship, which she states lasted 11 months.

There's even more disturbing news in this story which alleges James texted her as recently as March 14, just days after his wife's incredible Oscar win for Best Actress. Bullock, who has publicly and privately support her husband and his bid to win full custody of his youngest daughter Sunny, must be incredibly hurt and devastated to find out he was intimate with another woman. A woman who has an uncanny likeness to the same ex-wife he left for her drug use and volatility.
