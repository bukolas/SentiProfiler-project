Note:  My apologies for the prior version of this post.  I wrote it too quickly and did not give it a good proof reading.

I read an article the other day by Arthur Langer about how IT can survive the current economic recession.  I was struck by the following piece of advice:

“Move more IT expenses into business units.  This keeps all the dollars from being in one large IT budget.  It also allows business units to defend their requests for extra spending.”

I read this recommendation a few times.  Langer’s other advice, shown below, makes sense.  The points below are sound.

    * Show why investments need to precede—not lag—the recovery.  Give historical proof that this method works and timelines that will better position the business to compete.
    * Ask for smaller amounts of investments, allowing the business to be somewhat cautious should economic trends not improve.
    * Don’t expect the budget you might ultimately need, but rather the dollars that will allow you to deliver some portion of the overall product strategy.
    * Commit to product reviews, perhaps every 90 days.  This way, executives can feel that they can change priorities if and when necessary.

The idea of moving (hiding) IT expenses in the business unit to make them small enough not to be noticed seems out of place in this list.
