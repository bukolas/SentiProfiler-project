When searching for a car seat, saftey was our number one priority. Comfort was our second. The Britax line of car seats delivers both.  Yes, they are more expensive than most of the car seats on the market, but once you experience them you will know why. They have the highest saftey rating in the industry, are built crazy strong, and are SO comfy for your little ones. They are easy to clean as all of the covers come off and can be washed as well.
