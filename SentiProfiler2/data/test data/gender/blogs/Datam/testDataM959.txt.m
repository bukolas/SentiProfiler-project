Hello and sorry for the lateness it has been a busy weekend for me. Dealing with school, life, and my personal worries.(not having a boyfriend, the people around me hating me, and the general OMG IM GONNA DIE!!!!)

This last week has been very annoying, as I was in a stupor of slight depression all week due to a couple of incidents that really made me mad/upset. I won't go into details, but suffice it to say it involved homophobic remarks and a huge idiot who thinks himself very important. After discussing it with my mom(I know pathetic but it helped me feel better), I started thinking about why attitudes like that still persist in our schools. at first my anger wouldn’t let me think anything accept "stupid bloody fucking town!". However, after a while it came to me, education, or lack thereof.

All through history, prejudices have persisted through lack of information about the prejudiced group, thing, or person. It is the same with the ideas and prejudices about homosexuals, in my opinion it is all thanks to religion and I don’t just mean Christians, Catholics, and any other church based on those churches. I mean other religions like the ones that are practised in the Middle East. most factions of these religions are the ones responsible for the bad attitudes. How does this relate to my whole epiphany i talked about? well in my opinion these religions didn't base their opinions and attitudes on fact but on ideas that came from their bible or god. They didn't take time to realize that were not horrible sinning freaks, they got this idea of us in their heads and refused to see that they may have been wrong.
