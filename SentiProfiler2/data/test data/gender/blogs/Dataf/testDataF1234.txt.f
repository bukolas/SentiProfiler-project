I'd like to see every citizen of the United States guaranteed basic health care at reasonable prices. We claim to be advanced, enlightened, the best country in the world, and yet our citizens often go without medical care because they can't afford it - or can't afford the health insurance. The insurance provided through my job is a flat rate regardless of how many people it covers. I am single, no dependents, and yet my insurance premiums cost the same as a co-worker with a family of five. At one point, between jobs, I tried to get independent insurance coverage and was refused because of my weight. I was within their acceptable weight range (which was only 17 pounds higher than the upper "healthy" limit for my height), but because I had recently lost 30 pounds they refused me and told me to try again in six months, so they could "be sure I'd keep the weight off." I've visited insurance companies as part of my previous job. I've seen the 40 acre professionally landscaped site with walking paths and lakes. I've eaten in the executive lunch rooms and employee cafeterias that served better food than most restaurants I've been to. I've seen the three story fountains in the lobby, and I know one company in particular that as a matter of policy closes its doors at noon on Fridays in the summer. When my premiums go to fund the insurance company's private fitness club, I have a problem.
