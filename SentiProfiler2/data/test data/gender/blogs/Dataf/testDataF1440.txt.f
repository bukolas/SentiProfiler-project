This morning, i prayed the "Prayer of Faith" and i heard the Lord's gentle voice said , "Let it be so." and it was so . All day, i felt Jesus touching me and to me i had felt a big difference in me. I felt the Holy Spirit all over me and it was so amazing. I kept on thinking Jesus all morning and into the evening. The definition of faith is in Hebrews 11:1. What made thought of Jesus was this song "I could only imagine"
