I lost my mother to radical breast cancer which kept spreading throughout her body. She had five different operations and chemo therapy before she died. I just had radical prostate surgery a week ago Tuesday and today found out there is a 30% chance there is still some left but need to wait 6 weeks to see where we are. I have high hopes as I have 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson who are very concerned. We are keeping them informed and positive. I hope this is what you are looking for.
