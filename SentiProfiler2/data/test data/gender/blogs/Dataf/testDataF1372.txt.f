Dear friends of Bubby, Six years ago we started a blog with our grandmother, Bubby, as a way to share her wise advice with the world. We knew that everyone would love her wit, candor and compassion. This little experiment soon turned into something more special than we could have ever imagined. Within months, Bubby was receiving letters from thousands of people around the world, pouring out their hearts, and sharing their most personal stories with our grandmother. She loved offering her help. She loved reading your letters every day. She was so proud to be a Bubby to all of you. Sadly, last night, we lost our Bubby. At 94, she was still beautiful. Thank you for all of your contributions over the years. You helped make her life that much more special. With love, the granddaughters Reader Update! In July of 2006, we received a letter from a 29-year old woman with a broken heart . And this wasn't the first time she had to pick up the pieces. She and her fiance were supposed to be married in 2005, but he called it off and they parted ways. 6 months later he found his way back to her, begged for forgiveness, re-proposed, and she accepted. A few months went by and he called off the wedding again. But of course he kept her dangling and her hopes for a third reunion remained high. When you hear a story like this, you want to yell from the rooftops, "FORGET HIM!" But as we all know, the heart can be hard-of-hearing sometimes. And this girl needed some advice. Leave it to Bubby to set things straight. Bubby wasted no time referring to this man as an " immature fellow ." She wrote, " I recommend you forget him and if he calls, just tell him the party is over... There are many fish in the sea and I am sure there is one who is looking for you... Life with this person will never happen. I wish you all the happiness in the world." Even an anonymous commenter left a note saying: " Bubby's quite right. If he breaks it off once, and comes back, and all's well, fine. We all make mistakes, and we all have doubts. If he breaks it off twice?! Run, and never look back." There is nothing we love more at this website than an update letter with a happy ending. So we are pleased to report that nearly 3 years to the date of this original posting, we heard from this woman again. What do you think happened? Did he finally grow a pair? Did she learn her lesson? Did she take Bubby's advice?" Read on to find out... Dear Bubby, I wanted to write to up-date you and to thank you for the very good advice you gave me some three years ago now. My then fiance had called off our wedding for the second time and I was so distressed. You said I should forget this immature person who had wasted so much of my time. I took your advice and it really really worked out! After deciding to end all contact with my ex-fiance, I worked hard on my career and found a fantastic new job. The very first month I met a colleague in another department and, in time, we fell in love. We married last year and are now expecting our first child. With my ex, everything was difficult. With my now husband, everything is easy - we can really talk and he is so kind, fun and gentle. And, he was, from the beginning, absolutely sure about me. He is also supportive of my career as we work in the same field, something my ex never was. Really, he just cares deeply about my happiness and I couldn't imagine that I could ever love someone as much as I love him. I never would have found this wonderful man if I hadn't taken your advice. Anyway, just to thank you. Writing to you and receiving your sensible response was a great comfort to me then, and I am so grateful I listened to your wisdom. Wishing you and your family every happiness, No longer 'Heart-broken all over again.' Thank you!! xo, the granddaughters and Happy Passover! Searching for the afikomen Can be quite a chore Tipsy from the wine you drank Glasses, 1 to 4. Filling up on matzah brie Children ask, "On this night, why...?"

One of her granddaughters is turning 31 this week! We'll be visiting Bubby over the weekend to celebrate with her. Plus, rumor is we're going to be baking hamentashins with her too. Now that's what Bubby calls a party. (By the way, if you need the recipe again, here it is . And here's the baking video we made last year.) But, back to the aging process. Here are some great birthday-themed letters that have been sent to Bubby over the years: Is it approrpriate to have a Jewish baby naming ceremony for a boy on his first birthday ? Why did he act so distant at my birthday party even though he drove 2 hours to see me? Bubby thinks you should take a cold shower and wait until your 16th birthday party. My husband forgot my birthday , what should I do? If I pretend you are my Bubby, will you send me a birthday gift? Why don't you buy him a nice broadcloth shirt or a slipover sweater for his birthday ? My boyfriend had fun on his 21st birthday , but I haven't yet. Should I marry him? Best to everyone! What an historic day! Bubby couldn't be more pleased to see Barack Obama become our new president. She was glued to CNN just like the rest of the world. Can you imagine how it must feel to be 93 and see such a pivotal moment in history?? To commemorate the day, we decided to remind you of some great letters Bubby has responded to over the years that were related to politics. Bubby reflects on Bush Bush talks to the CIA How to become President of your company How to become Vice President of your company Reflections on Reagan's funeral ceremony love, the granddaughters With the economy being what it is today, and stock markets holding your dreams at bay, your financial woes may make you shed a tear, and overdose on panic and fear. But Bubby just smiles and to us she'll say, "Don't forget. Money is round... It can roll towards you, or away." Here are some of the best "money questions" Bubby has responded to over the years. How can I retire and still take care of everyone? I'm 13 and I really, really need a job If I stayed in India I would have no money problems! My husband is so stressed about our finances I want to make more money before I propose My best friend just won a million dollars I have 7 kids to support but I hate my job love, the granddaughters Another year has gone by... Another birthday is here to celebrate. HAPPY 93 rd BUBBY! love, everyone Post your birthday wishes to Bubby in the comments below. Happy Rosh Hashana! Bubby and her granddaughters wish all of you a happy and healthy new year. Over the years we have received so many (thousands!) of touching, endearing, tearful, hopeful, soulful letters from people around the world, asking Bubby for life advice. We wish for all of you that your stories turn out happy and everyone sees all their dreams come true. And on that note, how 'bout a happy update letter ! On July 25, 2005 , we received a letter from a 25-year old woman living in Belgium who told Bubby she was planning to marry her boyfriend. She was looking for her first job after graduate school, but the only one available to her was far away in Paris. She wasn't excited about the job and didn't feel like it matched her qualifications. But she was afraid her parents would be mad if she didn't accept it. Bubby wrote her wisely, " It is a terrible feeling to get up in the morning and go to a job that you don't like or are not qualified for. Just give yourself more time to find the job for which you are trained and you are qualified." And then she added, " Don't worry about your boyfriend. If you really love one another distance will not make a difference." Bubby knows what long-distance love is like ! And she knew there was a way to solve this problem if everyone sat down to talk about it. " Put your thinking cap on!" Bubby told her. A few years went by, and on March 8, 2006 , we received a great update letter. They were still happily in love and getting married! She did find another job that she was much happier with, even though it still meant geographical distance for the couple. But they visited each other every weekend, and spoke on the phone every day. She wrote, " This is working, because we made it work, with lots of patience and love. Thanks for your nice advice to me when I asked for it... I'll send you another update for the wedding." Well, we're happy to report that she kept her word. This week we received another great update letter. She wrote: Dear Bubby, I am very happy to tell you that, due to my good job and good fortune, he was able to come join me in Paris to look for a job (which he found easily). We got married in April. We first met in 2003, and it was a difficult 5 years. We got through it, partly thanks to your advice. So thank you very much and take care. From, The Old Continent
