Nothing is FREE. Health Care has a cost. Other countries DO NOT HAVE FREE health care. They have HIGH taxes that pay for the cost. So why increase our taxes to get minimal and lower quality health care. The paper work , payroll, cost of service, RX etc need to be looked at and regulated. If we had a better tax code --- ie. no income tax- we would have more money in our pockets to decide what level of health care to purchase. The system could be better, yes but should not be handle by the government. My concern is why does it have to be tied to our jobs?
