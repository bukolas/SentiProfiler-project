Saturday the 10th of May 2008, turned out to be a pleasant and sunny surprise. I got up in the morning, quite early for Saturday standards, and decided to get geeky. So I went around the libraries of the Uni, finally found the books I wanted, and borrowed them. But somehow I was not happy about studying in the serious and studious atmosphere of the library. So I decided to get back to Insterburg (my hostel) and have lunch, and think about it. As I was cooking, I asked my corridor mates, who were lunching, where they studied usually..

Anyway, after 3 hours of studying, or maybe a bit more, we went to the Marktplatz to have an icecream, and walked around a bit, and finally rode back. For me, the entire aspect of studying outside was refreshing, after realizing that I am a computer addict, crouched all day on my laptop.
