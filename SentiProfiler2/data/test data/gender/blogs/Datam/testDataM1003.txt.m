I was traveling by a public transport this evening of 17th Feb 2010. It was crowded. Hundreds of strangers packed in one iron box(bus). They were breathing over each others shoulders yet complete strangers. People. Thankfully I was sitting by the window seat. While I was looking at the people I was completely taken aback with one thought that hit me.
The only thing in my life that I have not seen getting exhausted are the "people". They are everywhere. Every day and every point of a life thriving on this planet. I remember observing and wondering at People when I was a little unknown kid. The old aged people I used to see when I was a kid are still trudging here in gray. The young beautiful girls of teens and 20s are still running around in colors. The little noisy kids are still going to schools and playing in the playgrounds. The middle aged working men are still tuned with their robotic lives. The shopping, gossiping women are still here. I have been growing up since 24 years and I have seen so many things getting exhausted. The huge green, cool-shaded trees are not seen anymore. The small beautiful streets are not small anymore. I don't see an intense rainy season or feel a freezing winter anymore. I don't see the radiant rainbows arcing a green valley. The childhood days aint here anymore. No more small cozy houses. They are all exhausted. But people are still here. They are everywhere. Everything has changed but for the people. Thousands die everyday and millions every year. But the people are never exhausted. They have become like a layer on the planet.
I wonder if God can find a 24year old sand grain on the beach.
