ow do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. So this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me.

but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. So my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? The current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.

i want to know how you would deal with a person you cant quite get rid of...
Well for those that don't know I am taking 10 freshman kids from school to the Grand Canyon over spring break! Yes I have lost my mind....
No I really am excited... I think! We leave early Monday morning for the airport to fly to Las Vegas. Then we fly out the red eye friday night!  So yes I am spending my Spring Break with KIDS what am I thinking? I am sure it will be a vacation I will never forget!
I dont know why its taken me so long to realize most people don’t live with principles in their lives? I guess since I was raised to carry myself with some integrity...I figured others did the same. No good deed goes unpunished. This I learned the hard way. Humans do not realize they are the very cause of their own demise. In this myriad of complexities we call the matrix or cyber world. People become lost. Hiding behind their pc or phone screen. Playing dress-up for their webcam or camphone. No real friends or relationships. Nothing tangible. Me? I like to be able to reach out n touch someone. Whether it be to show love or put tips on em. Old skool stilo. Just know in my life..Integrity exists. Dignity is honored. Principles matter. When I leave Gods green Earth I can take those with me. The matrix is all an illusion so doesn’t be mislead.
It started raining Friday morning. And it rained. And then it rained. And then it really rained.

In the wee early hours of Saturday morning the wind became frenzied. An endless whistle punctuated by roaring gusts. The kind of wind that either mutes all other sounds or distorts them into something ominous.

Is that the trees moving? Or is there an army of ninjas crawling on the roof? 

Our backyard and the suburban crap sprawl beyond it inclines toward the house. Not the smartest groundbreaking move but it’s really fine as long as you have a French drain around the foundation.

We do not have a French drain.

We do however have a lovely lakeside view.
I'm sitting at my computer on this chilly autumn morning with a gentle breeze floating through my very open window. I can see tall trees and a families backyard and i hear men's voices as they walk around preparing to demolish the house located just behind mine. I hear trucks, cars and buses on the road, the occasional horn and birds singing their cares away and chattering among themselves.

Today I'm more expressing a thought then a questions, will the world really change so severely in the next couple of years that if i were doing this in ten years i wouldn't hear the noises or see the trees? well i know that by next week i wont see the trees, the block of land they are located on is being flattened so that contractors can build housing commission flats on it.

The whether has gotten a lot chillier since autumn began a few weeks ago, i wrap a blanket around myself every time i leave my bed in the morning. I like the mornings that i look back at my bed after leaving it and i see my partner still laying there sleeping peacefully with his head now laying on the very same pillow mine just left. Its lonely mornings like this one that i dislike.

On days like this i wonder about my future, will i achieve all the goals i want to achieve, will i help, will i still be with him? then i casually shake my head and forget about them, its no use worrying over what is going to happen in a few years when you don't even know what might be happening that very day....
I am getting increasingly irritated by the minute. I wish people around me could get over their own inconsequential lives and stop bringing their negativity into the lives of others. I am beyond the point where I can offer empty consolation and sugar-coated words just to seem 'nice'. I am tired of people who sulk around all day thinking about their own humongous huge issues and 'problems' and spoil life for EVERY body. Just suck it in and continue to do what you have to do; THAT is where the strength lies, not in pretending defiance at the mere hint of another trying to make light the situation, which they probably are doing to make YOU feel better and realize how infinitesimal and pointless your gargantuan 'issues' are.
The weather's turned, and the old neighbors creep out from their crammed rooms to blink in the sun, as if surprised to find they've lived through another winter.

Though steam heat's left them pale and shrunken like old root vegetables,
Mr. and Mrs. Tozzi are already hard at work on their front-yard mini-Sicily:
a Virgin Mary birdbath, a thicket of roses, and the only outdoor aloes in Manhattan.
It's the old immigrant story, the beautiful babies grown up into foreigners. Nothing's turned out the way they planned as sweethearts in the sinks of Palermo. Still, each waves a dirt-caked hand in geriatric fellowship with Stanley, the former tattoo king of the Merchant Marine, turning the corner with his shaggy collie, who's hardly three but trots arthritically in sympathy. It's only the young who ask if life's worth living, notMrs. Sansanowitz, who for the last hour has been inching her way down the sidewalk, lifting and placing her new aluminum walker as carefully as a spider testing its web. On days like these, I stand for a long time under the wild gnarled root of the ancient wisteria, dry twigs that in a week will manage a feeble shower of purple blossom, and I believe it: this is all there is, all history's brought us here to our only life to find, if anywhere, our hanging gardens and our street of gold:
cracked stoops, geraniums, fire escapes, these old stragglers basking in their bit of sun.
Wow...has three years already passed??  Neither of us can believe it.  It seems like yesterday that we just met.  It's unimaginable the love we share.  Regardless of our past and present we look on to the future as a family.  I admit, we didn't know each other for too long until we just clicked.  We saw each other's pain and mended it.  We are each other's missing piece in the most uncomprehensible  jigsaw puzzle fitting right into place.  We've had our fights, but we learn from them and grow stronger.  We have our special moments and grow stronger.  We discuss everything and hide nothing and grow stronger.
Everyone tells him how lucky he is to have me at his side, but yet they don't understand that I am incredibly lucky to have him at my side.  Alex is the type of guy that every guy wishes they could be and that every girl would want.  Sure he has his downfalls, but if you don't accept them and help your love up, that is your downfall.  We have shared our past to each other and our ex's, but together we laugh and say how far we've come to finally meet the right person to wake up to and enjoy life with.  There is no better way to grow but through experience and communication with no restraints.  No lies, no hidden messages.  Just straight forward truth and compassion.
We are always supportive of each other through whatever endeavor.  If we disagree, we discuss; and from that we understand each others points and come to conclusion.
I'm not materialistic like his past relations and that's what he loves.  I keep him happy as any woman should to his man.  We are our own person and there is no better way to be expressed.  I'm quite a goofy one so it always makes him smile.  Seeing him smile is such a joy it makes me smile.  Now we have Sasha as well and she just helps us grow even more closer.  His mother and I adore each other and confide in each other so dearly.  We are the best of friends.  Our small family may be small, but in our hearts we are as big and robust as the night time sky if not more.  Three years have just gone by so fast.....We all await for what the future holds for us as our love grows stronger.
After college and getting settled in a new job I decided that it was time for a new chapter in life. So I moved into my very own place. Yes 23 and just moving out. I knew this would be a very difficult move because I had never even stayed overnight away from home but maybe 3 times. Boy was I right! So I called in for reinforcements. Jodi and Kristy to save the day. We all needed to get away for our own reasons so this was the perfect time. We would watch Tom Cruise movies and eat popcorn until we got sick. Painting the house was a damn good time considering that none of us was 100% sure of what was going on. Thank God  for family. Who knows what that place would have looked like. After the newest wore off and everybody got into something else, there I was all alone again. I still had family but I needed someone. So I had lost some weight and was feeling pretty good about myself so I called up Jodi and told her we needed to get together. She had been through a divorce recently so she was ready.
I do not seem to be able to stay current with anything lately and blogging has been the worst. I am trying to keep up with assignments in my Web Design class, keep my lia sophia business afloat, which means calls and organization and keeping up with paper work, trying to keep my house clean and attempting to get some long overdue redecorating done. Which brings me to this picture? 
Remember when my son moved home for 6 months and we repainted his room in the color of his choice? Well this room is now my office (with another cardboard creation homework assignment from Sadie's art teacher stored here). It is BRIGHT! Not in a good way.
I don't want to admit how long it took me to figure out what these are called. As soon as I figured it out I said, "duh, I knew that." Sea Urchins, or Echinoids (dead), in case you were wondering. I'm glad I saved some poor soul the time searching on Google for "round, hollow sea creature", or "spherical sea creature" or "circular coral reef animal", because I certainly did not spend a lot of time doing the same thing, nope, not me.

And now that I am done wasting time on the internet looking up round sea animals I will now go waste more time on the internet stalking people on Facebook.

This has been a public service announcement brought to you by a procrastinating graduate student that just wants to go home right now. Have a nice day :)
Then there was my life, which had fallen apart. All I was left with was the thought that I has tried, really tried and nothing in my life worked and my psychic pain was worse. God, I thought was either ignoring me or he just did not think I had prayed the right prayers, thought the right thoughts, gone to church enough, repented enough, suffered enough, believed enough, done enough, or was just not good enough. And I was very, very angry at Him.

After awhile I gave up and recently decided that I would try to fix me, to save me myself. Then I gave up on God again. And it has been wonderful. My therapist is helping me find hope in, to accept, to connect with, to believe in, myself. I have reached points where I just want to crawl out of my hole and join a wonderful world. When I have those moments where I can't take 'it,' where my childhood demons overwhelm me and I want to get away, I retreat into my room, but I don't want to crawl in a hole anymore. I am open to the ideal that there is indeed something 'else.' Something nurturing, kind, loving, in this universe but I am looking for that within myself.
She loves to wear dresses while she plays trains and cars. She tromps through the mud in her pink tights. Rarely leaves the house without a necklace or bracelet, but runs faster than the boys and hasn't met a jungle gym she can't conquer, even at 2 3/4.

The day I snapped this shot with my phone, we spent quite a bit of time shoe shopping, just for fun. She loves red heels, just like I do. (I would have bought these, but they were too big for both of us.) We giggled and pranced in the isles of Ross, trying on silly shoes we didn't need just because it was fun and they were really inexpensive, anyway.

I am so proud of my little girl. She is her Grandma Judeen's granddaughter. I have no doubt that she, too, will be bailing hay in a miniskirt or stomping across the cow pasture without looking down, perfectly accessorized.
I get so emotional and then I laugh, we humans are really something.
I can enjoy reading debates on subjects that I have no opinion about but when it comes to subjects where I have choosen a point of view that is very deep in my heart I shun away and I can't continue reading. I do not want to comment.

Right now people are fighting for the right to home school in Sweden, as some religious family made some bad choices based on their beliefs. There is an article about how children learn(link below) that I agree with. I wish I had the chance to live like this when I was young. I sometimes do not understand my own children´s choices to attend school and all the things (restrictions) that goes with that.

Freedom for me is so important but I will respect my children´s choices now as well as when they grow up. Although every now and then (too often, Elena says) I ask if she wants to quit school and I reminded her how nice it was before school. FYI Elena started school when she was 9, and I am happy she waited that long at least.

Anyway I am getting lots of emails from the Swedish homeschooling group about articles and ofcourse there is lots of comments on the subject. Some are so uphauling that it is just amazing to me how we as humans can have such extreme opposite beliefs. But that is really okay. What turns my stomach is how people can judge and condemn others for their beliefs.
Well, I was just in the middle of it today and did not feel so good.
I know it can be lonely to be a warrior (my favorite definition, from Stuart Wild, I mean different from mass consciousness) but it sure is worth it.
The world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that Olivier Dupon from Dossier37 is one of them. He is known to many Sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop Lola Et Moi, which he ran for about three years, and now the rest of the world is getting to know his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog Dossier37. Olivier kindly shared these pics with Daily Imprint of his home in Pyrmont. As he describes it, "Great views, great light... We use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks and designer pieces."
Born in Brooklyn and now living in the not so wide open spaces of NJ. I have a 35 year old son - yes I was a knocked up teen - he and his wife share a Mother/Daughter type home with me. I run my own business - used to have an office but now work out of home. I often work a second job to pay for Internet service. I have 2 rescued cats.
I have become just a little bit wrapped up in this weight loss process and all the new things I am discovering about me, my habits around food, alternative forms of exercise, and life in general.  I have shared all of my thoughts with you on this blog but I really don’t want this blog to be a weight loss blog.  

I started Living The Life Of Tere to be about my life, my family, my thoughts.  Me, Me, Me.  Weight loss is a part of my life but it is not the only part of me.  But I had things I wanted to share with others about weight loss, things that have helped friends and others.  I started to put off writing here about some funny things my kids did and other stories so I could post some weight loss stories.  That’s not really where I wanted things to go.

I decided I needed to compartmentalize my life a bit when it comes to sharing my life with others.  So I did something that makes no sense with the small amount of time I have . . . I started a separate weight loss blog.  One where I can share my thoughts on weight loss, food diary, successes and failures, low calorie recipes, tips and tricks from others, reviews of products, other people’s success stories . . . for those that are interested in that type of thing.
We were friends along the way, sharing postcards, phone calls, fudge, pasta developed for diabetics, and videos of Bill the dog. We figured out ways to get along regardless of our differences. 

You were part of my life for over two years and now you are gone. No more "yer" this and "yer" that. No more emails outside of MySpace, that most others knew nothing about. I always appreciated your consideration for my feelings.

When we first met, sometime in 2007 or 2008, you didn't think you would live until Christmas of that year. But you did. Count that as extra gravy. But I know it hasn't been easy extra time. With all my heart, I hope you just went to sleep the other night and never woke up. 

Sleep well with peaceful dreams, Sweetpea. We won't forget you.
Where I come from it’s….

A small island of the coast of North Carolina called “Cape Hatteras Island,” known for the tallest Lighthouse in our nation. It’s also known for its beaches, white sands, surfing waves, and it’s treacherous Diamond Shoals. It has a very rich, full history in many areas of our past; wars, pirates, and tourism. Many stories fill my head and my heart over flows with the memories I myself have on that little sandy beach I called home for most of my life. 

My family moved to Cape Hatteras when I was a very young girl, I believe I began the 3rd grade there on the island. We moved across the states from Bremerton Washington with my father’s job in the US Navy. Of course moving to the island at that time brought great change in my life and back then it truly was just a little island, full of mom and pop shops and restaurants, little tourism, and 1 full military base.

As a child our days were spent; playing with the neighboring children, playing in the park, or making a trip over the dunes to play at the beach. In many ways it was ideal yet in today’s society by many standards it would be considered lacking on so many levels.
The other day I was so lucky as to be able to spend time at one of my favorite places. It's a place I hope to spend the vast majority of my summer. (Second to work, I suppose, but let's not think about that now) Shortly after arriving, I ran into a friend and inquired as to his well being.

He replied, "Oh, perfect! If I won the lottery, it'd be a step down!" 

I love it. I feel the same way, surrounded by such awesome people in my life.
Hospital waiting rooms have wi-fi now. Isn't that great? And it's noisy in here. I didn't expect that. We are swapping stories about my MIL who has not been married to my FIL for years. MIL travels with food. Half-eaten food. Want some coffee cake? I couldn't leave it behind, it was so good. That kind of thing.

My SIL is here in Dayton from Madison, WI. Other SIL, from Chicago, will come in later this week, tag team hospital visits. The plan, medico-wise, is to remove a goodly portion of FILs left lung, and follow up with chemotherapy. Because he actually has a chance to survive this thing, FIL has quit smoking. So far, anyway. His wife is working on it. SIL from Madison will be taking regular smoke-breaks during the day. 

We are working on our explorations of the kitchen-infested, extended-stay hotels in the south Dayton area. Last night's was not as nice as the last one we stayed in, but it was fifty bucks cheaper for the night. So there's that. And I am never one to pass up a free breakfast.

The back pain is subsiding, which is good. I am being very careful with it, to maintain. Thanks to everyone for all your good wishes, both for me and for Husband's dad. If the waiting gets long or boring, I'll hop on and write some more, and I'll post any updates we hear. For now I'll post because I am a total comment whore. Shut up. No wait. Don't shut up. I mean shut up about me being a comment whore.

I think I've had too much coffee this morning.
How do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis.

The current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.
There are many things in life that make me happy. Little things, things that just make me smile. One of my favorites is Post Secret Sundays. Post Secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named Frank. Frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. Write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the address already written on the card. It grew into quite a phenomena. Now, Frank gets postcards from all over the world. He's compiled them and published more than one book. And every Sunday, Frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. Even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed.

Every Sunday, I log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. It's a simple pleasure that I truly enjoy. The secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful.

Everyone has secrets. Little secrets, like you really don't like your friend's new haircut. Unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). And big, important secrets, ones you don't even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it.
Woke up around 11 am and realised that I most likely was DYING. The horror...! THE HORROR...! It should be said that I deal with illness like a man, an over-dramatic man. So I phoned my doctor, seeing as I'm Stockholm-bound for Friday and didn't feel like suffering from intense ear-ache on my flight. Managed to eat an apple. One apple a day does NOT keep the doctor away.
Walking to the doctors it was hard not to feel giddy though (in spite of my case of the DEATH). It was so sunny and warm, flowers everywhere and I could really feel how this was it. Winter is well and truly over! Bumped in to my friend Nat, out for some fresh air with a friend. Nat was equally ill, and her friend had tonsillitis. Poor us.
Walking back home from the doctors I spotted this book in the Childrens Bookshop in Bruntsfield. I had to stop and buy it for my own (not so) hugless Douglas. You can see part of his hairy leg in the picture above. The likeness with a fussy bear is striking.
My new bedding was delivered! Ooooh, all white, crisp and new! Sat on it with Doris the ukulele for a while, feeling all summery and happy.
That one day, the world will change, and people will start realizing how beautiful life really is. I pray that one day the world will be rid of liars, cheaters, and thieves. &if not rid of, than those people will see that their actions actually do affect others. I pray that their eyes will be opened, and they will start to feel the way that God feels toward His children. I pray for the rid of ignorance and foolishness. I pray for the rid of selfishness. I pray that God's hands will protect the hearts of the ones who live for Him, and pity those who never believed. I pray that God will bless those in need of strength and courage. I pray no punishment. But I do pray for the people who need to get what they deserve. I pray that people who don't care, will start to. And people who do care get what they need out of everything. Life isn't about wanting things for yourself. It's about loving those who you easily provide for. Materials are nothing without the feeling of loving what you have. The thankful feeling you receive when blessed by things that you love. I pray that anger will be lifted off of my shoulders. I pray that God will give me the strength to lift my head up and walk with positive energy. I pray that God will give me the strength to forgive those who I feel I cannot forgive, and help those to forgive me for the wrongs I've caused upon them. &I pray, that one day God will help me believe that this is all worth it, and happiness is really obtainable.
Today was one of those I should really get up and do something, but I don't wanna kind of days! So I didn't! I Hung out with my wonderful husband and sweet kids. 

Poor Hunter came home from his sleepover really sick. As soon as he walked in our front door I knew he was sick! Then I felt him and I he said "Mom, I feel terrible." He broke my heart. He is running a fever and has a bad cough. If I don't see an improvement in him by tomorrow, I'm going to take him to the ER. Hunter is so thin and frail as it is because he isn't the best eater, so we kind of panic when he gets sick at all.

Anyway, other then Hunter being sick, our weekend is lazy and good! I like it when Mark is off work and the kids are home from school and we can all just be together. Our weekdays are so crazy and busy, so the weekends are a time to be together.

Everyone is gathered around the t.v. right now watching America's Most Wanted. Okay, I know not the best family show, but we all love COPS and America's Most Wanted and we never miss it on Saturday night.
Alex is now 3.5 months old and doing great. He has found his hands and they are normally in his mouth. He is great at assisted standing and sitting. He has all kinds of sounds. Goo, hoo, oooh and ahhh. Bouncing in the bath is his favorite activity. His friends Elliott (Zoe's brother) and Maude (Max's sister) were born at the end of November. So they are only a couple of months be hind him. Max had his second birthday right after Christmas. We got to see him open on present. Nathan helped with the rest. Alex loves to be held when awake. As soon as he is sleeping he wants to be put down in a quiet place. As far as sleep he does ok. Currently he is sleeping from 9pm-1am and then up again at 4 and 6 or 7. This would be fine with me but Nathan has been getting up at 3. Make for a long morning.
Ok so you know how when you to anywhere they want to know what you're allergic to? Well my answer was always nothing. But now I have an answer. Anything in the Factive family. It took two trips to the hospital and alot of itching to figure it out. I have a few pictures in the "people you know abulm" for you to see but man it's a you had to of been there kind of thing. But with the great nurse I have helping me with my oatmeal baths and slathering down of the old sticky lotion I'll make it through just fine. Man you got to love a good nurse!

2-9-08 You know I'm still not sure that I was having a reaction. I have had sooo many kids with the same rash at school. Poor kids!
I love The Biggest Loser and believe it can truly motivate people to get help when they can’t figure out how to help themselves but the contestants get bigger and their stories sadder each season. All fat people are not sad. Some of us have dated and been loved and really like ourselves but want to live healthy, active lives so we change our bad habits and work hard to get rid of the weight we so blindly allowed to take over. But people need to realize that being skinny is a lot like winning the lottery. It’s great and some things are easier but all your emotional issues are still there until you DO something about them. 

Maybe self-confidence really WAS my problem. I was ok, my life was ok. I was happy. So I never did anything about the weight that kept creeping on. I have done something about it several times over the last few years but really only half-heartedly, because I felt like I SHOULD. But I am doing it this time and I am very serious about it.
I just love and cherish the place where I was born because I am a friend, cousin, niece and granddaughter of people who reside in Israel. I also happen to LOVE the scenery, food, and environment of my homeland.
Fine, so I lied a bit. I would hate to see Israel non-existent or unrecognized. Which definitely means I am NOT anti-Israel. I'm also pro-peace. Glad we got that out of the way...

A little history on how I got into this whole pro-Israel mess:
I was born in Rishon Le-Tzion, Israel. I lived there until I was eight, except for a brief year when my parents decided to venture off to Hong Kong and get all these stamps on my passport from all of Eastern Asia. Too bad all I have is the passport...
I moved to the Silicon Valley where I only started to value and recognize my Israeli identity in high school.
I got really involved in a youth group called Tzofim, and dreamed of joining the Israel Defense Forces after high school as early as freshman year.
I spent every summer vacation in Israel during my high school years. Summers were all I looked forward to.
Did I mention the Silicon Valley has a huge Israeli community? Well this was a huge factor for my ability to stay connected to my culture instead of diving into the big melting pot of american society.

Well as it turns out, there aren't many Israelis in San Diego, where I go to school. Thus, when looking to get involved with the Israeli community at UCSD, I was right away pointed to the direction of Israel advocacy. This is where this whole pro/anti thing comes in. Israel advocacy is basically feeding everyone and their mom the greatness of Israel through it's diversity, innovations, and did I mention- it is the only democracy in the middle east? It's making sure Jews are pro-Israel and non-Jews are simply not anti. Sometimes, I feel as if it one big brainwash. But I live for it.

So.
I'm going to Israel this summer simply to enjoy every beautiful (and humid) moment.
I am at the beach on Spring Break.  Not my Spring Break but my daughter's.  Several months ago, Daughter and her friends decided they were going to the beach for Spring Break.  They planned, they analyzed, they researched then realized that they needed someone older to rent a place and it was going to take a lot more money than they thought.  So they invited the Moms.  

Don't get me wrong . . . I don't feel used.  How many 20 year olds would even consider taking their moms along with them on Spring Break?  We are actually quite honored.  And we are having fun.
What if you could have forty million dollars completely tax free... but you could never spend more than two days in the same city. This means that you'd have to move all your stuff every two days.  

You could rotate cities, but you'd have to put three cities in between every rotation.  

So if you wanted to go back to whatever city you're from you would have to make sure you stayed six days at three other cities before going back.

Would you take the money and resign yourself to the life of a nomad or would you stay put and live where you wanted for however long you wanted?

I don't know what I’d do.  If I took the money I’d definitely invest in an rv.  i don't know if I could do that forever though.  Not having to work ever would be nice, but I may want to stay somewhere sometimes.  

What would you do?
I am a sucker for a Liberty print. I still have several items, including a paisley bag, which I bought from the store when I used to live in London. So it's no surprise that I like these pretty - in a old-fashioned yet contemporary way - baby clothes from Elki. It was started by sisters Emma and Georgina who grew up in a creative home. Emma went on to study visual communication and become a graphic designer while Georgina studied fashion. Emma lives in central west NSW while Georgie is based in Bowral. The sisters import the fabric from Liberty of London and design and make the products themselves.
I love the atmosphere the olympics are stirring up in my city. I love how I can get downtown after a 20 minute bus ride and experience granville street at its best. The colours, smells, sounds and feelings of patriotism breathes Vancouver new life. Nightlife is more expensive, but hey, it's a great time to be barely legal. With the exception of day one (and today), our city has been enjoying some of the best weather it's seen in February. 

Things haven't been perfect though. With the tragic death of the Georgian luger on day 1, the untimely death of Canadian figure skater Joannie Rochette's mother, unseasonal, warm weather, the disappointment of some Canadian medal hopefuls...and not to mention the failure to bring the fourth pillar up for the opening ceremonies (lol, FAIL) we've been good sports. We're handling it well. The enthusiasm for the games is contagious.

let's discuss what this word means to us. to me it's one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace "interesting" but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him "weird" was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don't quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the oddest looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i'm called "weird", even though i'm sure it's often not meant that way :)

google image "weird" and this is the first thing that comes up. see how great it is?
I like...flipping my blankets over to the cold side when I sleep, the smell of sun-dried laundry, back scratches, food, the winter's first snowfall, beach days, wallowing in music on a gloomy, wet vancouver day, crazy moments with people that I am crazy for, nail polish, avocados, big warm hugs, large meadows that are frolick-a-ble, the summertime, qoola, french, leggings, tea, metal water bottles, school supply shopping, salmon cream cheese, and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone.
It's been more than a month since I posted anything here. There is so much to do, plus my mood has been off. But I am finding myself really missing the journaling aspect of blogging, especially therapeutic journaling. Blogger, heal thyself!

I have a week's (unpaid) vacation from my job, and today I am cleaning house as I work on my to-do list. Sewing, decorating, and gardening are how I would most like to spend this time. More moving-in and organizing have to be on the plan as well. Some priorities are (bleh!) taxes and fencing (*sigh*) to keep the boy dogs from fighting. 

Dunno why, but I DID NOT EXPECT THIS!! Harley is not the simple laid-back, big squishy teddy bear he appears to be, and has now decided to make his move for dominance. Or is it his intention to completely eliminate the competition? I can't tell. As he grew much larger than Frankie, he began to show a little more aggression in regard to being close to his people and being first for treats. Less than a week after his neutering, we had an incident over a collar and leash they both wanted (to them, these evidently mean being singled out for special treatment) and ended up with a badly wounded Frankie, and also a wounded Mama (me). Poking your finger into a fighting St. Bernard's mouth is not the best idea for breaking his hold. Four days later my fingers on the other hand were also injured and Frankie's wounds were opened, and I learned that this was not something we were going to be able to put behind us for a long time, if ever.

One of the happiest parts of my daily life has been sharing it with my three dogs, so you can imagine how bummed I am feeling. At all times, one of them must be either outside, in the laundry room, or in the crate. Coordinating their quality time inside and out is very unsatisfying for all and very time-consuming for me. We did find a really good article on this type of aggression, which has given us some hope, and our next plan is to install a good gate in the middle of the house and to create a separation of yards outside. Otherwise, we will have to find Harley a new home where he can be the only dog, without competition for affection and attention.

Damn.
Finally! I got a full day's work done. Almost 4k, and if my hand hadn't started hurting I would have gotten even more done.

There's nothing I hate more than wanting to go go go and my body won't let me. Grr. But I'm finally past the three-quarter mark on Hecate's Own and I'm about to write the big showdown, save-the-day scene, after which there will be food, sex, and more food, knowing Zach. Once that's done, it's time for the Meat Grinder and the Beta Readers while I switch gears and begin serious work on Norwegian Wood.

I keep thinking I'm missing something, though. Something important. Hopefully it will come out in the Meat Grinder and I'll slap myself silly, fix it and move on. If not, my Betas will find it, slap me silly, and I'll fix it and move on.

I haven't gotten the artwork yet on Mating Games, and I'm still waiting for word on Noble Blood, but I knew I would be. Laurie was swamped with Red Hot Fairy Tale submissions, so for everyone who's waiting to hear the fate of Duncan, Jaden and Moira hopefully I'll have word no later than the end of April.

Oh! And if you've emailed me and I haven't responded, please email me again! I've been so caught up I may have missed it. Our oldest graduates grade school this year, we're planning a trip to Disney and I've got RT coming up, so when I'm able to sit at the computer I've been concentrating a lot on that stuff since writing wasn't much of an option the last few weeks.

I know. Bad author. No cookie for me.

P.S. Samhain Publishing is hosting the second annual Sammie Awards at the Samhain Cafe this Sunday! I'll be there if I have to sit Dusty down and make HIM type for me! Hope to see you there!
Oh friends, it's finally here! I thought the month between Christmas break and midwinter break wouldn't be too slow and awful. I told myself I wouldn't take any days off, and I succeeded in that. There was a pretty rough stretch for a bit, though, with that bunch of teachers leaving.

Loud Leo left our class a few weeks ago. A new boy came to the class, but has apparently left again. Buster, whom I have not yet mentioned, has remained a serious detriment to the class's focus and my patience (or lack thereof). Buster refuses to control himself most of the time. It's 'just' his mouth, but that means that when the rest of the class is quiet, he makes noise and distracts them and then never shuts up. And then other boys follow his lead and make more noise. GAH. He's really started to haunt me.

We had a party on Friday, that I'm not totally certain they deserved, but lord knows it had to be better than trying to force them to learn on the Friday afternoon before a week off. Our last lesson of the day was writing Valentine acrostics. About half of kids basically did nothing, but the rest did a poem, and a few of them turned out pretty well actually.

Anyway....we're here! Vacation! A whole week off! My favorite part is always the not waking up before dawn. Also the not being at school for so many hours. I didn't bring anything home with me, but I will go in for a few hours next week to work on unit planning. I've been behind for so long but too exhausted to do anything about it. I hope to remedy that, at least a little for now.

Also, happy Valentine's Day today! The boy and I had a wonderful day together, out and about.
