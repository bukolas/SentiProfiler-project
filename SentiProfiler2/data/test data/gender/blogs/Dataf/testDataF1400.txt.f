Last week my girl's & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away. Lou was my parent's pet & the girl's begged to take him home every time we visited. Lou got very sick & had to be "put to sleep". Last week my girl's & I found out some very sad news. A cat friend of ours passed away.
