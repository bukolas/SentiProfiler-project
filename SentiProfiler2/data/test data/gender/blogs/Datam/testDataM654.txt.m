We call him Israelu. This wonderful man has changed, is changing and will change the course of my life. Not only mine but also the life of few others.(Friend, philosopher and guide) But, its so sad to see his taking a roller coaster ride. (Eppadi irundha naa , ippadi ayitten). He is an energy bundle and his capability to channelize it makes him great. Never gets disappointed due to failures and he can keep doing the phoenix trick over n over again....
His ability to socialize, move around with people and tackle situations is really mind blowing. He just manipulates situations and can turn things upside down. OH man!!!! this ability increases when girls are around.(LOL :-)) For his mentality and attitude he should have become a lawyer or a diplomat. Thank god, such a thing never happ... or else we could have never met. A nice person to let out your feelings and secret... Somethings are bound to happen which is not under your control for which u shouldn't worry. SO just live the moment..
