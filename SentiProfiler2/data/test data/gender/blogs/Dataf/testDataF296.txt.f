I had Adrian's IEP meeting yesterday morning. They are always hard for me and I try to just walk away from it without crying, I didn't cry yesterday but it was very close. Present at the meeting was Adrian's teacher, speech pathologist, school counselor, a representative from the area education agency, and school principal. First they just went through everything from when he first started receiving services from the AEA until present day. We talked about his progress and whether or not he is still eligible for special education services, summer school, and door to door bus pickup. He's still eligible for all of those services. Next the school counselor brought out the Conner scale that myself and his teacher had filled out. He is rated “high” on many areas that would indicate ADHD but the counselor said you can't be sure whether or not some of those high ratings are from the autism or ADHD. She just said it's up to me, I can take this to the doctor and have him evaluated, it's just our choice how to proceed. I will take the charts to his doctor either next time we go or I'll make an appointment in the next month or so, I haven't decided yet because I think we're going to have to get a referral and go out of town to have him evaluated for ADHD. Next I talked to the speech pathologist. She just gave her report and is really impressed with how well he started to come along because apparently they had a rough start. Then his teacher discussed his goals, I think I'll write up a separate post about his actual goals because this will get too long. The only thing I was kind of surprised about was that the AEA rep was talking about how we need to make sure Adrian's goals will help him function in his life. For example, rather than teaching Adrian his days of the week we should be teaching him things like telling the difference between a men's restroom and a ladies restroom or that you should stop at a stop sign to be safe. It kind of turned into a thing where we were discussing whether or not he should be taught to read right now or not. I want Adrian to read, I think he's capable and he loves letters. The question is will he just memorize the words or will he really understand the meaning behind the words? I just didn't know what to say or think, I guess I wasn't prepared for that. I just assumed that the next step, since he knows all his letters and the sounds, that he would start to learn to read. Eventually we came to an agreement that the would add an extra goal, one for learning his sight words AND one for learning more functional skills. Basically it boils down to I want him to HAVE IT ALL! It was also a big joke that Adrian REALLY likes girls. He cuddles up next to girls, he approaches girls in the hallway, he tries to cuddle with all the female teachers. His teacher made the comment that they were having some college girls coming in to help in that classroom and that Adrian “was going to just love that!” They were all talking about how lovable he is and even when he's having a rough day it makes it so much easier because he's such a loving and sweet boy. Music to my ears. When I receive the actual IEP in paper I will post his goals. I wish I would have done more research on what I wanted his goals to be before I went so maybe our goals can help someone in the future. They had to make some changes to the IEP so I didn't get a copy yet.
