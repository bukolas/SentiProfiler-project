I wonder what I'll think of when I look back on this months from now.. So first I'd like to say - hi me! If I read this later... ;)

Anywaaay.umm. So lately my heart has been hurting and I know I've been pretty emo, but I think thatâ€™ll change now. Spent an awesome night with my brudder, got a Lovato pep-talk, and just spent time with my best friends (saw orphan - scaaaryy!!!!), so its just amazing. I'm happy.

Thank you all for that unconditional support you showed me, that's how I know I have the best fans in the whole wide world :)

You guys are seriously the absolute. Best.

I love you guys so so so so so much!! Your so amazing to me and I hope my music and my work expresses a small amount of how truly grateful I am for you. I cherish you from the bottom of my heart.

I love you!!!
Ps picture comments please :) xx.
Love always, XX,
