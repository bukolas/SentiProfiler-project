Last May, I wrote a two-part series entitled "Understanding Apple." (Part 1, Part 2) In it, I pointed out that, as someone who has followed the company extensively since 1981, I'd developed a pretty strong understanding of the way it had operated over the previous 27 years. I've also spent a lot of time with Apple's management team over the years, developing a pretty good understanding of why the company does what it does.
