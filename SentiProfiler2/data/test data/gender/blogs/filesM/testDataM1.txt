p.s. segreta : iitb's treasure hunt
Rush of imagination !  Raman Varman tried to cross a check-post that he crossed daily while going to his office. But he was stopped by a security personnel who said, “Sir, Indians are not supposed to enter through this way. You may take the next turn instead.”
“What do you mean Indians can’t enter. This is India. And it’s a silly check-post and not an international border !”
“You are wrong sir. Do you see that statue there ?”, he said pointing to a far white statue that was crowned and had a torch in its right raised hand.
“You are trying to enter America sir. And you know that the law...”
“Whhhhaaattt...oooo...wow...aaahhaaa...” Raman’s involuntary expressions rose from wonderment to more wonderment before the security-man knocked at the window glass of his car, “You are obstructing the traffic sir!”

Raman woke up in the midnight. He smiled, switched on the light, took his note book and drew a rough sketch of what he saw in the dream, closed the note book, switched off the light, smiled again, and slept.

Raman was a medical representative (MR) and had quit 3 firms earlier all on the same unique ground that MRs should be respected by the company coz they are most crucial in making a deal with docs n hospitals. Al Toro Pharma was his current place of work.

He saw weird things in his dreams and painted the same ASAP before the prints of the imagination became too dull to be transferred to the canvas. One day he dreamt the Qatub Minar just adjacent to Taj Mahal. He was happy to bring entirely 2 rules separated by 300 years too close. He had dreamt the water of Ganga going up the hills. He had rented a hall every inch of which was full of deep non-sense that had originated in his mind in the past. The paintings sell for handsome amount, and Raman soon became a known image in the locality, and quite unlike the SENSEX, the radius of his popularity was on an increase.

He was uni-directionally paranoid the direction being that of his wife from where apart from the routine curses one day came a rotating a screwdriver that just missed Raman’s eyes! Yet he loved her very much coz except few hours in the day she too loved him.
His position in Al Toro became odd when he bought a Volkswagen- a machine that only earned envy for Raman. They say that you can’t but fall prey to the arrows of envy. And Raman was no exception. He decided to quit Al Toro, and establish himself as a full-time painter – a decision not in conformity with his wife’s opinion.

Being a full time painter of weirdness he would force himself to imagine insanities. He begins to avert truth and the general perception of the things. He would rotate his head and try to see the inverted objects only to confuse his mind as to what the reality is. He would try to imagine ordinary objects (like his Parker pen) as an exotic piece of excellence. He would find flaws in everything he saw, and wish if they could be as per his imagination. Surprises, he began to believe, is the most important thing that can keep you away from this general monotony of life. “Surprises”, he said, “is more powerful than happiness ... it keeps you alive !”. His public behaviour has come (declined) a long way - from humour to unwanted humour to objectionable humour to darkness and pity - a behaviour that created a mix of irritation and sympathy in those who confronted him.

One day he dreamt God speaking to him. He painted it being careless about the result. “Is God weird ?”, was a question to be answered. “What Mr Raman want to say through his popular non-sense is that God is weird !”. What Raman painted was a never-before imagination. This made many sectarians ask, “Is this a Hindu God or Allah or Jesus or Buddha or... ”. The point was if it was Allah then it was the sole responsibility of that community to object, and likewise for others.
The defence from Raman was, “God is not weird! It’s his talking to me that is weird. As in many of my paintings, it’s not the absolute objects that are weird, rather it’s their actions are weird...”
But the property of the mob is – it doesn’t listen to arguments if it has once made its mind (if at all that exists anywhere)! The carnival of absurdities (his Hall) was reduced to carnival of ashes (by fundamentalists) as the last amber grew cold. The outcome – it was proved that God is not weird! He protects himself through these agents who would commit all sins, but not hear anything against something in front of which they rotate incense stick in the morning.

Raman did not go out for many days. He kept imagining and drawing on his note-book and oscillating brushes on the canvasses. His deliberate jumping into imagination became his habit, and soon his very character. It became hard for him to distinguish between a real event and a non-real. He would meet many distant people without going out at all! This was different from schizophrenia where you have a finite number of illusions playing around you. It appeared some strange case of hyper-reality, where the brain could deliberately detach itself from even the most known things.

Today he decided to go out of his house and meet his friends at Al Toro and see the Raman Hall. Luckily he found the door of his house open for the first time since many days. He rushed out. Many men asked him to stop. They chased him. But he managed to escape. “God ! The world is getting madder day by day !”, he thought.

He changed his plan, and went to see his hall first. He asked a man nearby, “Sir, there used to be a Raman Hall here. Where is that?”. “Raman Hall? There was no such tower here. This had been a community centre since I saw it for the first time in 1981.” He had misunderstood the building he thought. He came out and inquired about the Hall, but all in vain. It getting dark, he returned to his house.

He entered his house, and surprisingly found that a thick layer of dust had taken the responsibility of protecting everything. He took something from the floor, and removed the dust from some parts. Newspaper. And it showed an edifice. Wait. “I have seen this place...Oh this is where I came out from in the morning. This is my house! ” . He removed dust further and saw himself going into the edifice with some policemen. He could not make out. He cleared all dust. The news read “Raman gets relief. Acquitted on ground of strange disorder. Taken to Protege Asylum.” The body of the news was hardly legible. He was tired. He cleaned a part of the sofa and lay there before he found a dust laden portrait, the garland of which were cocooned by spider webs, on the wall. He cleaned the portrait. It was of Lalitha’s, his wife’s.

Emotionally Spastic??  Vivek was walking to go to office when he saw a spastic person walking to catch bus for his work. Everyday he had been going same road to his job. On his way there was a small uneven area and that spastic person would fumble and Vivek if there would help him through the patch. That used to happen quite often, you know it was the same spot but the spastic person would fumble anyway, Vivek used to offer help but that person used to refuse.   Maya's husband is little hot-headed. He get angry over small things and there is a fight… Fighting over small issues is common for Maya now and she is quite frustrated about her
husband's behavior..
 
what's the difference, we all have our weaknesses, some physical some emotional…
 
In fact people feel so much pity or bad about handicap people that they are more than willing to help but I don't know why same people are screaming about person who are emotionally handicap.  Maya's husband has a genetic tendency and I don't know how much we can really change our basic nature.  
 
Is there a co-relation between these 2 stories ? Emotional weakness and physical one  are they on the same level ?

Maya can't change her husband's nature but can she give him a helping hand?
 
 
There is one famous guy, who said "Accept people as they are". I kind of liked it…. I would stop complaining why he is failing whether in a physical or mental quality, you will feel like helping and that will solve lot of problems    
 
That spastic person or angry husband,  both are not ABLE to change but can we make other choice .. one that makes us happier ….
Kunti's Ghanti
Before I start writing on this I would just like to tell everyone that am not making fun or abusing history its just seeing today's IT/Corporate world this idea struck to me.
Whatever I write in this blog its all imaginary :)

We all know how Karan was born?? OMG!! not Kyunki's but Mahabharata's Karan.Ill just give a brief recap courtesy: "Wikipedia"

Karna was born to his mother Kunti by his father the solar deity Surya. Karna was born, before his mother's marriage to prince Pandu. When Kunti was young, the sage Durvasa visited her father's palace. She served the sage with utmost care for an entire year. Pleased by her service and hospitality, the sage foresaw her future difficulty after marriage of not having a child through Pandu, and hence granted her a boon to overcome this difficulty. By this boon she could call upon any god of her choice, and beget a child. Out of curiosity, Kunti still being unmarried, decided to test the power of the boon. She invoked the mantra and called Surya. Bounded by the power of the mantra, Surya appeared before her and granted her a son, who was as radiant and robust as Surya himself. This baby was born with an armour ('Kavacha') and a pair of earrings ('Kundala') attached to him. Though Kunti retained her virginity, she was unwilling to face the world as an unwed mother. She placed the baby Karna in a basket and set him afloat on the holy river Ganga in the hope that he would be taken in by another family.


Now lets move to my View

Imagine people working in IT industry getting such boon or power.Oh life would become so easy or i should say mantr(a)i :) i.e if IT people have mantra called Kunti's Ghanti then it would be so cool...

Guy working in IT industry is so happy to say my office timings are 8 to 5 so I get evenings.Is it true??Yes very much for few months atleast.Then he has to be isolated "Main aur mera Manager types".His friends start shouting at him on not coming to any trips,function,get together etc.
His gf/wife is like tell me if you are going to come for dinner then only ill think of making something; but think of it is it possible to inform at 6:30 in the evening that ill be home by 8:00??? No its not.Server might crash at 7:45 usually when cab is ready to pick you or at 7:40 your manager might ping you "Hey did u get time to look into this"??? If this continues how would people have family life?? Forget about life family atleast ?? :P
The other day I saw a kid in my society may be 5-6 year old kid his grandpa like came and took him for a ride I was surprised seeing grandpa taking a kid on a drive n all usually we see kid holding grandpa's hand and going to nana-nani park or a walk,but then I came to know that he was his dad and not grandpa.Result of starting late family or loss of (grey) hair due to work n tension.

Let's see the following story

A 30 year guy get married and tells his wife see we will plan our honeymoon a month later so that I can impress my boss saying seeing the work I have postponed my honeymoon and will get 1 month leave.What a plan??? Cool !
After 3 days of marriage he goes to office and mails his manager for leave for a month.Week passes no reply,then he sends a meeting request to the manager for the same.Before manager could accept the meeting request manager calls this guy for some discussion.He tells seeing your dedication we are offering you onsite opportunity to london for 3 months initially I understand you have just got married but this also leads to your promotion so thought of having a word with you.Poor guy with a smile on his face and tears too goes back to his desk.
Then he goes home and tells this to his wife;wife under impression that she would also go to london becomes happy (which is not really going to happen).Husband with all guts tells his wife see we can plan our honeymoon soemtime later as this is a good opportunity and I am thinking of taking it .
Next day wife comes up with this Kunti's Ghanti and tells I have got this Kunti's Ghanti mantra which would help me till the time you are back :) It works the same way it worked for Kunti but this is more advanced with protection :)If i skip the protection part of that mantra there are high chances that I get pregnant; but am thinking of why not take Hrithik Roshan or Brad Pitt's name in this Mantra instead of you.
Listening to this husband faints!

Story 3:

Once a husband returns home after 3 days of work and hugs his wife and say's I think we should start a family.Wife say's oh u had time to discuss this I already applied Kunti's Ghanti a month back thinking you might not have time to even discuss this..dont worry have taken your name and waiting for the result :)

Saw how Kunti's Ghanti useful for early family planning?? :P
Gay rights pros and cons   we all have been listening about gay rights these days. Recently Delhi high court also agreed to make homosexual relationship as a legal act. Prior to this historic and a bit controversial decision homosexual activities were considered as criminal under section 377. But now a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman.
Some people consider it right saying that we should not discriminate people based on their sexual habits. If some one is homosexual that is his or her choice and we should respect it. If we give their relationship a recognition in society then it will decrease the chances of unsafe sex. That will help in reducing the cases of HIV positive. Adding to that homosexual culture has gained a lot of popularity and it is not possible to keep suppressing them.
At the same time some people consider it is wrong. They say it is not our culture. It belongs to western countries and it suits them only. Some feel that it violates their religion and they are ready to do anything to stop it from spreading. Some politicians also have jumped into that thinking it may be another hot issue for vote bank. But still i feel that though many people in our country have their opinion about this issue not too many really bother about it. Specially those who are straight. So I just hope it wouldn't entertain politicians much.As far as religious feelings are concerned i will say that all the rules of all the religions were made by human beings only.So we can change them according to the need of hour.
Now we have seen some people favour homosexuality while some oppose it. I kind a have mix opinion about it. Well if someone is not straight then I don't think he or she should be left out of the society it will only make things worse and yes at the end of the day its their life and they have right to decide which way they gonna live it. Straight or Gay (lesbian). I guess most of the youngster like me will be thinking the same way and they really don't mind homosexuality being legal.
But but but.............
There is something that can be really bothering. I guess first time I heard about this gay thing from some of my friend i was in 10th or 11th standard and my first reaction was how can it be possible. How can a boy love a boy or how can a girl fall with another girl. I thought he was kidding. Only after some time i figured out he was right. Well for most of us we heard about the homosexuality things a bit too late and by that time it was very difficult to think about loving same sex person. Because most of us never thought that other way round also could have been possible and by the time we came to know we were already fond of other sex. But the way it has gone and grown in India in last few years it is getting a bit dangerous. Still thinking why? well because next generation will be knowing these things from their childhood. We will find the cases of homosexuality increasing and its legalisation will make it even worse. Most of the people who are standing today for gay rights will not find it the same if their kids follow the unconventional sex(homosexuality) habits. Most of the celebrities and young people stood in favour of gays. But they will definitely not support some one of their family following the Idea.Well currently we see in some of the colleges management is very strict with boys and girls hanging around together.But what they gonna do about this whole gay(lesbian) thing?? forget about hanging around they will be in same hostel and may be sharing room as well.I guess parents too will be having nightmares.Stop the kid(boy) from going out with girls or boys. So we have tough time ahead with this gay stuff.Hope it goes fine...............
Is uncle "SAM"behind "TERRORISM"????  -  It is my debut in blogs and i was thinking to do it long time ago but cannot.Now I have started it ,then I thought on what thing should I start. To tell u when I was thinking about this,in front of me the times of india home page was open and some clip of respected Manmohan Singhji and Mr. Ahmad Raja Gilani was open in which they were talking to each other in NAM summit.straightaway I thought that I will write on most important and dreadful and horrifying problem we are facing (I guess more than Global Warming) and that is TERRORISM.

It has been blamed that Pakistan or other countries in central Asia have initiated Terrorism but is that true ???I do not think so...These countries are all the scapegoats..then who is the master???yes absolutely correct ..it is uncle SAM.I am just not not crapping here ,I am telling u the truth.Pakistani author Ahmad Rashid in his book states that in 1986 when Soviet Union was in war with western countries especially U.S. then the inititation of organised militancy was done.

In this book it has been stated that in 1986 U.S.'s Central Intelligence Agency(CIA), Britain's M16 and Pakistan's InterServices Agency(ISI) planned to launch mujahideen attacks in Soviet Union and most of the funding was sponsored by uncle SAM.Now the question is that why are they afraid of aftermaths of the things they have done ???you have to be brave enough to face the things you have done .Now the twin tower attacks triggered their adrenaline and they started attacking here and there creating more terrorists then stopping them.There had been excessive killing in these in 8 years andits not acceptable and its just not only about stopping terrorism.its also about playing the oil game and winning it too.really hats off to uncle SAM and I am also still suspicious that was twin tower attack really act of Terrorism or it was game played by the clever mind of uncle SAM.You never know because when they create moon on earth then it can also be done.

These things have to be thought about and or the solutions have to be sorted out otherwise towers were in their own country then it can happen to any other.I am not blaming only one country but we should be ready for stopping it....
the pune visit It has been really killing me. 6 months long semester is like marathon race and if you were taking mid sem exams on Saturdays and were kept on your toes on Sundays as well then you can understand what I went through. It wouldn’t be wrong if you say I was workaholic in last 7 months. So I decided to take 8 to 10 days break. And I decided to go for pune as I have always liked this place. So let’s see what happened there.
I got ticket for a direct train from trichy to pune and I decided to board in that train in spite of the fact that I would reach there sharp 2 a.m. because that was the only train that has seats available. When it reached some place called Sholapur in Karnataka or Maharashtra people started closing and bolting the doors and windows. I asked what the matter was. Someone told me that some people may come to rob the train with swords and guns. He also told that last time he traveled through this train and robbers came and robbed the train. (What the hell. That is why I got the tickets for this train. There were 4 or 5 constables also in the train with guns to protect us). But I think it was my luck so nothing happened. I spent most of my journey reading my novel or watching out of the window. (No hot chicks to check out :().
I was praying my train to be late as I was going to my sister’s home in pune and she and my jiju were to come after 12 in the noon. But they left keys for me with their neighbors. But I couldn’t have gone someone’s home at 3 a.m. in the morning to ask for the key. My train reached on time. So I thought I should rather wait on station. There is one nice restaurant on station (I don’t remember the name as usual). It is 24*7 restaurant and its kind a place where you would love to go and have something. I have never seen such restaurant on any other station. I went there to have something and pass my time. Suddenly when I was on counter I got a call from my friend. He is studying in Lonavala. Dude 2 a.m. in the morning and he is calling he must be here somewhere I thought. I picked and he was seating behind me. We had a long chat, some food and coffee. I was meeting him after 3.5 years. I guess the World is really small. He had his train at 4:30. So we chatted for 2.5 hrs. I left at 6 a.m. and reached home around 7 after struggling with auto walas.
One day I spent sleeping and rest 3 were spend in seeing the beauty of pune. Now you must be wondering what is so beautiful in pune. Yup there are no tourist spots like in some other places. But city is full of youths and things that attract youths :). I played a lot with piyush (my nephew). Last time I saw him he was not even 1 year old. This summer he will turn 3. Kids and food are hard to resist. My taste buds were happy after long time. So I played a lot with him and also ate a lot. We sindhi are known for our passion for food and clothes. I haven’t seen anyone else spending as much money on food and clothes as we do. And our food can’t be finished without dessert. So I was loaded with a lot of stuff. I also went to my cousin. He is currently working in CRL (part of tata group)in pune. That is a lab where World’s 4th and Asia’s no. 1 supercomputer is kept. He told me a lot about his work and supercomputer. Though I couldn’t go to his lab as visitors were allowed on Saturdays only and I was heading for kalyan(1 hr form Bombay) before that. We went for movie (avatar) one evening. We thought as it is a week day we will get tickets. But we couldn’t get for evening as well as night show. We went for next day morning show (8:30 a.m.). Well pune girls were quite fashionable and I didn’t miss any opportunity to check them out. 2 years back when I went to pune their shorts used to be below knees but in these 2 years they have come above knees. I don’t know where they will be in next few years (lol :D :) ). Pune was chilly in morning and nights. But still when we went for the morning 8:30 show girls came wearing shorts and sleeveless. I realized that its quite tough to be a girl in a city like pune :D. These girls were no less than fire in a chilly morning. Anyways we went for the movie. I read a review of the movie somewhere before watching it and it said “you have never seen anything like this before” and yup these words were quite true. I saw it in 3D and found it to be really awesome.
After spending 4 or 5 days I left for kalyan and spent couple of days there. I booked the window seat in the train so i could enjoy the beauty of Lonavala and Khandala. Both the places are beautiful but if you want to see its true colors you should go in rainy season. I also had plan for Bombay but couldn’t go. In kalyan again most of my time went in talking to my cousin and wandering in shops and streets. I and my cousin discussed a lot about our college lives and all the funny stuff. Couple of years ago we two were youngest in our family until some offspring came and snatched our title :(. Anyways we are still the rock star of our family I guess :). So we had good time.
All good things come to an end. So was this trip. :(. But I had good time there and put on some wait too. :(. I hope mess food will bring me back to normal size.
Haven't posted here for months. All sorts of reasons and, simultaneously, no reason at all. It happens or it doesn't. Many's the time I've started writing a post and it's never come to fruition. That's just the way it goes.

There've been all sorts of lovely and important cultural events since I last posted. Maybe I'll get round to talking about them, maybe I won't.

I'm not long back, this evening, from a standard (I'm thinking of it as equivalent to Classic Coke) Duckie in terms of both Readers Wifes being present and correct. Amazing music, played in just the right order, some of it having gradually accreted danceable fabulousness over time (MGMT's Kids) and a good dollop of old favourite loveliness.

Amy commented on there being a "Back To School" vibe and, although my own work is constant through spring, summer, autumn and winter, I can see where she's coming from.
Buddha, one day, was on deep thought about the worldly activities and theways of instilling goodness in human.The following is the text of conversation between him and his disciple  One of his disciples approached him and said humbly " Oh my teacher ! While you are so much concerned about the world and others, why don't you look into the welfare and needs of your own disciples also."
Buddha : "OK.. Tell me how I can help you?"
Disciple : "Master! My attire is worn out and is beyond the decency to wearthe same. Can I get a new one, please."
Buddha found the robe indeed was in a bad condition which needed replacement. He asked the store keeper to give the disciple a new robe towear on. The disciple thanked Buddha and retired to his room.
Though he met his disciple's requirement, Buddha was not all that contended on hisdecision. He realized he missed out some point. A while after, he realized what he should have asked the disciple.

He went to his disciple's place and asked him "Is your new attirecomfortable? Do you need anything more ?"
Disciple : "Thank you my Master. The attire is indeed very comfortable. I need nothing more"
Buddha : "Having got the new one, what did you do with your old attire?"
Disciple : "I am using it as my bed spread"
Buddha "Then.. hope you have disposed off your old bed spread"
Disciple " No.. no.. master. I am using my old bedspread as my window curtain"
Buddha " What about your old Curtain?"
Disciple "Being used to handle hot utensils in the kitchen"
Buddha : "Oh.. I see.. Can you tell me what did they do with the old cloth they used in Kitchen"
Disciple : "They are being used to wash the floor."
Buddha "Then, what about the old rug being used to wash the floor...???"
Disciple "Master, since they were torn off so much, we could not find any better use, but to use as a twig in the oil lamp, which is right now lit inyour study room...."

BUDDHA SMILED IN CONTENTMENT AND LEFT FOR HIS ROOM.

We all are blessed to have a living example in our life in physical form.

Seems my sRGB conversion was causing that fireflies from previous images.

Btw. I was wondering why the farthest I've ever get in ray tracing (excluding fixed path MLT in C++) was when I was using OCaml. Say what You want, but that functional language thing fitted ray tracing very well. Also, but that's maybe caused by my nature - now when I have dozens of ways to implement something I start to wonder what way to choose, what would lead to better design. Too many options confuse me, and slow me down big time.

In both of the shows, the main character is portrayed as an ordinary person who is so much passionate about playing football.They at the beginning do not have that much skill in playing football but the unending passion which they have in their hearts make them play with so much talent that people think it its an inborn talent in them. I too am a normal person. Well, a little big for my age, not having that much stamina or any sorta skill in football. So its no great thing that I was but a defender when we played for fun at school. Seeing those 2 shows, for some reason, made me grow really passionate about that gr8 game. It made me think that I too want to be a player, have fun on the field, hit goals and what not! How I want to play in the International Field with the players like Ballack,Ronaldo,Ronaldinho,Robben and so many others.Well If not with them at least against them :) How I wish I could score against great goalies like lehmann and Buffon.
EU Commissioner alive on video  Do you, like me, sometimes feel that the EU is a faceless colossus with innumerable bureaucrats that you have no idea what they are up to?  Well, some commissioners have now understood the power of online video. Just check out this weekly video from the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding.  “I want all Europeans to be able to switch their phone operator â€“ whether mobile or fixed â€“ within one single day” A worthy cause indeed!

Here you see a very human EU Commissioner and you feel her enthusiasm and drive for the issue she is presenting. The video is simple, but professionally done, she is reading well from a teleprompter.

What a difference compared to just reading her press release!
Why are not more leaders using online video like this?

So I think this way of communication is exemplary, but there are someÂ  things that can be improved:

The video player should have an indication on how long the video is. This is essential, I want to know if I have the time or not available.
The video player should have an embed-button, so that it is easy to embed the video in blogs and other web sites. This creates viral spreading.
The text of her speech is downloadable as a PDF with a link next to the video. It would have been better to be able to read the text beside the video. Ideally the text should be navigable so that you can click on it to make the video jump to that part, like New York Times is doing.
There should be an RSS feed so that I can subscribe to these videos in my RSS reader.
It would have been nice to enable some form of viewer interaction. For example, have a poll about the issue mentioned, or allow comments to the video.
What do you think? Please comment!

Update April 3: I just received an email from an assistant to Ms Reding, thanking me for my email where I praised her for using video like this. I had not expected any reply, except maybe a short standard email response. So I was surprised to see that the email contained this image of a scanned letter:
DELIVERABLES VS. DELIVERY 
Wireframes, flow diagrams, personas, card sorts, content strategy documents, etc. All of these things are important to design, and designers need some combination of them to synthesize their user research and communicate what they’re doing with the other members of the team.

But too often these deliverables are the last line of contact for designers. Too often these deliverables are what designers prepare and then hand off to implementors. Then they shuffle off to create more deliverables and the cycle is repeated.

In the end deliverables are merely artifacts of the design process. They are not the final design, they are not the artifact of experience. The end user never interacts with them…they interact with the product or service that is actually delivered.

That’s the difference: deliverables are divorced from delivery.

Thus, the task of a UX designer, in order to stay true to our calling, doesn’t stop at any deliverable. Even if our “job” is to create wireframes, we cannot be satisfied with passing off wireframes to other team members. If we are truly concerned with the experience of the people who use our product/service, we will infiltrate their world…we will demand to know the quality of their experience.

Many UX designers are judged on the quality of their deliverables. This is necessary to a point, we must make sure each step is faithfully executed. But to truly be a user experience designer, we must have a longer scope. We can’t stop at deliverables. We must extend through delivery.

Deliverables are diminishing in importance. Sketches, super important to early design synthesis, have fleeting value. They are valuable for a very short period of time. Design, implement, iterate, move on. Record the learning, but don’t judge the sketch, judge the resulting experience.

So, if you’re not involved in the day to day feedback loop of your user’s experience, make sure you get involved. Ask about your feedback channels: support emails, call-center requests, twitter mentions, all of it. Do regular surveys and user testing. Investigate. Demand data. If you don’t, you’re just creating deliverables and missing the forest for the trees.

Experience, in the end, cannot be captured in a deliverable.
My youngest brother does not have much of a memory for directions and maps. While this leads to some friendly jibes about his lack of that so-called "manly" trait of the compass in the head, so to speak, it led to me to think about this whole notion of "necessary skills". So when I can look up directions on Google maps from my mobile phone, or have an in-car GPS system give me directions turn by turn and even notify me of traffic conditions, is a sense of physical direction an important skill any more?  I look back and realize that technology trends tend to define what skills are "in" or "out". I have forgotten the art of memorizing phone numbers, because we know share contacts through bluetooth, text messages and missed calls. Come to think of it, I have also lost the unique Indian skill of being able to buy a black ticket at a crowded cinema when the box office tells you that the tickets are sold out. That's because I buy my tickets and choose my seats online now. A few years back, I was part of a technical interview panel for my company, grilling some poor people on the basics of C++ and Java. And since I do not enjoy making people squirm, I left with a very bad taste. I decided then that it made no sense to ask somebody the "difference between overloading and overriding". If I was asked a question like that at a job interview, I would pull out a laptop, connect to the internet and show the interviewer the answer that I pulled up from Google. I fail to see why Indian IT services firms still continue to test people for their ability to memorize Kernighan and Ritchie's memorable tome. Memorization is a skill that's most definitely "out". Information is freely available and searchable. So let's stop testing for information and start testing for knowledge.
A Billion IDIOTS!! - Before I went to see 3 Idiots , I had heard a thousand people chant about the brilliance of the movie. So , amidst all the hosannahs and eulogies that i heard chanted about the film , all the frenzied applause by everyone whenever the name of the movie was mentioned , I went to see the film at last. And did 3 Idiots live up to my expectations...??

As a movie... YES. A perfectly made , celluloid entertainer. Every performance was exceptional for its sheer energy and versatality. So , As a cinematic adventure , Hirani and Amir hold the story together perfectly.

But , 3 IDIOTS , for all its fine comic moments , is a very dangerous film. The movie legitamizes a scorn and hatred of education. It ridicules the best education institutions set in INDIA , sanctions wilful dumbing of our own. It shows our higher education system as an arena of bad teachers determined to ruin the student's lives , suicidally pressurizing students.

Amazingly , a film whose central message is "the education system sucks", " we earn nothing at our centers of excellence" , "dont study hard jusst do what pleases you" is being hailed as the best film ever made in INDAIN CINEMA. This huge popularity of the movie shows how eager we are to embrace mindlessness and how keen we are to see education and hard work as obstacles to enjoying a good life.

We keep chanting the mantra "the-system-sucks , who-cares-about-grades , the-rat-race-is-foolish.". Yes our education system needs reforms , things need to improve but in the pusuit of educational reforms , we cannot allow standards of excellence be lowered. The IIT's must be applauded for the world-class minds they've thrown up , they are institutions that are respected all over the world.

There was a scene in the film in which Rancho mocks the Laplace Transforms (the equation written on the blackcoard) as an example of rote learning. Yet, without Laplace Transforms , Hirani's computer would not boot up!! As an Engineering student, I have never come across a teacher like VIRUS nor have i ever felt the manic stress during the 3 years of my college life.

Let's get real about higher education , and not engage in an escapist fantasy and convince ourselves that education doesnot matter. For each of us, geniuses or not ... there are no short cuts.

So , THREE IDIOTS IS A GREAT MOVIE!! BUT THAT'S JUST IT ... IT'S NO MORE THAN A STORY.

There is a general belief that religion and spirituality are outside the scope of examination using scientific methods. I beg to disagree. Science comprises observation, theory and verification. All human experience is based on observation. In ordinary life, the result of observations, over a long period of time, is called experience. However science requires the observations to be objective, systematic, accurate making conscious effort to reduce errors by repeating the experiments and having it reviewed by peers. Similarly the difference scientific theory and others is that it constructs a theoretical model based on logic and mathematics. This model has to be consistent with the observed facts. The last stage is verification during which a prediction is made and a new experiment is done to verify whether this is correct. For instance theory of relativity predicted that light rays would bend when they pass very near the Sun. This was verified and found to be correct.
OM Shanti Shanti Shanti   You must have gone through some unpleasant, uncomfortable moments in life when you are not FEELING GOOD about things, about situation or about people. Whether its just about salt in food or somebody around you whom you don't want in the moment or you stuck in thick traffic or somebody behaving in a way which is disturbing you or sometime for no reason we don't feel good. The most often what we do we blame others and complain about things or people about the way we feel. And this happen to most of us and most of time without being even aware about it. So what is the way out?   Here is what you can observe. Whenever you are going through some unpleasant feeling. Just give a pause to yourself and obsever what is happening inside? How is the state of your mind? Is it cluttered, agitated, heated up or heavy. In principle this is what is reflecting out (if you not ready to accept this truth say it most of the time ). So when you become aware of this disturbed state mind, just remind your mind to be peaceful and calm right now. If its too difficult give a bigger pause and just tell yourself that you are commited to inner peace, you are peace :) and first become peaceful inside. You will see immediately things will be more clearer.

This I observe after reading Guruji's one knowledge sheet where He says, "Forget about knowledge, God, service any good thing in life, first comes the PEACE. If there is no peace nothing can happen." And to my experience this is so true and striking peace at first place make a tremendous difference. Its so amazing.

So next time you feel any unpleasant moods or moments: give yourself a pause and remind yourself about inner peace and chant inside Om Shanti Shanti Shanti! (Om Peace Peace Peace)

And Share your experiences.
All Glory to Gurudev
Greetings and Huzzah, pitiful earth dwellers!

Behold the beauty and awe put forth by this, my greatest triumph to date! This is the blog of the evil Grand Master Flash of the underworld! The one and only mechanical deity, TOBY, Robot Satan! Fall to your knees and promise your ever-loving soul to me!

Have you had ample time units to reach the human kneeling position?

Excellent! Fear my wrath, for from my forth floor walk-up one-bedroom perch in the doomed city of New York, I see and know all human wants, needs and eateries! Do not attempt to ignore my presence or resist my power of soul persuasion! You will surely lose, with your punishment for such insolence being the loss of all things smooth and cold!

You have now been oppressed! Through a blog!

Stop back often for evil updates and mighty pie recipes!

Yours in uncomfortably humid hellfire,

Mighty TOBY, Robot Satan
Now at this point we need to clarify the fact that three bowls containing the porridge were all made of difference materials, each with different thermal properties. This explains why when tasting Daddy bear's big bowl ofporridge discovered it was much too hot; mummy bear's medium sized bowl was freezing cold, and baby bear's small bowl was at an acceptable temperature. One can only assume that mummy bear's taste in cold porridge is not completely bonkers. Anyway, chavpig that she was, goldilocks ate up all of baby bear's porridge. This is described as a somewhat gluttenous act, even though we are initially told that baby bear's bowl is incredibly small. He's probably still being weaned off salmon. Like any good greedyguts, Goldilocks decided that she might as well sit down, and spotting the bear's three chairs decided to try them one by one. Now, Goldilocks is obviously a right fussy bitch, and daddy bear's chair was considered to be too hard, and mummy bear's chair was too soft and lumpy, like a bean bag or something. Can you imagine taking her to DFS for a new three piece suite? She'd be a bloody nightmare.
But these are not very comprehensive and have to be supplemented by rules each society consider necessary. These are the rules of morality and rules of law. Whereas the internal rules need no implementing agency, the external ones need agency to implement them. Early on the group leader was the authority for this purpose. During the course of time the village elders, village panchayts, the chieftain of a county, the king, the Emperor and the Government became the implementing authorities. Any one familiar with law enforcement will know that 99% of people have to be obedient to law under internal compulsion not under external threat of detection and punishment. This is usually achieved by indoctrination from childhood onwards during the course of education or otherwise. Here comes the role of religion. Every religion is a moral code. Observance of the moral code is essential for the faithful to attain whatever may be their spiritual objective. The very high percentage of faithful among humans is, I think, based on an internal programme built into our genes. No religion will stand the test of rationality. One needs a very high ability to suspend disbelief to be faithful. My theory there is an inbuilt gene, which ensures this for the majority of people. There are many other essential roles that religion plays. It relieves our fear of death and life after death, it gives hope for the hopeless, it makes it possible for one feel bliss due to religious fervor which like other human moods (happiness, sorrow, grief, pain, anger hatred, etc.) needs an outlet. It satisfies the need for performing rituals, which seem to have a psychological impact on humans. I am not aware of any society, which does not resort to rituals. 
Will it be used for digital video content, ie, TV ? Why would we want it to be used for TV ?

The internet has the opportunity to continue to be transformative. There are applications out there that can change the quality of our lives.  Im not talking about the ability to update your facebook, or check out what where everyone is at on 4Square and twitpic what is happening to your friends and followers. Social Media is one more amazing communication platform that is impacting our lives. But its not tranformative.

There will be transformative applications that need all the bandwidth they can get. Medical, Transportation, Defense, Gaming, Simulations and who knows what. As computers become more powerful, we need to be able to send more data to the cloud where they can crunch data and return it to us.

That is the value of an open internet. The things we cant imagine today. The applications that are just dreams because  they dont have enough horsepower and bandwidth to work today. I want the internet to be a platform for amazing. Not Gilligan’s Island reruns.

I recognize that with openness comes the risk of the least common denominator dominating.  Porn has just as much right to dominate the net as any other app. But should it ?

Yes it should. The lesson of TV over the internet vs TV over digital cable or satellite isnt about openness. Its about the value of Application Specific Networks. DIgital CAble is an application specific network. Its only job is to serve up content and it works very well.

The FCC needs to recognize this and start working with internet broadband providers to define tunnels,  Private Virtual Networks  or just plain reserved bandwidth that are saved for future applications. When a transformative application presents itself, there should be an opportunity to define the network to optimize that application.
The convention overall went really well. Every year it just seems to get bigger. I've been to a lot of gaming conventions in the Houston area and Owlcon remains the one to go to. A lot of those conventions come and go, but Owlcon has always remained rock steady. I can't wait until next year. This year was a bit special to top it off. Since I won the logo contest, I got to see my design on hundreds of gamers!! I can't really say I was wild about the purple but hey, it was my design on hundreds of gamers!! It was a very cool feeling. To make it all the more better, GURPS game I ran went really well and I even got to catch up with an old Army buddy I used to work and game with. Back when I still wore Army greens to work instead of pajamas, Matt and I used to hobble along company PT runs together at Fort Campbell. We went to AIT together and somehow managed to get the same duty station together for our first (and last) assignment. Both of us not being strong runners on our PT tests, we ended up doing mandatory PT.
Notes from Mussoorie - Day 1  -   It's a clear night full of stars in Mussoorie. The chilly breeze makes me shiver under my spine and somehow i am enjoying it till the core.

Looking down is Dehra valley lit up like a golden jewel. What an amazing tapestry! Amazing view captured by my retina.

The room that i have taken is a reminder of ancient British Era. It's a heritage hotel and well kept one. During morning the Sun wakes you up as you open the window.

Balbir Singh, my room attendent reminds me of British officers who had a personal attendant saying "Haaji Sir" on every possible statement of mine.

I am enjoying my stay! Thank you Mussoorie for being so kind.   After initial hiccups i reached Mussoorie today Morning, with completely no idea what is in store for me. This is the least planned trip for me.

It was 11 by the time i reached and then after getting refreshed i opt for some walking aroound the Mall Road just to get the feeling in.

I came back after an hour with the notebook and started to settle. Since there was no planned activity i was enjoying my state of doing nothing.

After finishing late lunch generally i got the feeling as to how would it be if at all i would be able to meet Mr. Ruskin Bond, after all he lives here only! What if i could just sneak into his home and have a small conversation! Embroiled in these thoughts only i ventured to move out in search for the book shop.

It took me only 15 mins to reach and i bought two books, "The room on the roof, Vagrants in the Valley", his very first book and "Notes from a small room", his latest. I asked casually whether he visit here sometime and much to my surprize the owner said that he will be coming here anytime soon!!! This was least expected.

Though i had updated my status in FB "Meeting with Mr. Bond", but i had never even imagined it would come true. There were very few people and all were waiting for him. After sometime he came in his chauffer driven car.

There was no Tamasha, no security guards, no protocols. He was walking and talking like any of us do. Such is his simplicity. I was completely taken aback. He signed on both of the books and i chatted for a while, shared a joke and more sitting just next to him!!!

I came back to my hotel room. After sometime i realised that one of my wish has just been fullfilled. It's been so kind of him to take his time out. I wish i could meet more people like him.

Mussoorie has really been kind to me. Thank you Mussoorie.

Written on 13th Feb just before finishing the wonderful day.
As a former schoolteacher, I know just how broken education is and how far away it is from hitting the mark of supporting the development and exploring personal potential for young people. One thing you can do for the next generation of young people is share what you know on the internet. If you lay down the breadcrumbs as you live and you share what you know, it will live on and help others stand on your shoulders and build past what you have done. There are lots of benefits to going to school, but it doesn't have a monopoly on knowledge or hold the only keys to a great job.

I see sharing as the future of business too. By sharing our designs with the MakeBot community, we've found a fantastic community of passionate people who are willing to tell us what we're doing right and support us in figuring out how to improve. The examples go on and on.

What are you sharing? What frontiers do you see for sharing. Are there things that you're not sharing that you could?
I spent a bad night. A night in pain due to spasms that kept hurting my spine and back the entire night. After trying out various different positions to ease the discomfort and failing, I sat up and screamed ’shut up’. And having done that, resumed my attempt at slumber. I had the soundest sleep for the following two hours before the alarm went off to wake me for the morning gym routine. This is unusual. Not the screaming, the alarm waking me up. Normally my apprehension of whether it shall work keeps me half awake till the designated hour. But it did not last night, or well, really, this morning. I sailed into the gymnasium with forced enthusiasm and despite the few odd muscle catches that occurred, by the end of my two hours there was a definite sense of improved condition. The bounce came back, the heat of the morning sun on the lawn was welcomed and the entire day has been spent in spasmless wonder !! I wore a new dress.
Sorry, Charlie

Until recently, it was assumed that Charlie Crist, Florida's gay Governor, would take an easy walk from Florida to the US Senate in next November's election. Until Charlie's support started to crumble around him, that is.

A Rasmussen poll from last week shows that Crist's primary opponent, Mark Rubio, brought the race to a dead heat: 43% to 43%. In an effort to court the conservative wing of the Florida GOP, Rubio is running hard to the right. A hard right wing Senate candidate would be a much harder sell to the people of Florida than a popular Governor who enjoys an approval rating of 68% of Democrats!

As if that is not enough, Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart (pictured), brothers who serve in Congress, have withdrawn their endorsement of Charlie and Rubio continues to press hard. Florida's GOP is conservative and Charlie pitted against Rubio could mean that the Governor could lose his primary election and be out of a job at the end of next year. Crist had to make a choice between running for Governor or US Senator. Perhaps it he picked the wrong one.

In the report, Lincoln Diaz-Balart explained that Crist had 'left us [the two brothers] no alternative and he knows why.'

Do tell Lincoln, do tell.

Huck goes pro-gay

Well, he's supporting a gay guy for public office. Of course, a few weeks after a guy you paroled slays four cops you'll do anything to change the narrative about yourself.

Andre Bauer gets Huckabee's backing:
Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer is being backed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee in the GOP race for governor.

Huckabee, who served as governor of Arkansas before finishing second in S.C. Republican presidential primary in 2008, endorsed Bauer in a fundraising letter for the lieutenant governor and Huck-PAC, Huckabee's political action committee.

'Andre Bauer is a champion we can believe in,' Huckabee wrote. 'He has fought for the people of South Carolina since the day he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996. As Lt. Governor, he has ruled against every single proposed tax increase, saving the people of South Carolina $2 billion.'"
However, there was something highly unfortunate about these missions: they were waaay before my time! I wasn't around to see it! I did get to see the launch of something equally interesting though: the New Horizons probe. This wonderful probe launched on January 19th, 2006. I watched the live feed from NASA's website (after watching the failed launch on the 11th). It's main mission is to study the outer solar system and Pluto, but New Horizons will give us more pictures of Jupiter and the Jovian moons than Pluto. By pictures, I mean the works- not just that puny band of the spectrum which we call "visible light"- particle readings, radio waves, light, orbital charts of the moons, you name it. New Horizons will then go on to study Pluto and its moon, Charon. Pluto, which recently got demoted (arguably a wise move) from planet status. After this, New Horizons will go on to study the Kuiper belt, a large belt of asteroids and "plutoids", or near-Pluto size objects. It will leave the solar system in 2029 (estimated). However, perhaps fittingly, New Horizons will never catch up to the Voyager probes.
Relations - There are two types of relations. One is Blood made relation, and another is Time made relation.
Blood made relations are like father, mother, sister, brother, cousin, grand parents and all(family members). This type of relation is constant one(no change in love, love forever), you love your father means, you love him from the day you were born till the day of your separation(death).
Time made relation are those which are dependent on time, like friendship. As time pass by, the relations becomes stronger or weaker, according to the separation (distance between the two friends ). But there are some relations which grow stronger, even if the distance between the two is high.
So it is necessary for the relation, whose strength(love for the person) goes on increasing regardless of the separation, just to end increasing the strength. One wants to shift that relation in constant one, to the loved one, blood made relation, letting the person to become a part of your family. So the question is, why to choose only husband and wife, why can't it be brother and sister or brother in law and sister in law. Don't you love your sister, don't you want to see her happy. Love is all about to wish to see the person you love, happy.
And the answer is, strength of that relation(love for the person) is so much increased that you don't just want to see her happy, you'll do anything to see her happy, you want to be with her always. And among the given relations, in family only husband and wife stays with each other.
As, this kind of relation was time made relation, I don't believe in love at first sight. [:D]
Well now a days, we should think for brother-brother relations also :P
Last week, the same 7-8 of us who used to meet daily in shcool days, had to send a thread consisting of 300 mails just to decide when and where we all shall meet together, after a gap of aroud about 4 months. This week, my friend and colleague Rajeswari spent endless hours communicating and organising over two days, just to decide where, when and HOW she and 4 of her friends(Sathya, Swetha, Priya and Swathi, who used to meet daily in college and even in weekends), can meet this weekend. See the HOW, that is a new clause added, first it was anytime anywehere, then it was anywhere but in a particular time coz someone has n’t returned from college and so on, then it was at a particular time, at a particular place coz people come from far away on a weekend, so they dont have enough time to come to all the friends place etc. Now it is how! ya How! everyone is available, but all are busy, “how can we meet? hey I have work, next week our project release, I have a client call next week, so i ll be home at only 9:00 pm and i have work on Sunday too”, so more often , people silently come home, sleep for a day , take rest and go back.
All in all, the impression I got was of an incredible wealth of software, written and maintained by dedicated volunteers all over the scientific community.

During the Q&A session, we touched upon the usual topics, like Python 3 transition, the GIL (there was considerable interest in Antoine Pitrou's newgil work, which unfortunately I could not summarize adequately because I haven't studied it enough yet), Unladen Swallow, and the situation with distutils, setuptools and the future 'distribute' package (for which I unfortunately had to defer to the distutil-sig).

The folks maintaining NumPy have thought about Python 3 a lot, but haven't started planning the work. Like many other projects faced with the Python 3 porting task, they don't have enough people who actually know the code base well enough do embark upon such a project. They do have a plan for arriving at PEP 3118 compliance within the next 6 months.

Since NumPy is at the root of the dependency graph for much of the software packages presented here, getting NumPy ported to Python 3 is pretty important. We briefly discussed a possible way to obtain NumPy support for Python 3 sooner and with less effort: a smaller "core" of NumPy could be ported first, which would give the NumPy maintainers a manageable task, combined with the goal of selecting a smaller "core" which would give them the opportunity for a clean-up at the same time. (I presume this would mostly be a selection of subpackage to be ported, not an API-by-API cleanup of APIs; the latter would be a bad thing to do simultaneous with a big port.)
Change!!!
Its been almost five months since i graduated and started work and here i am now, at a standstill...Life seems to be in a pause phase at the moment. 
Its strange how you change from a teenager to a grown up in such a short period of time, all cos of a simple fact that now i am on my own..lol..sounds strange doesnt it...It was much clear back then as to what, where, how etc,...but now life seems slower than it ever was. 

Theres this strong urge in me to be someone, to do something and show the world but then again, the fear and the insecurity within makes me feel even more vulnerable and weak. 

Sometimes i find myself over excited and filled with positive energy and optimism and other times i am like, comparing myself to the better ones and saying wow, am i even getting there...i guess the more i compare, the more i pull myself down, well thats when i am jealous..but otherwise it kinda motivates me to do even better.
Sometimes i feel great about myself but many a times, especially when i am with others, i find myself comparing myself with them for every little things...i guess its gotta do with the insecurities that has build up within me over a period of time..may be the past..lol...Anyways i gotta work on it...after all, its the change within that can change the exterior circumstances isn't it...Anyways as for now, i have to do my laundry and i hate it..

Meanwhile you take care and happy surfing!!!!
Artificial Flight and Other Myths (a reasoned examination of A.F. by top birds)

Artificial Flight and Other Myths
a reasoned examination of A.F. by top birds
Over the past sixty years, our most impressive developments have undoubtedly been within the industry of automation, and many of our fellow birds believe the next inevitable step will involve significant advancements in the field of Artificial Flight.  While residing currently in the realm of science fiction, true powered, artificial flying mechanisms may be a reality within fifty years.  Or so the futurists would have us believe.  Despite the current media buzz surrounding the prospect of A.F., a critical examination of even the most basic facts can dismiss the notion of true artificial flight as not much more than fantasy.

We can start with a loose definition of flight.  While no two bird scientists or philosophers can agree on the specifics, there is still a common, intuitive understanding of what true flight is: powered, feathered locomotion through the air through the use of flapping wings.  While other flight-like phenomena exist in nature (via bats and insects), no bird with even a reasonable education would consider these creatures true fliers, as they lack one or more key elements.  And, while some birds are unfortunately born handicapped (penguins, ostriches, etc.), they still possess the (albeit undeveloped) gene for flight, and it is indeed flight that defines the modern bird.

This is flight in the natural world, the product of millions of years of evolution, and not a phenomenon easily replicated.  Current A.F. is limited to unpowered gliding; a technical marvel, but nowhere near the sophistication of a bird.  Gliding simplifies our lives, and no bird (including myself) would discourage advancing this field, but it is a far cry from synthesizing the millions of cells within the wing alone to achieve Strong A.F. Strong A.F., as it is defined by researchers, is any artificial flier that is capable of passing the Tern Test (developed by A.F. pioneer Alan Tern), which involves convincing an average bird that the artificial flier is in fact a flying bird.

Now we know the goal, but what about the technical hurdles?  Our visions of the bird wing are becoming more accurate, it’s true, and soon we may have a full model of every muscle, bone and sinew, but even this is merely information.  There’s never been a realistic timetable of how long it would take to replicate even a portion of the wing, whether through biology, engineering or otherwise.  And even the most optimistic birds have yet to explain how we plan to accurately rebuild the delicate array of feathers that are essential to flight.  Do not misinterpret this pessimism as cynicism, mind you, as I do believe these studies are worthwhile, as we will learn more about ourselves and what it means to be a bird.  Replicating birddom, though, is almost definitely out of our reach.

Even if we were capable of completely achieving the above, how would we ever know if it was a true bird?  Where does flight really reside?  We may build a functioning, flapping wing, but what if the essence of flight is deeper, hidden within the cells or elsewhere?  We would only succeed in making a hollow doll that only gives the appearance of flight. If this is the end result, is it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources?

There are religious birds who believe God made Bird in His own image, and while I do not share in most of these beliefs, I do think there’s something to be said about the motivation behind creating Strong A.F.  Perhaps, as we are the only creatures on Earth capable of flight, we want to push forward past our current capabilities, perhaps even augmenting our own flying capacities if independent A.F. is an impossibility.  This could be interpreted as noble, but I would argue that there’s very little utility in replicating what nature has essentially perfected.  Why spend millions on an artificial flier when there are so many birds out of work?  Many weaker fliers have already lost their jobs to gliders; is it wise to rush to make ourselves obsolete?  A.F. research may unlock some hidden mystery about ourselves, and it may make the lives of some more comfortable, but at best, true Strong A.F. is a pipe dream and at worst a challenge to what it means to be a bird.
Playing with Xcode and AppleScript

In case you noticed a post about PDFopener and were curious, I've been playing with Xcode, the Mac OS X development environment. And AppleScript. I guess either could be useful if I ever build a robot with a Mac brain. I wonder how hard it would be to use Xcode to develop for ATmega MCUs. At any rate, the reason for the PDFopener project was that I got sick of problems downloading USPS shipping labels so I dove in and fixed it.


set text item delimiters to ".LabelGenerationServlet"
set stripOther to first text item of fileName
if stripOther is not equal to fileName then

AppleScript is somewhat bizarre to me, an outgrowth of HyperCard's HyperTalk language (anyone remember that?), sort of a pseudo-English programming language. It's a bit mind-boggling for a dude used to C and Perl. I didn't spend any time really learning the language fundamentals but was able to slog my way to making a functional program, chipping away at it little by little with a lot of searching on macscripter.net. Trying to do too much at once and it would all fall apart. Like building a house of cards. That's not unlike my robotic coding experiences thus far, actually.

Unicorn-1 Arm

Time to arm the robots! No, not for world takeover. I'm talking about robotic arms. Digging through the stack of old robot stuff I ran across a photocopy of this ancient, August, 1980 series from Radio-Electronics.

The first article offers a neat, simple design for a robotic arm that seems relatively easy to build with some basic tools and careful techniques. Interesting excerpts are reproduced here for educational purposes.
The elbow-forearm actuator is comprised of a large motor and threaded rod that pulls a on the midpoint of the forearm. The shoulder is actuated, I think, from a motor within the robot. Details on the design, dimensions, etc, are given below.
To save weight, I suppose one could change the design to use aluminum tube instead of steel rod for the side rods. They're available from home improvement stores, hardware stores, and online shops.

Some parts (right) need to be machined, unless one comes up with a simpler way to fabricate them. If so, I think all that's really needed is a drill press, a way to ensure drilling a hole through the center of a rod, a cutoff saw, some hand tools, and a tap or two.

An electronics article from the 80's would be good for a chuckle. But since motor and mechanical technology haven't changed all that much, I submit that these 30 year old plans are still relevant for the modern robot builder.
Umami Nation: Kombu Dashi Smackdown
January 19th, 2010 · Uncategorized

posted by Dave Arnold

Kombu, a variety of giant kelp (seaweed), is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking. Kombu is particularly high in free glutamic acid—the umami maker—but its flavor is otherwise rather delicate, so it is an excellent source of MSG.  By the way, glutamic acid + sodium = MSG. (You’ll get much more on MSG and umami in our upcoming post: Umami Nation: MSG the Superspice—the Headache is in Your Head.)  This post is about kombu broth.

Several types of Kombu are used in Japanese cooking.  For a discussion of kombu, I refer you to this website or this book.  We used ma kombu which was harvested—as many good things are—in the cold waters off Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island. Yuji Haraguchi of True World Foods, a premier supplier of fish and Japanese products (we buy our fish for ike-jime from them), brought us the kombu.


Ma kombu. High quality stuff from Hokkaido. Brought to us by True World Foods.
Most traditional books will instruct you to place a piece of kombu in cold water and then heat that water until it just begins to bubble, upon which you immediately remove the kombu. But recent work in Japan has shown that optimal glutamate extraction is actually obtained by steeping kombu in 65° C water for about an hour. Several years ago, when we first heard about temperature regulating kombu stocks, we told a group of Kaseiki chefs that they might want to use an immersion circulator. They looked at us like we had three heads (in fact we had only two). Undaunted, we vowed to thoroughly test kombu stocks in the circulator. Two and a half years later, we finally got around to it.


Setting up the tasting.
Setting Up the Test
The tests: we would make one broth traditionally, and one like the Kaiseki do—by attempting to regulate water temperature to 65° C on a typical stove.  After carefully reading the dashi sections of some our favorite books, we settled on 10 grams of kombu per liter of liquid—though intuitively this seemed low to us. For a third test we would circulate the kombu in water at 65° C.

We could think of two possible reasons the circulated broth wouldn’t be as good (or better) than other techniques: 1) if the air churned in by circulation had a negative effect, or 2) if the crappy heat control of the stovetop was actually a benefit; i.e., if temperature fluctuation somehow made the stock better. To control for the air problem we added a test of some kombu circulated in a vacuum bag. It didn’t take long for Nils and I to realize the bag was probably a good idea anyway, because we would get some vacuum-infusion benefits.

Yuji from True World also suggested we try some cold infusion, so we added a 10 gram/liter overnight infusion to our test, a 10 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion, and a 20 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion. We never heated these infusions with the kombu in them. As a final test, Yuji suggested we heat the regular overnight infusion in the traditional way (until bubbles start to form), with the kombu in it. We ended up with 8 different kombu broths, and we tasted them blind.

What We Didn’t Test

We didn’t test a temperature range. We didn’t do 60° versus 65° versus 70° C. Next test.
We didn’t test the level of free glutamate in the broth. Most literature will tell you this number is important. But we can’t measure free glutamate here, and we thought it much more important to judge the broths on taste alone.
We didn’t test the interaction of the kombu broths with other umami-producing ingredients like bonito flakes (katsuobushi) or shitake mushrooms. Bonito flakes have inosinic acid, and shitakes have guanylate, both of which act synergistically with the glutamic acid in kombu to create a lot more umami than kombu alone.
Often a kombu is re-used to make a secondary dashi after the primary broth is made. Some of the extraction methods we used rendered the leftover kombu virtually tasteless, which would make a secondary dashi impossible.  So we didn’t test secondary dashis.
The Results


Kombu Tasting Results. We tested three different groups (red, blue, and green), and then pitted the winners of each group against each other to figure out which kombu dashi reigned supreme. The red block tested methods of making kombu dashi at 65° C: directly in a circulator, in a vacuum bag in a circulator, and by trying to maintain 65° C on a stovetop. The blue block tested cold infusion techniques: in a vacuum bag at 20 grams kombu per liter, in a vacuum bag at 10 grams kombu per liter (traditional amount), and 10 grams of kombu in a liter of water without a bag. The green group pitted traditional kombu dashi--10 grams per liter started cold and just brought to the bubble and strained, versus cold infused then heated dashi also at 10g/liter without a vacuum bag.
Vacuum bagged 65° C circulated kombu stock reigned supreme!

The verdict was decisive. Unanimous and unequivocal.

In the future, we will test vacuum bagged 65° C kombu at 15 g/liter and at 20 g/liter, because 20g/liter won the cold infusion category.  We should also try cold-vacuum-infused-then-heated broth.  We think it would win.
In the event some form of ubiquitous entertainment comes first ,  takes over the net and saturates it, how is the FCC going to solve the bandwidth traffic jam ? They wont ever be able to put the bandwidth genie back in the bottle. Screaming at broadband providers to spend the money wont work any better than screaming to expand highways helps to alleviate rush hour traffic

The FCC wants Internet 2 at universities to flourish and develop new things. But where are they going to roll them out to if all of our bandwidth to the home is being used for some new form of 3D virtual fantasy sports?

I just dont think these things will just manage to take care of themselves.  The reality is that when we run into future internet application roadblocks our politicians will jump in the mix and attempt to “solve” the problems. You know where that will get us.

We need to start the process now of putting some bandwidth to the home away for a rainy day. Not only do we need to preserve bandwidth in the last mile, but the FCC also needs to  figure out a way to create a transparent market or exchange that allows competing applications a means of knowing how and when they will have access to bandwidth when, not if,  it becomes constrained.

And if you really want to make things interesting, the company that is doing the most work on realtime markets and competing for resources that i know of ? ….. Google.

Deal with it today or struggle with it in the future.
Power of Sattva...Unleashed in Mumbai   23 to 26 Dec 2009 witnessed 490 people experiencing the Part 2 course in the famous Yogi Sabhagraha Swaminarayan Hall in Dadar. Sattva personified Rishi Vidhyadharji mesmerised all of us with his Satsang Aerobics Yoga at midnight (6 am for me is midnight...he he), his brilliant Sadhana sequence and his Q&A sessions in the satsangs early morning (if you have slept from 4 to 6 pm then 8 pm feels like early morning).

Rishiji would conduct the course from 6 am to 9.30 pm. Inspite of such a busy schedule he offered 2 hour knowledge sessions on 2 days from 6 to 8 pm to YES!+ volunteers.

Some snippets: (NOT verbatim...just jotting the essence from what I remember)

This should be your goal: Becoming 'MUKT' (free) from the 5 deepest, strongest and oldest impressions: Food, Sleep, Sex, Fear and Laziness. He added that once you have become free from these impressions then you will know what your real purpose in life is. The humour and liveliness with which he explained this was exemplary.


Q: How to avoid being conscious when amongst people?
A: Rather than bothering about looking good, focus on feeling good. In looking good you lose your naturalness and peace. When you feel good then you will NOT become a football of others opinions and will be more effective.


Q: Should we be perfectionists?
A: Rather than looking for perfection, be with that which is perfect


Q: How to handle competition as it involves comparison with others?
A: Competition is sugar coated greed and jealousy. A person who is caught in competition is a victim of greed and jealousy. He tries to do several things 100% and gets stressed. Its important to BE (not necessarily DO) 100% in whatever you do.


Q: I am confused about marriage. How to decide whether to marry or not?
If one or more of the following five are of concern (needs) for a girl, then she should marry: Security, Companionship, Sex, Progeny and learning surrender
If one or more of the following four are of concern (needs) for a boy, then he should marry: Companionship, Sex, Progeny and learning surrender

Q: While on my way to meet Guruji, the excitement I feel, is it feverishness or longing?
A: While on your way if you are relaxed then its longing, else its feverishness. And on meeting him, if Guruji doesn't look at you and you don't mind it as you are happy that YOU saw HIM, then it was longing and if you feel upset or disappointed that HE didn't look at YOU, then it was feverishness.

Is Yemen A Safe Place To Visit-- Or Live?


The drive from Sanga in Mali's Dogan country to Timbuktu is not for the faint of heart-- and not even possible without a solid 4 wheel drive, off road vehicle. When we did it a couple years ago, we got lost in trackless wastes-- with an experienced guide-- and broke down several times. But half way between driving over boulders in Dogan and the rutted track through the Sahara there's a stretch of paved road around a town called Douentza. There's not much to the town at all, but there's a roadside cafe where truckers and travelers can stop for a plate of slop and a cold drink and a chance to stretch and possibly realign one's spine. Ahhh... good old Douentza. I decided to fast but Roland had some kind of spaghetti lunch that took an hour or so to prepare. While waiting we met a Spanish architect, his wife and two daughters going in the other direction. We swapped road tips. And, as travelers do, we also swapped travel stories. They'd been traveling the world's forgotten places as long as I had. I told them about Afghanistan and Ceylon. They told us about Ethiopia and Yemen.

Yemen, in fact, was their greatest adventure. It was before the daughters had been born and the two Spanish students had been kidnapped by Yemenite bandits. It was strictly a business affair, no brutality or violence or anything like that. They were treated as guests and a month or so after being detained the ransom was paid and they were released... with the story of a lifetime. 

Saturday night, for no particular reason, I tweeted a NY Times story by Robert Worth on how the Yemeni addiction to qat (khat)-- a very thirsty plant that is mildly narcotic-- is making the barely habitable country completely uninhabitable due to the depletion of the aquifers. It's a story of desolation and ruin... and danger. It still isn't a safe place for tourists to visit. On the other hand, it isn't a safe place for anyone, including the Yemenis.

The first time I ever really thought much about Yemenis was when I was general manager of Sire Records. Legendary music man, Seymour Stein, had signed an Israeli-Yemenite single, Ofra Haza (one of her songs is below) and told me how big she was in Europe, how much he loved her and hated her manager and asked me to try to break her in the U.S. We put out several albums and singles by Ofra and she had some success but, while she may have been "the Madonna for the Middle East," her music was more popular in gay dance clubs than on Top 40 radio. I always thought it odd, though, that when I visited Arab countries-- especially Morocco and Egypt-- people were wildly enthusiastic about her. No one minded that she was Israeli, let alone Jewish.

With album titles like Yemenite Songs, Yemenite Love, and Desert Love and with songs "Im Nin' Alu," "Galbi", and "Daw Da Hiya" it would be hard for all but the most casual of listeners to not wonder about the relationship between Israel, Jews and Yemen, an ostensibly hostile, backward, fundamentalist Arab country-- the place, in fact, Osama bin-Laden's family moved to Saudi Arabia from. Saturday's Wall Street Journal fills in some gaps about Yemen and Jews with a fascinating story, Secret Mission Rescues Yemen's Jews by Miriam Jordan. She confirms the country's backwardness and hostility and goes into the ongoing operation of how the Obama Administration is rescuing the few remaining Yemenite Jews and settling them suburban Rockland County, New York in the hamlet of Monsey. (Monsey has around 15,000 people, 112 synagogues and 45 yeshivas and less than half the people there speak English at home.)
I was eventually directed to the Paediatric unit, and took the long walk with a sense of dread and trepidation. Most parents would feel this way on that walk, but normally because they were worried about whatever accident had befallen their child. I knew Mate was fine, they just had to un-Humpty Dumpty him, maybe that's why the paranoia was so bad. Maybe if I was doing the parent panic foxtrot, pacing up and down waiting to find out what was wrong with him, I wouldn't have even noticed it?

We sat down with the Triage Nurse and I answered another series of questions as she examined his head. They were a little more probing this time, dwelling more on previous visits, particularly the bruising episode. Mate had been 6 months old when I brought him in with some unexplained bruises on his arm. He hadn't fallen or anything, it just didn't make sense. That was the start of 48 hours of testing, monitoring and questioning. The Ward Sister could barely hide her contempt for me and what she thought I had done. That was until the second day, when she herself left him bruised after a straight forward blood test. Whilst she never actually apologised for her suspicions, she did offer me a cup of tea for the first time. They never did find the reason he was bruising so easily, but it stopped after a few days and never repeated itself, touch wood.
This Blog is dedicated to all the Software professionals who are working day in and day out to make sure that they succeed in Professional life. Software Industry as is known to the outer world is far away from it. Those who are employer or are employed know the exact truth whereas the rest can only guess.

During the future posts, i will try my best to cover some of the aspects in form of my stories which are based on true "rumors". I will choose the name of the characters which may coincide with some of you. Day 1
"Would you be free this weekend?", Rihaan asked Suhani rather casually. She replied, "yes". This was the green signal that Rihaan was waiting for quite sometime.

Rihaan and Suhani met in office for the first time and there was something that clicked between them. They became close to each other in due course of time.

They started spending time with each other on weekends, since during weekdays it wasn't possible owing to strict professional conditions.   Day 2
Ravi and his Manager Karthik went into a meeting room. Ravi was told to move to Japan as an onshore coordinator for six months duration in the guise of learning opportunity.    Day 3
Mohan had a tough time convincing why he cannot relocate from Bangalore. Bimal, his Project Manager, was self proclaimed ruthless bastard.

He sarcastically made derogatory statements about Mohan and even stated in one of the Team meetings that "People should be flexible if they have to grow". But the most ugly statement which made everyone unhappy was "When one is asked for onsite assignments people jump on to it it's only when asked to relocate within India is when Father's have Heart Attack and Mothers have serious injuries!".

Everyone in the room cursed Bimal.    Day 4
The drama started with Bears & Sterns going bankrupt. No sooner most of the US financial companies started to believe that they will be hit and that too severely. Retrenchment plans were made in hurry and Pink slips started to arrive in hefty numbers.

Indian operations which were not on the radar for most of the time suddenly came into existence. One morning Lehman Brothers went Bankrupt! Sudheer, who was employed in the IT operations of LB at Mumbai, was shattered.

He went to office early that day.The day was Sept. 16, 2008    Day 5
Wasim gave his homely pleasures and moved to Bangalore in search of better professional life. Apart from cultural shock he was amazed at the lack of Infrastructure in the so called IT city of India. 

After spending a full fortnight he wasn't sure of the apartment which he wanted to live in. He wasn't accustomed to the whooping 10 months advance as a security theory! Moreover he didn't had that much of sum.

Not many people outside Karnataka knows that to take a rental accommodation in Bangalore the tenant has to pay a full 10 months advance as a security and the rent is high by any standards perhaps second higher after Mumbai.
Author Donald Miller wrote, “Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself. It is as if they are showing you the way.”  Don’s on to something there… because Bill’s obvious love for the Bible ignited a curiosity within me.  Bill has a doctorate degree.  In addition to being a Pastor, he’s a Professor at the local University.  Early in our friendship, when the aforementioned conversation took place, I needed to know why this intelligent man said such things about the Bible.  I needed to know why I could look him in the eye and tell he wasn’t just spewing out Christianese when he claimed to love it.

In Bill’s sermons, he takes us to the time and place being discussed.  We who listen to him speak hear context.  We learn about the culture of the people.  We are given an insight as to what the text meant to them… how they understood it.  I wanted to know how Bill knew these things, so I asked (that desire for knowledge is actually what led me to the place where I told Craig Gross from XXXChurch that I wanted to enroll in Seminary – which Craig responded to by telling me X3’s Esther Fund would pay for it).  I’ve been learning how to study the Bible, and I have to tell you… I get so much more out of it when digging into context and culture than by just reading the words.   I’ve read through the New Testament four times so far and I get something new out of it each time.
Does this make sense to you? Your mother doesn't let anybody harm animals, and you surprise everyone by those statements!..I dont buy your shit that you didnt say any of it and the cd is doctored..I dont think im jumping the gun either, you did that probably and are paying the price of it..  Why is Shashi Tharoor contesting elections from Trivandrum?..I just saw a flash news of the same, dont know if he has some ancestral connections with that place..If he doesn't, then why!

I have all the respect for Sanjay Dutt. That is, if I ignore his failed marriage, a controversial 2nd marriage(or third, srry ive lost track), his involvement(rather, his conviction) in the mumbai blasts, and the fact that all he'll utter in his campaigns is 'Gandhigiri'(a term thats not his)..

The next time you stand up and question Sachin's honesty I'll take it as a personal insult..and none of you would want that..coz I 'am' the cricket crazy indian public..

Is Austria gone crazy?..A man gets convicted for 14 years, even though the duration of his offense in itself was 25years!..cmon!..

TATA sends me an email telling me about this wonderful broadband connection that has 'not much hidden charges'!!..its written right across the middle..Should I just laugh, or sympathise?

Mira Nair re-releasing Salaam Bombay..Woman are you out of your mind??..The then child artist would still be driving an autorickshaw in bangalore..and if his condition doesnt improve then whats the point??

No multiplex releases for movies after april 3?..Producers digging their own graves..Atleast wait for the recession to get over with..So that you can recover some dough from the stock markets..You've ruled the industry for a long time, let someone else call the shots now..the end audience will still pay the same if not more..

Why..
Why..
Why..
Why..
I ask.
Kuruksastra..... few debates and a walk out Kuruksastra is over. I can proudly say that this time i saw it. For last three years its something i only heard from other people, even though i attended its previous versions but its not more than an hour if you sum up the time.
All in all it was good to see whole college in such a pace with everyone satisfying their intellectual hunger through drama, debate, dance and many many other things. It creates those rare moments when the year recognition is lost and all comes on same floor to compete something which almost impossible to judge. It was Shankar Mahadevan who eclipsed everything in the last evening. The impeccable voice, the aura and the charm which gripped the whole college for about 2 hours and i could still feel his grip on this college by seeing status messages on gtalk, orkut and facebook. I choose sitting in Ctv rather going in and dancing and i really enjoyed, one can imagine the atmosphere in stands.. As far as i can see it was simply Awesome!!!!
The thing i felt is he did not sung those for which he is recognized and admired. To make the mood instead of singing "jhoom barabar" he must have sung "Koi kahe" from DCH. No song from Lakshya and no from his album "Nine", atleast he should have sing "Noor E Khuda". I felt satisfied twice, one at "Maa" and other at "Breathless"... Overall its quiet a time and the feeling of real Shankar Mahadevan standing in front and singing is good, atleast for someone like me who never saw any showbiz personality ever... else than myself :)

Maximum time of these 3 days are passed in NMV auditorium watching Hindi Lits.. Pride of this college.. They win everywhere... If somewhere they did not won means they did not took part, its as simple as that...
The confidence in organizing committee was something, i m sure, every participant was scared of. Vishnupal led the team like Eric Cantona would have led the Manchester United years ago, attitude of the best player+captain could be seen in the confidence of each and every team mate...
If football commentrator Andy Gray would have been there... He must have said.... Take a Bow son !!!! Take a Bow !!!!!
The hard work of organizers was visible in the quizzes they prepared. Especially Antakshari, i think it was solely made by Amitabh and it was Something....
I was wondering how confident participants were and virtually giving lessons to someone like me who never ever even dared to climb up to that stage.
Boys and girls from all the years and from many colleges...

Apart from all this few things which took my attention...
First is the debate.. The confidence of participants was extremely good, i wonder how no one fainted or even a single one wavering. But.... there was a certain lack of preparation, i bet there was... Everyone was talking about something they guess should be rather than some solid points...
There was a certain lack of reasoning and every one was busy showing there ability of argument, useless argument..
Like in finals, topic was about Reality shows.. Many came and blabbered lines of Dinkar and Nirala... "Jo bhara nahi hai bhaawon se......" and all those stuff which has nothing to do with Reality shows. Leave alone reality show, i dont think Nirala or Bachchan ever said anything even on Show business. Instead you should have prepared why are reality shows so hit and why or why not they are affecting society as whole. Anyhow if you want to quote someone, tell us what Stephen Spielberg or Coppola or Prahlad Kakkar said on effect of stars on us.. Quote something relevant rather shouting bullshit....
I dont know exactly what India lost in creation of Pakistan but i can tell what India gained and thats the endless number of debates.. Its Pakistan everywhere, even the partition of states is somewhere related to Pakistan.... One was saying if we want to fight Naxalites we must take guns from all the policemen and send them barehanded... Upon asking to elaborate this he himself do not know what to say. One took partition of State as his topic and end up speaking for 5 minutes on corruption, no relevance at all. If some one someday show the videotape to that guy i dont know will he speak again in his life ???
At last i came to conclusion that there must be Pakistan's hand in my bad performance in class, because its the root cause of each and every problem in India...
time 5! 5 months is a long time..
Even though I've made a return here for a number of reasons, none of them involving any kind of humor(I can hear tht sigh of relief), I'll keep this post short n Kaju-barfi-sweet..
I'll list some places where 5 months are very significant, and some places/situations where 5 months are hardly noticed..  - Waiting for semester to end, mid way into the very first lecture of the sem!
- A bored Govt official retiring in 5 months
- A farmer
- A 93 yr old woman waiting for her first Haj trip
- A Merchant navy guy setting sail..(timez nt too hard on the wife, she has her options)
- Small budget movie producer giving out his first cheque in the movie's name
- An engineer waiting for his company to call(ouch ouch..)
- A pregnant-again woman, who had a miscarriage last time round, in 5 months(sorry, never said its gonna be roses n butterflies)
- A virgin, set to marry in 5 months!
- Period between Friends seasons
- Man serving time in jail, with remorse
- Animals in captivity
- Waiting for that first joint as soon as Rehab ends

And now where its insignificant/time flies by

- Man serving time in jail, without remorse
- Guy West-bound under Student exchange program
- Person working in his dream firm in his dream profile
- Kid of a working couple, growing up(Dual-income-One-kid, they say??)
- Animals in the wild
- Me
- Investors when stock markets are soaring

Next up, issues..

Keep the Faith..
THE REVENG OF THE 'GEEK'!! -  Well ,I am supposed to be Preparing my Market Research questionairre right now... but as my mind is ... it keeps me away from anything important i try to do and brings me back to things like blogging n chatting!!

So , While I was preparing the survey questions ... I realized that all that is happening in this world right now is marketing and business. Companies today rely more on the marketing and advertising than on the quality on their products. They hire the best MBA people in the hope that they can lure more customers into buying their products. And this is the reason more and more people today see more oppertunity in MBA. Even in an Engineering course , companies see the communication skill and marketing appeal of the candidate more than his technical capabilities. That is , if you do not have good communication skills , you cannot expect to get placed in a company even if you have great tecchnical skills.

Even during our UFMR( User Friendly Market Research) class ... all we learn is how to fool people into buying a particulatar product. And questionnaires and surveys are some amazzing analyzing tools which ask people ' HOW THEY CAN BE FOOLED INTO BUYING A PRODUCT ??'
A great example for this is DOVE SOAP , which , on the pretext of reducing the contact area of water and soap so as to reduce wastage of soap due to melting , gave a curved shape to its soap , reducing the overall volume of the soap in the process.And it ws portrayed as a pathbreaking idea while all the company did was to reduce the volume and increase the price.

The best example for this, though, would be POLO - The Mint With A Hole. Even the tagline shouts at peoples faces that it is again reducing its volume by cutting a hole in the tablet. But by the sheer power of marketing , the company was not only able to turn it into a grand success but it made the line - 'A MINT WITH A HOLE' a USP for the product. And to add cherry on top , they released the cut holes as another product too!!

So , no offence to marketing people , but i believe that marketing is just an art of fooling people and Market Research is the art of asking the people how best to fool them!!( No offence to my UFMR sir too...)

That is why , I believe that in today the world needs more and more geeks, who can develop the products he way they were supposed to be and sell them on the basis of their quality, not on the basis of driving the consumer's mind. And when the time comes when 'the world is run by geeks' , it surely will be a better place to live in .
APPLE’S IPAD: FOR WHAT AUDIENCE? 
After years of speculation, Apple finally released a tablet computer yesterday called the iPad. There was fanfare! There was rejoicing!

There was also much criticism: everything from it doesn’t have a camera or USB port to it doesn’t support Flash or HDMI out to it doesn’t let you multi-task. In 24 hours we have dozens of reasons why the iPad will fail in the marketplace.

But what if the iPad simply isn’t for the people who are critiquing it? What if the experience the Apple designers have in mind isn’t the one the tech writers and bloggers have been dreaming about for a half-decade? What if you, early-adopter geek fanperson, aren’t actually the target audience?

Humans suffer from a subjective viewpoint. We see the universe with us at the center of it. It’s almost impossible to gauge anything outside of our own desires…when we size up a new gadget such as the iPad we consider first and foremost: “What good is it TO ME?”.

User experience designers, however, cannot long suffer this fate. We must design (and hopefully critique other designs) from a more objective viewpoint.

As our initial subjective viewpoint fades, we might consider the iPad anew. Judging from the videos and early reviews, it makes many common activities very easy such as email, watching videos, and sharing photos. So let’s ask: “Who out there, what market, is this attractive to?”

The iPad is attractive to people for whom a laptop is overkill. Many spouses, parents, siblings, and children in our lives do not use computers in the same way we do. They are likely the primary audience for this device…the people who don’t need single pixel precision but can get by on single finger precision. They may use the iPad in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, even the bathroom. But they probably won’t use it in the office…

As designers and critics we must get out of our own head. Subjectivity, our inability to see as others do, can be a cruel master.
Hand Made! -  It's been really very long since i have hand written a letter to anyone! May be the times have changed too fast. Even on festivals we just do away with SMS or a courtesy call. I wonder how Archies business is going on!

Those were the days when Archies Card could come "in a very special way", as the punchline goes and makes you happy! Alas, that was taken by e-card and now just email or SMS.

I think we should once again start this tradition of hand written letters or at least Cards, certain emotions are better expressed in original hand writing.

I had few of the greeting card with me which were given to me long time ago on various occasions and whenever i look at them i go back into the memory lane, and believe me it's a wonderful feeling altogether.    Holi - Festivals of colors
Holi is associated mainly with colors, but for me the association is more then that. The festival reminds me of colors, water balloons, gujiya, papdi+achaar, Kanji Vade to name a few.

I remember my childhood time when we use to play Holi with great enthusiasm. Neighbors use to visit us in  groups and pour color on my parents fully knowing that they are already covered with enuf of it. Sometime they use to color my face as well and i use to run away.

What i do not like is the smell of the colors, it has a pungent smell which i somehow don't like. So most of the time i use to wash my face just after the group was gone.There use to be Pooja at home and then Lunch full of calories. I use to love Aloo kachoris at that time. 

It was great fun until sometime later when the whole perspective changed and the fun element went missing and hence i stopped celebrating Holi. Festivities need to be revisited, on a very high priority basis.
those 25 minutes of my life!  hi all,
This time i am writing my blog after a long time. Its not that i was out of content. Its just that i was little busy in a lot of stuffs. But this time i am out here to tell you a story that every engineering student tells when moving out from college and being a part of corporate world. That is campus placement.
So TCS was the 1st company to visit the campus as usual. I wasn't willing to take chances so sat for the very 1st company. Aptitude test was a cake walk. 80 min 35 questions. That too all logical and quant. :) :) But people scared me so much about upper cut off that i decided to score around 70 percent to be safe from both upper and lower cut off. One could have easily attempted all 35 questions and revised the paper for at least 5 to 10 min if wanted. But there was no upper cut off this time. When results came out all those who did more than 30 questions got through. I did 26. 25 were absolutely correct and 1 was pure fluke without even solving the question.

Next was the interview. The thing for which i was most under prepared i guess. I didn't even know about revenue, goals and other details of tcs. Some people were mugging those also in the morning before going for interview. I preferred not to take any pressure and thought of going rather blank for the interview. You can think of my preparation by the fact that i took printout of my resume 3 times each time after adding or removing something in my technical skills and area of interests. One more big confusion of being overqualified for the job was already out of my mind after aptitude. Many people first advised me not to mention my all 3 projects in resume but i decided to put them on the 1st page itself. Because i was very comfortable with them. So i thought if my technical interview goes on these then i will be very comfortable. Of all the interviews posted on net that i have ever read so far had been perfect may be people write it only when it goes perfect. Even though mine wasn't a perfect one i still took some courage to write it. So now i take you to those 20 to 25 min that i spent inside the interview room and let me know how will u rate it..............
My resume and form was asked and after 3 to 4 min a lady came. She called me in. I went inside the room and closed the door behind me and sat down on chair comfortably.(good start didn't fumble i thought in my mind) and yes i greeted them good morning before sitting. There were 3 people 2 technical guys and one lady (hr) who wasn't attractive but i am used to of it being in an engineering college(There is a proverb "all good girls go to heaven and bad ones come to my school")(exceptions may be there though). They asked my name. I told. Then came the first question. Tell me about yourself. I spoke only for 2 minutes. A nice full toss i missed. ( dam me why didn't i speak much. I spoke for 5 to 6 minute when my room mate once asked me same question one day acting as interviewer. )
They tried to ease me by asking how do i feel here. About language problem and food problem they asked. I had to somewhat lie for this question and said people here also speak hindi sometimes( now how many times i have met someone speaking hindi in tamilnadu :)). i like the culture. Food and language are also not a problem. I also added here people are like this that blah blah...... I don't think i ever lied so beautifully ever before. By seeing their faces on this answer i could tell they were not south Indians as they were not overwhelmed. Then he picked my resume and turned to page 2 of it. He asked Why haven't you written Java in your programming skills(i wrote C,C++ and C#.NET). I explained that i know it but i am not very comfortable with it. So he asked 3 to 4 questions from java. Out of them 1 i couldn't answer properly but he was satisfied so moved on to what i had written in my resume. I answered every question very well except one. He asked me what is the difference between c and c++. I don't know what was going wrong with me. Again another full toss and i missed. I told only about how classes work and how structural programming works. Didn't use words like data encapsulation, inheritance etc. Then they came to area of interest in that i had written game design. He asked why have you written this. I explained him that i like computer games a lot and so i thought why not to design one by myself. So i got the chance to explain my project and what was the idea behind it and everything. I told him that i got first prize in Microsoft for this project. They asked a lot of questions on this project. All of them i answered very well.(some of them were very good exaggerated stories). They were impressed. Then he asked me what was the problem i faced in this project. I told them that as it was a strategy game i had to make it very interesting and throw a lot of challenges for players to enjoy it. Again they were impressed by my way of expressing. But one silly question i couldn't answer. My game was on bhopal gas tragedy. So he asked what was the name of the gas released in that tragedy. (f**k..... i was searching this on wikipedia one night before the interview but couldn't see because college wifi was very slow. college wifi sucks i thought.)
They saw other projects and asked some questions on them. I answered very well i believe. Finally they asked what was the thing i learned from these projects. I told them while doing these projects i realized that if we do the analysis and designing part sensibly then we can save a lot of time and work. I explained them how and this one was somewhat right also. ( some times you can speak truth also in interview :P).
So finally my technical interview was over. Now the lady who was observing me from past 15 min spoke for second time. (first she asked in between weather i do these projects by myself or are they part of curriculum. hobby projects of course :)) she asked a lot of questions about me being posted this part or that part of the country. i said i will work anywhere. I thought of saying i can work even outside India but then i thought it would be being over smart. So i kept quite. Then when everything was almost over she asked you are very soft spoken is it because of interview nervousness or you are normally like that. I fell for this one and said I am normally like that. Now she started some chin music and i couldn't have dozed those bouncers as i agreed that i am soft spoken. She said i wouldn't be able to survive in the company and take work out of other people. ( now the only thing i could have done was to hit those bouncers out of the park and that is what i did.) i explained her that how being soft spoken has helped me a lot in my life with some examples. I told her that what all i have done and how i have been part of organizing body of some events and how i have managed to win some prizes on stage performances. They asked some questions on whatever i said. ( i actually made up for that tell me about yourself by telling everything about me in this). She asked me if i faced any problem during organizing these events. I made one nice fake problem and told how i managed to solve it. ( good story in no time i was impressed by myself :P). They were also impressed thinking it to be true one. So they were happy in the end. I too was happy. I boosted every candidate on my way to exit. I never took the smile out of my face during the interview and was at high energy level. :)
So this is how my interview went. After coming out i thought it could have gone much better and i believe it was 60 to 70 percentage of what I should have done. But still if anyone gives his 60 to 70 percentage in an interview it would always be a decent shot.
Next day when after final selection i called home. ( i didn't tell anyone in home before about placement etc until i got placed ;)). Everyone at home was happy for me. My mom asked which one is the next company. I told infosys then my mom said why did you sit for this company then. You should have waited for infosys or waited until someone even better comes. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. :))
Fed up of apologising for not blogging in a while, so i won't. Apologise. Unless you consider that non-apology as an acknowledgement of the need for an apology, and thus an apology in all but the word. Anyway, where was i? Oh,yeah... Over there... *walks to other side of the room, where i was* ...much better. Now that i'm back where i was when i was there, i can write something interesting for you to read with your bodily reading utensils (eyes, mind etc.) Today's funky topics, suggested by folk from that bird-based, social-networking site are Creme eggs, Clockwork Robots and Toe-Jam. So in no particular order (easiest to splurge first) i'll start with Toe-Jam. Toe-Jam and Earl was a video game from the olden days, and was delightfully mental. I liked it at the time, but recently i played it and it was shit. There, that was one of them there video game nostalgic reviews that you can find anywhere on t'internet. I give it a nostalgic shit rating of 3.72/14
visit to school Having been invited(to light the inaugural candle) to the first alumni meet of my school(where I lived from std VI to XII) I eventually made up mind to visit my school(St Basil's School, Basti).Time has always been the biggest inventor of the things, and it did so.There wan't a wall that did not get metamorphed!Right from the Principal's room to the overlooked things such as toilets had changed-changed for the better.A new building had been raised adjcent to the existing main building; and it served as boys hostel.The playground had faded rudiments of the cricket pitch(that used to shine vibrantly in our age).The grass did eat the pitch up thereby announcing that the new generation is no more a fanatic of Cricket, and a good basketball courts speaks of the interest of this generation.

There stood a permanent open stage right at the spot where we used to make temporary ones at each festive occasions(be it a youth festival, sports day, annual functions...).In our time we used be the labelled labours[taking benches out to the grounds, making stage by tying them together and bringing them back to the respective classrooms in the same order!]The permanent stage is a good substitute but I feel it had killed something! ;the joy of escaping from the class legally and doing an odd job between those cranky gossips while sweating badly under the torrid sun!

I opened a classroom labelled "Std VII-A"(that infact used to be Std-XII 6 and a half years ago) and sat on the last but one bench of the middle row-my bench for it still bore my name that I carved with my 'divider(a geometry instrument)' on its right up corner.The handwriting is ofcourse bad when you try hard to represent yourself in the hard wood.A look at the black board made me remember of the faces that had taught me assortedly about this world.I could hear echoes of
Mr. James(our English Teacher) saying "To be or not to be is the question..." while he quoted intricacies of Hamlet's intellect,
Mr. Jaychandran(our teacher for Physics) saying "...the euations of magnetic fields are similar to those of electric fields except for...",
Mr. Jose explaining "...the methodology of ion detection tests have been based on the solubility product...", Mr. Sanjay while caressing his silky hairs "find out the correlation for this distribution and verify..." and so on and so forth.

Later I met with many of those faces; and I must admit that time did fail to change a few of them.Mrs Inan(our English Grammar teacher upto Class X) had exactly the same number of wrinkles she had seven years ago; Mr. Davis(our teacher for History upto Class X) was dressed in a shirt of same taste he had seven years ago;Who says you cannot travel back into the time!!

Then the friends, each of whom was already in some or the other flow of life(as decided by the individual destinies), with some antagoism disappeared while some mutual suspicion getting involuntarily introduced into the minds of the people who had seen each other after a long long break.

No gay governor in South Carolina

They'd rather have the corrupt guy stay in power:
"We can't impeach for hypocrisy. We can't impeach for arrogance. We can't impeach an officeholder for his lack of leadership skills," said Rep. James Harrison, the Columbia Republican who headed the panel.
Can't impeach hypocrisy? Well, at least Andre Bauer is safe.

It may shock you to learn...


...that an anti-gay pol has been caught in a sex scandal:
Detective Bethany McDermott's affidavit says Jetton went to the woman's home around 9 p.m. Nov. 15 with two bottles of wine, which he allegedly opened alone in her kitchen. After drinking some of the wine and watching football, the statement said, the victim "began ‘fading' in and out and remembered losing consciousness several times."

The affidavit says Jetton and the alleged victim agreed on a safe word - "green balloons" - that could be used to stop sexual relations during the evening.
One of BlogActive's biggest fans pointed out that I should have included this snippet from an article in the Kansas City Star:
Instead, the affidavit says, Jetton hit her on the face and choked her before engaging in intercourse. Jetton allegedly said, "You should have said 'green balloons,' before leaving her home the next morning.
Upodate 2: Good. He should pay a price. BREAKING: Jetton to close doors of consulting firm.

Charlie's Angels?


Florida governor’s child health recording directed callers to sex chat line:
In spite of government claims to the contrary, no horny girls are standing by to help your child get health insurance.

It's a state-sponsored blooper for the ages: for two months, a recording by Florida Governor Charlie Crist played when parents called KidCare to get advice on health policies for their children. In the audio, Crist gave a number to call for more information. As it happened, that number was a little off.

Instead of details on child health care, callers were redirected to this: 'Hey there, sexy guy. Welcome to an exciting new way to go live, one on one, with hot, horny girls waiting right now to talk to you.'
birth-day :)  Had a great b'day :) Got many surprises and many gifts :) Am utterly grateful to everyone who wished me today :) But a poem written by Arnav, a dear friend of mine stands out :)  My poem is about Siddharth....
What a sad start to this ode!!
Siddharth is....I'm mad
I'm taking the wrong road!!

I scratch my head and rack my brains
as I look to start this complimenting
but the right words just don't come out
now... Oh! that's the perfect starting

Words are less to describe this man
who downloads many a movie, makes many a plan.
He's devoted to AOL, smart on the street
enjoys blogging as well as many a tweet

His ambitions are unknown, but weaknesses are
His success could be rare, but knowledge spread far
messages are sweet & salty, SJ's are a pain
So he does to irritate, or for other's gain

Great is character, soft at heart
His friends are near but wide and far apart
The smile might not look good at all
But he's worthy to be friends with and give a call

On the day of birthday No. 21
I'd want him to enjoy, have loads of fun
No matter what he might do today
No one forgets the "Siddharth Jain" way

love,
Siddharth
I checked the traffic ahead through the portion of the windshield of the auto which was not covered with Rajni stickers. I was precariously holding on to the dozen plastic bags full of cheap clothing accessories I had bought from Ranganathan Street. “Shit! The traffic is too heavy. I hate Chennai for this.”  As I completed the statement a truck moved close to the auto releasing sooty smoke into the cramped interior of the auto. I strained hard to close my nose with my palm without losing hold on any of the bags.  “Shall I hold some of them?” Sheela offered. I handed over a couple of bags, and checked her face in the rear view mirror of the auto. Beads of perspiration were flowing down her forehead, wetting the sandal in the center. But unlike my weary face, her countenance showed no signs of impatience or irritation.  “Do you need to go home urgently?”  “Not really. But this traffic and pollution is too much to bear.”  She kept looking out of the window at the passing vehicles like a foreign tourist admiring the ethnic beauty of the place.  I looked at the auto driver’s face on the rear view mirror and noted that he too was thoroughly irritated with the traffic and felt some solace for having someone equally irritated with the circumstances.  I turned to see if Sheela was done with admiring the traffic and realized she would never stop. I had met her in the T Nagar bus stop, waiting for a Besant Nagar bus just like me. After seeing the buses overly crowded, she asked if we could share an auto ride. “How is your new job?”  “Well, it is no longer new, but it is good. What about you? Did you … er…”  “Yeah… I got a job. I am a junior accountant at a financing firm.”  “Oh cool… I felt guilty the other day when you said you missed your interview.”  “Hey you don’t have to feel guilty. I might not have gotten selected after all. I don’t regret anything at all.” “It is rare to see someone who doesn’t regret anything.”
When I took a vacation last week around Europe a little bit, there was one thing that really hit me hard. How can I have bosses who wish more for my personal well being than whether I am of “good use” or not? Why am I saying this?  Mr. Boss 1 called to check if I was having a good time more than once during the last 10 days. Second, he gave me his car and also some good advice about why certain things happen certain ways (more spice to those who know it  ) and during the whole time never did we talk about work, or the deliverables that were on my plate (which I did manage to finish before leaving although not sure if he was aware of it). And when my CEO actually sent me a message saying, “enjoy your vacation…”, although I never really did a big bonanza with a project or anything before I actually took the vacation, it tells a lot about motivation and leadership. And I wonder how these guys can be who they are, be great personal friends and still be the whipping task masters if they want to. You guys at Result are simply too good to be true. Looking forward to do more cool things as always :)

Snow started falling as I went to bed on Sunday night. Although doubtful that it'd lie, I set the alarm on my new 'phone for extra early o'clock. I woke to an odd light, the bedroom walls gently bathed in soft yellow sodium streetlamp diffused by and reflected off a thick layer of white. Pure white, blanketing everything. The other thing that was noticeable, at first almost subliminally, was the hush, a muffling of the usual distant London traffic roar.

Transport for London was all blue Suspended and Severe delays but my route to work seemed just about doable. So I piled on my heaviest sheepskin jacket, gloves, hat and boots and headed out.

8am South London was as I've never seen it before. My street was near-deserted, only a handful of sets of footprints breaking the ankle-depth white. No cars or buses. The sky was television static grey with a hint of yellow, promising more snow. Walking between half-submerged vehicles, with no-one else around, I got a flash of Cormac McCarthy's The Road and fancied myself sole survivor of a frostbound nuclear winter. Drama queen.
Its me!!!! - Hi everyone, welcome to my Scrible Pad!!!

Hope you had a great day!!!

Well 'Scrible Pad' is a blog which talks about random topics ranging from what i did today to some of the most interesting materials i found and it can range from an interesting article to a piece of information which might(or might not)be of use to us. Or something fun.....
Its basically my Scribling pad...Will upload a lot of pictures from my own design galery and other sources as well. BTW did i tell ya that i am a designer? so now you know how much i love fashion, graphics, prints, colors, bags and shoes and I LUV 'DOLCE & GABANA' and few more..blah blah blah, the list goes on. 

Well there you go, so Dig in guys and find youself nowhere but right here with me in my world of chaos, beauty, glamour, boredom, expectations, ambitions, bitching sessions, shoes, Bags, citys and much more...so to say 'Expect the Unexpected'...

Yippeee!!! Have fun guys :)!!!
holiday season…   hello guys,
this post is intended for mature audiences, reader discretion advised. 

(its just a line i picked up watching videos at HULU.com, endlessly, they have a lotta free vids, some sitcoms, nude clips, completely legal, very boring movies and so on and so forth. that should tell you what i've been doing)...

people, what happened to the world we wanted to live in, no, we thought we wanted to live in anyways, i cant find one person who says life rocks, and i'm pretty sure this is not because of just the "winter blues". i mean i am so bored, i am practically trying to find out the luminosity of the light bulb in my room so that i can maybe attribute my dull and lazy attitude to it. or counting how many hair are stuck to my blanket (i said reader discretion advised, vide supra, if you think that was grose, watch out), looking forward to that laundry basket to fill up so that i can have reason to go down and wash my clothes (which is not gonna happen cuz i have many underwears and i dont do anything to make my clothes dirty), also looking forward to get some more groceries (which i did the last time i wrote) and so on and so forth. 

a part of the reason, apart from my immense boredom, why i am writing this is that i am sick of discussing problems to my friends, who inescapably feel bad after i miserify them and want to do anything to make me feel better, sick of discussing girlfriend issues cuz nobody has one, and sick of finding reasons for it, which leads to some spirited discussions but m sick of that too, sick of planning ahead to go to a club and then cancelling because the cab company wont pick up the phone, sick of sitting in front of my laptop all day looking for some good movie to download, and waiting for it to download, sick of the buffering time taken by watchthesimpsonsonline.com, which gives my laptop all sorts of adwares but i still go and visit it, no hammer it, till i find an episode that is working fine. sick of eating raman noodle soup (creamy chicken flavour) for breakfast, lunch and dinner with same old set of vegetables and same old flavour, sick of the right arrow key on my laptop thats not working properly and feel free to add on...

if i was a drug addict, i'd have attributed these symptoms to it, but i know that thats not true, so there is nothing wrong with me. its the world thats goin insane...

and oh, this is when i have another 2 weeks of holidays...

enough... i'm gonna get a life, soon...

time to buy some booze i guess...
AVR Programming on Mac

Huge thanks to Dennis Clark for guidance and setting me on this path in the first place!!!

Updated Feb 28, 2010 for Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard" and OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard"

Yes, you can program your AVR-based Orangutan with your Mac! I'm using a Pololu Orangutan LV-168 to control Pokey the robot and programming it with the Pololu USB programmer. Works great! I recently updated the AVR toolchain / programming environment on my Intel-based MacBook running OS X 10.5 "Leopard" and so I've updated this article. Here's the play by play.

Step 1.0: AVR Toolchain

The toolchain software needed to program your AVR includes the following:
avr-binutils
avr-gcc
avr-libc
avrdude
simulavr
I suggest obtaining the tools in the form of CrossPack for AVR from Objective Development. It will support the new Orangutan library (libpololu-avr) and the new ATmega328P-based controllers.  The latest version of CrossPack AVR as of this writing is 2010-01-15 and includes avr-gcc 4.3.3, avr-libc 1.6.7, avrdude 5.8, and simulavr 0.9. It's based on WinAVR 20100110. The old Mac OS X AVR is no longer available and MacPorts' avr toolchain is a couple years out of date.

The CrossPack AVR suite comes as a disk image with a Mac package installer.  It's a matter of opening the disk image then double-clicking the package and going through the prompts.  Tremendously simple, way more so than MacPorts ever was. Both avrdude and simulavr are also included. Neato!

Incidentally if you see the following error (compiling with the new Pololu library), it is most likely because you're running a version of avr-gcc that is too old (4.0.2 in my case):
main.o: In function `main':
main.c:(.text+0xa): undefined reference to `serial_set_mode'
main.c:(.text+0x16): undefined reference to `serial_set_baud_rate'
main.c:(.text+0x3c): undefined reference to `serial_send'
main.c:(.text+0x44): undefined reference to `delay_ms'
main.o: In function `serial_get_next_line':
main.c:(.text+0x50): undefined reference to `serial_get_received_bytes'
The new versions included in CrossPack AVR will make the above errors go bye-bye.

Step 1.1: Configuring Your Environment

CrossPack AVR installs in the directory /usr/local/CrossPack-AVR.You'll want to set up some environment variables to make sure everything works properly when you compile the libpololu-avr libraries.

First, edit your ~/.profile and add /usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/bin: to your PATH environment variable in front of /opt/local/bin or wherever your old avr-gcc was installed. Like this:
export PATH=/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
While we're at it, let's set up the MANPATH too.
export MANPATH=/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/man:/usr/local/man:/opt/local/man:/sw/man:/usr/share/man:$MANPATH
And, we'll want to set up the C include path.
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
We could try to set up the LIBRARY_PATH but the CrossPack AVR linker seems to ignore this environment variable.

Close your current shell and open a new shell window for these changes to take effect. 

Step 1.2 Enable ATmega328P Support

You can skip this step if you don't plan to program an ATmega328P MCU.  The version of avrdude that comes with CrossPack-AVR doesn't support the ATmega328P out of the box so you need to edit the config file and add a section defining it.  This link describes the process. Edit /usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/etc/avrdude.conf and add the text in this link at the end of the file.

Step 2.0: Pololu Software

You'll need to download the Orangutan USB programmer drivers as well as the new library for Orangutan controllers (libpololu-avr) from Pololu's website.
CP2102 drivers for Mac OS X (Orangutan USB Programmer driver)
libpololu-avr, the Pololu Orangutan Library
The drivers come as a .dmg disk image file.  Download the disk image and open it. After the disk image mounts, double-click the "Pololu Installer" icon and follow the directions from there. You'll need to restart your computer when the installation is done.

If you are using a different programmer, you'll have to follow the manufacturer's instructions for getting it ready to use for downloading code.

The Pololu library comes as a ZIP archive.  After you download and unzip libpololu-avr into some convenient directory, you'll need to edit its Makefile to specify where to install the includes and static libraries.  The section of the Makefile you're looking for talks about setting INCLUDE_POLOLU and LIB.  When you're done that section should look like this:
# You can override this behavior by inserting a line below that manually
# sets INCLUDE_POLOLU and LIB to a directory of your choice.
# For example, you could uncomment these lines:
#   LIB := /usr/lib/avr/lib
#   INCLUDE_POLOLU := /usr/lib/avr/include
LIB := /usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/lib
INCLUDE_POLOLU := /usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/include/pololu
Optionally, you can compile the Pololu library from scratch using the command  make clean to wipe everything and then make to recompile using CrossPack AVR's avr-gcc 4.3.3.

Next, install the libraries with the command sudo make install. Enter your password when prompted.

The compilation succeed with no errors.  (Note, version 4.0.2 gave me numerous errors and warnings compiling these libraries as mentioned above).

Step 3.0 Configuring AVR Makefiles

Let's try compiling one of the Pololu examples that come with libpololu-avr. Before we can do that, we have to edit the Makefile.  You'll need to do this with any Makefile you create.

First, we need to fix the linker's search path. As mentioned the linker ignores the LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, so edit the Makefile to add the CrossPack AVR directory to the library search path. Set (or add to) the LIBDIRS variable, which is used to list -L switches which add the specified path to the linker's search path.
LIBDIRS = -L/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/lib
To include the MCU-specific library, you'd use, for example, -lpololu_atmega168 (or whatever MCU you have) when linking objects together.  Set (or add to) the LIBS variable: 
LIBS = -lpololu_$(MCU)
Find (or add) the MCU assignment to specify the device (atmega168, atmega328P, etc)
MCU = atmega168
Instead, if there's a DEVICE specified, make that atmega168 (etc).  The example I looked at uses an AVRDUDE_DEVICE set to m168.  Note that the CrossPack-AVR avrdude will recognize the device atmega168 so you can simplify your project makefiles by using a single variable (like MCU) for both the avr-gcc and avrdude command lines.

Now that you have all the preliminaries set up, time to ensure that the linking command includes the LIBS and LIBDIRS variables. Add $(LIBDIRS) and $(LIBS) to your link command in the correct order, LIBDIRS first, LIBS second, appearing after the list of objects, like this:
##Link
$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)
         $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) $(LINKONLYOBJECTS) $(LIBDIRS) $(LIBS) -o $(TARGET)
The order of command line flags is really important.  You must first list your object file, then list the library directory, then list your library, as above. If you list the library first and the search path second you'll probably see an error like this:

/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR-20100115/lib/gcc/avr/4.3.3/../../../../avr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpololu_atmega168
Make sure the avrdude command is correct (we'll revisit this momentarily), something like this:

    avrdude -q -p $(MCU) -P $(SERIAL) -c avrispv2 -e -U flash:w:$(PROJECT).hex

or like this:
$(AVRDUDE) -p $(AVRDUDE_DEVICE) -c avrisp2 -P $(PORT) -U flash:w:$(TARGET).hex
The variable SERIAL or PORT should be defined in the Makefile as /dev/tty.Pololu.

Also, be sure your Makefiles are using the correct avr-gcc.  Just specify avr-gcc as the compiler with no path:
CC=avr-gcc
Then make sure that the CrossPack AVR version of avr-gcc is in your path via the command which avr-gcc and if not, did you set up the path variable correctly from Step 1.1?  Did you open a new shell window?

One other thing. If you compile and link the static pololu library but you aren't using all the functions, then you're adding a lot of unnecessary code onto your AVR that is doing nothing but taking up space. To tell the linker to prune out everything except what's actually used, add the option -Wl,-gc-sections to your LDFLAGS like so:

LDFLAGS+=-Wl,-gc-sections
Here's what I got when I did all of the above then compiled the libpololu-avr's lcd1 test program:

$ pwd
/Users/mes/Documents/Robot/src/libpololu-avr/examples/atmega168/lcd1
$ ls
Makefile    lcd1.aps    test.c
$ make
avr-gcc -g -Wall -mcall-prologues -mmcu=atmega168 -Os   -c -o test.o test.c
avr-gcc -g -Wall -mcall-prologues -mmcu=atmega168 -Os test.o -Wl,-gc-sections -L/usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/lib -lpololu_atmega168 -Wl,-relax -o test.obj
avr-objcopy  -R .eeprom -O ihex test.obj test.hex
rm test.obj
Step 4.0: Programming the Orangutan AVR

You're ready to download some code to your Orangutan! Here's Pololu's user guide entry on using avrdude with their USB serial programmer (on Windows): http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J6?view_all=1#5.d

The correct command should already be set up in the Makefile for the Pololu library examples and the demo program. You should be able to simply issue the command make program. For what it's worth, the avrdude command should look something like this:

avrdude -p atmega168 -P /dev/tty.Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash:w:test.hex

The argument following the -p is the part number and should be atmega168 (or m168), atmega48 (m48), etc.  Note that this version of avrdude doesn't support the atmega328P out of the box, see Step 1.2 after which you can specify atmega328p (m328p) as a part. The argument following the -P is the serial port; On Mac OS X, do an ls of /dev/tty* and you will see the Pololu serial device driver of your Orangutan USB programmer (it should be /dev/tty.Pololu). The programmer ID is specified using the -c option and should be avrispv2. The -e option results in a chip erase and the -U option is used for writing, reading, or verifying flash, EEPROM, fuses, or lock bits. In this example we are using -U to write test.hex to flash.

Running make program with the programmer plugged in but without plugging it into the Orangutan, or leaving the Orangutan off, you will see flashy red/green lights as the software attempts to find the AVR, then:
$ make program
avrdude -q -p atmega168 -P /dev/tty.Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash:w:servo.hex

avrdude: stk500v2_command(): command failed
avrdude: stk500v2_command(): unknown status 0xc9
avrdude: stk500v2_program_enable(): cannot get connection status
avrdude: initialization failed, rc=-1
         Double check connections and try again, or use -F to override
         this check.


avrdude done.  Thank you.

make: *** [program] Error 1
If you plug in and turn on the Orangutan, the program should be written into the MCU's flash memory. Note that the avrdude command includes the -q option which suppresses the progress indicator hashmarks.  Use this switch when using Emacs.
$ make program
avrdude -q -p atmega168 -P /dev/tty.Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash:w:servo.hex

avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions
avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9406
avrdude: erasing chip
avrdude: reading input file "servo.hex"
avrdude: input file servo.hex auto detected as Intel Hex

avrdude: reading on-chip flash data:
avrdude: verifying ...
avrdude: 7944 bytes of flash verified

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK

avrdude done.  Thank you.


Step 5.0: Integrated Development Environment

Now that you can compile code and download compiled binaries, you need to be able to write code so you need an editor or IDE. But... which editor to choose?

Emacs
I have been an Emacs geek for 20 years (yikes, I'm old!) so needless to say it is my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice. But it is all text-based. Yes, it is an IDE; you can make / compile code, step through errors, run software, and do anything else you can think of (since it is programmable), all within the editor. It is fast and very lightweight (thanks to Moore's Law).

It's old school, but if you learn it well it's quick to use (hey kids, you may not remember the days before menus and mouses, but there are some things that are much faster using keyboard shortcuts). Here's a reference card with emacs key combinations: http://www.geek-girl.com/emacs/refcard.html. 

Fortunately, you'll find emacs on your Mac but working with many files at once is challenging. Instead, may I suggest you try my preference, Aquamacs, a try: It's Emacs with an Aqua interface. It's quite decent and it puts each file (module, header, etc.) in a separate OS X window. I found this tool really improved my productivity -- and protected my sanity. 

Configuring Emacs is pretty simple. To make it as useful as possible, I set up the ability to compile programs within Emacs, as well as stepping through compile errors, by editing / creating the .emacs preferences file to include the following key bindings:

(global-set-key "\C-xc" 'compile)
(global-set-key "\C-xn" 'next-error)

Xcode
Another option is the Xcode editor. David Beck's Blog has some good information in setting up an Xcode project template with CrossPack-AVR. 

Eclipse
And still another option is to use Eclipse, a fantastic, popular, open source, java-based, GUI IDE. It's a pretty big application, takes a while to launch on slower systems, but it is extremely flexible, very nice to use, and powerful. They offer a version with C/C++ plugins that you'll probably want to use for AVR.

One of the folks in a local Colorado robotics club, Dennis Clark, has configured Eclipse to handle both the coding and downloading/programming for AVR. I have the plugins installed but would like to configure it to program the AVR at the press of a button as Dennis did. Still working on this.


That's All

So there you are. If you go through the above you should be good to go in programming your AVR, whether an Orangutan like I'm using, or whatever else. Happy AVR programming!

Big thanks to Mike Seeman's guide on AVR software for Mac. It's a good guide and you should have a peek. Since I needed to get my environment set up for the Orangutan anyway, I wanted to document the experience and provide an updated, simpler guide using MacPorts, in case it helps someone out there, someday.
Identity Theft
Posted by Scott on Mar 15, 2010 in Marketing
Identity theft is something you always hear about that happens to other people. Well it’s happening to you right now and or you are doing it to someone else. I’m talking about a different kind of identity theft… Your businesses identity! Who is trying to make their business look and act just like yours? Or who are you trying to steal their identity? Who are you and your business and what do you want to be? I think many of us are in an identity crisis right now. Are you taking daily actions that are in-line with your identity? Never loose track of what you want to be. Photographers in your area will try to copy, impersonate, or just learn from your creativity. Now I have a lot of great local friends that are photographers and we respect each other. But some people with cameras have no morals or boundaries. The best advice I can give you is that that you should be flattered when people copy you…. Aww bull shit you should be pissed… Pissed enough to step up your game and make it harder for them to copy you next time. I don’t need to sugar coat life’s lessons like your momma did, make it light your fire.
Identity crisis – is your business suffering from one? Most photographers are. Don’t try and be everything to everyone! Jack of all trades and master of none is very true all of the time! We even struggle with identity problems and the new studio is helping us look closer at the future that we want for our business. Boutique is a hot industry phrase but we are evolving into a newer version of an upscale portrait studio of the modern world. What would have been considered an upscale studio 10yrs ago is not the same look and environment that it would have today. “Modern” look is part of out identity and something that we will continue to push towards. Art and products are really a part of the modern look. Before I go to far into our struggles with identitiy… I think you should take a snapshot of your business and really see what your identity is. Not just a purdy picture of your entry, look at all of your marketing, clients, bank account, schedule, etc… Who are you and what is is the image that you business is really portraying? And to top it all off “what makes you different than your competition”?

Not to shabby….
Posted by Scott on Mar 14, 2010 in Marketing
I had that family session today (Sunday) for a good client.  I knew it would be worth it.. They bought 2 gallery wrap wall portraits and a framed one,  plus an ablum, and 25 gift prints.  Cha-Ching not enough for college for the kids but at least enough to get them into a trade school.       I still hate working on Sundays but sometimes I need to put the business first.  I think I worked 3 Sundays this year but just for a couple of hours on each.  Ideally I would never do it, but if I want to claim to have great customer service I need to go above and beyone for a few special people.  However Sundays have a large minimum deposit required… You have to pay to play with me on my day off!

Why am I pumped up?
Posted by Scott on Mar 13, 2010 in Marketing
With out sounding like Hans and Frans I am pumped up about the p90x.  Tonight will be day 4 and I actually can’t wait to do it.  I’m feeling good and I already did my 3mi run this morning, most of the soreness is at least bearable today LOL    I’m glad it’s going good so far.  I wonder how any days most people complete in a program like this before quitting?  My guess is less than 10 days but probably closer to 5.  Watch out for that first day missed, that’s where it all starts to go to hell in a hand-basket….You miss the first day and then two and then two turns to a week and bam you fell off the proverbial wagon.  How much like real life is that?  Something you want to do, or need to do and you start doing it and then you just let it all slip away….  Feel free to call me out if you don’t read about it for a day because I do plan on at least mentioning it on here.  I know some of you are starting it right along with us make sure you keep up posted.  Anyway day 4 is Yoga I think…. Maybe I should make a charity video of that performance…. NOT~!
Ok, let’s change our API in the places necessary to make the phone consistent with our other platforms.

But breaking changes are expensive. Having gone three years without any major breaks, we felt this was a good time to introduce an inflection point, cleaning up our act and setting ourselves up for the future. But we also felt it was important that this be a one time thing. Breaking changes every three years may be ok, but every year, or every six months, most certainly would not. If we’re going to break it, let’s break it good, taking all the pain in one go so we don’t have to break again for many years to come.

So, we took the opportunity provided by the phone to also reduce those nagging Windows vs. Xbox inconsistencies.

We also used this opportunity to improve usability, applying our three years of experience to look at which things cause the most confusion for our customers, and tweaking these APIs to reduce the chance of error.

Finally, we gazed deep into our crystal ball in an attempt to predict the future. This failed miserably (sadly, it turns out I am not psychic at all :-) so instead I made some guesses. XNA Game Studio 4.0 sits on top of DirectX 9 on both Windows and Xbox 360, and we have no immediate plans to move to DirectX 10 or 11, but looking years into the future, it seems at least possible we might someday want to do that. DirectX 11 adds some things that are not in DirectX 9, but it also changes and in some cases removes features. Adding features is relatively painless from a compatibility perspective (it’s easy to imagine how a third profile could someday sit alongside Reach and HiDef) but taking things away hurts deep (it would suck if any such third profile could not be a strict superset of HiDef, in the same way that HiDef is a superset of Reach). So we looked at what it would take to implement our API using DirectX 11, and made sure we didn’t include anything that would make this excessively difficult. I am not promising we will ever support DirectX 11, just saying we did some thinking about this and laid some groundwork so if we ever do want it, we can go there without having to break backward compatibility.
Your lips dont move,yet you talk through your mind telepathically.You could even feel your heart beating with a sense of love. The atmosphere now is,calm and tranquil,and ur minds or rather your hearts could communicate effectively,which gives you a feeling that there is no one in this world to seperate you,and a gentle look at the moon is to just show that your love is eternal and perpetual like the moon.The feeling of complacency can also be sensed which indicates that you had thoroughly enjoyed every moment being spent and no longer need anything more in your life...It looks as if the entire sky is there to protect you,and to keep you closer and even more intimate. A drop of tear would make it even more emotional and passionate,indicating the intensity of your love. A candle light dinner is meant to evoke the lost emotions in your hearts,the fire that has lost in the labyrinth of daily routines and hectic work schedules.
When the world was explored, many exotic creatures and cultures were found. Many of them more tolerant and adaptable than those of the first explorers. The men and women of these cultures were different in  customs, behaviour, speech and appearance, and hence became candidates for brutal discrimination. Man against man perpetrated the most inhuman of all crimes. Then arose a cry for equality, from men and women courageous enough to stand up to their oppressors. And then began a battle without. This battle was of little consequence until men and women of all types could set aside their differences and accept their humanity as their first identity, their equality as a matter of course. Slowly, the tides turned. People became more tolerant. And yet the battle was not won. It is not won. Often, equality has been confused with bland conformity, which resulted in socialist and marxist movements. Noble were their ideals and yet, as history has shown, they were doomed to fall. In hindsight, this is obvious, because every man and woman seeks to be different, to stand out from the crowd, to achieve a higher station in society, to be appreciated.
When I think of the four months after that incident, I feel they were the happiest times in the factory for us. Paarthi became too silent, though he never openly acknowledged what happened that day. He still bossed around people but never came anywhere close to us. I left Johnny at my house and asked father to feed him in the afternoon. Every evening, after work, all six of us would walk to my house. We would play with Johnny for about an hour and then the other kids would walk back home. There were increasingly frequent occasions when the supervisor would leave the factory in the middle of the day and not return for a long time. We would all gather and start chatting idly about various things. The topics varied everyday – sometimes it would be about the latest movies, sometimes about movie stars, sometimes about people in the town, sometimes about our future, sometimes about the fantasies that we think of while working. That day Maari was narrating his dreams. “I want to own a car and drive it through our town, honking loud so that every body comes out to watch the procession. Maybe I would also hit the supervisor with it.” “I would want to buy a large house, like with swimming pool and everything.” Naesappan continued the dream. “And what? Fill it up with half-naked girls?” Mani asked. He usually did not like such talks. “Maybe I will do that too.” Naesappan replied though he did not seem sure of why anyone would want to fill up a swimming pool with naked girls. “Don't start your lecture now about how dreaming is bad.” Maari said with some apparent irritation. “Dreaming is one of the few things we've got here.” Sorna added. “Yes. It is the only thing we've got here. But know that your dreams would never happen. Or we'll end up being more disappointed than we are now.” Mani said.  “Why so? Why can't our dreams happen? We are not going to be in the factory all our lives.” I said.  “Maybe not. But we'd only end up in some other place doing something equally ordinary. Have you ever seen people from our village own cars or houses with swimming pools. Come on. Be practical.”  We all became silent. We all were asking the same question of why such dreams could not happen. It was difficult to digest the fact that we could end up doing such menial work all our lives. Though all of us sensed it, we wanted to still go on believing in the dreams we had. Maari changed the topic before the knot in our throats choked us.
When I was about 15 years old I worked at the Country Club in our small town. One of the grounds keepers would say the same thing every time that I saw him. "Today is history, tomorrow is a mystery."The logic here rings true.. but it was funny as he told me this "mini prayer" almost daily, like it was the first time he was saying it. I would never call him out and say, "Dude, you just told me that yesterday!" I guess that I sensed something was a bit off.. and I'd let him preach his gospel to me based on the inner ramblings of his consciousness. It seemed like he might be getting more out of it than me anyway.The ringing in my ears is due to these same words playing on a constant loop cycle in my brain. After joining EA's Black Box studios here in Vancouver on December 1st. It's just been an onslaught of different trajectories coming at me quick. There is little to nothing that I can say publicly at this point. There are rumors.. certainly lots and lots of rumors. So I will put it this way... Need For Speed will continue...Black Box will continue... and hopefully I will still have a job! The economic outlook means that EA needs to cut costs and overhead.
Pokey V2.0


There's talk of another local robotic firefighting competition some time in May or June!

Pokey's defeat in 2008 has nagged at me for the last couple years so time permitting Pokey and I are going to take another crack at it.

Pokey needs a refit and redesign. Here are some of the topic areas I'll be covering in the near future --

-- but first, what won't change?

No Dead Reckoning

You may recall that Pokey does not use dead reckoning. I want to continue with that design philosophy. Pokey relied on wall following and "events" to navigate -- the appearance/disappearance, while moving, of walls and floor markers.

Smooth Speed 

Pokey was always intended to be a fast robot. His name comes from the fact that I had to slow him down before the original competition to increase navigation reliability.  I don't want to slow him down further. If anything, I'm hoping to speed up the little fella. Also, Pokey was built to move smoothly and fluidly through the maze and I don't want to change that, either.

Budget

Pokey was intended to be somewhat low buck, with cheap, minimalist solutions preferred over fancier, more expensive ones where possible. I may have to admit defeat in a few areas and throw some more money at the problem, but I still want to come in under the cost of a Lego NXT when all is said and done.

Despite the things that won't change, clearly some changes are needed for Pokey to complete his mission and these things will be the subject of upcoming articles.

Navigation Problems


Thinking it through, most of the navigation problems boil down to poor wall following and failing to execute precise turns.

The wall following system was marginal. It could usually maintain a correct alignment but failed to correct even moderate misalignment. A single wall distance sensor was inadequate given short maze walls and a fast robot. A pair of wall distance sensors on each side should solve several problems at once.

While executing consistent, constant radius turns wasn't too tough, reliably turning to a precise heading was. The trigger to terminate the turn was the distance of the wall that the robot was turning to.  It just didn't work.

I suspect using either a rate gyro or wheel encoders -- just for turning, not dead reckoning! -- would provide more precise heading changes and fluid movement. If I can actually pull it off, be assured you'll hear about it here...

Some robots had success aligning to the regulation door threshold floor stripe. This approach alters the flow of robotic movement as it enters the room, but maybe I can live with it if the gyro and encoder options don't pan out.

Flame Detection Problems

Pokey failed to detect a flame the one time he encountered the candle in the contest.  I ran out of time to really dial in the calibration and software. The sensor itself works ok at closer ranges, poorly at long range.  It's big and heavy, limiting fire suppression system options and making Pokey less nimble.


Picture from superdroidrobots.com of Hamamatsu UVtron


Affording (or justifying the cost of) a UVtron or Eltec Pyroelectric flame sensor -- or a CMUcam or NXTcam vision sensor -- is tough. The AVRcam is more affordable and, apparently, just as capable as these other two vision systems. Or sticking with some form of IR detection is still a possibility.

I'm currently exploring some cheap DIY camera/video options. I really think that's the best way to go since the last contest winner was using an NXTcam and very easily and reliably detected the candle. Not to mention, I could reuse this type of sensor for many other purposes. More on vision in future articles. 

Telemetry

One of the biggest difficulties was that Pokey didn't collect data for later analysis. I never quite knew what the robot was doing from moment to moment. I'm working on using bluetooth-based communication for telemetry reporting and logging. More on this in an upcoming series of articles.

Collision Avoidance

Finally, it'd be nice if the robot could priority override all other functions to prevent head-on wall collisions...

Of course the biggest challenge is time... but at least I don't have to start totally from scratch.

Heathkit and Robots

So I fixed up my Heathkit IO-12 oscilloscope and the Heathkit RG-8 frequency generator is next on the to-fix list.  I'm also still working on building the oscilloscope calibrator; it's based on a Heathkit design.

  


Heathkit sold robot kits, too, as you may know.  I remember in college every time I passed the ground floor ECE Building labs, looking in the big windows, being greatly envious of the guys in the lab on the first floor of the ECE Building who got to play with the HERO 1 (as above left).

I guess some of that envy shows in my goofy sketch of Edward Isaac Bot's head, what with the integrated hex programming keypad.  I think it's safe to say that feature would be ditched in a modern verison...

Apparently a Heathkit HE-Robot 2000 is available these days, a rebadged PC-Bot 914 from White Box Robotics. (The picture below is from Retro Thing; presumably they got the pic from the Heathkit site or a news article or something).
WSDM 2010: Day 2
February 6th, 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang
Respond

Note: this post is cross-posted at BLOG@CACM.

Unfortunately, I woke up this morning rather under the weather, so I’m having to resort to remotely reporting on the second day of WSDM 2010 conference, based on the published proceedings and the tweet stream.

The day started with a keynote from Harvard economist Susan Athey. Her research focuses on the design of auction-based markets, a topic core to the business of search which largely relies on auction-based advertising models (cf. Google AdWords). Then came a session focused on learning and optimization. One paper proposed a method to learn ranking functions and query categorization simultaneously, reflecting that different categories of queries leads users to have different expectations about ranking. Another combined traditional list-based ranking with pair-wise comparisons between results to separate the results into tiers reflecting grades of relevance. An intriguing approach to query recommendation treated it as an optimization problem, perturbing users’ query-reformulation path to maximize the expected value of a utility function over the search session. Another paper looked not at ranking per se, but rather at improving the quality of training data for using machine learning for ranking. The final paper of the session, which earned a best-paper nomination, modeled document relevance based not on click-through behavior, but rather on post-click user behavior.

The next session was about users and measurement. It opened with another best-paper nominee: a analysis of over a hundred million users to understand how they re-find web content. Another offered a rigorous analysis of the often sloppily presented “long-tail” hypothesis: it found that light users disproportionately prefer content at the head of distribution while heavy users disproportionately prefer the tail. Another log-analysis paper analyzed search logs using a partially observable Markov model, a variant of thehidden Markov model in which not all of the hidden state transitions emit observable events–and compared the latent variables with eye-tracking studies. An intriguing study demonstrated that user behavior models are more predictive of goal success than models based on document relevance. The final paper of the session proposed methods for quantifying the reusability of the test collections that lie at the heart of information retrieval evaluation.

The last session of the day focused on social aspects of search. Two of the papers were concerned with modeling authority and influence in social networks, a problem in which I take a deep personal interest. Another inferred attributes of social network users based on those of other users in their communities (cg. MIT’s Project Gaydar). Another analyzed Flickr and Last.fm user logs to show that users’ semantic similarity based on their tagging behavior is predictive of social links. The final paper tackled the sparsity of social media tags by inferring latent topics from shared tags and spatial information.

Not surprisingly, a disproportionate number of contributors to the conference work at major web search companies, who have both the motivation to improve results and the access to data that is needed for such research. One of the ongoing research challenges for the field is to find ways to make this data available to others while respecting the business concerns of search engine companies and the privacy concerns of their users.
Sunday Funday!  Got a call from old pal today who wanted to meet me. And since i am not "Busy" i agreed! We went to Ambiance Mall, which i guess is one of the biggest Mall in India.

The gentry was beyond expectation, lots to drool on:)) We also did play pool and then came back for Pizza @Dominoes.

In the end it turned out to be good Sunday rather then usual lazy ones!       Long Weekend!
Long weekend approaching yet again and i wasn't prepared as usual. Too many things going and my mind is definitely working overtime so need a break! I checked for available tickets and booked for Dehradun.

It would have been good if i had a company but then i don't want to be in city inspite as well. I am planning to go to Mussorie, a place where i had went during my childhood days once and have some memories to cheer!

Hopefully i would be able to meet Mr. Ruskin Bond who lives there. His stories about Shamli and Dehra are still so fresh. I have absolutely no plans to have any kind of adventure, just want to be there with the nature and sit back and relax..........
In the second half of 2009 I picked up the Scholar’s Library: Gold software package from Logos.com.  There are literally thousands of resources available within that package.  It makes a computer nerd like me very happy to be able to study from the comforts of my easy chair with my laptop warming the tops of my legs.  I read three chapters a day and try to do so in the morning before doing anything else.  Currently, I’m working through an Old Testament reading plan from YouVersion.com.  I start by reading an entire chapter.  Once finished with reading the text through, I open up a few different commentaries and read what they have to say.  Then I browse other miscellaneous resources that come with the software.  I’m always learning something interesting.  One recent example: it’s thought that Joshua was a skilled military leader long before taking over for Moses, and likely led the Egyptian army in battles.  Maybe it’s my inner nerd, but I find things like that fascinating.  It paints a more colorful picture when I read about his conquests leading Israel.

“Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself. It is as if they are showing you the way.” Indeed, Mr. Miller, indeed.  And so by watching a man love the Bible, and trying to figure out WHY he loves it,  I too have discovered a love for the Bible.  Sometimes I’m frustrated that I can’t find the words to express this properly.  All I can say is, dig into it, and see for yourself.

you are no more, a vestige hanging in the corners 
of my consciousness. the scent of joy was nothing 
but illusion never existed, a conjuration for oasis 
in storms of desperation. the smile you hung on 
your face, a perfect portrait upon flawless wall; 
like scabbard concealed the ugliness of your soul.

It was not until much later during the day that I realised the irony of the title and my predicament. It had not occurred to when I was drinking my favourite four espresso shots ice vanilla latte, on a sunny (to much subjectivity in British terms) Saturday afternoon in my local Starbucks that my colleagues in all the tiresome complexities of office politics, and guy-girl hormones; would perhaps assume, and most definitely make fine gossip of obsession or crush over a Norwegian girl who had just joined the team earlier this week.

It would perhaps, be pathetic and immature to even remotely suggest that any regular decent gentleman (or ruffian) would not be objectively attracted to our new colleague. She, is in fact one of the more attractive people I've had the pleasure to know in my miserable life. I did, perhaps was overly nice to her; but it is part of my nature to all new colleagues. I suppose they would assume I were gay if our new colleague were a guy? My first impression of her was, astonishingly; fear. I am afraid my incompetency in word-smiting cannot adequately describe the emotional stress that bombarded me that day, warning signals flaring in my mind with 'stay away', and 'run'; only to be saved on the grateful knowledge she is engaged. It was a confirmation that I have indeed become caligynephobic.

If there were any women involved in the purchase of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood, it would be from Ireland; not of obsession or crush, but of high opinion on taste. I was not disappointed, and the book was indeed a page turner and it took me a considerable deal of will and with a tiny extra push of my realization of the irony of the title; of one or perhaps four too many of in this sentence.

I would perhaps on a later date write a review when I finish the book, and to which this book will be annoying to carry about in all the unholy opinions that would consult the minds of my colleagues when I carry it in the morning Monday, or should I saw Måndag.

So I lit the fire a fire, isn't it good, Norwegian Wood?
Another charming incident from the past decade is the time when a teacher in my college said to me, "Don't ask questions in class. You're not supposed to. Even teachers don't know everything". Oh, and the other teacher who answered, "That's not in your syllabus- you don't need to know that. It won't come on the exam". They aren't to blame really. They were a part of a system of education that was in dire need of an overhaul. It was a system of education that was grounded in Victorian values of prudishness and "proper conduct", while completely disregarding the inquisitiveness and inventive spirit that spurred on the Industrial Revolution in the same culture that invented the Victorian values. The teachers in Indian colleges are dismally paid, and hence are barely interested, though there were a few exceptions. Is the pay changing in the New Decade? Maybe. Is the system of education changing? I have seen signs of change, promising ones, in various colleges and universities all over India. Unfortunately, there is one thing that will hold Indian universities back- the bureaucracy's utter lack of respect for the students (again, with some notable exceptions).
My name is Henrik, and I’m an Early Adopter.  I don’t see being an early adopter as part of a competition to be first with new stuff. I’m just curious and can’t help that I want to try out and learn new things all the time. And I don’t buy new things until I am convinced that they are useful to me.  It is not an easy life being an early adopter, I don’t recommend it. An old wild west quote: “Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs!” And it is usually not the early adopters that make the money.

But I am proud of having adopted several important trends very early and my gut feelings for applications and functions are often accurate, both for successes and lemons.  Interactive media: I became a pioneer when I started the company Ahead Multimedia in 1988.

Elearning: I created an international award-winning elearning program in 1991, and in 1999 I worked in the US with an online elearning portal about parenting.

PDA’s and smartphones: I switched from paper calendars in 1993 and started enjoying mobile email in 2002.

The cloud: To me this is probably the most important shift in computing ever, moving from local files and applications that are locally stored in your computer to storing and running them online. I started using online word processing in 2005 and immediately felt that this was the future of easy and collaborative computing.  1986 My first Mac, a 512K, what a difference! Used it with PageMaker 1.0 to produce course materials about script writing and print them on my Laserwriter Plus. A SEK 100.000 investment that paid off! I had previously worked a lot with computers such as the Swedish Luxor ABC800. 1990 I bought my first mobile phone, a brick-sized Ericsson Hotline NMT 450, it cost SEK 17.000 and the battery lasted for an hour or two, but it was good to be mobile!  1993 I discovered an new type of magazine that attracted me at the London Design Museum. It was called Wired and wrote about technology and society in a new way. I have been a subscriber ever since. Here is the premiere issue from march 1993, still hanging on my kitchen wall.
Mirror
Sometimes, one fails to see oneself and dwells upon ones image that he wants to potray to the society. Its all a game of illusion in ones mind. It goes like this, if i want to be someone, i train myself to be someone, but then i forget that pretending to be someone makes people fail to see the real me. The simple solution as you might assume is to be truely oneself, well unfortunately the story doesn't end there. I mean its really good for everyone to be or potray truely what they are but then we all are in our own ways of being very judgemental. It depends who can and who cannot stand against other's callous judgements. Anyways, the point i am really trying to emphasise here is that, when one doesn't like the way one is, he tries to achieve to be someone else but what happens is he ends up pretending forever even before he has reached his goal...which means that one lives in an illusion of oneself of how one wants to be seen and thats when people around him fail to see him and he himself fails to see the true him.
Sure, it is a new world out there! Especially if you owned Yahoo! stock last night. After an overnight gain of 48% following Microsoft's bid offer to buy yahoo, I don't blame you if you have a grin the size of a football field.

Anyway, this only brings to focus the new dynamics of the game - How software and business have changed over the past to adapt and embrace the medium of the Internet. So, if you are a CS/IT or a business student, you will do well to take these points into consideration:

1. The net is now the universal computer - the machine where we run software and store data. When was the last time you accessed an encyclopedia or a dictionary in print or DVD form, or get an entire roll of film or card full of images printed? With online applications like Wikipedia, Facebook and Flickr, we are buying less and less packaged software and going online more and more for our computation needs. With traditionally packaged software such as Office being available for use online as well, it definitely signals the "Net is the Computer" era.
How good is a good client?
Posted by Scott on Mar 13, 2010 in Marketing
I have a client on paper that is a good client, however in actuality I cringe every time she calls or when I see her. She has three kids and we have photographed all three for senior pix and all 3 kids she spent over 3k each for their senior orders. Plus we have done their family pictures with another large order. So like I said she’s good on paper. Why do I cringe… Because she follows 0% of our rules. She takes months to order, she pays right away but then takes months to place the order and when she does she submits partial orders and then wants it in like two days. She’s always calling needing something done today she pushes everything right up to a deadline and then calls us on the day of the deadline to tell us about it. (like image submission for the yearbook for all three kids she called us on the deadline day and said I need this now) 3x WTF and this year she did it twice because the first deadline was for the regular pix and then she called for a picture ad page in the yearbook with a different deadline. She’s always changing her mind and has an attitude because she knows she spends a lot of money here so she thinks she owns me. I hate people like that, she is very unorganized and and wreaks havoc on our organized system. Maybe that’s my main problem with her just dealing with her we just feel like we are always fixing her messes. Kelly is sick of her. It was funny a few months ago she did a typical move on placing a partial order and Kelly asked me why I let her do that? I said because she’s a good customer… To which Kelly replied without missing a beat “like hell she is, she may spend a lot of money here but she’s far from being a good customer” it was a shocking thing for me to realize that a good customer and a big spender are two completely different things. And in her case a repeat big spender but still a habitual, chronic, pain in our collective asses! Hehe can you tell she just contacted me again about something… Don’t sell your soul or spine for money. “this is how we do it” our relationship with her would be so much better had I stuck to our policies 4yrs ago when we photographed their first son. Granted she loves us because I’m like no problem.. Right away… Sure… Yes anything for you… Why am I such a stupid person when it comes to her. Kelly is funny when she sees her name pop up on the caller Id she says “you better answer that because you don’t want me talking to her” so if you didn’t notice Kelly has bigger balls than me. But seriously I created this monster and this is their last kid but she’s already been talking about bringing in future grand babies for pix. Oh shoot me now!!! I guess I will have to deal with this situation I need a client intervention, and some bigger balls! lol

Working all weekend…
Posted by Scott on Mar 12, 2010 in Marketing
Well I did it to myself but i’m working all weekend… Saturday shooting seniors and one of the sessions is an outdoor session and it’s supposed to rain.  Then I agreed to shoot a family on Sunday.  It’s a client that has been coming to us for almost 10 years and they own a business that Sunday is the only day they can do it… seriously.  I know a lot of clients claim they can’t do any-other day but a Sunday but these guys are serious.  It’s going to be a very good order I’m sure.  Maybe enough to pay for a year of college for the kids    LOL
Day 3 of P90x not so bad, and actually my best day.  Kelly and I are doing it together it is fun, so even if you hear me complaining it is kicking my butt but still fun.  Not as fun a Sweatin to the oldies would be… I need to get me a Richard Simmons outfit to workout in… Oh that would be sweet!
AND BY THE WAY...
UPDATE:
And I gotta say, pissed as I am about this, I STILL think Brian and Stephen are two of the really great ones in game journalism right now...and I still consider Kotaku my fave site for game news...that said, this pisses the shit out of me....but no need to throw the baby out with the bath water I suppose....
++++++++++++


You gonna fucking quote from my blog, the least you could do is print the whole mother fucking thing. Here is what just got detailed over at KOTAKU:


[I]f I owned the rights to TWISTED METAL and GOD OF WAR, I sure as hell would at the least send a sternly worded legal letter.
Heck, I'd send two legal letters if it were me.
I mean, first Microsoft puts out a car combat game and calls it SCRAP METAL?
Hey, looks like a great game! Right up my alley! Day one purchase for me. But come on guys, isn't that just a little too close to Sony's own car combat game TWISTED METAL?
And then Sony has GOD OF WAR, a game and potential movie about mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods. And then this movie gets announced called WAR OF THE GODS about- yep!- mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods.



Oh my, they left out the last paragraph...you know, the part where I make it CLEAR I am talking about game titles and not Sony suing over game CONCEPTS. What's the matter Kotaku, run out of fucking space on your blog? You couldn't afford to print these last few lines from the original post?





And look: Sony doesn't- and should not- own the concept of the Greek Myths. Nor should they own the idea of mortal fighting ancient Gods, Greek or any other kind. That's all public domain stuff. But the TITLE? Sony DOES own that. And GOD OF WAR/WAR OF THE GODS seem a little too close to comfort ya'll.

Anyway, like I said, not my fight. I don't own shit! :)


Yeah, I can see how that would have really added so much length to the post. What, did you run out of virtual ink? 

Nah, better to remove that part and- in my opinion- make me look like I was going off about lawsuits and thinking that Sony should own game concepts. And let's leave off the smiley face emoticon at the end of the post that- along with the picture of Chris Rock from a Kevin Smith comedy and the title of the original post (also a line from the same Kevin Smith comedy)- makes it clear this was a lighthearted observation and not a serious claim to anything.  Good move there guys. 


Anyway, I hope you guys will cover our games in the future. There are numerous companies and numerous people- not just me- who are busting ass to make our stuff. So I hope we can all count on a fair shake when you play and cover our games. But please- fucking stop covering me. You clearly can't do it right. And please, don't call me for any more favors. I have a feeling I'll be busy.

Thanks.

Break up :( - well after two blogs which were depressing and political and i know many people do not have any interest in politics. Now you must be thinking politics was less depressing than break up (if you have gone through it).Well before break up I wanted to go through the journey of love. What is love? According to oxford dictionary love is an intense feeling of deep affection and great interest in something or someone. But what I guess is that while I am writing this blog really I am not having any words to describe it. really it is an awesome feeling . really yaar its just a great feeling, your life changes.
You travel through ups and downs of life during love. well I wanted to say I do not think that break up is a depressing word. What do you think of? A very great philosopher said that “true love starts when nothing is looked for in return”. So if you are a true lover then praise break up also .you must be thinking that I have gone mad but what I want to say is that why to live in illusion when you have the option to cut it out.
Please do not think that I am encouraging everyone for break up. I just want to say that please do not make love a burden. It is a gift given by god. If you are not in true love you will feel that you were in a mess. I used to believe in first sight love and still I do in spite of the fact that mostly first sight love is infatuation. Please do not go for love on basis of appearance. It is my request. Somethings are ought to be attained with patience. Look for the better part of break up. Understand each other better. Make sure that this is the person you are looking for and bells must be ringing for the person in your heart .
Well after a long lesson I am just sorry if I have offended any body. Please forgive me it was just overflow of emotions. Do not take it otherwise 
This is my religion !!!

I hail from a country that is known for its multicultural, multi-religious, multi-people diversity. For the people of the west, India is a land of mystery that can only be demystified by the understanding of religion and philosophy. As an Indian I know that we are just another set of people striving hard to improve the way we live and the way people around us think of us. It is true that India has so many religions that it could be incredibly interesting to know about all of them. It’s almost like the rainbow, all colors emerging from the same source and still having such different forms and perceptions. But, things are not always what they look like. From a rainbow, it may have now become an illusion, which is so hard to understand that millions of the ‘followers’ are driven to the limits of insanity while trying to find answers for their souls.
I can’t ask you what religion is. I don’t find myself capable enough and don’t expect you to provide an answer that would end all the miseries that this word has hurled upon us. Now, this is a dangerous thing to say. Religion and misery? But, things are quite like this in most parts of the world. Today we talk about global citizenship and economies expanding beyond the political and cultural boundaries and yet we have people with complete intolerance towards others’ views on something that is such a private affair, religion. I really fail to understand why people choose to comment on the beliefs of other people with very little or no understanding of their lives and/or religion. 
I think that religion is all about making peace with yourself and the ‘community’ that you belong to. So, what happens when this process of making peace with you start to intrude into other lives and their right to a peaceful life? That’s when the clashes start and people like us start to question the whole point of having such a structure like religion to unite people. There are other forms in which segregations can be made and a common peace can be thought of, but the question remains, is it always necessary to segregate the society into sects based on one thing or the other? Like always, I don’t have the answer to this question!
Rahul - Those who are reading this blog first time , I'll suggest you to read the previous post first.

While my father was doing all the fee payment work and I was just roaming (admiring) the building, a boy came to me and asked "Are you Abhyuday ?". I asked to myself, "Am I so famous?". I said yes, he told me that he "ALSO" is in 11th class foundation course in here, as if he he knows everything about me. Then he showed his father and my father talking with each other. My father had cosen a room, suitable for me to live in and study, according to every possible condition. Far from traffic , near from garden, at walking distance from the main building, and not “too near to walk”.

While we were resting in the room , my father told me that he has invited that boy(Rahul) to live in this house. That house had 4 rooms 3 of which were already occupied, then Rahul's father mother visited and liked it and finalize it. In the evening everyone came, i.e. Rahul, and the house owner and other 2 roommates, one of them was doing some job and was about to leave in 15 days and another was an AIEEE aspirant, 12th just passed, Ajit Midhan. House owner was a kind man, in the first impression.

That night we(my father and I) went to buy all the stuff essential for living, cup, plate, tumbler, powder, soap , oil, comb, bed, pillow, water purifier, gas cylinder and most importantly two notebooks, as from the next day my classes were going to start, from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. For 2 days my father did everything, woke me up, made tea for me, cleaned the room and my bed, and what I did, just went class. Next day when I returned from the class after having dinner in the mess, which was on the way to class, I did not found him, his train was at 9:00 p.m. I thought I shouldn't have dinner and should have come room early. I felt unsafe, all alone in an unknown place, I was really scared, I was all my own. Then Rahul came and asked me to play cricket(inside the house), we played, and slowly slowly that feeling was gone.

Parents, I tell you, their love and care are undefined. My father knew that I will have this condition that’s why he approached Rahul’s parents, made us known to each other before he’s gone.

For 3-4 days we played cricket and only cricket and did nothing, except going class. One day while I was coming back from the class along with Rahul, I found a 10 Rs note in the road, I bought 2 icecreams 5 Rs each. That was the first thing I have ever bought for myself. I never got a chance, I hate to go to shop with my mother, she starts bargaining from 40% of the price told by the shopkeeper, if it is a salesman, its starting price will be 10% of the price told by the salesman. And if I am with my father, I never ask anything, its his money, if he wants to give me something from his money I should not ask for anything, I should, be very thankful to him. So I don't buy stuff for myself.

After 3-4 days, we (I and Ajit midhan) had a quarrel because of some cricket issues. Then after 2-3 days from that we(I and Rahul) had a quarrel because of a waking up issue. He did not wake me up and went to the class alone, and when I was expecting apologies from him, he laughed at me. Then I met Amul, he was 1 week late for the class. He came to me and asked for the notes , he was from Jabalpur, near to my place.
Reservation Policy and Politics - "Reservation on any cast, clan or sex is undemocratic and leads to inefficiency and second -rate standards". This is the line given by our first prime minister late Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru.It was told when India became independent. At the same time 1948-1949, the father of constitution Dr B.R Ambedkar had a note of caution for future governments that large scale quotas could destroy the rule of equality of opportunity.He revealed that reservation quotas should be consistent with the constitution and must be confined to minority of seats. But do you think that this line is consistent in today's scenario?
DEFINITELY NOT !!!!!! :(
Lets start from the beginning of the Indian civilization. Earlier the Hindu SAMAJ was divided into four major classes (earlier called "verna") namely Brahmins,Kshytriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. Brahmins were at the top of the varna hierarchy, Kshytriys were the second , third were the Vaisys and Sudras(the untouchables). The cast was decided on the basis of occupation. At that time Sudras were not permitted to visit place like temple etc. This was the time which lead to the concept of reservation. Because at that time if the society would have not been divided, it would be impossible to think a word like "RESERVATION".
Reservation in favour of Backward Class was introduced in many states such as Maharastra etc in many fields.In 1902 Maharastra introduced reservation to eradicate poverty amongst minority groups and to give their share in state administration.The notification of 1902 gave 50% reservation in service for backward classes.After that it became a trend, which is an older one but a big hit for collecting votes and publicity in a short period of time. Scheduled Caste (SC) and Tribes (ST) constitute approximately 22% of the country's population. Accordingly a reservation of 22.5% has been made for them in educational institution which come under the control of MHRD and other central ministries. Similar reservations, proportional to their population, have also been provided by the state governments and union territory administrations. SC and ST students are also entertained a relaxation with respect to their upper age limit as well as concession of lower cut-off qualifying marks.Besides reservation for SC and ST candidates,reservation is also provided for other categories of backward classes (OBC). In 1978 the second backward classes commission under the chairmanship of B.P Mandal was set up.The commission, which submitted its report in 1980 and recommended the reservation of 27% of the seats in all scientific, technical and professional institutions run by the central as well as state governments for OBCs. It further recommended that those States which have already
reserved more than 27% seats for OBC students would remain unaffected by this recommendation. The Government of India implemented the recommendations in 1990 leading to violent protests. Besides caste based reservations, there are also varieties of reservation and quota system, for example, Non-resident Indians (5%), Women (30%), Physically handicapped,
Migrants from J & K, NCC Quota, Sports Quota,Anglo-Indian Community, Children of Political Sufferers, Children of Defence personnel, Children of Ex servicemen, Government of India Nominees. The supreme court had earlier ruled that the total percentage of reservation should not exceed 50%, but also inserted an economic clause in the name of what is called "creamy layer".Now this word has become a headache for the government, in the sense of its definition. The norms which should be full filled for the status of creamy layer is still a matter of debate.Later, reservation were introduce for other sections as well. The supreme court ruling that reservations can not exceed 50% has put a cap on reservations. However there are states laws that exceed this 50% limit and these are under litigation in the supreme court.For example the caste based reservation is about 70% in Tamil Nadu. The reservation in Tamil Nadu is much with respect to other part of India.When the first reservation protest hit New Delhi in May 2006, the people of Tamil Nadu were pleading to implement it in the state. When students and doctors in Delhi were agitating by hunger strike and facing water cannon, students and doctors in Tamil Nadu were demanding reservation. Doctors in Chennai ,including Indian Association members, were in the forefront expressing their support for reservation in institutions of higher education run by the central government.Bihar is also not far behind in this prospect(the government of Bihar had given 50% reservation in public sector job for women).

The political issue of reservation in education institution is so important, fundamental and explosive that every time it comes up for debate politicians get into their act. Human resource development minister Arjun singh proposed the bill for 27% of reservation to OBC in 2005.When the bill for reservation (OBC) was presented in the parliament it got about 95% votes in favour. Hence Arjun Singh was successful in alluring a large population in form of OBC.The BJP can't digest such a huge amount of the vote is going Congress' way. It somewhat convincingly asked why minority-managed (meaning Christian and Muslim institutions) are not included in the amendment (such colleges and institutions were not included for reservation). Answering to this question HRD minister Arjun Singh could not hide hide his happiness when he replied to the opposition why minority institutions cannot be included. After that the BJP tried to take advantage by introducing a bill to get Muslim and Christian institutions under the bill proposed for OBC. But the bill was not passed because it lost by a large margin(got only 25% vote in favour).Now after the implementation of these reservation and relaxations the minorities establish and administer educational institutions are becoming so commercial that poor and backward students are not able to afford the fee.Due to this reason in Andhra pradesh alone about 10000 engineering seats were not filled up last year because they could not find students who can pay for those seats.So again its a matter of debate that even after 50% reservation poor students are not able to get a seat in college.

How ever , reservation continues to be a controversial social and political issue and has resulted many protracted legal disputes.Apart form all this, there is not even a single organisation who is working for eradication of reservation. If it continues in the same way then a day will come when every body will be trying to get certificate for SC ,ST or OBC status.Which has already started in the form of "GUJJAR AANDOLAN".
Socrates…  Here is a story quite similar to my earlier post on Kabir's Doha…-------In ancient Greece, Socrates was a great philosopher and
widely acclaimed for his wisdom. One day, a friend ran up
to him excitedly and said, "Socrates, do you know
what I just heard about one of your students called Plato?"
"Wait a moment," Socrates replied. "Before you tell me anything,
I' would like you to answer a few test questions.
It's called the Triple Filter Test".
€ ¢⒠'µTriple filter?" asked the friend.
"That's right," Socrates continued. "Before you talk to me about my
student, I am
going to ask you three questions€ ¢⒠'¶
The first Filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure
that what you are about to tell me is true?"
"No," the man said, "actually I just heard about it and..."
"All right," said Socrates. "So you are not sure if it's true or not.
Now let's try the second filter, the Filter of Goodness.
Is what you are about to tell me
about my student something good?
"No, on the contrary...€ ¢⒠'¶ said the man.
"So," Socrates continued, "you want to tell me
something bad about him, even though
you're not certain it's true?"
The man shrugged, a little embarrassed.
Socrates continued. "You may still pass the Triple Filter test though,
because there is
a third filter - the Filter of usefulness.
Is what you want to tell me about my student
going to be useful to me?"
"No, not really...€ ¢⒠'¶
"Well," concluded Socrates,
"if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good, nor
even Useful, why tell it to me at all?"
The man was defeated and ashamed.
So, rather that spending a couple of hours running up and down the stairs putting her back into bed for that illusive afternoon snooze, my very clever and very lovely wife decided to bring mealtimes forward a bit and put her up to bed earlier in the evening. I guess I’ve been a little blinded by the “she must have her afternoon nap” mantra and hadn’t really considered the alternatives. So I’ll stick my neck out once again and say that so far, things are going pretty well. Meal times have been brought forward by an hour, as has bedtime. Okay, a downside is that I don’t get a break in the afternoon to catch up with a few DIY jobs or to just chill out for a bit, but that’s no big deal. Now, when Mrs D gets home from work, Miss D has already eaten dinner and they can play for a bit, then we pack her off to bed and get to eat our dinner at a reasonable hour and have a bit more of an evening together. Miss D’s legendary late-afternoon tantrums haven’t been an issue either – clever mummy!
The JVM-Garbage To Begin with - Recently I was asked to asked to analyze the behavior of heap in java application (with lots of short lived objects and highly transactional processes).
Here is what I came to know :-
Java is a programming language, where object creation and destruction is handled by JVM itself and this indeed is handled by one of its process called GC (garbage collector process). Four algorithm is available (not specific to Java vendor), For the defined case, gencon is considered to be best.
For most of the cases, gencon policy will work fine
Heap (memory) is divided into two physical part: Nursery (NEW) and Tenured (OLD) Space, Nursery space is logically further divided into Allocated (Eden) and Survivor Space.
New (young) objects gets a place in Eden.

Once the eden is full (or partly filled depends on the setting (JVM option) ), the process called SCAVENGE is called (in gencon policy of garbage collection).

This process will clean up the eden space i.e, deallocates the memory space of the objects no longer in use, and copies the objects to 'survivor' space (or tenured space depending upon the age of object).
As soon as the scavenger is called, the initial eden space is now referred as survivor space (yes empty) and objects in previous survivor space (yes now eden/allocated space) gets their age increased by 1.

As stated previously, the objects can get copied logically to survivor or physically to Tenured area. The destination depends upon the "ThreshholdTenuredAge" parameter (in JVM setting or dynamically set by JVM in default case)

Scavenge process is light weight (wrt CPU utilization), frequent scavenge is called (as the application supposedly had lots of short lived objects)

The major overhead while cleaning garbage is clearing up Tenured Area, where the objects with high age has been allotted space. This is done by GLOBAL garbage collection, which is triggered when the space in Tenured in not enough to accommodate new object from nursery to tenured area (through scavenge; this is called Allocation Failure). Global GC clears up Tenured Area and frees the memory!

Global GC(and scavenge also) is "Stop the World" Phase where the application thread is paused and ONLY gc thread works.
Garbage collection process mainly has three phases (and all the phases work as single step (stop the world, hehe) )
1. Mark - That is marking all LIVE objects
2. Sweep - Cleaning/ freeing and updating free list.
3. Compact - (optional) reduce fragmentation (time taking)

Bad coding is natural gift to all the expert programmers (no offense) still this can get worse if the JavaHeap is not perfectly set, that is BAD JVM OPTION. 

For instance, The JVM OPTION -Xmx512m means set maximum heap size to 512MB and the java application regularly throws OOM Exception(OutOfMemory Exception), tuning is required.
Need not be happy, the above objective case is not always the situation.
The case can be really complicated as improving performance of an application based on Memory leaks or availability is a tough and subjective task.
Google for Java Vendor Specific JVM OPTIONs (depends on version too) and do dome permutation to tune in a good application. However, the theoretical aspect can by analyzed to reduce the set of eligible jvm settings.

In order to analyze the garbage collection, enable the verbose in JVM setting (as the name suggests, verbose (who speaks a lot) is a log which tells the whole story of heap in elaborated xml format. This complicated log can be analyzed on various freely available tool and hence the memory behavior can be studied. Later parameters like fixing nursery size, tenured size, total heap size, size ratio, Garbage collection policy, max tenured age etc can be modified.
Make sure while tuning, you degrade one feature to get another, settle as soon as end user says OK.

Happy tuning
(please google for various JVM options)
GEORGE LUCAS GONNA SUE SOMEBODY


++++++++UPDATE:+++++
I checked out a few boards last nite and it seems this latest post has rubbed some folks the wrong way. Let me try to address here some of the most common complaints some of the game forum folks seem to be having.

#1- I AM NOT SUE HAPPY- I have never sued anyone and unless someone really steps over the line, I look at lawsuits as a last line of defense. Trust me, as someone who gone thru the process of being sued, the whole thing is a nasty, nasty, expensive business and it seems- to me- that it is meant to be. Like burying someone, divorce, our complicated tax system, and so many other institutions of our society that are important but more and more just seem like they exist for the sake of big business, there's a whole lot of people with expensive suits and expensive degrees who make a crap ton of cash off lawsuits. And I sure as hell don't want to contribute to their bottom line. And that is why I suggested sending a letter. I would guess in 99% of cases like this, no one is out to harm anyone else. It is simply a misunderstanding or an oversight that, when brought to light, could be corrected. I harbor no ill will or resentment towards the people making SCRAP METAL or the people making WAR OF THE GODS. They both sound like products right up my alley and I will be purchasing a download and a ticket to each one, respectively, once they hit...whatever their names end up being. 

#2- YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT AT COPYRIGHT LAW AND NEITHER AM I- I know experts in copyright law (I actually do) and you, sir, are not an expert in copyright law. With the exception of MAYBE .1% of the people who are even aware of this discussion we are having, you don't know if my claims have merit in court and neither do I. And frankly, just because you or I think we are right on this, there is no real right or wrong. There is a judge who decides if there is a case and if there is, then there is a jury who decides who wins the case. And there is a lot of gray area simply because- while the law is very concrete- the subjective interpretation of that law requires a human brain. I can tell you that when I saw the titles, they rubbed me the wrong way and seemed worth mentioning. I can live with the fact that I could be wrong and I can live with the fact that most folks may not agree with me. This doesn't make me an idiot and it doesn't make you a genius. YOU go spend your precious time on this planet working with others and giving everything you've got to create some intellectual property and I assure you, you will feel protective of it. Again, being protective does not mean my assumption that these titles cross the line is right. But being a smarmy asshole- like a good % of board posters have been towards me over this issue- doesn't make you right either. It just makes you a smarmy asshole. NOTE: It has been pointed out to me that because my issues are clearly with title and not idea, this is a TRADEMARK LAW issue, not a COPYWRIGHT LAW issue. Fair enough. I stand corrected on the type of law. My comments and thoughts still stand tho. 

#3- TONE- See the big Chris Rock picture? You know, the comedian? See the quote from a Kevin Smith movie that I use for the title of this post? See the smiley face at the bottom of this post? People, I'm not on a crazy rampage about this. I never said I was going to sue anyone. I was bringing it up as something that interests me and something I thought would be worth sharing with people who come to this blog to hear about- mainly- my game making life. And I was doing so in a lighthearted manner. I assure you, this is the farthest thing from a big deal in my life. If nothing were to change on this front, I really would not care. 

#4- FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK- Finally, for the people who are like, "JAFFE! GET BACK TO WORK ON YOUR GAME!"...please, let me assure you, I am working very hard. The team is working very hard. Sony is working very hard. We are all busting ass and- even tho we may not agree on these particular legal issues- we are still eager to entertain each and every one of you with what we've got cooking. Just like you, I don't work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even during my day, I take breaks. But as some of you know, I work at home. So while at your job you may hang in the breakroom with your buddies and chat about last nite's episode of LOST or what game you are playing, I video chat with friends and I blog. Fucking sue me. But the point IS, we are working hard on our game and we're looking forward to showing it to you today on GTTV...oh wait...that's not us :) 

Ok so that's my update. Thanks for reading. Later.

END UPDATE:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ok, maybe not Lucas but Sony should. Or if I owned the rights to TWISTED METAL and GOD OF WAR, I sure as hell would at the least send a sternly worded legal letter.

Heck, I'd send two legal letters if it were me.

I mean, first Microsoft puts out a car combat game and calls it SCRAP METAL?

Hey, looks like a great game! Right up my alley! Day one purchase for me. But come on guys, isn't that just a little too close to Sony's own car combat game TWISTED METAL?

And then Sony has GOD OF WAR, a game and potential movie about mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods. And then this movie gets announced called WAR OF THE GODS about- yep!- mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods. 

And look: Sony doesn't- and should not- own the concept of the Greek Myths. Nor should they own the idea of mortal fighting ancient Gods, Greek or any other kind. That's all public domain stuff. But the TITLE? Sony DOES own that. And GOD OF WAR/WAR OF THE GODS seem a little too close to comfort ya'll.

Anyway, like I said, not my fight. I don't own shit! :)

With what? I hear you cry… Well, keeping my blog updated for starters! So indeed, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to anyone that might be reading this! The last couple of months have been pretty manic and I’ve got a lot of jobs to get finished around the house before our next little one arrives (the due date being 19th April). I’m working hard though, whilst generally running around like a headless chicken. Mrs D just spent the week at the in-laws with Miss D, giving me a chance to get ahead with the main project – refitting our bathroom. Much progress was made although at the moment we have no bath, no plaster on most of the walls, and a “to do” list as long as both my arms. I loved Miss D’s reaction when she first saw it – “Mummy, what happened to the bathroom? Daddy broke it!”. I love that toddler black & white kind of logic, I smiled and told her that “Daddy will fix it” as he does with all the toys and books that Miss D manages to damage or break!
In Kolkata - Here in kolkata the things ,people ,perception of people are so different.The same intro talk which would otherwise have inspired hundreds of youths to join our YES+ bandwagon is also not making any difference. God/Guru certainly loves fun thats for sure. And time & again makes us realize us to surrender since we are instruments and HE is the musician.  In the meanwhile I did few satsangs and quite a few are lined up for coming days. Even attended Vikram dada's satsang and had a knowledge session with him exclusively for YES+ .

I saw AVATAR in 3d which was like superbly fantabulous.Something that's beyond someone imagination.If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favour and watch it. I m yet to see 3 idiots !!!

And right from the day we have landed here the thing i have been doing the most is eating and eating and eating some more. I guess I have also put up some weight.

Will keep ou all posted about the happenings here.

Jaigurudev !!!
I just finished reading Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan by Jake Adelstein after seeing a post on Tokyo Mango about it. I rate it up there with the classic The Enigma of Japanese Power by Karel Van Wolferen and my more recents favorites Dogs and Demons by Alex Kerr and Tokyo Underworld: The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japanby Robert Whiting.  All of these books provide a thoughtful view of Japan from the perspective of a non-Japanese and I think are essential readings for anyone trying to understand modern Japanese history and culture. So much of the really important underlying context and culture isn't translated from Japanese into English and even if it were, it would be mostly incomprehensible without framing it in a Western context.  Jake Adelstein does a great job of making the book very fun to read, personal and accurate. His background as a professional Japanese journalist covering crime in Japan for the Japanese edition of Yomiuri, one of Japanese mammoth newspapers, adds a lot of credibility and cultural sensitivity that are lacking in most books about Japan that are written by non-Japanese.  I also liked the way that the book presented the perspective of the Japanese underground and Japanese culture through personal stories and narrative and didn't try to explain all of Japan. It's nearly impossible, even for Japanese, to understand why things are the way they are in Japan and it's only through experience and listening to stories like Jake's that you can begin to stitch together your version of Japan.   In The Way of Zen by Alan Watts, Watts describes that it is impossible to explain in English, all that is Zen. In fact, the Zen masters explain that Zen is beyond words. He describes how most Japanese Zen masters do not even try to "explain" Zen. He admits that although his Western background and his attempt to explain Zen in words by definition fails to capture the true core essence of Zen. However, he argues that because he lives between both worlds, he is able to describe Zen in words much more clearly than the masters might imagine.   That's what I think about the good books about Japan written by non-Japanese. Japanese often don't explain context or pretend that everyone knows what is going on. I think this leads to a lot of misunderstanding and the development of unspoken rules and culture shared only be small groups of people hidden in most part from the public. Publishers in Japan are also very sensitive about publishing books about taboo subjects in Japanese.  I highly recommend the book.
Thanks to BT FON, BT’s WiFi Network Reaches One Million Hotspots  Together with FON, our partner BT, has reached its goal of building a million-strong WiFi hotspot network in the UK. The vast majority (more than 85%) of BT’s WiFi hotspots are BT FON hotspots and a direct result of a vision Ian Livingston, BT’s CEO, and Gavin Patterson, BT’s CEO Retail, and I, FON’s CEO, had just three years ago.  Back then BT only had some Openzone hotspots in commercial areas. In order to quickly build a truly ubiquitous WiFi network in the UK, BT needed a new approach. BT needed FON.  Teaming up with FON, BT added FON WiFi sharing functionality directly into BT Home Hubs. This made it easy for BT subscribers to become members of the FON community. As members, BT broadband customers who elect to safely share a little of their home WiFi with others, get access to the world’s largest WiFi network in return. Instantly, BT customers who opted in to FON received more access to WiFi, and the joint BT FON network took off, growing faster than anyone expected. In the past six months alone, BT’s WiFi network has doubled. We expect it to continue growing even faster in 2010, thanks in large part to FON.
Round the world tickets (RTW) are by far the most economical way to travel if you actually go around the world a lot. The only thing about round the world tickets is that you can only cross each ocean once and can not leave a "region" and return to it. I had one week between my board meeting in New York for WITNESS and my talk at SXSW so it totally didn't make sense for me to fly back to Dubai and "break" the RTW ticket. I was looking for a convenient place to park myself and get some work done and I remembered that my old friend Eric Haller lived in Costa Rica and seemed to have situation of having broadband ie. able to play World of Warcraft and be immersed in a very relaxing environment.  I met Eric in 1990 when I was working on the film Indian Runner - the first movie Sean Penn directed. I was working for the executive producer, Thom Mount, and Eric was a 2nd assistant director. We were around the same age and were similarly over-worked and under-paid for the few months that we worked on location in Omaha together. We hung out a bit and kept in touch. Later Eric lived in San Francisco and started blogging where we "met up" again. After that Eric joined my World of Warcraft guild, We Know, and still serves as one of my "Guild Administrators". About three years ago Eric moved to Puerto Viejo.   I messaged Eric and told him that I was looking for a place to "park" for a week. He encouraged me to visit him in Puerto Viejo. Puerto Viejo is on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica, not the Pacific side, which is where most of the tourists go. The big town on the Caribbean side is Limon, but there are no flights to Limon from any reasonable US airport.   Eric picked me up in San Jose, Costa Rica with a driver in the middle of a crazy storm and it took us over six hours of pretty treacherous driving across Costa Rica to get to Puerto Viejo. Eric had warned me to bring a raincoat - now I knew why. The road was full of potholes that felt more like mini land-mines, but we made it in one piece.   It was late when we arrived so we had a quick bite at the local Italian place and called it a night. When I got to my hotel room, there was something about the quiet sound of the rain and the jungle animals that sort of made me nervous at first and then jerked me into another reality. I fell asleep and didn't wake up for another 10 hours. I don't think I can remember when I last slept that long. Eric came over, told me to put my watch away and stash everything into the little safe except a photocopy of my passport and a little wad of cash. We didn't have a plan. That was the point. We wandered to the local store in our flip flops on the dirt road. The store had one kind of bottled water, one kind of hair brush, tree ripe bananas, papaya, pineapple and just about everything you'd ever need, but nothing more. We bought a bunch of fruit and headed off to his house.
The Trauma of Restlessness.... Its 1 am midnight and nothing to do. I just lost my mobile as it is took by examination wing, bloody Airtel, they sent me the message in middle of the exam and it wasnt in silent mode :(
Anyhow, just few days back i finished my examinations and as usual i m not sure i will pass all of them.
Now i want to discuss few patterns which i observed while preparing and writing the exams and i find them very critical and we must discuss them.
1. The first thing of all is about Cricket. Last year when we play cricket we use to practise on the main ground instead of going behind sps or somewhere else. Now we all can imagine the rush on the ground and the chaos after 5pm. The thing which needs notice is that the form of all the batsmen of Team gets affected. They scored runs but were not in the touch they used to be in.

2. I also noticed that in a home the kid who got scolded for studies always performs inferior than his sibling who is not scolded. Now dont say that one who didnt study had to face the nagging and its usual. Lets make it more clear. The one who is naughty or say full of energy is first gets the praise of parents and neighbours for his cleverness, but later age of around 8-10 years his naughtiness increases and the parents start scolding him for o a thing or two and then for everything. Also the cleverness he showed(assumed by his parents) is not visible in his studies and the one who is less clever got the same grades or better. And then comes the most common and used phrase "My this child is intelligent but i dont know why he dont study". And its really very good fortune of parents if that clever child shows better performance in his remaining life, because very few did it.

3.This time while writing exams, the only thing which comes to my mind is football. Intermilan, Barcelona, Chelsea and all that. When exam gets over, these things also goes out of my mind.

Now what is the thing linking above three paragraphs ?

Now let me explain you the cases one by one.
First in Cricket there is a term called "Comfort Zone" in batting. Thats why a out of form batsman is adviced to use nets rather than playing more matches to retain his "Comfort Zone".
1st story of my cricket team is that all the batsmen while playing in the chaos lost their comfort zone and lost the touch. 3rd story is about for last 1 month i downloaded nearly 50gb of football and kept watching that in every free time. Now while studies the thing which runs in my mind is football. The brain got a speciality to emulate the conditions you keep it in. and while exams i gave my brain few conditions like pen and paper and it emulate the thought process i use to be in while pen and paper and thats thinking about football.
Now the 2nd and most saddening story.... Everyone catches habit of the thing we repeatedly do. Parents also gets into the habit of scolding their child and which they do, considering it a very small matter. Now a child after nagging when sits to study, cannot achieve a thing which we call is "Comfort Zone". The thing runs to his mind is restlessness, his ego and his brains immediately in a year or two comes into the habit of "No Comfort Zone". This is also trmed as a disease "ADHD" or simply "ADD". And whenever a child sits down to study his brain didnt let him to do so by coming to "NO Comfort Zone". And it could be seen in our socity that usually elder brother is relatively better in studies than younger, becuse the younger one got more energy and of course as he emulates his elder brother, his acts seems to be more clever according to his age, but his cleverness is not at all visible in his grades. And everyone scolds him for not spending enough time in studies. There starts his training of loosing the habit of concentration. The comfort zone is the thing which is so important that you can crack an exam if you retain it and could underperform if you cant. The preperation is not the only thing which matters.
My first DSN September 1999. It was the first time I was attending a DSN course. Rashmin, Rajesh Jagasia, Harshal and a few of our common friends we all were on it. I think it was the first one in Mumbai. Arunaji from Gujarat was our teacher. The intensity was increasing as each day progressed. I had decided I will be repeating this course at the earliest, to be able to assimilate its intensity.  One of the partcipants took permission to go to his house for a while and come back. We all were surprised at his courage to even ask for a break in DSN course!? He looked very happy after he returned. The course got over and he shared his experience.

"I went home to see if my mother was alright. She had just got discharged from the hospital after a serious illness and nobody was at home. To my surprise she scolded me for taking a break from the course and said, "A man in white robes and long hair and beard came and gave me medicines. I am fine. You focus on your course, come on go asap." " There were tears in his eyes as he narrated this.

The power of the grace is infinite. And the Guru's grace is with us every moment. By the end of the course I too had realised that nothing is impossible. "I am the power!"

Next month I repeated the DSN with BAWA!!! An interesting story about that DSN I can tell you only sitting with you face to face, bcoz its kind of a secret ;-)

Well, 10 years later I conducted a DSN in Delhi - Oct 2009.
Hindi Literature  -  Hindi is the descendant of Sanskrit which is written in Devnagri script.It has been affected by different languages such as Turkish, Farsi, Arabic, Portugese and English. It is a very expressive language with rich vocabulary and precise word for each action. Trough its poetry and song it can express emotions, love and nationalism by using simple and gentle words. It has been declared as the official language according to our constitution.In India it is spoken in UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Chatisgarh, Jharkhand and other parts of Inida as secondary language.There are a number of dialects of this language some of them are Awadhi, Kannajui, Maithili, Magahi, Bhojpuri and marwari and khariboli. All the innovative work done in these languages is considered to be a part of Hindi litrature. Apart from this Hindi is also spoken in Pakistan, Nepal, SA, Mauritius, Uganda and Singapore.
The Hindi literature is divided into four major forms they are 1.Adi kaal 2.Bhakti kaal, 3.Ritikavya kaal and 4. Adhunik kaal . In the ancient period the main center of development of Hindi were Delhi, Ajmer, kannauj and the central part of India Madhya pradesh.Chand Bardai composed a poem for his king Prithviraj Chauhan named "Prithviraj Raso" whic is considered as the first work in the history of Hindi literature. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan all most all creative work in the field of Hindi was destroyed and a very few scriptures or manuscripts are available. This era is considered as aadi kaal. During the later part of aadi kaal and early Bhakti kaal many sint-poets became famous and Vidyapati was one of them.
"Bhakti kaal" It is considered as the middle stage of the development of Hindi literature.The work in this period mostly comprises of long poems.There was a great development in the field of poetry during this period. Different form of poems like Dohas and Chupaya are the innovations of this period.Again Bhakti kaal can be divided into two catogeries 1. Nirgrna(the followers of a formless god) ,Kabir and Gurunanak were followers of Nirguna. And 2. Saguna( the followers of God with attributes) ,Surdas and Tulsidas were followers of Saguna. In the very time most of the poems were written in Avadhi or Braj Bhasha. The major works of this period are Padmavat and Ramcharitmanas written by Malik Muhammad jayasi and Tulsidas respectively. "Sur Sagar " written by Surdas was a graet work in Braj Bhasha. This was the age when two diverse religion the Hindu and the Islamic mingled together to server the Hindi literature..Many Muslim poets like Abdul Rahim who was a court poet of Akbar was a great devotee of Krishna and used to write in Hindi.
"Ritikavya Kaal" During this period the erotic element became dominant.This era is called Riti bucause this was the age when poetry forms and theory were developed to the fullest.But this affected the poetry by taking its emotive aspect which was considered as chief aspect of the "Bhakti kaal" and the poetry gradually started deteriorating. The most well known book of this age is Satasai written by Bihari.
"Adhunik kaal" This is considered as the period after 1900. The man who brought life in the hindi literature was Premchand.Before him the Hindi literature was considered as fictitious. He is considered as one of the best story writer and novelist in the field of Hindi.By this time, hindi had become the general public's language. To distinguish themselves from the general masses, the learned Muslims used to write in Urdu, while Khadiboli became prominent among educated Hindus. Khadiboli with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or Sahityik Hindi was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others.importantwriters of this period are Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Maithili Sharan Gupt etc. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Khadiboli popular among the educated people.
Today Hindi is at a juncture where it is being considered to loose its race with English.Even though declared as the National language and official language higher class people and people working in corporate world use it rarely. Hence it is the time when the whole India, the government employee and government funded institution should come forward and make Hindi as an "official language " and the "LANGUAGE OF INDIA".
Scammed ep2 -  When you come to a different country, a lot of things take a turn, I mean apart from your bank balance, which just decides to take a dive and only afterwords does it realize that he (or it) forgot to tie the Bunjee rope!   Apart from that, it all of a sudden changes, for good or for bad, depends on how unlucky or lucky  you are (I dont believe in Hard work!). And there are times that you are led to believe that the whole world is bent on picking on you for no reason. It can start with a small thing, like that innocent lady who walks her dog every day on the pavement and with whom you had a 3 month long 'good morning' routine, ignores you and suddenly starts telling Lucy (the dog) "dont bark at this person" repetedly, or that dog peeing on you, or you stepping on dogs poop, or you dropping your half eaten candy bar which you found under your pillow that morning or a million other things. And then it graduates to your boss at work telling you repetedly how incompetent you are with all his sarcastic charm, or your system at work crashing down, or just one or two softwares which you need to work crashing down, or you forgetting to load the 150 lines code which you had developed last night to your jump drive (I'm not a computer geek, so 150 is still big for me), or forgetting to take your jump drive after you had remembered to load it, or you realizing that you should've just emailed the code to yourself, or, well, you know the stuff!!... What i'm trying to get at is that when all this becomes a part of your life, you end up being vulnerable to possibilities of something good, and at the sight of a bleak ray of hope, you follow it, ignoring the fact that that bleak ray of hope might be coming from the patented lamp made by Hope Inc. and was carried by a fellow with a crooked nose and one eye and a skeleton arm and a flea crown, who just happened to find you in that dark tunnel.

So if your imagination is still in working condition you'd know by now what this is leading to. Yes, a description of another scam. We live in a quite place in Chicago (come to think of it, US is quite in general, unless at war!), me and my roommate are students and are looking for another roommate. On being suggested to put up advertisements online (something you just have to get used to, internet, and we are just not that used to the whole internet thing, and you might wanna contest that but if you dont think its true, youre hardly an Indian anymore). Craiglist, Sulekha (yes it works here too, or here only!!), and what not. But, have you ever heard the saying, 'the best deal is what you pay for', me neither, just made that up, but still, I took that seemingly credible advice and found a paid service that would find me a roommate, 'Roommates.com', i pay for 3 days premium service after i started getting replies on my profile which i could see only if i pay for it (its a neat revenue generating technique come to think of it), and see the replies. 16 yr old Gay male, a transgender, prostitute, transgender, hot looking chick, student, student, hot chick, gay female, student, one who admits she smokes a lot, hot chick, summarize the replies. Hot chicks and students were the first to get my replies, which is any 'normal' person would do. 

Students didn reply back, one Hot chick (please notice capital H of Hot) wants to come and stay. Yes, she doesn want to see the apartment, doesn want any other place, she wants to send the money to me by a cashiers check through her agent who is also arranging for her flight, she sells african beads and is from Spain, she sends her pics and i'm flat (awesome figure, 5 feet 8, sends her pics wearing velvet pants, what do you expect!!), we have long email sessions (the email conversation was almost 25 replies long by now, i even know her philosophy in life, her roommates in Spain, why she went into the bead business, and they were all very good conversations, she signed off with 'your future roommate'). Then it stopped. I have not entertained any other reply from anyone else, cuz she wants me to confirm before she sends money (of course!!), and then she doesn send any reply, nothing, i want to know when is she sending the money, what s the order number (they have that thing where you can track the packages, internet!), I dont wanna spend from my pocket, which is empty anyways. Nothing. I put the ad again, and then she is back. 'Hey, sorry I was in Africa for some business, heres the details, '23-watever-234351!#$' (you can imagine a nagging female voice to go along with it, might be fun), I check the status theres nothing to be found, and after some time it gets delivered... 

Now, what has not been told yet is that my ex-roomie expected it to be scam from the start. I just took him as a sadist and didn care much at first but when i saw a the scam alert on the website, well then you have to stop thinkin that luck was on your side all this time. I shoot an email with the details to customer care and they say 'sieze all contact with this person' and that he/she is a known scammer and that i should contact IRS!! 

In case you are wondering how it works, the check is a fake, however, the banks here make the balance available as soon as you deposit it. Now if you withdraw money from your account immediately, which according to you is already there, and give it to the nice lady mentioned above, then when the bank finds out the check is a frod, you are indebted, and you are labelled as a check frod, and your account is sealed, not to mention your credit history is screwed royally, you would almost never again get a loan or a credit card, or rent a car, or a house, or anything else. I got a check for $5430, when i asked for $1000, first month rent and deposit. you do the math.

PS: be safe!!! be careful!!! peace!!! all these statements cannot help you... 
PPS: in case they do... be safe!! be careful!!
Long has mankind battled and suffered, demons within and demons without. Demons of their own creation sometimes in the name of war, sometimes in the name of recreation, sometimes by an insatiable lust for power and other times for wealth, men or women. How can this list exclude battles for honour? Indeed it cannot. It does not. Demons unleashed by forces beyond our comprehenshion, storms that rip apart a mans life and storms that decimate the collective life of mankind. I have spoken of war now in a generic sense,  for I wish to deal with the specific, in the context of the generic. Long are the hours that I have spent decrying that mankinds fundamental nature is evil and chaotic and yet my heart tells me to keep faith that mankind is true and good. Reality often lies between the extremes of our rosiest dreams and our worst nightmares. And so again, has human nature continued to remain fickle and dynamic, eluding all attempts to classify it as good or bad. Indeed, now an attempt for such a classification seems naive.
Oprah Needs More Social
MARCH 18, 2010 · 3 COMMENTS AND 82 REACTIONS
I was interviewed by Derrick Ashong from Oprah Radio, part of the Oprah Winfrey Network. He was smart, personable, fast-moving, and definitely a great person for this space. The experience left me thinking about how FastCompany magazine said that Ashton Kutcher is the new one to watch on the salvation of media and entertainment. To me, the potential savior list looks a bit different:

* Oprah
* Jon Stewart
* Conan (especially if he doesn’t go to Fox)
* Rick Sanchez from CNN (from the news perspective)

To me, the thing they’re all missing is a deeper integration to social media tools for two-way conversations, for a deeper sense of loyalty and connectedness. Jimmy Fallon does that stuff reasonably well, but then, his show isn’t all that interesting to me. He’s got the social thing figured out a bit better, but the payload isn’t there.

Derrick Ashong, the guy who interviewed me from Oprah Radio made a good moving coming out to South by Southwest, because he showed, in that gesture, that he knew where the stories were, that he could get information from the ground-level stuff that we all uncover, and that he was there to learn as much as he was there to pluck stories from the air.

I think what’s next for media and entertainment will be a hybrid, not a fast shift away. But I think it will also be gatekeeper-free.
When I list the HiDef profile as requiring a DirectX 10 GPU on Windows, I don’t mean that XNA Game Studio 4.0 uses DirectX 10 or 11. It does not: our Windows framework is implemented using DirectX 9. But the HiDef profile requires a GPU with roughly Xbox 360 level capabilities: MRT, floating point surface formats, vertex texture fetch, etc. These are optional caps in DirectX 9, but we need them all to support HiDef (think of it as DirectX 9 turned up to 11). In theory it is possible that a DirectX 9 GPU could support all these caps, just like every DirectX 10 GPU exposes them all when we access it via the DirectX 9 API, but in practice I know of no such DirectX 9 chip. Rather than confusing everybody by saying “HiDef requires this complex set of caps”, it is easier to simplify this to just “HiDef requires a DirectX 10 GPU”. A nice benefit of accessing DirectX 10 hardware via the DirectX 9 API is this means HiDef games can run on Windows XP as well as Vista and Win7.

You will notice that rendertarget format support is still allowed to vary. There were just too many differences in format support for us to successfully standardize this. We have a caps API for querying what formats are available, but more importantly, we have a built-in fallback mechanism. The format parameters used when creating rendertargets and backbuffers have changed from “format” to “preferredFormat”. We will try to give you the exact format you asked for, but if that is not supported, we will automatically fall back to the closest possible match, looking for a format with similar bit depth, number of channels, etc.
I have read many books and novels in which the phrase “home away from home” has come. I had always thought that I have never experienced that feeling and was wondering whether I will ever get that feeling. For the past 5 days, I have got that feeling. I am at the US right now studying at North Carolina State University. I had come down from India on august 20th itself to go to my aunts place at Atlanta. There they are a typical Indian tamil family. There all the time they speak tamil and every day its Indian food. This gave me the atmosphere of being at home. I was thinking all this will go off once I go to my apartments at my university. I came to Raleigh (where my university is located) 5 days back. I was thinking I am going to feel lonely. To my surprise near my apartments itself there were many Indians who were very friendly. However there were two main reasons why I did not feel lonely.
Excess - There is an old saying in sanskrit, "Ati sarwagya warjyate". That means excess of anything is bad.

We can handle things in two ways, one is using it and another is misusing it. Nuclear reactions can be used for getting power (electricity) and also can be used in nuclear bombs. One of my friend had some disease in which he was growing thinner. Doctor suggested him to drink beer, 3 teaspoons daily. Then for 5 years he drunk beer, which gave him no harm. Medicines have alcohol in them, for removing illness. But, alcohol taken in EXCESS is injurious to health. These things were created or invented for some good reason, but everything depends in the way we are using it.

Sugar(glucose) is meant for getting instant energy, but excess of it can cause diabetes. Excess of everything is bad. Teasing a friend in front of all other friend for fun is good and grow relations closer, but excess of teasing can make the person angry and can break friendship. Excess of gaming, sleeping, talking and even studying are also not good.

Sometimes excess of love is also not good[;)]. After a long time, when I went to my home, my mom fed me with all the stuffs, which she knew I like. I was trying to control myself, but, as love was involved in it so I couldn't say NO, and ate everything. And at last I vomited all of it out. Then she realised, its excess.
Introduction This whole blog is dedicated to my friend Tilesh

Carefully read the lines below

1: Names in this blog have been changed to conserve privacy (except Tilesh's)
2: This blog is allowed to be read by Tilesh and his friend and my college friends and specially not allowed to my school friends.
3: This is going to be totally mine (my novel)(first person view)..so it can be a bit boring sometimes.

As Tilesh has requested several times to me to write story of our 3 yrs in Kota, so i m forced to write this.

Once upon a time, long long ago, I became 15 yrs old. My life became a bit interesting. My b'day comes on February, I was in 10th class, in 2003

We had a new principal. I think she hardly knew names of the students. I wasn't so popular student. It was the time of board exams. We had preparation leave. But I came to school to pick up my sister. I was out of the gate of school as they do not allow any student to enter the school campus after assembly gets over. I was arguing with guard at the gate outside, another guard came from inside, and told me principal ma'am is calling me. I thought i should have not argued with this guard. When I went inside principal's room ( first time after getting admission), the principal was smiling, she asked " you are Abhyuday naa", I replied "yes ma'am", and then she congratulated me, and told me that I got a maths olympiad certificate, 1st in Jabalpur region (32 schools comes under the region) and 36th in India. This is the first good thing happened to me AFTER 15.
Second, I dropped a girl(my sister's friend) in my bike from my home to her home, who was considered as the most beautiful girl in my school by my school friends. She is married now.
And so on, now coming to the main topic.
My father was very much impressed by his boss son who went to Kota for preparing engineering entrance examinations, who was 1yr senior to me. He wanted me to go to Kota for preparing for my future. He never told me to go to Kota, but I knew he want me to. Many of my senior from my school also went to Kota. I heard that they teach only maths and science(my favourite subjects), no social studies, hindi , enlish ,(i hated them). So deep in my heart I also wanted to go to Kota.
So after my board exams,and after watching the cricket worldcup (in which India came to final after 20 yrs), we (mom, dad sister and another family) went for south tourism. It was a one month tour. It was from SHIRDI, AURANGABAAD, HUMPI, B'LORE, MYSORE, MADURAI, KODAIKANAL, KANYAKUMARI, RAMESHWARAM, CHENNAI , TIRUPATI, NAGPUR, to SEONI. I had never gone outside M.P. before.
After long trip I forgot all the things about going to Kota and all. No one remembered about it then. After coming from the trip ,with my mom and sis, I went to my maternal grand parents, REWA. Things were changed after coming from the trip. There wasn't a single day when my mom and dad didn't have a quarrel, and those fights weren't small, they were horrible. I had never seen my mom and dad like that. In REWA(my grand parent's home) , there were 2 cousins of my age, Anand and Nandani, were in 10th class too. They got 84 and 80 % marks, nowhere comparison to me (64%). But I got good marks in my favorite subjects (96 in maths and 87 in science). They had begun to study for the 11th class.
I never told them my score, but my dad did, and they never mentioned it, so that I don't feel bad. They asked me what am I gonna do. I told them I m going to Kota. Anand asked me which institute? I was answerless. Never heard of it. I just heard that for preparing for EEEs many people have went to Kota, thats all. Then he told me there are 3 good institutes TCPP, RESTART, BACHELOR. among them BACHELOR is better, then RESTART and then TCPP.
My father called me and asked me that do I want to go to Kota, I already wanted to go, but now I was dying to, I don't wanna see their(mom's and dad's) fights. I thought , if I go , they'll not have time to fight. My father then asked me to get ready for it, as tomorrow I'll have to leave REWA. I wanted to go, but didn't want to leave so soon!!! So I intentionally slept for long, my grandfather guessed it woke me up, and send me to SHAHDOL(6 hrs journey from REWA by bus), with another guy just to drop off me. 6 hrs!!! just to drop off!!! I am considered as a small child. Still, now also, if I tell them that I travel alone for 2 days in a train, no one there would believe me.
From there my father took me to BHOPAL, he had some work there.We reached there in the morning 6 a.m. , after a long journey of 15 hrs. It was my sister's b'day. I wasn't ever away from her on her b'day. Father called her and wished her, then i did. We stayed, for the day, in my uncle's (mother's brother) home. Then we had waiting list reservation for BHOPAL to Kota train, that was late at night, 10 p.m. , waiting list never confirmed. I spent that night sitting. Morning 5 a.m. we reached there, Kota,what I imagined about kota was, there will be big desert, in which there will be just 4 or 5 houses in each square kilometers, it will be too hot. At least one thing I expected was correct, it was really very hot. At 9 a.m. we went to BACHELOR, one manager told that its too late, at 9 a.m. they are having entrance test. For engineering entrance examination we'll have to give entrance examination for this also?!! My father shown my 96 and 87 marks list. The manager told, "it'll now help you, go try somewhere else". Then with all mood off, we went to RESTART, there they told that they have exam today, at 2 p.m. . For writing exams we'll have to fill a form, for filling it we'll need to have passport size photos of me, so there should be some one who can give photos within an hour. we searched and got one. After filling form and having lunch I went to give exam, 3 hrs paper, after a 6hrs bus journey then a night train journey, then a night waiting list journey then this exam. I was really very exhausted. Anyways, while I was writing the exam, my father was exploring the Kota. After exam he took me to Chambal garden, best place in Kota, then he told me about the places I can go in Kota for a mood refreshment, if I have studied too much. Then by a train at night we came back, we never went to TCPP. Result was dated to come after 2 days.
We came back to SHAHDOL, and my mom came back from REWA, to pack up my luggage. After 2 days of rest in home,the time to go to Kota came, father called an autorikhshaw, I was sitting in it with full luggage, my mother came and gave me a water bottle, I saw her, she had 2-2 tears in each of her eyes, I said "mom", she suddenly went inside, pretending as if she didn't hear me. My dad also saw this, while in a way to Kota, he was , a type of, consoling me, "you are not going forever, you'll be back here within 2 yrs, your mom doesn't understand, but you do, I know you do, anyways you'll often visit us in vacations ."
4 yrs after this, my aunt (mom's sister) told me that when I went to Kota, for 3 days my mom did nothing, she didn't had lunch and dinner either, my sister cooked food for 3 days and served to my mom, but she didn't had. My mom ate food when my sister told her that, " if you are not having food then I'll also not have it ".
Anyways, coming back to Kota. I didn't get selected in RESTART, as I told you the exam I gave , was in fully exhausted mood. Father did the same thing, shown my 64% mark list, but it didn't work, again. But it worked in TCPP, they allowed me to join there institute just by purchasing their form. Someone told there that there is another good institute, better than TCPP, called NARNIA. My father was in dilemma, but I wasn't. Nobody in SHAHDOL or REWA knows this NARNIA, but they do know TCPP, let NARNIA be better than TCPP, but if I join TCPP , I'll have something to tell them, but if I join NARNIA I'll have nothing.
So at last I selected TCPP as a better carrier option, we went to TCPP's building to have admission, there I found Rahul.
rest in another post.
