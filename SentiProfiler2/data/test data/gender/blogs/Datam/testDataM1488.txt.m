NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD.I've been ordering prints for a gallery showing this past week and I accidentally ordered one of the prints without matting (it's professionally framed and mounted to styrene, just not matted).  Whoops!  If you want the above framed 10"x15" print of the Aurora Borealis over a barn in Nebraska and are the first person to email me, you can have it for $60 with free shipping to anywhere in the United States.  The usual price for this is $140 for just the print alone ($190 for framed), so it's a huge discount.  Again, if you're interested, email digicana@gmail.com -- there's only one, so first come, first serve! BTW, the shadows of the trees on the barn are a bit of a funny story -- they weren't visible to the naked eye when taking the picture and only showed up later in the photo.  They are caused by the distant light of Lincoln, Nebraska reflecting off of a cloud over the city; the lit up cloud was bright enough to cast a shadow in the long exposure.NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD. Here's an old favorite from near Comstock, Nebraska.  This storm put down a quarter mile wide tornado about 20 or 30 minutes before this was shot -- here it is moving off into the distance.  Sometimes the "golden hour" light of a setting sun into a storm can create incredibly beautiful vistas that seem straight out of an apocalypse.
