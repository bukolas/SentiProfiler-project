Today was an absolutely gorgeous day... I aerated much of the lawns and over-seeded them as well... I will finish in the morning. I wanted it completed before Saturday as we will go from 60's back into the 30's with rain and a possible snow storm. There is way too much to water in the seeds and I will have to leave that to spring rains. I'm not particularly concerned about the cold, as magnolia buds don't appear to be swelling... at least not yet. 

I thought I'd talk a bit today about fall planting....why plant in the fall? The answer is a simple one... deals, deals, and more deals!! ... and when the deal isn't to my liking, I simply say... 'Letâ€™s make a deal'... and frequently they do. Let's discuss this past fall for instance. Below is a whole lot of plants that I got for 50-75% off. This particular nursery was having a sale and not discussing lowering the prices any further.... but they were cheap enough to spur me into the purchase. The downside is that there was no warranty... then again, I seldom lose a plant that has been carefully chosen. A good shot of rooting hormone and they seem to take right off!
