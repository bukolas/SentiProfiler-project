Whether you believe the economy is about to double dip, or fight on and surpass last year's sigh of relief, there is one thing for certain: consumer confidence appears to be on the rise and core industries are once again gaining momentum. 
Building activity is expected to reach new euphoric highs in most states this year, and the resources industry is back at the helm of the national soapbox. Once key national companies start making agressive decisions, peripheral supporting service industries (ie engineering; legal; architecture; project management etc) always see growth as a follow through. 
So, how do you capitalize on emerging opportunities and put yourself in the sweet spot for growth? 
TIP 1: Review the segments primed to move in your target markets and select the highest priority that is the most beneficial to your business. 
TIP 2: Evaluate the quality of your existing relationships in high growth sectors: Are they all you need to support your growth in these emerging high priority areas? Do you need to extend your customer-centric relationships? How many people do you know that influence customer decisions in your new priority sectors? 
TIP 3: Consider how your business profile and key personnel are positioned in these industries. Take a long, hard, critical look at that ways that you can reach out to your ideal target markets in dynamic ways that demonstrate your ability to deliver over and above the market standards. Ensure your business has the tools for communicating in the new economy and your staff have the skills and confidence to lead you out into the market. If they dont, create and implement rigorous train programs. 
TIP 4: Scan and monitor the competition. Are you demonstrating your points of difference and USP effectively? Are you drawing contrast with your competition or trying to look the same?
