Doing Great! I'm really feeling good these days. My stomach is behaving itself, and I'm encouraged by the strength that is returning to my legs. I was able to manage a couple of fairly steep driveways on our yard sale haunts on our Date Day without using the cane. That's quite a victory for me, as I can't remember how many years it's been since that was true. I'm gradually adding back in all the supplements I was taking before my stomach got ulcerated again, and so far there's been no stomach problems. That's a true blessing. I'm also encouraged by my ability to learn about the new programming language that our new sites are written in. It's slow going, but I am gradually understanding how the code is working. I'm very proud of that. I'm still going to sleep most nights at 9:00PM and getting up around 5:00AM, so I'm getting plenty of sleep. I usually only wake up once in the night to make a bathroom trip, so my bladder is behaving, too. I'm getting closer to my goal of losing 50 pounds by April 1. I may not hit the date exactly, but I'm not going to miss it by much. With the lowered rate, and the care hubby takes with his grocery shopping, my blood glucose numbers have been mostly excellent for some time now. Of course, there's the occasional high number, but I usually know what I've eaten to cause it, and learn accordingly. All in all, I'd say I'm in the best physical and mental state I've been in for years, and I hope it continues.
