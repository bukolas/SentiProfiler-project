Yesterday Chief Ican went out to visit Mrs. Westup. He wanted to see the miracle appliances for himself. Amila was happy to see him and to be given the chance to show off the wonderful things that had come into her life. He had her retell him how she got up and found everything there . She hadnâ€™t been awaken by any noise during the night. Chief Ican thought that was really weird since when they put the new hot water heater in the jail half the town could hear the racket the plumber made.
