Achu...the epitome of hard work..A person who is extremely sincere in all his efforts,a nocturnal bird who has almost conquered sleep!( almost cos he is lazy enough to sleep for 2 hrs in a day).a good basketball player and an avid follower of the game.Works brilliantly in a group...Some one I instinctively approach for any sort of help..Its a fast world..when people conveniently give lack of time as an excuse for most things,Achu has been my pillar of strength ..being by my side through my most difficult of times.. I am stopping short of saying a "Thank You" cos Achu will be the last person on earth who would have done these for me expecting something in return..Only a handful like him can ever exist in this world and GOD has been kind enough to let me know more about such an amazing person..He is very clear in his thoughts and where he wants to be in life.. and I hope ALMIGHTY gives me a chance to repay whatever he has done to me, by being with him during his times of need, as he scales greater heights..:)
