We are currently in Year C of the Lectionary but parishes preparing for baptisms at the Easter Vigil have the option of using the readings for Year A for several weeks, including March 21. This is because the Year A readings are especially suited to the Rites of Christian Initiation. So, parishes using Year C readings will find the texts and commentary here while parishes using Year A readings will find their texts and commentary here. Bringing children to Mass with you this weekend? Hints for helping youngsters prepare to hear the Word can be found here (sorry - Year C lections, only).
