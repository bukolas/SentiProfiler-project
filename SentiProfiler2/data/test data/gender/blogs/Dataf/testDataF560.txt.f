Today Jordan and I went to a bull sale. I couldn't stop laughing during the auction; the auctioneer was hilarious and it was just like a movie. Jordan's mom was there, which is why we went. We both tried to make Jordan smile for a picture, but he really didn't want to. He likes to pretend he's a serious, grumpy guy. Also, I was definitely the only person there wearing floral ballet flats. This weekend was full of comfort food. I got a cold, so I made lots of food to make myself feel better. The homemade macaroni and cheese was my favorite. Hello, perfect start to my weekend! I get to spend so much time with Jordan now because his spring break starts today. :) Hope you all have a beautiful weekend. Hello my sweets! I have exciting news! I'm opening a vintage housewares shop on Etsy soon! I've always been in love with things that are sweet and a little bit country, like they'd belong in a cabin, and now I'm doing what I love and opening a shop. Hopefully by the middle of next week my shop will be as full and perfect as I'm dreaming, so I'll share the link with you then.&nbsp; In the meantime, here is a sneak peak of some items I love. My sweet Danny cat got sick yesterday, so we spent many hours at the vet's office last night. &nbsp;Since she already had surgery two years ago, I pretty much lost it when the same problems happened yesterday. &nbsp;Thankfully, the vet doesn't think she needs surgery this time, just antibiotics and prescription food. &nbsp;So my poor fat kitty is very tired and sad today, but hopefully will be better soon. Update I got this text this afternoon. It seems like she's doing better! Hi mom. I'm doin good. Today is my turn to take turn in the Blog It Forward Mashup . The idea is to write about what inspires us the most, and for me that is planning. I plan where I will live... ...what my house will look like... ...where I want to travel... ...my wedding someday... ...drives I want to take... ...adventures I will have... ...and the life I want to live. click on photos for image sources &nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's post was by&nbsp; oh, hey great! &nbsp;and tomorrow's post will be by&nbsp; Oh So Beautiful Paper . Please be sure to go check out both of their inspiring posts! Since the weather has been so nice, Jordan and I went down to the river by his house Sunday morning. There is hardly any ice left on the river, which is amazing because it was completely covered when we were there for Christmas. I can't wait for spring so we can finally spend days outside. I took so many pictures of Parker this weekend! My favorites were of him drinking water during lunch; first he loved it, then he really hated it. P.S. Aren't his cheeks so adorable?! I just wanted to cuddle him all day. P.P.S. I may have been a little selfish and held him way more than everyone else. Sorry! (I'm not really that sorry, though.)
