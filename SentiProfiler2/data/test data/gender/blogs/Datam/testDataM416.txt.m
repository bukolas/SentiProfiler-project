I currently find myself in a much better place than where I was a week ago. Sure, the pain is still there – but it is neither as intense nor as constant as it was just a few days ago. Up until a few months ago, when I was in this same situation, I would have still been struggling for the pain to go away completely. Even though the worst of the flare had subsided, my feelings of anger and sadness would continue to grow. I (mistakenly) believed that I could not be happy until my rheumatoid arthritis went away completely. Now, if the pain is somewhat moderate and focused on only a few joints, I find this a blessing. Better yet, I find myself at peace…and happy. Just yesterday, when I was at physical therapy, my therapist and I were talking at how well I handled this latest flare. Sure, there were a few moments when the pain seemed too much to bear…but as soon as they passed, I got back on track and focused more on doing the things that I needed to do to take care of myself.
