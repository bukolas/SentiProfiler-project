I am a little out of my scrapping groove so this one is a bit of a "meh". I was inspired by the new LPS set {Apple Lily} when making this one of a close-up shot of C. Positive note of the day: I bought these flowers for myself. You can't tell from the pic but the roses are a mix of brown, red and pink tones...so unique! wwillcards Andie's Space stampin &nbsp; &nbsp; Papierowa margaretka My Creative Footprints Creative girls @ Scrap N Craft with T &amp; what we are up TO!

It shows off the newest sentiment set {Everyday}. It uses the Card Patterns sketch for this week. (The Little Paper Shop is sponsoring this week's challenge!) To top it all off, we are having a blog hop today too! You should have arrived here from Jen's site...please leave a comment should you want to have a chance at this very pretty sentiment set {Everyday}. From here you have to go visit Pam (our illustrious DT momma!). Positive note of the day: Took the kidlets for a long walk today. Every moment I spend with them (free from the restrictions of a schedule), I get sad lately about how quickly they are growing up. I always joke with them that I should be like Lucy Van Pelt from the ol' Peanuts strips who constantly pushes down on Linus' head so that he won't get any bigger. As Tristan is quick to remind me, "That won't work, Mommy".

Positive note of the day: Got some super cute pics of the kids today! I want to thank everyone who has privately e-mailed me or commented this week. As you can imagine, I don't really have the capacity to reply since dwelling on my life does tend to get me a little over-wrought (how much Sinead O'Connor, Tracy Chapman and Alanis Morrisette can one woman listen to?). I do want to acknowledge that I have saved all your e-mails in a folder on my hard drive so when I need a little extra resolve, I can go back and re-read what you wrote. The fact that so many of you (especially from readers I never heard from before) took time out of your day to message me does my heart such good now...my gratitude is yours.
