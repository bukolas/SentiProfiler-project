In honor of Fringe's April 1st return, it appears Walter Bishop is celebrating the Day of Fools by donning a ridiculous wig.  Or maybe it's just that Walter's 'do is from 1985.  Yes, we will be having some bad 80's hair flashbacks in the upcoming mythology heavy episode "Peter," as Walter devles into his son's "otherworldly origins" with Olivia.  We'll also finally meet Peter's mother (played by Irish actress Orla Brady).   For those Fringe fans jonesing for a mythos fix, the Spring return sounds like a first class ticket on a Walter Bishop acid trip.   Read on for more head-spinning spoilers.
