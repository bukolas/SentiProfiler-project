Assalamu alykum, official statement here: http://thabaat.net/int/showthread.php?p=128#post128 and Kuffar CBSNews regarding this: The leader of the militant Islamist group Fatah al Islam has either been captured or killed by Syrian security services, according to a statement released by the group on the Internet today. The statement said Shaker al Absi had an appointment with persons who were going to put him in touch with militants in Iraq. The group claims it was an ambush for al Absi and two other members of the group. After an hour-long gun battle in the Germana neighborhood, security forces encircled the area and the group said it never heard from its leader again. The group named a man called Abu Mohammed Awad as a successor to al Absi and pledged to keep up the fight against the Syrian regime. Last month, Fatah al Islam had claimed responsibility for a September bomb attack that left 17 people dead in Damascus. Media reports said that Syrian President Bashar al Assad had told French President Nicholas Sarkozy earlier in September that his security services had captured al Absi. http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/12...y4660290.shtml
