Bradford's in Ghana

Well, we sent off our first missionary. Bradford left Thursday for Ghana.

It's very exciting. All missions are wonderful. The service you give, the growth you make, the testimonies grown, the life changes made, the truths learned and the covenants accepted. He will have challenges but we expect it to be a wonderful time for him.

I made a new blog for his mission. missionarychambers.blogspot.com I just put his addresses up there. I was having trouble up loading photos so that will have to wait until another day.

Primary Temple Trip
Our Primary had a great temple activity in September. It is the 10th anniversary of the Columbus Ohio Temple.

Here's the whole crowd, the Powell Ward Primary. Ellery and the other 11 year old boys were at a campout. Too bad They missed it this was a very special.

Patrick loves the temple. He was very excited to go and learn about the temple.


Here's my handsome Owen. He was so reverent.


We toured around the temple and learned new things on each side of the temple. We enjoyed the gardens and heard the former Temple President and his wife speak too.

Patrick's broken leg
Patrick broke his leg early in September. He and Owen were jump ing off the back porch. It didn't really slow him down too much.
Thanks Quinn for letting Patrick use your wheelchair!

He has this spiffy new cast for the next three weeks.

Little Zoo Trip
Patrick and Owen at the zoo

Patrick has been waiting and waiting for a trip to the zoo. Yesterday we went for a couple of hours.

We rode the train. They have never done that before. It was fun!
