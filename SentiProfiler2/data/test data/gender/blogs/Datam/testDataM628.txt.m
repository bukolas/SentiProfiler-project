so here i go.. writing a testi(for saving myself from the pester???!!!!!! :D).. anyways.. let me do it.. to start with she moves so very well even with strangers that gets her so many friends.. an then builds it all with her silly talks and dumb mokkas.. an acknowledges them too!! but the big prob in being one is she never stops asking for treats.. may be u must ask her how many she says are pending from me.. but all in all she is much more than wat am saying right now.. wonderful memories can only be shared wit a few ppl and she s one i must say.. talking as innocent as a child an doin all stuff behind is not somethin new to her.. an singing is onrthing that she s adept at.. an the best part is that she does wat she wants.. doesnt do something just because a group of friends do it.. good individualistic approach i must say!!! a very interestin character is all that i can say to finsih this off.. keep rocking dear mate.. 
P.S: yabbbbbaaaaaaaa.. inime escape!!!!!!!
