I started this blog back my junior year of college. I worked at a college radio station and wanted to use another way to show my passion for college football and the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame so I started this. Why the misspelled "tho" you ask? Anyone who knows me well knows that I strongly represent the "spell check" generation and struggle at times with common spellings of words. Just a little play on words, enjoy the site and let me know if you have anything for me. Thanks for checking it out.
