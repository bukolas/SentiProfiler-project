For a number of years now, Circle has distributed holiday e-greetings (past cards drew from Chinese proverbs , ancient rune translations , etc. ) . I'm sure that you've seen (or at least heard of) some of the many , Lady Gaga - Poker Face spoofs floating around on the internet... a couple of my personal favorites, Christopher Walken's reading of Poker Face , and the UC Berkeley's Noteworthy performing Poker Face . ;) Well, above is another one... ;P Neutra Face (this one is more geared towards typographers/designers). Check out the video embedded above or on Youtube , here - enjoy! If you like typography, and/or posters (I like both), I highly recommend you check out www.typographicposters.com ... an online collection of largely type-based posters from around the globe... sweet!

New Media Manitoba (NMM) held their 2009 Holiday Showcase at the IMAX Theatre, Portage Place yesterday evening. It was delightful (and inspiring) to see local digital media practitioners on the IMAX big screen. The sold-out event was well attended by a diverse range of local professionals, and proved to be an excellent place to meet and converse, with individuals who were truly passionate about their respective crafts/industries. The highlight/feature of the evening was the approximate 45 minute, NMM Business Showcase video(s) produced by BlinkWorks: Film and Video Production , you can check out the videos via BlinkWorks' website , here ). Andrew Boardman 's (MGDC, GDC Manitoba Chapter Membership Chair), MANOVERBOARD was one of the local companies profiled, check out the profile video embedded above or on on Vimeo , here . Be sure to check out the other videos as well at BlinkWorks: Film and Video Production . You can see my photos from the NMM 2009 Holiday Showcase (Photoset) on Flickr . Cheers! A few months have passed since the grand opening of Winnipeg's greenest , eco-friendly salon, Berns & Black located at 468 Main Street (in the old Birt Saddlery building - Main and Bannatyne)... it has now become my salon destination of choice . ;) Check out this video (taken before the grand opening) I came across on Youtube ... A number of factors influenced my decision... but, mainly, it's conveniently located in the Exchange District (within walking distance from Circle ), it's dedicated to being eco-friendly(+) &#8211; plus, the staff, service, product selection (and decor) is second to none. On my most recent visit, I took the opportunity to take a few quick pics ... my apologies as they really don't do the space justice. The decor is very cool IMO... Hanging on one of the walls was this shadow-box display, housing authentic tools from Anthony Berns Barbershop (c.1951) . :D Berns & Black offers salon and spa services (including straight razor shaves for men)... I highly recommend that you check it out! If you're looking for a new stylist, ask for Kitty... you won't be disappointed (tell her I sent 'ya) . You can read more about Berns & Black online via the Winnipeg Free Press and the Winnipeg Sun , here and here . Berns & Black is open at 9:00 am Monday thru Saturday (closing hours vary), walk-ins are welcome, but pre-booking is recommended. For more information, or to book an appointment call (204) 944 8454. Cheers! David Thorne is an Australian humorist, satirist, internet personality and author. I was recently introduced to his work via a link my brother sent me... where he came across it, I'm not sure. 27b/6 is his website, which you can read more about on Wikipedia ... Anyhow, the link my brother sent me was to a recent post on 27b/6 , which seemed to address the issue of spec work (visit http://www.no-spec.com/ ). I couldn't help but laugh after reading this . If you're a designer, or in the creative field, I'm sure that you've been asked (at least once) to do work on spec... most of us just say no, although I'm sure that we've been tempted to say more . ;) Thanks for the link bro! Visit 27b/6 and read the post yourself ... enjoy! I'm sure that this video , posted to Vimeo by John Carrera , has made it's way around the 'blogosphere' already, but it's just too cool to not post about. Like the folks over at GOOD magazine , I could watch this video , over and over again, and still be left in awe. Enjoy!
