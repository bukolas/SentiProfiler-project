I love me my Star Wars.

No, seriously. My first memory is of watching Return of the Jedi. Even though I felt deeply nonplussed by Killer Klones and Revenge of the Mediocre, I am still George Lucas’s bitch. I’ve bought the VHS, the DVD. I have Action Figures. Mini-Lego Sets. I ran a goddamn Star Wars D20 game.

I would not be surprised that my individual contribution probably paid for Jett’s braces.

So a few years ago Republic Commando comes out for the PC and Xbox. It gets good reviews, but I hold off, waiting for a price drop. It hits the bargain rack, but I have a huge backlog… and I’ll be back in Walmart next week.

There’s always another time.

Well, oops. Republic Commando left the bargain rack, and I figured that the game had passed me by. Then along comes Steam and its fiendish Holiday Sale (the number one reason why posters in the GESC will never finish that novel, that iPhone app, or rake that layer of leaves resting on the lawn). 5 bucks! Hot damn! Five bucks!

Click. Sold.

Having just gotten done with Batman: Arkham Asylum, I wanted something quick and zippy. Republic Commando fit the bill. Let’s see how well it stands the test of time.

At first, I was seriously meh. I had just finished Arkham Asylum, a gaming equivalent of The Dark Knight. You know why it’s been roundly praised as 2009’s Game of the Year? You’re the GODDAMN BATMAN! No, seriously. It’s the closest thing you’ll get to being an unhinged badass vigilante mofo with impeccable controls and incredible design.

And then along comes Republic Commando, a very decent licensed squad-based shooter. It felt like weak sauce. Decent is good. Would that more games were decent. After 2009’s GOTY, decent just felt… decent.

The first third of Republic Commando feels like a well-done generic squad shooter. Simple commands? Check. Weapons? Standard fare. License? Effective. Levels? Acceptable. Controls? Floaty. I spent most of the time feeling like I was piloting an underpowered floating turret. My assault rifle… just didn’t do much assaulting. Hell, I used my pistol as my go-to weapon – at least I wasn’t wasting ammo. On top of that, the level design just felt bland. I turned to my girlfriend and told her that it was just a bit of a bore.

Did I just waste five bucks?

The next night, I tackled the Assault Ship campaign, and suddenly things started getting better. Sure there was some copy/paste level design with ship corridors, but overall, I felt far more immersed in the game. Blasting flying bugs in a brown landscape? Been there, done that. Crawling through the guts of a “star destroyer” (Republic Assault Ship. I know. There’s a difference.), checking corners, breaching doors, and rescuing downed comrades? Hell yeah! That’s what Genndy Tartakovsky is all about.

Last night, I decided to put this baby to bed. The Kashyyyk campaign finally felt like a full-on Star Wars experience. You finally had decent weapons, your squad seemed to have stepped up its game, and the environments and levels stopped feeling generic. More than that, they got the final battles “right.” In fact, there wasn’t a final battle, per se. You traversed a collection of skirmishes with your team doing door breaches so that you could take down a Separatist Cruiser with cannon fire. Like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, there is no final boss, just a final level that tests your skills. When that cruiser came down, it was the exclamation point at the end of a satisfying endurance test.

I was immensely impressed. Most games peter out by the end. Republic Commando just kept getting better. That said, the game did have a number of flaws.

First: the base weapons suck. I rarely felt like I had a weapon in my hand. It wasn’t until the second campaign where you get the shotgun and the repeater that you actually feel you can open up a can of whoopass. Once the shotty became available, I only used the assault rifle against droids or when I ran out of ammo. 

What are we supposed to use? Harsh language?

Also, the graphics are dated. Duh. But still, there were some character models that were embarrassingly low-poly. Wookiees? They looked like they were rendered in the Dark Engine. The environments? Cohesive but unimpressive textures. Your squad looked great (thankfully), but you can definitely tell that the game has not aged as gracefully as it could have. It did, however, run nicely on a bootcamped Macbook White on Max Settings.

Also, you can definitely tell that the levels were designed for the Xbox. Yup. Loading screen. Loading Screen. Walk to the next building. Loading Screen. Oh! Hi! Alex Denton! I’m a big fan! Loading screen…

On the whole, though, Republic Commando is worth five bucks. Indeed, it’s worth ten. Is it worth the 50 bucks it was at launch? No. But if you’re a Star Wars fan who wants to drop a ten-spot and hit the wayback machine, take a look.
