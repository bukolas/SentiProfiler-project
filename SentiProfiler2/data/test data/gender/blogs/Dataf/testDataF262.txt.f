Jeannette Twomey, inventor of the Kind Reminder, sent me an email recently to tell me about her product. It's a little device that plays a recorded message with the push of a large button. The caregiver can leave a simple message like, "It's Tuesday and I'll see you at 5 p.m." or any information that the dementia patient may need to access frequently. The recorder is inexpensive and 5% of the purchase price goes to the Alzheimer's Association. If my dad was still alive, I'd have no problem shelling out $20 for this! Maybe if he had had a recording of my voice to carry around, he wouldn't have forgotten me.
