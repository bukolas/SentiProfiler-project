From China, Wei, 27, is a software programming student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and hopes to become a computer financial analyst. He is in Chicago on a student visa.

"There is a big future for financial programming," Wei said about his plans, sitting inside a modest Bridgeport apartment he shares with his wife and recently born son. "Not many people know how to do this work, or want to."

For Wei's 44-year-old half-brother, life in the U.S. has not been so bright.

Fleeing poverty, the brother arrived illegally from China nine years ago. After a harrowing trip orchestrated by "snakehead" smugglers, he has toiled 14-hour days for sub-minimum wages inside Chicago restaurants.

"His life here has been a kind of torture," Wei said.

Immigrant advocates hope Sunday's march will pressure President Barack Obama and federal lawmakers into taking up their demands for comprehensive reforms in the coming months. They argue that problems with the nation's immigration system have festered long enough -- with ongoing deportations hurting families and a booming black market in fake IDs threatening national security.

Groups in favor of tougher enforcement of immigration laws, meanwhile, have used the march plans to rally their supporters. Roy Beck, president of the Virginia-based NumbersUSA group, described Sunday's march as "the opening kickoff" in any renewed immigration debate in Washington.

On Thursday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., outlined a new bill that is the latest effort in a campaign for proposals that have been defeated twice in recent years.

Among other things, the new bill calls for biometric Social Security cards and for requiring illegal immigrants to pay fines and perform community service before they're allowed a chance at lawful permanent residency. Obama issued a statement on Thursday pledging to get such immigration legislation moving through Congress this year.

Immigrant advocates said they were encouraged by Obama's remarks, but express frustration that the president has not fulfilled a promise to act on immigration reform earlier.

"We need to see action," said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

John Darger said he has seen some of that anger in Crystal Lake, so he also plans to be on his way to Washington.

A teacher of English as a second language at McHenry County Community College, he cited stories from his Latino students about routine physical or verbal attacks, and resentful comments he's heard about newcomers from his neighbors. "The country needs to move beyond this divide," he said.

Up to 6,000 area residents left Saturday on the roughly 120 charted buses for Washington, at least half departing in a caravan from an evening rally outside U.S. Cellular Field. The turnout was the result of a weeks-long scramble for funds by immigrant activists and religious groups.

Marilyn Navarro, 16, raised the $183 it took to get a bus seat for herself and a 25-year-old cousin by putting out a donation jar inside her parents' Pilsen restaurant.

Navarro was inspired to go because her cousin arrived illegally with his parents as an 11-year-old. "It makes me so sad to know that there are millions of people out there like him," she said.
