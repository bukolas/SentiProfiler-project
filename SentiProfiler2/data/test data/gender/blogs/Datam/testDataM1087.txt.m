Well, I was gone and now I am back. I have been doing that a lot lately. Life has been busy and I am sure it has been that way with you guys too. Life is still the same out here other than being busier. Its still up in the air about custody of my son Ian but things seem to be going in my favor. The state, Department of Human Services, my lawyer, and Ian’s Lawyer are all recommending that he is placed permanently with me. Of course Chelseas lawyer is recommending he is returned to her. But that is what he is being paid to do. I am sure if he wasn’t he wouldn’t. She is still trying to tell everyone that I take my kids from their mothers just because I have all my kids.

Could she prove her stupidity any better?!? I got Matthew because his mother let her boyfriend beat on him like he is some kind of whipping boy. The state took him away from her and terminated her rights thinking I was dead because that’s what she told them. Only after I found out where my son was and proved that I was his father did the state give him to me. I got John when his mom was having some problems. Texas Child Protective Services placed him with me and his mom agreed with me is the best place for Little John. He is a daddies boy. From the day he was born he has been in his daddies arms. And I share custody of my son Brandon and my daughter Kailyn with their mom. So how in the hell do I take my kids from their mothers?!?

Sorry, I had to get that out of my system. Its been pissing me off.

Other than that things are still the same. No personal life to speak of (Dont blame them, what woman would want this kind of drama?), constantly working to improve the house, and tooling around the back roads in my car to relieve stress. I haven’t even had time to sit down and write anything.

But, the kids are getting bigger, Matts raised his grades significantly (Now I have to give back his ps2 and listen to that shit all day.), Kailyn is getting into more stuff than ever, and Brandons mom got him the worst haircut I have ever seen on the boy. He has a big head already and his mom got his hair cut waaaay to high and now he not only looks like he has a big head, but a fat one too. And she wont let me cut the rest of it off so it wont look so bad. But damn, it already looks bad! That’s it! That woman will not ever choose his haircuts again! Besides, the barber shop is a father/son thing. Beauty parlor my ass. The boy needs to start seeing a real barber. Maybe then they wont make him look like he has a fat head.

It seems like I have missed a lot on here but I see all the old wars are still going. All I can do is sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show. You could say something to the tards but it wouldn’t do any good, they will still be a tard tomorrow. At least it takes my mind off of all my crap. I can watch them and think,' My shit would be a whole lot worse if I was a dumb as them.' Thankfully there are a few of us that aren’t that stupid. 

Well, that what’s going on in my part of the world. While I am listening to my son rock out on guitar hero all friggin day why don’t you all drop me a comment letting me know how ya'll are doing?
