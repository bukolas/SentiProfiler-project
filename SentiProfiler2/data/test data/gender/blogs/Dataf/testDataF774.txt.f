To make the story short, I have been living on loans for the past 2.5 years while pursuing my midwifery education, scraping by. I had planned this trip at the end of my training, to cement all of my hours of studies and polish my skills before heading off into the land of the newly licensed and practicing home-birth midwife. Unfortunately due to the necessary end of my last relationship and the lies surrounding my gifted airline tickets for this trip never appearing, I had to reallocate the money I had set aside for lodging to purchase my ticket.
