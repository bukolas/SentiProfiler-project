For Christmas My Dad gave me some money so I bought a full size basketball net. I have been practising it nearly everyday and I can throw the ball a bit further now and more accurate. Next Topic is my hoodies, I always wear my hood for protection, (I feel safer when i wear it)apart from in shops where they will tell me to take it off again. So If people saw me in the street they would think Im a hoody who is going to get them but people who know me know different. I need to try and take off my hood more often. thanks for reading bye..
