My husband enjoys watching old government films for laughs. He's the kinda guy that trolls the Prelinger Archives for old gems (like "How to keep a job" -1949). Most of the films are pretty campy. Anyway, he told me about a government film about school lunch made in 1966 entitled "It happens every noon." There are so many things wrong about this film (too many to list) so please do not think I endorse anything related to this movie in terms of subject matter. That aside it did gave me some insight into the beginnings of National School Lunch program and what students ate in the 1960's. Sadly it looks like school lunches have gone downhill in the past 40 years.
