On 5 September history was made by 7 Ministers of Health from low-income countries together with serious politicians from West Europe and representatives from aid organisations that had learnt their lessons . The group launched the International Health Partnership. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/ihp/default.asp If aid from rich countries should effectively improve health of the poor, they said, the aid must be: 1. coordinated, 2. foucsed on improving health systems as a whole instead of one disease at a time, 3. and part of good national plans. These statements are evidance based, much needed but "un-sexy". So let me translate the 3 statements into blunt words: 1. It is mad that Ministries of Health in low-income countries each week must meet a growing number of aid delegations. 2. It is cruel to tell millions of poor mothers; "your child is dying from pneumonia for which our clinic have no drugs because Bush, Blair and rich activits did not know that pneumonia and diarrhea kill as many as do malaria, TB and HIV. 3. It is stupid to fund seprate clinics for each disease when there is not even staff and money e nough for one clinic in each village. So, 5 September 2007, is a happy day for global health. Fragmented health aid based on what is "sexy" in the media of the rish will be replaced by health aid focusing on what is needed in the clinic of the poor. Why is Sweden not yet part of the International Health Partnership? The Swedish Minister for Development Aid recently wisely focused Swedish bilateral aid too fewer countries. So hopefully she will soon join the Partnership of the wise. In these issues it seems more important if politicians are wise than if they come from left or right, so we can hope that Sweden will join. This vlog uses a flash presentation that Gapminder did with Trendalyzer graphics. It shows the development of Sweden during the last 300 years. It is my first attempt to use chroma key video with animated statistics as done daily with weather forcasts in TV. Following my talk in Swedish radio news on how to avaoid child deaths in pneumonia I get requests on where to donate. What is needed is steady funding over many year so that poor families get access to diagnosis and antibiotics. I judge that UNICEF is most competent to provide long-term support for child survival. The reason is good track record, that the present Director Ann Veneman understands how health service system in low income countries need long term support and that UNICEF base their policy on best available research. To save children now donate to http://www.unicef.se/stod_oss/ge_en_gava_har/ if not in Sweden look up UNICEF in your country. To support research for better care for infections of the poor donate to World Infections Fund http://www.vif.se/mallar/donatewwallit.aspx?SidID=10186 . Keep donating regularly to a good cause, and learn about progress and challanges. The underfunded needs are the continious majora challanges for poor families; pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, education and the daily bread, i.e. agriculture in rula areas and job in urban areas. Water and sanitation also get less attention than emergency relief and HIV; the two worthy causes that presently receives almost sufficient funding. Cotton farmers in Texas earn their wealth from Soviet-like government subsidies. The annual 4 billion US dollar tax subsides to 25 000 US cotton farmers are of concern for global health! The reason being that this obstacle to free trade kill so many children. 1. Subsidies hamper economic growth in cotton producing west African countries. This keeps millions of hardworking farmers in poverty and hinder them to care well for their children. http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp30_cotton.htm 2. If only parts of the 4 tax billions were re-directed tovAnn Venneman at UNICEF, she can avoid 600,000 child deaths from pneumonia by using 0.6 billion USD to provide care and antibiotics. http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index_35937.html 3. The soviet cotton economy of Texas is a major obstacle for successful agreements on free world trade. And a fair global trade system will save thelives of so many children’s . http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl57_e.htm The world is waiting for a US president with the guts to implement a cotton Perestroika in Texas! On January 27 at the World Economic Forum in Davos I asked Bill Gates for help. Help to speed up provision of courses on Global Health at universities around the world. I gave him a copy of our Textbook on Global Health (see below). He rightly noted that it was the first of its kind and that fact based overviews of the global health situations are badly needed. On February 7 I got this note from our publisher Studentlitteratur: "Här kommer lite glada nyheter om Global Health. Dessutom har Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation köpt 200 ex som deras personal ska läsa!" Gates Foundation had bought 200 copies, one each for the staff! Is it possible to write a book on the health of all 6.5 billion persons living on the globe? Well we did it and now it is on sale from Monday 27/11 2006. We are six authors, but it was Ann Lindstrand who got it together and Birgitta Rubensson that brought it to print. Hundreds of students read and commented various versions. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b/203-2244500-9311121?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=rosling We wrote it for those that in a short text want to learn: -how the health of the world's population has changed over time; -how the main determinants of health varied with time and place; -how health can be measured; about the causes of the main diseases in the world; -what health care that exist around the world. Our book is a summary of the works by greater scholars on global health. The pros with our book are the overviews; the cons are the simplifications and errors that are a consequence of our broad ambitions. Yesterday UNAIDS declared: " the global AIDS epidemic continuous to grow... an estimated 40 millions are living with HIV... the number with HIV has increased from 37 millions in 2004. www.unaids.org But on the AIDS day in 2004 the message from UNAIDS was that "over 41 million people are living with HIV/AIDS" http://www.un.org/events/aids/2004/ Are UNAIDS lying? No, it is led by honest and good scientists, so how come? If you dig further into the data you find that the uncertainty range of UNAIDS estimates are wide: - somewhere between 32 to 44 millions lived with HIV in 2004 and today somewhere between 34 to 47 millions. So the true number may be slowly falling. A reasonable conclusion is that the number of HIV infected in the world remains the same over the last years. But telling that may put funding for much needed HIV/AIDS control at risk, so its better to conclude that the epidemic continuous to grow. UNAIDS may be excused for drawing the scary conclusion that the epidemic is still increasing, because they simultaneously communicate that there are solid evidence that the epidemic is decreasing in more and more countries. The exclusive focus on treatment may have delayed the decrease. Best available assessment indicate that money is best used on scaling up prevention http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5766/1474 But international support to prevention tends to focus on the moral of the donor rather than the effectiveness of the action. The present US administration likes to fund "less sex" and Sweden likes to fund "more condoms". Evidence from Zimbabwe tells that both works. Later sex debut and fewer partners may even be more important than more condom use http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5761/664
