I have had CTS for 15 years and it is often aggravated by yard work (rake & shovel are worst) more than computer work, even though I work on a keyboard all day. After a hard day of work in the yard I find that icing the top & bottom of my wrists for about 45 mins per side can really help. I keep the ice on one spot for 10-15 mins, then move it to the other side of the same wrist, and repeat until the 45 mins are up. Then I'll do the other hand/wrist. I do the icing routine right after I finish in the yard, and then again the next morning when I get up. All that being said, I am getting close to the point of being unable to keep the CTS at bay through reducing yard work and icing. Steroid shots in the wrist broke a couple of really bad cycles for me as well, but I am close to taking the advice from my friends who've had the surgery and are now symptom-less, and just getting the thing done...
