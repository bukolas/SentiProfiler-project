This may sound silly, but when was the last time you looked in the mirror at yourself and said, “I love you.”

What is mirror work?   It’s when you face yourself in the mirror, look into your eyes, and say affirmations to yourself.

Louise Hay, in “You Can Heal Your Life,” clearly describes this simple process.   She helps you gain back your personal power by looking in the mirror and saying “I Love You (put in your name).”   This simple affirmation can have profound affect on your well-being.   ’m sitting on the bus writing, my words barely legible from the jerky motion as the bus travels over the New York City roads.  I have an hour-long trip each way into the City (at least) and I do use this time to do many things.  I catch up with emails on my blackberry, read and even talk on the phone (which is somewhat rude when the bus is quiet and people are relaxing).  

Yet, this is a prime time to write.    I’m constantly saying I want time to write…here it is. 
Today is Valentine’s Day and immediately I thought of people I love.   How can I let them know they are important and special in my life?   Then I thought, “what about me?”  How do I show myself that I love “me” and I’m special in my life?

What flashed in my mind immediately is that I’m tolerating too much in my life.   How do I know that I’m tolerating “stuff?” I can tell by listening to my internal thoughts of frustrations or the complaints that I express to others.
