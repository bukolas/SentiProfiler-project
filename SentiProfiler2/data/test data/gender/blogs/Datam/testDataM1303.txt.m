I have started going to School 3 days a week for about 3 hours now. I am now 17 years old. People say I have got better at speaking to people but I dont think so, I still get as nervous maybe even more. My Brother Adam now takes me out 3 times a week now for a couple of hours so im a lot busier than before. If youn want any advice or anything about Autism comment if you want. Once Someone called me a professional about autism but im not, I will still try to help if i can.
