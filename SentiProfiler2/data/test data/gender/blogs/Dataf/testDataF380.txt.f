In 1926 the parish church of Sahuayo was the second place attacked by Federal soldiers. After the end of the religious conflict and during Lazaro Cardenas governorship of Michoacan the lands of the Hacienda de Guaracho were shared between the farmers of Sahuayo. On 28th November 1952, due to its economic development Sahuayo was granted city status and then in 1957 the city once again changed its name to Sahuayo de Jose Maria Morellos in honour of one of the revolutionary leaders in the War of Independance.
