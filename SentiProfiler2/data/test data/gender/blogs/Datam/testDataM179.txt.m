When Peter O’Hanlon opened the Blarney Bar in downtown Jamaica, Queens in 1965, he served a mostly white clientele, including the union leaders and members who held their meetings in the back room.

Now, the clientele is largely black, with an increasing number of Ecuadoreans, a growing local population. Mr. O’Hanlon tends bar and is often the only white man in the place these days.

“If an Irishman comes in now, we treat them with kid gloves because we don’t see them very often,” said Mr. O’Hanlon, 73, who nevertheless has decked out the place in green for St. Patrick’s Day.

Change in New York City can be seen through many different prisms, and if your prism is a pub window, or perhaps the bottom of a pint glass, you can see old New York meeting the new in Irish bars in neighborhoods that are no longer Irish.

As Irish populations in saloon-heavy areas have given way to more recent waves of immigrants, a few Irish bars remain, looking a bit incongruous with their green awnings, lilting names and shamrock neon signs in the windows.

Some hang on as the last strongholds of the old Irish guard, like Paradise Alley, a bar surrounded by Korean businesses on 150th Street in downtown Flushing. Here the old-timers of Irish and German descent hold on to their pint glasses and wonder what happened to the old neighborhood. Still, they may buy a drink for the occasional Korean couple who come in.
