my handspun yarn: madder, weld, walnut, camomile In recent years spinning (with a hand spindle) is something I've enjoyed during Winter evenings, but this past Winter I looked at the spindle and the wool and just did not feel motivated. Some Winters are like that for me. I get tired easily because of the lack of sunshine. Then recently I began to think again about all the wool I have stored, some dyed and some undyed, and felt inspired. So, this time around I am spinning for Spring, and so am working toward a Spring project. At the moment I'm dyeing and spinning and then will begin to knit some kind of simple scarf-throw project. I'll begin the knitting on the Spring Equinox, the day I consider to be that all important 'first day of' - so that's this Saturday. I'll knit and continue to dye wool and spin, and will work through April, hoping to complete sometime in early May. But there's no rush. This is a project for myself, something to enjoy in the evenings now the days feel longer. The wool used is a mix of British breeds: Shetland, Shropshire and Falklands, and some merino I have had for a while. Mostly these days if I buy wool tops to dye/spin it will be from a supplier who sells rare British breeds because I find that more interesting to use. I'll hope to share the project as it moves along - in simple stripes of natural colours. I am not a very adept knitter, I like to keep it simple and can't be asked to follow knitting pattern instructions! I'll be knitting the singles rather than plyed wool because I find I can spin quite balanced singles and they knit up quite pleasantly enough. I'm dyeing the wool using mostly my tried and tested solar jar method. For dyes such as weld, I am cooking up the dried dyestuff and then straining the dye solution, pouring it into a jar to use. Some dyes, such as madder, will work well if put into the jar and covered with hot water from the kettle, but weld and alkanet for another example are dyestuffs that from my experience need a little more persuasion. I really like the yellows of weld on wool, and yellows will be the main hue for this Spring project. As a brief follow-on from yesterday's post, examples of handwriting using the same monoprint method. Yes you do need to write in mirror style. So I am constantly telling myself: b is d and d is b...... These will become something more in the near future. Thank you very much for all your comments re: yesterdays monoprint drawing post. I'm pleased you found it interesting. A drawing and its inky shadow.... the various attempts I made, working toward the one drawing I decided to use. I had the idea of a figure seated on a chair, a shape of a figure rather than a detailed human person. But the figure wears shoes. And the chair, because chairs are one of my 'things', had to be just a very simple form. The figures are all rather bizarre because I drew with my eyes closed. Yes, I do like a challenge.... but I knew this was the way for me to get the result I had in mind.... Above are photos I took whilst working on drawings for my latest zine 'dreamers' (still a few copies available in my shop ). Today (no mosaic this Monday, next week) - I thought I would finally write about my own approach to making monoprint drawings. I've written before, but several people have asked me to explain a little about how etc.. and I'm happy to put this post together, as my own technique and approach changes over time. Making these drawings does not require a printers press or any other specialist equipment. I like to make things that require the most basic of things: needle and thread, paper and pencil, and for monoprint drawing: ink/paint, glass, paper, drawing tool. I use a sheet of glass from an old picture frame. I use either printers ink (the type you might use for lino) or water-mixable oil paint. In recent times I have preferred the latter as I like the thickness and texture of the paint, it has a slow drying time and allows a variety of results: from very inky and dark, to cloudy, to light and fine lines. The paint/ink is spread across the glass quite evenly and if you prefer you can use a roller, but I use my fingers because I like the slight uneven and fingerprinty result. When I am making monoprint drawings I am working toward an expressive image, perhaps primitive, minimalist even. There are some drawings that are more elaborate but mostly I'm not aiming toward the fine exactness of an etching, for example. I'm happy to play with chance. My drawings with pencil are very different. When I draw in my sketchbook (see sketchbook sundays posts for examples), I use the eraser as a tool for both editing and blending. And I will make many adjustments sometimes before I get a pencil drawing just so. With monoprint drawing there is no rubbing out and editing a certain area, though you can work with 'mistakes' and go with the flow. A sheet of paper is placed over the inked glass and then you draw. Once you have finished drawing, you flip over the paper and there is your monoprinted image. I draw with a long darning needle. So when I am drawing I am just denting gently into the paper and not making any easily seen impression. I have to work in good light so that I can see the finely dented lines. Or I can take advantage of not seeing my drawing and can work 'blind', which offers interesting results too. Either way, I have to be careful not to lean on the paper too much, although a few inky smudges made my fingers holding the paper in place are quite acceptable and desirable for me. It's all about finding your own style and technique of working, of course. I'm showing many examples here but urge anyone who wishes to try monoprint drawing to draw in their own way and to learn through experience, which does take paper and time. Finding your own way of making marks is that big leap toward feeling like you are making something that is truly your own. I can get inspired by other artists, of course, but return again and again to my own obsessions..... Here's an example of quite a tiny drawing - showing you the inked glass image too. You can see here there is a modest about of paint smeared across the glass. This drawing was made after several previous drawings. Here's the first drawing I made during a brief session this morning. I had prepared the glass and left it a short while to allow the water-based oil paint to dry just a little. I thought I would work on a simple series of drawings to demonstrate - so chose one of my 'things' - long-eared things, rabbits and hares.... I made a series of little quirky rabbit drawings. Because my inked glass was smaller than the paper area, I lifted and shifted the paper, so that's why the glass does not match up with the drawing! I attempted to draw a girl holding a rabbit. Wishing to aim for a quite primitive drawing. You can see my attempts starting left to right. I like the first drawing best - because it features an echo of a previous drawing left in the ink, and because I like the really smudgy drawings. Shadow girl and rabbit Various drawings showing the different quality of line achieved in one drawing session. Here you can see my first drawing in the centre and then as I continued to draw so I switched paper to a smoother cartridge paper that is best for showing fine line. Further tips: experiment with using different inks, paints and colours. Do not limit yourself to one type of paper. I also try and use old envelopes, fabric, tissue paper etc.... If you are wishing to try this with young children or less able folk, and would prefer not to use glass - then try very glossy paper or plastic folders. Just smear the paint/ink across very thinly and experiment. I've made drawings in the past using the cover of an old magazine as my 'glass'. You can also use perspex of course. Instead of drawing with a needle as I do, other drawing tools to use are of course etching tools, pointed tips of ceramics tools, sharpened pencils, cocktail sticks. I hope this post has been both insightful and interesting to you. This week I am very busy working toward many new things for my shop update on the 24th. I'm also dyeing lots of wool for a particular project but I'll write about that tomorrow. Have a happy Monday x This last one is still in progress. It is in my new A3 size moleskine - so much bigger. This book will be a challenge for me. I've still quite a lot of work to do on this one, I feel, but have taken a shot just to record where I am at today. You never know, this one might change quite radically or may wait a while before I work on it some more. I've also been writing notes toward new poems. And spinning dyed wool to knit a Spring throw. I'll share more of this project next week. It has been Mothering Sunday in the UK today. A lovely Spring day. I hope you had a good one. A 'yesterdays' in grey and gold.... I wanted to make a more elaborate doll - with ruffles. Her skirt is edged with vintage velvet ribbon. She is a 'salon couture ruffles' kind of girl. Thank you for your kind comments/feedback re: my zine! I am pleased to know those who have received (UK people mostly of course) are enjoying this one. This helps me to know, cheers me as I continue to think on new ideas for both drawing and poetry. I wish you a very good weekend x A drawing from my sketchbook printed on to cotton and made into a small pillow. The pillow measures 5 inches tall and is filled with a mix of lavender with polyester stuffing. The reverse side is grey cotton (hand dyed with alkanet). I love lavender and lavender pillows. They can come in so many shapes and sizes. I've also sewn, for myself, a very simple linen dyed with alkanet pillow. I just like things very simple, some times. And as much as I love spring colours, I'm also in love with grey all year round. Perhaps this is why I like pencil drawings, pebbles, grey foliage plants, grey dresses and grey rabbits. 1. winter into spring , 2. Untitled , 3. day 64 , 4. mulberry eye , 5.

Untitled Created with fd's Flickr Toys A bright, frosty start to the week here! Many thanks to the artists and photographers featured here for sharing their work via my Flickr contacts. I've chosen a gentle selection, letting in the light and shade of Spring.... it really does, finally, feel as if we are moving toward the next brighter season here. Just a few flowers can make such a big difference. This week I've plenty to do, as always. I've got packages to send out following my shop update (thank you). There are still a few copies of my zine available. My next update will be in a few weeks time. I'll put the date here on the blog when it is decided. There will be more yesterdays! I only had a few in last Friday's selection - I shall offer a few more next time, as I do get requests and thanks. Also, my natural dyed fabrics are currently 'coming soon' in the shop. This means I am busy dyeing new new new - and by the end of this week I hope to have enough stock to make available again. Thanks for your interest. I'm enjoying my recent drawing and writing notes toward new poems. I've not updated nevering for a while. This is because I am working toward new poems for a collection - this takes time and there is a slow brew of ideas coming..... Spring usually brings a new energy to my writing. As I watch the birds and the sun lengthens the day, so my notebooks might get a little more inspired. It is paying attention to the small details of the day and adding these together, making something a little magical from the mix.... There are a few collaborative projects I am working on and I'll share more about them soon. Looking ahead to April already, I am thinking of doing some kind of month-long project. Perhaps like my November painted book. But I am still thinking on..... I hope you have a very good week and more soon x new sketches in my small moleskine sketchbook This weekend I spent some time in the garden tidying, seeing the bulbs I planted last Autumn making their way through. Lovely.... But it was cold so I worked quickly and took tea breaks, and sketched..... enjoy the rest of your Sunday
