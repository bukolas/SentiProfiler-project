<body>
<p>This package is used to add Unicode handling capabilities (the ability to accept input in any of the supported languages) to any Java application.
It has been first designed as part of the <a href="http://www.gate.ac.uk">GATE 2</a> project and the name GUK stands for "Gate Unicode Kit". GUK does not depend on any GATE classes and can be used independently of GATE as a separate library.</p>
The {@link guk.Editor} class provides a simple Unicode enabled text editor.

<h3><a name="install">Installing GUK</a></h3>
GUK needs to be installed as an <i>instaled JVM extension</i> (a jar in the &lt;path to jdk&gt;/jre/lib/ext directory).

<h4>Handling input</h4>
The user (programmer in this case) doesn't need to do anything special to take advantage of the <i>Gate input method</i> which allows Unicode input. All that is needed is proper installation of the package as an "Installed JVM extension". (see <a href="#install">installation</a> above).
When GUK is properly installed any Java application run in that JVM should have an additional sub-menu in the system menu (the one started by clicking the application's icon, usually in the top left corner of the window) saying "Select Input Method". The functionality of the <i>Gate Input Method</i> is available through that menu.
The only useful option that is only available through and API is the choice of displaying or not the virtual keyboard map (see {@link guk.im.GateIM#setMapVisible(boolean)}).
