Outfitted with burly outsoles, waterproof materials, and big toe guards, trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature. As the following reviews indicate, not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing. Some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs. Others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain. To determine how they measure up, we analyzed each shoe at the RW Shoe Lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners. We found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails. WE SAY This is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud, thanks to its deep lugs. It also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill. RW Shoe Lab tests show the shoe's heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide. All this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground. Recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don't want to sacrifice off-road traction.
