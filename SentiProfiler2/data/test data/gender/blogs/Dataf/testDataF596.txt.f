I attended this wedding created by the beautiful and talented bride and surrounded by her very generous and creative family. Never have I seen a more beautiful wedding, let alone attended one. It was an honour to be there. We found ourselves breathless at the beauty of it. I spent the weekend in Mudgee (c ountry NSW) a land of rolling green hills wearing uniforms of vines and trees of olives backed by rugged mountains. We finally stopped for lunch after getting lost in the rain for an hour trying to find the restaurant (which funnily enough is named Solitary) because we packed and took off without a single map or address. Plain arrogance I think it was. There we were, thinking we were going to quiet country towns and assuming the places we were headed should be obvious because, well, surely there was little else around. Wrong on the lunch front and wrong again when we tried to find the guest house. We did our research on the scene of the ceremony though because we didn't want to miss a minute - when I show you the wedding, you'll understand why. I have been meaning to tell you how flattered I was when my heavy headed rose postcards (hanging in the top right hand corner) were featured in a beautiful NZ magazine in their Feb/Mar 10 issue which came out on Australia Day featuring these sweet Valentines Day gift ideas. I tend to like the behind the scenes bits best. The part when it all comes together and there are no people there to add unwanted colours and mess to the vision. Just artisans - florists, cake decorators, event designers - working as a team. The only guests pre-party are lovers of colour and create-as-you-go constructionists, and hopefully some strong men to help carry the 'stuff'. Stunning board by super talented Elena .

Sugarcoated created the most amazing wedding. Watch their blog over the next few weeks for all the stunning details.
