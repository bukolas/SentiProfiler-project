Reservation Policy and Politics - "Reservation on any cast, clan or sex is undemocratic and leads to inefficiency and second -rate standards". This is the line given by our first prime minister late Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru.It was told when India became independent. At the same time 1948-1949, the father of constitution Dr B.R Ambedkar had a note of caution for future governments that large scale quotas could destroy the rule of equality of opportunity.He revealed that reservation quotas should be consistent with the constitution and must be confined to minority of seats. But do you think that this line is consistent in today's scenario?
DEFINITELY NOT !!!!!! :(
Lets start from the beginning of the Indian civilization. Earlier the Hindu SAMAJ was divided into four major classes (earlier called "verna") namely Brahmins,Kshytriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras. Brahmins were at the top of the varna hierarchy, Kshytriys were the second , third were the Vaisys and Sudras(the untouchables). The cast was decided on the basis of occupation. At that time Sudras were not permitted to visit place like temple etc. This was the time which lead to the concept of reservation. Because at that time if the society would have not been divided, it would be impossible to think a word like "RESERVATION".
Reservation in favour of Backward Class was introduced in many states such as Maharastra etc in many fields.In 1902 Maharastra introduced reservation to eradicate poverty amongst minority groups and to give their share in state administration.The notification of 1902 gave 50% reservation in service for backward classes.After that it became a trend, which is an older one but a big hit for collecting votes and publicity in a short period of time. Scheduled Caste (SC) and Tribes (ST) constitute approximately 22% of the country's population. Accordingly a reservation of 22.5% has been made for them in educational institution which come under the control of MHRD and other central ministries. Similar reservations, proportional to their population, have also been provided by the state governments and union territory administrations. SC and ST students are also entertained a relaxation with respect to their upper age limit as well as concession of lower cut-off qualifying marks.Besides reservation for SC and ST candidates,reservation is also provided for other categories of backward classes (OBC). In 1978 the second backward classes commission under the chairmanship of B.P Mandal was set up.The commission, which submitted its report in 1980 and recommended the reservation of 27% of the seats in all scientific, technical and professional institutions run by the central as well as state governments for OBCs. It further recommended that those States which have already
reserved more than 27% seats for OBC students would remain unaffected by this recommendation. The Government of India implemented the recommendations in 1990 leading to violent protests. Besides caste based reservations, there are also varieties of reservation and quota system, for example, Non-resident Indians (5%), Women (30%), Physically handicapped,
Migrants from J & K, NCC Quota, Sports Quota,Anglo-Indian Community, Children of Political Sufferers, Children of Defence personnel, Children of Ex servicemen, Government of India Nominees. The supreme court had earlier ruled that the total percentage of reservation should not exceed 50%, but also inserted an economic clause in the name of what is called "creamy layer".Now this word has become a headache for the government, in the sense of its definition. The norms which should be full filled for the status of creamy layer is still a matter of debate.Later, reservation were introduce for other sections as well. The supreme court ruling that reservations can not exceed 50% has put a cap on reservations. However there are states laws that exceed this 50% limit and these are under litigation in the supreme court.For example the caste based reservation is about 70% in Tamil Nadu. The reservation in Tamil Nadu is much with respect to other part of India.When the first reservation protest hit New Delhi in May 2006, the people of Tamil Nadu were pleading to implement it in the state. When students and doctors in Delhi were agitating by hunger strike and facing water cannon, students and doctors in Tamil Nadu were demanding reservation. Doctors in Chennai ,including Indian Association members, were in the forefront expressing their support for reservation in institutions of higher education run by the central government.Bihar is also not far behind in this prospect(the government of Bihar had given 50% reservation in public sector job for women).

The political issue of reservation in education institution is so important, fundamental and explosive that every time it comes up for debate politicians get into their act. Human resource development minister Arjun singh proposed the bill for 27% of reservation to OBC in 2005.When the bill for reservation (OBC) was presented in the parliament it got about 95% votes in favour. Hence Arjun Singh was successful in alluring a large population in form of OBC.The BJP can't digest such a huge amount of the vote is going Congress' way. It somewhat convincingly asked why minority-managed (meaning Christian and Muslim institutions) are not included in the amendment (such colleges and institutions were not included for reservation). Answering to this question HRD minister Arjun Singh could not hide hide his happiness when he replied to the opposition why minority institutions cannot be included. After that the BJP tried to take advantage by introducing a bill to get Muslim and Christian institutions under the bill proposed for OBC. But the bill was not passed because it lost by a large margin(got only 25% vote in favour).Now after the implementation of these reservation and relaxations the minorities establish and administer educational institutions are becoming so commercial that poor and backward students are not able to afford the fee.Due to this reason in Andhra pradesh alone about 10000 engineering seats were not filled up last year because they could not find students who can pay for those seats.So again its a matter of debate that even after 50% reservation poor students are not able to get a seat in college.

How ever , reservation continues to be a controversial social and political issue and has resulted many protracted legal disputes.Apart form all this, there is not even a single organisation who is working for eradication of reservation. If it continues in the same way then a day will come when every body will be trying to get certificate for SC ,ST or OBC status.Which has already started in the form of "GUJJAR AANDOLAN".
