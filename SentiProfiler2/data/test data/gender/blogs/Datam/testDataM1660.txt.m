Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn't get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird.
