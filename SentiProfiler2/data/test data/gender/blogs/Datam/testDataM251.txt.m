England manager Martin Johnson went on to the pitch at the final whistle to question Lawrence about his control of the scrums. “I was just asking him for clarification that’s all,” Johnson said.

“At scrum time he was very quick to penalise, which is fine if we were wrong. But I said that he had to penalise them first time as well. One scrum was reset and then they kicked three points just before half-time and I asked him why he didn’t penalise them as well.

"It doesn’t matter what I think about his performance. He refs the game so his decision is final and that’s fine.” But Lewis Moody, who captained England for the first time in the absence of the injured Steve Borthwick, refused to blame Lawrence.

“There’s no point blaming the referee, it’s our game to win, not his. We have just got to be more clinical,” Moody said.

Ireland’s defeat in their last game at Croke Park before they return to the redeveloped Lansdowne Road ended their slim title hopes and cost them their fifth Triple Crown in seven seasons.

A last-minute penalty from fly-half Dan Parks saved Scotland from the wooden spoon and clinched their first win in Dublin since 1998. Italy, beaten 33-10 by Wales at the Millennium Stadium, propped up the table for the third successive season.

“We came here to spoil the party and we sort of did that. We are delighted,” Parks said.

Scotland’s win was their first in the Six Nations under former England head coach Andy Robinson after near misses against Wales and Italy.

Wales had to settle for fourth place two years after they completed the Grand Slam.
