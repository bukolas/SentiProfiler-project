So thank God I'm still in training cause I was scheduled for a shift from 12PM-11PM today and I would've missed three of my four classes. O_O I left Psychology at 6:40PM and drove to work. I had the same trainer tonight as I did the first day (Katherine), but today we followed a different doctor.

As soon as walk through those double doors, we go to an exam room where a middle-aged man is complaining about an abscess on his butt. Needless to say, he removes his pants and there it was. Not only is there an abscess, but there a massive amount of scar tissue from previous incidents. I guess they didn't go as well. Yikes. It was like the cheeks were abused with a meat tenderizer or something. It was graphic and yet that's not the worst part. The doctor unpacked a bandage from the abscess and pulled out a gauze plug the length of, let's say...a foot long. I was like, "Oh, wow. That's impressive." The doctor replies, "Oh, this is shorter than most packs." Just imagine the long bloody, pus-lined gauze strip coming out of an abscess on the butt-cheek. Yep, that's a keeper. Then, he proceeds to drain the pus out of it. Mmm...just dandy. :-D

Let's move on to a lighter note, shall we? There was a 5-yr. old that came in because he has a "big boo-boo on da fingor" as he had put it. Lol. I love kids. It was actually an infected area where he had gotten a finger prick a couple days before. A red blister had swollen up and collected some pus at the head. Your body loooves to produce pus when an infection occurs. It's just its way of saying, "Here's a lovely reminder that this needs to get checked out." :-D Anyway, the doctor orders a drainage to be done and we retrieve some supplies to do that. We also get another assistant to come in and help restrain the child as we do the procedure. You know kids, screaming and kicking and such. Funny thing is, the whole thing is going absolutely fine when the kid's finger is being washed and numbed. It's only when he sees the doctor pull out the needle to prick the head of the abscess in which the kid proceeds to scream at the top of his fucking lungs. Literally, the puncture takes a fraction of a second and the doctor tells him he's done. Tears were streaming down his face and he immediately shuts up. We give him some Neosporin on the finger and a band-aid and a freakin' cherry popsicle. Yes, a cherry popsicle.

So that was my second night on the job, albeit I was really only there for half the shift. Lol. Only two days have gone by and I've seen the craziest things and they're only to get crazier. Stay tuned, readers of interest. :-D
