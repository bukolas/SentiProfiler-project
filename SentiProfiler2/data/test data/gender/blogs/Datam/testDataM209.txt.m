Anyone here interested about Warhammer games? I am not a huge Warhammer fan more like Warcraft, Age of empire enthusiast when it comes to RTS games. But i have to agree i enjoyed Warhammer 40k games. The online reason now i am downloading the beta cause i read GameInformer( June 08 ) article on this game and several gameplay features made me a future fan. I want to add some quote from GI - "...the focus has shifted toward encouraging players to taka part in large public PvP areas that can be found in nearly every zone." Check the IGNs beta preview if you want to learn more about the almost finished game. http://pc.ign.com/articles/906/906266p2.htmlFrom the sceenshots and gameplay video game is looking exceptionally polished and ready to go. I am hoping to post another blog after playing the game for several hours. i never played World of warcraft and only MMORPG i played for over 100 hours is Dungeon Runners. i never like the monthly subscription fee that is $15, warhammer will have same kinda fee, so i am sure i am not going to play the full game even if i like the game, in my opinion online game should follow the fps game rule like Team Fortress, Call of Duty, where you buy a game and play as long as you wish without paying extra money.if you are wondering from where i am downloading the beta, the answer is on the image above - Fileplanet. From their site beta will be playable from September 7th so i am going to play that game 12 days before most the gamers and also i don't have to pay a dime. It will take some time to finish the downloading - it's almost 10 GB (9.38 exactly). According to the official site so far almost 900K people applied for beta participation, not bad for game that is not related with WOW.
