Twas the Irish what invented the pipes, you know, and they gave them to the Scots as a joke. And the Scots haven't gotten the joke yet! Chocolate Guinness Cake by Nigella Lawson This cake is magnificent in its damp blackness. I can't say that you can absolutely taste the stout in it, but there is certainly a resonant, ferrous tang which I happen to love. The best way of describing it is to say that it's like gingerbread without the spices. There is enough sugar — a certain understatement here — to counter any potential bitterness of the Guinness, and although I've eaten versions of this made up like a chocolate layer cake, stuffed and slathered in a rich chocolate frosting, I think that can take away from its dark majesty. Besides, I wanted to make a cream cheese frosting to echo the pale head that sits on top of a glass of stout. It's unconventional to add cream but it makes it frothier and lighter which I regard as aesthetically and gastronomically desirable. But it is perfectly acceptable to leave the cake un-iced: in fact, it tastes gorgeous plain. Ingredients for the cake: 1 cup Guinness 1 stick plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa 2 cups superfine sugar 3/4 cup sour cream 2 eggs 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda Ingredients for the topping: 8 oz Philadelphia cream cheese 1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 1/2 cup heavy cream Nigella's Suggestions: For a simpler dessert, replace the frosting with a light dusting of powered sugar. Preheat the over to 350 F, and butter and line a 9 inch springform pan. Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan, add the butter — in spoons or slices — and heat until the butter's melted, at which time you should whisk in the cocoa and sugar. Beat the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla and then pour into the brown, buttery, beery pan and finally whisk in the flour and baking soda. Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined pan and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the pan on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake. When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the frosting. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sift over the confectioner's sugar and then beat them both together. Or do this in a processor, putting the unsifted confectioners' sugar in first and blitz to remove lumps before adding the cheese. Add the cream and beat again until it makes a spreadable consistency. Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint. This PDF, regarding album covers, was sent to me by Michael De Jong, it's both funny and disturbing at the same time. He's a singer/songwriter, entertainer and friend whom I used to play with in the '70's. He's now living in Amsterdam and still playing internationally. If you're interested in finding out more about him, go to his "Hyves"site &lt; http://singermichael.hyves.nl/ &gt; (best) or his website &lt; www.michaeldejong.org &gt; (older - first effort) Anyway, sure hope I can figure out how to attach this PDF here. Otherwise, I'll ask Diane if she will help. (Vincent Price in The Fly, "Help me".) Hmm. Having just exhausted my store (one shelf with a few odds and ends) of knowledge, I'll defer to the experts. Double hmm. I think I want to change from my Nom D'Blog, Myron J. Poltroonian, to me - John Besharian. Guess I'll have a lot o' askin' t'do. If there's a "Wingding" this summer, I'll look forward to seeing everyone there.
