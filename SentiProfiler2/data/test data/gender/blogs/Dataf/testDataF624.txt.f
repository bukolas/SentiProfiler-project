Kiwi sullo stecco , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . With Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign to promote a healthier way of nourishing our kids, it almost looks as if McDonald's in Italy has taken a step forward and jumped on the health wagon too. How about kiwi on a stick? Not such a terrible idea right? Individually wrapped kiwi sullo stecco (not the one shown here, that was my idea) will be available from March 9th to May 24th at the cost of 1€ each. I already pride myself in eating 5 or more servings of fresh fruit and vegetables each day - the habit sort of stuck after seeing how my inlaws serve a big bowl of fruit after the Sunday meal. All that snow last Wednesday? Pfffffft! Gone in 2 days like some flailing lightweight when the sun blew into town. By Friday it was a definite go for spring hiking conditions anywhere on a south-facing trail, and this is a fairly easy one (ascent of 317 meters) that I suggest if you're not afraid of the woods. I felt as if someone was watching me... All kidding aside, there is, or there should be, an area along the path where carved wooden creatures exist in il Sentiero dello Spirito del Bosco (the path of the spirit of the woods). Well, not that I was expecting an Ent-like entity to walk up and start shaking my hand or anything, but we didn't see friendly tree people and probably walked right past in our quest to reach that steaming bowl of polenta and cheese at the end of the road. I suspect that if we had explored the large picnic area at the first stop/info point, this guy with the owl may have willingly posed for my lens.

Upon reaching Canzo, look for the "P" on brown street signs to Gajum - ample parking where via Rimembranze and via Gasperi intersect at the cemetary. From there it's only about a 20-minute walk on paved road (uphill of course!) with easy-to-spot GAJUM signs pointing the way. I imagine that this trail is quite popular with families, hikers with dogs, and nature lovers of all ages, thus the need to restrict traffic on weekends when everyone escapes to the mountains to let loose in the woods. To Rifugio Terz'Alpe This can be enjoyed as a loop trail - percorso ad anello - tackling thigh-busting Via Per le Alpi on the left and returning by way of Via San Miro. The path initially zigzags through peaceful forest on sun-dappled stones, arriving at the first rest point/info center (40 minutes) where I missed seeing the wood sculptures. From this point, Rifugio Terze'Alpe is a half hour away on flat terrain. The return on via San Miro takes about 45 minutes. The food There is nothing like a rustic, hearty meal of polenta taragna (corn and buckwheat polenta), pizzoccheri and cheese made on the premises . Add to that a quarter liter of cheap, local wine and you're set for the lazy stroll back home. The total came to 22€ for 3 plates - cheap! No credit cards or receipt given (i.e. they don't pay taxes???) the Little Red Man said Snow , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . A little late, but this is the snow that we had anticipated for our bagna cauda feast this past Sunday. I'm not complaining. You can never trust the weatherman these days anyway.. Later in the day... CaTcH Me iF U cAn - VROOOOOSHH!!! I ain't no TURTLE Now while many fans appreciate the presence of Clooney in Italia (the actor is a consummate showman), I have often wondered if he ever learned to pick up the language. Whenever he's on italian news it seems to me that reporters always speak to him in english, and of course the media need only call out his name to snap that news-breaking shot. What, he's been in this country for like 7 years or so? Well, for the first time ever I find George saying more than just “ciao”, because at 0:23 he says “Come stai” How are you? That's a start. Pulcinella , originally uploaded by latigi / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Voi avete chiesto and I found an answer. Carnevale in Italy may be over for this year, but the information I've recently come across is too useful to wait until the next. Ever wondered who were all of those masked characters during carnevale festivities? I think everyone will easily recognize Arlecchino (the Harlequin), but there are many, many disguised personalities who make up the Commedia dell'arte theater of mid-15th century Italy. I had no idea of the total count until my trusted source of italian trivia (that's my husband aka Man-of-the-House or MotH) found a site that details a long list which also includes characters particular to a specific region. The main page is in italian, but if you click on the names at right, there are both italian and english descriptions. Link: SIPARIO Radio Arlecchino And while we're on the topic of masked persons, I strongly suggest this italian grammar website for intermediate students. Learning the passato prossimo (present perfect), passato remoto (past absolute), imperfetto (imperfect) and other verb tenses can be a real pain, but Radio Arlecchino employs an engaging teaching method that involves a few Commedia dell'Arte characters, thus making learning those wretched conjugations fun, if not easier, to grasp. Free pdf transcripts and mp3 audio files are available for download by clicking on the Podcasts link in the navigation bar. They haven't updated since the beginning of December, but what lessons they do have are worth looking into. Photo credit: www.flickr.com/photos/abels / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Hot.... bath ....anchovies... butter ...olive oil....and lots and lots of garlic . Yesterday's snow didn't fall in the chestnut forest like it was supposed to, but I'd be interested to know what the odds are that someone, somewhere, decided to chase the chill by jumping right into a bubbling pot of bagna cauda like that above. Not literally, of course, even though it takes a cast iron stomach and nerves of steel to be able to properly enjoy this potent piemontese specialty. Also spelled bagna caoda (BAHN-yah COW-dah), this "bath hot" is a simple country dish that gathers the bestest of friends when the first nip of autumn hits the air. I've been to one such party in Piemonte years ago and it lasted more than 4 hours, stretching well beyond the midnight hour in a daze of drunken garlic breath and laughter. We have never been able to organize a party at ours because we just don't know of anyone in town who loves garlic and anchovy to the point of reeking for a worthy cause. Do you? Bagna Cauda for two, just tell me quando quando quando Because the season for this dish is soon to end. And while I can't say it was Fergie's vocals to get things on a roll, yesterday was as good a time as any to perfume the house. Some cooks will suggest soaking the garlic in milk in order to take away some of the bite, but I prefer to skip this step and tackle bagna cauda head on. The most important thing is to cook the sauce on VERY low heat, even if this means standing at the stove and moving your pot on and off the fire to prevent the garlic from browning. Brown garlic = bitter. Not good. For a party of 2 you will need: • 6 large cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thin • 1/4 cup butter • 4-6 anchovy fillets (I use the ones in oil), chopped • 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil • assorted cooked vegetables: topinambur , cardoon , cauliflower, beets, grilled onions • assorted fresh vegs/fruits: endive, cherry tomatoes, celery sticks, bell peppers, pears Instructions : Gently melt the butter and add the garlic slices, cooking on a very low flame until softened. Add the anchovies and olive oil. Continue to cook gently until the anchovies fall apart. Remove from heat. If you prefer a smooth sauce, process briefly with a handheld blender. To serve, pour sauce into individual fojòt like the ones below, or keep warm in a fondue-style dish in the center of the table. Pile up the vegetable platters and pour the wine. Vegetable platter, cured meats (prosciutto, lardo and speck), and lots of bread. Another reason to love bagna cauda - dipping your food. Forks optional. And for Gemini's like me who just want it all because we can't make up our minds. The table is never complete without affettati and olives. “Mmmmm... beeeeeer” , originally uploaded by Rubber Slippers In Italy . Blech! Maybe because I made a wrong move in trying this with gorgonzola-potato focaccia and shichimi togarashi chicken sticks. Or perhaps it's the fault of my diminished senses due to a rotten cold, but this beer tastes just shy (sniffs deeply from an empty bottle) of donkey piss. Mind you, that's saying what I would imagine donkey pee to taste like, but after having enjoyed some terrific brews of all colors and flags, the only thing worth mentioning about Duff is the cute label. MotH said something like “Beck's with a sweet aftertaste”. I couldn't even go more than half a glass, it was that bad. Cheap pilsener at an inflated price. Produced in Germany, this is &#252;ber highway robbery no matter what they say. Simpsonophiles, take note: a 6-pack cost us 17€ worth of donuts. That's just a little over 23 bucks. Doh! You ask and I answer. And to set the record straight, it is NOT “Ciao il mio nome è...” Chiamare | to call I know I'm not the first to say that a little goes a long way in trying to communicate in a foreign language, but when introducing yourself in italian, it's as simple as 3 words plus your name. Example: Ciao, mi chiamo Rowena (informal) or Salve, mi chiamo Rowena (formal). Literally it translates to Hi, myself I call Rowena , but once you get the hang of the syntax it becomes easier. Of course after you've introduced yourself, you'll want to ask the other person's name. What is your name? Come ti chiami? | KOH-meh tee kee-AH-mee (informal) Literally, How to you/yourself you call? What is your name? Come si chiama? | KOH-meh see kee-AH-mah (formal) This is the polite form used when speaking to strangers or persons of authority. What is his / her / its name? Come si chiama? (Note the example answers given) His name is Peter. Si chiama Pietro. Her name is Mary. Si chiama Maria. Its name is Cousin Itt. Si chiama Cugino Itt. Italian verbs become even more interesting when used as an imperative or urgent request: Call the police! Chiama la polizia! Don't call the police! Non chiamare la polizia! And then it gets downright confusing when the english-to-italian translation requires a different word to express something correctly. For us, call has a broader meaning but in italian, it's necessary to use a new verb/word altogether: • I will call you back in a few minutes. Ti richiamo tra un paio di minuti. ( richiamare = to call back) • It's not nice to call a person names . Non è carino canzonare le persone. ( canzonare = to tease) • Call your sisters to dinner! Di' alle tue sorelle di venire a cena! (imperative) Literally, Tell to your sisters to come to dinner. The imperative for dire | DEE-reh (to tell) has a slanted dot above the letter "i". Dì la verita! Tell the truth! That's it for today, I'm calling it quits.
