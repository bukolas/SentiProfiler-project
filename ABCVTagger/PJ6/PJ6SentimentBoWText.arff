'Firstly, I enjoyed Robert\'s video this morning.I liked the idea of likening my disease to a parasite, a parasite making my decisions for me.Then there was Robert\'s group I had mixed emotions here, I liked the psychodrama as I know the things I\'d like to have in my life, and I pray my recovery is strong enough to counter - balance my addiction.However the Rania affair was a little upsetting, in the sense that she seemed to give up so easily after being confronted.What really shocked me though, was the sudden departure of Julie.I had no prior knowledge of her intentions to leave, and before I knew it I was saying my farewells on the doorstep.I\'ll miss Julie loads, and I just hope so much that everything works out well for her.Besides these events, I\'m feeling really good. I feel I\'m relaxing into the program and I\'m extremely hopeful.The fact that I thought I was merely going to see a counselor on Wednesday evening, which was organized by friends, has made me feel greatly let down when I woke up on Thursday morning in a strange place.  I was fully aware of my whereabouts and my initial thoughts were \"get the fuck out of here\".However, having a strained relationship with my wife due to my alcoholism and drug taking, I was left with little choice but to stay.I would have liked to at least think about it before I made a decision for which I am very resentful.I would however like to complete the program in as short a time as possible, considering I have done it once already in August of this year.I know I can leave when I want and will discuss this with my wife on 25-12-94.After two or three days of feeling really quite          positive, I seem to have ended up back at          square 1 by the end of today.          I guess I found all of today\'s events quite          disturbing.            I started with Jo\'s Step 1 which basically just          centered around Saturday\'s events which I could          really relate to and started me thinking about          food for the rest of the day.          That was then followed by Sean\'s collage which          was mind-blowing.          I just couldn\'t believe that so much crap could          happened one person who is so young.          I feel extremely sorry for Sean but I felt he          presented his collage very well indeed and held          a captive audience for a full 40 minutes which          just shows how good it was.          He really shared a tremendous amount of pain.          The process group got very  with Chiara          walking out and Jo admitting to relapsing          earlier and then of course the Tristan Saga.          So now I really don\'t know whether I\'m coming          or going and am doubting my being here again.          I\'ve started to think about work quite a bit          today and am wondering about what\'s going on          there.           If I left the program early, would I be able          to maintain my abstinence outside.          This is what I have to ask myself.I had a bit of a lethargic day.Justine\'s psychodrama did make me recall the nightmare I had when my wine business high difficulties with cash flow.The permanent juggling I had to do with figures to keep everyone happy caused me great stress, and I used to drink a lot on that to relieve the pressure.This was possibly the beginning of the end as regards my alcoholism, as I went steadily downhill from here onwards.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.65,0,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.31,0,0,4.96,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.89,0,6.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.72,0,0,4.96,0,0,0,0,0,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,3.31,19.83,3.31,0,0,0,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.96,Male52
'Today\'s excursion was great, managed to find a machine in the amusement arcade called (crab cracker) it allows the player to knock seven tons of shit out of it. Its  a great way to went your feelings I would recommend one installed at Promis.I really enjoyed the sense of freedom and for the first time in weeks didn\'t feel glad to come back to treatment.Most of the day I\'ve been fairly positive and happy, I thought Tristan\'s step 1 went better than the last one.I also saw the psychiatrist, and that went fairly well.I got everything out that I wanted to and I\'m feeling very hopeful.However, my thoughts tonight are totally dominated by the events at the NA meeting in Canterbury.There were no problems at all until Tristan was asked to do the chair.He started off talking at total tangents, with one sentence totally disconnected to the next.I happened to be sitting right next to Tristan.Suddenly, from nowhere he started going off on one at me.Not in a mildly abusive manner, he really started going for it.He was screaming his head off with his eyes bright red, in an unbelievably aggressive manner, looking directly at me.I was totally unprepared, it came from nowhere.I tried to help him with his step 1 last night, and I\'ve been chatting away with him today.To, be honest I was shocked, at first I was frightened I didn\'t know what was going to happen.Then I started getting angry, I was preparing myself for the first punch to be thrown.I really was expecting him to jump up and start laying into me, so I was trying to prepare myself for the event.I wanted to react in some way, I mean I was sitting there taking really major abuse.However, I really didn\'t want to show any reaction, I think Tristan\'s chair had freaked the rest of the group out enough, and I thought any reaction from me would only worsen the situation.After the meeting I was fuming.I hadn\'t shared and I hadn\'t taken in a thing from the meeting as I\'d been totally pre-occupied with Tristan.At the moment I\'m a lot calmer, However I\'m still very concerned about the effect Tristan\'s going to have on my concentration.I don\'t hold it totally against Tristan, he has a lot of problems to deal with.I\'m not certain his anger was directed at me, I hear him talking to himself or an imaginary friend quite often.He often gets aggressive with this person, and I wonder if I personify that person to him, that\'s why the anger was directed at me.I really like Tristan, but tonight he really freaked me out.Tomorrow I am going to try and speak to a counselor about it.Thank you all for a great day!  A great effort made by all.For what I thought was going to be my worst Christmas, I was nicely surprised.I greatly appreciated seeing my wife today which has improved my outlook on Promis.I am also grateful to Elizabeth for helping me explain to Martine my motives for  a Day Care plan which I think she now understands a lot better.I shall do my best to share my feelings in group this coming week.Many thanks to you all again.My first experience of Psychodrama today, which I found very interesting.It produced a very powerful and emotional group and was obviously of great benefit to those involved.I enjoyed my wife\'s visit today and the time we spent together in Canterbury.We seem to be getting on a lot better now, but there is still a long way to go.Four hours a week makes it difficult to make any real progress.Otherwise I am feeling relaxed and look forward to my Step One on Monday.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,5.96,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,2.98,0,26.82,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.96,0,2.98,0,0,0,20.86,22.35,2.98,0,0,0,5.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.92,Male52
'I managed to get the two things that were pre-occupying my thoughts off my chest today.The first was the situation at home with the arcade and my step-dad.I shared in the gender group.I feel better for sharing them as it always seems to take some of the confusion away.However, somehow these are still heavily on my mind and I feel that they are only half shared, and I didn\'t get it all out.I\'ve shared them outside of group but there\'s still something there.I\'ll wait until I\'ve seen my girlfriend and then maybe I\'ll try to catch a counselor on Monday.On the whole I\'ve felt good today.I\'ve grown very attached to Promise and the people here and I\'m very grateful for the power it has given me to make choices.There\'s no guarantee I\'ll make the right ones, but at least now I have a choice.I\'ve felt angry, agitated, scared and resentful today.Again I\'ve let little annoyances get to me today, and have tried to deflect from my issues as I haven\'t really wanted to look at them.The main ones are my girlfriend and the predicament I\'m going to find myself in when leaving.I find both these issues confusing and worrying especially my girlfriend.I\'m struggling with her, every time we talk we end up arguing as I always seem to say the wrong thing.I need to start getting on top of this issue as it\'s taking up a lot of my time and starting to get me down.Chiara\'s role play was both powerful and a hard role for me to play, I wanted to do it justice.When Ken asked me how I felt about the role, and showed me the likeness to myself it was quite harrowing.The role I was playing, to an extent, wasn\'t that far from what I used to be like in my attempts to get money.Really weird day for me today.          Mixed emotions all day long.          Feedback group was a first for me and I found          it good to know at what stage everyone was at.          That was followed by George\'s step 1 which was          very good and then a process group.          I felt quite happy and content to being with          but that changed to concern with Thanasi and          Mark who have been acting out of character for          the last 24 hours.          I don\'t know the first thing about drugs and so          I have do idea about what the symptoms are.          Anyway, other peers have expressed concern and          I decided to tell Tara who later told one to          share it in the gender group.          This I did and you know the rest.          I don\'t regret it but I\'ve certainly become the          Big Bad Wolf with peers pointing fingers at me          and telling me that I should have said          anything.          Anyway I did and think it was the right thing          today.                    Katie went completely over the top in          Meditation this evening saying how concerned          she was with the general feeling of unrest in          the home, as she looked at me, and that          everyone should concentrate on their own          recovery rather than bicker about other peers.          Oh well, I\'m sure I\'ll weather the storm.Kevin\'s life story was interesting and I was          extremely encouraged by his faith in the twelve          steps as he is tailoring them to combat his          depression.          Alice\'s Step 1 was deep and thoughtful and          bought up a lot for me on the soul searching          side of things and not liking what you find.          My second feedback group was much better than          my first.          It\'s been tough so far and I know it\'s going to          get tougher but at least I\'m a little bit          nearer to Step 5.          Time is a real issue for me but I don\'t want to          leave without doing my 4 and 5; I want to          complete all five steps.          It was sad hearing that a few more friends will          be leaving so soon, especially Paul 1, my room          mate, as we have shared quite a lot over the          last 3/4 weeks and he has really helped me.          It\'s weird but the only other male that I          really share a lot with is Paul 2 who is the          complete opposite of Paul 1 but we seem to be          able to discuss the deepest of things with each          other.                    He seems to be hiding a lot behind his macho          exterior.            I felt really sorry for Dawn in feedback having          the news of her weight statistician, especially          in public which was a bit insensitive.          I felt Amanda\'s very clever though and so maybe          she did it for a reason.          Steve\'s life story on relapse was weird to say          the least as he says he\'s looking forward to          recovering ASAP so that he can go out and drink          socially.          No food thoughts today which is excellent.          Feeling quite positive and content.

'It was a relaxed day.I enjoyed the psycho-drama, I felt it was quite powerful and the message was put across in a simplistic and direct manner.It just made me feel positive about what I want out of life.The rest of the day I\'ve spent relaxing and getting little things I\'ve needed to do out of the way.I had a good chat with John S and that gave me a few pointers for the post promise.On the whole I feel happy and positive and looking forward to the possibilities I have in life.The group seemed uneasy to me today my own feelings were of sadness over the country club ban.I found Nigel\'s Step 1 sad.The Dover AWE was good so that cheered me up and day ended with me feeling happy.Today, as a whole, has left me feeling grateful and positive.I awoke this morning feeling much as I did yesterday, Angry, confused, stagnant and quite isolated.I felt like this right up until the process group and I felt myself slipping into depression as I continued to progress.In the process group I shared exactly how I was feeling.At the time sharing this didn\'t really make me feel any different, and when the counselors seemed to pick on the wrong things I thought I\'d come out the same way as I came in.But I didn\'t, I came out feeling relieved and positive.I\'ve realized by sharing what I\'m REALLY feeling seems to bring me closer to the group, and a weight seemed to be lifted.Well, my bubble has finally burst, the happy          pills have worn off and I\'ve had a shit day.          Woke up late.          Got to breakfast late; which put me in a bad          mood all morning and then had a slinging match          with Jorge in the dining room at lunch and          ended up by threatening him with violence.          This worked and he shut up but then I felt          guilty as this was uncharacteristic and I know          that I would have been thrown out if I did hit          him.          Worked at preparing  and finishing my steps 2 &          3 this afternoon for tomorrow and now feel very          happy with my answers.          Process group number 2 centered around George which          really pissed me off but I think it\'s an          excellent idea to make him Deputy Group leader          as maybe it will make him wake up to his          responsibilities.          Tracy\'s life story was very honest and it          obviously took a lot of courage to share what          she did.          Felt down all day for no particular reason but          hope to feel better tomorrow and am looking          forward to steps 2 & 3.          Not looking forward to Paul 1 going but hope I          get Paul 2 in my room.

'Today was a good day I had lunch with my wife after Adrian\'s lecture which we both enjoyed.I seem to have had no withdrawal systems from coming off at the prozac.I would like more exercise not only to control my weight but also my high cholesterol I intend to diet and ask for more vegetarian meals for myself.Today I felt great I would like to know what my chance\'s are of out-patient treatment.Today has been a good day, for me and I look forward to tomorrow.My brother saw Robert and Jan and I gather had a good talk.I think he is thinking hard about whether or not it is a good idea to come here which I am still here.I have left the ball in his court, but have a feeling he might go elsewhere under these circumstances.It is probably a good idea really even though it doesn\'t bother me.Step 5 dominated proceedings today.Entering the crypt I felt extremely nervous and wondering if I could be totally honest.I was glad the time shot by.I came out with a feeling of relief and serenity.I felt extremely peaceful and at ease it wasn\'t as strange as I thought.Thinking about things I\'ve never shared before and after a while it came quite easily.The prayed was very special and the whole experience was very cleansing.The rest of the day I spent allowing things to sink in.I came together to share in meditation, which felt quite strange.The group seems quite disjointed and needs to gel more.I\'m sure in time this will happen.          Woke early after a very restless night.          Tristan constantly chatters and cries out in          his sleep and Perry got up and left the room 3          or 4 times in the night.          Feeling low and anxious.          First Group very good but left me pretty shocked.          Other patients\' problems seem to be far more          severe than mine.          I found Relaxation `excellent\' it really helped          me to unwind and calm down.          Did not enjoy PEER Evaluation at all.          It seemed very fierce and aggressive and my          heart went out to Katie who showed me nothing          but kindness since I arrived.          Life Story was quite good but again left me          with a question mark about whether I should be          here or not.          It was clear that both Katie (Peer Evaluation) and          Dawn (Life Story) have had either a fairly          dramatic or traumatic life and so there were          points there that they had to deal with but I          haven\'t had the same problems to cope/deal          with.

'Felt relatively good for of the day today but          a little disappointed that I didn\'t do my Step          1 having psyched myself up for it.          However, I did quite enjoy the Group Goal          session as it was the first one I had, where I          had valid input as the first one I just sat in          on.          Paul\'s collage was good  although I couldn\'t          relate to it much, apart from the drinking with          a group at work, but it obviously brought up a          lot for him.          Paul\'s my room mate and we chatted until quite          late last night and he said that doing his          collage really made him realize how much he had          forgotten.          He was really quite upset about a lot of          things.          I hope things do change for me here after my          step 1 as I do want to sort everything out but          I only have a limited amount of time here.          I don\'t know why but I just can\'t stop thinking          of work today.          I guess I\'m just worrying about how business is          doing and how my team are coping.          My MD is managing them at the moment so I know          everything should be OK but its only natural to          be concerned.          I miss work so much its untrue.          I feel that I\'m losing my personality or          identity here and I don\'t know why.          You\'ve got Marcus going around shooting people,          Thanasi holding up chemists with water pistols          and others selling their bodies to feed their          addictions and I don\'t quite know where I am          suppose to fit into all of this.My opinions changed quite drastically in Bob\'s collage today.I\'ve been speaking to Bob a fair amount since he arrived, and I\'ve heard a lot of stories about his wife.I started to become really pissed off with her, and I resented the way she treated him.I don\'t think she\'s totally innocent, but in the collage today that many of her reactions were probably a consequence of Bob\'s addiction that he must really look at his 50\%.In the same vein I must look at my 50\% in my relationships.Although I don\'t think this is such a big thing for me, as I know most of the damage in my relationships was done by my addiction, and I never received any bad reactions from the other side, only concern and care.This makes me feel all the more guilty.I\'m really glad Carol\'s back and she seems to have arrived with a totally new attitude.However, I\'m sad to see Emma leave, but happy that she\'s left in a positive frame of mind, I think she will do really well as long as she\'s vigilant.As for me I\'ve been fairly happy today, but I\'m a little concerned how little I\'m sharing in group.I have a lot going through my head, but I feel it hard to find things to talk about of necessary importance.As soon as I get into group I seem to dry up of thoughts, I\'m trying to keep me feet on the ground and remind myself of the importance of what I\'m doing.I was glad to see Barnaby being made group leader.I felt he needed some extra responsibility as I have seen him slipping back into old Behavior over the last few days.I know he has spoken about this is his SES sheet.I found Tracy\'s psychodrama very powerful today and it helped me realize how serious anorexia is.I enjoyed my visit today and was pleased to see that my parents have taken my brothers predicament better than I had thought.I now have Step 2 and 3 coming out of my ears and am very tired, so I think it is time for bed.Meetings always seem an effort to go to, but end up giving me a lot of material to work on.Tonight was the same.I thought the lady who shared was amazing.She was such a brave person, after all the shit she\'d had in her life here she was sharing how she was starting to get in touch with herself.She was a real example and has made me very determined.She also made me doubt alot of parts of my recovery which I will discuss with my peers, as I have to go to bed.',3,-4,1,1,5,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.66,0,2.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.32,0,0,0,6.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.96,0,2.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.57,0,0,6.65,0,2.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.32,22.61,0,2.66,0,0,0,0,0,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.63,Male52
'It\'s been a happy type of day.The group, on the whole, has been extremely vivacious.This has proved contagious and has certainly rubbed off on me.I enjoyed the groups today and felt that something was gained from each of them.I particularly enjoyed the gender group, due to its size and intimacy.I\'ve tried to block outside influences from my mind, I\' going to speak to my girlfriend soon and try and get things sorted out.She must do what she has to do, at the moment.I realize I must concentrate on myself and in the long run this should prove more helpful to her.I\'d like to get more to grips with the program now, I suppose it takes time and this should start happening more as I approach step 1.Had a reasonable nights sleep, but awoke around          3:00 a.m. to find Tristan standing in the          middle of the room looking at me.          If found it really disconcerting.          He\'s really getting to me at the moment, he\'s          so inconsiderate in the room.          Apart from that I\'ve had a weird day, feeling          thoughtful and guilty about being here.          Had a chat with Barnaby which helped a lot.                    Told my life story today.           More came out than I wanted, but I\'m very          surprised at everyone\'s reaction.                    As a result I am feeling a lot more positive          and a part of things.          Not looking forward to another night with          Tristan and Perry.I had an absolutely wonderful time last night and this morning.I stayed in a hotel right next to Canterbury Cathedral and had a lovely meal.Catrin and myself really had a great time, and I\'m not sure how I feel about our relationship at the moment, but it does feel better.I also did not drink or smoke although opportunities to do both arose.I allowed my girlfriend to do both, as I feel that if I can\'t handle that, I certainly won\'t be able to manage when I leave.All in all its been a happy type of day, and I feel quite refreshed.Sean\'s leaving ceremony was very moving for me.          He was a really good mate and I saw a lot of          myself in him.          He\'s done really well and has left me wondering          if I\'ll ever get that far.          Process group was good until Linda gave her          speech after Jo and Alice.          It really  hit home and made me realize how          much my overeating has screwed up my life.          I just couldn\'t help it, I hated it.          Session with Elizabeth was quite heavy but          quite good.          I\'m beginning to do some real soul searching          but I\'m not sure if maybe I\'m just looking for          something in the past to blame all this on.          It seems to just be a vicious circle.          Step 1 part II tomorrow and chat with Linda in          the afternoon, wonder what that\'s all about?          EJ\'s Step 1 was very good and it brought up a          lot for me but it all seemed a bit factual.          Elizabeth has given me a lot to think about and          so maybe I should start sharing out of group          more.',4,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.33,0,0,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.49,11.01,0,1.83,0,0,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.01,Male52
'I\'ve had a fairly productive day.I was rather anxious about the phone calls I was going to make last night, but after speaking to Amanda I feel I have a clearer idea of how I\'m going to handle them.I\'ve phoned my mum and told her that I don\'t want them to take any of the pressure, it\'s not their problem.I thought the process group was a good one, with a lot of feelings coming out.I was saddened by Rania leaving as I felt she\'d made a big step forward by just listening and not trying to retaliate to everything which was said, although looking at it realistically I suppose she does need more time to really be sure that SHE wants recovery.Malachy\'s role play was hard for me to identify with, I thought Adrian played the role brilliantly.At one stage Malachy was going to come out feeling the whole thing was a bit fake, but it really touched him.I was quite touched by how emotional the whole room became.Apart from the groups the day seems to have drifted by, apart from my concern at one stage that I was setting myself up for something after I left.However after consulting some of my peers I feel better in the knowledge that now I am questioning things that before I would have done instinctively.I had a very useful chat with Tatu today.I realize I have a lot of pent up anger which I don\'t really have a release for, bar small resentments and fairly minor incidents.One of the main reasons I don\'t vent my anger and other feelings as they arise is that I am still intellectualizing and justifying a lot.I don\'t allow myself to let out anger at relatives and people around me because I still felt I was bad and owed them something, I\'m starting to realize that ALL my feelings are valid and should be allowed out.I also tried very hard to keep things in the day, today, and not to mess my head up with projection.However, I do feel I have to start thinking about my plans for when I leave.Today Step 1 was hard to follow I thought, also Laia\'s college was difficult to relate to for me.I\'m glad to come off the prozac.I\'ve felt more positive since my step 1 and at this moment in time I feel good.The process group proved to be very upsetting but my own feelings are that if people are not honest then they are showing their own recovery they really haven\'t found their own rock bottom.I showed my anger with fellow peers who were obstructing me in  my job as a table layer I\'m sorry but no apologies.I think I\'m married to a compulsive helper which is something I will have to learn to except.',3,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.97,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.92,0,0,5.99,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,33.94,3.99,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.99,Male52
'Today has been a long day although I\'ve enjoyed myself the AWE meeting was large but I managed to share at the end of the day I feel average.I had a good day today.I am pleased to have done my steps 2 and 3 and gone through them so thoroughly. I feel I have a much clearer picture of what I must do, and understand the concept behind them much more clearly.My brother is now safely locked away in the Charter Clinic so I day say my parents will be relieved.He decided against Promis because I am still here and thought it would cause complications.In short I\'m cheerful, feeling positive and surprisingly willing!!Good night Sleep tight.I\'m a great believer in keeping it simple so to sum up today I\'ve been happy, I\'ve been sad, I\'ve been angry, but most important I\'ve not drank so I\'ve been proud.I actually enjoyed doing my psychodrama today.I found it a very good way to look at my treatment so far and it gave me a good insight into what I should be aiming to do when  I leave.A very positive insight indeed.I look forward to my meeting with Titus tomorrow and hope that my wife and I can find a suitable way to deal with the task we have ahead of us.Another challenge to be tackled so onward we go.That\'s it.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.2,0,8.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,56.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.1,40.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.29,Male52
'Weird, after feeling very positive yesterday, I          woke up feeling very tired and lethargic.          However, I enjoyed Robert\'s group this morning          except for the bit about \"how I felt having a          woman\'s disease\" which I thought was a bit          aggressive.          With Robert in particular, I feel that he is          deliberately prompting me to open up and share          about being gay in the group.            It wasn\'t the comment today but also yesterday          when he was discussing the play in group, he          asked Ashley and Perry (who both dressed as          women) if they were concerned about people          thinking that they were gay.          They both replied No! and then Robert said it          shouldn\'t make the slightest bit of difference          if anyone was gay or not, and then for him to          give me a long hard stare.          I felt he was telepathically saying \"go on          Mark, follow it up, admit it and share\", but I          couldn\'t.          This is something that I am going to do because          I feel that if I don\'t admit it, it may act as          a barrier and stop me sharing in group because          I\'m frightened of slipping up.          I will try and do it ASAP but it won\'t be          easy and I\'m worried about people\'s reactions.          I\'ve already told 3 Peers who have been          brilliant about it, but I have reservations          about sharing this with the rest of the group          but I feel it is necessary if I am to progress          with the program.                    Other than that I enjoyed Father Martin\'s          lecture which I felt was quite inspiring.           Enjoyed my visitors very much who were          extremely supportive and found it very relaxing          to find out what was going on in my world back          home.          Because it was couldn\'t          use the Gardens and so it was a little          difficult to talk but we grabbed an hour in the          staff dinning room which I was grateful for.          I would like to go  out for a drive next week          with my visitors if possible.                    I am looking forward to being off of 1st week          status tomorrow and walking out to the post          office and making phone calls.          It\'s funny how the simplest things in life,          when denied, suddenly become very valuable.                    On the whole feeling a lot more settled and          positive and hope to increase my productivity          in group this week. I know what I have to do!I feel very relieved to have my step 5 behind me, and a lot better about myself having done it.I did not think that it would have such a great effect.I am now very tired as a result!All in all it was a good day.I had seen the Father Martin Video a couple of times before but it none the less served as a very good reminder as to what I am up against - Ken\'s lecture afterwards drone the point home completely.That\'s it.Good nightIt was a busy day today Chris step 1, Goals Group, and Karen\'s College I really enjoyed it.The AA meeting was also rewarding for me I\'ve finished my day happy.All in all a very sad day for me today.          Groups this morning were very good and          Barnaby\'s Psychodrama didn\'t bring up anything          for me immediately but Robert asked me to try          and identify which I did about one aspect.          I\'ve been thinking about it ever since and have          been tearful all afternoon as a result.          On top of that there\'s all this disruption with          Marcus and Thanasi which made for a very tense          mediation.          It seems that my suspicions were right and they          were using, however I understand that Thanasi          tempted Marcus with heroin in return for a          urine sample which Thanasi would then say was          his own.          I feel more annoyed with Thanasi than Marcus          but feel that they should both leave.          I don\'t blame Marcus.          The way I was feeling on Friday, I would have          accepted  food if it was offered, but it wasn\'t          and  I\'m glad it wasn\'t.          This is my recovery which I am working            hard for and is costing me a lot of time and          money and I wouldn\'t appreciate somebody          screwing it up for me.          Yes, I would accept food now but I would like          to think that further down the line in          treatment I would be strong enough to say NO.          However, this is a treatment center, and I          wouldn\'t even want the temptation.

'I feel I have got a lot off my chest today in both group and my Life story.I greatly appreciated the time you spent with Martine and myself this afternoon and think I would like to take the Day Care option.I would like to confirm with Martine tomorrow and speak with you again about this.Many thanks.There\'s a lot going on for me after the news of my step dad having a heart attack.The obvious feelings of uselessness, vulnerability, sadness and guilt.I\'m thinking more sensibly now and I don\'t think I\'ll leave here to see him and help the family, although my heart feels I should.I could write loads here, but I think I\'d prefer to do that tomorrow night.My meeting with Titus this afternoon I found very productive, making me think about areas in my life which I don\'t think about very much   days.My Collage proved a lot harder to do than I thought but is now finished.I hope I can get across what I intended tomorrow.All in all I had an all right day, and ma now suitably knackered so I\'m off to bed.The psycho-drama this morning was extremely powerful for me.I could identify with it very strongly and I have been discussing some of the contents of it previous to the drama.I have a real problem with building up resentments towards other people for menial reasons and with projecting about future situations until I get myself into a depressive stupor.I now believe I do these things, and many others, to prevent myself from actually looking at the thing I should be, me!The problem being that I see these things in group, but find it difficult to do anything about them outside of group, for example I don\'t know how to start looking at myself.I often start to slip back into the way I was before.The rest of the day has been pleasurable and I\'ve really enjoyed myself.The share was quite good, and reminded me that I have to be very aware of cross-addiction, especially drugs.I feel drained tonight.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.42,0,5.42,0,16.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.39,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.71,0,0,0,0,0,2.71,13.55,5.42,0,0,0,2.71,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.71,Male52
'Still feeling quite good today and positive.           Probably still buzzing about being given my          Steps 2 & 3.            Paul\'s Step 1 was so good.          It was honest, heartfelt and courageous and          good to see him let his guard down and cry.          Process group was also positive despite being          hungry.          As I explained in group, hungry now totally          different to the type of hunger I had when I          first came in, purely physical and not mental.          Good afternoon in the gym and then relaxation          and  into gender group which was OK.          OA meeting was good and I shared about how          positive and I am feeling.          I just hope it lasts as I\'ve am feeling good          for two or three days now and so I\'m getting          ready for a down day.          Having said that I\'m looking forward to          Saturday as Steve phoned today and he\'s now          able to visit on Saturday as he\'s working in          Dover tomorrow.          I wasn\'t having visitors this weekend and so          that was a nice surprise and Elizabeth said          that it was OK           I hope B  gets an OK tomorrow. I feel quite shattered mentally tonight.I\'ve been through ups and downs emotionally.On the way to the meeting and on the way back I felt really positive.Thinking of all the things I can do with my life and the pure pleasure I can hopefully feel.I also believe I can change my personality into something I think I\'ve always wanted to be.The thought of this really lifts me.Then I had a phone call from my friend and it was a really fun phone call.However he told me how boring his life is at the moment and nothings really going on.Sometimes I have this impression that in recovery its going to be great all the time and won\'t experience feelings like this.But I will and I don\'t know how I will handle them.Tonight I feel I\'m really going to need support outside.My girlfriend is coming tomorrow and I\'m confused as I don\'t really know what I want out of the visit and I don\'t know what I want to say or feel.I think I\'ll just take it as it comes.I really did enjoy and gain a lot from Father Martin today, and everybody was right, he is a special guy.What I picked up on most was the turning of negative thoughts into positive ones.Not \'Why am I an addict\' (self-pity) but \'Why have I been chosen and lucky enough to have sobriety\'.He really did make me feel positive.However, I find lectures hard to put into practice and tend to become skeptical of what is said as its not easy to put into practice.Then again I suppose nobody said it would be easy and if it was it wouldn\'t provide much benefit.I had an emotional phone-call from my girlfriend which left me with a lot of feelings one of which was rather subdued.At the moment I feel as if the relationships are going to be the really hard part to deal with in my recovery and I\'m really confused.I need to discuss it a lot.I\'m glad for the process group this morning,          which was quite turbulent, but it gave me the          opportunity to air my concerns over going home          and especially work and my confusion over          abstinence.           I\'m glad that Ken said that it was up to me to          find my own abstinence as that\'s what was said          to me at the OA meeting in Clapham.                    I\'ve decided that I don\'t want to go to the          Promis Day  care center and that I can handle          it on my own.          After all the two days in the office this week          were obviously hectic and I was really hammered          with a lot of work and decisions to make          immediately which was such a contrast to being          here.                    Spoke to Steve this evening and he thinks that          I\'ll be able to handle it OK but he said that I          had changed a great deal and had lost my          personality and sense of humor and thins it\'s          ridiculous that I have to give up drink.                    He\'s also now not too supportive with the          thought of me doing 3 evenings a week at          meetings.          He thought it would just be one a week!                    Dawn\'s shredding was really funny but I feel as          though I am losing a friend who has become very          close and valuable to me.          At least she only lives 5 minutes drive away.

'I got a lot sorted out today from Robert\'s group.I\'ve been holding in a bundle of resentments towards other peers this week, and due to this I\'ve been winding myself up, not sharing (as its a hard thing to share) and basically not progressing.In Robert\'s group I took on board the example of the book of brown stamps.I feel as though I\'ve been carrying around about 10 of these books, so I decided to dump them.I shared my resentments with my peers and they just seemed to evaporate, There is a real power in the group that I\'m just starting to get to grips with.Every time I share something it seems to lose its power.I must keep the sharing up.The rest of the day has been fine, but I still find it hard around my girlfriend.I\'m feeling rather sad tonight, which I\'m sure is heightened by the fact that Carol King\'s playing away in the background.The main reasons for me feeling this way are the phone calls I received tonight.I was wary of my first day of phone calls or the last freedom.I somehow thought it may have a detrimental effect.I don\'t think they did though.I spoke to my mum and I feel so sorry for her, she really doesn\'t deserve all the problems she\'s got.Anyway, she blames herself for everything even my problems and wonders what she did wrong, not in a self pitying way, she really feels somewhere along the line she made a mistake.Overall I\'ve had a lovely chat though and I know she only wants me to get over my addictive disease, so that I can lead a life in which I find happiness and contentment.Also she said my girlfriend phoned last week and she couldn\'t handle any more and felt that she had no choice but to leave me. Although I spoke to my girlfriend tonight and she didn\'t mention this, I think she just said it to my mum in an emotional patch.She\'s put so much into me in the last year and a half I can\'t put it on paper.So much I want to do it for them as well as me.I do understand the concept of doing it for the self though and although they were emotional calls, I\'m already trying to block them out of my mind.It\'s clear that their recovery can only come from mine, and if mine comes from doing it for the self then I have to work along those lines.I have been feeling a little guilty of late, listening to other peoples\' life stories and steps I\'ve heard so many traumas and horrendous experiences, to me it\'s easy to see that after what these people have been through, fucking hell I would have turned to drink and drugs.In my case there are no traumas to state.Nobody hurt me in any way for my addiction to start, it\'s me who\'s done the hurting.However I had a lovely chat with Julie and I see it differently now.In 5 years time if my gambling hasn\'t stopped I could easily be looking back reciting traumas.If the disease is there, it\'s there, and it\'s bound to draw you into circles where nasty happenings are a likely occurrence.The occurrences are an effect of the disease.I\'d really like someone to speak to my mother though, she\'s so confused at the moment, I\'d really like to have her mind put at ease a little.I don\'t think now is the best time though, I think I\'ll speak to someone about it in a few days.Very draining and confusing day.          The tension and confusion of the weekend came          to a head this morning in the process group.          Barnaby came as a complete shock to me but I do          think it was wise to make all three of them go.           After all, this whole program is based on          honesty and they were dishonest.           I\'m concerned for all three of them but          especially Marcus as I felt he was really          getting there.          I was  very confused after the process group          but I seem to have turned my negative thoughts          around to positive ones.          I have to be selfish and put my recovery first,          above everyone and everything else.          The trip to Canterbury was fantastic, it was so          good to get out and do something normal like          shopping and  I was so pleased that I didn\'t          have any food thoughts, even when I was walking          through the food department of M&S.            Trip to the Aylesham Medical Center was also          odd as they have diagnosed me as being          asthmatic.          This is a bit of a shock to me and something          that I\'ll just have to live with.          Chat with Elizabeth was good.          I\'m so much more relaxed now and glad that my          recovery seems to be going well but I\'m a bit          freaked about the co counseling session that          Elizabeth has suggested with Steve for this          Friday.          I don\'t know what can come from it but          nevertheless I will try to organize it.          OA meeting was really honest and open as usual.          I love our meetings but I really think it would          be beneficial if we tried to go out to the OA          meeting in Dover.          I know Malachy said it wasn\'t too good but that          was eight years ago and so maybe it\'s changed          now.          I\'ve never been to any kind of fellowship          meeting in my life and so I think it would be          really useful to go to some OA ones especially          as they are going to be an ongoing part of my          recovery!Not a great deal happened for me today although I did find the \"Tree\" exercise interesting.My brother came clean with my parents about his cocaine addiction so at least all is now out in the open.I did however have to deal with two very upset people and try to reassure them that it was not the end of the world and that now we all know what\'s being going on we can get on with solving the problem.He has done a disappearing act, but I have left a message for him to call here on his answer machine.  Thank you for your help Elizabeth.Otherwise I am still feeling positive which I think is quite a good sign considering all the shit flying around the Howard household.',3,-4,0,1,5,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,4.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,2.67,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,18.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.47,0,0,1.78,0,3.56,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,3.56,17.79,7.11,1.78,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.56,Male52
'Today has been taken up mostly with thoughts about smoking.I\'ve been on edge and quite irritable.However, the main problems have been outside of group, during the smoking breaks and other periods of non - activity.In the groups I\'ve become consumed by the subject and have had no real problems.I\'m feeling positive about the program just as long as things fall into place and I put enough into it.This is still my main worry, falling into a rut of mental non-activity outside of group.I have decided that I would prefer to do Relapse counseling at the promis day center in London.  I have given this much thought and concluded it is the best solution for my problems.The program went smoothly yesterday but I am relieved to have got this decision off my mind.I am hoping that BUPA will pay for the London office treatment and would appreciate your reference.Otherwise all is OK with my therapy so far.Purely in jest!\"I had a little dog, it was a lovely chap, and he went Yap Yap Yap. Now he\'s older he goes Woof Woof WoofHe\'s a big dog now - Now he goes Bow Wow Wow\"Thanks very much I am pleased to have done my collage.I found it very beneficial to have looked at my addiction and what it did to me.When you look at all the consequences collectively it hits home a lot harder, and has really made me think about what the hell I was doing out there.Quite frightening really and it makes the idea of returning to that sort of life very unappealing.Alice\'s \"group script\" was both amazing and very accurate.I hope to see more of them before I leave.Quite drained but positive this morning and it          wasn\'t long before I started having food          thought and hunger pangs.           This is the second day that I\'ve felt seriously          hungry and so I just hope that this is a passing          phase and doesn\'t last long.          Robert\'s lecture was very interesting and the          group was quite good as well.          I identified quite a lot and it also proved to          me that Robert or someone does read significant          event sheets.           Fairly good afternoon.          Had a fairly brisk walk to the post office with          Paul, Rebecca, Emma Jane, and Sheila and had a          good work out in the gym afterwards with          Rebecca and Dawn.          I\'m conscious of the fact that everyone will be          having visitors tomorrow and  I won\'t be, but          that\'s my choice because I told my visitors          last week that I didn\'t want them to come for a          couple of weekends.          This was an attempt on my part to get involved          with the program but I have really got a lot          more involved this week and so I now wish they          were coming.          Anyway I do have an assignment for Elizabeth to          do and so I\'ll probably get that done tomorrow          afternoon.',4,-4,0,2,1,0,3.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,0,0,0,3.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.68,0,9.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.44,0,0,11.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male52
'I feel relaxed and more positive and clear-headed tonight.Up until supper I was feeling angry, frustrated and detached from the group.The last few days have been confusing for me mostly due to my girlfriend and I\'ve felt very stuck and this has built into anger and resentment so I could deflect.This meant I gained little from the groups and didn\'t really feel like sharing.However, I aired some of my resentments to the peers concerned, this cleared my head a lot and since then I\'ve decided to look at my relationship with my girlfriend differently.I\'ve been doing so much projecting and getting heavy about the whole thing its been doing my head in.I\'m determined not to do this anymore, yes I need to look at it, but I\'m going to take it one day at a time and just enjoy speaking and being with my girlfriend and just see how it goes.Out of the ordinary start to the day with the          impromptu process group called exclusively for          Steve.          I am beginning to feel quite resentful towards          him as he is taking up so much valuable time in          group but he must doesn\'t listen.          All he does is intellectualize about everything          and argue and debate rather than share his          related feelings.                    Sheila\'s Step 1 was very moving and powerful.          I couldn\'t relate to much but I did have          chuckle to myself about the bathroom.          The bathroom seems to be the most important          room in an addicts house, like Sheila I used to          hide my drug of choice (food) in the bathroom          and eat it with the door locked knowing that no          one would interrupt me.          Perry\'s collage was excellent, funny,          everything was in hysterics.                    Family meeting was a bit nerve-wracking.          I wrote to Steve earlier in the week and told          him not to worry about the meeting but just to          be relaxed and honest.          The problem was that he was too bloody honest.          I have trouble getting Steve to talk but          Elizabeth just got him spouting out about          everything she wanted to hear and more.          He went into overdrive and I just wanted to          shut him up, but the more Elizabeth asked the          more he talked and I could see her eyes          clocking up all of these other problem areas          that she would work on in the future.          He told her about my other two obsessions and          her eyes just lit up, you could see her saying          `BINGO\' to herself.          She saw me looking at her and laughed and then          I said \"Great, I\'m not going to be out of here          until next year now!\"           Despite all this she was excellent at really          bringing home to Steve how my life would have          to change in the future and what compulsive          overeating was really all about.          He knew quite a bit already but took everything          in that he didn\'t.          Overall the meeting was very good.          Elizabeth then sent us out for a meal and asked          us to talk about everything we had discussed          and how we showed  our lifestyles and my          approach to work.          Going out for my first abstinent meal was a          nightmare.          We parked in central Canterbury and I think we          must have looked around 10 restaurant menu\'s          before I found one that I thought would be OK.          We talked for hours and I seemed to manage an          abstinent meal but I think I worried about it          for too much.          Maybe my pre occupation with food will be          replaced by abstinence. I had a good talk with Martine on the phone this evening.It backed up what I said today in my step one, that we have no problem talking about day to day goings on, and that we do love each other but we can\'t seem to go any further than that.I dare say it took a fair amount of time for us to get into this position, so it seems only logical that it will take a fair amount again to get out of it.Otherwise no complaints and feeling well.Today I was a little frustrated about how little I was sharing.I\'ve felt that I haven\'t been getting much out in groups.This has meant that I\'ve had a distinct lack of feelings.However, I don\'t really know what to share with people because of late I seem to have been thinking very little about my problems.This has led to a drought of feelings to share and I don\'t like the idea of approaching peers and just starting to waffle about my past.Tonight though I have had a few things enter my head.Firstly, how grateful I am to be here in recovery.After the AA meeting I realize that I am extremely lucky to be able to start treating my addiction at such a young age.Whatever happens from now on in, I\'m much more aware of addiction and will never be able to enjoy gambling again.Secondly, on returning from the meeting loads of thoughts started flooding into my head.How do I approach clubs?Young wild people?How far behind am I going to get in music and clothes?How am I going to be able to afford things such as these when I have all these debts to pay? Then it struck me about the importance of not projecting I hadn\'t really thought of it before but now I am really aware of it.Thinking about these things was just tying my brain in knots and depressing me.There were no benefits in projecting and the only way I can deal with these things is to take them one day at a time.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.06,2.06,0,0,0,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,4.13,0,0,0,9.29,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,27.86,0,0,0,0,4.13,0,0,0,37.14,0,0,9.29,0,0,0,0,0,5.16,0,2.06,0,0,0,12.38,9.28,0,0,0,0,5.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,4.13,Male52
'Still felt a little fuzzy this morning and that          has stayed with me all day.          Process group this morning was good with          Robert, especially when he brought up the          subject of Stephen and David.          I am getting very frustrated with myself though          for not speaking up in group, in particular          when they were asking for feedback on Stephen.          I had so much more to say about him which          hadn\'t  been said but I can\'t bring myself to          say anything unless I\'m asked.          I wish I could overcome this.          Extremely pissed about being given another          cross addiction sheet to do.          Probably a result of Steve\'s honesty last          Friday.          I\'ve answered the questions honestly but I          don\'t think that anything has changed          drastically.          Paula\'s chair was quite good and I enjoyed          Sean\'s burning.          I shall be sad to see Sean go as he\'s a really          nice guy and we get on well with each other and          I won\'t have anyone to play croquet with.                    Hated not having visitors today and I\'m going          to make sure that I have loads next week.Another good day on the whole.          Finally got my leaving date of 16th December          from Elizabeth which is good but a little          worrying.          I\'m now extremely glad that I\'m going home          before that, for 2/3 days, and then coming back          for 10 days before finally leaving.          At least then I\'ll have the opportunity to air          any problems or fears that I\'ve had while          away.          Enjoyed Paul\'s\' Step 1 and Jo\'s sculpture thing,          which I thought was really spot on.          Good time in Canterbury this afternoon but got          pissed off when I arrived back with several          bags and was accused of being a compulsive          shopper.            The majority of stuff I brought were Christmas          presents for other people.          David Robinson told me that this woman wants to          come down and interview me tomorrow afternoon          which I am OK about but a little apprehensive.          Elizabeth also wants to see me tomorrow          afternoon and I don\'t know what that\'s all          about.          Still working on Steps 2 & 3. Enjoyed both groups this morning, especially          Pam\'s psychodrama.            It got me thinking that maybe I\'ll have to give          up some of the friendships I have, when in          recovery, which are based around food,          entertainment and eating out.            Felt a bit lower than yesterday which is only          to be expected, as yesterday was so good but          still feeling reasonably happy.          Felt weird seeing everyone\'s visitors and not          having any, still at least I had mine          yesterday.          I\'ve been thinking about the possibility of          moving into halfway here when I\'ve done my 2 &          3 and have come back from London.          I\'ll have my car here then and will only have a          week and a half before I\'m expected back at          work on the 19th December.          I don\'t know what the criteria is for moving          across and it may be totally out of the          question but I think it would be beneficial to          me.          I\'d like to have the opportunity here of going          out in the afternoons etc and then sharing the          next day about problems or temptations that I          may or may not have as when I leave here I have          to go to work immediately.          Maybe I\'ll discuss it with Elizabeth this week. I got a lot of identification from Jake\'s step 1 especially along the lines of what I\'ve put my girlfriend through.The gender group was also productive as it made me realize my tolerance level has increased, and also allowed me to get to the root cause of resentment I sometimes feel towards Barnaby.I feel this has now been cleared up.I spoke to Amanda today and we decided I could deal with a debtor.At this time I felt strong enough to do this, but tonight I have had to doubt my strength.In my mind I have started to make excuses I would use whilst phoning.I have shared this with my peers but it has left me feeling weak.I have decided I will definitely make the call tomorrow, but I need to discuss it more with my peers before doing so.I\'ve also had many feelings revolving around the family.They really need a strong Ashley to emerge from recovery, and for my sakes and theirs I hope I can produce this.',4,-5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.37,0,0,0,4.03,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,20.12,0,2.68,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,29.51,0,0,4.03,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,8.05,9.39,0,5.37,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.71,Male52
'I was interested to see what other people thought about the \"the empty hole that will be left behind having stopped drinking and drugging.I think you people might have got the wrong impression when I said I walked into pubs shouting \"I\'m an alcoholic etc.\"Its not every pub I go into and it is only once, and in the pubs I used to drink.I also found it very successful.It did result in an interesting group and I gained some benefit from it.It will be difficult out there but looking for a new career I hope will keep me busy enough not to worry about it too much.There are several sporting activities I shall play more of like I did in the past so all is far from lost!Today has been a good day for me.I enjoyed Nigel\'s collage although I did think he needed to speak about his future more.Spyros peer evaluation brought out feelings of anger in me simply because I felt frustrated with his self pity.I\'ve felt good since speaking to Spyros about his self pity.My peer evaluation provided me with some useful tools to build with the main one being isolation this is something I will work on both in treatment  and in recovery since I\'ve been in treatment my higher power has grown in strength and I find this so encouraging at this moment in time I feel very confident.I\'m finding it quite hard to write these sheets.So many thoughts moving in and out of my head in such a confused manner, trying to summarize them is tough.Robert\'s lecture was settling.The manner in which he solved such confused issues in such a logical manner gave me a lot of faith in his system and what it will do for me.The rest of the day was up and down.Sometimes I felt like being alone and trying to organize my thoughts, other times a felt lighthearted and wanted to be amongst other people.However, I feel settled and am excited about being among such interesting and varied people, they really are a brilliant group.I spoke for the first time in meditation today and that felt good, I really want to contribute.I am concerned that in such a safe and secure environment I might begin to forget the extent of the problems I was having before I came in.I must remember the reason I\'m here, the pain I\'ve caused, the extent of my problem and not become too relaxed and slip into any ruts.During sessions I have no problems with this, I must just keep my thinking going after the sessions.

'Today has been a major one for me.I think that much has happened and a lot has changed.Of late myself and Malachy have been becoming quite aggressive.We have been feeling that certain peers should stop wallowing in self-pity and start becoming more positive. (Chiara and Carol).At the same time Katy has been annoying me to a ridiculous point.Today I confronted Carol in group, the Chiara heard about me talking about her self-pity and went mad in meditation.At this point I was defensive, I was building up my stories for the confronting after meditation.First I spoke to Chiara, at first fireworks flew, then more and more I realized my feelings behind my anger.1) I felt slightly rejected by Chiara as she had not spoken to me for two days, whereas before we were chatting regularly.Also I realized anger at Carol was misdirected.I wasn\'t pissed off with her, it was that I got on with her so well last time she was here, that when I couldn\'t help her this time again I felt rejected.2) I got the self-pity thing wrong.I\'m a kind of aggressor, I\'ve had nothing malicious done to me in my life and for this reason when I get self-piteous I hate myself for it, I don\'t deserve it.At times like this I have to pull myself out of it and get positive.I suppose I wanted to apply this to Chiara and Carol.However, they have been victims, and although in the end they will need to become positive they also need time to feel the pain they\'ve been through.At times like this they deserve my help and care.3) It was my insecurities that brought on this anger and intolerance and I have to look into myself to see what\'s happening down there.Sometimes I\'ll think people look at me and think \'Ashley\'s all right, he\'s secure handling his troubles with no problems.\'I think on the outside I look strong and not very vulnerable.I feel this is a front as the insecurities and vulnerability are in my head and I don\'t often let them out.I need to work on this.I was feeling that I adore Chiara and Carol and we had a massive hug.Chiara\'s very special to me and sometimes I forget this.I also spoke to Katie and we sorted everything out.I apologized as I realized it was so unfair of me to pick on her little mannerisms and not concentrate on the pain inside her that has come out, and which she needs help in doing so.We are both in recovery, and we have both been hurt in some way.In helping each other we can ease the pain and build our recoveries.I have a changed attitude and I feel tonight I saw and felt the power of the group.Sorry if this doesn\'t all make sense, a lot has happened for metoday and I find it hard to put on paper.Richard\'s collage served as a good reminder to how bad things had got before I came here; a well timed reminder being a week before I leave.I am feeling suitably apprehensive about leaving which is a good sign, but am none the less looking forward to it!No offense!I have told Martine, about our meeting with Titus on Sunday.  I am sure it will be very helpful to both of us and hope reassure her about the future.Otherwise I am battling on with Step 4 and now have a headache.Bed must beckon.Good night.Last night was up and down.The play was brilliant, but the phone call afterwards was really hard work (feelings Book).Today, I\'ve been quite happy.The lecture didn\'t do much for me but the group was extremely powerful.The rest of the day\'s been spent mooching around.I\'ve been trying hard to let go of the stuff that came up yesterday and I\'ve had some success in doing so.I feel good tonight and I\'m just going to take it easy.I\'m really looking forward to the lecture tomorrow.On the whole I\'ve felt good today.I felt process was a bit of a slinging match and I expanded on my feedback to Tracey after the group.I also got a lot of identification from Paul\'s step 1, and this seems to be coming a lot easier now.I\'m very pleased with how I\'m able to deal with my resentments now.At first in the process group I really resented the counselors attitudes, I felt it was both puny and aggressive and very uncomfortable to share around.However I was able to look at what I was doing and deal with it very quickly, so I could concentrate on the rest of the group.I was glad to know my steps 2 + 3 are on the way.I feel ready for them, and I\'m sure they\'re going to be very beneficial for me.I\'m also extremely excited about Friday!',5,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,4.6,0,0,2.3,0,2.3,2.3,0,16.11,0,0,2.3,0,0,0,2.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.5,13.81,0,2.3,1.15,0,0,0,2.3,0,0,0,0,2.3,0,0,0,55.22,0,2.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,73.62,0,0,3.45,0,4.6,0,0,0,5.75,0,0,0,0,0,33.36,18.4,0,4.6,0,0,10.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.3,0,0,4.6,Male52
'Robert\'s comments in the group today started me thinking.It was a real shock when he talked about my school and my possible feelings of inferiority financially.At first I was just stunned at where he\'d got it from, and was quite defensive.I think I was defensive as I did have a lot of friends and I did have a good time so why I should I feel like what he was saying?But now I think the reason for me being defensive was because it was quite close to the bone and quite personal.Its something I haven\'t thought about for a long time and had kind of forgotten about, and certainly something I haven\'t talked about, But thinking about it I think it was something I did have a big problem with.I was always reminded about the money that was around my school, and I did feel it was the only way in which I was different and was my Achilles heel.I thought about it a lot and always tried to cover up and make out I had more that I had.I think it affected the way I thought about my parents as well.I thought they were kind of inferior as they didn\'t have the money or the education of most of the other parents.I was kind of embarrassed of them and tried to keep my home life away from my school life.I wonder how many traits I still carry with me now.This is something I need to look at more.The rest of the day has been relaxed although I am becoming quite pre-occupied with the future and would like to move to half-way quite soon.I\'m also confused about whether I\'ve looked at the past enough?Indeed whether I should be looking backwards, forwards or at the daily things?I need to share more.I had a great chat with Tatu yesterday and its cleared my head a great deal.I\'m going to take things one day at a time and take the words should and must out of my vocabulary.If I can do this its going to take a lot of pressure off.I\'m starting this process by deciding I\'m just going to concentrate just on my step 4 and leave my other issues on the sidelines till I\'m ready to deal with them.I\'ve also decided I\'m still using my head too much to justify.I spoke to my girlfriend tonight and she\'s been thinking a lot about our meeting this week.She\'s decided we shouldn\'t live together and put time aside each week to see each other.I\'m glad she\'s spent time over it and I agree with her, it just leaves me the problem of finding somewhere to live.I spoke to Malachy as well and he was quite upset when he called, which surprised me as he seemed to be getting on very well yesterday.It just reminds me that its going to be tough.However, I feel positive.Much has happened for me today, but at the moment I feel absolutely shattered so I shall discuss briefly.Pippas step 1 was my first food disorders step and I was extremely surprised at just how much I could identify with.The process group I found to be brilliant.I find so much more happens for people in the aggressive groups.For me I had to look at all my Behavior and sharing before today, and I found it to be fake, what I said today in group was the first thing I spoke from the gut.I hadn\'t thought about it I just felt it, It was an amazing experience and I must try to continue on this line.We all shared afterwards and I feel there is an amazing feel to the group at the moment.I\'m feeling fairly well at the moment.I feel as though I\'m slowly slipping further into the program, although I\'m still waiting for my feelings to start really surfacing.I almost feel as though I should be forcing them up.Although I feel as though the step 1 may be  a major event for me.The groups today had limited effect on me, there was little I could identify with and nothing that really stirred my feelings.I went to the smokers group and I\'m going to attempt to give up for the second time this fortnight.The first time I managed a day and a half.The whole time I was totally preoccupied about smoking and couldn\'t concentrate on anything else.This time I\'m really going to try and forget about it, keep myself busy and just try as hard as possible not to dwell on it.No more suppressing my feelings!',3,-3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.74,0,0,4.88,0,0,0,0,0,2.44,0,0,0,2.44,0,2.44,4.88,6.1,0,0,0,2.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.44,Male52
'Catrin came down today, and although I\'m a little confused on what exactly I cleared up, I know I did get some things sorted out.When I first came into the room with Amanda and Catrin I felt REALLY awkward.I didn\'t really know what to say and for some reason I felt I was betraying Catrin, it was very awkward.The chat afterwards was very good, I got honest with her and this gives me the opportunity to continue in that manner.It did drum home to her the importance of us each taking responsibility for  independent, which was a big worry for me.Also she is now keen to start going to meetings.For me, I feel more at ease now I\'m going to take things as they come, do what I know I have to do, with the renewed knowledge that I really do care for Catrin.I didn\'t get through as much as I wanted to today, but I\'ve made a start and its up to me now.On the whole a very good day.          Starting with Perry\'s Peer evaluation and then          the process group.          I wanted to share in the group today but the          content of the group was very good and really          stayed around summarizing Perry\'s Peer          evaluation and Ashley\'s girlfriend troubles, and          so I didn\'t really get the opportunity.          Relaxation was as good as ever but I would have          done without the interruptions.          The one to one session with Graham was very          positive and basically reiterated the way I          have been feeling over the last few days.                    The OA meeting was also good and I opened the          session and came out as I felt that this was          necessary and this was the ideal opportunity to          do so.          Other members then proceeded to offer support          ant said that they were glad that I had shared          this with them.          They also said that they felt it necessary to          hare this with group if I am to progress.          I feel a tremendous sense of relief now and          just have to tell the rest of the bunch.                    Feeling very  very hungry today and the pangs          are really being to BITE.Dear God was a great exercise I never realized a letter could be so rewarding.I\'m sure he heard my message and it\'s good to know I have a friend in recovery now that the so called friend in a bottle has gone.I enjoyed the lecture today my wife says she got a lot from it so has it stands now I feel good.Very sad to see Lynn go, but at the same time happy to see she was so happy.Group process was a confusing and annoying group.I felt with Marcus that the main thing was how he felt inside.Had he taken on board the possible consequences to other peers? More importantly was he treating it like boarding school, does he feel its like being expelled and getting a telling off from his relatives and therefore he doesn\'t really realize that he\'s doing it for himself.In this case it doesn\'t matter if he\'s allowed to stay or not, if he doesn\'t REALLY want to change things for himself.The perfect scenario would be if he could realize why he\'s here, really want to change his life and know that there\'s a better life and really want it.Also to take the glamour out of the drugs.I wonder if this is possible.I\'m sorry if I\'m confusing you, I\'m not putting my thoughts into words very well.What annoyed me was how unseriously Tracey\'s using (being sick) in front of Chiara and Joe\'s  were taken.We\'re always told that making yourself sick is as dangerous to food disorders as a needle is to drug addicts.Today it felt like one rule for one and different rules for another.It just seemed that the two types of using were not considered of equal severity, but I felt they were.As for me I wanted to share about my girlfriend in process group, so I\'ll try this tomorrow.I\'m also still wary that sometimes I\'m forgetting just how bad my life was before I arrived here, and I\'m worried that this will result in me thinking that I don\'t need to change that much.I just don\'t want to put myself under any illusions.',4,-5,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.63,0,2.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.88,0,0,0,0,2.63,0,5.26,0,0,0,13.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.37,0,0,13.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.26,22.34,0,5.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.2,Male52
'The process group did not help me much in easing the frustration I was feeling, except Tatu\'s closing comment that I need to speak from the heart and not from the brain.I feel this is really important and would really start pushing my recovery forward.Which is vital, as I feel the nail was hit on the head in the feedback group, that I really don\'t know which way to go at the moment.However I\'m under no illusion this will be easy, for so long now my life has been ruled from the brain that to transfer this job to the heart will be no facile job.I will seek help from my peers on this one, and hopefully just keep sharing until it starts to happen.I still find it quite hard to share though, sometimes I don\'t know to start.Tonight, I feel fairly nervous, I have tried to be quite critical in my evaluation of Barnaby and I hope I\'ve done the right thing.I have spent much time with him and he has shared more with myself and Malachy than most other peers.This makes it easier to see the areas he is struggling in, and I have felt it necessary to pick these areas out, as many of the other peers may not have been aware of them.Therefore, they may not be mentioned in his other evaluations, only the obvious progress he is making.didn\'t feel I got that much out of the groups this morning, it all seemed to pass by without too much happening inside me.What the first group did do was start me of thinking about my dad and that side of the family.Over the last few years I have thought very little about this, and I wonder if this may have been largely due to my addiction.Today I have had a fair amount of thoughts and emotions about my father.What the psychodrama did do, was make me question who I really am.Emma was told to be the real Emma, just be herself, it made me think who is the real Ashley.I feel that over the last few years I have been putting on a front, being the person my friends want me to be.Maybe I\'ll have to do some searching for the real Ashley, or just let him surface to the top.I\'ll just have to wait and see.Tonight I\'ve written two long letters, and I\'m feeling kind of refreshed because of it.It feels as though I put a lot of my thoughts onto paper which has made them more ordered.Today has been both relaxed and full, and tonight I feel positive.After the psycho-drama today it suddenly dawned on me that by being materialistic can lead to confrontations which in turn can lead to relapses and that by sharing in the hobbies or activities will lead to far better recovery, this I now look forward to and feel positive.The meeting in London was extremely good.It was brilliant to be able to identify with everything which was said and it was a really nice atmosphere.They\'re were plenty of people all of whom were very friendly and its definitely a meeting I will continue to go to.They share by putting the speaker in a chair in the middle of the room.I found this a little nerve-tacking but I did do some sharing.I didn\'t feel as nervous or as vulnerable as I thought I would in London, this was probably because I was with my peers but in some respects it made me feel quite confident.I think its going to be hard to sort out me finances as I\'m not really used to work, but from what was said at the meeting this seems to be the easiest part.When I got back to Promise I got a message to call my girlfriend.I did and it was really depressing, she gave me a really hard time.',4,-5,1,1,5,0,0,0,5.82,0,0,0,0,2.91,0,1.46,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,11.64,0,5.82,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,32.02,0,0,5.82,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male52
'I found the first group with the chocolate eclair episode a little unproductive.There was no real input from the councilors and I felt this led to a disjointed group.Barnaby\'s collage was a different story.I could identify with a lot of his life especially the beginning with the rebelling of school, and the end with the desperation for money.I thought it was an extremely honest collage which covered his life comprehensively, however, I did feel some parts such as his daughter were only touched on briefly and need further looking at.I\'m sure he gained a lot out of it as it seems to have taken the whole night for him to recover.I spoke to my parents tonight and we had a nice chat.However, I feel that they have handled enough pressure from the people I owe money to, and for this reason I decided I would phone up two of the dodgy people I owe money to before they start contacting my parents.I was nervous but I did feel that it was time for me to start taking responsibility.However after talking to a few of the peers I was advised not to rush into it, and have therefore decided to talk to a councilor before making any contact.Quite a good morning.          Thanasi\'s Peer Evaluation was cutting but honest.          Dawn\' Step 1 part 2 was really good.            It brought up so much for me that I could          identify with.          Country Club was a new experience for me which          I enjoyed and will definitely re-visit.          Les\'s life story was a bit ploddy but Daniels\'          was incredible.          I could identify a bit with Daniel\'s but his          story was just so bizarre.          I was encouraged to hear that my step 1 was          acceptable and have found out that my peer evaluation          will probably be next week.          Also I will be having a one-to-one counseling          session with Elizabeth on Monday and so I          finally feel as though the ball is rolling.          So on the whole feeling quite          uplifted, although I am feeling quite hungry          this evening and have had a lot of food          thoughts in the last couple of days.          I think its probably because this week has been          so food oriented.          We had two food `chairs\' at the weekend, three          food Step 1\'s and two foodie life stories all          of which have mentioned food in great detail.          Especially Emma-Jane\'s life story where she          described her mothers cooking immaculately.          Everyone was drooling at the mouth.          Another good thing that happened today was          being allocated Paul\'s buddy.          The responsibility has made me wake up to how          long I have been here.          But is Paul a foodie or a drugie, I was told By          Michael he was a foodie, but he said he was a          drugie, but he then had a plated meal.          Paul wasn\'t happy about it but I\'ll have to ask          tomorrow as I\'m confused about it.          But on the whole I\'m feeling encouraged and          hopeful.Glad to have cleared the air about \"social\" status and hope that all is understood by everyone. Enjoyed \"book writing\" session.Not the most memorable of New Years, but expected that, even though I did not find it easy.Now its 1995 I would like to get on with my program straight away.Some sort of time span would be helpful.Well considering the pace at today I feel fairly calm.After rehearsing my lines at least fifty times I still managed to fluff my line\'s but I must say its been one of the most enjoyable days I\'ve had for a very long time.',3,-3,1,2,5,0,0,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.25,0,16.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.89,0,0,3.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.13,Male52
'Today for me was a bastard of a day. I really felt going hope after talking with my peers and speaking in group the feelings subsided I spoke with my wife she\'s OK but!At the start of the day I was confused at the end I was angry.I\'ve got a very tiresome cold.\"Oh dear, poor little thing\" I can hear you all saying!Otherwise I have had an all right day but am feeling a bit tired.AHHO diddums!!Hopefully I will be on the ball again tomorrow ready for another round with the program.I\'m sure a good night\'s sleep will do the trick.Good nightGregThe day started off with Bob\'s leaving ceremony which was extremely moving.I\'m going to miss him being around so much, and I really am feeling quite sad.I hope he stays in touch and can keep up what he\'s started.Steps 2+3 were quite strange.They don\'t really seemed to have sunk in much and I just wonder whether I expected too much.Then again I think realizing the power of these steps may take a while.After them I did feel quite light and \'fluffy\'.I\'m concerned about my step-dad whose still in intensive care, and I was feeling quite down.After doing some sharing tonight I do feel better now.The start of the day for me was bore until about 9:00 when AL and Me had a walk around that changed my mood completely - I enjoyed the lectures and a good film, plus a game of volleyball.',3,-4,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.43,0,7.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.86,0,22.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,48.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.43,33.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.72,Male52
'After Jo\'s psycho-drama it made me think that perhaps people relapses through the shock of entering the outside world after being protected whilst in treatment. I\'m beginning to feel this way myself perhaps after my Sunday out I will have a better perception I just hope I\'m not becoming institutionalized.Felt very happy and positive again today.          Fourth day in a row, I know it won\'t last.          Sad but happy leaving ceremony for Katie and          Perry.          The room was filled with so much love and          feeling and it was great.          I\'m really beginning to love being here which          is quite worrying.          Les\'s Step 1 was very honest and so good that          he never really got  dangerous situations.          Enjoyed Jack\'s circuit training in the gym          after a good session with Elizabeth and Tatu.          Elizabeth suggested that I try and extend M8,          stay here after my trip to London.          I wasn\'t too sure how work would react.          Range my boss and he was OK about it but he          wants me back in the office by the 19th          December.          I was really very pleased at his reaction.          Everything has been going very well at work and          I\'ve been put on an international Sales Team          which I am really excited about.          Dawn\'s collage brought up a lot for me,          especially around my relationship with Mark and          my mother, but it was very good.          Overall I have had an excellent day with no          food thoughts.          Looking forward to going out to Canterbury          tomorrow with my visitors. Quite a good day today.          Bob\'s leaving ceremony was quite good and          enjoyed the smaller Groups for the Group Goal          sessions.                    Relaxation was good and has left me feeling          drowsy for the rest of the day.          Glad that I have my Step 1 next week.                    Not looking forward to my participation in the          play which I only knew about five minutes ago.It was quite hard to identify with anything in Carol\'s psychodrama today.What I could identify with a little was Jonathan\'s part in it.I pray I haven\'t been anything as cruel as him, and I have never resorted to physical violence.But when Robert started talking about Jonathan dumping his shit on Carol it made me wonder where I\'ve dumped my shit.Over the last two years I\'ve dumped a large proportion of my shit and responsibilities onto my girlfriend and more recently onto my parents.I seemed to have ducked so many problems by sharing them and ultimately almost handing',4,-4,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.32,0,0,0,0,4.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.63,0,4.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.59,0,0,6.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.96,9.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.66,16.32,Male52

I was chatting to Katie today and we both need          to get some bits from Canterbury, but she can          never go on a Monday because of her  with          Graham and so we were wondering if it would be          possible if we could share a cab, with maybe I          or 2 other peers, to Canterbury on Saturday          afternoon?          I need to get some toiletries and a few bits.          Would this be OK?Felt quite low this morning but I think that          was to do with Chiara and Brian leaving.          I hated Thanan\'s Step 1 being changed into a          Process group.          I like Step 1\'s because I like hearing about          people\'s lives and experiences.           Thanasi seems to be taking so much time in          group lately but not doing anything with it.          He\'s pissing me off.          Jake\'s group session was very good and he has          given the nursing station the go ahead for me          to * gym which I am really pleased about.          Process group this afternoon really got to me          because again the whole thing revolved around          Thanasi again.          He even admitted that he relapsed two days          before his leaving ceremony last time he was          here.          How could he sit there in his leaving ceremony          listening to everyone praise how much he had          changed and how well he had done, knowing that          days earlier he was using.          Vanessa\'s speech  was very encouraging for me,          hearing how the program and aftercare was          working for her (especially being a foodie).I feel that the air has cleared somewhat after the process group this morning.However, I don\'t really feel that I got to the root of Tristan\'s outburst and I\'m not totally convinced that something similar will not happen again.It is now taking up very little of my thoughts and for this I am relieved.It has been put in the past.I really enjoyed Lynn\'s psychodrama and I really identified with the scene where she was discussing sending Ryan to boarding school.My mum had exactly the same thoughts and emotions and I can see how hard it must have been for her.This in turn brought on feelings of guilt at how I\'ve turned out, and that she probably made the wrong decision.Whereas, I think she was so brave and unselfish to put my opportunities and future before her own feelings.I love her dearly.I think I\'ve been a little lazy for a lot of today.I haven\'t managed to get a lot of identification, including Dawn\'s step and I think this is largely due to me not really looking for it.It\'s been strange not having Barnaby or Malachy around, and I feel a little detached but to no great extent.I read through all the steps up until step 4 tonight in the 12 steps book.I feel better for doing that.I\'m ready to attack my step 4 and really work at it.I think it\'s going to be a big step for me and I\'m quite excited about it.Just reading those steps tonight has made me feel more relaxed and accepting and I\'m more focused tonight that I have been for a while.I\'m trying to put aside the issues I need to plan for when I leave whilst doing these steps.Tonight I feel at ease and grateful.',4,-4,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.8,0,1.56,0,0,0,0,3.12,3.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,10.92,0,4.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.68,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,0,6.24,0,0,0,7.8,32.76,0,3.12,0,0,1.56,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,0,0,4.68,Male52
'I\'m feeling much happier tonight, my step dad sounds as though he\'s improved a lot and is raring to get out of hospital already.That concerns me in itself as I know he wants to get straight back to work.But I\'ll deal with these things as they arrive.However yesterday did bring up a lot for me and it reminded me of how much I want and need my recovery.On this note my peer evaluation was quite a heavy group.I didn\'t realize quite how much I need to work on, and also how little I\'ve accepted my powerlessness.These are things I will start getting down to, as well as my sharing and asking for help.This is something I do find hard but something I\'m determined to start attacking.I\'m going to go through the evaluations tonight and tomorrow and look more closely what was written as I found it hard to take it all in this morning.Today I\'ve felt positive and hopeful, but also slightly defensive and concerned at a number of vital things I\'m not doing, and also about a debtor which I will talk to a councilor about tomorrow.Today\'s been a wonderful day first was a very good goals group followed by a nice relaxed country club visit after that Maria\'s collage which I found I could identify with so much with what she wants for the future and last but not least Birchington AWE which I always enjoy and will probably visit after treatmentToday seems to have dribbled along without much activity.I had a nice chat with Chiara and I haven\'t been isolating myself at all today.I also enjoyed Robert\'s lecture.Basically I felt it just backed up the way I\'ve been feeling the last few days.That I can\'t use my addiction as an excuse anymore.I want to start leading a normal life, a productive normal life where I take responsibility for my future.I also got something out of the psychodrama, the importance of self esteem and loving yourself.It\'s only with these two that I can make the right decisions in the future.Perhaps I am finally seeing a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel as regards sharing and feelings, even if I have a fair way to go yet.Maybe, some will come to the surface during my collage on Thursday and set the ball rolling.Coming from a family that never discusses its problems I am obviously finding it difficult to break a trend that I have followed all of my life.Otherwise I have had a good day and been in a good mood which I enjoyed.',4,-3,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,2.15,0,0,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,0,0,2.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.44,0,4.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.19,0,0,4.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.15,25.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.15,0,0,8.58,Male52
'I have been quite isolated today for some reason.I haven\'t felt like talking and I\'ve tried to keep away from company.I got a fair amount of feelings in Mel\'s collage, most of which here family orientated.I suppose I realized how lucky I was to have certain things in life, such as family and friends who are going to be there for me when I leave.This gave me a feeling that I have to start working the program harder.Tonight my thoughts are on a phone call I\'m trying to make.I\'ve built myself to have an attitude of honesty, and just tell things as they are.I just called but there was no answer.I really didn\'t think it would be as hard.Today feels as if its been a fairly hollow sort of day.It hasn\'t been a terribly bad day, I\'ve felt chirpy on numerous occasions, its just felt hollow.The psychodrama wasn\'t bad although I couldn\'t relate to it much, it was only good because I could see it was really giving someone a much clearer view of their objectives.I really enjoyed John\'s speech but immediately afterwards I felt quite shit.There were loads of great pointers in it, although I felt it didn\'t really apply to me yet.I don\'t feel as though anything\'s really clicked in me.I still have patches of feeling sorry for myself and getting confused in my own thoughts.Lately I don\'t know how I really feel.Today was another fairly positive affair.I managed to get some part time (waiting + washing up) work for when I leave and my recovery plan sorted.The accommodation\'s still up in the air a little but I do have options.As I said I feel positive with spurts of fear.For example organizing work from here\'s fine, but actually doing it and attempting not to look upon it as a nightmare is a different thing.I suppose I just need to get on with it.Another problem is that I had organized to see Chiara tomorrow, but I now need to cancel.I was going to make up an excuse, but I think I\'ll just tell the truth.I\'m really looking forward to going to London tomorrow and have the security of returning here and hope I\'ll gain from it.I\'m quite nervous about leaving (hopefully about Tuesday) but this will prepare me a little more.This morning\'s lecture was good and was pleased          to find out that I don\'t have to abstain from          anything that didn\'t show up on my cross          addiction analysis sheet.           Also a little clearer about finding my own          abstinence.          Process group was quite an eventful one and I          think it shocked a few people.                    Spent all afternoon writing my step four in          preparation for my step 5 on Monday.          It was very hard and has made me realize a few          things about my past that I was still hanging          on to.                    Jo\'s strip search ordeal was unbelievable and I          understand that this is now a new practice that          everyone has to go through which I find          ridiculous, especially checking her bra,          hair band and contents of her mouth.          Looking forward to feeling good again tomorrow          and going out to lunch with my visitors.          Also looking forward to going to Canterbury          Cathedral tomorrow night.

'It will be sad to see Alice and Justine go tomorrow - but none the less very encouraging as they both look so well and happy.\"The sausage machine must go on!\"I have had a good day and ma still feeling positive and very settled.Robert\'s group was OK.It just re-affirmed to me that I have to stop doing my head in with \'should\' or \'meant to\'.However I also mentioned today that I\'ve begun not looking at issues altogether and just been \'bubbling\' along.I need to find the balance between projecting and the above, and planning which needs to be done, as I have a lot of fears of the future.Again today I feel I\'ve let out a lot of anger but in the wrong channels.I\'m confused at how to address this.My girlfriend has said she can come down on Monday for a meeting with Amanda, so I hope I can get some things sorted out then.I feel anxious tonight and feel I have a lot to organize yet I don\'t know where to start.I hope the fireworks tonight can relax my mind a little.I\'ve felt extremely confused today, confused because I haven\'t been able to put much order to my thoughts, they seem to have been dancing all over the place.I found Robert\'s lecture extremely interesting, I found the concept of replacing the missing link to a normal life from addiction to recovery a comforting one.It makes more sense of what recoveries for, its simplicity makes it manageable.Ryan seems so similar to my little brother its uncanny, and it left me with a few more ideas on how exactly I\'m going to approach treating him.As for me I\'m feeling quite relaxed tonight although, as I said earlier, at times today has been confusing.At times my brain just seems to overflow with input and I find it quite hard to decipher exactly how is the best way to approach the program, and I always think I\'m forgetting some part of it.I suppose I shouldn\'t be looking at the program as a whole, but \'one day at a time\'.Also I find it hard to work out exactly how well I\'m doing.I try to stand back to take my itinerary and sometimes I feel I have changed and I am thinking slightly differently, and other times I doubt myself and feel I haven\'t made any real progress.I hope this isn\'t the case, and again I suppose I should just take it one day at a time.I was annoyed at myself for the first half of the day.I felt I had feelings arisen yesterday and yet today I felt they had sank back down.I admitted after Malachi\'s step 1 (which I thought was brilliant), that my step 1 had little benefits as it was more of a story telling exhibition.I realized after feedback that I trivialized events to a very large extent, probably as I had my defenses up.I was pissed off this morning as yesterday I felt I had them lowered and yet here they are straight back up.When they\'re up I tend to just bubble along putting very little thought into anything.My emotions started to stir again this afternoon, during Lynn\'s collage.At first it had very little effect on me, then I had two thoughts.Firstly it could have been my girlfriend standing there in Lynn\'s position being told that she couldn\'t give me any more help, and that she had to make a break from me.I couldn\'t begrudge her, fucking hell she puts up with enough from me.Secondly, when Lynn talked about putting everything into Ryan, it makes me think how much my mums put into me.How much care, support and love she\'s given me in her life, not pushed it on me, just always been there for me.Look what she\'s got out of it, a lying, cheating, deceiver of a son.She deserves to have the real Ashley back just as much as I do.At this stage I became rather isolated, just recycling feelings around my head.What then began to frustrate me was trying to work out those feelings.Was I feeling pain and real loving feelings for these people, or was it just feeling self bloody pity?I\'m still not sure of the answer to this.Tonight I had a phone call with my mother and it was a wonderful call.She was taken aback by how genuinely caring and supportive my friends at home are.I have not only amazingly caring parents, sister, girlfriend, but friends as well.After the trail of devastation I\'ve caused I\'m both blessed and very probably undeserved of these people, who only want to see my recovery.I owe my recovery to both them and to myself, to put the past in the past and let the real me come out and pay back the affection I\'ve received.To do this I can\'t isolate but stay positive and start taking responsibility.Most of all I have to start getting my feelings out which, no matter how painful, I desperately want to let out.So much I want to touch the feelings I should have been having over the last two years.I find it so hard at the moment to get to them though, I feel so cold and hard on my exterior, but they must be there somewhere.',4,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.23,0,0,6.35,0,4.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.17,0,0,2.12,0,8.47,2.12,0,0,0,4.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.58,0,9.52,0,0,4.23,0,4.23,0,52.92,0,0,2.12,0,0,0,0,0,4.23,0,0,0,0,0,17.99,24.34,0,6.35,0,0,4.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.17,0,0,2.12,Male52
'This morning seemed to pass by, Sean\'s peer evaluation was honest and I hope he got something out of it.The play practice at lunch was pretty good as well and it looks like its going to be quite a laugh.Marcus\'s step 1 was extremely powerful and really got feelings going inside me.I felt it could have been me sitting in his position, it seemed so similar to my step 1 with the feelings starting to come out but not fully.I\'m really concerned that he\'ll take it easy now, he must keep sharing.For me, there was an enormous amount of identification there and as I said earlier it really moved things inside me.I felt good about this as it feels like progress.However at the same time it scared me.It made me realize that since my step 1 I haven\'t really touched on many of the past events, as I haven\'t felt like I did today since then.This shows me that I have a lot of sharing to do, so that I don\'t leave with many things not discussed.I\'m going to try and arrange a mini-group with some peers.I thought this mornings Process Group (although maybe a bit heated) was a good idea.With the house being so full I think it was necessary to get the basic house rules straightened out again, because, as you rightly said, they had definitely begun to slip.I was so pleased to see that Lesley made the right decision and decided not to leave as this would have been a shame.I am otherwise perfectly happy and enjoying my continued treatment.Malachy\'s peer evaluation was a very honest affair, and I think he gained much from it.The process group was extremely emotional, however mine seemed to be taking a time-out as they\'ve been working quite hard of late.Today I\'ve felt positive, grateful and hopeful for the future.I\'ve been doing lots of sports and I feel good within myself.The fireworks tonight was great fun and felt very refreshing.I\'m really surprised at how much of a good time I had doing something  which before I would have thought of as both boring and certainly would not have bothered',3,-5,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.83,0,0,5.8,0,0,0,0,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.97,0,18.36,0,3.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.86,0,3.86,0,4.83,11.59,0,2.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.9,Male52
'Today for me was very rewarding watching Robert\'s psycho-Drama and family lecture, it was wonderful to see my wife looking so good in the face of her disease I felt quite  sad to see her leave I really enjoyed today.The morning after the night before.          Woke feeling very positive and happy about the          family session the night before.          We talked for hours in the restaurant in          Canterbury and it was the most we had talked          for ages.          Even though the last 6 years haven\'t been bad,          we\'re going to put those behind us and look          forward to the future because without my          compulsive behavior things will be so much          better.          I must have been a shit to live with over the          past few years.                    Robert\'s lecture about \"higher power\" was good;          I was beginning to wonder if I\'d ever find mine          as I wasn\'t a deeply religious person, but now          feel a lot more relaxed about it.                    The group was good, although it turned into a          discussion on AIDS, which isn\'t a bad thing.          I agree  with Robert and there is a great myth          surrounding Aids and it is relatively difficult          to contract heterosexually and even through          homosexual sex has a far greater chance of          contracting the virus, it\'s only through          unprotected anal intercourse.          The whole discussion made me quite thoughtful          as Elizabeth had suggested the night before, at          the family session, that I temporarily give u[          my buddy for the THT of 3/4 months or so and          spend time helping myself rather than others.                    Had a fairly only brisk walk this afternoon and          as I returned I could feel a headache coming          on.          After a confrontation with Stephen about his          drinking of low-alcohol lager at the post          office, my headache got worse and so I relaxed          in the lounge.                    Dinner was called but after a couple of bites I          felt quite sick and so didn\'t eat anymore and          went upstairs to lie down.          It was a real killer of a headache.          Jan the nurse kept checking, every hour or so,          if I was OK and she mentioned that I had missed          all of the commotion with Stephen and Daniel.          It didn\'t surprise me though, I actually felt          like hitting him this afternoon when he told me          to mind my own business and followed it up by          saying that if I\'d brought something to eat          from the shop, he wouldn\'t say anything.          I told him he was fucking warped!I felt quite frustrated at myself today.I haven\'t been sharing much recently although there has been a lot going on for me.I seem to have been occupying my mind with menial things, possibly in an attempt to deflect from these issues.I had a hard phone call from my girlfriend tonight, she was in bits and I suddenly felt it was all to much for me.Her problems, the problems at home and me trying to get my recovery at times it really does all seem to much.However, at least this phone call did push me to share and I do feel better as I\'ve now managed to get a lot of stuff out.It\'s been a confusing, up and down day, but I feel I\'m just about holding myself together, just!I am looking forward to steps 2+3.Goals group today was fairly productive.Everyone was set apt goals and there was some good feedback.My goal for the week is \" Don\'t trivialize or isolate but share my feelings with all the group \".I\'ve tried to start carrying out the goals today, and I\'ve already shared with peers I don\'t normally do so and I\'ve been careful not to isolate.Tonight I\'m feeling positive as I\'m quite pleased with the way my step 1 went.At first I felt it was going the same way as my first part where I was tending to storytell and trivialize.This is the point where I started to become frustrated about my blunted feelings.However, after this I felt Amanda drew a lot of stuff out that I wanted to get out.Here, I actually started to become fairly emotional.I don\'t know where from, but the emotions certainly felt as though they had come a little.I know this is only the tip of the iceberg, but I\'m left tonight feeling very positive and I\'ll let my feelings come as they come and not try to force them up.',4,-5,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.1,0,0,0,0,5.24,0,0,0,17.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.24,3.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.24,0,0,3.93,Male52
'Woke feeling very lonely and depressed this          morning.          A very disjointed morning didn\'t help either.          I\'ve done a lot of work today on my Step 1 and          am feeling quite positive about it.          I want to get it out of the way to see if I          feel any better about myself being here          afterwards.          Marcus\'s Collage was excellent.          I couldn\'t find any similarities but it was          certainly very powerful and sincere.          I shared in the OA meeting for about 15 minutes          about how low I\'m feeling and expressing my          doubts and I seemed to start the ball rolling.          Everyone was so sad and emotional.          Hopefully I\'ll feel better tomorrow.I had a quiet day.I looked through my step 4 this evening and there is plenty of food for thought there!I shall tackle it this weekend.I\'ve had a relaxing evening watching television otherwise and plan on getting an early night.No other thoughts to tell you this evening.See you tomorrow.I got a lot from Rebecca\'s step 1.Being away from gambling and it being discussed so little, I don\'t have the urge to use.Listening to Rebecca I remembered the pre-occupation I had with it from when I woke up until when I slept.It reminded me of a lot of things I\'ve done and just how hard it\'s going to be when I leave.I\'m quite confused at the moment about the program and how I\'m progressing.I\'m worried about my plans for when I leave and the things facing me.I\'m really looking forward to steps 2+3 tomorrow and hoping they\'ll fill in some of the gaps I feel are present at the moment.I\'m extremely sad to see Bob leaving, he was one of the first people I met and I really care about him, the sweetie.Tonight\'s church service was very inspiring give\'s me great strength.The lecture gave my wife a life.We enjoyed a trip to the bird park in Wingham although there was tension at first but it seemed that after about one hour things improved by the end of the day we both had a good day.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.36,0,5.36,0,16.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.12,0,8.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.56,0,0,8.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,Male52
'Firstly, I enjoyed Robert\'s video this morning.I liked the idea of likening my disease to a parasite, a parasite making my decisions for me.Then there was Robert\'s group I had mixed emotions here, I liked the psychodrama as I know the things I\'d like to have in my life, and I pray my recovery is strong enough to counter - balance my addiction.However the Rania affair was a little upsetting, in the sense that she seemed to give up so easily after being confronted.What really shocked me though, was the sudden departure of Julie.I had no prior knowledge of her intentions to leave, and before I knew it I was saying my farewells on the doorstep.I\'ll miss Julie loads, and I just hope so much that everything works out well for her.Besides these events, I\'m feeling really good. I feel I\'m relaxing into the program and I\'m extremely hopeful.Today has been fairly relaxed and I\'ve just taken things easy.I did get a fair amount of identification from Marcus\'s collage but it didn\'t bring up that much for me.I had a good chat with Amanda and I\'m hoping that Wednesday will be beneficial both to my girlfriend and myself.Tonight I\'ve been fairly relaxed although I\'m concerned that I\'m not sharing enough.I need to start some constructive planning for my future soon, and share more of my fears about it.Its nice to be nice that\'s just how I feel in the past.I\'ve been selfish self-centered its just good to start being pleasant for my own satisfactionI enjoyed today and think that you managed very well considering how many people there were here to deal with.I am continuing to do battle with my step 4 but am finding it very exhausting mentally.There is a lot of thinking involved in digging out all  of those memories.I am finding it particularly difficult to remember specific examples for the various different groups of questions but hope that I am stirring up the right sort of things.I am still feeling positive and am ready for another day.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.36,0,0,0,0,5.36,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.04,0,18.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.89,0,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.85,5.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.36,Male52
'Not a great deal to report today.I felt fairly lethargic for most of the day but picked up in the evening.Just one of those days I suppose.I am ready for my Relapse Step one tomorrow and hope to be a lot more lively.The gym is definitely helping me get rid of the unfortunate side- effects of years of boozing - don\'t worry I am not becoming a compulsive over exerciser!!Otherwise I am well.Today psycho-drama was very moving it raised feelings in me of my own childhood in which harsh punishment was dished out for minor incidents usually by my grandfather.I had a good visit, plenty of walking which I enjoyed.I\'ve found it much easier to get in touch with my feelings now I\'ve finished the prozac.I\'ve managed to come to a compromise in my relationship with my wife regarding hobbies and spare time, this I think will avoid confrontations and lead to a better recovery.Today for me was good, I enjoyed the video and Ken\'s lecture.As the day progressed it got better with time spent at the country club and finally the Dover meeting giving me a lift all in all a great day.Tonight was interesting, I enjoyed the visit to AA plus the chance to go outside it took some of the claustrophobic feelings.I got a valentine\'s card from the wife nice to know she still love\'s me after all the crap.All in all a great day.',3,-3,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.75,0,0,3.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.26,0,7.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.27,0,0,23.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.63,Male52
'I\'ve been projecting a fair amount today and I\'m in quite a lot of confusion about my girlfriend.When I first came in and heard about relationships really changing post-addiction I didn\'t take it in, as I didn\'t think it affected me.Now I\'m starting to wonder, and to be honest I don\'t like it.I owe my girlfriend so much, and I don\'t like questioning my feelings toward her.Apart from that I\'ve been fairly happy today and I\'ve enjoyed the groups, as I feel they\'ve all been quite productive.Especially Sean\'s, in which I could identify with a hell of alot.It brought up many things that have happened over the last couple of years, and the feelings that go with them.I also thought it was a big step for him, as he seemed really honest, and the feelings he was talking about today, I could see he was really feeling.Which I don\'t think he\'s been doing up until now.I did think the process group was rather unproductive though.Wendy\'s roll play today was very moving and I thought she was very strong to go the whole way through with it.I hope she benefits from it and that it gets the \"emotional\" ball rolling for her.I have had a pretty dull day but am OKI hope tomorrow will be more inspiring.I received an immense satisfaction in sharing my life story this morning just to be honest and open about anything over the last few years, and sharing my recent past was like sharing a burden.I also received a lot of identification which I feels brings me closer to the group.I was given my step 1 today which I\'m extremely pleased about.I\'ve found that in such a secure and overall happy environment, although I\'ve been able to get amongst other peoples feelings, mine have been hard to find.I\'ve even lost touch with the ones I came in with and I\'m hoping the step 1 will drag them back up no matter how bad.However, I am pleased that I\'m questioning less and less the basis of the program and the manner in which to approach it.I feel more able now to flow with it.HALT why am I hungry its because I\'m on a diet, why am I angry its because I haven\'t been given a leaving date, why am I lonely its because I prefer it that way, why am I tired its because its ten o\'clock why do I feel so good its because I haven\'t used.',4,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,0,4.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,0,0,0,0,4.42,0,11.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,30.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.04,Male52
'I had a good day today.  My visit by my parents  was not at all heavy, which I thought it might be.In fact, quite the opposite.They found the video on \"the Family illness\" very interesting and helpful and we then had a good chat about the general goings on at Promis.Otherwise not a lot to report, but I am feeling fighting fit, ready to tackle next week and whatever it may bring.Very grateful to be back at Promis after 3          nights out in the big bad world.          Food issues were OK but I\'m now left feeling          very exposed and stripped, especially around          work issues.          I hated work and wanted to run straight back to          Promis.          If there\'s a process group tomorrow I will          definitely take time.          Very tired this evening but am worried about          leaving next Friday.          Is this too soon?          I don\'t know, but I feel so inadequate and          insecure at work.          I\'m going to have to address it.          Goal\'s Group pissed me off as I am not an          alcoholic. I\'ve been feeling positive today.I started getting a few things done like phoning my bank and making financial arrangements, and it gave me a sense of achievement just doing things, rather that procrastinating as I usually do.It made me feel that if I look at things that would usually be hassles in the right way, it could be quite nice to actually do them.This includes flat-hunting, job-hunting.Today I\'ve tried to look at all the things I have to look forward to and the life it will be possible to have.Quite often negative thoughts start entering my head and it all seems like hard work.At these times I\'m trying to stop projecting.I\'m quite nervous about leaving Promise, and I was quite sad at the thought of leaving my peers, and such a safe place.I spoke to Juliet and I know how hard its going to be at times I hope I can implement what I\'ve learnt.I feel its vital for me when I leave, to get out and start doing things.Find work and hobbies, socialize and just experience how life can be, I have fears about returning to my lazy pessimistic lifestyle.I\'ve enjoyed half of the day the bit with the lecture and the process group.The other half should have been canceled basically because of a row on the telephone over finance.It made me angry this after feeling happy before that I was sad so its been quite a day the main thing is I didn\'t want to use.',3,-4,0,1,5,4.47,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,8.95,0,0,0,6.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0,0,0,42.5,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,62.63,0,0,15.65,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,13.43,20.13,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.71,Male52
'I enjoyed my Step 1 it made me feel comfortable and relaxed afterwards and I\'m now looking forward the next step\'s today seemed quite a short one I\'d day its been a good day I would like to come off the Prozac while in treatment.Process group was fairly uneventful but          Malachy\'s psychodrama was unbelievable.          As previously mentioned, I don\'t understand why          the counselors make someone go through so much           pain.          Is it really necessary?          Feeling quite low and skeptical as my visitors          arrived.          I think it\'s a bit much to make a visitor  give          up an hour to sit in on a lecture after just          having driven for two hours.          It cuts the visiting time to a third.          My mother and Steve asked me what progress I          had made and I found that quite difficult to          answer which was frightening.          I guess not much at all.          Apart from not knowing what abstinence is and a          little about overeaters anonymous, no much at          all.          I am really frustrated at the lack of progress          I have made but how can I go forward when I\'m          having doubts about being here?                    As a last ditch attempt to involve myself more          with the program, I\'ve told them that I don\'t          want them to visit me anymore.          I find that I get pre-occupied with what Steve          is doing and am now worried about my mother who          has just sold the family home and is trying to          co-ordinate a fairly complex move on her own.          As her only child I feel duly bound to be there          helping.                    I\'m finding it desperately difficult to share          this pain that everyone is talking about as a          result am becoming very quiet and          introspective.          Mom expressed concern about how much I had          changed and how quiet I was.          This was another reason for saying I was too          busy to see them because not only are they          giving up their Sunday\'s they are also worrying          about me which  I don\'t want as it sends me on          a guilt trip.          Normally everyone in my family etc          relies/depends on me and now I\'m the one          wanting help and it\'s NOT EASY.Enjoyed seeing my wife today, although I am starting to miss her ever increasingly.I felt it as a productive group this morning, however, I do find it difficult to understand food disorders.  I am trying to get to grips with this.Now the New Year has begun I am ready to give the job at hand a good crack.All in all a real fuck off day today.          This morning process group was about the          highlight of my day.          Psychodrama was just so spot on for me and has          really got me thinking about my sexuality and          the fact that I have to accept what I am as I          will never be able to change it.          Paul played me and it was so exact as this is          something that we have talked about in great          lengths.          He played me well and it made me feel so sorry          for myself as I came across as being so sad and          ashamed of what I am.          Psychodrama really brought me down and then my          friend who was supposed to meet me for lunch          didn\'t show up.          I waited until the video  and then gave up on          him and so this brought me down even further.          Church was quite good this evening but Richard          pissed me off.          He didn\'t really want to got to church but just          get into Canterbury so that he could use the          cash machine and get some cigarettes.                    Found Paul\'s Peer evaluation very difficult indeed          but feel happy with the end result.                    Step 5 tomorrow and then family visit and then          the Cathedral.          Hope I don\'t get any more Peer evaluations to do as          I\'ve also got my collage to do after my Step 5.          I haven\'t got any decent material for it and so          am hoping that I will be allowed out at some          stage to get some.

'Shared a great deal with Paul, my room mate,          last night which was really good but he never          shares himself; he only gives me a good ear to          talk to and gives good advice and support.          Very sad that Dawn has left; I can\'t believe          it.          She became a very close friend in here and we          are going to go to all the OA meetings together          as she only lives 5 minutes drive away.          We always shared and supported each other so          much and I will miss her greatly.          Les\'s Step 1 and Sheila\'s Peer evaluation were          both very good indeed.          Despite all these positive things I\'m feeling          quite low this evening.          There seems to be a real atmosphere in the          house tonight and I was just joking around with          Justine, as I have done on many occasions, and          she started shouting at me about her sugar          levels and then ran upstairs.          Everyone seems to be really tense this evening.                    I\'ve got to complete my step 4 tomorrow for          Monday as I\'ve got visitors on Sunday.          Looking forward to Robert\'s groups tomorrow and          hope that everyone calms down and is less          temperamental. Jo\'s step 1 really unsettled me this morning          knowing that I could possibly be having  mine          later today or even tomorrow.          I had mine planned, as I\'m sure Jo did but I          began to get worried after hers didn\'t quite go          according to plan.          She seemed to be so defensive of some of her          past activities that I wondered if I would          react the same way under the pressure of          questioning by counselors.          I was worrying about this all through lunch and          so decided to use the gym this afternoon to          calm down.          Dawn joined me in the gym and we ran through a          few circuits as learned with Jack last Friday.          I felt so much better after a good hour work          out.          I showered then came and felt very relaxed.The lecture by Robert on anxiety was the highlight of the day apart from that a walk to the post office it was boring although I managed to stay in a good mood.Felt quite nervous this morning with the          thought of Step 5 and a family visit today.          Paul\'s\' peer evaluation was constructive and I          really hope that he takes it all in and gets          something out of it.          Step 5 was great! It didn\'t take the format          that I thought it would and I didn\'t refer to          any of my Step 4 work at all.          However it took on a different route, but still          I managed to dump loads of stuff.           It seems, apart from my sexuality, that          everything stems back to my first relationship          with Mark.          I now realize that the relationship was very          destructive and I really ant to put it all          behind me now.          The high I received from my Step 5 was          unfortunately short lived as I found Steve          having a go at Elizabeth for being late.          I thought this was very rude of him and I felt          very embarrassed.          As a result of his wait he was very irritable          and in a bad mood and was quite negative in the          seminar.          This was such a shame as the first session was so          productive and the second quite negative.          This took the edge off my day and for that I          was annoyed.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,3.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,0,0,0,10.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.25,0,7.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.62,0,0,17.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,0,3.53,12.37,0,3.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male52
'It was a very busy day considering its Saturday I must say I enjoyed Robert\'s lecture.Writing letters washing clothes preparing scenes for the play followed by a game of chess who says treatment is boring.I\'m tired shattered and desperately want a fag.To me it\'s a big decision to give up smoking and it\'s going to be bloody hard, at least I have Chiara to beat my head against the wall with.Apart from that, not too much seems to have happened today.The counselors are back and I\'m sure in time I\'ll get to meet them properly.I\'m still confused about the program and worried I won\'t put enough in to it.I\'m having to face the reality that it might not just go (gambling) at the first attempt, although to be honest, I can\'t face that.I can see from people who have been here a number of weeks that things will slowly click into place, I suppose I just want it to happen.Enjoyed Ken\'s group this morning.Sarah\'s life story very interesting and good identification with Alisson\'s Step One.I am feeling confident and waiting to do my Step One.Maybe over exercised in Mr. Motivator this afternoon!Very sad to lose my room mate Paul today.          He was a very good friend and spend many nights          talking into the early hours of the morning.          We will definitely keep in touch.          Steps 2 & 3 were really nice to do today and I          felt like I really understood what everything          was about.          They have given me a lot more hope and          encouragement for the future and I\'m pleased to          be given my Step 4.          Pissed off about temporarily sharing a room          with Jorge tonight.          I want to stay in my room and have a new room          mate; not Stephen or Jorge but hopefully Paul          II as we get on very well.          Beginning to worry about going home.

'Last night\'s massage must still be taking          effect because I\'m feeling extremely calm and          serene.          Dawn\'s Step 1 was brilliant because I          identified so much with pretty much everything          that she said apart from the laxatives.          It was quite for me as it was the first food          Step 1 that I have heard since being here.           Found out that I have to do my Step 1 on          Tuesday 8th.          Pippa\'s collage was good but I couldn\'t relate          to any of it.          OA meeting was good as usual.          I prefer our meetings more than any others.          I\'m sorry that Maria\'s leaving but most of all          Malachy  next week.          Malachy and I have shared quite a lot over the          past 12 days and we will definitely keep in          contact but I will be sorry to see him go as we          have quite a lot in common.Finally arrived, after 4-6 weeks of constantly          worrying and thinking about Promis, I\'m          actually here.                    Everything feels very strange and cold and yet          everyone appears to be so warm and friendly.                    After watching my relatives drive off, I          remember feeling totally isolated and low,          wondering how I had let everything go on for so          long and letting it go so far.                    Feeling very nervous for tomorrow.I feel as though I\'m going nowhere which in a way is a positive test of my resolve.I feel confident I would not use in this mood.I\'ve also had pressure feelings and again did not feel like using.In the past these two moods would have been the trigger to use.Confused with the drink issue.          I\'ve never ever felt that I have the need to          justify or control my drinking.          It\'s  never been an issue for me, I\'ve never          worried about it and it really wouldn\'t bother          me if I didn\'t drink again.          However, I do enjoy a drink occasionally and my          current preoccupation with alcohol has been          planted by the counselors.          Other than that, a fairly good day and quite          looking forward to my trip home, but a little          scared.          Felt very very full this evening and wish that          I hadn\'t eaten everything.          I know that I am supposed to but surely it\'s          better to stop when I feel full?          This is really weird as I\'ve always found it          really difficult to leave anything on my plate          but I\'m now feeling full with a normal size          meal.          Maybe I\'m getting there.

'I had a good day again today. I could identify with the chair at the AA meeting this evening but had none the less heard the same tale of woe before.That\'s it.On the whole quite a good day.            I enjoyed Paul\'s and Justine\'s life story very          much.          No food thoughts until the cheese arrived which          really screwed me up.          I tend to binge on savory things rather than          sweet things and cheese is a favorite.          I had to push the trolley with the cheese on          into the kitchen and it was a real battle to          stop myself from taking some cheese.          Don\'t worry, abstinence won in the end but it          wasn\'t easy.          Felt quite depressed this evening for no          apparent reason but the massage has left me          feeling very relaxed and sleepy so this is all          I\'m writing.I\'m trying to get my step 1 together tonight and I am a little nervous.I feel as though I have accepted powerlessness, although I\'m not sure whether or not I\'m kidding myself.No doubt tomorrow will tell.Today just seemed to whip along, I did enjoy the process group though.It felt as though some real feelings came out here, you can\'t really fake anger.Apart from that my feelings have been reasonably docile today.The only other point of interest today for me, was that I was told by a peer that I have a front or a mask.I\'m not sure how I feel about this.I really don\'t believe I put on a front, but then again I wouldn\'t see it.I\'m intrigued to find out whether or not I do, and if I do whether I can drop it.I\'ve discovered five words which will be my motto in recovery they are on page 132 of the big book, 16 lines down and 16 lines up 2 words in from either side these words are ( We Absolutely Insist on Enjoying Life) I feel good in abstinence and will use these words to stay this way.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,5.71,0,0,0,0,5.71,0,0,0,11.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.71,5.71,0,0,17.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.98,0,0,22.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.42,14.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.29,Male52
'A bit tired today for some reason.Goals group went well and have now been set a goal to aim for fro the next  fortnight.Went to an AA meeting this evening in Birchington.I found this completely different from the meetings I attend in London and of little benefit.I dare say that this is due to country meetings being a great deal smaller.I also found it difficult to identify with the people attending it.I had a lot of identification with Wendy\'s peer Evaluation and have discussed this with her out of group.I enjoyed a good walk this afternoon and had a chat with Paul and Peter about our drug dependencies, and their similarities.Spent an hour in the gym trying to regain my fitness after years of debauchery!Pretty good again today but a bit thoughtful          about going back home and to work this coming          weekend.           Very sad to see Mel leave this morning but I am          meeting her on Monday evening at Clapham OA          meeting.          George took all his criticisms well this          morning in his peer evaluation, which wasn\'t          surprising seeing that he was sitting reading          them all late last night.          The interview with South East news started          immediately after lunch and carried on until          4.00 PM; 3 hours of solid chatter and then          straight into Alice\'s step 1 which was very          honest and brought up a lot for me.          Good chat with Elizabeth this afternoon and we          covered a lot of ground.          Good reunion in the gym this afternoon before          dinner.          Speaking to Rebecca tonight and she\'s being          picked up by friends on Saturday afternoon and          she has offered to take me back to London with          them.          Will check with Elizabeth tomorrow if that\'s          OK. Its been a strange day.I woke up this morning feeling very nervous and anxious.This continued in the group and in the psycho-drama I felt really rough getting hot flushes.All the time I felt like I had butterflies in my stomach.Tonight I have an extremely sore throat.This meant I couldn\'t really concentrate in the groups and gained little from them.The rest of the day I\'ve been really frightened.Scared of what faces me out there, I\'ve heard from Juliette and Malachy and they were basically saying how hard it was and that scares me.However, I then spoke to my girlfriend and she reminded me I have many reasons to be optimistic and lots to look forward to, so I\'ve decided I\'m going to be optimistic.I feel I need more time before my step 5, and I feel concerned about my lack of living arrangements.A big issue though was finding out that Barnaby used.It was a REAL shock.I\'ve had a long chat with him and it was all justification.However, I think he is starting to realize what he\'s done and the possible consequences.I still have faith in him and pray that he\'ll pull through.Personally I just feel very angry at his addiction, really angry at its power and its grip.That after 10 weeks in treatment it can get him the second he walks out the gates.It\'s made me all the more determined that I WILL get my recovery, and I won\'t let this FUCKER beat me.It was great to see that Paul is doing so well and enjoying life.Martine and I are feeling a lot more confident about the future and our meeting with Titus was a great help.We had a good afternoon together and, are now looking forward to getting things sorted out again which will make a very nice and overdue change!See you tomorrow.',3,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,3.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.79,0,28.74,0,6.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.51,0,0,6.38,0,3.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.39,12.77,6.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.19,Male52
'I feel so down tonight went to an AA meeting it was terrible I just want to cry all the time.I think I am so homesick now.I just want to be home and have my teeth put all right they hurt so much.We all went for a walk the fresh air did me good.Julie and Mel say they are fed up may be that\'s why I feel so bad.Bob is very worried about his step one I have tried to help him but he makes me laugh when I should be serious.Posted cards and had lots of mail today.Rania life story was in two parts for some reason.Emma\'s peer evaluation was very fair.Hope Mel will stay.Today I woke up and didn\'t feel up or down and          I wasn\'t worried about it.          I suddenly thought is this what it is like to          feel normal?                    Richard\'s Step 1 really touched a nerve and I          not sure really why.          I think it may be that I\'m terrified that I may          end up swapping my addiction after I leave          here.          I used to fantasize about taking heroin before          I came here and I can see what it does to          people but it still doesn\'t give me the healthy          respect that I know I should have.          I know that I have a lot to loose but don\'t know          if I really care.                    Lesley\'s Step 1 could of identify with a lot          and it was on the tip of my tongue but it just          never came out so I now feel angry and          frustrated with myself.          I got my step 2-3 today and I now feel a bit          panicky that my time is running out.          I don\'t feel any different from when I arrived          nearly 9 weeks later.          I have felt my mood slipping lower and lower          and I now feel pretty hopeless.          I don\'t know what the point of it all is.          I can\'t see any light at the end of the tunnel.          Things feel pretty bleak.          May be I got PMT.          I know that I\'m very tired.          I shall go to bed and have a good nights sleep          and feel better in the morning.I hope that I can write everything in this event sheet and it is confidential as I have been terrible at gossiping as I wanted to be accepted by people.!Hate my body, specially as the sun has come out and I feel envious of some women here and wish I could hide myself, also feel that people are fare more open and careless.Feeling envy watching Ioli and Roland body language, but always know that they can identify more over some things, but it makes me feel as an third part and that I am always the left out, but it is so painful to watch that I feel like leaving and to and lose 10 kgs on my way.Had cravings for nurture and love.Don\'t know if I can handle those horrible jealousy feelings.Went for a very long walk with Jackie and Nick, Fenella, felt my HP was the light and color surrounding us.Today has been good.                    Ken\'s group was interesting and it made a          change from the norm.          It is amazing how answering a few questions          seems to reveal so much about one\'s self.                    Had a nice afternoon with Paul and it is good          to know that there can be an abstinent          life out there once we leave promis.                    I haven\'t had any bad cravings today but I do          seem to look forward to my next meal as soon as          I have finished the last one.          In fact I feel a bit disappointed once it is          over.          I don\'t know if this normal but it\'s the way I          feel at the moment .          Maybe I should try to stop it?           What do you think?',3,-5,0,1,5,4.53,9.05,0,0,0,0,3.02,3.02,0,0,6.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.02,0,0,0,9.05,9.05,0,0,12.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.02,48.29,0,6.03,0,0,3.02,0,6.03,0,63.37,0,0,9.05,0,0,0,1.51,0,9.05,0,0,0,0,0,19.62,15.08,0,0,0,0,12.07,0,0,1.51,0,0,0,0,1.51,0,0,0,Female52
'I had been feeling a bit crapy today but I did enjoy Robert\'s          group, I didn\'t think he was going to say anything to my about the          hep, I just didn\'t want to say anything about it I am so pleased          that I was able to say as much as I did I think I shocked myself          as I started to feel very angry again about having it and the way          I was treated with it, I felt so much better after, at the time          I felt very exposed in the group also it seemed that everybody          had moved their chairs about 2 foot into the room anyway I am          glad I have done it.          I was very sad about Julie leaving, I had got quite close to her,          I did talk to her and asked her to stay a bit longer but she had          made her mind up and nothing would change it.I\'m a bit disappointed by my life story - I feel relieved but a     bit flat.     I read it too quickly.     Worried about the exercise in \'trust games\' with Rupert - I didn\'t     make eye contact I realize how untrusting I am with people, how     well guarded I am and it makes me think I\'ve got a long way to     go and yet another problem - relating to people.     I know its from layers and layers of hurt  that I must get in     touch with that.A very strange day.It was 24 years ago today I got married.Today was really the anniversary which I have not been drunk.I was trying very hard to remember what it was like before I got married.All I can show for it is I am getting older fat and still paying out more money to Jonothan and Julia and Alastair.I rang Alastair this morning because I was told he is going back to college and I wanted to know what subjects he was going to do.He said fuck off you bitch aren\'t you dead yet.And then would I send him some money.Amber had told them I was still away.Then the group all day.I just wanted to die today.Then the dentist who gave me two injections only to say she could not do anything she tried to take a tooth out but the injections did not work so she told me to go to Guy\'s next week.Then I could not eat my dinner this Evening because my mouth was hurting.And still everyone went mad in the kitchen first meal I have not eaten in four weeks.I will be glad when tomorrow comes.Then my period started which was all I needed.Now Tony J. rings up from home to tell me he wants more instructions for Jonathan\'s solicitors I have had enough now.Lynn and Julie have just told me what Barnebey told me about Nichlolas I am sick of this place.I am off.Jonathan is playing about with the maintenance and I cant do anything about it.Why can\'t I be left alone.My tooth hurts like hell.I\'ve had a really up and down day to day.          I felt really good about myself this morning.          I liked what I was wearing, I felt that I dealt          with breakfast well, and then I came to the          house and it went downhill from there on.          I found the process group this morning very          unsettling,  and I felt extremely uncomfortable          after I confronted  Clarissa in the group.          It\'s a new experience for me when I\'m          worried about something, particularly when it          involves someone else and I have to confront          them and say what I feel.          I didn\'t apologize afterwards, though, which          was also new for me, but I can\'t say that I          felt good about it.          I did feel good, though when Peter confronted          me and I stood up for myself about that          breakfast.          I\'m so relieved that I don\'t  have to obsess          about how many calories etc. I\'m eating, and          that I know how much I can have and not feel          guilty.           Jo was also at the table, and said that if          she\'d thought I\'d eaten  or taken too much,          she\'d have said.          She also said that it was a good portion so          that just confirmed what I\'d felt.          The house feels very odd now, though.          That feeling of unity has somehow evaporated,          and I feel that everyone\'s watching everyone          else.          Clarissa\'s collage made me look once again at my          life, the pressure from the family, the          unhappiness that it\'s brought, and hopefully          what recovery could bring, if we stay in          recovery and want it badly enough.          My food feels very good at the moment, and          today, it feels like it\'s definitely in the          right place.          We had a really good laugh at dinner time          tonight, and that really cheered me up, as I\'d          been feeling a bit flat.          I spoke briefly with my mum today, and she           felt good about speaking to Linda and feeling          that she has to detach and let me get on with          it.          My mom  and dad are both going to go to Al-          Anon, and I think that\'ll really help them to          let go of their guilt that they\'ve been          carrying round with them.          Working on my Step 4 is really helping me too,          to highlight which areas I really struggle          with.          It\'s an ongoing process, obviously, but I feel          that I\'m at least identifying the areas which          still really bother me.',3,-5,0,1,5,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,2.11,0,0,0,0,4.22,2.11,0,0,3.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.12,0,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.8,0,0,3.17,0,0,0,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.44,12.68,2.11,2.11,0,0,0,0,2.11,1.06,0,0,0,0,4.22,0,0,8.46,Female52
'From yesterday - feeling of shame about my life          and my pain - perhaps that is why I could never          deal with anger, but keep it suppressed most of          the time.                    I feel good today and positive.          The group goal session was so-so: it was          obvious how quickly and without real effort we          all (or at least quite a few of my peer\'s and          my self) put down words; without being present          to the peer in question.          Some people actually copied the suggestions          from each other, and the reason for writing          this sown is, I felt hurt - I actually have not          isolated with any book (I am reading the OA          book right now)          For a week and have spoken to Gerry twice          during the same period.          Also I had 3 well done, but then got swept          under the: \"Drop the control\".          What is this telling me?!                    Clare\'s Step I Part II was a revelation to me          and I have identified with so much: - covering          up feelings of how self esteem, self-worth and          hate by baling others;          - when anorexia - fattening others up, when          overeating giving my self the largest and best          portion = manipulation.                    - Not asking anybody for help = control          - Panic attacks = crazy self pitying thoughts          - Being so scared of committing suicide is the          best way out of taking the lead into the          unknown.          - Starving is much more appealing than facing a bowl and vomiting.          - Starving so I could afford a binge on sweet          pastries and chocolate.          - Being so utterly terrified of feed, and being          so preoccupied with it there was no time left          for hardly anything especially business.                    - When the \"new distraction\" stopped working          reverting into overeating time and time again.                    - Never choosing alcohol or drugs as they left          me out of control.          Food satiated me and I could control it.                    - Self Pity = amnesia that\'s why I just could          not easily give specific examples for my Step          I.          Clare did not listen to any of us and walked          out to the kitchen during diner \"inquiries\"          about the vegetable burger.          I feel she is very manipulative, but I could be          wrong, as she could be also very frightened.Today has been a strain.                    Robert\'s lecture was interesting and it was good          to hear him talk about his non judgmental          views.          Before lunch I started to get a craving which          became nearly unbearable even after I had          eaten.          This afternoon I have felt restless even though          I have got work to do I just couldn\'t sit still          for long enough.          Supper was delicious for a change over the past          week or so it has been pretty poor  I just          depends if they feel like making an effort in          the kitchen!          I now have that bloody awful craving feeling          again.          What is the matter with me I didn\'t feel like          this for the first 7 weeks.          Do they ever go to good?A nothing sort of day for me.     I seem to go off somewhere in me head and can\'t get in touch with     myself.     I find it so frustrating.     In meditation I feel a sort of envy for the people who are able     to ask the group for help     I find it very hard to reach out to the group.     I often watch people and the way they relate as I feel I\'m missing     something.     I\'m too closed or too cold or something.     I feel cross with William every time I talk to him on the phone     and feel I must do something about The situation although I feel     I\'m too much of a coward. I rang Amber only to find out that Julia has had an abortion this week.She is now at home how much more can I take!Feelings towards it are anger that I am not their just in case she needs me.Sad that it has happened.I want to know who the father is how far pregnant she was why an abortion.How is she!I want to know.If she is well.',3,-5,0,2,5,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.44,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,2.98,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,5.95,4.46,0,0,0,2.98,2.98,0,13.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.46,2.98,49.13,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,55.09,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,22.33,5.96,0,0,0,0,5.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,Female52
'Today has been good.          I got a lot out of the video this morning even          though it was a bit long.          Ken\'s lecture was good as well.          I\'ve started to make a start on my Step 2-3          which feels good.          Had a chat with Amanda which was good and it          was a relief to know that I\'m going to start          dealing with the relationship with my parents          and family.          Lesley\'s step one was good and I identified          a lot with her.          Nick annoyed me with one of his comments but I          don\'t know why it had such a strong reaction.          I\'ve moved my stuff to the Woodpecker which          was OK.          Tonight I have felt very restless and full of          feelings but I haven\'t found anybody to talk to          they are all at the AA meeting.          This morning we shared our feelings with Robert, and  a          discussion started about the difference between dependence as          prescriptive drugs and self mutilation.          The drama was centered on Carol\'s relationship with her ex-          husband and I could identify with her feelings of self          confidence and self blame in a relationship giving someone a          free hand to walk all over you!          Also with the idea of letting go of that person and the          disappointment of how things didn\'t work out and constantly          believing that they would.          I hope you understand this.I feel really nervous, I know so many of my own blocks that I need to be challenging.I will try to listen objectively to the blocks AND resources.The Peer Evaluation felt more uncomfortable than I imagined, I found it so hard to hear peoples concern as I have convinced myself to the contrary.Paul\'s comment about my funeral  and Hugo\'s anger and frustration at my addictions really hurt me, but made me seriously look at the truth.Jo\'s remarks about my sadness, pain and love  that I need to show Matthew have really touched a sore point.I realize this is a crucial stage in the recovery program and am trying to be objective, but I am struggling with myself.Alex\'s collage helped me reach some realizations around what I have felt and what I believe I am wanting for the future - most significant being TERRIBLE SECRET - My abortion, JUDGMENT - my fear and constant judgment of myself by unspoken voices.Wanting balance and clarity for the future.Hugo disturbance and anger at my behavior around straightening mat, cutlery etc I have decided from today to try each mealtime to not wipe over or move mat.Will ask for help if this creates a problem in another way - which I am aware in the part (when I have tried to control my behavior) it has  - BUT I DO WANT TO TRY, albeit a small issue.Clarissa\'s Step 1 brought back my feelings of responsibility for any problems in my family - often expressed as my being a cause of argument or worry, but even when unsaid I took it upon myself that I was to blame.Immediately I had asked Amanda if I could take the asking for help exercise to next Friday, I regretted it thinking it is going to be hard, but I know it is really important I try - it will hopefully help me in the long run to be able to ask for help.Dr Robert\'s process group.          He asked us about the things that we least want to          talk about  - our fears.          Nearly everyone, including myself were most          concerned about the future - our success in          recovery, the hurdles ahead.          Our fears were almost completely allayed through\' the          outcome of IVANKA\'S  psychodrama.          That resulted in that the past with all its          pressures, mistakes etc, had gone.          That our recovery was the beginning of a new life          and we now had the chance to make a better life for          ourselves which we could feel satisfaction with.          A very positive ending to a morning with Robert.                    Was really happy to see children again, but regret I          was not very warm with my husband.          During the past few days I have expressed resentment          for my husband and those feelings were with me.           Felt really uncomfortable when he tried to put his          arm around me.          I was not affectionate, but my feelings wouldn\'t let          me respond in any other way.          If I don\'t make an effort to be friendly or          affectionate, this will lead to resentment for me on          my husbands behalf.          I wish I could give, but it\'s as if I\'m on strike.

'I feel like I\'m walking on air tonight.!          I cannot believe how good I feel after doing my          Step V today.          It really is amazing.          I thought I\'d be in bits at the end of it, but          I wasn\'t.           I felt shame, guilt, jealousy etc  but I          really feel like I\'ve learned so much.          Seeing my behavioral patterns repeat          themselves over and over and over again, I see          that I create what happens to me, or rather me          in my disease recreates it.          I could see so clearly how my disease has          affected me when I had to talk about my whole          life in one chunk.          I\'m so glad that I\'ve made it through Steps IV          an V, because I\'ve never made it to that          before.          I really feel like I\'ve achieved something and          it\'s such a nice feeling!          I\'m going to go over the rest of it tonight just          to check that I got everything out, but I feel          pretty certain  that I got everything out, but          we\'ll see.          I\'ve been told that I look radiant tonight, and          I actually feel that happiness within coming          out.          It\'s strange.          I went to the bottom of the garden with Rob &          Trudy tonight for some scream therapy, because          I had so much to shout and scream about, and so          much energy to release.          It\'s a very freeing feeling, and I can\'t say          how grateful I am that I\'ve stayed and got          through it.Felt depressed all day and tired, this kind of day I would have stayed in bed all day not wanting to face the world.Having cravings but shared about it in meditation.Want to isolate all day, felling restless, scared of my weight being on a plateau.!Couldn\'t concentrate at the movie, so went next door where only Roland was.Going to bed at 9 pm and praying for a more positive day.This is what I fear in recovery, to be clean but lonely.Spoke with Clarissa and then Charlie feeling envious of him that he is in a relationship and that I am coming second!Haven\'t really shared with anyone a part talking with Michel\'s parents.Obsessing about the meals.Felt scared in the Gremlins group as I don\'t feel I burned it, as it is sitting on my shoulder all day!Miss the outside world and sing Kate leaving.Why I am so dissatisfied with myself, why do I hate myself so much that I don\'t want to keep on living!I just feel back on square one.I hate my insurance isn\'t in order yet which make me feel that I am not entitled to be here.Wish we were always this number of patients.Feel like crying for Ioli.Keep comparing myself with other people and that my sadness is pathetic compared to Roland, Ioli, Linda.Am I every going to be happy?Looking forward to see Robert tomorrow.Went to the zoo so fed up can\'t eat anything would been better to stay at Promis.Every where I looked people were eating and having a good time.Julie and I went round together.I am so tired.If this is what life is going to be like forget it.Thank you for taking us out it was very kind but not a good idea for me with all that food.Then we get back to chocolate fudge pudding for dinner that has made my day.And my dear friend Marena had three!But we had to laugh.I shall miss her she is great fun now she is going.I feel much better this evening after sharing about today.I feel so fat tonight I am sure I am gaining weight.My clothes feel tight I must be.I want to get well as soon as I can.Step one part one I am glad it is over with look forward to part two.Marena life story not sure too short.Process group Claire not doing too well at all.Bob and Mel came this afternoon I am happy here now went to post office.Saw a mouse in the drawing room other peers saw it as well.Half hour fun time meditation Nicole very upset about Giles.Play reading tomorrow for open day.I hope I sleep tonight.Please God.Lyn rang home very unhappy had a long chat about her ex boy friend and what she should do.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.64,0,0,0,13.19,0,0,0,2.64,0,0,0,0,2.64,0,0,0,0,0,2.64,0,2.64,2.64,5.27,0,0,5.28,0,0,0,1.32,0,0,2.64,0,43.52,0,2.64,0,0,0,0,5.27,0,65.93,0,0,5.28,0,0,0,1.32,0,5.27,0,2.64,0,0,0,19.77,22.41,0,0,0,0,10.54,0,2.64,0,0,0,0,0,3.96,0,0,15.81,Female52
'I have had a good day, I didn\'t enjoyed the zoo last time I went,          but this time it was really a day that I wont forget, the weather          was great and the company I was with make me feel comfortable and          relaxed I have had a very good day.          The only difference was that there was no kids with us that was          a bit strange, But I had time for myself which was something new.          Then the rest of the day was relaxed but I do feel tired from the          walkingI felt I had a much better day today.          I was very in Rania\'s life story which was quite moving, and I          find it generally difficult to know what to say to her          afterwards in terms of comfort.          I felt much more positive and I found it nice to go for a          walk.          I am finding my cross-addiction sheet impossible and can\'t get          to grips with it at all.          Apart from that I feel better.          Slept badly and felt restless in the morning, enjoyed listening to ken, thought process group was very short and wished there was more of it.I am still very obsessive around mealtimes and could very well eat more!Identified with the collage, but after my life story felt very empty and raw, and had sugar cravings.Helped to share in meditation and nice to have a laugh with Peter & Margarita.Was asked to go for a walk with Martin and share about why I am here.Hate that my obsession with weight is still such a issue.Miss daycare for the confrontations, but also feel I wouldn\'t be able to stay away from the food.Received a very caring letter from Catherine.No news from my family.Fun day at last.I was very nervous this morning.I was biting my teeth so much they hurt.Dentist Monday thank goodness.I hated looking at all the lovely food.Everyone was so good.Nicholas rang I have to ask if he can come next Saturday afternoon because he had to go to Heathrow Sunday.I am so tired tonight I wonder what we will do tomorrow.Good night everybody.',4,-4,0,2,5,0,0,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.71,0,0,0,0,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.84,0,0,32.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.2,0,0,10.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.68,21.68,0,5.42,0,0,8.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.13,Female52
'Thank God for today!Slept Ok, after having a really bad day yesterday.The morning started by being unmanageable forgetting meditation and therapeutic duty with Spyros.Felt really safe with Robert and got a lot of identification with Fiona\'s psychodrama and how submissive I am in relationships.Finding it really difficult to be around Fenella as she is very strange around the food but can\'t share with her yet.Felt really happy to see Justine and she gave me a present, spend the afternoon with her and was relief to come back as I was felling the old thoughts of how fat I am.Good to be in meditation  and share a positive day and relief that I didn\'t want to go back using after seeing Rob and how stone he looked.Happy for Roland that he has the opportunity to talk about recovery.Hope to postpone the shopping trip until next week.Spoke to Spyros about the food and hop my insurance is getting sorted out as I feel I am abusing PromisI have been very tired today and quiet, I went to bed this          afternoon that\'s the first time I\'ve done that since I\'ve been          here I felt quite moody when I got up.          I went to the fun fair tonight; I thought it was good it made a          really nice change to be out with friends and have a good couple          of hours out like that, I still feel (PM) tired I am going to bed          early tonight.          I hope that I feel better in the morning.Enjoyed seeing my visitors today.     I saw my father very briefly but was touched that he made the     effort to come all that way for such a short time.     It was nice to see William and Nick again.     I don\'t feel part of the group or liked whatever I don\'t know how     much it\'s my problem - I do feel it\'s quite cliquey here and      I often find myself boiling with resentment and feeling inadequate     - Then again this is my problem I just don\'t know what to do     about it and and certainly don\'t think I can change it - so?      Feel miserable at the thought of facing real life - my life never     really picked up again after the last breakdown and I feel like     I lost the whole of last year so there\'s very little to go back to.     This makes me fee, sad, despairing etc.My day started well I have been looking forward to seeing Ryan          with his new bike, I am so pleased that he is happy with it I did          enjoy the group today but when I was going to speak I couldn\'t,          I thought I was going to pass out my heart started thudding really          hard and then the room went black I thought it was a panic          attack but it wasn\'t my breathing changed and I went hot and cold          and I started shaking I felt awful, after I went to the nurses          station she said my pulse was all right, I had stopped shaking          outside but inside my body was trembling for quite a while.          I went and spoke to Adrian for a while and I felt much better          after.          The visit this afternoon went very well I have had a good day.

'Feeling very relaxed and good tonight after a very positive day.Starting by hearing those hopeful letters of joy of recovery.Felt more relaxed around my body image and weight for once.Enjoyed relaxation and the walk with Roland and Ioli, ending up the last one with Spyros.Finding it hard to put feelings to this sheet, as I am very tired and want to take a hot bath.Feel bad that I have taken up smoking again.Felt compassion for Jade and very privileged to have dinner with her in the dinning room.In general a long hopeful day.A bit disappointed that I can\'t stay with my sister next week!But, maybe there is a reason to it.Shared with Kate and missing Nelly, can\'t believe how far away it seems since she left.Feel left out when I have shared with a person and then later on they share with someone else.Pretty ok morning, though I was a bit anxious about          meeting husband.          It didn\'t turn out so good.          He was still obsessed with my leaving date.          When?  I told him I didn\'t know myself, but as he          was so insistent I left it up to him to find out?  I          was very cold, he didn\'t even get a hello.          He got confrontation because of the issue he put          forward on his card to me.          Maybe I have been over-reacting.          I was assertive over a couple of issues that I          didn\'t feel like having now.          But it\'s obvious I had no alternative.          I felt guilty also, because he looked like I had          done him injury.                    I couldn\'t tell him that I love him - and can\'t          promise that I will.          I see the children are happy with both of us.          I was also upset that he has decided that Emma          should go back to Malta with him tomorrow morning as          I didn\'t have a definite date of completion from          recovery.          I left a message with when this issue was          brought up and let him know that the decision should          be made on \"What\'s better for Emma?\"  I was upset          that I only learned of the decision by piecing          bits of conversation together.          So, not a good day.          I told him I\'ve got to focus on my treatment and to          not give me any more outside concerns.In Wendy\'s Peer Evaluation it made me think how easily I get involved in concerns outside PROMIS, I feel I need to be in touch with home life but know I need to get a better balance.Laia\'s Step 1 left me feeling very thoughtful around several issues.  The main think I felt was that although I feel I had admitted   and that I believed my life was totally chaotic, I don\'t really think I had admitted to myself what damage I had down to my body.Looking back honestly, the more worn out my body became the harder I seemed to push myself so as not to think about it.I new see the importance of accepting and facing the fears and my need to talk and share.Paul\'s COLLAGE took me back to how I always tried to be what I thought my Dad wanted me to be  - but how I will never get his approval, also that I have been so caught up in trying to make friends and be accepted as a person in my own right.I feel desperately strung out by the exercise suggested by Ken - it feels so uncomfortable for me to have people doing things to help me.I find it difficult to ask for help, but am really trying to ask when appropriate.I know it is well meant but it is reminding me of the restrictions imposed on me last year in Hospital (although logically I know it is not done for the same reasons) - it feels punishing.I am really trying to think positively but feel very unsettled at the moment and struggling with the whole program, food, groups and particularly myself as to why I am feeling so strung out.I know I need to share and the suggestion is so that I have to face the feelings  - but I have been sharing each evening and whenever I can not isolating and going to bed early.Obviously I do need help.I was awake this morning at 1/4 past 6 which is really early for          me and I felt good.          I feel relaxed that I have sent the letter to Darren and I had          the phone call from him and he is moving Sunday because of his          lifts to and from work.          He has been very understanding about the situation and I am so          pleased about that.          I spoke to my mum tonight I had wrote her a letter saying I am          sorry for the way I have been over the last couple or more years          we had a good chat on the phone and she is coming up to see me          tomorrow with my sister and her kids.          I hope Ryan comes back from his friends on time to come up as          well, I have had a good but quiet day today.

'Today has been good.                    In Margarita\'s peer evaluation I realized that things          won\'t have changed at home and that it is going          to be the way I act that will make things          change.          I just hope that I will be strong enough.          I don\'t know how to start dealing with the          relationship with my parents.          I know I\'ve got to talk about it but I just          seem to go round in circles.                    Had a good shopping trip and it was nice to see          a bit of civilization.                    I know it\'s projecting but I wish I new what I          was going to do when I leave here or what I          really want to do.I found Justine\'s Peer Evaluation thought-provoking as it made me realize the areas which I am aware I need to be aware of.I am conscious I am a \"people-pleaser\" and am trying to think more before I act - it is so much part of me that I find it very difficult, but will keep trying.Also I find it really painful to listen to other people\'s pain, particularly when I can strongly identify - I get this overwhelming feeling of wanting to take away their pain, make it all OK for them - I need  to detach more and focus on my own pain, but still find it impossible sometimes to look and accept my painful emotions.Lesley\'s Step 1 took me way back to when I was just on a downward spiral of self-destruction - I don\'t think I really acknowledged until today just how I had given in to my addiction and felt taken over by it all, on a total denial of myself.I am still finding it really difficult to feel what I am saying - I am hoping recapping on my life story will help me reach these feelings.After speaking with Linda, Amanda with Keith I felt very uneasy.I had felt I was trying but felt I was perhaps being unreasonable as Keith had commented * was a pattern of dislikes seen before.I do feel that it was heard and acknowledged that I was struggling and appreciated the chance to talk - I still feel worried by it an some days are particularly hard.Harriet\'s role play/session was hard to watch how she reacted and it seemed harsh, but the more I thought about it the reasons and caring behind it really made sense.My sharing, although difficult, I felt helped me by actually saying it - because I still couldn\'t quite believe it - I also feel it helped others to see that asking and believing people do care to help.It has certainly proved it to me.was rather disappointed with Robert\'s lecture not as good as before.I did not get a lot out of today but he is very good.Rowena and Amber are not coming tomorrow after all.Nicholas came today and took me out I find it very hard not to eat when I go out but he is so good with me.Gave me lots of flowers as he does every week.Told me jonathon has bought himself a boat now.What next I should think the children will use it.I want to be out of here by the 15 October to go to a Faith Convention.Mel\'s step one I do think his drug using should be addressed as well going by what he has shared with me.Collage went quite well only I think one is expected to just break down but if I do that who is going to put me back together again and how long will it take.And I don\'t want any more antidepressants or drugs.How on earth could I say who I was protected from.I hardly understand it myself so why should any one else believe it.Also I can\'t afford to break home office confidentiality Mark R. would never forgive me.I have already said more than I should I hope I haven\'t done that.I am so sad about Julia I have written to her but I don\'t think she will read the letter.I would like to talk to her but there is no point.There is a peer who has made my promise not to tell that they are planning to leave on Sunday.I have just been given my cross addiction assessment sheet back and I wish I had never filled in the form.I see no hope at all.I will have to spend every day at meetings.I think I will just do one day at a time meditation and the big book.I wont have time for anything else.I have still got a tooth ache I wish I could get my teeth done now.Robert is here tomorrow he is like a father to us.It seems we are his children in a nice way.He understands us which I can only say it is so good not to be on any drugs even if I do not sleep.May be at last I am not insane or mad perhaps I am just a addict no sugar or white flour.I hope everyone wont laugh if I show them my sheet.I have my step two and three next Friday.',3,-5,1,1,1,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.35,0,2.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.28,0,10.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.67,0,0,5.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.35,13.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.12,0,0,0,0,2.23,0,0,0,Female52
'Pipa\'s leaving presentation made me feel how much care and support  are with the Group.  Also shocked me to realize that I had been anorexic for so long compared to her addictions, realization and commitment to trying to get well and recovery.  I really admired her for her courage and honesty and hoped I could be so honest with myself. Step 1 was very moving.I could identify the confusion and feeling of being enable to escape  a terrible situation, relationship and financial chaosHis deep hurt at rejecting his children also disturbed me.I for the first time started to worry about all the financial things I would need to sort when back home  - but firmly told myself things will be different - need to think long and hard before suggesting/trying to face them.Emma-Jane\'s Peer Evaluation left me fearing the time when I will have mine - but also made me aware of exactly what I should be looking at within myself.Feel very edgy today, finding peoples\' generally well meant comments very concerning - my head knows what I should be doing but I still feel so scared by it all.After speaking with Linda, asked for time at Process Group.Felt relieved I had said my feelings and asked as best I could for some help- although I felt really guilty and inadequate to have to say.  The group were really supportive - Harriet mentioned she ate her meals at the Nurses Station initially and suggested if I was struggling to ask - I decided to try with the groups support but will ask if I feel I\'m finding it too tough.Lesley\'s Life Story left me feeling very moved and I could see her controlled pain - which reminded me of my icy coldness when I can\'t look at my past.This morning, I feel very vulnerable and sensitive.Lesley\'s Step 1 was very moving - I could not relate to the being side and bringing back food up to 30 times a day, but it reminded me of how I felt after just a cup of tea prior to coming to PROMIS - feeling guilty about having anything to eat or drink or any kind of rest with a day.Also brought out memories of how isolated and lonely I felt, but unable to tell anyone, being ashamed of myself.The guilt and shame she felt, as though her parents were disappointed in her, reminded me of how I still do feel about the termination I had and how I let them down.I can tell Lesley how nice a person she is - how she serves to be free of her addictions and what she has to look forward to with her abilities - I feel I have made such a mess of my life compared to her academic qualifications.Many other feelings surfaced which I will try to stick with and will write in my Feelings Journal.I was disappointed that when I asked TATU I was not allowed to take part at all this week with GYM, but after my assessment with Jack he suggested I do 5 only on each station, which I feel able to cope with and with feel more part of the group and know it is doing me good.He also felt it was important for me to do 5 minutes stretching/on the bike gently each day for the OSTEOPOROSIS - which I hope will be agreed as I have been waking up in pain in my hips/joints.The Process Group was good and aired several peers anxieties - I found it disturbing how Alice felt about her returning to PROMIS and really wanted to tell her how she is so well thought of and wanted to share with her but I am afraid she will snap at me as she is so sensitive at the momentMy confrontations are becoming more considerate          of others and less frightening for myself.          I so desperately pray to be given the precious          gift of being the \"true\" Ivanka, and to project          love, kindness and gentleness instead of fear          and aggressiveness.                    In this mornings group, I was shocked to find          out to what extent it felt to  I was          abandoned (for quite a long time in my          marriage.           It just came out of me and I instantly knew and          recognized this painful truth.          Perhaps, it will help me to put my marriage          finally in past to rest and eventually to start          building a more \"real\" relationship with the          father of my only child.                    Playing outside with my peers was such a          fun - it became obvious to me to what extent I          use clothes as a \"something to hold me          together\" - I just could not be scruffy  - the          memories of those times lessen I did not care          about my appearance are still fresh in my mind.          Because they where not very happy times.           And to what extent I resented having to wear          \"motherly\" clothes after Leonarda was born and          hardly any jewelry at all.                    I am so very glad these memories are back - at          least they make it possible for me to see many          different aspects of anorexia and overeating.                    It was good to see the \"mirroring\" put to          practice - that is, we only see in other\'s what          we have in ourselves!!!                    I am so very grateful to be here!Today started off badly - I felt depressed and weepy - I felt     that there was nothing I could do to change my life that I would     always be depressed and never be able to manage life etc etc.     I saw Dr. Rohan and felt again that I\'ve been bombarded by all     these opinions about what\'s wrong with me and what is the solution?     Is the 12 step a solution for me? and am I really an addict?     I\'d been resenting the fact that a certain rable stick together     every meal time and am pleased I got it off my chest in meditation     this evening.     I\'ve noticed that I do feel better when I express myself - it\'s     just getting to it that\'s the problem',4,-5,0,1,5,1.96,3.92,0,1.96,1.96,0,0,1.96,3.92,0,3.92,0,5.88,0,0,0.98,0,0,0,0.98,0,0.98,0,0,0,0,0.98,1.96,0,0,10.78,0,0,0,5.88,0,0,0,0.98,0,0,0.98,0,36.26,0,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,52.92,0,0,13.72,0,0,0,0,0,1.96,0,1.96,0,0,0,4.9,16.66,3.92,0.98,0,0,1.96,0.98,1.96,1.96,0,0,0,0,1.96,0,0,3.92,Female52
'I felt absolutely terrified when Ken said about the group helping me and although at the end of the group I thought it is well meant and I would try and see how it went.But when I went outside to make my drink LAIA started to insist she do it, I felt it wasn\'t right for her to be running around after me as she had only just said herself she was overly caring and trying to control others.I then felt really under pressure, nervous and insecure about just one day, never mind a week.Wendy came to see if I was OK and I just crumbled, she gave me a hug and asked had I ever had a real hug from someone who cared and it reminded me of how desperately I needed and never had hugs from my mom.It also made me aware of how impossible it is for me to accept help.I feel a closeness to Wendy and have found sharing very hopeful, at first I found her manner and concern  had to accept, but now feel grateful.When I saw Dave, I was still feeling very vulnerable and tearful.I was not able to tell him immediately what had gone on in group as it didn\'t feel safe, but decided after a couple of hours I needed to tell him.I found it really difficult, but he did listen and was understanding.I felt very responsible for him feeling low as he said he was finding it difficult being on his own.I was in an OK mood this morning I thought Beverly\'s step one was          very sad as she had everything going for her, I did identify a few          things with her, I also shared with her about my problem with          Darren it was hard to talk about as I still keep crying I wish          I could stop the tears.          I went to the country club had a good swim.          Had a good chat with Ryan, also talked with Kiara when I came          back from the meeting she wanted to listen to my story about          Buster, cause I shared with her the other day, I haven\'t had a          nice day today I have felt horrible most of the evening.I got a lot out of today but am worried that I\'ll forget all this     new information that keeps coming at me from all directions.     I really enjoyed the AA meeting this evening.     I was quite upset by mini-group today - I wasn\'t surprised by     what I heard but didn\'t like to hear it all the same.     I get irritated all the time by petty things  and don\'t know     what it\'s about or what to do about it.     Today I resolved that I wouldn\'t withdraw and isolate and would try     and open up to the group more rather than turning it inwards.I have had quite a good day until Amanda told me I could go to          the post office on my own.          I did think she said I had to go on my own I was so shocked, fear          just set in from nowhere I didn\'t know what to do what to think,          I panicked and I don\'t know why, I have been thinking why, I don\'t          know.          Anyway the rest of the day went well, I\'ve been quite relaxed.          Had a good talk with Amanda about several things, I also want to          move from the village as soon as possible their is nothing their          for me and Ryan anymore I need to make a new start and get away          from all the shitty people their.          Even though I really like my house I wish that I could just move          it somewhere else.

'E-Jane\'s presentation left me feeling uneasy - I felt that she was still struggling within herself, she had acknowledged it but I felt frightened to see it.Some of E-Jane\'s behavior over the past couple of weeks has disturbed me and it has made me look at myself more closely - I am unsettled within myself.Sheila\'s Group, I feel sad when I think of all that Sheila\'s been though as a direct result of her addictions and that even now when she has worked so hard for her recovery she is still facing the consequences of the past.Looking back at my life, I can see how much damage has been done and how my addictions have affected others lives - it frightens me and I feel resentful.Talking with Marilyn was helpful, her being able to cope with a  crisis in her life so soon after leaving PROMIS has given me hope.Being able to share with her some of my anxieties around family life/the future is so important.Les\' COLLAGE - I could identify with the fact his parents had wanted a baby of the opposite sex.I was told many times my Dad had wanted a boy - I had sort hair and my middle name DANE was, so I was told a motorbike (MASCULINE) name.I can also remember wanting to `have a good time\' when I left Terry and going out with lots of different people, not sexual relationships but just seemed to be wanted and in demand.When I look back now, I never did, only sad and lonely.I shared with Justine some thoughts around the future/career.My relationship with Dave - it helped me see a few things I needed to hear - I felt hopeful and excited by the possibilities but also frightened - of life and decision making.Can\'t believe I have been here a month!yes I do feel better being abstinent, but I hate my body still and feel fat!Enjoyed process group as I can identify with the disease and how powerful it is.Also, realizing that I still crave for drugs, as I can imagine how fast I would lose the weight.Very powerful peer evaluation for Debs.Enjoyed the walk with Maddie, Carol, Kattie, Jacqui.Got a lot of identification around michel Step 1, and was happy to be in the second part of his Step 1.Shared in NA, but wouldn\'t be able to stay clean with one meeting a week and mostly people from Promis.Going to bed felling grateful to be clean + sober and not thinking about breakfast.Feeling very tired and drained after doing my step 1 wondering what I can say in my second part as I don\'t want to look at the past as it brings pain and waist of time.My using has left me with nothing no career or good relationships.Very good peer evaluation for Kostas and thought Spyros did a very good job at translating.Process group was helpful, but still feel I can\'t take time before my payment has been settle.Could share in OA around my poor relationship and  how the weight was so important to be loved.Feeling tired and sad, hearing the news about Nelly and identifying with her pain as I can identify with her relapse after leaving treatment.Haven\'t heard about my family and don\'t care wish they wasn\'t in my life at present.Looking forward to see Ioli and start sharing more about my pain and powerless over my addiction.I thought that AK\'s P and U went well.          We have been trying hard to aggravate her but she\'s          still as polite as ever.          The reason for this is to try to sway her          concentration away from.          Never knew she may perfect herself into being          horrid.          My first step I thought went well.          I was nervous to start, but somehow I lost the          feeling.          I felt good about that because as I lost my self-          consciousness, I was asked to concentrate better and          appreciated all the feed back - and all the help of          the group.                    To lop-off the day we had our trip to Canterbury          which was fairly big spending spree.          We ran everywhere.

'Feeling anxious about new person coming to share our room as Wendy and I have had so many changes over the last 10 days it feels unsettled.Change is a real problem area for me.The argument and swearing in Meditation left me feeling nervous - I was pleased that at the Process Group it was all brought into the open and hope that the atmosphere in the home will improve.The situation surrounding Laia and her losing weight really concerned me - I wrote in my Feelings Journal that I was unhappy at Laia\'s statement that I always asked her to join me for a stroll, whereas the truth was she had asked me to always ask her - I felt in some way that I was being held responsible, but now realize it was my own willingness and need for friendship that I had got in that position.I felt very sad and powerless as I couldn\'t help her or ease the reality  of the situation.Barry\'s need for friendship also realized memories of how I have in the past and up until fairly recently bent over backwards to form friendships and the hurt I was often left with.Lesley\'s Step 1 helped me get in touch with my being unable to fully think positively about myself in the future.The split group was really useful just to talk over problems and fears, I wanted to share my confused state of mind but was unable to.Did say in Meditation how I had been very disturbed by the anger and atmosphere and aftermath of Margarita and how I felt very thoughtful.Feel anxious about Lesley\'s Peer Evaluation as I still feel confused as to her true feelings around Powerlessness/Unmanageability will discuss and share with peers to hopefully feel clearer.I was happy this morning but I was getting nervous about my peer          evaluation, I thought it would be not sharing, I am trying hard I did          open meditation tonight, I don\'t think I can handle asking for          time tomorrow if its a big group, when I talked in group today          I thought I was going to pass out I felt very giddy my legs felt          like they were on fire, I had never felt that before, all evening          I have been looking through magazines for pictures for my collage          all I have found so far is words.          I have had a good phone call with Ryan he was very talkative he          is pleased about getting his bike mended so he wasn\'t moaning at          me, I feel quite contented after talking to Ryan I am going to          have a bath now and go to bed.          Good night.Mel step one relapse was very sad she is completely out of control with her drink and drug problem at least she stayed.Suzann\'s life story I hope I never end up like that she is so lonely no friend no meetings or meditation no God no anything only her cats.Beverly life story no change Chiara life story.I asked Titus if he had a leaving date for me and he said you can go any time I think I will do that I have been here nearly 6 weeks and I am vegetating so I think I will go.I will have to take the consequences of the court case and my disease.My peers are sick of hearing about my ex-husband and children I am sick of talking about him so I have let go and now it is my turn to live.Thank you for all your help.And now I can get my teeth sorted out and they will not hurt any more.Also I will be able to go to my church on Sunday.Praise The Lord.I have just finished my collage and I feel sick and ready to face my ex-husband.Why the hell did I let him nearly kill me.The group this morning around Emma-Jane, diet weight etc helped me identify how powerful and destructive the desire to control can be.I find it very difficult to hear talk around this area as it is something I know I need to have trust in and yet have to battle with myself not to worry about.Robert\'s comments on being as happy as you want to be was really useful - I will certainly try to look on the positive side when I start to feel down.The Psychodrama really raised a lot of identification for me - the fear of comments, the inability to take any compliment constructively -turning every sentence round to batter myself.Worrying even now how I will cope without retreating/returning to old ways of coping.It was really good to see my friends from Church, I felt embarrassed by their care and kindness and their concern for my recovery.The well wishes from my Church left me feeling very unworthy of their concern - I feel I should be there now doing my bit for society - it makes me feel angry with myself, but grateful for their friendship.Matthew rang me and I found it very difficult to say I would speak to him soon knowing it would be some time before I will see him again - I think I need to seriously consider trying to arrange something - I fear being totally apart will be more damaging.I have not appreciated until now how much I do love and miss him, I must try to hold the feeling.Jane rang me - I urgently need to speak to Amanda.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,0,2.14,0,0,2.14,0,6.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,0,0,0,0,2.14,0,4.29,0,0,0,7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.3,0,6.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.72,0,0,16.08,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,0,2.14,0,1.07,0,10.72,21.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.29,0,0,4.29,Female52

I am having dreams about me mother not caring for me and have          had for a while which is weird because I know she does.          As for feelings right now  I am feeling quite angry and very          sick and dizzy which is more or less the flu.          I don\'t think Jan is a very considerate nurse. I am still finding it very difficult to write these sheets, I          don\'t feel anything significant I feel quite depressed and a          bit better so mixed feelings really, group this morning seemed          to be very strained and nobody was very valuable.          But the group for Romain\'s relapse was much better and I felt          sympathetic towards him, apart from that my day has been quite          long and I\'m finding it difficult to be around people all the          time with very little time to myself.          I feel discouraged and sad, yet at the same time hopeful.Am really trying to keep it in the day and not project and fear how long I will be kept in Detox.I am angry with myself and yet slowly coming to accept and believe this is what I need now in my recovery program - I have found the last couple of weeks so hard and I do feel weary emotionally and physically.For the last 7 weeks I have successfully convinced myself I am OK as I am on treatment and looking back I have continued to be hard on myself, ignoring what was underneath.I am finding it hard to face the facts of how difficult the step work etc I have completed has been and that I felt I had tried my best, or thought I had - and my reward to myself has been what feels like the start of a prison sentence.I know it is not meant to be, but it just feels like a punishment.My initial fear was of isolation, but have started thinking I will perhaps have to start questioning the fear of being alone for even a small period?I feel very uncomfortable and guilty about the amount of kindness people have shown and afraid of upsetting anyone by refusing.But also recognize I need to learn to be able to say no if I feel I need to.I will try to find a balance as best I can.',3,-4,0,1,5,4.26,2.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.84,0,2.84,0,5.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,2.84,0,0,0,0,8.51,0,0,0,4.26,0,0,2.84,8.52,0,0,0,2.84,2.84,0,1.42,0,48.25,0,8.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,69.54,0,0,4.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.26,2.84,0,0,0,25.53,21.29,0,0,0,0,5.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.84,0,0,2.84,Female52
'Felt very frightened at the complexity and depth of Amanda\'s lecture.I have felt very affected by the thoughts I\'ve been having over the last few days as a result of looking at my compulsive Helping collage.When I was weighed I felt nervous after the feedback Group statement.After my group I feel relieved yet very unsettled.Amanda\'s lecture and comments from other peers about having a relationship in recovery has forced me to accept I am going to have a battle now with myself,, let alone in recovery.I am so disappointed with myself, I\'ve been here 7 weeks and have cheated myself.I thought I was trying, but part of me has still been fighting.Yesterday and today have been the hardest for me during my time at PROMIS  and instead of feeling relieved and encouraged, I feel sad and anxious for the future.I know that this is for my own good, but it feels so hard and I can\'t cope today with the feeling of not knowing how long I will be here away from the group.I think Robert was trying to put me on a spot this morning about Nicholas.I don\'t know why because if it weren\'t for him I wouldn\'t be alive.I am only doing this for me and no one else.Nicholas does not use me and I don\'t him.We are very special friends we would help each other but not to the extent were it was considered compulsive helper but as God said in the bride.I don\'t see why I am justifying myself or my actions to anyone when there is nothing to hide.My car alarm would not stop today it needs a service which I will get done.Nicholas came to see me and gave me three lots of flowers this week.And a very interesting book lots of photographs.He had a message from Charlotte for me and a letter.Moved room this evening a nice little red room don\'t know who I am sharing with yet.I have to go to the dentist tomorrow afternoon.Wrote a letter to Carlos and Helena.I think Robert was telling me not to go to Portugal I don\'t know why.I have very little to keep me in England.I have more friends over there in the church that friends over here.Wake-up tired, and get tired most of the day, and was grateful to be able to lie down, it is so strange to have my periods back.Feel very unreal, and trying so hard to be accepted by the group.Feel different to be the only one with a weight problem, just feel so  gross and lonely must of the day.Don\'t really share with anyone.Just cruising around and disappointed that my parents haven\'t left any messages.Just a bit negative and depressed.Meditation in Big Book readings left me feeling anxious for the day ahead - the atmosphere in the Group at the moment is tense and I feel edgy.I only saw part of the video, but what I saw was interesting.I was really worried about the goals group as I had not been to one before - I didn\'t know quite what to expect. I especially became concerned when I tried to write my own goal and I recognized my own problem areas - I knew I had a need to ease up and be more patient with myself.Although scared of what would be said, it was reassuring in a strange way that others identified with most of what I felt.I also panicked when giving my input relating to my fellow peers as I was anxious not to upset or hurt anyone\'s feelings.On the whole it was not anywhere near as bad as I had expected it to be.Justine\'s Step 1 raised a lot of feelings that I could identify with, when I tried to find the words it came out wrong, but it brought out a lot for me.I can always remember panicking for days if not weeks before.What could I wear was the first worry, then what could I talk about always trying to make good conversation, interesting, interested and invariably trying to avoid questions about me and what I was doing.I always felt very on guard on the day - if I actually got there at all - just waiting for the first comment.I would desperately avoid any risky situation ie being alone, only coping with minimal contact.The limited contact (today first time I\'ve really faced it) is still with me - worry if I talk to anyone for too long or spend time with them they will see what I am really like? and wont like me.Even friends I\'ve known for year.The never being good enough, the feeling of failure, what they did for me not being what I wanted, but feeling ungrateful, undeserving if I said anything.My time with Linda was difficult for me to hear, but I know I have to face my difficulty with confrontation & anger - I will try and share my fear and find the right words to enable me to say something at the next Process Group - it has made me realize I must stand up for myself and not let anyone get in the way with or block my road to recovery.',3,-5,0,1,5,2.18,0,0,4.36,0,0,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,4.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,18.54,0,0,0,10.9,0,0,0,1.09,0,0,3.27,2.18,53.42,0,3.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,67.59,0,2.18,29.44,0,3.27,0,0,0,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,4.36,14.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female52
'Following my meeting Graham (5/12) felt worried by the prospect of being put on BUILD-UP Plan, even though he said it would be introduced by phasing in.  Still struggling at mealtimes, particularly some lunch times.Finding very difficult.At breakfast I was told to have BUILD-UP breakfast from today - feel very anxious about this - I know logically I need to, but feel very frightened I can cope.Harriet\'s Step 1 (Recovery) reminded me of so many things I had got caught up in before Promis.The confusion, justifying cutting down/out food after feeling guilty about yes   The constant keeping busy - afraid to charge but feeling so desperately trapped.It has frightened me that she relapsed after treatment and my identification with her has made me very scared.The letter to God was really difficult to believe what I felt  I wanted write - it really made me think of where I am now.The art group raised feelings of deep sadness at where and what I am now.  It reiterated my feeling of inadequacy and what a mess I had made of my life.Rebecca\'s leaving presentation left me low, I shall really miss her warmth and kind personality, but it did leave me with a glimmer of hope how positively I can see the change in her.I have found today very difficult, following the OA meeting last night and a comment from Harriet which I couldn\'t handle plus the emotions as a result of the groups today.The letter to God made me search, the artwork made me remember, although I wouldn\'t really look for to long - I wanted to run, I wondered what I was doing here, maybe I wasn\'t ready to face myself after all.I am feeling is there any point, there are so many feelings of pain inside, but where do I start .I know I have to be patient but I just don\'t what or where to start. Hearing about relapse has scared me so much, I know I have to be really honest to myself to make the most of the help available to me, but I feel so scared of change and facing myself.Humor - asse',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,8.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.4,0,0,2.16,10.8,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,7.56,0,28.08,0,5.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.12,0,0,7.56,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,1.08,14.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,0,Female52
'Woke up feeling tense and anxiousPaul\'s Peer\'s Evaluation left me feeling very aware of what I have to ask of myself - I know that I must be more considerate of my own needs making them known to others and recognizing myself what I need.I must be so careful of being too caring and trying to make others right.I found lunch and my meeting with Linda, Amanda and Dr Railing very fraught - as I do feel from my heart that I am really trying.I could understand what Dr Railing was saying and I hope after speaking with Keith I will feel a bit more at ease about it.I had a chat with Marilyn which I found really helpful - she can identify with me on many issues and I also identify with her.She shares with me on family recovery matters which have been troubling me when I think about the future - I am really trying to keep it in the day, but some feelings that surface during the days groups starts my mind working.Emma-Jane\'s Step 1 on Anorexia, although I couldn\'t identify with the pattern - I could with the starving throughout  the day just to allow myself going out for a meal or even just having a glass or two or wine with Dinner.  I would go without during the day and then limit what I had to eat/drink for Dinner too.Also reminded me of  being unable to make my needs known in circumstances surrounding mealtimes, for fear of comments being made.I felt confused as to how she swapped from her addiction of Bulimia to reasonably \"NORMAL\" eating with Peter and was unsure of how/if she accepted her need to change - especially as the relationship won\'t be there and she is talking now of losing the weight when she gets out - which I personally have found hard to hear.Since Amanda kindly spoke to Malcolm about the ECR Application, telling me to leave it with them - I really worked at trying not to worry or fuss over it - telling myself I had more than enough to cope with just settling in an that it was being dealt with by the best people who knew what they were doing.I was so surprised, I still cant believe it - I seem to expect the worst, I am very grateful and appreciate the offer to leave it to Malcolm as settling in has been more difficult (in many ways) than I had expected.Feel much more positive today.     Actually had some fun for the first time in ages.     No real process group sadly - I often feel that there isn\'t     enough time to share or that my concerns aren\'t as important as     other peoples.     The atmosphere is so much better in the house and I feel really     comfortable for the first time since being here.     I feel more positive about treatment though still having problems     with addictive disease concept - I\'m real not trying to be     stubborn about this but do feel a bit of a fraud over my     \'alcoholic\' and \'overeater\' status.     I don\'t know what I can do about this other than keep an open     mind.     I have the rest of my step 1 tomorrow and feel a bit apprehensive     as Annie asked me to concentrate more on eating examples - I don\'t     seem to have that many.I woke up this morning feeling anxious, and very mixed after a restless few hours broken sleep.I still feel I can\'t reach some feelings which I know are there and yet to painful to touch - although  I find it difficult I will ask for time at the Process Group.Felt very nervous at Group, especially as Margarita was so upset - what I had to say felt very insignificant, but I said my bit anyway.  It really helped when 3 people identified, especially Emma-Jane\'s, where she had obviously been feeling very similar emotions, mixed with joy and pain.I hope to share some more with her.The Community Group was a bit fraught because of the announcement smoking but I am pleased I can look after the cats as it makes me feel part of the group.I feel unhappy about the situation with Lesley as I have tried on several occasions to help by offering to go for a walk/play scrabble or just do something so she is not alone - she has occasionally accepted but more often backed off or become defensive if I have mentioned about her using the toilet at home.I know she is really struggling with accepting she needs to look seriously at the Bulimia, but find it hard not to take it personally when she asks for help but will not take any.My time with Amanda and Linda was really helpful - I didn\'t realize the true significance of my Artwork until I talked through it. I certainly have a lot to look at with this representation and where my life was at just before PROMIS.I felt I had come to compromise with myself after discussing my Dad/funding - I must try now to put it out of my mind until the time is right to face/cope with it.Mark\'s Collage - I could identify so much with his perfectionism, work drive and getting really bogged down with life and his own expectations of himself.It also rang alarm bells when I saw his structured almost perfect schedule for recovery.This is an area I am concerned about for myself - I lack spontaneity (?) in my life - spur of the moment events throw me.A lot to think about.I got up quite happy this morning, but my day went downhill quite          fast and I feel really shitty now, as I have wrote this letter to          Darren I know that what Darren is doing is wrong and that is the          addict, but I do really love the real darren cause underneath all          his shit he is a good person and that is what I want to see, I          just feel very upset and confused about the whole situation that          I am in.          One minute I am sure of what I am doing that\'s right, and then           a couple of hours later I start thinking is that right thing to          do then I change my mind I could go on all night and all day,          anyway I have spoke to Ryan tonight he is very happy, but when          I told him he has to go to school tomorrow he wasn\'t very pleased,          but he is going its only for 4 weeks then Its boarding school.          Also I have spoke to my mum she seems quite happy to.

'Paul\'s send off left me feeling it was going to be difficult to lose people as they move on to recovery, especially as Paul was such a warm person within the group.Justine\'s step one made me really feel for her and I could identify with her loneliness and pain surrounding some areas of her part.The Women\'s Group, my first, surprised me how such a small point raised could surface so many other issues.I could really identify with Rebecca\'s feeling\'s about anger and it made me feel very anxious about how I will cope when in the outside world.I know I really need to learn a different coping method, but worry how and where to start, so many areas I have become aware of.Better night slept from 2 am until 5 am.Felt very good when I got up.I feel very loving towards everybody.Robert came and did a group and then we had Anna-Kate\'s psychodrama which showed me what I must do with Jonathon and leave him here when I go before he kills me.Nicholas rang from Heathrow just to say he would be back Thursday but he would ring while he was away.Rowena and Amber could not come so Robert said Mel and I could go out.Charlotte rang to see when I would be home she misses me at church.And I miss my church so much.Went shopping had fun with Mel.Ash rang to see how I am and when am I going home.I miss them all very much my teeth hurt a lot.John S. chair gave me encouragement he has not had a relapse I hope have a good day tomorrow.Susan 1st step relapses.Rather made me think that could be me which is a good thing.Relaxation.Then Steve had his 1st step which I saw both my children with the drugs and the abuse that he talked about.John\'s life story my children did that all the time it is normal to me now.Julie\'s step one that was normal to be hit all the time as the children and Jonathon did it to me.Nothing shocks me at all even if you were to tell me that I was going to die I would not care any more.I think I am giving up!I don\'t want to but that is how it feels.I just want to run away all the time that\'s the only thing I know how.I am glad Romane is back he looked quite ill last night!I have still got a tooth ache I wish I could go and get my teeth sorted out.I just want to sleep but I am not able.',5,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.27,0,0,4.27,0,4.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.27,0,0,0,12.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.17,0,8.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.8,0,0,17.09,0,0,0,0,4.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.54,25.63,4.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.27,Female52
'We had Claire\'s P and U today.          The usual with good and bad points.          I felt sorry but she had to go to Nursing Station          even though this measure wouldn\'t have been taken          unless it was necessary.                    Had a problem identifying with Nicole\'s collage,          although she did it very well.          I didn\'t identify with obsessive behaviors although          alcohol is my obsession.          It flickered through my mind at one point, but at          the time all I could see was make-up, fitness,          clothes.          I was rather tired and wasn\'t concentrating enough.                    Carol gave her life-story.          That was really impressive and tragic.          I can identify with her very much.          Her husband is also a doctor, and she also an          addict.          I identify with her being powerless in her addiction          and marriage.          I really hope that we get our feet on the ground.                    I enjoyed today.          Had a chat with Amanda, and thanks to Graham, I          think I\'ll be labeled a compulsive helper before I          leave.          (I hope I\'m not taking this seriously!)          Played football.          Had a laugh.          Fun.          Was pleased  and very happy to know that the kids          are safe in London and are nearer to me for the next          ten days.          Dying to see them Sunday.Patience and to be passive - perhaps two of          the most difficult thing\'s to do for me.          Today I realized how close I came to the edge          just before coming here.            Thank God for having enough sanity and finding          a way to tell Gerry (from the very beginning of          our involvement)          Could not marry him till he has dealt with his          alcoholism, because there was no way I as          prepared to risk losing custody of Leonarda =          Her mother is in a unsuitable marriage for a          child to be brought up.          For me this is sheer horror of my addiction now          - not being aware  of risking the well-being of          my only child.          I do not wish to paint my self black, but truth          is it could have happened, and this is also a          big part of my fear attacks.          This was triggered off during Daniel\'s Step 1 and          part II group - to which extent I took on the          role of God upon my self, and I am so very          grateful for being able to identify and see the          addiction from all possible sides.          Without the helping hand of my higher power who          truly speaks to us trough other people, none          of this would have been possible.                    For today I value my self by starting to notice          how good efforts in my peers and making an          positive effort to be there for them.                    I suppose  it distresses me greatly to see to          what extent this illness eats away our soul\'s  -          my dear soul.                    I am so very grateful to be here!                    PS My fight has just started, and for today,          nothing is going to stop me from my recovery!I was worried about the play as soon as I woke up.          I knew all my lines but I still managed to forget half of them          I did have a laugh but I was so nervous, I\'m glad everybody          enjoyed them selves and that its over.          It was a very long day.          I rang my mom tonight to speak to Ryan and her but Ryan was at          his friend\'s, I said to mom not to come up tomorrow so that they          could have a Sunday at home she said she wasn\'t coming anyway, as          I had lied to her about Darren going she moaned about going up          and down to my house to feed the cats and that she was fed up          with it all.          And that I should make my mind up about what\'s going on.          I am trying to sort my head out, I feel that I am wasting time          but I am finding it very hard to make decisions about it my head          just feels so confused.Today has been excellent.                    I got good feedback from my peers which was          really nice to hear that they thought I was          doing well.          The relationship group was good and I found it          interesting to actually put on paper how I feel          about them.          I enjoyed spending some time with Margarita\'s          daughter.                    The gremlins drawing group was excellent and I          found it amazing to be able to express          myself in a way that I haven\'t be able to do          before.          I must admit I did feel a bit raw afterwards.                    Tomorrow I\'m moving to the woodpecker which came          as a shock to me as I didn\'t think that I would          be.          I have mixed feelings about this as I get set          in my ways and don\'t like change.          Better the devil you know than the one you          don\'t.          Also the fact that I going to have to be          responsibility for myself not bingeing.          I hope I\'m strong enough.          Ken also said that I would be here for about 3          weeks then I should go to day care.          I am pleased about this but there are many          fears that I have never even contemplated.          I have also realized that I\'m going to have to          tell people that I\'ve been in treatment and I          don\'t know how I\'m going to handle this or what          there reaction will be.          I\'m also worried about my relationship with my          father because I find it so difficult I feel          that it could push me to the edge and cause me          to start using on my feelings.          How do I untangle myself?          Please help me with this as I don\'t even know          where to begin!                    I feel good tonight and it\'s not an over-the-          top feeling.

Felt sorry even though it was necessary that she is          not allowed to go upstairs because of the          perfectionism.          Gile\'s leaving ceremony.          Again sad to see another go, but glad he had          completed.          Louise did her 3rd life story which went really          well.                    I was proud of her, because although she was hesitant at          one point she managed to complete.          Went down to Goodnestone.          Was fun or reasonably so, until after completing our          \"small exercise\" which Titus organized.          I was responsible to have the answers to the          questionnaire left outside counselors\' office.           Both Emma and Juliette had left their answers on the          table.          Steve and Carol (and somebody else) were still in the          dining-room completing.          I don\'t know why I started reading Juliette\'s reply.           Bloody stupid of me.          Steve got angry because I was reading something          confidential.          Well that hit me on the head and I said I would tell          Juliette which I promptly did and apologized.          She was pretty pissed off.          I felt so ashamed.          I had broken her confidentially by reading it.          But what blew my top was Steve\'s allegation over          supper that there was someone untrustworthy in the          group.          It was and intimidating and told peers he was          referring to me, and told peers about the above.          I am very resentful to him because it was not a          confrontation.          upset.Wake-up at 6 am and felt hopeful about the day, grateful to be abstinent from sugar and white flavor for nearly 3 weeks.Still, felt scared about my insurance not getting back to me.Felt invaded by the number of people meditation was so full and it felt getting of the tub when leaving the room.Felt a lot listening and identifying to Roland Step 1 and how horrible and powerful this disease is.Went for a walk hoping my stomach will work as I have been constipated for a week.Bet part of the day was Ken\'s group and to look at cross addiction, also that there were far less people a really good meditation where everyone shared, felt for Lisa\'s cravings.Felt awful after feeling concern for Jade and her food, but have to not take the negative feelings on board.I meant it caring as I was going into anorexia when I left Promis.Missing all ready Ioli.Felt sad to speak with Nelly that she was having problems already.Hate this food disease.Allow myself to have a massage and show my body.',3,-4,0,2,5,0,6.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,6.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.29,0,0,0,6.19,3.1,0,0,10.84,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,1.55,0,41.81,0,4.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.2,0,0,6.19,0,0,0,0,0,3.1,0,3.1,0,0,0,18.59,12.39,0,3.1,0,0,6.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.1,Female52
'Feeling very tired this morning, kept waking up in the night.Hate myself to take up smoking today.Find the process group short, wished that we had it a bit longer.Felt anxious going to Dover, but felt safe with Ioli, Spyros and Lisa and enjoyed being relax and not having cravings for food or alcohol, but had coffee and had stomach pains since, feel I am very blown up an fat.Fear that my weight is stable.Feel hurt about the little I hear from my family and my sister being so angry toward me, I know I have hurt her over my behavior and lying.Felt for Jade when couldn\'t eat her sandwich but didn\'t want to be the policewomen.Had a good share with Marilyn, but envious that I don\'t have someone out there waiting for me only a lonely flat and no future.I am feeling sad for Roland + Daphne and wish I could start feeling something.Can\'t get in touch with my feelings for Step 1.Just a bit isolated and impatience with myself.The most significant thing for me today was coming here apart          from that I don\'t really know how to express how I feel, except          for very nervous and afraid, but also that everybody here          seems to understand to some extent how you feel and that to me          is significant. Felt very restless in group and not really in touch with my feelings at the moment, also very sad to see Kathy back in treatment after seeing her in NA for the past years and also having the same friends.Felt relief that Adrian told Justine to stay and not go to Canterbury and see Sheila.Two friends back in treatment in the same day.Feel very sad!Enjoyed the lecture but not the group.had a good walk and to make amends to Fiona talking behind her back, felt very moved listening to Angie\'s life story and how sad.Cried all along the movie, crying for myself and the pain of getting sober.just feel very empty and drained being to bed.Want to run from all this pain and relapse.Wondering if I can make it this time around!Shared with Nick but unfortunately not with Linda.Feel I am quiet superficial sometimes around people here.Can\'t be unable and angry that I have put on the weight.While writing this I am in a particularly bad mood and I am          not sure why in fact a few things have upset me this evening          and for some reason they have upset me more than usual.          This morning we had Des\'s leaving ceremony and I am really          going to miss her.          We also had Malachy\'s step one which was emotional and brought          up feelings with me about not liking myself or my \'low self          esteem\'.          I think everybody could identify with parts of the step one          and I think everybody was very heartened by Malachy\'s honesty.          In the afternoon we had Lynn\'s collage which brought up a lot          of things for Lynn and she was very upset but I think it          cleared her feelings but I could identify with her feelings          over Darren having had a one-sided relationship myself.          We also had Susan\'s life story and I can\'t write anymore          because me head is too full of other things.          Sorry again!

'Lyn\'s step one part two was very good I could identify with the isolation and the inability to go out from I am not sure if she meant acrophobia which I had when I was drinking.Then there was the process group I felt sorry for Anna-Kate with her fear of sex.She seems to think once she gets out of here she has to jump in to bed with a man life is not like that It is up to her not what everyone else is doing she has lead such a sheltered life poor girl she is so easily upset she has to harden up like Julia and Alistair.As for Steve he thinks he is so tough I should have told the group his only reason for having a go at me was because Nicholas looked at his so called girlfriend he even offered to phone a friend in London to sort Nicholas out and I said he had miss understood what I had said which he had.Just because he has never had a true friend I have trusted Nicholas with my life never mind a car and a few house plants.So if he did have my bank card he would never use it without telling me or asking me rather.I feel so intimidated by Steve he is foul mouthed at every AA meeting and when no one else is around I have not come here to hear the same thing as I was getting from my children and ex-husband.I am going as soon as I can get in touch with Nicholas and the home office to say I am coming home.Steve even lost it in his collage he didn\'t even do that himself he got Louise and Giles to do it with and for him and then stood there as if he had done it himself.Anna Kate lets him walk all over her he lays on the dining room table and shouts she never says a word he mocks the staff all the time says they are no good.Only Robert is any good in his eyes he says he will only talk to Robert because the staff here are no good what chance have I got every time he opens his mouth it is pure filth that comes out.Got in touch with Mark said I would be out tomorrow so I have got Russel looking after me when I get back to Godalming.Nicholas is coming at 12 MD at least I will have some friends around me.Yes I will go to meeting in Midhurst or I could go to Guilford see how I feel.Process group.Very anger I want to shout but I can\'t.Lynn\'s life story video which I could not even hear.OA meeting I don\'t know what is wrong with me.Today\'s session began with meditation which left          a lot of food for thought.          One, that there is no conformity, and no rigid          rules to the way we live our lives.          I feel optimistic that also, there are no          standard rules to live in peace.          I was very impressed from all discussions, and          talks given by Nicole and Bernard how one can get          so disillusioned by life that we end up doing          things that damage us and decide to brave the          fight to correct our problems by using methods          that do not challenge the reality of the          situation.          I feel that we all need the courage to face our          insecurities, and the only way to make positive          changes, is to oppose the things that weaken us,          namely our dependencies, such as alcohol and          drugs.          I still have to further understand the dilemma of          a bulimic or anorexic.          These also seem to be conditions that arise          when we are incapable of handling a situation.           Again, pointing to a state of insecurity.          It also seems that all these bad habits have          formed unintentionally - and then forming a          dependency.          I feel with our own strength of character, will          power, understanding we can all fight our          dependencies.Started the day feeling low, felt I would see how the week went, but couldn\'t see me lasting the program. The process group was very intense and felt very drained afterwards.Emma-Jane\'s Step 1 made me reflect on many areas of my past.Decided I should ask to have some time with Linda and felt relieved after some anxieties I hadn\'t intended to raise came out.Still feeling tearful, yet better for speaking with Linda, was asked by Adrian to do my Life Story.Rebecca and Justine were really supportive and could see my panic, they tried to assure me it would be OK and only to disclose what I felt comfortable with. As it worked out, one are which I decided was too painful to disclose surrounding my termination of pregnancy did surface and I felt still ashamed but glad I had brought it out in the open.The group were really supportive in their questions and identification.I still can\'t seem to really face my feelings now - talk and identify in groups where I can muster the courage, but can\'t touch it.I know I am expecting too much of myself, but seem unable to call up and still feel very unhappy with me.Linda sorted out about drink/bath which has allayed a couple of things I had been worried about.Found today tough, but glad I\'ve broken the ice with the group.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.31,0,2.15,0,0,0,0,2.15,5.38,0,0,5.38,0,0,0,5.38,0,0,0,0,1.08,2.15,0,2.15,31.2,0,2.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.27,0,0,9.69,0,2.15,0,2.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.6,15.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.3,0,0,4.31,Female52
'I am feeling horrible, evil and angry with myself the morning felt ok and felt for Michael and to identify with his Step 1 and the powerless around the using.Just feeling so drained by this disease and the mess I have got myself into and how reliable I am on my family to get me out of financial situations and how I resent them to still be there.Enjoyed walking  with Spyros, Michael and Nick and having coffee and feel content without using.Came back to an amazing and honest collage from Marilyn.But, after that everything went wrong by trying to go up to London tomorrow and take the train early in the morning, but spoke with my sister and she wasn\'t ready to see me only in Canterbury so going to call her at 8 am to find out I want her to come and take me out.Don\'t want to spend my birthday in treatment, just want to run, but no way to go.Just feel so lost and scared about my behavior and manipulation.Just isolated the rest of the evening but grateful for Michelle support and was able to cry.George\'s Peer Evaluation made me feel panicky - could I make the grade as a good communicating member of the group - had I got what it takes?  Although the observations by others surprised me, it was assuring to hear and see the obvious concern for George.Adrian\'s talk as both interesting and enlightening, made me realize more about how much others in the addicts family suffers.  Felt guilty around my own problems affecting others, whereby I have been hurtful as a form of defense when they are only concerned.I felt hurt by a couple of comments made by others at breakfast which brought back memories - spoke to Justine and Rebecca about this.After seeing Amanda and Linda I felt annoyed at myself for allowing my health to deteriorate, realizing now that I have ignored this side - try not to think about it because when I do I feel frightened.Have plucked up courage to ask Rebecca to join me for a walk.During Alice\'s step one, felt very sad for her could identify some of her pain - expressed as best I could - but at least I said something.I acknowledged my STILL PRESENT feeling of I should still be able to sort this problem myself - but I know in my heart I can\'t.Will try to stop worrying about the and leave it in Amanda\'s capable hands.Process group Claire is so ill and she knows it.She is using it and will end up in hospital.That is what she wants.Nicholas had lots of news I wish I could have gone back with him so I could have gone to my church tonight I miss it so much.He is not keen on me going back to Portugal for winter but I would be with friends Pastor Carlos and Helena also I would see Rowena I would be all right.He could come over in the company jet so I see no problem I could still work the program there and if it did not work I could come back to Godalming.What lovely flowers he gave me but forgot to bring my present wonder what it is this week.Amber wants to come and see me but I don\'t wish to see her because she is sleeping with Jonathon and I don\'t want him to know I am here because he will ask for more money and I have said no.I will ring Harriet and thank her for the book which Nicholas forgot to bring.He had to get back for church at seven pm.Beth has had a relapse so I will write to her she is at Farm Place according to Nicholas I do miss them all.She was going to be my sponsor not now that\'s out.I will never get one I will have to stick with the Holy Spirit.I see the farmers are busy here it reminds me of when I was little my father never had time for me in the summer anyway I was away at school most of the time.I can\'t remember the new persons name she is very young I must be the oldest person here but I don\'t feel old yet.Ella has gone again I shall pray for her.Lyn looks so sad I have asked her if she is all right.Mel wants to die I know the feeling.My stomach is so sore I am sure I have an ulcer!I feel interested about Claire I cant see what she has to gain from all this.I am looking forward to the zoo it should be fun hope it is a dry day I had a wonderful sleep last night bet it won\'t happen tonight.Des and Julie are obsessed with talking about sex or rather which one can shock the other most I would have thought it was rather the lack of it I often think what is everyone thinking here what is going on inside their brain I would love to know.But no one will tell I will write to Beth.Then ring Harriet!Slept very well woke up feeling very sad thinking about Alastair and Julia and my church.Church is not the same here I have to go to church as soon as I get home.Don\'t know when that will be.I feel homesick today I don\'t know why.Mels life story I could relate to the rape it was terrible!I can still hear Julia crying I now feel brain dead at times and the mental treatment centers I also see Julia and Alastair in her life story.Emma\'s step one part two I could understand the rows how the children would cry when Jonathon would shout at me every day.And at night and also the shoplifting but I would never do it out of need I had plenty of money to pay for whatever I took but that does not make it any different at all.If anything it is worse.AA meeting now I feel like a drink after not drinking since February 1994 what next.Julie wants to go home.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,3.74,0,0,0,0,0,1.87,0,0,0,0,6.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0,0,1.87,0,3.74,0,0,0.94,2.81,0,0,0,9.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.81,1.87,27.14,0,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.62,0,0,2.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.87,0,0,0,4.68,7.48,3.74,1.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0,0,0,Female52
'The Process Group was tense and I could identify with George\'s feeling of guilt.It reminded me of how I feel responsible for others moods, always blaming myself if someone is down - I always think I must have done something wrong.Les\' Step 1 really made me think back to my relationship and realize how I needed to have a relationship no matter how harmful or detrimental it may be.Not sexually, but emotionally I was very needy.E-Janes Collage was very powerful and I could identify with her wanting to find a balance of priorities in her life for recovery.I feel very thoughtful around my marriage and what the future holds.I feel this morning so very angry with my self.          Why is it so unbearable to be loving and kind          towards my self.          Why do I feel so mad for respecting this soul of          mine, why so frightened.          Why don\'t I feel happy for standing up for my          self and putting my principles first -           What on earth is wrong with that?          What do I so desperately need to feel bad about          my self - Why do I need to feel I am lovable just          because somebody else is loving me regardless of          how much the way of loving me is hurting.          What do I have to lose my being happy and          peaceful.          Perhaps the answer is - I will have to let go of          my illness, my crazy thinking, my hatred of my          self.          Paradoxically, those are the things I want the          most to get rid of in life - I have to be free of          them, I want to stop giving them           I find to let go to them.           It feels as if I am going to trough a grieving          process.           I want to cry over them, to protect them to make          it easier for them to leave me and give me peace.          Is this not crazy and irrational?          Is that not so very stupid?          I do not want them any more, and I do no know how          to let them go! It is hurting me, so much, so          very, very much.          The video was very good.          Father Martin\'s speech touched me deeply.            How grateful I felt afterwards how full of          faith and hope.           This afternoon I used one of the tool\'s given to          me  - instead of sleeping at the nursing station,          I started to write (for the first time ever) a          letter to Gerry.          Then I poured out my heart to Sussanah - all          those deep feelings I could not tell          anybody.          She was very kind and supportive.          She know how to listen and how to let me cry.          I feel, I have been extremely lucky to have her.                    This evening\'s service at Nonington was blessed          as ever.          The reading was from Isaiah - Peter being told to          go out and serve and how he would 3 times deny          the Lord.          I so very much want to be of service to my fellow          human beings.Woke-up with the tanor saying happy birthday and was touched by the card and greeting at breakfast.Felt happy and grateful to be here and have the possibility to get my abstinence.Identified with Amanda and her food obsession.Enjoyed lecture and the process group, and how caring Robert is toward everyone.Had a lovely walk and was pleased that my constipation was relieved.Felt and identified so much with Daphne\'s life story and the pain she told very honestly.Had a horrible conversation with my step father, where he was ice-cold, and told me he will cut me of financially as he is fed up with my relapses.Had a angry conversation with my sister and she send me a cactus, start crying  and felt sorry for myself.Enjoyed the rest of the evening but just I didn\'t get a card from my family.Yesterday Gerry (once again) lied to me and          when confronted admitted it.          The good news is I still managed to have a          good nights sleep, having decided to talk to          Robert - must admit it felt that there was a          \"father\" there for me to whom I can turn to in          moments of need.          It was a most beautiful and peaceful feeling,          which I have not had for many a year.                    Roberts suggestion coincided with the lesson          (for today) from the psycho drama - heads and          tails are same  in their mutual opposition on          the same power - we could at least try to aim          for something in between, and not give our          power away.          It is hard and difficult to be \"to thine own          self be true\" as Shakespeare puts it, but at          least one could try and never stop trying.                    It was interesting to play Romans step-mother          for two reasons: I could for a moment put my          self in the place of Gerry\'s ex-wife and their          23 year old daughter Marta.            There seems to be a \"big money\" issue there,          especially if dad re-marries and even worst if          he starts a new family not to mention the new          wife\'s child from her first marriage.                    The other aspect of this particular part of Ps-          drama was putting myself in the wife\'s role and          trying to feel how would it feel if I was (and          probably am) concerned of my own child\'s          welfare and how will Marta relate to her...                    Last night, I could not help but be present in          the staff\'s dining room to a very long          telephone conversation  between Louise and her          father - he is giving her a real hard time, and          as I am writing this SES in the same place          tonight the same is happening.          Perhaps this is none of my business, but my gut          feeling is, Louise need\'s help and not to talk          for very long periods of time on the phone to          her father.

'I get up feeling great and as the day creeps on it is as if a cloud comes over me.By lunch I feel like a Time bomb about to explode with anger frustration pain self pity.There is no God here at all.All I want to do is get better as quick as I can sort out my teeth put an end to solicitors by paying Jonathon off once and for all which I have instructed the solicitors to do today sort out maintenance get rid of the men in my life find out if I am  a compulsive helper which I think I am.I am not worried about my weight now I am whatever I weigh now because I feel right now I am on a good diet three meals a day now and nothing between meals.Anyone would diet if they had two children shouting at them for years saying I was a fat slag and a drunk which I was but I no longer drink and I accept the fact I am powerless over my life and the outcome of what has been the outcome with my children.Giles leaving ceremony he will do well as long as he keeps up the meetings and works the 12 steps.I am glad I told Nichol about helping herself to my food because I am sick of people walking all over me.I feel I should not have told her but I am glad I did.Nichol\'s peer evaluation Ivanka got on my nerves keep reading over my shoulder so I told her maybe I should have kept my mouth shut but it is my turn now I am here for me and no one else.Nichol took it well but one cannot take it personally it is for ones own recovery.Lunch everyone complaining about food.Another letter to Solicitors about shoplifting court dates.I was not aloud to go for a walk with the others.Louise life story she is so young to have gone through so much.Overeating meeting tonight.At last there is a God here.Today we had to write about our higher power.How safe and strong the morning was by having Robert here, and the process group was excellent.Felt and identified with Rob family situation.Feel that I am having too much food on my plate, lunch and dinner especially when I am on calorie control, and I don\'t want to deprive myself from the puddings as I did that last time, and never used fat.But then I hear people putting on weight and it scares me that I am maintaining.Shared with Nelly and Trudy, cat in the front lounge and realize how much I will miss Nelly, but our HP got us together here, as I lost contact with her for 5 years, and then we meet up in Promis and not in a sweet shop.Felt a bit bad not taking my mother\'s call and then tried to call her but didn\'t get hold of her.Did talk with her and it went fine.Felt for her that my brother went to the treatment.Felt happy for Spyros and Nigel had a good week-end.I can\'t remember about this morning we had relaxation and I fell asleep.Steve\'s step one I could relate to the drinking because of the loneliness and people wanting you for what you could give them.I feel sad because Ivanka is leaving as I have been able to talk to her.AA meeting tonight.Pat a friend rang up to see how I was and she was so kind.A mixed day.     Feeling angry, just about little things for The first time in     ages ( feels like a good sign but I don\'t like it )!     Felt worried today about people here liking me and I know this     is a big part of my problem, wanting desperately to be liked all     the time.     In group goals today I felt a little upset that people didn\'t     have more positive feedback.     For me - Billy seemed to get heaps and he has been here for the     same length of time - I know this is a big insecurity of mine.     My mind is telling me that I\'ll still occasionally be able to eat     cakes or drink wine and that I can just do it in moderation - the     program will help me.     I want very much for this to work for me and am beginning to feel     twinges of hope and even excitement.     Feel very worried about doing my life story.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.18,2.59,0,0,14.25,0,0,0,5.19,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,1.3,0,42.75,0,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,16.84,0,0,0,2.59,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.36,14.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,0,0,7.77,Female52
'I was so afraid this morning I don\'t know how I said a word but Anna-Kate told me you have to say something.I hope Steve will be all right but I am glad he has gone.Des step one I could relate to about her friendship with someone from a different class one would not get away with it in England never mind Multa.AA meeting tonight I am so tired.I am glad everyone has been so kind I find it hard to understand why people like me.Today\'s Group Process centered around Nick and          his problems with his parents.          I felt that he should develop a closer          relationship with his parents rather than          choose to go his own way - and he should seek          outside support to help him through the          difficulties he may encounter.          We also had a very interesting lecture from Ken          about \"mental states\" related to addictions.           If feel that nearly everyone could identify          with \"Anxiety\" as life is never problem free          and we all experience varying degrees of          anxiety, especially when we feel lost as to          what we should do to resolve difficult          situations.          I was very saddened to learn of Suzannah\'s past          history.          Her addiction started as a remedy for physical           relief before it became a dependency.          Since the dependency life had been going          down and down.          Her relapse has only made her situation          somewhat more depressive.                    I had not much to contribute to Ivanka\'s \"peer          evaluation\".          She hides her hurt and has not learned to          express.          She does not want to be vulnerable to hurt and          has a great strength in her character, which I          feel will see her complete recovery.          After the evaluation she has opened up to us          all, rather than controlling.          I also feel good and reassured of my position          here, as I watch the rapid progress of Claire          who is contributing and has become very          assertive, always honest, and eats well.          AND Louise who seems to be a lively girl who is          doing her best to fight the torment of          memories.          Bringing them to the open.  I\'m happy to be          here!Feeling very sad at the thought of Jo going, she has been so good to share with.The video brought a lot of feelings for me around how  my addictions affect Matthew.When the time came to ask for time in the Process Group, I just couldn\'t  find the words.Ken\'s saying `CONFUSED\' was a cop out word - I felt guilty all the way through the group hoping I would get the opportunity to share what was going on for me - that I was struggling with this help plan and that I was finding the food difficult and was fighting with myself, trying to search out the reasons why I still find it so difficult to ask and accept help.I know I try to push away the thought, I feel so uneasy on myself.I feel so lonely which seems really silly considering I am with so many other people in the house.Even when I do share I feel no relief and generally tense all the time.I am nervously talking and regretting what I say almost immediately after - I feel tearful and emotional, the realization of my addictions and where I am at now seems overwhelming and I fear I have what it takes to overcome them.As I am writing this I am thinking part of my confusion in myself is that I went Bowling and this is something I would normally have talked myself out of as it would be something seen as a `treat\' not allowable for me.Also I have put my name down for Reflexology - which although is for my health I still feel really guilty about spending the money.My day well I think that it was a very good idea about the          process group I am glad that I spoke about Darren and Ryan I do          know all the answers and what to do its just doing it I would          like some help I will talk to somebody tomorrow.          I feel really ashamed and guilty for what I have put Ryan through          and my mom.          Still its never to late to change.          I am sad that Louise has left, as we did have a long talk about          it the other night, but that\'s all I could do, she has made her          own mind up to leave.          I had a great afternoon shopping I haven\'t bought clothes like          that for years I really enjoyed it, but my money ran out, and          I still need jeans which is what I went for I was surprised at          how relaxed I felt and didn\'t have a panic attack as I never stay          in Canterbury for that amount of time I feel very happy tonight          and I am grateful that I am here.          I feel that I have walked around with my eye\'s glued together for          years, and that the glue is slowly peeling off.I have been deaf for years,          my hearing is coming back.          my mouth has been closed like a door          slowly opening up.',4,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1.15,0,0,2.31,0,0,0,10.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.46,0,0,2.31,0,0,0,2.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.31,21.92,0,3.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.69,0,0,9.23,0,2.31,0,0,0,0,0,2.31,0,0,0,0,20.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.69,Female52
'It is 7 pm and I am feeling very full and feel disgusted with myself that I eat the food pudding, I am  never going to lost the weight and I still could binge easily!I was so sad listening to the good-byes letters and felt very sad listening to the,.Also, feel very sad seeing Rob and Nelly leaving.Scared I won\'t see them again.Just don\'t want to do the letter of Joy of Recovery as I feel with recovery.Good to go for a walk, but felt a bit lonely and isolated since dinner.Expected to have more telephone calls or letters from friends.Feel envious of the anorexics, that they find it so difficult to eat!Still no visitors for the week-ends.Never shared with Debs or Roland even if I was picked in meditation.Feel like a tang, with no femininity or sexuality, just don\'t know who I am.Haven\'t started Step 1 as I am scared to look at it.Feeling low, and not sleeping very well keep waking up in the night.Woke-up at 5 am so felt tired and irritable all day and had cravings which makes me angry as I would have taken something to pick me up.Didn\'t identify in process group and just felt an outside.Sad to see Jimmy living but also hopeful.Felt hungry at all my meals, but enjoyed the walk!Like working in small group.Felt drained around 5 pm and then got very resentful at dinner when there wasn\'t any yogurt left for my pudding.Hated the anger and atmosphere at dinner and wanted to shout and tell people to be silent, it remind me of the nightmare meals at home were everyone is talking and not listening to each other.Grateful to OA where I could talk about body issue as I have harmed myself with very bad stretch marks, hate myself, thinking like that.Felt for Spyros with all the anger tonight.Going to bed early! Didn\'t share with a & b.I feel unhappy and frustrated this morning.I am happy to make a positive approach to ask people to keep me company at mealtimes as my responsibility.But I do feel uncomfortable and awkward about their having to organize or sort out my meal.I also feel resentful that I was asked to rest on my bed in between groups.Firstly because I understood *  to `rest\' but not that I had to spend just 10 or 20 minutes perched on my bed, which feels far from restful and the fact that sometimes it made sense for me to just stay put until the next group started.Also I was told I could just sit in the office on the sofa which I did all over the weekend responsibly and now I\'m told not to.I do feel there is a lack of communication somewhere  and I felt I agreed to some guidelines which have now changed.Tal\'s Peer Evaluation left me feeling pain for him which I know directly reflects my worries around Matthew and his future.The similarities between Tal now and Matthew already is too close for comfort.Justine\'s Collage was very moving for me in subtle ways.The link between her mother representing love/food - my mothers idea was the same and she would like to `treat\' me to special things which I didn\'t really want and also to refuse food she had made was a real rejection of her care and affection.At school I didn\'t really try and would be terrified when it was report time as I always had several `could try harder\'.Something which I did do as a child, was the habit of pulling out my hair and tickling my face for comfort, but I never ate for comfort and I can remember my mom telling me I was always a worry to her as I was a problem with food - nervous sickness, stomach cramps, and generally far from easy for her.Feeling low this evening.\"God speaks to us trough other people\" - today          I understood the great secret of LISTENING.          \"We can listen to the voice of our higher power          in others\" - med. for women.                    Prayer!                    When there is a scary situation, or someone          accuses me of something unpleasant, I will not          show them how I feel, but  will later on my          own share with fear and up emotions.          Here, at Promis I feel safe, and even  when          there  are confrontations, they do not frighten          me enough, because they are dealt with in the          appropriate manner.                    Although I have hurt people in my life  I was           aware to some extent it was not  premeditated          and was willing to be the first to make up and          forget - worst part was when my attempts where          not accepted and when there was nobody to          support me; that is I feel abandoned.                    I am learning a lot about anorexia from Ana -          Kate with her on this \"iron  control\" aspect of          it and manipulation.                    With Nicole I have identified a lot about the          \"perfection\" and not being able to let go and          just simply enjoy my self.            Also, of wanting to be so perfect and not being          able to be and then feeling a failure and lazy.          There is also something about being or feeling          deprived of (especially) food and then really          craving for it, and a great difficulty to stop          projecting into the future.                    From my collage - there is a lot of pain          underneath all this control - as I have written          on the beginning of tonight Sesh. sheet it          seems I have to be frightened into feeling them          - like anything to do with Leonarda.          I would give my life for her, so she never has          to go through what I went to and had to endure.          Perhaps that is a problem - How about me?           Am I willing to let go of this illness and save          my own life first?          Am I wishing to embrace the dark in order to          survive?                    Beauty is a big issue for me - it could or          perhaps already is, a compulsion, as I tend to          see my own pain as lot easier to bear to some          other peoples pain.

'I was awake early this morning as Des was doing her collage, and          Nicole had a couple of bad dreams which woke me up, but I know          that she is worried about going home.          I have felt miserable today I have felt really down - low quite          uninteresting and boring and I\'ve felt that I have nothing to say          to anybody that\'s worth while talking about, I missed Des\'s          collage this morning so I don\'t know anything about that and I          have got a peer feedback to write about her and I have not got          a clue what to write about I had a walk around the garden with          Emma we both had quite a good chat, then I have been to the           A-Alon meeting, I did speak in there a couple of times I feel          more relaxed in there now I don\'t mind going there.Video called sleeping tiger just how right it was, I hope I never find out.Robert\'s lecture I am not sure what he was saying.I am angry I am a addict and angry with Jonathon for ',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.73,0,0,2.58,10.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.2,0,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.67,0,0,12.89,0,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.73,15.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.31,Female52
'Ivanka had a very good leaving ceremony.                    Lynn\'s Step One moved me.          Moved me to the point that I realized that I had not          filled in my cross-addiction correctly.          When Lynn gave her story it was like she pulled out          a Chapter of my life.          The incidents were not the same but the situations          were the same.          I then had to   with Amanda and decided that I          should re-do it again, with the help of Juliette.           Sometimes we found difficulty interpreting some of          the questions.          The result shocked me.          BUT I am relieved I have discovered it now.          On Tuesday, I should be doing PART II of Step 1.          I need to know what I\'m supposed to do now.          Besides that, it\'s been a good day.          Football, volleyball, Tea with Graham, Juliette and          Louise.Forgot to write one significant event sheet yesterday, as I forgot and start feeling resentful to be back, but at the same time I choice to come back.Hate being me and feel a very fake person by making efforts around my peers group.I can\'t believe the mess I got myself into and not been able to let go of the weight.Mostly, feel depressed and scared  that I am just here to run away and isolate.Feel a huge failure to be back and wonder if I have the willingness!Had food cravings and realizing that after not drinking for 3 years, I did and it was a really down, not able to get drunk.I suppose the morning wasn\'t a good start.          I had to cancel or rather postpone my appointment          with Graham as it was important to attend Process          Group.          This was necessary as there was a lot of bad feeling.           I sorted out with Juliette.          But I am avoiding Steve.          For now anyway.          For his behavior is not on.          I don\'t like bully behavior.                    Missed Emma\'s Step 1.                    Attended Claire\'s One Day In Life.          Think she may have gained trust in the group and          recovery.          She has been fairly positive through the day.          The day went well, until supper time and received a          card from my husband.          Seems outwardly nice enough but am skeptical.                    I don\'t feel I am ready to reply to his \"Do you Love          Me\"?  I also, didn\'t take easy to his undermining          the Higher Power, `specially since HP is vital to          the program and recovery!  Maybe his intentions          \'em.          I\'ll be avoiding the issue for the time being.I am still feeling very strange after my step 1 in fact I feel          a bit better now after going to AA in Dover but before I was          feeling very angry and upset.          I don\'t know where the anger came from except that during my          step 1 \'black outs\' were brought up and I have definitely          suffered from hazy nights however I am a Catholic and although          not perfect I felt very angry at the suggestion that during          these black outs I had slept with people or I might have slept          with people to get drugs - which I have never - defensive I          may be.          I do object to David\'s comment that now I had thought about the          black outs such things (as in sleeping with people) would come          back.          Well I might well have gone and done that but as of yet I          haven\'t and that is a very strong part for me.          - so there!          I don\'t know why I fixated all my anger on that  some of it          genuine definitely but I felt very enraged a bit too much for          that small point!          I feel particularly guilty after my step 1 but I couldn\'t cry          (well only a bit !)          Apart from that Marcus Life story led me to know more about          him and the goals group helped me to understand that I must          share my feelings more and discuss some of my problems          although that will be hard.

I will now really try to keep it in the day and share my feelings rather than feel my feelings /comments are insignificant and leave them unsaid.Did my first Peer Evaluation tonight, felt anxious not to offend/upset for fear of anger back at me - have tried to be honest but not people-pleasing.Feel apprehensive about the Goals Group as I know I have been struggling and it will be pointed out to me.Woke up at 3 am and couldn\'t fall asleep put my earplugs on and had to verify that what I had dreamed wasn\'t real.As I had a vivid using dream, I was trying to get into the kitchen, using the big knife to break down the door and Felt very  unsettle and scared in process group, when I wrote my letter to my food addiction, I felt completely numb and not felt anything, so scared that I still want to use!Had a really honest share with Ioli about relationships and how much we identify.Going to miss a  Rob and Nelly, but I know I will make sure to see them!Felt scared to find out that I am on maintenance but at the same time I don\'t want to have less as I will feel deprived, but scared.I will stick to my present weight.Get angry with my parents and sister that they keep calling and asking about my treatment.Anyway, still in the day!Felt grateful to be here today and how safe I felt to be part of the house and the disease  has been removed!It was a much day and with the unity of the group.Enjoyed Ken\'s lecture and especially around obsession toward men.Still, can\'t identified very much with compulsive helper group.Grateful to have done my Step 1 in a bigger group and having Amanda in it. Felt relief to get it done but realize how unmanageable my life is, and losing money weekly for the rental of a flat I am not living in.Enjoyed meditation and had a laugh, find it difficult to do a peer evaluation for Nick.Going to bed relief to clean  + sober.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.48,0,0,0,0,3.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.48,0,10.45,0,0,0,8.71,0,0,0,17.42,0,0,0,0,3.48,0,6.97,0,47.02,0,6.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,67.92,0,0,12.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.97,0,0,0,13.93,20.9,0,3.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female52
'Feeling very tired mostly all the time and just wondering around from the garden to meditation room.Feel unsettle and lonely and very isolated by being a overeater and grossly fat.Not much hope as I have cravings for chocolate but to ashamed to share about it.Miss Elizabeth in London who had a bit of  hope, and Clive just don\'t feel opening up again.Feel I am trying to hard to be like.Hate that I have taken up smoking!Enjoyed NA and took my first day clean key ring, even if I haven\'t taken illegal drugs, but my relapse in food in alcohol makes me feel on day  one as I can\'t be clean on one thing and not on other, as in NA they say alcohol is a drug.Have pain in my stomach, haven\'t had my period for over 3 years, maybe that\'s Miss London and friends, like usually I start felling scared and depressed when I get a few days cleanFeeling mixed emotionally - when I heard that something was obviously wrong in the house I felt sad as there has been a really good trust and strength in the group but I had felt concerned that rules were being bent in the house.After speaking to Dad last night to tell  him I\'d got a leaving date I was very surprised at how he was, I know I have only just touched the surface with our relationship and feel happy with that for now.In the Process Group I felt very attacked by what Nigel said, then when I thought back it helped me to identify the areas I am still finding difficult.At the time he confronted me I knew I had not done anything wrong, instead of saying just that I tried to justify, got defensive and dealt with the whole thing badly.I find criticism very hard to take and when I confront I sometimes get aggressive instead of assertive - or I am too passive, still have  a lot of work to do on this.I am finding it difficult to cope with all the thoughts and feelings around leaving, being GL and seeing people I\'d had a lot of hope for in recovery relapsing.I do feel positive for myself yet a little unnerved by it all.Clarissa\'s Collage was very disturbing to hear in that I feel she is still very unsure of herself, although I did see some hopeful signs.I feel very under pressure tonight as I write this as I seem to have lots of paperwork and so much going on in my head - I could feel I was getting stressed.Put myself back to ground, made a mental list of what priorities HAVE to be done tonight and will leave what I can until tomorrow.Today, after my Part 2 of Step 1, I am in a          state of shock and also furious - furious          because I (once again) want to make sure to          everybody to what extent I am powerless over          food.          But \"everybody\" are telling me I am not!!!          I do know how terrified am of the stuff and          how many times I have said \"never again\" and how          many tears I have cried because I could not be          there for Leonarda.          Perhaps, I am furious at my self for never          seeing the connection           Actually I do not know what is it I meant to          say.                    I am very grateful for all confrontations          Never before have people cared enough to take          time and pointed some character treats to me.          How do I feel about staving Leonarda, trough my          own lack of food?          How do I feel about screaming at her and          instead of taking time off from work, just          giving her a cuddle?                    How do I feel about, almost hurting her?          Or leaving her behind and going on a two week          holiday with Gerry?          Or taking her away from her father?          How do I feel?          How does Ivanka feel?                    She did not feel - she just simply survived.          She did not want to, not the way it happened.Well, my day started with emotions manifesting          tough very bad \"nervous stomach\"           (Its all too do with letting go of Gerry)          So after a good cry and after talking to Dawn and          some of my peers it stopped and now I (only)          have a headache.                    Clare\'s Step I was very revealing for me, because          I could identify with the fear of change (as I am          going trough it right now) and how powerless I am          over my illness.                    Graham is playing tonight Beethoven\'s I and it is          magic - this was the first piece of classical          music I was ever given in a form of a 33 rpm          record at the age 15 in Lagrers from my first          serious boyfriend.                    There is a lot of talk (around the house) about          Steve\'s outburst during the process group - the          man is time - but are his behavior and his language          acceptable?!          What could be done about it on a practical level,          as he has not right to go on insulting the food          disorder peers - as so happens.          I think be better take a good look at his own          \"hoarding\" of food and huge platter\'s before          Mandy\'s visits!?            Little boys do have to grow up just as we little          girls have to - by our own efforts regardless how          much we dislike it.                    This may sound a bit sarcastic but I suppose I am          trying to tell you how angry I am.                    I am grateful to be here.',3,-5,0,1,5,0,0,0,2.14,2.14,0,0,0,2.14,0,1.07,0,4.28,0,2.14,0,0,0,6.43,0,0,1.07,0,0,0,0,8.57,0,0,0,2.14,0,0,0,4.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.07,0,35.34,0,8.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,53.55,0,0,4.28,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,0,4.29,0,0,0,18.21,18.21,4.29,0,0,0,4.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.07,0,0,2.14,Female52

'When I woke up this morning I felt very sad and miserable, the          weather was dull and that\'s just how I felt.          It did brighten up as the day went on, I found the group this          morning to start off with quite stressful but after it got going          it was OK.          John\'s life story was very interesting, and also Julie\'s step 1          was so sad the way that her life was and the things she had to          do and what she put up with, but then again I can see how her          life was similar to mine I put up with so much shit and verbal          abuse and the violence but I couldn\'t see any way out, but luckily          I have got out of those terrible relationships and I don\'t ever          want to be like that again.           I couldn\'t speak to Romain today I cant even say what my feelings          where, I do know I was scared to talk to him, also it hurt me.          I managed to talk to him on the bench about 9 o\'clock tonight we          had a cuddle and I had a few tears (what\'s new) I do feel a lot          better now.          Darren rang me tonight about Ryan\'s bike it needs fixing.          He has been so nice to me since I have been here.          Its a pity he wasn\'t like that after the car crash, perhaps I          wouldn\'t be here if he had stayed with me, instead of running away          and using more and more heroin.          I now know that he loves the brown powder more than me and I cant          compete with it.          He will get my letter tomorrow morning, and my mum will have          hers.          I had a really nice day with my friends in fact it gave me a lot          of encouragement they came down for lunch which was          questioned.          I didn\'t realize we had to tell the kitchen by Wednesday.          I wanted my friend Sarah to come down because she has been to          see Robert about her anorexia so I wanted her to come and see          how nice and friendly it was here I did also mention it to          Robert and I thought it might give her some inspiration for          the future.          I really enjoyed myself and it was nice to see how interested          my friends are in my recovery and how much they care.          I went to church afterwards I could really see a future for me          afterwards.          I want to let go of the past and stop punishing myself which          is in a way what I have been doing and then I feel that I am          letting my father down which is silly because I know he would          want me to get on with my life.          Somehow I need to make my peace with him and that is the          bottom line. I didn\'t want to get up again this morning I still felt tired even          though I had an early night, felt the same as yesterday until I          was in group in Juliette\'s step one and as she was saying how she          felt it was just the same as me and I have spoke to her I am glad          I am not the only one feeling like that but I do know now that          a lot of people feel the same but at different times, I enjoyed          driving my car to the post office this afternoon, I also spoke          to mom she is much better towards me  now I feel that I can talk          to her more openly now, Ryan phoned later on he is happy we had          a good chat I am feeling more confident about saying no to him          now.          Also I rang my sister and had a good talk with her, so everybody          is quite happy at home, and I feel relaxed that I am not the only          one feeling like I do.          My second night of good sleep, regardless of          everything  - now that is (also) recovery.          My first step - Part one, has good for me.           It gave me the courage to accept the          powerlessness over the addiction and to see the          anorexic part too.                    Nicole\'s life story revealed to me how a          relationship can provide a \"fix\" - and I am          very grateful for that too, feeling there is          much more to my relationship with Gerry and it          is a good acknowledgment (tough love?!)           Time and help my higher power will tell.                    Although each day I deal with so many painful          issues my natural optimism and good will          towards my fellow man are slowly but surely          coming back, and so my self esteem,          assertiveness and sensitivity.          I am, now, finding my self in a place where          demanding life is the best possible thing I can          do.          This evening when talking to Gerry his state          did not change mine - I acknowledged his          problems, but once I  managed to stay lovingly          detached.          This morning, I reached out for help and acted          on advice - organized for my girlfriend Natasha          to bring Leonarda this Sunday for a visit,          rather than my husband.          There are may painful and still   issues          regarding him, over marriage and his abusive          language when I asked him for a divorce.          It was showing some one could be so full of          pure venom to one\'s 18th partner.          I just completely blocked off the emotions          regarding that particular incident but it is          obvious to me to what extent I was hurt by his          outburst and accusations.                    I must confess I feel quite happy to see the          real face of this illness called addiction - at          least now one can use the given tool\'s and          start fighting the monster, and LIVE  and          LOVE!                        \"The true will is to do,               What one does not want to do\"                                     GI Gurdnieff',4,-5,1,1,5,0,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,7.2,0,0,4.12,0,8.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,2.06,0,2.06,0,0,2.06,0,4.12,0,0,0,4.12,0,0,1.03,0,13.39,0,4.12,0,0,0,4.12,0,0,49.42,0,0,0,0,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,2.06,0,0,0,1.03,36.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,10.29,Female52
'Had goals and felt that I didn\'t have much to say about my peers.Only felt inadequate around my English.Got to go for a slow walk but got to know a bit better Carol and why she is here.Getting a lot of identification with Ioli and got a lot of sadness in the women\'s group but also felt tremble  since as I realize all my relationships has ended badly and got left.I feel I take everything out of a man like bingeing with food or using all the drugs available in one time.Had cravings since group and wanting to overeat at dinner even thinking about stealing some bread, but didn\'t.Just feeling so disappointed with myself and envious of Jade youth and control around her food feel like a big fat ugly woman.Want to stop smoking!Just feeling like running, felt bad and jealous around my sister and how she talks to me a bit down.Bernard left a void.          Most of the wit and humor has gone.          Every time someone leaves it\'s like someone in the          family left.          We\'ll be feeling the same effects tomorrow when          Suzannah leaves.          Her 1st step relapse left concern in me how such a          strong character as Suzannah didn\'t do the right          thing to prevent relapse.          What I learned with her is that isolation encourages          a relapse.          I fear relapse, because it could be caused by a          number of reasons.                    Steve was such an encouragement.          He delivered in honesty and with Steve\'s style a          great step I am Powerless.          It reminded me of my preparation for Step 1 and will          complete my preparation for Friday/Saturday as Sunday will          be Visiting Day.                    Unfortunately, it has been a fairly empty day, the          weather and too many people having had felt.          But it was not a bad day.          No outside influences.          Concentration within the day.          Good video on recent plays.Feeling very mixed today - spoke to Dave last night all is OK for the weekend.I was half expecting him to say it was all off as I know in the past I\'ve ruined potentially good things and he would rather not do anything.He surprised me, he sounded quite enthusiastic - I am excited and yet beginning to get panicky.Mentioned about my not being able to have the white flour and sugar, then worried I was making a fuss, rather than stating my needs.Talked with Fiona and feel more at ease about it - I have not been doing \"NORMAL\" things for so long!Kate\'s group was very moving, I found it hard to listen to and it reminded me so much of the sadness I felt the loneliness I forced upon myself and the sheer madness of my progressively worsening behavior.It took so much freedom away from me.I was so pleased to hear I\'d been given a leaving date  - at the same time I felt a pang of feeling I will really miss everyone.I am very apprehensive about it all BUT I do believe it is nearing the time to move on.Being is going to be tough an very good practice for me - I am aware I need to delegate and will work at doing a good job BUT not doing it all myself.Although I hated every minute of the ASKING FOR HELP exercise Ken suggested it really helped me see what a problem it was.Also feeling happy about the possible Aftercare/Helpers Group I know how important this is to me.Feelings all over the place tonight HAPPY, SAD, PANICKY and EXCITED.Today, I have felt isolated by all the pain of addictions in my fellow peers!Felt like crying when I heard about Elia and her pregnancy as what I want most is a child myself.Felt overwhelmed by Spyros collage and just could tell him, felt like running from him as feeling so inadequate after listening to him, then  life story and how grateful he is that he has the opportunity to be here.Felt cravings and can\'t accept that is ok to be here after receiving a fax about my insurance, so want to leave as I don\'t feel that it is right for me to be here, especially when I have been here before!It has completely throw me and can\'t let go.Came late for dinner and been very snappy toward Trudy  I know I don\'t feel part of it - just scared!Gone to NA',3,-4,0,2,5,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.26,0,3.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.94,5.26,0,0,10.51,0,0,0,1.31,2.63,0,1.31,5.26,38.09,0,6.57,0,2.63,0,0,5.26,0,61.75,0,0,3.94,0,0,0,0,2.63,5.26,0,2.63,0,0,0,11.82,23.66,0,0,2.63,0,6.57,0,0,1.31,0,0,0,0,3.94,0,0,5.26,Female52
'What a day.Letter from Barlows to say I should be in court tomorrow for sentence.I didn\'t even know I had pleaded guilty I was on so many drugs but I must have done if they say so.Then my step one hope it is over a done with not sure yet.Don\'t know what to do where to go.Or stay.I feel so strange without taking any tablets I don\'t like the way I feel I know I must not have a drink but I would like one.I would love some chocolate but can\'t have any I wonder what next.Please don\'t tell me half way house after this because that would be the last straw.Also I want to ring the children I don\'t know why since the last time I saw them they tried to kill me and I had to call the police again.But I do want to talk to them.They could be dead for all I know.I haven\'t seen or heard of them since June I pray they are all right.So many new people here it is getting better.Woke-up at 5.30 am and felt sad and depressed until Ioli Collage where I suddenly realize how grateful to be alive, specially when I think with the men  I have slept with without using condoms.I realize that I was taking risk just to please them.Ioli was and is my closet friend here and with whom I identified best with.Didn\'t identify with compulsive helping group, but went as my name was on the list.The a very powerful peer group,Sad to see Daphne leaving! First time, feeling cravings for sugar as I feel there is no one out there for me, and not having any future plans.Wish I could get back on Prozac as I feel down being abstinent.Good meditation, but a lot of sadness and seeing Jordan being scared.Grateful that the day is over and I can go to bed, just the past few days felt depressed.Couldn\'t share with Nick today and just a bit flate.I was in a very relaxed and calm mood this morning, as the day          went on I was getting more anxious about the card that Darren had          sent in, it was a belated birthday card it arrived at 8:30 and          I couldn\'t open it till 8:30 tonight and I just felt confused over          it, Ryan rang me up giving me a hard time about Darren having to          move out of the house saying how well they are getting on, and          how long are you going to be staying in here in the end he put          the phone down on me and I felt pretty sick as I was trying to          explain things to him but he wouldn\'t listen to me.          I was trying to tell Ryan how dangerous the situation was with          darren I told Ryan that as darren smoked pot (I couldn\'t tell him          he was using heroin), he knows Darren uses pot but nothing else          but he wouldn\'t listen to me.The atmosphere in the house is very unsettled at the moment, last night Stephen\'s airing of his desire to go disappointment at the Goals Group etc. Meditation last night made me go off to bed thinking about what was pending for today and I was anxious to find the right words and courage to say what I know I need to in the Process Group.At breakfast I was asked by Betty to validate Emma-Jane\'s toast at breakfast, but having myself been pulled up by fellow foodies knew her having her toast dry was not right.I did not feel it was my place to comment, offered to pass her the flora but she declined.  I spoke to Dawn who said I should mention it at Process Group if it become appropriate and that it had been raised before for E-Jane.I was really nervous to raise my point and take some time, so much that I even forgot to ask as we went around the group.So many other things came up that I almost talked myself out of saying it - but I did and felt glad I had faced it.Alice\'s Peer Evaluation raised a fear for me that I had been avoiding that I need to address HRT/Body image etc while here.I could identify with Jo and her projecting others reactions, creating fear without knowing what may happen.I can see so many driving, perfectionist signs in  Jo it frightens me, but gives me hope that she can and is accepting them, even though she is still unaware where to start.It was the first feedback I had even been in and I was unsure quite what to expect.I was a little disappointed that I was not given my Step 1 to do as part of me wanted to get  a `foot on the ladder\' but sensibly I know I am not quite ready yet.  The artwork has given me a lot to think about, I think I recognize the need to face the here and now - challenge that - before worrying about what is going to happened after PROMIS.The Helpers Group was very useful, I could identify so many feelings.It also raised so many feelings of situations that I had not even thought of as being relevant.I have a lot to think about around this area.',4,-4,0,1,5,1.08,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,2.16,4.32,0,0,0,10.8,0,2.16,0,0,0,0,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,0,5.4,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,2.16,0,27,0,4.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.2,0,0,9.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.32,0,0,0,0,16.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.16,Female52
'The first part of the morning started with the video which          actually I found quite boring which could be due to the fact          that I couldn\'t see it properly, but it was called \"quit\" and          I thought the speaker sidetracked the subject and didn\'t          understand his own thought and his compulsion to write \"world          of chemical dependency\" many times on his board Sorry.          After this I was in Barnaby\'s step 2 of step 1 and I thought          it was very emotional and thoughtful and all feelings were          shared among the group, I felt I could identify within some of          his addictive behavior with drugs and that he was relieved to          get some of the feelings off his chest.          After lunch I went to the country club and exercised, on          return we had process group and apart from discussing          Romain\'s departure which I felt very sad about Lynn had time to          express her feelings which the whole group felt and could          sympathize with and I think it helped her to finally relive some          of the pain from her past and her mixed feelings for a friends          death.          I could identify with this and also her pain at being          betrayed.          I also discussed the start of my step 1 and I feel quite          positive about it although nervous. That\'s it. I am very tired so it is going to be short, it is a week abstinence today and I still have very bad cravings around food.Enjoyed group and how caring Robert approach the group.Had a very long walk and felt relief that my stomach worked.Feeling a bit more settle with the group.Got my book from last time I was in Promis and it brought some bad feelings up.Also, feeling very old and that I could have made the most out of my recovery, instead of relapsing.Fed up being me and what harm I do to myself.Enjoyed sharing with Nelly and how I will miss her!Good night.It has been a good day.          Two things came up for me: one was a discovery          (thanks to Juliette\'s Step I that I started          hiding my feelings as early as age 5; the          other my fear of going back home and having to          find friends in the meetings as most people          around Leonarda\'s school or even in my Fellowship          do not understand about addiction.          They might suffer from it, but have not          recognized it and           I have to include here Gerry too - he is still          trying to fight it on his own, which is going to          make our \"relationship\" rather questionable as          I can not tackle it any longer the way it was.          So, there are some genuine concern\'s for me to          face up to and on daily basis deal with, never          forgetting to tools the program has given me.)                    The morale of the group is getting better - it is          difficult to feel it is OK as we had  had so          many leaving and few new people coming and going          it unsettles me, and I must admit it is hard          work to open up to some new peer when I know I          wont be here much longer.          But, I must not forget that God works in the most          mysterious ways and patience is as good quality          as anything (if not the best).                    I am grateful to be here!Today I felt very tired and quite depressed, and everybody          seems to be so much further in their treatment in terms of          sharing how they feel and how to express themselves because I          don\'t really know how I feel.          The day passed very slowly and as most people had visitors I          felt quite alone.          John\'s talk in the evening was very encouraging as I have          heard so much about relapses and to see someone who was in          here not so long ago and to now seem so much better was very          helpful.

'I have mixed feelings about Peter coming back, felt the need to express my anger and sadness at the atmosphere in the home due to all the surrounding upset.Felt very uneasy to say it but felt better after I had, believe we are all entitled to a second chance, but we all have a responsibility to each other as far as manners and honesty which I feel he should be reminded of.Lesley\'s Peer Evaluation, highlighted the need for me to look at my own Process more closely and ask for help to start making changes.Wendy Step 1.  I felt very much that I have not let go of many friendship   in my life and that I need to look at why I have acted the way I did.Hugo\'s Peer Evaluation reminded me of the chaos and confusion in my life prior to PROMIS, the lack of confidence and direction.The atmosphere in the house is still very unsettled, some people seem to have no respect for others - this seems to be made worse by the fact that some of the people I know best will be leaving soon. I will be faced with getting to know more people again - this is all part of it I know, but still feel daunted by it.Dawn\'s leaving presentation left me feeling a bit low, realizing how much laughter she had brought into the house. Her positive attitude has given me some hope and some thoughts we had showed have given me a lot to think about.Hugo Step 1 - although little to identify with and it may have first been coincidental but it raised a lot of issues in my mind that I had not  for a long time.Hugo\'s using his friends to make it OK for him to carry on, reminded me of just how I justified my hyperactivity by telling myself I was helping others.His drink driving risks reminded me of just before Terry and I decided to split.We had a horrendous time from the time he got the actual to the day I actually left - I will write up on this in my feelings journal.For the first time today I got a sense of direction where I thought my Step 1 might be relevant - I had accepted I had reached rock bottom and desperately needed help, but still couldn\'t see clearly how or why I had started the decline.I now can look back and see it as me, not just think about it and not believe it was me.A whole mix of feelings  have surfaced for me surrounding areas I have not looked at and I feel I need some time with Amanda and Linda.I am disappointed I cannot go to the Gym/Mr Motivator, but I know it is meant for  my own good.I hope soon I will be able to take part in some more recreational group activities.Sheila\'s Peer Evaluation made me give serious thought to the fact of Sheila\'s listening to others, but not sharing is a trap I could so easily fall into.I do care so much for other people that I can lose sight of myself.  I must try and share each day and face the feelings it would be easier to push away.My time with Linda helped me look at my denial of love and affection for Matthew 0 I can see how I hold back in relationships for fear of getting hurt.I feel nervous and edgy today as I always find the PSYCHODRAMA very draining emotionally. Also I was quite expecting Robert to target me for questioning.My immediate reaction was panic at the mention of medication, but after speaking with Dave during our drive I had more or less decided to try it.I was very worried about seeing Dave and what his reaction would be, I felt in some way I had let him down.I have started to question how long I will have to stay here at PROMIS and I am concerned by this feeling as I know this is because I feel scared and want to run.  I still feel this is a real punishment, yet recognize I need to rest and ease up on myself.I felt really angry when the nurse confronted me about my visit and angrier still when I felt Linda was attacking me.But when I actually listened I realized she was confronting the angry anorexic side of me that is still fighting.I do want to be well, but I am terrified of gaining weight.Linda explanation of NALTREXIN and its possible side effect of helping me in recovery as far as easing away some of the pre-occupation can only be worth trying as I really feel powerless over my totally chaotic thoughts.Talking to some others, particularly Paul and Lesley has helped me see myself a little more clearly so I have definitely decided I want to start taking it as per advice/dosage prescribed by Robert.I can honesty say I am glad this week is over and hope that tomorrow will be a better day and that I must just try and get through each day.Felt sad to see what happened with Kostas and Elia but also felt powerless over the situation.Like the day was full and not hanging around with to many long breaks like having process group and enjoyed the lecture.Identified with Debs Step 1.Felt very unsettle with the whole situation about the week-end, wish that Tatu had spoken with Amanda.Would like to go away for the week-end.Felt relief to see Kostas and Elia back.Felt really happy to be at an AA meetings and to talk about my relapse in alcohol.Had chocolate cravings in the petrol station but was able to let go of it.Nice to be back in the house even it feels to crowded.',3,-5,0,1,5,1,2.01,0,4.01,0,0,0,2.01,0,0,6.02,0,4.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.02,0,0,0,5.02,0,0,0,9.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.01,2.01,33.12,0,6.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.22,0,0,11.04,0,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.03,26.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.02,Female52
'Didn\'t enjoy process group as I had to talk about confrontation and I fear talking in big groups and I don\'t feel I am entitled to take time as my paying for treatment hasn\'t been sort out yet and I fear it will be problems.Felt very happy with smaller group and could feel for Carol in her Step 1.Couldn\'t relax in meditation as I spoke with my mother and she told me that R Lefevre had said it was ok to take me out on Saturday after I had no from here.So, feel invaded that she can speak about me and I don\'t want to see her as she is so controlling.Felt angry in the loneliness group as I was preoccupied  about the conversation with my mother.Wish I got an omelet which I have asked to have once a week.Shared in meditation and felt better after talking a bit about myself.Felt less bloated today, but got angry to go on the scale and want to feel happier about my body image.Would like to go to AA tomorrow, but worried about he space.Going to bed early and a bit reoccpite.Lesson for today, and every day for me is:          \"Slow down - keep it in a day\"!                    Ana-Kate\'s Step 1 Part II made me realize the          identification which is: \"Always giving - but          never given\".          That was my feeling throughout my marriage.          Well, I definitely took a risk in a process          group and ma so very glad Louise is shaken          quite a bit out of her \"gloom and doom\".            She was an absolute gem today at the Nonington          Post-Office.                    It is my sincere hope Rania is OK and she  will          finally come to her senses and want to get          better.          The whole house is relieved and the atmosphere          is quiet and caring.          Ana-Kate and I have had a good talk about \"men\"          and \"sex\" this afternoon.          That was a follow up  to my sharing in the          gender group about my relationship with Gerry.          Once again: \"One day at a time\" and do not          project into fantasy.                    Had another chat with Annie - the positive          affirmations she gave me are very welcomed and          I am grateful for them and for being here.                    I am concerned quite a lot about Marylin - she          is not in a good space, and she seems scared.          I hope she will find strength to allow her          higher power to take care of her and her life.The day started with me getting ready to play          the victim role in my peer evaluation.          But got side tracked with the visit to the          psychiatrist.          We ended up talking (after he affirmed I was          not mentally ill) about the scientific          description (at the moment).          What love is, and its various stages.                    The good news has been of Marina saying it is          OK with her if I stay till the end of August          here.          She has no hardship looking after Leonarda.          Then I phoned my husband and left him a message          on his machine, regarding my stay here and if          he has anyway decided to take Leonarda away for          a holiday, instead of giving me the necessary          money to do the same (He has agreed in our          divorce documents to take Leonarda for 2 seven          day holiday\'s a year and to have her every          other week end)  he could perhaps be willing          to do so  and make it easier for her.                    I will probably end up being in a messy          financial situation for quite a , but it will           work out if I can have a good start for my          recovery.                    My peer evaluation was such an eye opener for          me and I think Annie was brilliant.          I could never see to what extent my dimisaz of          others is a reflection on me - to what extent I          dismiss my own pain, and have done for years,          and years.          I am so grateful for everybody\'s contribution          as from now I have a chance to start to change.                    Tatoo\'s feedback was also good: not to mix          stoicism for courage.           Again, it was an eye-opener.          It was so strange to hear the positive and the          encouraging - perhaps I do have a real chance          now.                    It was fun to be out in the garden and play          ball - but it is a real effort for me as it is          something I avoided most of my life.                    I managed to share with some peer\'s about my          mother in law\'s request reg. All jewelry and          silverware & crystal, when I asked for divorce.                    Basically I had to give it all back, and the          used and chipped stuff we had for everyday use,          whilst my husband completely refurbished his newflat, and bought new household items.          The latest   is this \"holiday\" - he has no          money to give me, but of course there is money          for him, and not just that, but he now has the          time as well.           As so happens it might work out for the best as          far as Leonarda is concerned.          Leaving me in financial mess, but it seems,          once again, I am getting what I need and not          what I want.Last night I kept waking up because I was so cold.Got up at 6.30 am.I can\'t really remember Robert\'s first group only that I asked if I was anorexic and he asked me what my score on the sheet was and I said 26 he just said there you go.Then there was Ivanka psychodrama.I was part of a uterus I know now why I am so sad and unhappy.I have to pay off Jonathan once and for all get my maintenance sorted out go to court for the shoplifting.Put him behind me and the children why can I not have a normal life too.Then Nicholas and Jenny came to see me.Only for 2 hours bought me 2 lots of flowers and gave me lots of post to go through it is all too much I don\'t understand what I have done with my money where has it gone.I feel so unhappy please help me.',3,-4,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.94,0,0,3.88,0,11.63,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.88,0,0,0,2.91,0,0,0,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.97,0,20.36,0,6.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.56,0,0,2.91,0,0,0,0,1.94,0,0,3.88,0,0,0,3.88,25.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.88,0,5.81,Female52
'I didn\'t have a very good nights sleep as I share with 2 people          I seem to wake up every time they go to the toilet and I had a          bad dream, about being in the war I used to dream about that a          lot a long time ago.          I did enjoy Robert\'s group today I feel a lot more relaxed and          comfortable in there I have had a good day I didn\'t have any          visitors which I didn\'t mind, Ryan rang me up he had been out with          his friends on the the motorbikes, he has had a good day, he          sounded happy.

I look for them.Don\'t want to go to the burning as I feel not part of it and not knowing the peers very well.Very poor day some no most of the peers are proud of what they have done in their lives or that is the impression they would like one to have.I am so ashamed of the way Jonathon and I have destroyed each other and two children on the way.I have cried enough now and no longer have any feelings left.I am old enough now to accept my faults and change my behavior which I can do at home.Self pity is what I am going through here and I want it to stop.I plan to go home at the week-end.I can make a fresh start.The peers are too young here for me they are like the children to me being around the same age as Julia and Alastair.I feel more of a mother figure to them than a patient.Bobs life story well he knows how to make people laugh only Louise Mel Julie can still laugh so I want to go while I still can before I am told to stop laughing.I want to go out to an AA meeting tonight.Asked Michael who says he is powerless over that.I would get far more out of an AA meeting that Anna-Kate reading from a book.I am too impatient for this program and I have not got the time to change, at 48 years old.Des collage I could identify with some of this but not much I think I was too drunk to know what was going on most of the time with Jonathon.OA meeting no good at all I wish I had gone to Dover.Because I will drink soon at this rate.Small Group was good to talk over, but didn\'t feel able to share my feelings as I feel very mixed.The Group with Ken gave me a lot to think around my future - I realize more than ever now that my career so far as been very much influenced by my addictions and how I want the emphasis to be different in recovery.I will need to look very closely at choice of job/career to ensure I don\'t walk straight back into trouble.It left me feeling more hopeful, knowing that others have fulfilled more than their expectations in recovery and that it is possible.I was glad to be able to join in with Mr Motivator and felt that I was actually listening to my body when I\'d had enough.After Alison Step 1 it made me think how important it is to take any major changes very seriously in recovery - as thoughts without using will be very different.I will be moving in with Lesley - GRACE - hope I can feel a little more settled as I have been feeling very unsettled since Margarita/changes.Amanda, could I please have some time today, to discuss VISIT Sunday - drive out with Dave.ECR Grant Check?Choice of Book?Next Helpers Group?My feelings at the moment.Step 1, part 2.',4,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,4.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.49,0,0,7.47,0,4.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.38,0,0,4.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.95,Female52
