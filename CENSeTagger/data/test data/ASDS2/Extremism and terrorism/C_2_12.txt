GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip &#8211; Islamic radicals from an al-Qaida-inspired group battled Hamas security in the Gaza Strip Friday in a shootout that killed five people. The fighting began when Hamas forces surrounded a mosque in the southern Gaza town of Rafah where about 100 members of Jund Ansar Allah, or the Soldiers of the Companions of God, were holed up, including some armed with suicide belts, according to residents of the area. The confrontation was triggered when the leader of the group defied Gaza's Hamas rulers by declaring in a Friday prayer sermon that the territory was an Islamic emirate. Jund Ansar Allah and a number of other small, shadowy radical groups seek to enforce an even stricter version of Islamic law in Gaza and have criticized Hamas for not doing so. They are also upset that the Hamas regime has honored a cease-fire with Israel for the past seven months. Hamas has said it seeks to set an example and does not impose its views on others. It also says its violent struggle is against Israel, not the Western world. The hard-line groups are perhaps the most serious opposition to Hamas since it seized control of Gaza and ousted its rivals in the Fatah movement in a five-day civil war in June 2007. The leader of Jund Ansar Allah, Abdel-Latif Moussa, warned Hamas forces against trying to enter the mosque compound. "If Hamas does that, it will be their end," he said. Shortly after, a gunbattle broke out between the militants inside the mosque and Hamas forces surrounding it. Gaza health officials said five people were killed and 50 wounded in the exchange of fire. A least one of the casualties was a senior Hamas security officer, officials said. Hamas security later raided the mosque. Jund Ansar Allah first came to public attention in June after it claimed responsibility for a failed attempt to attack Israel from Gaza on horseback. The group claims inspiration from al-Qaida, but no ties have been confirmed. In July, three Muslim extremists from the group holed themselves up in a building in southern Gaza, surrendering to Hamas police only after a lengthy standoff. It is unclear how many members Jund Ansar Allah or other similar extremist groups in Gaza have.
