we are most wonderful in our own stride. Even the weakest link is the strongest one. We just have to believe that God has made us in a way that we all form keys of a massive lock that needs to be adjusted, formed in proper combination and then run through for unlocking the mystery. So today take a chance, decide and go for it. you will win .... just believe that you will, and the beliefs will follow you. Just take a step to target, and the roads will move you... trust me to trust yourself and the God will trust you, and he like me , like you will hit the target and make it worth... we are what we are ... and we are all the best
