That is because alot of so called Muslims have an inherent hatred for Islam. I will tell you something from experience. If you are a drug dealer, a pimp, a rapist, a murderer and even if you committed incest with your mother.The so called Muslim community will still attempt to excuse your faults, argue in your favor and show you a small sense of belonging and support. Simply because you are a Muslim at the end of the day. However if you openly renounce Islam, then the entire community including the wino and the crackhead will be on your back whereby you would have to back up your bags and move to Alaska simply because committing apostasy is a major taboo in many Arabic, Turkish and South Asian cultures.This is because Islam has been reduced to nothing but an identity icon by these people.When you renounce Islam, you renounce your culture, tribe and nation Hence these so called scholars or rent-a-mullahs as i call them provide a solution to this problem.They can twist and lie about the Quran and Hadith, whereby they can deliver a fatwa justifying almost anything from smoking weed to committing credit card fraud.Hence these so called shakey Muslims will turn around and follow these scholars with utmost conviction because they can carry on committing sin yet still able to sleep at night without the guilt.
