I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 37, line 28, after 'letters', insert
'written orders for goods or services to be supplied to the business,'
The amendment extends the scope of the documents on which the details of persons using a business name must appear to include all written orders for goods or services to be supplied to the business. The amendment arose from a debate in Committee. I appreciate many of the points that were put forward by hon. Members. The amendment represents an improvement to the alternative system, and I hope that it will be welcomed by the hon. Member for Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis).</membercontribution></p>
In so far as one can support an improvement to a hopeless system, I support the amendment.
Amendment agreed to
