The weekend has arrived at last. After a long week of school, everyone looks forward to Friday - Sunday night. Especially this weekend. Today after all the classes are finished it is the start of Spring break for Oakland University. The weather has been so wonderful and it has made this week coming to an end something magnificent! whether you are going to a famous Spring break spot or you are staying in the comfort of your own home. It is going to be a time to catch up on some much needed sleep and even possibly some homework that needs to be caught up. I am going to enjoy my weekend with my mom and younger siblings, I am heading up to see them all tonight and will be there all weekend. It is going to be a much needed relaxation. Enjoy your weekend everyone! =)
