Well it's been a while since I promised to report back - due in no small part to the fact that it took me so long to get to my GP appointment. Don't ask. One appointment was accidentally cancelled by the surgery, one I forgot to go to because I had a tummy bug, another one co incided with another appointment and so it went on. But here I am - finally - with news!! I had, in between attempts to get to my GP, an appointment at the Pain Clinic with a Pain Nurse. I told her about my failed attempt to increase the dose of Pregabalin and she loaned me an NHS Tens Machine! To say that this simple little device is streets ahead of the all singing all dancing thing that I bought from the chemist would be a massive understatement. Even I can understand the instructions and use this one!
