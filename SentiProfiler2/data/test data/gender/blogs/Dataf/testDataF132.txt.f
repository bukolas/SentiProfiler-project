ike today, i want to punch someone real hard. right on the mouth.

i am such a debbie downer lately, everything puts me in a bad mood. everything pushes me over the edge.
boo.

like today for example, i called my pharmacy to refill my insulin. i have BARELY enough to eat things today. just barely. so i call in and they tell me i am out of refills. strange, because last month they said the same thing. they faxed my doctor and he sent in the refill. the box my insulin came in said i had TEN REFILLS. i am not sure how it went from ten to zero, but whatever. my diabetes doctor is not practicing anymore. last month around the 24th i received a letter saying he was no longer seeing patients, and that all future appointments were cancelled. so now i have to find a new doctor. fucking awesome. i doubt anyone knows a good diabetes doctor. maybe megan facer? 

anyway, i just wanted to whine some more on the internet so i hopefully don't freak out at trevor or start crying randomly.
