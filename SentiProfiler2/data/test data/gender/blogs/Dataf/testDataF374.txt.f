By 1905 the process of lowering the levels of Lake Chapala had begun, creating more fertile land for farming. However in 1912 a levee along the lake ruptured causing a severe water shortage for the people of Sahuayo and the surrounding area. This internal problem prevented the local people from fully participating in the Mexican Revolution which came about when Francisco I. Madero led an uprising against the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. The Revolution ended with the creation of the Mexican Constituation in 1917.
