For a while now, I've been relying on audio files for use as meditation timers. These files essentially consist of a recorded bell in the beginning, followed by a duration of silence, and another bell at the end. There are many of these available on the web, and are not bad. The problem is that you're limited to the duration of the files available, i.e., if you want to meditate for 45 minutes, then you need a 45-minute long audio file.Mildly frustrated by this, I spent some time this morning writing an on-line meditation timer. Simply set the duration, and click Start. You should hear a bell when the timer begins and ends.Here it is: Online Meditation Timer.Using Google App Engine and JQuery, it took me about 45 minutes to build this. That includes the time it took to prettify the site and type in this blog post. Gotta love simple, well-designed application frameworks! JavaScript turns out to be a great language for toying with graphics and visualization. This morning, I spent a few hours learning about the Mandelbrot set and trying to code up a working implementation. The link below is one of the fruits of my labor:Mandelbrot Set GeneratorMathematically, the Mandelbrot set is the set of points in the complex plane generated by iterating through the formula z = z^2 + c. For different initial values of c, the iteration can either produce a bounded sequence, or tend to infinity. Plotting the graph is a matter of placing a black dot for the values that generate a bounded sequenc
