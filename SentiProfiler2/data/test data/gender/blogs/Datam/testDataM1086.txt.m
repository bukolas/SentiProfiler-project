Ok so this is my very first shot at blogging, not sure why I'm doing this I just have a need to try some new things so here we go. I think seeing as this is called St. John's livin I will focus on goings on in my city mostly because I often feel guilty when I think there is nothing to do here.

A few of my friends have there hands in things that not everyone knows about so I will reference them often. Stephanie writes for a local paper she reviews plays and shows for them, also she writes a fashoin piece for them as well. Ian has his own photgraphy site and it is picking up steam www.ianvardy.com and Ashley is a dance teacher here in the city that has great connections in the local hip-hop scence which is also growing by pops and locks everyday.

Now I know the way my mind works so there is no way I will be able to stick to the idea that this is only going to be about local art and music scene, more often then not this will be my random mind grapes being stomped out into the blogosphere. With that being said I am going to Toronto tomorrow for a family wedding(allways interesting) and I'm also going to try and catch a hip hop class while there, so when I get back I'll chat about that and go from there.
