Over the past few years it seems like cosmetic companies come out with some new life-altering mascara every other week. I'm never the girl who's quick to run out and buy a new tube of mascara because I've found that plenty of them don't work at all or that they just don't give me the look I'm going for. Even though I was blessed with a head full of thick hair, my eye lashes, it seems weren't so lucky. They are thin and they're barely noticeable without mascara. They also have a natural curl which is good because I don't have to use an eye lash curler, but it's also bad since the curl causes my eye lashes to look short and stumpy.The Maybelline Define A Lash mascara has been on the market for a year or so and it's gotten great reviews in magazines and Adriana Lima endorses it.
