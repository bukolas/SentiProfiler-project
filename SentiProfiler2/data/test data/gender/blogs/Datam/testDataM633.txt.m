Oh ! I have been holdin up for really long time jus to make it better... ( i hope this comes good !!!). Peddy Dog, a sweet little boy nxt door... to be really honest i ws upset with him initially cos he was simply takin all the lime light... then realised hw stupid i was !!! he jus bowls u down with his frndship... i have never seen a guy as sophisticated as him... a matured looks,a dignified way of talkin, tht thundrous laughs and those chweetttt songs he sings(til date no one knows wht he sings...)the nights we use to sleep together (literally) , the nerve hitting arguements, the winning moments in cricket.... ,mannnn i jus dont have words to describe those lovely lovely time i had with him... his place is jus blessed with so many nice ppl and no suprises y he is the same... if at all i culd cum across a wishing well i wish this guys jus keeps smilinnnnn... 
takin life as it comes is his best mantra to happiness... jus down leave me buddy u r jus SPECIAL !!!
