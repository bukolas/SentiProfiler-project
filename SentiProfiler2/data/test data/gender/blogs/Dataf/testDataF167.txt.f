Have you ever watched the Animal Planet show Lemur Kingdom? Seen the children’s movie Madagascar? Or the show Zoboomafoo? Then you’ll know what a ring-tailed lemur is. Lemurs are so adoraale and enigmatic that they are a great way to bring wildlife conservation to children, and parents, and the greater world. Here's the  sweetest story about a 10-month old baby ring-tailed lemur who broke her femur and had to have surgery. She's recovering nicely. Peanut lives at the Summer Wind Farms Sanctuary in Michigan, and snagged her leg on a branch while bouncing through the treetops, as primates tend to do. It snapped.  The family-owned Sanctuary staff knew that without surgery, Peanut had little chance for a normal lemur life, since these primates spend the majority of their time in the treetops. So they brought Peanut to the Michigan Veterinary Specialists, a specialty and emergency care vet hospital which did the surgery and care at a reduced fee. These vets also occasionally do work for the Detroit Zoo, but specialize in cats and dogs. Poor little Peanut had to be separated from her mom during the surgery, which took an hour and a half.  During the operation, veterinary surgeon Dr. Jennifer Covey placed a steel plate and screws in Peanut’s femur. "Peanut's surgery was the first of its kind for me," explains Covey. "I certainly enjoy working with wildlife but I am not a specialist in them. I consulted with two zoo/exotics veterinarians to determine the best anesthesia protocol for Peanut as well as look for any metabolic disturbances that may have contributed to her breaking her leg. Lemurs can be prone to having soft bones if they aren't exposed to enough sunlight or are not fed a diet specific for primates. Based upon xrays and bloodwork we were able to determine that she didn't have soft bones (aka Rickets)." Before long, surgery was complete and Peanut started coming out of anesthesia. They had a comfy cage for her complete with a stuffed animal! She was on the path to recovery. It will take around 8 weeks for Peanut to get completely back to normal. Lemurs are an ancient group of primates that live only on the island of Madagascar off the west coast of Africa.  The group is quite variable, with the 99 known species ranging in size from the diminutive mouse lemur to the Indri. Because of rampant deforestation on Madagascar many lemurs have declined throughout their already limited range. Ring-tailed lemurs are endangered species. Though protected internationally, being endangered can mean they’re in greater demand for the illegal pet trade. The Sanctuary provides a refuge for animals retired from the movie industry or exotic pets whose owners have become unable to care for, including bears, tigers, monkeys and more. The family-owned Sanctuary provides food and refuge for over 200 animals so they can live their days in peace on their 140-acres.  Because of their anadromous natural history, wild salmon don’t stand a chance against gigantic hydroelectric dams placed smack dab across the rivers and creeks in which they have spawned in for millennia.
