I hope someday I’d be able to come back to CDO, for the nth time, and try the white water rafting adventure. Nevertheless, my first time was always memorable. It made me feel at home in CDO.  That time I was there on my first trip, I didn’t worry that I wasn’t able to tour the whole city. I knew in my heart that I would keep coming back to this place after that initial visit. And I would surely visit LimKetKai again…and explore more restaurants…and do the white water rafting…and shop more. The list is endless.
