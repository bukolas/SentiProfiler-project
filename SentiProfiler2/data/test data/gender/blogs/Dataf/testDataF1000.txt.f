The past months have been bitter sweet...I love my baby boy/girl. But some things are just stress in me so much to the point where I can’t take it no more. I can’t wait till my baby is here and camdon starts his new job soon. So many things are changing. But it’s for the better. I’ve been so stressed and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to handle it. And all this stress has nothing to do with the baby. I feel like I can’t do anything without someone saying something back to make me feel stupid. It’s to the point where I wanna leave and never come back. I’m sick of been made fun of and I’m sick of getting talked down to like I’m some kind of dog. Things need to change but i know they won’t. I guess I gotta suck it up and deal with it. I shouldn’t have to...
