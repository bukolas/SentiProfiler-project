Fortunately, scientists have developed an imaging system that analyses skin and predicts how it will age. It's called Visia Complexion Analysis, and not only can it predict how our skin will age, but the rate at which it will. It provides a snapshot of what damage has already occurred, and can thus provide a realistic assessment of our skin. The system looks at the major issues in skin aging - brown spots; pores; the bacteria underneath the skin that causes acne, redness, and uneven skin tone; as well as wrinkles, and UV damage. It's a great way to quantify the effects of our environment and our current skin care regime.
