Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah . To Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs [all] praise, and He is over all things competent.
It is He who created you, and among you is the disbeliever, and among you is the believer. And Allah , of what you do, is Seeing.
He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms; and to Him is the [final] destination.
He knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare. And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.
Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment.
