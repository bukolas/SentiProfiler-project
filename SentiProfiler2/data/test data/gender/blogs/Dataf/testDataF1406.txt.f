When I travel, I always try to find a Continental flight because I know that most of their flights are on-time and reliable.  I also find their seats to be a little roomier.  I recently flew American Airlines because it was more convenient, but was surprised at how CRAMPED the seats were!  In an airplane, when traveling with a lap child (child under 2 traveling on my lap for free), every inch of space counts -- big time!  We are very nearly always treated courtesly, although some of the flight attendants seem to be getting a little bit of an attitude, like "we're better and we know it".
