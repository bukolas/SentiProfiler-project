This was a second cruise for my husband and I and a first with the kids.  Our first cruise was on a different line and it pales compared to the Disney cruise experience.  Our kids are 4 and 6 and they had a great time.  As soon as we got in the car to come home they asked, "When are we going again?"We fed the stingrays in Nassau and that was a perfect excursion for young kids.  My youngest was scared to be in the water with them, but she loved watching them from the shore.
