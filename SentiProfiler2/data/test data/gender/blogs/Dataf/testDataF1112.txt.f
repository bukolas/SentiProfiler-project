Acne is the word every teen hates but faces this nightmare at one point or the other during her growing years. There are as many numbers of creams and lotions available as the number of teens with acne! New research suggests that a diet with foods containing low glycemic loads could help people suffering from acne to get rid of their acne.

Scientists from th RMIT university in Melbourne studied the effect of food on about forty three patients aged between 15 and 25 years. They were randomly assigned a normal diet and a low glycemic load diet for 12 weeks. The diet consisted of 25 percent energy from protein and 45 percent from low-glycemic-index carbohydrates.

It was found that people whose diet consisted of low-glycemic-index carbohydrates had a significant reduction in the total acne when compared to people on a normal diet.

What is Glycemic index?

The Glycemic Index (GI) relates to the way your body’s sugar levels respond to certain foods. Foods are given a rating from 0 -100 on the glycemic index with glucose in the highest position. High Glycemic Index foods (such as simple carbohydrates) will increase the body’s sugar levels rapidly whereas low glycemic index foods will increase the body’s sugar levels slowly according to HWF.

The new findings suggest that diets that contain low glycemic loads may not only improve insulin sensitivity and helps reduce weight but clears up acne as well.

So, if you want to get rid of acne and have a blemish free skin, foods that have high glycemic index like white bread, sugar, potatoes are a strict NO. However you can eat low-glycemic foods like whole grains, vegetables, fish and lean meat as these foods are kinder to your skin and say good bye to acne forever
