Although he is known for his high-rises, resorts and golf courses, Donald J. Trump helped create a little-known state park in northern Westchester County, donating the land for public use in 2006.

Like many things, the park is named after him. It is called the Donald J. Trump State Park. It also happens to be on a list of 58 parks and historic sites the state plans to close because of budget cuts.

The plan, released Feb. 19, coupled with the fact that the state would save only the park’s $2,500 annual budget by closing it, has infuriated Mr. Trump.

“If they’re going to close it, I’ll take the land back,” said Mr. Trump, who donated the 436 acres on which the park sits to the state after his attempts to develop the parcels grew costly and frustrating.

“It’s too bad the parks department is doing this to the people and the state,” he said. “I gave that land for the purposes of a park, and I always believed that once a park is there, it would always be a park.”

Officials with the state’s Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation say the state will not be returning Mr. Trump’s land.
