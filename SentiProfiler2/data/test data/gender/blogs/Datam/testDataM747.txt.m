Absolutely stunning digital rendering: [ Wow, that is really stunning work, and very creative. ] A quote from the author Staszek Marek: The most beautiful places that come to mind always have water, steep cliffs and tropics in common. Lush turquoise colors emphasizing positive vibes, something I've never seen. I wanted to achieve complete integration of future architecture with nature, complete with green parks, trees and gardens. What caught my eye and train of thought right away was his remarks about how big an influence the landscape is, in relationship to the architecture. Renderings like this . . . the creativity needs to be shared. There are a number of other entries here , be prepared to be amazed. Powered by ScribeFire . Great story in the NYTimes about Laura Spector who goes out into the woods alone and cuts down all the vine(s) she can pull out to make something great out of something very bad. [From the Laura Spector website .] Apparently she targets Bitttersweet or Asiatic vine Celastrus orbiculata which has run amok in her part of the "woods". Her specialty, apparently a little of everything-sconces, mirrors, arches, furniture, etc. Good for her! From the story: “I go out into the woods alone, everywhere,” she said. “And I go deep, a mile or two in from roads. The hardest part is schlepping the stuff out alone. I have letters of permission from places like the Aspetuck Land Trust and Aquarion, the water company. They’re happy to lead me to the worst infestations, as long as I indemnify them in case I fall.” Here's another great piece from Laura's website ; which I am linking you to, the NYTimes does not. [ One of Laura's benches , I love that Koa wood slab.] Great stuff, really great imagination. In her own words: My work is unique in that it is influenced by the rich and decorative18th Century British Romantic tradition. British rustic is unique from its more familiar American cousin, in that its graceful lines follow nature’s whimsy yet suggest the complexity of wrought ironwork. Finally this piece of railing: [Very nice, keep up the good work Laura. ] Powered by ScribeFire . I noticed that folks are still stopping by looking for info on Pergola's and such. Be advised that I have indeed been at this new site for quite awhile. Still discussing pergola's renderings, landscape construction, drawings, waterfeatures, ponds, landscape construction, etc. Even though I enjoyed my time here and appreciated the recognition of the Blogger staff I moved over to Wordpress .com. It was not an easy decision because I had to hand export over 250 post, and find a way to move comments also. It was the opportunity to have several pages to add additional info . . . which also allowed me to clean up the front page of my Blog. I don't know if I'm a minimalist at heart, but my inner designer likes clean and simple. So here I am gone . . . to Wordpress. Here again, is the new site . If you were kind enough to set up a link to this page from your Blog or page I would appreciate it if you would change that to my new Blog site over at Wordpress. I appreciate the fact the you thought enough of what I am doing to link to my page and I hope that will continue over at my new site. Again, thanks a lot in advance. I look forward to your readership, comments, and feedback. Landscape Design, and Design is important to our lives, and good design makes our life more enjoyable, more pleasant, and more civilized. I will continue to write about what I see, hear, learn, and ponder about as I continue my life's work. My friends . . . . have all chimed in, one way or another, and have decided they like the Wordpress look better. So I will respect their opinions and move. The only real question left for me is do I stay at Wordpress.com or do I move entirely over to another type of site. As in a paying site. Where I can have the blog hosted, and at the same time move the WCI website to also. There are (for me) plus'es and minus'es to both sides of this equation. All of this is going to have to wait until I get back from the Mgmt. Clinic in Louisville, KY. this coming week. I trip I am looking forward to-this is a very good conference, lots of high energy. So for now dear readers keep catching me over at the other site where I am posting like mad, like mad I tell you . . . yes actually mad. I wonder . . . how do you spell plus'es and minus'es? Well I have almost everything moved over to the Wordpress site . I am almost certain I am moving over there. The swag, chiclets(sp?), and buttons are not over there and I am not sure how that is going to work out. I really do not want to add anymore to the sidebar. If needed I will add those to another page. I have added everyone's link in the link page and think it looks good, and those links look easy to find. The page loads faster over there, and I like the cleaner look-hey! I'm a Designer! I Design, I like clean simple lines. Just look at my work. Now I know graphic design is entirely different than Landscape Design, but aesthetics are aesthetics . . . aren't they? Take a look , but I am pretty sure this is a done deal, unless a flood of folks say different. The biggest reason not to leave is that Google loves me, it really loves me. I hope it happens at the Wordpress site. We shall see. I have moved my Blog to a Word Press site. To see, just how it would look in a different type of setting. To streamline, to pull back on sidebar stuff. So I am looking for some feedback, via e-mail or comment. Which style of blog seems to fit what I am trying to do?
