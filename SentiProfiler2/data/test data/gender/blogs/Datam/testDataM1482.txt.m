Nonprofit organizations—and their staff/boards—which are part of the institutional Catholic Church should clearly support the teachings of the Church, just as employees/board members of any nonprofit have to be supportive of the mission of the nonprofit they serve. This story from the Washington Post reports on the issue. An excerpt. “Shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, Catholic Charities of Washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “That language was added March 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman Erik Salmi. He said the move did not reflect a policy change because employees have been told during training that the organization is Catholic in more than name. “Catholic Charities, one of the region's largest nonprofit organizations, has been trying to develop a way to continue its multimillion-dollar social service partnerships with the District while not recognizing the city's same-sex marriage law, which the D.C. Council approved in December. Employees were told this month that the agency was changing its health-care coverage to avoid offering benefits to its workers' same-sex partners. “Salmi said the addition of the clause to the hiring letter was not a result of the new law but rather reflected a longer-term concern that employees adhere to the organization's Catholic philosophy. “Salmi said the new language "is more of an expectation than a condition. It's letting people know this is the culture." Asked if that meant employees could speak or act against the church without being fired, Salmi said: "We can't speculate on the hypothetical. It's handled on a case-by-case basis." “A former vice president of the organization's human resources department, however, said the new language appeared to be a change. "Putting it in a letter and requiring a signature, that's a condition of employment. There's no way to dance around that," said Wayne Swann, who served 3 1/2 years on Catholic Charities' board of directors and an additional four years as its vice president. “Shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, Catholic Charities of Washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not "violate the principles or tenets" of the church. “That language was added March 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman Erik Salmi.

That being said, this example reported by the Washington Post , might not be appropriate, but until all of the circumstances are reported it can’t be determined. An excerpt. “Several Republican senators are questioning expenses at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a national nonprofit organization that receives millions of dollars in federal funding. “Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.) and John Cornyn (Tex.) asked in a letter to the group, released Friday, whether money is being spent on executive pay, travel and lobbying rather than on programs for needy children. “The umbrella organization, which receives nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the federal government, stands to gain hundreds of millions of dollars more from a bill pending in the Senate. The organization posted a loss of more than $13 million, according to its 2008 tax return, the most recent one available. "We find it hard to reconcile this loss given the amount spent on executive salaries, perks and lobbying expenses," the letter said. "We are especially concerned because it is our understanding that some independent clubs have closed or are on the cusp of closing because of a lack of funding." “Roxanne Spillett, president and chief executive of the tax-exempt organization, based in Atlanta, earned nearly $1 million in compensation in 2008. That includes a base salary of nearly $361,000, a $150,000 incentive and nearly $478,000 in benefits, expenses and contributions to a deferred retirement plan, a spokesman for the organization said in a written statement Friday. “Leaders of large nonprofits should earn competitive salaries, said Ken Berger, president and chief executive of Charity Navigator, a watchdog group. “The average compensation for executives at groups with more than $100 million dollars in annual revenue is $460,000, including deferred compensation, according to Charity Navigator.” A marvelous book I’ve been reading, Giving Well, Doing Good: Readings for Thoughtful Philanthropists , has many excellent thoughts to ponder, and one comes in the discussion of the different levels within the reasons for giving; and the third level relates to the best reason. An excerpt. “The third level—which might be described as the most mature form of giving—is a way of participating in the life of others, or an expression of gratitude. Here the key element is the other, the recipient; not the self, the giver. The giver wishes to be, and becomes a genuine participant who shares in an achievement by facilitating it. This giving also has the reward of a beneficent return, although the benefits are primarily for others than oneself.” (p. 129) This is a wonderful story, from the Stanford Social Innovation Review , about one person's vision-- it all so often starts with just one person --and her nonprofit's work to help immigrants to America become productive. An excerpt. “In 2000, while working for a national refugee resettlement organization in New York City, Jane Leu decided that the federally funded system of matching immigrants to careers was a failure. “We didn’t have an incentive to focus on [the] quality” of the placements, she remembers of her six years of putting highly educated, English-speaking foreigners in low-skill jobs. “It was just about quantity.” “So with no funding, a borrowed laptop computer, and her kitchen table as a makeshift office, Leu started the nonprofit Upwardly Global, whose goal is to help highly skilled immigrants reclaim their careers in the United States. “The beginning was rocky. With no funds and no employees, Leu was limited to one-on-one sessions with job seekers, reaching out to foundations for grants, and making employers aware of a hidden talent pool: 1.3 million bilingual workers with degrees and professional experience in every possible white-collar profession. “Successes trickled in. By 2002, the organization received its first grant and hired its first paid employee. In 2003, Leu’s work was recognized by the Draper Richards Foundation when she became its first fellow, earning a $300,000 grant. “Today, Upwardly Global employs 29 people to serve some 600 job seekers a year. With offices in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, the organization also relies on its wide network of volunteers. Since 2006, it has helped place 400 people with 300 employers such as Google, Genentech, Wells Fargo, the Gap, Safeway, and the Fresh Air Fund. Although Upwardly Global remains a small nonprofit with an annual operating budget of less than $2 million, it is widely credited for highlighting decades of “brain waste,” says Jeanne Batalova, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. It is also the first organization that reintegrates professional immigrants into the American workforce.” Most people are not aware of the large role that art—and the nonprofit cultural organizations that support them—play in the local economy, as they have in Midtown and North Sacramento. A recent study in Boston, reported by the Boston Globe , reveals just how productive that role can be. An excerpt. “Each year, 30,000 people visit the Danforth Museum of Art. Hundreds of youths participate in its free school programs, thousands of all ages enroll in art classes, and still more view exhibitions. “With this kind of score card, the Danforth finds it easy to convince the community of its value as a cultural asset. “But an economic engine? “A newly released study suggests that the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural institutions generate nearly double their budgets in local spending annually, creating scores of jobs along the way. “For people who believe in the arts, they get it when we tell them art is good because we know it’s good,’’ said Danforth’s executive director, Katherine French. “But that’s preaching to the converted. When we go to funders or business leaders or town officials, we need to be able to point to an argument that isn’t a matter of opinion.’’ “So, the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural organizations — Amazing Things Arts Center, Framingham History Center, Framingham Public Library, Garden in the Woods, and Performing Arts Center of MetroWest — united for an economic impact study paid for by the Sudbury Foundation. It was no academic exercise. “All six organizations are in the midst of, or are gearing up for, fund-raising campaigns to improve their facilities and ultimately make Framingham a tourist destination. They say proof of the jobs and business they create cinches their argument for financial support — especially during tough economic times.” The nonprofit world has long played an essential part in the nation’s politics. One of its earliest chroniclers, Count Alexis De Tocqueville, who came to America in the early 1800’s and met with many of the founders, wrote one of the most perceptive books ever written about America. Here is but a small part of what he said about voluntary associations—nonprofits. “Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States. “I have since traveled through England, from which the Americans took some of their laws and many of their usages, and it appeared to me that there they were very far from making as constant and as skilled a use of association. “It often happens that the English execute very great things in isolation, whereas there is scarcely an undertaking so small that Americans do not unite for it. It is evident that the former consider association as a powerful means of action; but the latter seem to see in it the sole means they have of acting. “Thus the most democratic country on earth is found to be, above all, the one where men in our day have most perfected the art of pursuing the object of their common desires in common and have applied this new science to the most objects. Does this result from an accident or could it be that there in fact exists a necessary relation between associations and equality?” (Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America , 2000 translation by H. C. Mansfield and D. Winthrop. pp. 489-490) Today, the work nonprofits do in the political world continues, as this report from OMB Watch notes. An excerpt. “Redistricting reform efforts have emerged as a key issue that could significantly impact our democracy in 2010 and beyond. While it does not appear that there will be nationwide redistricting reform, efforts are moving forward in several states. Nonprofits have taken a lead role in advocating for a process that is independent, nonpartisan, and fair while also ensuring that their constituencies' interests are represented. “Americans for Redistricting Reform (ARR) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that bills itself as "committed to raising public awareness of redistricting abuses and promoting solutions that benefit voters and strengthen our democracy." Its website allows visitors to learn about redistricting reform efforts in jurisdictions across the country. The site also contains fact sheets, court cases, research studies, and state and federal legislation on redistricting reform efforts. “ARR was launched by the Campaign Legal Center and includes major nonprofit organizations as advisory committee members, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, the Committee for Economic Development, Common Cause, Fair Vote, the League of Women Voters, the Reform Institute, the Republican Main Street Partnership, and U.S. PIRG.” It has many names, evaluation-outcomes-mission fulfillment, but whatever label is used, the point is that programs that ask for the public’s money—whether directly from the public in donations or indirectly from the public through government grants—to do something worthwhile, should be held accountable to have actually accomplished what it is they claim to have done. VPP News has an excellent piece on this. An excerpt. “In my last column, “‘Social Outcomes’: Missing the Forest for the Trees?,” I wrote about my deep, nagging fear that many efforts to assess outcomes are woefully off track. I pointed to several wonderful beams of shining light in the field, from Youth Villages to the Cleveland Clinic. But my dominant message was that many efforts in our sector are causing more harm than good. That column hit a nerve, triggering a volume and intensity of responses far greater than I had expected. “After struggling though literally 20 drafts, I wasn’t sure whether the piece was even coherent. Yet, it seemingly made some sense to a good number of thought leaders and practitioners I greatly respect—along with many others I don’t know who apparently care deeply about this issue as well. “Of course, not everyone agreed with my analysis. In fact, I got hard pushback on some points, and a few commentators wondered why it had taken me so long to own up to my own limitations in my approach over the years to the topic of outcomes. “The majority, however, agreed with the thesis that we’ve lost sight of the ends we’re trying to advance. In the wise words of David Hunter, Managing Partner of Hunter Consulting and former Director of Assessment for the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation: “It seems to me that the mess you describe indeed is enormous and very destructive—because few people involved in this work have thought deeply about m
naging towards outcomes and [they] have put the cart before the horse—focusing…on HOW to measure rather than on WHY measure…and WHAT to measure.” “Sins of Commission, Sins of Omission The feedback confirmed for me that nonprofit executives, staff, and boards; donors; and assessment experts are deeply frustrated with our sector’s work around outcomes. • I heard a lot of anger at funders who don’t walk (or fund) their talk. • I heard exasperation with nonprofits that are unwilling to embrace even basic methods of determining whether they’re doing what they say they do. • I heard disappointment that outcomes assessment has become an exercise focused on cold numbers—the equivalent of Robert McNamara’s simplistic and terribly misleading Vietnam body counts—rather than an effort to help nonprofit leaders achieve lasting impact for those they serve. “We must be intentional about surfacing these roiling frustrations that are rarely getting voiced. If we don’t, we’re going to continue to perpetrate sins of commission and omission that prevent us from making even the slightest dent in the failing status quo that defines education, healthcare, and social services in America.” One of the truly great examples of nonprofit work in education is the story of Catholic schools in America and as they enter a trying period in their illuminating history, having help charting the waters is appreciated. The Philanthropy Roundtable—itself a remarkable story of American philanthropy—has produced a marvelous resource, the 146 page publication Saving America’s Urban Catholic Schools: A Guide for Donors , which they have made available as a free pdf download.
