Here's a great post from Micah about sending on her 18 jeans! :) ~Jenn --------------- Tuesday, March 16, 2010 &nbsp; It is time to say good bye to a good friend. One that has supported me over the last few months. The one that got the WHOLE weight loss thing started for me. Yes, it is time for my beloved size 18's to move on to the next Fatty-Bo- Batty. I did take some parting pictures, with the help of my little assistant. (Meredith took some extra pictures, and I just love her little boots, so I had to share!) And now, as we say good bye, I am happy to say that I have lost 28 pounds! So, I am not too sad to see the jeans go. But, I think that is fitting to give them a nice send off. So, I decided to put together a little summary of my time with the jeans. So, Good Bye Jeans! And Good Luck Lori! I hope you have as much fun with them as I did! "Parting is such sweet sorrow..."

Dear fellow bloggerhood jeans, The time has come for me to say good bye to my fatty. It is hard to believe that is has been two months since I arrived, but fatty says its time, and well she might be CRAZY, but she doesn't lie! Since it is time for me to move on to my next adventure in fatty land, I thought I would take this time to reminisce. I arrived to a super excited fatty ! I got to go to a christmas party ( Fatty gets confused . LOL!) I survived a blizzard , and fatty loses a "butt load" of weight ! The long and short of it is: It all started at the fourth grade Christmas party, and it all ended at the PTO school carnival. Seems fitting that fatty would chose to wear me for the last time to the school carnival. There was a little change however. About 24 pounds worth of change that is. Apparently my fatty was serious about this whole weight loss thing. I am proud to say that she has stuck to her guns, and worked her butt off.... literally! She even has one pair of jeans living here that are sooo baggy, she could fit another butt in it with her. So, now come the pictures: I call this one...Wrinkle butt! See how many folds are in the fabric? This one is called side... yep, she is now down to a "mini muffin top" and last I call this Sexy middle... now notice how she wears her mom belly with pride! (please note that Fatty was REALLY going out on a limb by posting such close ups of her stretch marks) Now come the fun pictures.... see how good she looks in her tee-shirt and jeans, sans muffin! :) And the best picture of all, I have talked about how awesome my fatty's buns look, and so I made her take a picture in them. TA DA!!!! Boody-licious fatty! LOL!!! Well, thats my tale! Hope all you other jeans are doing awesome! Can't wait to move on to my new home! And, my fatty is ready for her next size...16!

Ok, recently? Today, I wanted to SOOOO bad! Some of you may remember a few weeks ago I decided to weigh in at the gym, just to see if my scale at home was off. And, BOY was it EVER! It had me well over 330. It was at that time that I waged a war with the ding dong scale. I swore I would never touch it again, if it was going to be so hateful. But, alas I could not stay away from it. I kept weighing in under 230 at home, and over that at the gym. Instead of being discouraged, I just took a step back, and started going with the scale at home. (I mean please, it had a better weight, who wants to deal with reality) It has been about 3 or 4 week since I got on the scale at the gym. But, then it has been about 3 weeks since I have been at the gym consistently. I have had frigid cold temps, and sick kids, and no time to go the gym. So, today when I moseyed on into the lovely gym to do my work out, I thought I would tackle the dumb scale today. I'm not scared! So, on my way out, I put my stuff down, hopped on the scale.... and.....I almost passed out AGAIN! Only this time, I am proud to announce, the scale happened to be at 216.5!!!!!!! I skipped the 220's! If I could have done cartwheels with out seriously hurting myself (because when you are 30 or over, you just should not do them anymore) I so would have! I am so excited!!!! As for the jeans (you know, the fabulous size 18's that MrsFatAss sent me from the bloggerhood ) that I like to strut around in, well they are still doing good! However, I can still wear them, and they are NOT falling off yet, which bums me out. I really would like to be in a smaller size once I send them on in a month. (can you believe that it has been a month already?) But, I cannot be to upset, 19.5 pounds in a month.... not to shabby! Be sure to check out Sue's blog here ! Fatty has a good Christmas My dearest comrades, (otherwise known as the bloggerhood jeans ) I come to you today, after about two weeks of family fun, food and craziness to tell you my fatty has lost 11 pounds. It is unheard of I know for a fatty to loose weight during the holiday season, but mine did! Ok, so lets back up a bit, and I will tell you the adventures that I have been on in the last two weeks. After our trip to the 4th grade Christmas party, fatty had a much needed vacation at home with her two adorable little non-fatty kids. They had Christmas cheer at Church, where fatty wore me to dinner. And her little Christian buns owned that sanctuary! And yes, she showed it to her friends. (Please note tho, I might say she "owned it" but she did not strut or flaunt, because that is not like MY fatty, she is way to proper for that.) The week leading up to Christmas consisted of shopping for the little non -fattys with her fabulous "other half of we" a trip to her favorite Mexican Restaurant, PMS (which, despite a few much needed, get out of my way or I will hurt you trips to Sonic Happy Hour for a large Cherry Coke, was very uneventful as far as the high caloric, high fructose corn syrup cravings are concerned) and a trip in a blizzard to Kansas City,Missouri with the whole fatty clan. That was fun! She wore me out to a fun dinner with her clan for Christmas dinner, in a blizzard in which she walked for three blocks to a restaurant that was supposed to be open but due to weather was not, and then back another two blocks to the place that she ended up eating (but only because it was the ONLY place crazy enough to be open). All was not lost though, it turned out to be a fun memory making trip, and the dinner was even good. She ate a spinach salad! And then walked back to the and WORKED OUT! I was so proud of my fatty! Then, the next week she wore me out for New Years Eve! Where again, she ate a spinach salad. She rocked the buns with her "other half of we" to hear her favorite local band of all time Bakerville. Boy, what a fun couple of weeks this fatty and I have had together. My friends, I hope that you all have had an equally good time sporting your fatty's buns during this holiday season. Here's to a fabulous 2010! Until next time my friends. Size 18 jeans (not 16) Fatty wears me to a Christmas Party. My fellow comrades, Today my Fatty-bo-batty (or FBB for short) wore me out of the house for the first time since I arrived, and it was about stinkin time! Where did my FBB take me you ask? Out for a Sonic Happy Hour drink? Out to eat? Out for ice cream? Out to shop? Nope.... she took me to a fourth grade Christmas party. At first I was appalled. Why would I, fabulous jeans, you know, the ones that make her buns look squeezable and AWESOME want to go to a fourth grade party? I mean come on! Fourth graders have not had two kids. They could care less that I have to squeeze some full figured 5'10" 220 something pound FBB into my outstanding material. But, oh well. I walked her fabulous buns into that class room, and followed every move she made. And, to top it all off, she did not even enjoy the buffet of high fructose corn syrup. (well, maybe just one little cookie). She did not drink a soda today, or eat wee little donuts. No sweet tea, chocolate candy, suckers, potato chips, dips or anything. I tell you what fellow bloggerhood jeans, my FBB kicked some major high fructose corn syrup butt today! I felt honored to make her buns look good! Well, it is time for her to take me off now....she needs to put on her sweat pants and big baggy shirt, because she can't breath! I will write more the next time she decides to take me out. And I will try to get her to take a picture of me....and her buns! :) Until then, good luck! With love, Bloggerhood size 16 jeans Our darling Micah got the size 16 jeans from Sue ! I'm super excited about her journey over the next two months, and I wish her a ton of luck in getting too skinny for the sixteens, baby! Here's her blog post about the package. :) ~Jenn ---------------------------- They are here!! Said jeans appeared in my mailbox on Monday, and it was so fun! I felt like a little kid seeing that package. I hurried inside and opened my package from Sue. She is so sweet! She put fun confetti in the package, and some candy canes (which if you saw the video, you know I don't have to feel bad for eating them). I took pictures...I just could not help myself. So, now we get down to business. Can she fit into the size 16 jeans, as hoped. --- SIDE NOTE--- I really wanted to take some pictures in the jeans out in Dewey so you all could see our cute little town, and so you could see all the fun thing that the jeans are getting to do... but it was REALLY cold when they got here, and I was not doing muffin top shots outside...so you get to see my bedroom instead! :) With promises to see fun places with me in the jeans! Ok, so here goes (and I really can not believe that I took these pictures, and I really can not believe that I am SHOWING them online! Ok...so there you go! They fit, but snug. I could wear them, but would really be comfortable after about day three when they are nice and stretched. But, I have incredible support here at home, and some really supportive friends, so FATTY BO BATTY BE GONE! Can't wait to see what happens after two months. Good luck to all the other Bloggerhood sisters!
