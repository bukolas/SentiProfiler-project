OMG! No! Some nurse at a hospital gave unethical advice to my grandfather who is diabetic to soak his feet in water and bleach to get rid of athletes feet cracked or dry feet. After a month of listening to this retarded nurse the bleach started soaking in the cracks of his feet and cause it to open more. Later he got an infection and now has half of a foot. Bleach is for cleaning and doing laundry only! Please tell me you haven't tried this yet!
