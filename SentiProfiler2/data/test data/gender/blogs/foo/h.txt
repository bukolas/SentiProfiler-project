Back in 2003, the popular rumor in Boston was that the Red Sox, White Sox, and Rangers were going to put together a three-team trade that would send Manny Ramirez to Texas, Nomar Garciaparra to Chicago, and Magglio Ordonez and Alex Rodriguez to Boston. Nobody knows for sure what would've happened had that trade gone through, but for a minute or two there I could see A-Rod and Ordonez in Sox uniforms. There have been other players whom I thought would end up on the Sox one way or another (Todd Helton is at the top of that list), but one guy I never saw on the Red Sox was Fred McGriff. Maybe it's because I was raised on the Lou Gorman-led Sox ("What would we do with Willie McGee?"), but the Sox already had Mo Vaughn at first. What would we have done with Fred McGriff? My grandfather grew up in a small town in South Dakota. His sisters were the switchboard operators for the town, and his father the postman and local semi-pro baseball team manager. He likes to tell the story of how, towards the end of one season, his father lured a star pitcher away from a rival team. And then, instead of pitching him in the big games that followed, kept him on the bench. When asked why he would do that, my grandfather laughs and says that his dad had the luxury of not using the star pitcher--as long as he wasn't pitching for the other team. And when the A-Rod and Ordonez trades fell through, what did the Yankees do? Did they say "Why do we need A-Rod when we already have Derek Jeter?" This is one of those little things that we with the Lou Gorman mindset never figure out: having Mo Vaughn at first and Fred McGriff, be it at DH or lounging on the bench, perhaps could've pushed the Sox closer to the pennant. Instead we defensively scoff at even considering the possibility.
“Greetings from the President of the United States.” That's what it said when my draft notice came in the mail, a couple of wars ago. But instead of thinking about how hard it would be to leave my family and friends for months, or years, I had another thought that ping-ponged around inside my head. What to do with my beloved and pampered 1965 Mustang? It was just too dear to my heart to part with, and I didn't dare leave it for my parents to drive—or worse yet, my little brother. It would just have to be pickled, and put up on blocks for the duration. That was a long time ago, and I wish I had done a better job of preserving that car, so I could drive it today. Yes, I miss that Mustang. There are lots of men and women serving in our armed forces around the globe. And I receive plenty of mail from them asking me how they should store their cars while they are overseas. The rules of vehicular cold storage are the same no matter why the car is left behind. But storage isn't always kind to vehicles. Corrosion and decay take their toll on engines, bodies and interiors. Time itself can ruin tires, and even a car stored inside a garage can attract some unwanted furry house guests. Here's how to protect and store your car, truck or motorcycle—the right way. Store or Sell? Unless there's something very special about a particular car, I don't suggest placing a car in storage for more than a year. Special-interest and collector cars, like that 1966 Vette or antique Hispano-Suiza, might tug on your heartstrings (and purse strings) enough to keep them in the family, but anything that qualifies as practical daily transportation, no matter how nice it is, should be sold. You can replace it with another car when you're in need of a vehicle again. The loss in value of a car that accrues in another year from its manufacture, even if the odometer doesn't see any more miles, is too high. One option for shorter-term situations is to simply keep the car on the road. Find some responsible adult who will drive the car every two or three weeks for an hour or more. This will keep the drivetrain lubricated and the battery charged. An engine that doesn't run regularly collects moisture and internal rust, especially on the portions of the cylinder walls not covered by the pistons, valves, camshafts and valve springs. Ditto for the brake discs, which are made from easy-to-rust cast iron. A car that's driven far enough to get completely warm and remain that way for an hour or more will drive off the moisture, coat any lubricated surfaces with oil again, and sweep the rust off the discs before they start to pit. And keep your insurance active: In some states, dropping your car insurance, even if you're not going to be driving, will make it nearly impossible or very expensive to get insurance again when you're ready. Check with your insurance agent; he may be able to reduce your coverage or transfer it to some less expensive option. At the very least, you'll want theft and vandalism coverage—just in case.
It has been a while since my last post. These long breaks are becoming more frequent and I'm not quite sure why. My life is probably no more hectic than some of yours, so for me to make excuses would be completely reckless. Many of you may have known that I have been in the media business for many years, and about 5 years ago I partnered with someone to open our own media sales organization. It was an exciting time for me and I'm glad that I did it. We had made significant progress over the years, but at the same time I felt it wasn't significant enough for me to continue in the partnership. I recently decided to hand the operations over to my partner and the other two companies that we had formed a relationship with. It was time for me to move on. I was hired four weeks ago by our local Fox Network affiliate, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, the largest independent broadcasting company in the country. It has been a crazy few weeks, but things are really starting to fall into place. I am excited for our future and will try and keep all of you posted on our progress. The kids are in school and once again we are pleased with the curriculum. Robin is doing extremely well in her classes to become a PA. I keep on telling myself that she'll only be in school for two more years thinking that it may calm me down a bit. It doesn't work. I'm sure that once we find our rhythm, things will fall into the proper place.
I have started going to School 3 days a week for about 3 hours now. I am now 17 years old. People say I have got better at speaking to people but I dont think so, I still get as nervous maybe even more. My Brother Adam now takes me out 3 times a week now for a couple of hours so im a lot busier than before. If youn want any advice or anything about Autism comment if you want. Once Someone called me a professional about autism but im not, I will still try to help if i can.
Ellen Riloff and I run an NLP reading group pretty much every semester. Last semester we covered "old school NLP." We independently came up with lists of what we consider some of the most important ideas (idea = paper) from pre-1990 (most are much earlier) and let students select which to present. There was a lot of overlap between Ellen's list and mine (not surprisingly). If people are interested, I can provide the whole list (just post a comment and I'll dig it up). The whole list of topics is posted as a comment. The topics that were actually selected are here. I hope the students have found this exercise useful. It gets you thinking about language in a way that papers from the 2000s typically do not. It brings up a bunch of issues that we no longer think about frequently. Like language. (Joking.) (Sort of.) One thing that's really stuck out for me is how much "old school" NLP comes across essentially as a study of representations. Perhaps this is a result of the fact that AI -- as a field -- was (and, to some degree, still is) enamored with knowledge representation problems. To be more concrete, let's look at a few examples. It's already been a while since I read these last (I had meant to write this post during the spring when things were fresh in my head), so please forgive me if I goof a few things up. I'll start with one I know well: Mann and Thompson's rhetorical structure theory paper from 1988. This is basically "the" RST paper. I think that when a many people think of RST, they think of it as a list of ways that sentences can be organized into hierarchies. Eg., this sentence provides background for that one, and together they argue in favor of yet a third. But this isn't really where RST begins. It begins by trying to understand the communicative role of text structure. That is, when I write, I am trying to communicate something. Everything that I write (if I'm writing "well") is toward that end. For instance, in this post, I'm trying to communicate that old school NLP views representation as the heart of the issue. This current paragraph is supporting that claim by providing a concrete example, which I am using to try to convince you of my claim. As a more detailed example, take the "Evidence" relation from RST. M+T have the following characterization of "Evidence." Herein, "N" is the nucleus of the relation, "S" is the satellite (think of these as sentences), "R" is the reader and "W" is the writer:
The rest of this post are random thoughts that occurred to me at NIPS. Maybe some of them will get other people's wheels turning? This was originally an email I sent to my students, but I figured I might as well post it for the world. But forgive the lack of capitalization :): persi diaconis' invited talk about reinforcing random walks... that is, you take a random walk, but every time you cross an edge, you increase the probability that you re-cross that edge (see coppersmith + diaconis, rolles + diaconis).... this relates to a post i had a while ago: nlpers.blogspot.com/2007/04/multinomial-on-graph.html ... i'm thinking that you could set up a reinforcing random walk on a graph to achieve this. the key problem is how to compute things -- basically want you want is to know for two nodes i,j in a graph and some n >= 0, whether there exists a walk from i to j that takes exactly n steps. seems like you could craft a clever data structure to answer this question, then set up a graph multinomial based on this, with reinforcement (the reinforcement basically looks like the additive counts you get from normal multinomials)... if you force n=1 and have a fully connected graph, you should recover a multinomial/dirichlet pair. also from persi's talk, persi and some guy sergei (sergey?) have a paper on variable length markov chains that might be interesting to look at, perhaps related to frank wood's sequence memoizer paper from icml last year. finally, also from persi's talk, steve mc_something from ohio has a paper on using common gamma distributions in different rows to set dependencies among markov chains... this is related to something i was thinking about a while ago where you want to set up transition matrices with stick-breaking processes, and to have a common, global, set of sticks that you draw from... looks like this steve mc_something guy has already done this (or something like it). not sure what made me think of this, but related to a talk we had here a few weeks ago about unit tests in scheme, where they basically randomly sample programs to "hope" to find bugs... what about setting this up as an RL problem where your reward is high if you're able to find a bug with a "simple" program... something like 0 if you don't find a bug, or 1/|P| if you find a bug with program P. (i think this came up when i was talking to percy -- liang, the other one -- about some semantics stuff he's been looking at.) afaik, no one in PL land has tried ANYTHING remotely like this... it's a little tricky because of the infinite but discrete state space (of programs), but something like an NN-backed Q-learning might do something reasonable :P. i also saw a very cool "survey of vision" talk by bill freeman... one of the big problems they talked about was that no one has a good p(image) prior model. the example given was that you usually have de-noising models like p(image)*p(noisy image|image) and you can weight p(image) by ^alpha... as alpha goes to zero, you should just get a copy of your noisy image... as alpha goes to infinity, you should end up getting a good image, maybe not the one you *want*, but an image nonetheless. this doesn't happen. one way you can see that this doesn't happen is in the following task. take two images and overlay them. now try to separate the two. you *clearly* need a good prior p(image) to do this, since you've lost half your information. i was thinking about what this would look like in language land. one option would be to take two sentences and randomly interleave their words, and try to separate them out. i actually think that we could solve this tasks pretty well. you could probably formulate it as a FST problem, backed by a big n-gram language model. alternatively, you could take two DOCUMENTS and randomly interleave their sentences, and try to separate them out. i think we would fail MISERABLY on this task, since it requires actually knowing what discourse structure looks like. a sentence n-gram model wouldn't work, i don't think. (although maybe it would? who knows.) anyway, i thought it was an interesting thought experiment. i'm trying to think if this is actually a real world problem... it reminds me a bit of a paper a year or so ago where they try to do something similar on IRC logs, where you try to track who is speaking when... you could also do something similar on movie transcripts. hierarchical topic models with latent hierarchies drawn from the coalescent, kind of like hdp, but not quite. (yeah yeah i know i'm like a parrot with the coalescent, but it's pretty freaking awesome :P.) That's it! Hope you all had a great holiday season, and enjoy your New Years (I know I'm going skiing. A lot. So there, Fernando! :)).
Is it the scripty names? The low budget headshots? The blue outlines for American Leaguers and red for National? What is it about this set that makes this grown man swoon? I'll tell you what. It's cheap. Super cheap, in fact. I may be blowing my cover here, but arm yourself with the right reference guides and you can buy the rare ones for practically nothin' from the rubes on eBay. It's a good-looking set, too. Clean lines, small Post logo, real team insignia and uniforms––none of that crap from the Eighties and Nineties, after Major League Baseball added a (TM) to everything and made it so the third-parties didn't want to pay the licensing fees. And this one's an old set, and a short one, too. Just 200 cards. And did I mention it's cheap? If you're looking for a fun, ground-floor set to get in on, make it a Post Cereal set from the 1960s. I chose 1962. It's got unexpected rarities (like Jerry Lynch), big names that are relatively easy to find, two versions of the Mantle and Maris cards, a host of errors, and the wonderful phenomenon of the hand-cut card. Ah yes, the joys of cutting your own cards! I remember a certain Will Clark card I cut off the back of a Drake's Cakes when I was 9 years old. It had more angles and jagged edges than a rectangle is supposed to have... Unless you had steady surgeon's hands or had a parent do the work, you got a ragged piece of cardboard. But that's the fun of it. Besides, who wanted to wait for a parent? I needed that Will Clark card in my grubby stack of cards now! And no matter where you find these early-Sixties Post cards, be it in the dime bin at a show or a ten-dollar lot on eBay, they are always a bit ragged. Sure, being born of cereal-box-grade cardboard didn't help (feels a bit flimsier than standard Topps baseball cards of the day), but it's the knowledge that kids in the Sixties were every bit as impatient to get at their cards as I was, twenty-five years later, that puts this set on a higher plane. So goodnight, you backs of cereal boxes, you hand-cut kings of nostalgia.
This is what I mean by small changes (to the input) begetting good example. A slightly transformed zero is still a zero. Of course, you have to be careful. If you rotate a six by 180 degrees, you get a nine. If you rotate a cat by 180 degrees, you get an unhappy cat. More seriously, if you're brave, you might start looking at a class of transformations called diffeomorphisms, which are fairly popular around here. These are nice because of their nice mathematical properties, but un-nice because they can be slightly too flexible for certain problems. Now, let's go over to NLP land. Do we ever futz with our inputs? Sure! In language modeling, we'll sometimes permute words or replace one word with another to get a negative example. Noah Smith futzed with his inputs in contrastive estimation to produce negative examples by swapping adjacent words, or deleting words. In fact, try as I might, I cannot think of a single case in NLP where we make small changes to an input to get another good input: we always do it to get a bad input! In a sense, this means that one thing that vision people have that we don't have is a notion of semantics preserving transformations. Sure, linguists (especially those from that C-guy) study transformations. And there's a vague sense that work in paraphrasing leads to transformations that maintain semantic equivalence. But the thing is that we really don't know any transformations that preserve semantics. Moreover, some transformations that seem benign (eg., passivization) actually are not: one of my favorite papers at NAACL this year by Greene and Resnik showed that syntactic structure affects sentiment (well, them, drawing on a lot of psycholinguistics work)! I don't have a significant point to this story other than it's kind of weird. I mentioned this to some people at ICML and got a reaction that replacing words with synonyms should be fine. I remember doing this in high school, when word processors first started coming with thesauri packed in. The result seemed to be that if I actually knew the word I was plugging in, life was fine... but if not, it was usually a bad replacement. So this seems like something of a mixed bag: depending on how liberal you are with defining "synonym" you might be okay do this, but you might also not be.
Arrived home from work this evening to a letter from the hospital. I've just had my monthly blood test and I immediately thought it might be a recall for another test because my numbers were high. Or low. But no. The letter reads: 'An appointment has been made for you to see Rheumatology Nurse All Grades or a member of the team'. And that's it. No explanation. No reason given. I'm not even asked if I'd like an appointment, or whether one can be arranged that's mutually convenient to me and 'Nurse All Grades' or the NAG as I'll now think of them / it. Am I alone in thinking this is a bit rude? I don't get summoned without explanation by my dentist, or my optician, or my vet (well, not my vet, the cats' vet, but you see what I mean). I feel like giving them a piece of my mind but I fear I've few enough pieces left for myself. I'll give them a call. I'm sure there's a good reason.
Okay, so this list is all food. But frankly, what else are you going to do here? Go to malls? :). There's definitely nice architecture to be seen; I would recommend the Mosque off of Arab street; of course you have to go to the Esplanade (the durian-looking building); etc. You can see a few photos from my last trip here. Now, I realize that most of the above list is not particularly friendly to my happy cow friends. Here's a list of restaurants that happy cow provides. There are quite a few vegetarian options, probably partially because of the large Muslim population here. There aren't as many vegan places, but certainly enough. For the vegan minded, there is a good blog about being vegan in Singapore (first post is about a recent local talk by Campbell, the author of The China Study, which I recommend everyone at least reads). I can't vouch for the quality of these places, but here's a short list drawn from Living Vegan: Mushroom hotpot at Ling Zhi Fried fake meat udon noodles (though frankly I'm not a big fan of fake meat) Green Pasture cafe; looks like you probably have to be a bit careful here in terms of what you order Yes Natural; seems like it has a bunch of good options Lotus Veg restaurant, seems to have a bunch of dim sum (see here, too) If you must, there's pizza And oh-my-gosh, there's actually veggie chicken rice, though it doesn't seem like it holds up to the same standards as real chicken rice (if it did, that would be impressive) Okay, you can find more for yourself if you go through their links :). Enjoy your time here! Quick update: Totally forgot about coffee. If you need your espresso kick, Highlander coffee (49 Kampong Bahru Road) comes the most recommended, but is a bit of a hike from the conference area. Of course, you could also try the local specialty: burnt crap with condensed milk (lots and lots of discussion especially on page two here).
I'm not sure how to help you catch up with events since my last post. It's not that there have been lots of "events" - just phone calls, visits, conversations, elation and despair. Just the usual really. It is just the up and down ... and the down and up. Jane's spoken on the phone with the psychiatrist who was covering last week - who seemed very good and took on board our feelings that it was important to get Sam out. Jane also bumped into the ward manager when delivering Sam his fix of tobacco and reinforced this message yet again. So they gave him leave - just around the grounds (ie the car park) with two members of staff escorting him. But at least it happened. And he's played football two days running in "the hard area" (or "cage" as we describe it.) We visited on Saturday and were able to walk around the grounds with Sam - and of course two staff. But he was fine. The more it works well the more they will see it is okay again and we can get back onto the upward spiral. But tomorrow we have a CPA meeting - a regular planning meeting. After making a fuss about asking for a copy of his last plan, the minutes of the last meeting and reports for the next meeting we finally got a copy of the last plan. They had some trouble tracking it down. It clearly wasn't a working document then was it ... ?
Forget the cards for a second. That's right, I want to trade this Harry Caray bobblehead to you. But here's what you have to do: You have to offer me a better trade than anyone else. My Keeper List is available to view (see link in sidebar at right), but don't let that hold you back. You want to trade me $80 in first class postage? How about a signed and numbered Dan McCarthy print? Or a few rare souvenir postcard folders? Here's what I know about this bobblehead: 1) It was made in 2002 by Bosley Bobbers 2) It's still in its original box 3) The box says it's a limited edition 4) It currently retails for $79.95 on eBay (link) 5) I don't know where I got it Here's what you should do if you want to add this bobblehead to your collection: email me with your trade idea. The best idea will get Harry and his enormous glasses, bobbling for all eternity.
If NP Bayes had its way on this problem (or at least if the standard models I'm familiar with had their way), they would memorize "talk" -> "talked" and "look" -> "looked" and so on because they're so familiar. Sure, it would still memorize the exceptions, but it would also memorize the really common "rule cases too... why? Because of course it could fall back to the parametric model, but these are so common that the standard models would really like to take advantage of the rich-get-richer phenomenon on things like DPs, thus saving themselves cost by memorizing a new "cluster" for each common word. (Okay, this is just my gut feeling about what such models would do, but I think it's at least defensible.) Yes, you could turn the DP "alpha" parameter down, but I guess I'm just not convinced this would do the right thing. Maybe I should just implement such a beast but, well, this is a blog post, not a *ACL paper :P. Take as an alternative example the language modeling stuff. Basically what it says is "if you have enough data to substantiate memorizing a 5 gram, you should probably memorize a 5 gram." But why? If you could get the same effect with a 2 or 3 gram, why waste the storage/time?! I guess you could argue "your prior is wrong," which is probably true for most of these models. In which case I guess the question is "what prior does what I want?" I don't have a problem with rich get richer -- in fact, I think it's good in this case. I also don't have a problem with a logarithmic growth rate in the number of exceptions (though I'd be curious how this holds up empirically -- in general, I'm a big fan of checking if your prior makes sense; for instance, Figure 3 (p16) of my supervised clustering paper). I just don't like the notion of memorizing when you don't have to.
I had a great idea a few years back: get baseball players and other celebrities to autograph my high school yearbook. How cool would it be to open your yearbook and have, amongst notes from your old friends, Fred McGriff's autograph? Or a 'Best Wishes' from Jonathan Franzen? I'm all about autographs in unexpected places. If I weren't so shy in real life I'd do it. Or at least have an autograph book, filled with neighbors and other people I've met. McGriff hit 34 home runs in the strike-shortened 1994 season. He was on pace for 48, had the season gone the full 162 games.
I've been lucky all my life to have doctors who pretty much let me do what I want. While I've had pharmacists question my inhaler use in the past, I have never had a doctor tell me to quit using it so much. Now I'm not saying my doctors aren't concerned, just that I've been fortunate to have doctors that understand that not all asthmatics fit into the "guidelines." Sure most asthmatics shouldn't need to use their rescue inhaler more often than once or twice in a two week period, but some asthmatics -- like me and perhaps you -- need it more often. I wrote about how I was a bronchodilatoraholic (well, I suppose, once you're a bronchodilatoraholic you always are) once or twice on my other blogs, and I have had people email me to tell me my asthma is out of control if I use it as much as I claim. When, in fact, my asthma is controlled. Thus, rescue inhaler frequency isn't always an indicator of asthma control.
Purge update. There's no turning back. Those of you who want to trade with me or want some of my cards, email me and we'll figure something out. Also, two nights ago I started listing cards on eBay. You can follow my auctions here. Last night I posted three lots of 1959 Topps Venezuelan, nine cards total. Almost immediately, they all sold at the "buy it now" price. If you're interested in Venezuelan cards, I have about 20 from 1960 and 16 from 1966, in various conditions, with Hall of Famers, stars of the day, rookies, Yankees, Dodgers, and commons. Also this weekend, I'll be posting a whole bunch of lots from the 1970s, as well as going through and putting together a 1986 Topps set, then giving away all the doubles. If you're in the Brookline/Boston area and have a hankering for 1986 Topps baseball cards, drop me a line before I drop them on Craigslist. The Keeper List update. As part of The Epiphany, I'm putting together a list of Keepers. What makes a card a Keeper? It's a card I have a favorable gut reaction to, if that makes any sense. For me the holy quintet of baseball cards is 1953 Topps Ed Mathews, 1954 Topps O'Brien Brothers, 1958 Topps Stan Musial All-Star, 1959 Topps Roy Campanella "Symbol of Courage" and 1972 Topps Roberto Clemente. These are cards I'd consider framing, cards that transcend their subjects, cards that I consider artwork. Of course there are others: 1978 Topps Eddie Murray, 1986 Donruss Jose Canseco, 1987 Topps Bo Jackson to name a few. This is a work in progress, but you can follow that progress by viewing the Keeper List here. If you'd like to trade with me, these are the cards I'm interested in obtaining. This weekend I'm going to start posting more about The Purge in earnest. But I'm serious, if you want to trade with me or you just plain want some of my cards, email me.
Arxiv is something of an underutilized resource in computer science. Indeed, many computer scientists seems not to even know it exists, despite it having been around for two decades now! On the other hand, it is immensely popular among (some branches of) mathematics and physics. This used to strike me as odd: arxiv is a computer service, why haven't computer scientists jumped on it. Indeed, I spent a solid day a few months ago putting all my (well almost all my) papers on arxiv. One can always point to "culture" for such things, but I suspect there are more rational reasons why it hasn't affected us as much as it has others. I ran in to arxiv first when I was in math land. The following is a cartoon view of how (some branches of) math research gets published: Authors write a paper Authors submit paper to a journal Authors simultaneously post paper on arxiv Journal publishes (or doesn't publish) paper We can contrast this with how life goes in CS land: Conference announces deadline One day before deadline, authors write a paper Conference publishes (or rejects) paper I think there are a few key differences that matter. Going up to the mathematician model, we can ask ourselves, why do they do #3? It's a way to get the results out without having to wait for a journal to come back with a go/no-go response. Basically in the mathematician model, arxiv is used for advertising while a journal is used for a stamp of approval (or correctness). So then why don't we do arxiv too? I think there are two reasons. First, we think that conference turn around is good enough -- we don't need anything faster. Second, it completely screws up our notions of blind review. If everyone simultaneously posted a paper on arxiv when submitting to a conference, we could no longer claim, at all, to be blind. (Please, I beg of you, do not start commenting about blind review versus non-blind review -- I hate this topic of conversation and it never goes anywhere!) Basically, we rely on our conferences to do both advertising and stamp of approval. Of course, the speed of conferences is mitigated by the fact that you sometimes have to go through two or three before your paper gets in, which can make it as slow, or slower than, journals. In a sense, I think that largely because of the blind thing, and partially because conferences tend to be faster than journals, the classic usage of arxiv is not really going to happen in CS. (There's one other potential use for arxiv, which I'll refer to as the tech-report effect. I've many times seen short papers posted on people's web pages either as tech-reports or as unpublished documents. I don't mean tutorial like things, like I have, but rather real semi-research papers. These are papers that contain a nugget of an idea, but for which the authors seem unwilling to go all the way to "make it work." One could imagine posting such things on arxiv. Unfortunately, I really dislike such papers. It's very much a "flag planting" move in my opinion, and it makes life difficult for people who follow. That is, if I have an idea that's in someone elses semi-research paper, do I need to cite them? Ideas are a dime a dozen: making it work is often the hard part. I don't think you should get to flag plant without going through the effort of making it work. But that's just me.) However, there is one prospect that arxiv could serve that I think would be quite valuable: literally, as an archive. Right now, ACL has the ACL anthology. UAI has its own repository. ICML has a rather sad state of affairs where, from what I can tell, papers from ICML #### are just on the ICML #### web page and if that happens to go down, oh well. All of these things could equally well be hosted on arxiv, which has strong government support to be sustained, is open access, blah blah blah. This brings me to a question for you all: how would you feel if all (or nearly all) ICML papers were to be published on arxiv? That is, if your paper is accepted, instead of uploading a camera-ready PDF to the ICML conference manager website, you instead uploaded to arxiv and then sent your arxiv DOI link to the ICML folks?
This post is a bit of a historical retrospective, because it's only been recently that these things have aligned themselves in my head. The all goes back to Jyrki Kivenen and Manfred Warmuth's paper on exponentiated gradient descent that dates back to STOC 1995. For those who haven't read this paper, or haven't read it recently, it's a great read (although it tends to repeat itself a lot). It's particularly interesting because they derive gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent (GD and EG) as a consequence of other assumptions. In particular, suppose we have an online learning problem, where at each time step we receive an example x, make a linear prediction (w'x) and then suffer a loss. The idea is that if we suffer no loss, then we leave w as is; if we do suffer a loss, then we want to balance two goals: Change w enough so that we wouldn't make this error again Don't change w too much The key question is how to define "too much." Suppose that we measure changes in w by looking at Euclidean distance between the updated w and the old w. If we work through the math for enforcing 1 while minimizing 2, we derive the gradient descent update rule that's been used for optimizing, eg., perceptrons for squared loss for ages. The magic is what happens if we use something other than Euclidean distance. If, instead, we assume that the ws are all positive, we can use an (unnormalized) KL divergence to measure differences between weight vectors. Doing this leads to multiplicative updates, or the exponentiated gradient algorithm. (Obvious (maybe?) open question: what happens if you replace the distance with some other divergence, say a Bregman, or alpha or phi-divergence?) This line of thinking leads naturally to Crammer et al.'s work on Online Passive Aggressive algorithms, from JMLR 2006. Here, the idea remains the same, but instead of simply ensuring that we make a correct classification, ala rule (1) above, we ensure that we make a correct classification with a margin of at least 1. They use Euclidean distance to measure the difference in weight vectors, and, for many cases, can get closed-form updates that look GD-like, but not exactly GD. (Aside: what happens if you use, eg., KL instead of Euclidean?) Two years later, Mark Dredze, Koby Crammer and Fernando Pereira presented Confidence-Weighted Linear Classification. The idea here is the same: don't change the weight vectors too much, but achieve good classification. The insight here is to represent weight vectors by distributions over weight vectors, and the goal is to change these distributions enough, but not too much. Here, we go back to KL, because KL makes more sense for distributions, and make a Gaussian assumption on the weight vector distribution. (This has close connections both to PAC-Bayes and, if I'm wearing my Bayesian hat, Kalman filtering when you make a Gaussian assumption on the posterior, even though it's not really Gaussian... it would be interesting to see how these similarities play out.) The cool thing here is that you effectively get variable learning rates on different parameters, where confident parameters get moved less. (In practice, one really awesome effect is that you tend to only need one pass over your training data to do a good job!) If you're interested in the Bayesian connection, you can get a very similar style algorithm if you do EP on a Bayesian classification algorithm (by Stern, Herbrich and Graepel), which is what Microsoft Bing uses for online ads. This finally bring us to NIPS this year, where Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza and Mark Dredze presented work on Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors. Here, they take Confidence Weighted classification and turn the constraints into pieces of the regularizer (somewhat akin to doing a Lagrangian trick). Doing so allows them to derive a representer theorem. But again, the intuition is exactly the same: don't change the classifier too much, but enough. All in all, this is a very interesting line of work. The reason I'm posting about it is because I think seeing the connections makes it easier to sort these different ideas into bins in my head, depending on what your loss is (squared versus hinge), what your classifier looks like (linear versus distribution over linear) and what your notion of "similar classifiers" is (Euclidean or KL). (Aside: Tong Zhang has a paper on regularized winnow methods, which fits in here somewhere, but not quite as cleanly.)
This afternoon I sat by the side of the road, waiting for the crosstown bus. I sat there for what seemed like forever, but was probably no longer than 20 minutes. I finally got so impatient that I crouched next to the bus stop sign, counting the seconds between a car appearing around the bend and it passing me. I also got to thinking... If I can't hardly wait 20 minutes for the bus, what's it like to wait six years from the time you retire to when you first become eligible for the Hall of Fame? What's it like, the anticipation? Part of me thinks 'waiting for the bus' is a good analogy here. Sometimes it's on time, sometimes you have to wait a little longer, and sometimes it never comes at all. A lot can happen in six years. Whole lives can change (but there's the Hall of Fame ballot announcement date, circled with permanent marker on the calendar in the back of your mind). For some guys, it's a given that the Hall will call (hey, that rhymes). Guys like Rickey Henderson, Greg Maddux, Craig Biggio--these guys don't have to worry. But is too much emphasis placed on being an inductee in the first year of eligibility? It took Duke Snider eleven years of voting to make the Hall of Fame (first appeared in 1970, inducted in 1980), Joe Cronin ten years (1947-1956), Don Drysdale ten years (1975-1984), and Bob Lemon 13 years (1964-1976). And those players are just four examples. There are plenty of others. It's guys like Jim Rice, David Concepcion, and Dale Murphy who get their hopes up, only to have them crushed year after year. And I guess I'll probably have to add Fred McGriff's name to that list in a few years. McGriff becomes eligible next year (for 2010 enshrinement), and while I'll be pulling for him, these days 493 career home runs don't seem to be enough to hang your legacy on.
We had hoped we might have been able to go for a walk around the grounds with Sam and a couple of staff when we visited today. Jane had rung to try to arrange it yesterday. But just before we were due to set off we received a phone call from Sam's named nurse, J. As well as smashing his guitar on Thursday evening, on Friday evening Sam had slapped J's face and later thumped him in the stomach. He was unable to explain why he had acted in this way. He denied he had done it and claimed the mark left on J's face was a birth mark. So of course his leave has been cancelled again. It is lucky in a way - though not for him - that it was J. J is very experienced and genuinely wanted to try to understand why Sam had acted in this way so reacted to it all very calmly and properly. The phone conversation though was very positive and both J and Jane said how useful they had found it. Sam was quiet but fine when we visited. A bit distant perhaps. Friendly to start with but became more distant as we chatted. He mentioned slapping J but could not explain why - other than he was angry at being detained. He seems angry too at seeing us get older. Perhaps it reminds him of having lost his youth in hospital. We have noticed too how he is aging more quickly - lines around his eyes and so on. No doubt effects of the medication. We worry the internal effects may well be the same.
Sara and I got to the gym tonight for a nice workout at the BSC Westborough. I started off with a 2 mile run though I had intentions of running a bit further. I just didn't feel all that great and count myself as lucky to have finished the 2 mile run in 14:10 for an average pace of 7:04/mile with 280 calories burned. After running I lifted biceps and triceps. I did standing hammer curls, cable curls, cable rope pulldowns, cable v bar pulldowns and cable machine curls. In waiting for Sara I ended up jumping on the bike machine and doing a 4.02 mile ride in 15:37.
It was about 10 years ago when carpal-tunnel first hit me. Every time I put my hand on my mouse, I'd get spasms of pain in my various parts of my arm. I tried special ergonomic mice and trackballs, but they didn't help. I tried speech recognition software, but it was a joke. Whether I could continue with my profession was becoming an issue. I even tried moving the mouse with my feet. Nose mousing was next. Then I discovered the Wacom tablet. For a long time, it was a godsend. The pain almost went away -- but not forever. A couple years ago, the pain started returning. The Wacom bought me some time, but it was not a permanent solution -- at least not by itself. Somebody recommended I read Pain Free at Your PC by Pete Egoscue. I'm glad he did. This book has saved my career (even though I'm not exactly following its advice). Its main point is that carpal tunnel originates with the spine -- that is, a spine in poor posture. When standing straight, the spine is in an "S" curve. Think of the neck, shoulder blades, lumbar and tail bone. When standing up straight, they are shaped like an "S". The spine is a balanced spring with the skull balanced on top. Your arms are hanging straight down and your skeletal/joint/muscle system is at peace. When sitting with poor posture, however, the spine is in a "C" shape. The lumbar curve is gone or reduced. The spine is a cantilevered, stressed support for the head and arms. The spine, in turn, is supported by the small muscles of the back. But those muscles are meant to steer the spine and body, not support its weight. Now, what's the connection between the spine and wrist pain? Think of the song: "The head bone is connected to the neck bone..." In this case, the spine bone is connected to the shoulder bone, and the shoulder bone is connected to the arm bone. The bones and the muscles and the ligaments and tendons are connected. It's a system. When the spine is in a "C" shape, the body's structural support is out of whack. As Egoscue puts it (I can't quote directly, I lost the book), a poor posture will gradually make your bones and muscles disintegrate turning your body into a pain-wracked, arthritic, crumbled ruined husk of its former self. Of course, proper posture is the solution. But how do you make that happen? It's not easy, especially for slouch-meisters like me. Egoscu's solution: yoga. As I understand it, yoga will strengthen muscles that usually don't get enough exercise. His book has a number of yoga exercises that are specifically designed for carpal-tunnel suffers. He has exercises for light, medium and heavy PC users. His approach makes sense to me. Unfortunately, the story did not end there for me. I tried to do the exercises, but they hurt like hell. And they took a long time. And I don't have the discipline. I failed.
Also remember the weakness to alot of computers is the actual Web Browser itself as well. Every Browser (and System) has its weakness. Just Google "PWN2OWN" the Mac was hacked in under 10 seconds this year, and this was a fully patched system. Every System has its weaknesses. As long as you're web smart about the links and sites you visit, you'll be fine. Also if you have a good memory, use different passwords. I use about 20 different passwords (Yes, I'm that paranoid :D) and each one of them has a different category e.g. Personal, Work, Bank, Mail, WebServers, etc... the daft thing alot of people do is use the same password for everything, e.g. you might sign up to a website and use the same password you do as your PayPal and E-Mail accounts. BAD IDEA!!!
Staying in a relationship when it is time to call it quits can lead to serious consequences for your health or well-being. Stress, tension and anxiety can take their toll and it simply isn't worth it. If you are suffering in a bad relationship and there's no sign of improvement, then it is best to end it and move on. It is better to be alone and happy then to stay with someone who makes you unhappy. You owe it to yourself to find true happiness with someone who loves, cares for, and respects you.
That’s Bansko, a bit rough around the edges but friendly and accommodating at its center. And for those who want to stretch their wallet in luxury this is the place. Set in the southern Bulgarian mountains close to the border with Greece, Bankso has always been associated with cheap prices, but now it’s becoming known for world class skiing as well. A crash in real estate speculation in 2008 has helped keep the prices down, but the residents of this former communist state kept themselves busy upgrading the town and ski area with the latest equipment and amenities. The speculation years left their scars in the form of half built hotels and high rise condominiums, but the old section of town was preserved reasonably well. There is still a rare lived in feeling to the old-town which makes a charming contrast to ski area and new construction just across
Hi everyone.  As you no doubt noticed, we pretty much shut down over the Christmas holidays.  I did this on purpose as I really wanted (needed) to focus on having an incredible Christmas and some complete down time.  In addition, I wanted to focus on launching my new book!  I'm pleased to say that I was successful on all fronts.
I spent the next eight years reading everything I could about tribal people who lived in the deserts, mountains and jungles of the world. In 2005, after living in Argentina for five months, I was finally granted the opportunity to realise my dream by visiting a remote tribe in the Javari Basin of the Amazon Rainforest on the border between Peru in Brazil. After that I was hooked. In 2006 I visited nomads living in the remotest part of the Moroccan Atlas mountains. In 2007 I spent a month traveling independently in West Papua on the island of New Guinea then a week on Siberut, one of Indonesia's Mentawai Islands. My aim has been, wherever possible, to learn some lingua franca before I visit tribal groups so that I can visit them without a guide and can communicate directly with them myself. My style of travel on all of these trips could best be described as neither sight-seeing, backpacking or exploring but more just trying to understand different ways of thinking and viewing life and the world.
We need to stress good health at a young age.We need mandatory gym and phys ed through high school.We need children to bug there parents about not smoking in tight areas with them present,autos for one. We need insurance company's to allow for costs reflective of health.Less cost for healthier people.More help for those who need it because of things beyond there control.IE:Cancer,having never smoked,over weight because of a medical problem,again medical,not lazy.And stop free medical to illegals
I’m in Kosovo now! What do I do? Don’t panic, go to your nearest cafe (they’re everywhere) and have one of the best inexpensive machiatos anywhere in the world. Feeling better? Good. Now, all you need to do is plan your exit from Kosovo by either flight or overland through another country (there are no flights direct from Pristina to Belgrade but you can fly from Skopje, Macedonia). If you want to get back into Serbia overland your best bet is to cross into Macedonia and then into Serbia by bus, or a nine hour train ride form Skopje.
Whenever you go to the Our Cancer group, you'll always see most recent blog posts first. Just to the right of the latest blog post, you'll see two tabs; one for blogs and the other for discussions. If you want to see recent discussions, just click that tab and it will switch to the discussion. There's also a "view all" button for both blog entries and discussions so you can browse recent submissions from other community members.
The rain eased off and a glowing purple and red sun began to set, apologising for all the stress and danger we had been through that day. The beach was empty, peaceful and calm.
he best way to protect yourself from computer viruses and remote attackers is to dedicate a computer to doing it for you, kinda like a network gateway for your home network. If you're the type of person that always worries about viruses and sensitive information being stolen but don't know that much about computer networks, I'd recommend using untangle (http://www.untangle.com/home-content-fil. ), very easy to install and can quickly protect you home network in minutes, there's also parental filtering with predefined filters if you're worried about what sites your kids go on. In the package you get a Firewall, Virus Protection, Spyware Blocking, Phish Blocking, Spam Blocking, Protocol Control (Blocks protocols for online games, IM & P2P), Reports and Monitoring, all of this has automatic updating as well, plus its free :D.
I was headed into an inferno, at least, that was what the news story on the Internet led me to believe. It was old news really, I remembered first hearing about the fires burning across the Peloponnesian Peninsula when I was in Rhodes a few weeks before. I had never even considered changing my plans due to the fires, though. After all, I had lived for many years in California where forest fires were commonplace and I was only going to get one chance of ‘seeing’ six of the Seven Wonders of the World before it was time to go home.
During our meetings, it became clear to me how entirely personal each volunteer’s experience in country can be. We read one submission on the issue of ‘hello.’ This word, one of the most common on the planet, is routinely shouted at volunteers country wide. The article itself was written by a guy in a village who described the practice as overwhelming, often shouted by grown men being intentionally obnoxious.
No this is not True. But what is, is we have a stronger will power. Women have a Tendance to cheat on their diets. I went on a slim fast diet and lost 50lb in 30 days, so it dose work and I kept it off for more then 6 years. And so can everyone.
Difficult question... first, no macs aren't the answer and im not a mac hater im actually using one right now. You need to understand no computer that's connected to the internet can EVER be completely safe from viruses, Trojans and worms but precautions like virus scanners or internet security suites help. I recommend Mcafee and Norton because there updated quicker and because they have extra precautions others don't have. You can actually get mcafee for free sign in or sign up for aol and go to downloads section they offer an aol enhanced version under the security tab.
The crew disembarked us - hippies, German girls and big bags soaked on a remote rocky pier. Eventually a few motorcycles arrived and propelled us through the rainy jungle, dropping us off on the beach at the other end of the only road on the island.
Visit Serbia first. Fly into Belgrade, explore the country and then move on to Kosovo where you can obtain an entry visa at the Kosovo border checkpoint. Just remember you won’t be able to return to Serbia the same way if you get a Kosovo entry stamp, so plan your flights carefully (e.g. fly into Belgrade and out from Pristina). Or you can ask the Kosovar boarder control not to stamp your passport…not technically legal but it works for a lot of people (including me just last week).
I handed my passport to the Serbian police officer. He scowled, not from the encroaching cold, but because I was American and had Kosovo visa stamps. Thankfully, I also had a Serbian entry stamp so there was nothing he could do but waive me through. A few kilometers down a windy country road I reached the Kosovar border checkpoint.
During discussion of the article, however, it turned out each person in the room had experienced this phenomenon differently. My experience, in the city, was one of children, who seem to be just trying to see if the word they learned in school actually works, and then, lost in their excitement, repeat it ad infinitum. Young women described it coming from teenage boys only once they’d past them, as a weird sexual cut, and the grey haired women amongst us (age being highly respected here) described largely no problems at all.
With Our Cancer, any of you can begin your own discussion or share your own story. For example, if you wanted to start a conversation about who's thinking of getting involved in a particular clinical trial, you could go to Our Cancer's discussion board, click the "start a discussion" button and begin a conversation about it. For example, Liz L. has already started a discussion about chemo fog. Or if you wanted to share a story of your experience at your first chemo session, you could create your own blog post by clicking the "add a post" button - and maybe even write other blog posts as you complete your treatment. That's why it's called Our Cancer -- it's a place where all of us can share our experiences in Cancer World in a collaborative way.
Having lived in Australia for five years, I am in favor of some form of universal health care system. I am one of the many un-insured with in this country and without having VA benefits, I would be forced to go without health care or face great debt. Being unemployed and disabled makes it even more difficult.
The pain and the side effects will be there like uninvited guests.  They're hard to ignore, but I will do my best to do just that. So let's just remember all of our friends and loved ones who have had to deal with this dreadful disease, especially the ones we have lost, and enjoy all of the life and happiness that this special time brings. We must always remember that we are making memories that will help to carry us through the rough times to come.
Normally when you cross borders you only have to worry about a valid passport (don’t forget it needs to be good for at least 6 months), and your visa. With Kosovo and Serbia things get a bit more complicated. There is an ambiguous international legal rational for Kosovo; a battle in the Security Council between the US, Russia and China over sovereignty and self-determination; a unilateral declaration of Independence by the Kosovar Government (supported by 65 countries in the world, but not the UN); and the blanket denial of that independence by Serbia, which maintains parallel government functions in parts of Kosovo. By now you may be wondering if there is a border or not…there is…depending on who you ask.
I was down in the balmy lowlands for what we call “Culture Committee.” Between myself and a crack-squad of likeminded volunteers, we crafted a book of volunteer stories related to cultural issues and an entire curriculum to be presented to the new batch of volunteers during their training, set to begin in April. We sought to provide a palatable presentation of everything from cultural basics like removing shoes upon entering a house, to more complex, highly emotional issues, like bride kidnapping.
Finally we broke through to the calmer side of the island, The rain was lighter here, waves calmer, we could see the coast of Thailand in the distance and everyone seemed to breath easier now we were sheltered on this side of the island.
This was high season and spoilt and busy? We were soaked and there was no place to stay, yet after the noisy crowds of the other islands, this was a chance to exhale.
Just over a week ago, reports surfaced that a Toyota Prius driver in San Diego was driving along a highway when his car became unresponsive. Police were called and helped stop the vehicle. In a press conference today, however, Toyota officials said they found significant inconsistencies in the driver's story. Toyota had engineers on hand to answer technical questions of reporters, who were also given test drives. "To say this situation was sensationalized would be an enormous understatement," Mike Michels, a Toyota spokesman, said.The driver in question, James Sikes, called 911 to report his Prius was out of control and that the accelerator pedal didn't respond. A cop caught up with Sikes as he drove up to 90 miles an hour. Toyota officials inspected the car as well as did the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, a report over the weekend indicated they didn't find anything wrong either.Despite the discrepancies in the drivers story, Toyota disclosed one potential issue: indication that he car's brakes were severely damaged from overheating, which would confirm Sikes' story. Also, according to the USA TODAY, there was an indication in one system that the brakes and accelerator had been pushed alternately, as if he were having trouble. But other than that, Michels said the Toyota probe of the Prius has found:
Men have more muscle mass, which burns fat therefore their metabolism is more active allowing them to burn off calories easier. Also, Men are socialized to want different foods than women like meats and starches, its not masculine for a man to crave a box of chocolates
I have grown to appreciate the shopping options in Singapore after living in some meager environments. However, skip the boring sameness of Orchard Street, where all you will find is high end shops carrying the same Louis Vuitton bags you can find back home. For something funkier hit the youth energized Bugis Street. Packed with hip handmade clothing stalls and accessories, this is where you can find bargains and maintain a bit of personal identity and style. Practice your negotiation skills, or just soak in the teaming market atmosphere as stall owners struggle to be noticed and shoppers hunt for the perfect Friday night outfit.
(Day 701 on the road) After resting my tired bones from the nine-day hike I had just completed, it was finally time to pick up Suzanne from the airport in Queenstown. Suzanne and I have been very good friends ever since we met at university in Hong Kong many years ago, and it was great to see her again (we had last met up in Singapore some 12 months ago). She will be travelling with me here in New Zealand for the next two weeks, and we both have been looking forward to this for a while now.
Unfortunately, as all cancer patients know, you can never completely get away from your body's assault on itself.  Leading up to the book launch, my PSA started climbing quickly, evidence the cancer was actively spreading.  The day after the launch, I had another test and found it had jumped way past what it was when I was first diagnosed and we have been unable to pinpoint where it is growing, which is cause for much anxiety.  In the meantime, the pain in my back is increasing.  I tried another type of hormone in a bid to slow things down, but the side effects drove me off that after only a week.
I think any universal health care plan would have to come with a income based scheme or means testing. If you can afford to pay for health care you should pay, however you would be able to recieve a percentage back through a medicare rebate scheme.
As Karen and Jay mentioned, all signs point to Speaker Pelosi using the "self-executing rule" to deem the Senate health care bill passed without a full vote on anything but the reconciliation package of fixes. House Dems really don't want to have an "aye" for the Senate bill's warts on their record (the "Cornhusker Kickback" ads practically write themselves.) But I would make two points: Voters aren't aware/won't remember/don't care about parliamentary process; it will be passage or not, "yes" or "no" at issue in November. And political attack ads are neither nuanced nor given to dogged devotion to the truth. Saying, "I didn't vote to pass it, I agreed to deem it passed" is hardly a line that will stick with voters, and it invites charges of Kerryesque flipfloppery. If there's any risk in "deem and pass" (Ezra Klein thinks there is,) the fact that Democrats are pursuing it is a strong indication the Republican spook campaign succeeded. Nate Silver identifies ten House Democrats who could plausibly face primary challenges from their left if they vote "no." Interestingly, six of the ten are from New York (late filing deadline,) where the labor-powered Working Families Party has threatened to withhold support.
My time in Oman also made me aware of how quickly globalisation is making the world smaller, less varied and less wild. By age 13, villages I had visited aged 11 had telegraph poles running to them, one quaint fishing community had sprouted a giant stone harbour and the dirt track that had served as the main coast road had a new tarmac highway under construction next to it. They were all changes for the better but they gave me the idea that in my lifetime there would be no more opportunities to explore or meet people who lived in a radically different way from me.
This must have been serious storm as the deep-sea fishing boats were turning and heading for shore, their grey and hardy hulls taking cover for the night.
When a partner isn't fully in the moment of trying to fix a relationship, the work becomes a one-sided affair. You need to be able to fully be there for your partner when you need to work through tough times. This might mean that you need to take a few days off work or devote certain times to discussing ways to fix your relationship. These times should be uninterrupted by work obligations or time commitments so that neither person feels rushed or distracted.

Yea its all about the muscle guys have alot bigger muscle index than chicks and are naturally more bigger or taller than chicks. They take a higher calorie intake which means sometimes girls might eat the same as a guy but when you look at it the girl will eat more calories than they should and the guy will be at the calorie level he needs because guys have higher calorie intakes than girls. well thats how I see it ;) But yeah muscle helps burn calories faster making you lose weight and gain lean mass.
If the answers to these questions are mostly negative then it could be a sign that your relationship is on the rocks. It's certainly not healthy for a relationship to consist of frequent arguments, violence or demeaning behaviour. If you are experiencing any emotional, verbal or physical abuse, then it's definitely time to call it quits.
This is quite remarkable. I may be wrong--and commenters are welcome to correct me--but I can't remember another ethnic or religious lobbying group publicly siding with a foreign country against the President of the United States...especially when the country in question is engaging in behavior that the international community believes is illegal. Once again, every U.S. President since Richard Nixon has called for a freeze of settlements being built in Palestinian areas, including East Jerusalem, conquered by Israel in 1967. AIPAC stands, with Israel, against every one of those Presidents.
But this is different: Israel is clearly in the wrong and, according to the Petraeus briefing, it is hurting American foreign policy in the region. In fact, Israel is doubly wrong: its non-stop lobbying for war with Iran is also exceedingly dangerous (the US Joint Chiefs of Staff have unanimously counseled against war with Iran). The fact that David Petraeus, a hero to many on the right, is concerned about Israel's intransigence should give AIPAC and the neocons pause. It won't, but it should.
Christmas itself was wonderful.  It can be a very difficult time for someone with cancer as the disease becomes a giant elephant in the room and can often make it difficult to really enjoy the spirit of the holidays.  When I was first diagnosed seven years ago, I didn't even want to have Christmas as I didn't think we had anything to celebrate.  But this year, we surrounded ourselves with family ( including friends we now consider as family) and had a wonderful time.  Having my nephew's two-year old son Levi here provided that wide-eyed child component and my eighty-nine year old mother provided a link to a lifetime off Christmas memories.  It was the best Christmas I've had for many years and was very important to me as I worry more and more about what the future brings.
There are two ways you and your spouse can separate: either with an informal separation or by a formal legal separation. An informal separation is basically whatever the two of you agree it to be. Typically, one of you stays in the home you had previously shared, and the other moves into some other quarters. At this stage you normally wouldn't make any formal property division, but you would agree, informally, on some kind of working arrangement about possession of things like cars, the bank accounts, the credit cards, and the stereo.
Mr. Ho and his business partner. If you see them at the train station you can trust them. Maybe. But what a great story if everything went horribly, horrible wrong. The perks of being a travel writer. To my disappointment nothing happened except arriving safely at the zoo, ticket in hand. Mr. Ho and his young business partner are an unlikely pairing. He is tall, has salt and pepper hair and looks like he could be her father. They run the service 3 times a day, once in the afternoon and twice between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm (one way only), and earn their money from buying tickets in bulk. It only takes 20 minutes and is faster than the public bus service. Give them a try if you are lucky enough to emerge from Ang Mo Kio station and they are parked outside.
Thanks again to everyone who's given us feedback on this project. And above all special thanks to both Leroy and Laurie - Leroy for encouraging us to continue the community and Laurie for helping us make it happen. This community wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.
I am slowly trying to get back to writing regularly and am hoping, in the next few days to take time off and at least write small pieces. Over the last few months, I had some big, hairy audacious ideas for blogs but never could translate them into an actual post. Clearly because I was lazy to sit in one place for long enough to complete them. But I also believe it has to do with the medium - A blog, personally, gives you just one shot at getting it right. I have never re-written any of my blog posts or re-read old ones in an effort to make them better. Once they are written (after minor changes and re-writes, immediately afterwards), they are set in stone.

Arvind from Bangalore says, Brian Lara has called for the establishment of a centralised academy for the various cricket-playing islands in the Caribbean to groom young talent. Lara said West Indies relied too much on the natural ability of players. Have West Indies always had poor infrastructure? If so, how did they manage to dominate world cricket in the 1970s and 80s?

Do not be so dejected.This is the layer which has been created by him,ie,Mr Gadkari.This team will be given responsibility to deliver

Those who fail may even be replaced in the days to come.

A pessimist is one who ses the darkness in the light.An optimist is one who sees the light in the darkness

So be optimistic about the outcome

People choose whom they wish to choose, and not the names.The performance makes the people to choose the party.Names that matters-then does not matters.See How Mr mani Shankar Iyer has lost the election this time, and how after losing the battle in the first count,Mr Chidambaram won the battle after recounting

Do not be so broken.These are the early days.More wopuld follow

What a game! It was one of the best Final's I have seen in a while and India played brilliantly to clinch the First Twenty Twenty World Cup defeating Pakistan. So the record of not losing to Pak in any WC still holds.

Watched every ball of this match with nail biting excitement. India has this knack of putting themselves in difficult situations when it should have been an easy wrap up. During Pak batting the game was mostly in India's favor except for the last 20 balls when Bajji and Sreeshanth were hit for 5 sixes. When will India learn to bowl well in the last overs? But they held their nerve and pulled it off.

Hats off to Dhoni and the young Indian team!!! They really were winners!!!
For more than a year , I have been listening to her polambals during tea breaks .I must agree that it has been pretty entertaining . I have been subjected to similar tortures , that includes having to eat what she cooked ....and still , when I want to share something important , she is one of the first person who comes to my mind .
Bhu ..u rock :).
archana!!! to me a very good and silent girl!!! didnt know much of her even though we were in the same bus.. she always has a look as though she has just woken up from sleep lol!! has a nice set of friends.. just chatting with them makes me feel as though i have entered their gang..maybe she talks a lot only with her close friends.. on the whole good, silent, sleepy girl
In real life, Alice struggles with the burdens of impending adulthood, seemingly unable to fit in with the standards of society. Moments after being proposed to, Alice falls back through the rabbit hole. 

It is prophesied that, in order to defeat the Red Queen, Alice will side with the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and kill the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee).

However, there is doubt over whether Alice is the "real" Alice. The White Rabbit doesn't believe she is, while the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) wholeheartedly believes Alice is indeed the "real" Alice.
Super Star Rajni next movie "Enthiran" with ace director Shankar and his dream crew has begun shooting recently......So i thought let me put my insights about the movie and do Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat(SWOT)  analysis about the movie....I dont want the readers feel that i will be biased in doing this analysis as i have a penchant for Rajni....i assure that it will be done in a neutral manner...

STRENGTH:
The greatest strength of the movie is Rajni-Shankar-Rahman combination,this combination has been a great success in "SIVAJI" and they proved their mettle in that blokbluster.Technical crew for "enthiran" is one of the strong points for the movie.....Ratnavelu for cinematography,anthony for editing,Yuen Woo Ping who handled stunt for many Hollywood movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Matrix and Kill Bill has been roped in for "Endhiran".

WEAKNESS:
Writer Sujatha's demise is one of the weakness for the movie.....He has been instrumental in Shankar's success since "boys"...It is also believed that story of enthiran was written by him...One of the weakness of "sivaji" was it lacked a coherent story,the same can be repeated in Enthiran....Aishwarya rai  roles in recent movies except "guru" were very lackadaisical....Hope shankar provides a meaty role which has a scope for acting.....
Here i am back with another review. I always keep thinking about having a plastic surgery. always wanted to tune my nose. I wanted to get a great nose. I am not just bubbling around and just saying i just want it with any reason. It doesn't meant that i do not like my original nose. I just wanna tune it to make it better than before. But, finding a great plastic surgeon is another hectic job .I do not want it to be a hard job. It should be simple for me to handle it but nowadays it is becoming more difficult than before.

A high fee too makes this process more difficult. But lucky for me, i have this website.They have many kinds of plastic surgery and they review their prices too. So it is easy for anyone to make a choice before going to any plastic surgery. For those women out there who want to enlarge their breast size, you can go to this website and make your dream come true. This website is all about Plastic Surgery. You can check out this site if you would want some information related to plastic surgery .You can check the location of the Plastic surgery clinic and make your way there as soon as possible.

I assure you that the quality of their service is great. If you want to have a Beverly Hills breast augmentation, you should visit this link. You can see there are many types of surgery that you can do .You will be impressed by their service. You can also get tummy tuck in Beverly hills .You can remove excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen to tighten the muscle of the abdominal wall. You will look more beautiful than before and you will feel more confident.

I took some heat in e-mail and here on our comments section for my recent piece about what I saw as fanboy whining over the Captain America casting process, and I want to clarify something... I don't think fandom is a bad thing.  I think it is the thermometer by which we measure the passion for various properties or characters, and that's a great thing.  I also think fandom, when focused, can be an incredibly valuable force in the process, and this is one of those times.  I think it becomes "whining" when you're second-guessing something you can't accurately judge because you haven't see the materials, when you don't know how an audition went, or when you simply leap to a conclusion from an emotional place.  In the case of Norton's Banner, you already have some sense of what he brings to the role.  The real question now is, "Do you consider him a piece of the puzzle, and do you want him back?"  If the answer is yes, then I think it's time to clearly communicate that to Marvel.
Chelsea V Liverpool - live on ESPN at 21:25 IST on sunday
It will be for the 17th time that these 2 sides will be meeting since Rafael Benitez became the Liverpool manager and since then they have won only 5 times n Chelsea have won 8 times. Liverpool currently struggling for good results will be without their star striker Fernando Torres, who is suffering from a hamstring injury but is expected to return for the Champions League clash against Inter in 10 days time. Also missing will be Voronin, Arbeloa, Aurelio and Agger. Xabi Alonso is suspended. Babel too might miss due to a knock he picked up during the midweek while on international duty. Chelsea will be without Terry and Shevchenko while Lampard and Mikel could be playing. I hate to say this but Chelsea may win comfortably unless Liverpool put up a spirited performance to at least manage a draw.
Prediction - Chelsea 1 - 0 Liverpool 

Manchester United v Manchester City - live on ESPN at 18:55 IST on sunday
One of the biggest derby games in England is the Manchester derby. Manu have lost thrice this season and all of those came when Rooney did not play. Rooney will miss this game due to suspension. Also missing from United squad will be Evra, Neville and Saha. Duo of Corluka and Elano are suspended for City and Richards is also likely to be rested after knee complaint. Zimbabwe forward Benjani will be making his City debut. City have not won at Old Trafford since 1974 and this year too wont be different. Having lost 3 - 1 to Arsenal at home, City have almost no chance of winning at Old Trafford.
Prediction- Manchester United 3 - 0 Manchester City
VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. This has been a departure and therefore I am all praise for the award being bestowed on VK Murthy, a generous kind and humble human, one with whom I had the great pleasure of working in two films - Nastik and Ram Balram. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum is keen to put the lessons learned from a difficult 2009 IPL into practice during this year's tournament.

McCullum is in the middle of a home series against Australia. New Zealand lost the Chapell-Hadlee series 3-2 and the teams will meet in Wellington on Friday for the first of two Test matches. With the 2010 IPL successfully underway amongst security fears, McCullum is still waiting on clearance before confirming his involvement but was eager to participate in the competition because of its massive impact on the cricketing world.

She started off by asking me not to snoop around her profile but now we ended up being the bestest of friends!
Loyalty, childishness, bubliness and sense of humour are her trademark!
They say Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you always know they are there. She is just like that!
She values and treasures her friend much more than her life! And not to forget her craze for Suriya! An ardent fan, she is! All the time going gaga over suriya!
She loves her sister to the core and her CASPER! Just the kid, as she is, still at heart!
You would know the value of true friendship when you are with her. Great to have a friend like YOU dear! Here is to the 100 more years of friendship and fun! Cheers! God Bless you!

That was a very interesting and nice write-up. I could relate to most of the incidents/things mentioned but I have come to the conclusion " You cannot please everyone and you also dont have to please everyone". People will be there to advice,complain or comment whether you do things right or wrong....If someone very close to you offers advice/suggestion, it is worth pondering as they (this person ha ha)might see things differently....For the rest, just listen and move on!!
Our country celebrated it's 62nd independence day today.The main essence of celebrating the independence day is to remember our heroes who fought for our country to gain independence from the hands of British.But is it the real case happening in our country.It's really a question to ponder. when we start from school life,the students are asked to come to the school and some chief guest will come and hoist the flag and students will clap.Then the chief guest will be rendering some useless speech and students should clap for it and they will be given a chocolate and return home so that they can spend the other part of the day happily watching TV shows and movies telecasting in it.
When you take the TV channels instead of putting shows on how India got freedom or at least a film taken on patriotism they will be telecasting a film of masala genre.So the children don't know anything about the national heroes.So the Gen Next would also be knowing anything of the national heroes and slowly the main essence of independence day is being forgotten.And it will be considered most of holiday than a day of remembering our heroes.
The worst of all this someone given to pinup the flag in his shirt and he is doing it outside.Even the political leaders exchange wishes only and instead of remembering their heroes they will be thinking of how to impress the people with the help of this day by giving some useless speeches. Worst of all this is Vodafone which charges for sms on special occasions stopped charging on this day and that tells the significance of the day.
Most tools will let you convert a partition from one file type to another, i.e. from NTFS to FAT/FAT32 or vice versa. Needless to say that in most cases, such a conversion, especially from NTFS to FAT/FAT32 will cause the files to lose their NTFS permissions (ACLs), and in some cases where EFS was used to encrypt the files, it will actually cause you to lose access to these files. So beware!

Some of these tools may be able to help you recover deleted partitions, and if data on that disk was un-damaged, actually help you gain access to that data. Some, but not all of the tools may have the ability to move existing partitions from one location on the disk to another location, again, without losing data.
