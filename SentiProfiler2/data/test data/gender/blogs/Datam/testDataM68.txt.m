Sunday Funday!  Got a call from old pal today who wanted to meet me. And since i am not "Busy" i agreed! We went to Ambiance Mall, which i guess is one of the biggest Mall in India.

The gentry was beyond expectation, lots to drool on:)) We also did play pool and then came back for Pizza @Dominoes.

In the end it turned out to be good Sunday rather then usual lazy ones!       Long Weekend!
Long weekend approaching yet again and i wasn't prepared as usual. Too many things going and my mind is definitely working overtime so need a break! I checked for available tickets and booked for Dehradun.

It would have been good if i had a company but then i don't want to be in city inspite as well. I am planning to go to Mussorie, a place where i had went during my childhood days once and have some memories to cheer!

Hopefully i would be able to meet Mr. Ruskin Bond who lives there. His stories about Shamli and Dehra are still so fresh. I have absolutely no plans to have any kind of adventure, just want to be there with the nature and sit back and relax..........
