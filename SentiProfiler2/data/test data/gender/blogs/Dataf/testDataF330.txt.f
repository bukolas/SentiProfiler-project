I probably could not have taken on this project if I didn't have a nice long summer break in the middle of the year. I'm looking forward to eating lunches I prepare myself. However... I'm thinking about doing some kind of extension of the project over the summer. I am definitely going to do some kind of "cleanse" in June. Nothing crazy, but more of a "30 days of whole foods." It would be fun to travel to a country where school is in session and see what they are eating. That would be hard to swing, but it would be so interesting. Or I could try to make a healthy lunch every day for the cost of a school lunch $2.92 (per the School Nutrition Association). The average school lunch program gets reimbursed at $2.68, leaving a shortfall. I think I could make a healthy lunch for $1.00 per day. Have any ideas for what I should do over the summer? You guys are so creative.
