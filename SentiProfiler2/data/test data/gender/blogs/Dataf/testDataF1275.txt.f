hiva.....a bubbly pal of mine...always fueled with energy...she really is a fantasy n a freak-out...dotes on her fav hang-outs n food stalls...d next thing she adores is her friends...she cares 4 her pals like no one else...n u can feel free to share anything with her....very open-minded n a bit of a tomboy sometimes:)...hav never met another one like her since high-school..she is at her best when she 'kalaichi'fies people:)...n always out with an ear 4 rumours n buzzes...a person who can talk her mind freely wherever she believes thr is a need to do so...a thing i admire abt her: once she decides abt something, she'll put her foot down n wudn't stop till she has achieved her objective...n an independent decision-maker...i respect her courage n daring:)..i can go on n on abt thz dynamic lady but tat wud only limit d possibilities of wat she can be..so i stop here n wish u a very bright future.chase ur dreams!!.u hav d potential 2 be wat u wanna be..u r ma best pal n am always thr wen u need me k!!:)
