We had a good time in Dolores Park, and we hope that you had some fun in the dark too. Here are some photos from before and during the event at Dolores: Ok this is very cool...our friends at Google have "turned out the lights" on their homepage for users in the Bay Area. I can see it but some friends are not seeing it yet. It may take some time for the page to find its way to all the local servers? They have written a special page for us as well: http://www.google.com/lightsoutsf/ Thanks Google! Turn off your lights from 8-9pm and do one of the following, or think up your own way to make good things happen in the dark! -Treat yourself (and someone else) to a candlelight dinner at one of our participating restaurants . -Help us out by taking photos and emailing them to pictures@lightsoutsf.org . -JOIN US IN DOLORES PARK FOR FREE MUSIC!!! Yet another signal of support from our fearless leader in Sacramento. Governor Schwarzenegger shares his support for Lights Out San Francisco. He calls it an "illuminating" event! We just learned that our very own, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi issued a statement in support of Lights Out. Thanks very much for the support... -------------------------------- Pelosi Statement on Lights Out San Francisco Washington, D.C. â€“ Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued the following statement regarding Lights Out San Francisco, a city-wide conservation event in which organizers are inviting the entire San Francisco community to install one compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) and turn off all non-essential lighting from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.: "Climate change presents a challenge to the survival of our planet. While there is an urgent need for decisive action to address climate change and greenhouse gas reduction nationally and globally, we must act locally as well. "Solutions to the climate crisis must be as local as our neighborhoods and as global as the planet. By taking part in Lights Out San Francisco, each resident will be taking a positive step towards reducing green house gases emissions on a local level. "Thank you to the visionary organizers of Lights Out San Francisco and to the many businesses, residents and visitors who will participate in turning out the lights in San Francisco and helping to reduce the energy consumption in our city." This just in. Our good friends at Craigslist posted a link from their homepages in San Francisco and LA. Thanks guys...this will definitely help raise awareness of our event and save energy. A big thanks to Raymond, Ryan and their friends at Holy Name School! They helped us pass out CFLs and information about LOSF at their elementary school. You guys have been a great help!
