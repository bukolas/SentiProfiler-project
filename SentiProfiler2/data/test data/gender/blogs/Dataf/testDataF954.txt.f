Today I finished the rough draft of Hecate's Own! WOOT!

When you look at the word count meter it will tell you I still have roughly 2500 words to go before I hit 60k. Well I can tell you I'm going to break the 60k mark in the Grinder. I already know I need at least two more love scenes. Some questions remain unanswered that really should be in this book. Some questions should be added or deleted for the third book (which is looking more and more like it might be Gareth and Gen rather than Daniel and Kerry). And the final fight scene needs some beefing up.

So yeah, by the time I'm done I'm pretty sure I'll hit around 65k. I'm planning on hitting that mark by Monday, at which point I send this off to the Betas. Think I should warn them?
