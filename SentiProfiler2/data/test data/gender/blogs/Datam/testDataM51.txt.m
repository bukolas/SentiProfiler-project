No gay governor in South Carolina

They'd rather have the corrupt guy stay in power:
"We can't impeach for hypocrisy. We can't impeach for arrogance. We can't impeach an officeholder for his lack of leadership skills," said Rep. James Harrison, the Columbia Republican who headed the panel.
Can't impeach hypocrisy? Well, at least Andre Bauer is safe.

It may shock you to learn...


...that an anti-gay pol has been caught in a sex scandal:
Detective Bethany McDermott's affidavit says Jetton went to the woman's home around 9 p.m. Nov. 15 with two bottles of wine, which he allegedly opened alone in her kitchen. After drinking some of the wine and watching football, the statement said, the victim "began ‘fading' in and out and remembered losing consciousness several times."

The affidavit says Jetton and the alleged victim agreed on a safe word - "green balloons" - that could be used to stop sexual relations during the evening.
One of BlogActive's biggest fans pointed out that I should have included this snippet from an article in the Kansas City Star:
Instead, the affidavit says, Jetton hit her on the face and choked her before engaging in intercourse. Jetton allegedly said, "You should have said 'green balloons,' before leaving her home the next morning.

Charlie's Angels?


Florida governor’s child health recording directed callers to sex chat line:
In spite of government claims to the contrary, no horny girls are standing by to help your child get health insurance.

It's a state-sponsored blooper for the ages: for two months, a recording by Florida Governor Charlie Crist played when parents called KidCare to get advice on health policies for their children. In the audio, Crist gave a number to call for more information. As it happened, that number was a little off.

Instead of details on child health care, callers were redirected to this: 'Hey there, sexy guy. Welcome to an exciting new way to go live, one on one, with hot, horny girls waiting right now to talk to you.'
