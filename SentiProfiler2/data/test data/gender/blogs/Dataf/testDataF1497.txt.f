How was everyone's weekend? Well last week I did promise I would 'do' a post (is that proper blog-inology?) about my Television work in Australia and the US over the past 6 years, so here goes!

At the ripe age of 20, fresh out of Griffith University where I studied Film and Media (there you go Simon Cowell, I am well educated :), I landed my first major gig hosting a daily kids show on the Nine Network Aust. called 'Hot Source'. This was my training ground for hosting, editing, segment producing, and script writing.My next major move was hosting the daily show 'Studio Disney' on the Disney Channel. I LOVED loved loved this job so much! I was lucky enough to travel around the world and Australia, and work with the most amazing team. Disney really taught me a lot about the international TV industry, and the work ethics and brand values they hold are second to none.
