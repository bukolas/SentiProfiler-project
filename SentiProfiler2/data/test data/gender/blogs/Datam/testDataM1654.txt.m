I was at the public library last Friday. I was working on a sermon. In a carrel across from me was a man with his back to me. I first noticed him because he was a LOUD typer. Every keystroke echoed through the library. I couldn't have been the only to notice. I tried my best to keep my mind on what I was doing but every once in a while his fingers would whirl across the keyboard and the noise would echo out. So, I would look over at him and then I noticed; he was surfing MySpace sites that had gay men in provocative poses and they were unclothed.
To each his own.
But, please, don't use a public computer for that!
I suspect he was using the library computer because there would be no record of where he was or what he was looking at. Had he been surfing those sites at work he likely would have been looking at some disciplinary action.
But, I didn't need to see that.
Please don't use a public computer for that
