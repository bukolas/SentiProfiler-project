Ivor Reveley (check out the “Gotta Run” t-shirt) On whether he has done such a thing before… Two years ago, on his fiftieth birthday, Ivor and a team of runners ran from Romford to Orpington.&#160; They ran 50kms over 50 hours to raise money for 50 young people with autism.&#160; Ivor broke that down for me and explained that it is not as impossible as it sounds (bearing in mind that I walk a 5km fun run once a year): you run for two to three hours a day over three days and cover about 20 kilometres a day.&#160; It is not easy but it is possible! They raised £8,500 on that occasion which meant that their charity CASPA was able to obtain viability and get the real start that it required.&#160; This is so important, as Ivor explains, because it meant that the charity could remain a stable entity in the lives of the children and families it serves. On why he was raising money for CASPA? Ivor's sixteen-year-old son has autism.&#160; After being a charity trustee for fifteen to twenty years, Ivor realised that he had the skill necessary to make a difference in the lives of other children with autism and he decided to get involved with CASPA. On what CASPA is and what they do... Ivor is the chair and trustee of the charity.&#160; They started off as an informal parents’ association in 2002 and formally registered the charity in 2005.&#160; As a charity, they run events and workshops for young people with autism such as: Brighton Beach kid’s days out Youth Club on a Friday night A residential week long summer camp Independent Living Workshops (which are sponsored by the LDA ) They have received brilliant feedback from the children who say it is a safe environment for them to have fun, free from bullying or other such concerns. On making the runs interesting… After completing A-levels in Economics, Geography and Maths, Ivor went on to study Economics at university. An avid map lover, Ivor is now using his Geography and Maths skills again as he plans the most historical and geographically interesting routes through cathedrals and up high streets.&#160; The idea is for the runners to enjoy these events and to see and learn about the places they run through. On this year’s event… Date: 30 April – 3 May 2010. Route: Clapham Common to Brighton Beach ( route details ) Ivor hopes to do events like this every even year and this year they will be doing a four day run from Clapham to Brighton.&#160; Ivor is keeping a log of all of the training and organising of the event in his blog Four Days Running . A half marathon is 21km and these runners will be doing more than that each day as they will run from about 2.30pm to 5pm every day for four days. Friends, family and supporters will be able to meet up with the runners every evening as pub nights are being organised on Facebook and the hotels that the group is staying in is published on the site ( stay on route ). This is not a public run but anyone interested in joining the run can contact Ivor at the site to get involved.&#160; They have a photographer taking part this year so expect great photos! On how YOU can help… You can donate money using the button above.&#160; That will take you to the Just Giving site where the money will go straight to the charity and won’t touch anyone’s hands. But don’t worry, there are lots of other ways to help too: Follow the Four Days Running blog Follow Ivor’s Twitter account: @revivor .&#160; Join the fun and do the four day run: Run With Us Stay on the route and be a supporter If you are reading this anywhere besides Emm in London or in an RSS reader then the content is stolen.

Barely a day goes by when we don’t hear of someone’s tales of woe with regards to their finances. Maybe nary a day goes by when you don’t think of your OWN tales of personal finance horror, but this post isn’t about personal finances, in fact, this post isn’t even going to be particularly serious in the slightest, perhaps a welcome break from the drudgery we encounter on a day-to-day basis. This post is for those who dare to dream, who occasionally – or often, there’s no discrimination at play here – have flights of fancy where they can afford whatever they please, consequences be damned. Food. Everyone loves food. Of course, there are picky eaters, gluttons who eat anything and then there’s the gourmet, who will indulge in only the finest of fripperies wherever food is concerned. You’ve probably guessed where this is going and it’s headed in a direction in which the subject matter will revolve around the finest/most expensive eating establishments in Britain, avoiding the cliché that is the “world’s most expensive” and instead opting for the lower-key “just in Britain” subtitle, so maybe you’ll want to bear these in mind next time you’re booking any flights to London . There are no diamonds in food, gemstones on cutlery-related shenanigans here, for these places are expensive because…well…they just ARE. London, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay Also one of the single most expensive restaurants in the world, this place can set you back at least £120 for a single person and that’s just selecting from the average stuff. If you were to opt for more exquisite dishes and then a bottle or wine or so, well, then you’re looking at a hefty price-tag indeed! A favorite amongst locals and tourists alike (provided that can afford it, of course), the restaurant itself is known for serving up the most palate-pleasing dishes in the whole of England’s fine capital city. Typical delights on offer might include Cornish lamb, pork belly and the finest Angus beef, all mixed in with a wide range of other fine accoutrements. By the time you were done with this place, you’d certainly be in a better position to understand the reason behind the three Michelin Stars that have been awarded to it. However, your wallet might not be! Berkshire, Waterside Inn Put on the proverbial map thanks to fantastic food, a three-star Michelin chef in the form of owner Michel Roux and a £24 plum soufflé that made it onto the Forbes list of the world’s most expensive desserts (it came tenth), the Waterside Inn is not only a dive into opulence, but also a dive into quality as those stars aren’t awards to just anyone that comes along. With “Inn” in the title, you’d be correct in suspecting that the building housing the restaurant also serves as a place where you can – for a modest sum – spend a few nights. The restaurant’s chefs serve the whole gamut of dishes you’d expect: lobster, rabbit, lamb, duck, turbot and many others, each served as decadently and in an adept a fashion as you’d imagine. Truly an experience for the rich in taste as well as the rich in wealth, as you will most likely be set back around £100+ for a two-course meal. London, Sketch Back to the nation’s capital again, for meals that again breach the £100 mark. Sketch has long been touted as an incredibly expensive place to eat, hence the gaggle of celebrities and other people of note that occasionally dine at the establishment. However, the price doesn’t belie the quality and instead is more of an indication of it, what with the restaurant itself being a product of Algerian restaurateur Mourad Mazouz and celebrated French chef Pierre Gagnaire, you can rest assured that the place will contain nothing less than the most sumptuous of everything the culinary realm has to offer.

Please report stolen content to missus.emm@gmail.com Copyright 2008-2009 Missus Emm http://missus-emm.blogspot.com 3mm154m2ndy On Tuesday night, we went to see the Garrick Theatre production of Douglas Carter Beane’s The Little Dog Laughed. The Little Dog Laughed is about a rising Hollywood star Mitchell (Rupert Friend) who in the words of his agent “suffers from a slight recurring case of homosexuality”.&#160; He meets rent boy Alex (Harry Lloyd) and their lives are turned somewhat upside down when they both fall for each other despite both asserting that they are not gay.&#160; The play is set against the backdrop of Hollywood and homosexuality and explores all of the double standards and difficulties with coming out in show business.&#160; There is a fantastic quote by Colin Firth in the programme which just about sums it up: “If you’re a straight actor who takes on the role of a gay man, it’s obviously not the same as being one in this business”. The Little Dog Laughed was written by Douglas Carter Beane who also wrote To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar , a 1995 film starring Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snapes.&#160; It first opened off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in 2006.&#160; The play is narrated by Mitchell’s morally challenged agent Diane (played by Tamsin Greig) who has such classic lines as &quot;A writer with the final cut? I'd rather give firearms to small children”.&#160; It is no secret really that I am a massive fan of Harry Lloyd and have spent the past three years watching each and every one of his plays but it is Greig who absolutely steals the show and her acting, wardrobe and personality all fit the role perfectly.&#160; In her role as Diane, Greig superbly breaks through the fourth wall, allowing the audience into the world of Hollywood agents, actors and writers and she did it very well indeed.&#160; She was incredibly comfortable chatting and winking to the audience one minute and then diving right back into her encounters with the rest of the cast the next. Rupert Friend plays the drunken, privileged and somewhat sheltered Mitchell really well.&#160; While I tend not to question how characters were written (as it is generally a fixed factor when putting on a play), I have to wonder at a rising Hollywood star who doesn’t get the significance of coming out to the world and the effect that could have on his career.&#160; In the end, his naiveté is what trips him up though. In an equal sense, Harry Lloyd’s Alex just doesn’t seem to understand the dynamic of his relationship with his girl pal Ellen (played by Gemma Arterton) and the effect that his growing relationship with Mitchell will have on her.&#160; He does, however, utter my favourite line of the play while trying to get a point across to Mitchell: “God, talking to you is like sewing a button on cottage cheese”. As far as rather shallow, clueless roles go, Friend and Lloyd do as well as they can do but they have both taken on much better roles in the past.&#160; The one thing they do both handle extremely well is the intimacy and affection that develops between their two characters.&#160; There is a fair bit of nudity in the play (with Harry Lloyd being fully nude at one point) and both actors were professional and convincing in their roles. Gemma Arterton was far less convincing and you got the idea that she was trying to inflate her supporting role somewhat as the character definitely shrinks in comparison to the other three.&#160; She seemed to posture a lot and to shout her lines rather than speak them with meaning and emotion.&#160; She is quite inexperienced in theatre though and this certainly didn’t ruin the play.&#160; You have to wonder though if those in casting didn’t foresee that she would be completely overshadowed by Greig (or perhaps that was the point?) This production of The Little Dog Laughed was directed by Jamie Lloyd and I must say he made good use of the space and actors.&#160; There is one invisible character, so to speak, who appears in one scene and speaks on the phone but is not played by anyone.&#160; I thought this was really well portrayed by the cast and well managed by the director. The set was designed by Soutra Gilmour who received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Set Design in 2009.&#160; While Gilmour’s sets are often dark and almost sinister, this was stark, bare and completely white but the minimalist set worked in this play.&#160; The play itself is incredibly funny and highly entertaining.&#160; It doesn’t provide any grand answers to the problems it identifies but seems to focus more on the situation at hand and how that plays out.&#160; The audience was laughing along raucously at the numerous one-liners and there was much enthusiastic clapping and cheers of “bravo!” at the end.&#160; All in all it was a fun night out and I’d certainly recommend the play for people seeking a light-hearted comedy experience. The Little Dog Laughed is playing at the Garrick Theatre until 10 April 2010.&#160; There are really good prices available on tickets at LastMinute.com and we got tickets for £29.50 each from WestEndTheatre.com .

The Drums The Drums are a post-punk band hailing from Brooklyn, New York and it is likely that you would recognise their song “Let’s Go Surfing”.&#160; They are currently on a sold out tour of UK, Ireland and mainland Europe and will be supporting Florence and the Machine on their nationwide tour starting in May. The Drums have a sound reminiscent of the punk and ska bands of the early eighties but I found them to be pretty average and unoriginal. I had not even heard of them before the night but certainly won’t be rushing off to buy any of their albums.&#160; Most importantly, I have never seen a bunch of people look so uncomfortable on a stage before.&#160; I’ve seen cheesy robotic dancing before and singers playing air drums but it is clear that The Drums have a long way to go as a band before they make that look cool. &#160; The Big Pink The Big Pink are the reason we went to the Shockwaves NME Awards Tour this year and it is safe to say that I am a massive fan of their album A Brief History of Love which I reviewed on BlogCritics 
n January.&#160; The Big Pink arrived on stage with lights and explosions and their whole set was energetic, frenetic and loud.&#160; Their songs were much heavier than they had sounded on their CD and it was a manic mash up of squealing guitars and noise. I imagine that this signals a heavier direction for their new album but it could also be overcompensation for the fact that most of their music is pre-recorded and sampled.&#160; That meant that vocalist Robbie Furze was screaming his vocals and grinding his guitar while we debated amongst ourselves whether the bassist and drummer weren’t in fact miming.&#160; I am always happy for indie alternative bands to take on a heavier, louder sound; in fact, the noisier the better as far as I am concerned.&#160; But this was not a great performance.&#160; I’ve seen many bands that use heavy sampling including The Prodigy, Dan le Sac vs Scroobius Pip and Faithless and it is so difficult to put on a great show in front of a massive audience when the majority of your band members are doing little on the actual night but miming.&#160; The Big Pink didn’t really get it right on Saturday night. Bombay Bicycle Club Bombay Bicycle Club hail from north London and took their name from a string of curry restaurants in the area.&#160; I have no idea what I expected from them before I heard them play on Saturday night as I had barely even heard of them but wasn’t in the least bit interested in listening to any of their music. I certainly didn’t expect to have them rock my socks off.&#160; Seconds into their first song, I found myself debating whether to rush off to the shops the next day or order their album through Amazon.&#160; Thankfully, such debates were soon put out of my mind as I got caught up in their energetic, enthusiastic set.&#160; The one thing they did prove was that the problems with the previous two acts weren’t down to bad acoustics in the venue because their whole sound and lights show was fabulous.&#160; Jack Steadman has a fantastically unique voice and the band are confident and exciting on stage.&#160; Oh, and they can dance.&#160; Perhaps the guys from The Drum need to take some dancing lessons from them.&#160; The crowd went mad for them and I would have to say that Bombay Bicycle Club were the best band of the night.&#160; It is not often that I am won over to unknown bands during a live performance but they were that good. The Maccabees The Maccabees played a massive fifteen song set on Saturday night and gave one of the most impressive live performances I have seen in years.&#160; The Maccabees are from south London but are currently based in London.&#160; They have five full time members but their incredible show included three musicians on brass instruments and at one stage Edwyn Collins joined them to sing “Rip It Up”.&#160; The Maccabees use the whole stage and everything from their backdrop to their set up and lighting is absolutely professional and first class.&#160; I honestly found myself widening my eyes to try drink everything in.&#160; Like with Bombay Bicycle Club, the sound was perfect and the crowd went absolutely mad for The Maccabees.&#160; They didn’t quite have the impact on me that Bombay Bicycle Club did but that is not to say that they weren’t brilliant.&#160; They were really good and I’d definitely go see them again sometime. After a rocky start, the ShockWaves NME Awards Tour 2010 was a huge success and Bombay Bicycle Club and The Maccabees certainly made up for a slightly shaky start.&#160; The best thing about the O2 Brixton Academy of course is that after the show, we were able to nip into Nandos for some chicken burgers thus avoiding the British tradition of the post-night out dodgy vindaloo.
