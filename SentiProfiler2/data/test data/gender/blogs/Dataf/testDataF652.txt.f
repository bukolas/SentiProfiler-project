Cooking with color is the best part of creating my own meals, and it keeps my diet well balanced and me happy!" Ventures With Veggies made this colorful tabouleh-inspired salad with leftover quinoa, diced carrots, cucumber, peppers, and some diced apple and raisins for sweetness. "The result was tasty, delicious, healthy, and filling!" Check out the recipe, called Hippie Tabouleh! More oven roasted goodness! Molly Lee writes, "I made these oven-roasted brussels sprouts for dinner tonight. They were incredible! I think even people who think they don't like brussels sprouts would enjoy these... "To make them, cut off the brown ends of your fresh sprouts and any old-looking leaves. Drop them into boiling water and cover. After 3 minutes, drain them quickly and replace the water with cold water to stop them from overcooking. "Cut in half and toss with some olive oil and salt. Lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet and put in a hot, 425 degree oven, for about 30 minutes, stirring them around occasionally. "Remove when they're gorgeously brown. They're incredible!" Hi Jennifer, Iris at The Daily Diettribe writes, "I've been making Roasted Acorn Squash and Brussels Sprouts a lot lately. Adding just a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper, and allowing it to roast until it begins to caramelize creates a sweet and delicious snack. And the brussel sprouts taste great cold the next day!" Follow the link above to the recipe! Selene writes, "Oven roasted vegetables are one of my favourite dishes to make, because it's such an easy and tasty way to get tons of veggies. Here I've paired it with a creamy garlic-y cashew sauce." Recipe at Veganlicious ! Amy wrote in to share another one with us: "I just made this and felt that someone who appreciates food and health combined should see it! I call it the SULTAN. I wrapped it up and it was unbelievably delicious, and RAW! It was made with soaked buckwheat, and lemon, coriander, sea salt, golden curry powder, tomato, cumin, and some reverse osmosis water to make it easier to blend." Jaylyn from Lipstick & Granola writes, "This was my yummy dinner the other night: white potatoes and garlic, fresh from the farmers market (yes, we have one in the winter)! I simply roasted the potatoes and garlic in the oven with pine nuts, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and served them on top of steamed Swiss chard. The flavors went perfectly together!"
