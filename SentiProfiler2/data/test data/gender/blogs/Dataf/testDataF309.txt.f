Sometimes real life has a way of interfering with life on the internet. There's been a lot of that going around lately. And sometimes it seems as if there is nothing much to say. And there's been a lot of that lately too. I'm hoping that, on the other side of all this stuff going on, that maybe I'll have a whole slew of posts about how, yes, His grip on me really was way, way stronger and more sure than my grip on Him. And maybe I'll even be able to share a little bit of what that looked like.
