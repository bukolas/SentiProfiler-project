Here's one comic-book adaptation I would dearly like to see - Wes Anderson's take on Spider-Man. It is a tale of love and photography, of responsibility and revenge; a film so arch it's practically humpbacked. For all that, The Amazing Spider-Man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears. Downplay those distracting crime-fighting elements and Peter Parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited. He is, in short, a very Andersonian antihero.
