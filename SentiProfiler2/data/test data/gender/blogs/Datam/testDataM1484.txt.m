Light Bob blends effortlessly into his surroundings, Bossu Wood, Quatre Bras 1815. "I fight for the one true King...King Jesus!" There's a few things that really capture my imagination about the English Civil War. I love the look of the Buff coated troopers of both sides with their lobster pot helmets and breastplates. Also the massive, almost out of proportion pistols of the time really appeal to me. This grim faced veteran of Cromwell's 'iron sides' knows why he fights this war and has trusted his faith to God to see It through. Wellington's Imfamous army. I think for the other Command bases I will just mix up a bit of Green stuff rather than the tricky Poly Filler. The results will be the same and a lot easier to achieve. For the Command base I tried something a little different. Knowing how Poly filler can crack and flake when dry, I gave It a wash of PVA glue to fix It. It was quite time consuming but for Command bases I don't mind pushing the boat out a little. Gloss varnish was mixed with Scorched brown and a little black to make the wet looking mud. I made small hoof and footprints in the Poly Filler with a brush and dry brushed with shades of brown. Here is the first of my three command bases. To make It a bit more enjoyable for myself I painted them one at a time rather than en Mass. This allows me to see the results a lot quicker and Is more satisfying. I tried a few things out and settled for the quickest and easiest way, with so many bases to flock It had to be something effective but fast to do. This involved flocking the base as normal but as the PVA was still wet, I pushed a brush loaded with brown paint into it to make footprints. Puddles were created by exposing the flat base underneath, when this is painted dark brown and gloss varnished, It will give the effect of a muddy puddle. Very quick and very easy.
