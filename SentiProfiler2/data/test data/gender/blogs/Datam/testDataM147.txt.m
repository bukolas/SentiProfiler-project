A reader alerts us to a story in the Dayton Daily News about a Presbyterian minister taking up the cause of housing discrimination against Hispanic immigrants. While it's unclear where the picture accompanying the story was taken, notice the Marian images -- a big no-no in Calvinist theology -- in the background. Might he be incorporating Catholic props to assist his "missionary" efforts with immigrants from Catholic strongholds in Central and South America? Even if not, it's striking that he would permit himself to be photographed for a newspaper in such a setting.
