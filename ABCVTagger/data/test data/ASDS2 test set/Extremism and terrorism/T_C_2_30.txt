Besides, I dont think we can get help from the Kuffar when the same Kuffar as waging war against our brothers and sisters in various lands around the World. The Muslim Ummah is One Ummah, so when they wage war on our brothers and sisters its like their waging war on us, regardless of our location and as such it would not be pemissible to ask them for help. The same Kuffar who are stealing our resources, defending Israel, raping our sisters, bombing our mosque, imprisoning our brothers, putting puppets as leaders in our lands, demolishing the Khilafah, fighting against Sharia Law (Afghnistan, Somalia etc) So we cant ask them for help! If the Kuffar refrained from the above completely, then it would be a different story!
