Another reason is that there are 2 seniors who have helped us a lot once we got down at Raleigh-Arun and Srinath. They treated us almost like brothers and more than just some fellow Indian. In this time of the world where at times even friends think twice about helping friends, we were really amazed at the way those 2 guys helped us out and are still helping us out. Both of them advise us so much, help us out. Arun is one amazing guy though. He takes not only us but any fresher out for shopping for groceries or clothes or laptops. He lives near my house and it is his open invitation that anyone can come into his house at any time. Most of the time, excepting after 11 pm, there are atleast 6 to 10 guys in his house, either playing the PS2 or accessing his net or just sit there for chatting with the others. More than that he is such a lively person that most of the time he is cracking jokes and making other people laugh. We realized that there is no method from our side to pay them back for all their kindness they have done for us.
