John, really you and Shankar have driven these change improvement initiatives by identifying critical business needs.  So, I greatly appreciate both of you having the passion, drive and interest to continuously improve our IT operations in the Rice Building.

Now the harder part is actually delivering results and implementing high-impact solutions for our stakeholders -- Jim, Prof Shanley, Mary, Shari, Rita, etc.... so that they can recognize the decision and efforts were worthwhile.
