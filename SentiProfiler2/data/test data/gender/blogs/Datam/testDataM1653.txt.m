I truly miss "love".

Young love was a beautiful thing. It was the most comforting thing I have ever felt.

I was never the relationship type of guy. I didn't even romantically or sexually care for females. But, after experiencing so-called, "love". I don't want to be without it.

I do wish, that I had found love with someone smarter. Someone who had a brighter thought pattern. And what upsets me the most is that i had worked hard. But, it all went to waste. And now, I have to rebuild it with someone new someday. I have no patience for that. I just want to skip to a time when I have it next.

I don't want some gross ass bitch. I don't want some dumbass slutty-type little GIRL. I want a beautiful, intelligent, mellow, logical, selfless, understanding, ladie-like female. Someone who doesn't involve herself with a grimey crowed. And does not use drugs or alcohol. Someone, I can respect. Who stays covered up. And makes logical decisions and considers most to all factors in a situation. Someone who can appreciate all things and keep me happy as well as me keep her happy.

I am afraid that I will never find that. I hate that I WANT to find love again. But, the truth is, love is a wonderful thing. I don't know what else to say. I'm sure that 'God' has someone in mind for me. And has had someone in mind for me in a while. The only problem I have is that I have become very impatient and depressed. Time has become my enemy. And that is causing me issues. I have writer's block. Goodbye for now.
