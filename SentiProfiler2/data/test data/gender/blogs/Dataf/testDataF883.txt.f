My mum bought me this lovely swirly mug for christmas. If I look at it in the light the colours on it are a creamy-rose and a faded green. But in the dark all these wonderful yellow stripes shine off it. I think it's a magical cup - oh and the pattern on it is very interesting. It's fun to watch out of the corner of my eye: if I look at it straight on it just seems to be a ordinary swirly cup, but when I'm not looking the spirals winding around it move and I sometimes forget it's not really spinning. Perhaps it is and I'm just not supposed to see... I think I'll buy another one if I ever see them. I'm excited now: it'll look so pretty when I'm writing and my two mugs just spin around on the table next to me. I won't fill them right up though: I'll just make my drink in one then pour half into the other. It'll mean twice the washing up but that's not so bad.

We've just bought a new washing-up liquid that smells so sweet, it's like a lemon, apple, and grape tree have been bred together and this smell is their new fruit. It all works though: when I close my eyes I can pretend I'm far away from England. Sometimes I wind up in Greece, sometimes in Italy and sometimes places I've never even heard of. All these wonderful places a lot of people might never get to see. If I could I'd take everyone on holiday: but alas I'm not so rich and there are far too many people. That's why this new liquid is really lovely to use, it's almost enough to just pretend I'm somewhere else. I hope they make a new smell soon, I think the dishes prefer this one too: they seem to sparkle with happiness when I've done them. So yes, I shall buy another mug. I just hope it likes the washing up liquid as much as his partner does.

My new mug swirls a lot in the water, the bubbles look like they can't stay on top of it. They keep trying to climb their way to the top but it just wipes them away again. Like when kids play in the funhouses, I remember there were these huge, cylinder rotating things and it was always a competition to see which one of us could stay on the longest. It was usually a boy with really long legs that he could wrap around the rotating thing. Everyone else would throw the coloured balls from the ball pit at him, trying to knock him off. But those balls weren't really that bad when they were threw, so he usually stayed on for a really long time, until he got tired of course, or until the bell rang for all the children with 'blue' stickers to come out because their fun time was up. But when I'm washing up, none of the bubbles can stay on the mug as long as the children in the funhouse used to. I think it's because they're so wet and slippery. Like a dolphin. I like dolphins.. no I'm lying.. I love them. No-one but me will ever understand why, and that's just how I want it to be.
