Last spring, Noah (Ethan's pistol of a little brother) wanted to do karaoke at are local amusement park. We said that he'd have to learn a song, practice, and then he could do it. To our surprise, Ethan told us that he wanted to do it too. Ethan loves to sing and watch American Idol, but I was surprised that he wanted to go up on stage and perform. He's done plays at school and always learns his lines/songs, but it was hard to get a read from him as to whether or not he enjoyed the process. It seemed like he did. He learned a song (David Cook's light on) and they both did a great job. Then last month a school notice went home about the school talent show. Little Noah loves an audience and said that he wanted to do the show. Ethan, once again said that he'd like to be in it too. They formed a trio with their friend Jake, practiced with the whole crowd of kids for 3 weeks, and performed "Just One Person" from Snoopy the musical. It's quite moving to think about Ethan enjoying performing. I always enjoyed performing and I think I'd have a hard time explaining why I liked it so. I liked the process. I liked having audience reaction. I wonder what it is? But in any case both my boys enjoy it too. I'll also admit, I'm quite emotionally moved that my little boy who wouldn't turn his head at his name, who didn't call me 'mommy' until 4 1/2 years old, and who seems to spend so much of his time in his own little world enjoys performing and did a wonderful job at the school talent show. I'm so proud of both of them.
