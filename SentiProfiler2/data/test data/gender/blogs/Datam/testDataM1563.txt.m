As I drift in and out, I can only hope that you are doing the same. Somewhere else wherever you may lay I hope you dream of delightful days with you and I. Dream of me as I dream of you, Dream of me as only you can see. Dream of me as I dream of me. Dream, just let yourself go ahead and dream...Your all I really care about. And there is no doubt that I'd wait forever and a day until your ready to be with meâ€¦
