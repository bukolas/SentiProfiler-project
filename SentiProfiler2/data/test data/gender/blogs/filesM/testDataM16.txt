I'm sitting at a conference and my phone does it's little vibraty thing. I pick it up because I'm in the midst of fighting fires at work and dreading the update from the product manager (or is it project manager... I always forget). But there is no email, there is a message from my wife - it's a picture message. I first read the caption and see "Cheese DaDa" only to see the picture load to punch me in the emotional daddy face. There is my beautiful little girl with the cutest grin.

My first reaction is "awwww", but immediately follows the, "Holy crap I miss them."

We all seem to divide our lives up into different sections.  Some go by relationships, some by children, some by jobs, debt, or even cars.  Today, I think the world is asking me to step into a new section of life and I'm not sure I want to listen to that call.  I'm 25, 1/4 dead, old man river, years beyond my maturity, or whatever else you want to call it.  However, I prefer to look at it a bit simplier.  I now have a right to make people listen to me.  I'm a true adult, no more funny talk, I'm all business now.
so now that i got you going about that hot teacher that you had the hots for, what if i kicked up the hotness factor of the story by mentioning to you, what if along with that first hot teacher was also a second hot teacher at the school! double the pleasure, double the fun! aren't you wishing you were back in high school now? how about we take these two teachers and put them together in an empty classroom? ooof, i can barely look straight now, forget about typing!
We get back to the ship and find that Dad is feeling somewhat better, and he joins us for dinner. Our next stop will be Cozumel, and Felix, our waiter, recommended stopping off at Carlos'n Charlie's, the local party bar. He told us that generally, by 3:00 PM or so, the girls start losing their tops, and the party continues on. He told us that the free tequila flows most of the day. Well, that was enough for us! We scatter, and meet again at Dizzy's for a little more jazz, and a final nightcap. Little did we know that the shit was once again going to hit the fan in the morning...
The Pokéwalker is Pokemon Soul Silver and Heart Gold's gimmick; a pedometer that records your steps and allows you to build up your pokémon, capture additional pokémon and find items.Over at Bulbapedia they've determined that to unlock everything the Pokéwalker has to offer, it's going to take 1,000 miles of walking. Who needs to do that, when you can flat out cheat instead?After some closed-laboratory experiments in my apartment and some field tests, we've determined some effective ways to trick the Pokéwalker into thinking you've been walking:

"The Mis-Education of the Negro", by Carter G. Woodson.
This is going to be a great book and will make for a great topic of discussion in our next meeting. In my opinion this is a must read for all African Americans. It will bring insight into a lot of issues that plight us as a people. And what you will find even more interesting is that this book was published in 1933 but still incredibly relevant to the problems we face today almost 80 years later.
So shall I be river letting you flow through brook; like the lines of this poem, I let you paint the sky as blue or the streets of a certain town lazy while there in a brothel, a girl brothel, a girl without the keys of her self allows you the street you make a tone darker.
We bought our Lexus RX 300 here many years ago and then traded it in for the Lexus RX 330 which I now drive.  Each and every time I have gone back to the dealership for service, they have been amazing.  They are fast.  They are efficient.  They drive me to my office at no cost and then reimburse the cost of a cab when I come back.

At the dealership they have a cafe with reading chairs, flat screens etc. And to top it all off, they give free car washes to their customers.
My wife and I were thrilled that a few friends recommended we try out Coast. Easily accessible from 90/94, there was no corkage fee for the bottle of wine we brought in and the sushi was excellent. Highly recommend the Sunshine and Volcano rolls in addition to the Hamachi/Jalapeno. Also a huge fan of their spicy miso soup and spinach appetizers. We're going to make this at least a biweekly outing.
Sebastian has Down Syndrome and requires more attention than most babies. Among other things, he has to be fed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, even through the night. Mindy knew his parents could use a break. So she volunteered to hold him for a while. She sang him to sleep. Mindy would be the first to tell you it's a God thing. Yep! I think it's just beautiful! And so does little Sebastian!
Am I the only one who finds Atwood's writing the equivalent of a Sunday roast? Eagerly awaited and elegantly presented, you know that no matter which bit of the chicken you choose, you will always be satisfied. And any puns involving her novel 'The Edible Woman' are verboten. The roast potatoes will be crunchy, the greens will be soft and the Yorkshire puddings will be well cooked. Margaret is to me the epitome of a family gathering. I crave her writing style in the same way I crave my wife's roast dinners.
Experience tells me we need to take this, hopefully temporary, yard art to an appropriate specialist. In this case, that would be an auto-electric shop. Experience has also taught me the damn thing needs to be running for them to do a diagnosis on it. I’ve been down that particular primrose path before. Without their equipment, they have to examine the entire electrical system, a very expensive process, and hope like hell they get lucky. If they don’t get lucky, Repair by Replacement goes into operation – another very expensive process. Two expensive processes do not equal an affordable bill.
Yet, after speaking of God’s intimate knowledge- he asks him to search him. He asks him to see things we normally want to hide from the Almighty- anxious thoughts, offensive ways. Yet, the psalmist knows what we all know- we cannot hide from God. So if we can’t hide from Him, then we should ask His help to overcome our faults and weaknesses.
At nearly 19 feet long and dripping with what seems like 500 pounds of chrome, the Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum is the biggest, glitziest, most conspicuously consumptive vehicle in General Motors’ lineup. The stretched ESV variant is almost 20 inches longer than the regular Escalade, with the range-topping Platinum package (available on both lengths) adding a new CTS-inspired grille and front fascia, along with super-bright LED headlights and unique 22-inch wheels.
I am not the typical RPG gamer. I have never been a fan of the games where you pick your actions from a menu. This is a real-time RPG. It is wide open from the begining, although one might want to watch where they venture. High-level nasties, and locked doors may block your way. If you are a mage, dispatching the baddies will come easier. If you are a theif, you can take care of those pesky locks with ease. But, your class is not limited.
I used to watch Dr. Who on PBS with my dad in the eighties.  I am not into sci-fi at all.  My dad is a Trekkie and into the Who series deeply.  Out of all his interests, I shared in Dr. Who simply because it was a series I could follow because it centered around time travel.  Time involves most of what we do so it was practical in a sense.  We have wondered about the validity of the past, the future and how we apply the present.   Dr. Who's cast involved real people who were relatable.  In the area I live now, I was quite disappointed to find the local PBS doesnt air Dr. Who.
I paid 100 bucks for this shirt. However, I'm now able to wear this thing to formal functions, instead of a suit and a tie. Can you believe it? I can wear this to the symphony. I can wear this to weddings-I did today. I have to say that I have procrastinated in making what has become an obligatory purchase.
We are still waiting to hear more details about the ATM crooks. One thing that has the town abuzz is that the news reported on Wednesday that they had confessions from four more guys, three of whom are 18. For some reason, the news has since blacked out and none of the three names have been made public.
Alex Chilton died today from a heart attack. For those of you who don't know who he was, he was one of the primary members of Big Star, a band I fell in love with only fairly recently. He wrote some of the most modern-sounding music from the early 70's, unfortunately, Big Star wasn't as large a commercial success as they deserved to be, releasing only three albums before a long break from recording as a band. It didn't help that their recording company didn't give them a fair break either.
The big star of today's Apple event in San Francisco had to be the latest version of the iPod Nano. Chief amongst the music player's new features is a video camera placed on the bottom rear of the device.After the presentation, out editor-in-chief Lance Ulanoff managed to get some hands-on time with the new device on the show room floor. Check out some more exclusive images of the new iPod Nano after the jump.
Alright. In order to finally complete my application, I tried another photo on istockphoto.com. This time it's from the food and beverage category. Which is a wanted category of photographs as described in their tutorial or Photo Training Manual. If that pic doesn't fly, I guess I need new camera equipment. As you probably guessed by now, my approach to istockphoto is this. "Dude, you take thousands and thousands of photos every year, there must be some stock-worthy stuff in there."
The is a reviewer favorite, and the iPhone 3GS (the S stands for speed) receives accolades as well, although reviewers aren't quite as enthusiastic. Available and 32 GB  versions, the 3GS boasts an upgraded 600 MHz processor (up from 412 MHz) and 256 MB of RAM, double that of the iPhone 3G's 128 MB. Testing by editors at MobileTechReview.com, PCMag.com and others shows that the 3GS is indeed noticeably faster in loading contacts, email, websites, games and various apps. Other than circuitry upgrades, most of the improvements to the iPhone 3GS are software-based, and many reviewers point out that current iPhone 3G owners can simply download the iPhone 3.0 software for free. Nearly every reviewer recommends buying the new iPhone only if you have the original iPhone or haven't yet taken the iPhone plunge.
The Lounge (left) gives your iPhone 3GS or 3G a place to recline, whether on your desktop or on a dashboard, so you can easily view the screen. Its main use is with GPS applications, but it's also handy when you want to watch a video. It lists for $49.99.
So, because of my last post, My wife finished both Gary Unmarried and the first season of Frasier with me last night. Enjoyed Gary Unmarried immensely. Frasier is very on again/off again for me. Some are hilarious, some are funny, and some are a waste of 22 minutes. The season ender for me was in the final category. It was nothing like the rest of the show, and for me was a failed experiment.
The 2010 Winter Olympics games are about to begin in Vancouver, Canada, and while it isn't the first Olympics since the App Store launched (it was a month old for the 2008 Summer Games), it will be the first to receive massive support from the iPhone community. From tracking the winners, to virtual recreations of the events to apps crafted just for the athletes, the App Store has plenty to offer, and these are some of the best:
I am hoping against hope that President Obama (I can't remember when I have to capitalize "president") can be successful, and not just because I'm a Democrat. I am kind of tired to hear the same old opinions that the stimulus plan is too much spending, while at the same time not providing enough tax relief for the upper income brackets. Can't anyone acknowledge that supply-side economics didn't work?
Oh I may have a few co-workers with me and I know that I will always have plenty to do while at my destination necessitating my businessness (oh yeah, I just made that up), but when all is said and done, the bed just isn't as warm without my wife next to me and my child relatively close.
Arrested Development is undoubtedly the best sitcom of the 21st Century, and it never even got a chance to win the hearts of America. This show had a wonderful blend of topical humor and dry wit. In its three seasons - from the pilot, which was extended and became the first episode, to the epilogue in the third season - Arrested Development delivered continuous laughs.
precious the movie is a part 3 of a series that is dedicated to the Faces of Domestic Violence. In part 1 of this series I began telling my friends Sara's story that ivolved  emotional and verbal abuse that began with Eli's mother who yelled and Screamed at Eli and his Dad. Eventually this domestic abuse began its vicious cycle and transitioned from Eli be abused by his mom to Eli abuing Sara, his wife.
As days go, it doesn’t seem like a bad day. The sun is casting a golden glow on the branches of the cedar and spruce trees in the front yard. Other than a couple of drifts created by shovel and blower, the snow has retreated to a few spots that will be shaded by trees for another few weeks. The temperature is balmy enough to make T-shirts a viable alternative to coats. Like I said, as days go, it doesn’t seem bad.
FROM MTV.COM: "Twilight" stars Robert Pattinson and Peter Facinelli have told MTV News that their ideal director for "Breaking Dawn," the still-announced adaptation of the final volume in the vampire series, would be two-time Oscar-nominated director Gus Van Sant. An Entertainment Weekly report on Tuesday suggested that Van Sant ("Milk") is in fact one of three high-profile directors who have been approached to helm the film, along with Sofia Coppola ("Lost in Translation") and Bill Condon ("Dreamgirls").
The way Morgan searched for the right BMW was spiritual. Finding a 2002 for two thousand two (hundred. It has connection to his mother's memory so when we drove to pick it up in Monterey we also visited an artist friend of hers from High School (Neutrer.) At the reunion Julia reminded everyone (of how prolific Jayne was) by the impressive style of dark outlines of playful imagry and we sat at the same table as Josh Reynolds so we could share Trident stories . . in Chicago!
The next optimization technique, I will be demonstrating is a predicate pushing problem.  Unbeknownst to most developers, SQL Server 2005 does have a problem with predicate pushing in views.  A lot of these issues have been resolved in SQL Server 2008, but should be known.  I will be demonstrating a very simple example, using a ranking function.  Ranking functions are relatively new to SQL Server and were introduced in 2005.  I am sure there are other scenarios that cause predicate pushing problems, but I will only be addressing the ranking problem, in this post.s
Most of Sunbelt Software's business lies in supplying malware protection to its 25,000 Enterprise customers. Sunbelt also licenses its engine and sandbox analysis software to other vendors. But the people at Sunbelt are just as passionate about their consumer product, VIPRE Antivirus 4.0 ($29.95 direct). VIPRE did well in testing, and it offers some bonus features more often found in suites than in standalone antivirus utilities.
This stuff is great; I found it through a friend and well never take aspirin again. Not only is hyland a great company, the products that they offer are budget conscious and effective. It is not necessarily a great head ache cure but it does sooth my daily aches, when necessary.
In Homo Sapiens sapiens, that's certainly the case: men try to hoard women, preventing other men from getting access to them, and the morality of "rape" is more about keeping women secure and intact from other males than about respecting women's wishes or decisions. I've been annoyed, in the "evolutionary" discussions of rape I've seen so far, by their careful avoidance of the fact that in the real world, rape is not considered such a bad thing after all, that women are presumed be wanting it secretly, and that men are constantly trying to construct scenarios in which a woman forfeits her right to say No.
As one of the freshest and most interesting videogame franchises today, BioShock is 100% definitely going to get ruined by 2K. BioShock is loved for its amazing setting that will soon be stripped of all mystique and thought-provoking story and continually ret-conned into sterility. Who can forget their first moment they ran into a Big Daddy, a videogame character who will be marketed until you can't remember why you liked him in the first place?Soon BioShock will too join the ranks of innovative franchises such as Splinter Cell and Guitar Hero which are now unbearable to even look at. Here's now:
I was born in sathanur and bought in villupuram & chennai , I lived there for nearly quaterhalf my life before emigrating to the UK in 2010. Much of that time was spent at R.V.M.H.S School and SRM Valliamai Engg College; Originally an Electrical Engineer, I’ve spent most of my adult life working in that strange places where meets technology, for a number of very large firms. I’m passionate about the things that interest me. My family, My Lovely temple (Triuvanamalai) , community & My Friends( Subesh,Raghul) . A retarded hippie at heart, I listen primarily to music made in the rock,melodies,carnatic(whatever sound nice to me).. I’m passionate about my profession(s), both planned and accidental. More and more my interests have moved towards education, therefore in uk for my higher education M.Sc ( electronics and information technology)....
To find classic car insurance quotes you should use the internet. This helps to speed things up quite a bit. In other words, you don't have to sit back and wait for an agent or broker to call you back. Instead, you are in charge and taking the initiative. How does that sound to you?
Way back in the 1990s I was at Supercuts one day and the tweeker girl doing my buzz cut became fascinated with my Irish heritage and how that related to my sparse-but-there body hair. Are you Irish? she asked. I'm not from Ireland, I replied, but my ancestors were.
Not sure where to start on this one, It moved me and brought me to tears. This young girl, Precious Jones, It starts off with her a 16 year old girl. She has no education, and is very overweight. Wannabe father molesting her, Her mother is a worthless abusive figure in her life that resents her for the father molesting her, and her bearing children of his. Precious is abused and discarded thru her life at home, brought me to tears the things her mother said to her. I can see why Monique won the Oscar, ( she played the mother) It had to been a hard role to act.
I spent a lot of time last week cogitating about the topic for my next blog. The ideas that crossed my mind ranged from the mirthful experiences in my college (in continuation of my first blog) to the heavy ones like ‘Hindutva’. I also thought of writing about my blissful life in school but later decided against it. As I sat down to write about anything which inaugurates my thought process, a much uncomplicated idea came to my mind about the most cherubic and audacious (arguably) person on this heavenly planet. Yes, I am going to write few things about my angelic Mother (though in a slap-stick way!!). Well I am not going to discourse the love that is shared in the mother-child relationship (for that you can always listen to the famous song from Taare Zameen Par). What I am going to talk about here are rules that every mother sets in her house to keep a check on people living under her domain (well in my case, this kingdom consists of me, my brother and dad too!!).


If you are a girl and are reading this, chances are you would not agree. But read on and I am sure you would be convinced.
Then I went out a bought a new truck that had XM built in. At first I missed being able to see the name of the artist and the song at the same time, and I missed not being able to set it to tune to certain songs or artists that I liked to hear more than others...but I got over it!
Lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its ThinkPad and IdeaPad lines. But a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. In addition to getting new Intel parts, the Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3 ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the Editors' Choice Toshiba mini NB305-N410 ($400.00 Direct, ) and the HP Mini 5102 ($400 Direct, ). Unfortunately, while the Toshiba NB305 and HP 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the S10-3's one-piece touchpad does the opposite.
Recently, I was frustrated while trying to package a Java keystore file from my Maven project to a project archive (tar or zip) using assembly.xml. Somehow, when I used the command: keytool -keystore cacerts -list on the certificate keystore inside the tar/zip archive, it would just say that the keystore is invalid. After some search, I found that there is a little setting in the pom.xml which instructs maven not to do any filtering tasks on the files you specify when you execute a maven command.
1. No ice… If your ice maker has stopped making ice then you need to check these things.
         1. The lever that controls the ice maker has been pushed up which turns it off. If you have a red lever, pull it down to the wire and if you just have a wire then just pull down the wire to start your ice maker up.
         2. Make sure the freezer temperature is below 10 degrees F If the freezer is too warm ice production will be poor because the ice maker will not cycle properly.
         3. The ice maker fill tube may have ice formed in it, blocking it. Use a hair dryer to melt the ice. Watch out for the plastic parts, so that you do not melt the plastic. Also check the water inlet valve and the shut off valve, to make sure it is not plugged with debris. The openings in those valves are very small.
         4. Check the gears in the ice makers to see if they are broken or stripped. Also look to see if the ice rake is broken. All parts in the ice maker are replaceable individually, If you find broken parts replace them.
Whenever I feel the urge to play the older games, I always whip out Super Mario Bros.3 for the regular Nintendo. It is always fun. These games are the originals. I love playing any Super Mario game no matter for what console.
Yesterday Chief Ican went out to visit Mrs. Westup. He wanted to see the miracle appliances for himself. Amila was happy to see him and to be given the chance to show off the wonderful things that had come into her life. He had her retell him how she got up and found everything there . She hadn’t been awaken by any noise during the night. Chief Ican thought that was really weird since when they put the new hot water heater in the jail half the town could hear the racket the plumber made.
I traded in my 2003 Ultra Classic (42,000 miles) in August on a new 2009 Ultra Classic. The dealership I bought from was making deals too good to refuse. They even beat a different dealers offer, on a 2008 model no less, by $3000 ! Mine is the new for 2009 Flame Blue Pearl color. It has  turquoise pin-striping as well. So far, having ridden about 2,500 miles, and in 2 other states, I am LOVING it ! It rides smoother and firmer than the "03 did. I attribute this to the new,wider rear tire/wheel.
It must have been torture for South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as all the Tiger Woods events unfolded while they were on hiatus.When you dangle raw meat above a cage of wolves (or tigers), they tend to get hungrier and a lot more rabid - and in Trey and Matt's case - a lot more creative.Finally, we get to see what must have been brewing in their deeply disturbed minds all these months with the season fourteen premiere entitled "Sexual Healing."
Sorry, Schwim-Fans, but Ross Gellar is off the market.As reported by US Magazine, David Schwimmer (43) will soon tie the knot with his girlfriend of three years, Zoe Buckman (24). And yes, your math is correct: Daddy Schwimmer took her to get her first legal drink.Actually, that’s not entirely accurate, as the lucky couple (it’s the first marriage for both) met in England on the set of Schwimmer’s successful comedy Run Fatboy Run. And just to be clear, by “successful,” I mean, “only comedy that’s successfully made Simon Pegg not funny.” So that means Buckman has possibly been drunk since she was eighteen, which may explain her taste in men.
So happy with it, got it 5 days ago... and more than happy, WiFi, watchin movies, the sound, everything more than cool!
I've always been a gadget fiend, having bought dozens of digital cameras, mp3 players, handheld GPS devices, and cell phones .. now all in one.
My favorite things

    * design - so clean, plus love the touch screen
    * google maps - more than a map, also shows you bus/train options and travel time
    * google voice search - much easier to say a few words than to type them
    * safari - full on web browser, fast when on wifi
    * mp3 player - love my 32gb and sync with iTunes playlists
    * all the apps - games, productivity
    * and Specific to 3GS - way faster than 2G, and compass makes some apps better, like google maps
It's really difficult to settle on any one aspect of this episode that I'm the most excited about.  I was serious when I noted two weeks ago that Chuck offers more plot progression and character development than any 5 episodes of Lost, and "Chuck Vs. The Tic-Tac" offered that, and so much more.It takes guts to remove the fangs of any series' most bad-ass character, but all our base are belong to Adam Baldwin for handling the birth of, defection and (figurative) death of John Casey with such believable dramatic weight.
In case you don't already know, last night I won "Puckett's Rising Star" competition.  This was a contest held at Puckett's Grocery in Franklin among Nashville songwriters judging on song quality and performance.   The contest had three rounds; 8 seperate opening rounds, a semifinal round of sixteen, and a final round of four writers.  (about 120 writers total)
I was born in 1946 and lived outside of Mitchell, South Dakota by the James River I did a lot of hunting, fishing and trapping. There was a rock dam on the river where at one time stood a flour mill. I would spear carp and sell them to a nearby mink farm where they where used as mink food. I went to Riverside grade school, a one-roomed country school house ….then I went to Mitchell Senior High.
Try as I might I just cant seem to get you off my mind. You’re so much better than any other I could hope to find. No need to be kind I can see you’ve made up your mind. You’ve been nothing but an absentee to me, but I know I don’t want to be free from your grasp. Slippery as it may be.
My across the street neighbor has a two-year old chocolate lab, which turns out to have had serious knee problems in her back legs. (Actually, they are called hocks, but the right word only gets in the way here.)
As much as I liked - but didn't necessarily love - Avatar, I absolutely got that it was a big-screen, 3D, IMAX experience, meant to be enjoyed in an immense theater, filled with the latest in cinematic technology and surrounded by fans as emotionally connected to the material as yourself. It was the kind of movie that simply wouldn't be as engaging at home, no matter how high the definition in which you watched it...Or how large your television...Or how great your sound system...
Rather than a straight adaptation of Carroll’s stories, Woolverton has chosen to stage her story 13 years after the events in the books, which essentially makes this film a sequel of sorts; its closest cousin in this arena is another Disney-sanctioned reworking of classic children’s literature, Walter Murch’s Return to Oz (1985), an extremely dark and violent product of the Reagan era that has virtually nothing to do with Victor Fleming’s candy-colored musical. As Dorothy did in that film, Alice returns to Wonderland years later, only to find it enmeshed in conflict and alarm. Both films reunite their young heroines with an array of weird and endearing characters, and interestingly both also feature queens who are obsessed with decapitation (in Return to Oz, the evil queen keeps a closet of assorted heads to “wear,” whereas in Alice in Wonderland Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen just likes to cut them off).
The turning point of the game came in the fourth quarter when Clint Sessions picked off Joe Flacco and returned it for a touchdown. And if that wasn't enough, Robert Mathis stripped Flacco on the next play and the Colts recovered.
As I drift in and out, I can only hope that you are doing the same. Somewhere else wherever you may lay I hope you dream of delightful days with you and I. Dream of me as I dream of you, Dream of me as only you can see. Dream of me as I dream of me. Dream, just let yourself go ahead and dream...Your all I really care about. And there is no doubt that I'd wait forever and a day until your ready to be with me…
Have you ever craved an ever-evolving, dynamic music library within the confines of your portable music player?  Did you ever hear a song on the radio...and then wish you could record it on the spot...even if the song was almost finished?  Do you ever get bored with choices of your stale music collection on your IPOD...and wish you had a better source for finding new music, that just isn't being played on the FM dial?
Guinness is another beer with a pseudo cult following.  There are people that love the stuff so much they buy hats and shirts to let you know they like Guinness.  Guinness represent something of a different take on beer than most people are use to. It is dark and looks different. I guess people respond to that sort of anti-yellow beer sort of thing. I remember in my younger light beer drinking days I pretty much thought Guinness was a horrible joke. Why would anyone drink something that dark and heavy?
I have just finished reading no exit by William Garvin, out now from Harry Godwin's Arthur Shilling Press. Garvin's poems are 'science fiction', but more than that they feel as though they're constellated from the debris or rather the 'glitter trails' of 'science fiction'. So the first poem begins 'strugatsky sequence. diary]' and there's a beautiful short poem called 'Tarkovsky', in which the words are printed so close to the edge of the page it's tempting to believe in something missing, some clue that makes the poem less strange and haunting.
Where am I? Middle of no where? Where is coffee shop? Oh... no GPS… First day, we spent all the day in a 15 passenger van.
Second day, we only prepare things, such as we went to Wal-mart for foods, pray and get some tools ready for the school.
We brought 363 dollars food. Thanks for the campus ministry taxes free sponsor. I was impressed how Abbey Novak got everything ready by her own, especially meals for all of us and for all the kids who are invited to come.
LAS VEGAS—Polaroid fans will be pleased with the company's new product line-up announced Wednesday at CES, which marks the long-awaited return of classic Polaroid instant film, along with a modern version of the OneStep instant film camera. In addition, the company launched new instant ZINK ("zero-ink") digital products, including a camera and a printer. The company also showed off its new photo-sharing site, The Polaroid Gallery.Polaroid will offer a modern version of the Polaroid OneStep camera, the PIC 1000, available in a range of colors and based on the classic Polaroid Color 600 Instant Film to produce the iconic instant pictures with white borders.
I guess there's not too much to say. There never really is. I'm stuck in an odd "other" realm where I have no time to invest in things that would further my own personal happiness but I have all the time in the world to sit and wish I was doing something else. I guess I'm spoiled, at least a little.

After looking at my last credit card bill, yikes, I picked up freelance writing to fill the cracks my paycheck doesn't want to cover and, for the most part, it's working well.
Gutter is a new magazine of 'New Scottish Writing.' I am delighted that I have a poem in their first issue. There are lots and lots of good things in the beautifully designed magazine, so go and subscribe please, here. It is very reasonably priced.
Sony announced the release date today for ModNation Racers: May 25. If you're wondering whether that goes for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Portable version, the answer is "both." As previously reported, the title is set to launch on both platforms, simultaneously, and with similar feature sets. The title is carrying the torch of Little Big Planet's "Play, Create, Share" model, with the ability to create and share custom tracks.The blog also outlined the pre-order incentives for the game, which vary according to retailer. Each of the "Modded," Mighty-Mugg-style racers hails from a well-known Sony franchise (above). GameStop pre-orders will receive Kratos and his "Kart of Chaos."
I have been toying over the idea of creating a separate blog for my technical wanderings for some time now. Earlier, I had posted some technical posts on my main blog - www.abhishekontheweb.com, but, now, those seem out of place in a blog, which deals with more general stuff, like events, photography, articles (and whatever random thought comes in my mind). As, in the last few years, I have been working on various technologies, especially Java based, I thought of writing about some of the technical ideas that I have been influenced by, technical issues I have been intrigued by, and the upcoming technologies that I am working on. And what better place than to have a new blog just for that.

I would like to put in as much details as possible in my post, else this blog would defeat its purpose.
Ok Fellas, hopefully all the stragglers have caught up and finished the first book by now!
We have confirmed that we will have our first meeting Saturday 12/12/09.
Do us all a favor and don't show up not knowing what the Whole book is about because you didn't finish it. You might get voted off the Island...

The most hyped game of the year. The rivalry of the decade. Two of the all time best quarterbacks. Home field advantage on the line. There was no way the game could live up to the hype surrounding it leading up to Sunday night. They didn't hype it enough. In what will go down as an instant classic in this now historic rivalry, the Indianapolis Colts came from 17 down in the fourth quarter to steal a win from the New England Patriots, 35-34.
I'm a sucker for bowling alleys. Maybe because Bowling Alone is one my favorite books. Maybe because Ed (Wikipedia entry or IMDB) is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Maybe because I love the Independence Square. Or maybe because Michelle, the manager is awesome. Maybe because the great Paula Sorensen works there when she isn't at the Main Street Coffee Shop and/or singing great songs.
52 Photowalks - I read about this project idea over here. The goal is to get out of the house once a week and walk around snapping photos. I'm hoping to do "themes" or "areas" for these walks and I have a list of ideas that I'm excited about - the difficulty will be finding time. My goal is to do almost all of these walks in the Philadelphia area so at the end of the year, I'll have covered a decent amount of the city and surrounding area. I've posted my first one over here although I haven't decided on a format for these yet. More to come later.
I never really did fit into the Italian schedule of things here. I usually did my sightseeing during chuisora, Italian siesta time. I headed to the beach typically when everyone else was leaving. I went out to dinner generally hours before everyone else. I visited Cagliari when it was literally empty. What can I say? I had to plan much of my biking around the heat of the day. The sun was too strong for me to sit exposed on the beach in the afternoon. And, I'm not Italian.
THe NFL Hall of Famer was one of the greatest defensive linesmen of our time when he played for the Los Angeles Rams as part of the 'fearsome foursome,' and then embarked on a successful television career.
Here's one comic-book adaptation I would dearly like to see - Wes Anderson's take on Spider-Man. It is a tale of love and photography, of responsibility and revenge; a film so arch it's practically humpbacked. For all that, The Amazing Spider-Man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears. Downplay those distracting crime-fighting elements and Peter Parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited. He is, in short, a very Andersonian antihero.
I took my spare DAB radio into work to listen to whilst I sort the stores out. And I had the misfortune to tune into Planet Rock. But, initially, I gave the station a chance to enlighten me for once. True to its' output, Planet Rock disappointed me immensely.
I can still remember hearing about Terrorist attacks against Westerners in Saudi Arabia while I was in boarding school and wondering if my parents and brother and sister were alright. Both my parents seemed to be vulnerable at different times to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was always such a relief to hear their voice after one of the attacks that got close.
Wii Sports Resort is the follow-up game to Wii sports - the original game that came with the Wii console. THe main differnece besides there are new games / activities is the fact that it incorporates the Wii Motion Plus Adapter. The adapter connects onto the bottom of the Wii mote where the nunchuk would plug into. The new adapter allows for greater sensitivity of the Wii mote, allowing the sensor bar and Wii to pick up more of the actual movoements of the person playing the game.
So, one weekend we were sitting on top of the jungle gym when Roger reached into his backpack and unveiled his most recent acquisition, the price tagger gun from his parents’ store. “This is the coolest thing in the world. I can stick a price on anything now,” he said, fiddling with the dial for a bit, then promptly tagging the jungle gym at 88 cents per can. “See? Now if anyone wants to buy this jungle gym, they have to pay us 88 cents!”
That is showing tremendous relative strength, as well as there is a buy signal with our two other indicators. We use Stochastic and On Balance Volume to confirm a move, and they both show buy signals. Place a stop loss order under $16.00 and our target for this company is $25.00
I really think the show would be better if they kept the boys and girls separate until the top two. A two-hour show at this point is impossible to sit through, even with the help of Tivo. Tonight's comments from the judges were pretty good for the most part. My comments, in order of appearance:Michael Lynch is by far the best of the guys and will make it to the top few (although DialIdol.com disagrees).Didi was better than expected again. She's not my choice by a long shot, but is safe for at least another 3 weeks.Casey was better this week, but I'm not sure how long he will last. His song choice was not right for him
Ok here we go. I am off the PIP next Friday. That is if I am still there. I found out in my 1:1 today that in addition to no more sick time, I have 7 hours personal time and 4 hours of vacation time. I am SCREWED!!! Per my Manager I wrote to HR to see what happens should I get sick. I think I already know corporate Americas answer but I will let them humor me. There has to be a law against this but IL being an at will state. So now I am not sure how much longer I will be working there. Sad part I actually liked this job. Starting to look now to leave on my own terms. Insurance is going to be fun as usual but we shall see and we will survive.
Did not win on Friday. In fact, only got one digit right. And another work week starts and it still counts what I do at work. As you can see I didn't "open the box" by playing those numbers. I guess I'm lucky! Let's see if 2010 brings some surprises. not much news. did not get struck by lightning (yay), did not win the lottery (yay, not). anyway...we'll try again
Most photographers would balk at spending $2K for a fixed-lens digital camera, but Leica has a large following, and the Leica X1 ($1,995 list) will find a happy home with many of the company's devotees. Like the Leica M8 ($5,995 list), the X1 features an APS-C image sensor—the same size sensor found in much larger digital SLR cameras, such as the Editors' Choice Canon EOS Rebel T1i ($899.99, )—capable of producing D-SLR-quality images. Though Leica priced the X1 at a fraction of the M8, image quality is still top notch. But when you compare it to cameras from other manufacturers, such as the Lumix DMC-GF1 ($899.99, ) from Panasonic, the X1 becomes much less attractive. Though you won't find a camera as small as the X1 with comparable image quality, you can spend far less on larger cameras that offer more features, comparable image quality, faster autofocus, no shutter lag, interchangeable lenses, higher resolution LCDs and HD video capture.
Our local public High School is pretty good. Nice facilities, gang & drug problems that are either non-existent or invisible, and motivated teachers. My wife and I stay pretty involved in our kids educations. One of the things we do, when able and required, is to go over their tests with them to see where things went astray.
If Arsenal get Inter in the next round expect 180 minutes of squeaky bum time with little action. My flat mate (the united fan) reckons Arsenal'll get Bordeaux or CSKA Moscow. Obviously I won't complain if we do but one thing's for sure: If Chelsea got through tonight they'd definitely have gotten one of those 2 in the quarters so let's all be grateful for that and keep our fingers crossed for a United-Barca match up. If we can avoid them enroute we can make the final.

Since Bendtner's late winner on Saturday against Hull the stat men have said that Arsenal officially score the most late goals (after 75 mins) in the Premier League. I think any Arsenal fan would probably know that to be true too. I was stood watching the Hull game in the pub and my girlfriend came in after work with about 10 minutes to go and asked if I'd be grumpy if we drew. We both knew the real answer but I said I wouldn't be. I was surrounded by grumpy gooners. That was until Bendtner scored and the place went absolutely ballistic and it felt fantastic. Dan, my other flatmate (the one without a club), was watching with us and as I looked around for him I noticed, what at first glance, appeared to be scuffle. In actual fact Dan had been mobbed in his celebrations by two Arsenal fans in their fifties. It was such a relief and the grin on Dan's face as we left the pub was amazing. He said he was thinking about supporting Arsenal and I told him that if he wanted to he was more than welcome but that disappointment is as much a necessity of being a gooner as faith in Arsene Wenger is. In truth I was dead chuffed.
In the spirit of newborns arrivals life has been a little less planned and a little more hectic. One might say we have currently it all under control, but those changes day-to-day or night-to-night. However, on the average we all are currently above water. 

Alex has been doing well though; gaining weight, growing, eating, and sleeping. 

Nathan is a sponge. He is learning everything and anything. The explosion of words, sentences and thoughts has really begun in full force. His imagination really has kicked in and he trains, planes, and cars have places to go.

As a parent, the little things are really the highlights: a middle of the night kiss on the forehead from Nathan while snuggling him back to sleep, a toothless grin from Alex while singing to him, measuring tape races with Nathan on the kitchen floor, Alex sleeping on your chest.
I enjoy occasionally going lingerie shopping with my lady, initially out of curiosity about why the heck they cost so much more than men's undergarments, but i soon developed a keen interest in finding the right lingerie for my wife, as a way to spice up my sex life. Finding the right lingerie can be tricky; one person's cosmetic lift may be another person's dysfigurement. It is therefore helpful that a married man should occasionally take time out to go shopping for lingerie with wife, for her comfort, his libido (and money), their bond.

The first step is to determine what shape her body is. is she a pear, a ruler or an apple? A pear is a figure that is curvy. It's larger in the hips than in the tummy and has a smaller top than bottom. "Pears" generally have large thighs and rears as well. A ruler is a figure that is fairly balanced with little curve. Most "rulers" are very slim women. An apple figure is one that is much larger in the chest than in the hips and thighs. A woman who is apple shaped usually has a bit thicker middle but slim, toned legs. So figure out which figure she has first in order to determine which lingerie style will flatter her body the most.

Once you've determined her shape, the next step is to explore the different styles of lingerie that work with it. You should have a good idea of what styles of lingerie you (you and your other half) are looking for before you go shopping with her. Also be sure to shop at a nice lingerie boutique for the greatest selection and quality.
And then they’d hang up on me all frustrated. Like I was the idiot. Like I’m running around town scratching the last digit off the phone number on the printed materials of hotels through the Phoenix metropolitan area. Some nerve I had, not taking their reservation over the phone for the hotel they didn’t call that I don’t work at.

It started happening so frequently that I thought about actually just taking the reservations and letting them fend for themselves. Hey, it’s not my fault they screwed up. But by the time I came to that resolution they stopped calling.

I also used to get calls for somebody whose nickname was “Golden Boy.” This would not have been nearly as confusing had his real first name not been Rich.

Hello?
What’s up Golden boy?
What?
Is this golden boy?
I don’t think so?
Is this Rich?
Yes.
Rich Gulden?
Oh. No.

My dad’s cell phone number used to be 1 off from the towel department at Bed Bath and Beyond. People called him on more than one occasion to get a conversation that went like this.
All of us have probably gone to school, or work with someone who is gay. We probably all got along well and probably still do. No harm came to us or anyone else around them due to their sexual preferences. We are fellow humans after all. The dislike that many exhibit towards them only starts once they make their sexual preferences public and for no good reason other than the fact that society, with its prejudices and ignorance teaches you to despise people inclined towards homosexuality
4:04 am, Los Angeles. I was just shaken awake by what I thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. I went down the hall to the reception desk at the Comfort Inn in Monterey Park and I looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, Did something just happen? Yes, he replied. That was an earthquake.
I went back to my room and called Braff Zackton who was already at work in Chicago. Braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that I just rode a 4.4 in the Greater Los Angeles Area at 4:04am. It seems no one else is alarmed but me! That is completely whack and a first for me.
The optimistic meaning of life is what we all search for. Isn't it? Always the beauty of something so complicated, is put into such simple words, Soul, Love, Life, Understanding, Acceptance. Everything is so much more, you cannot express it in such simple words. Everyday people die, and no one really recognizes, everyday people form and no one really recognizes it, and why? Because were to busy searching for happiness, were all working, to get somewhere, where we think success is. People strive off of happiness, or the idea of it. Its so hard to find, and often times people think they need to be rich and be very successful to be happy. That is completely irrelevant, happiness is inside of you, within you. When you are completely accepting of yourself, its when you can be happy by yourself, no help from others, to know that if everyone you know left you, you could still be happy at least a little, by yourself. I'm becoming happy again. Katie Day has helped me become happy again & I want to thank her for that. I just hope it last! I have learned that the people in your life the just wakes up one day and just leaves you behind and act like you dont mean anything to them and it really does make you feel so down in the dumbs you dont want to do anything! Eat, can't sleep or even get to the point where you dont even dream good, thats when you just get up and learn to face the fact that they never have two shits about you. Don't do what I have been doing, dont not eat, sleep, or even get to the point when you dont even want to do what you really enjoy. I ask you please! Dont do this! Just live you life like im learning to do again.
So this is it for another year - December 31st 2009. I don't want to spend for ever ranting on about how my year went....just a brief look back on some of the highs and lows.

2008 was a rough year. 2009 wasn't a whole lot better....but, it was better. I encountered similar problems in 2009 as I did in 2008, but felt that I dealt with them better. Kept some of the demons at bay. This is partly due to the medication I had been on, Effexor XR (antidepressant). After being depressed on and off since high school, I finally gave in and tried it. It helped a lot. I hope the black dog never returns but one must always remain cautious.

Sadly, 2009 was a year of confrontation. I don't consider myself to be a confrontational person but 2009 unfortunately had several war moments. Confrontation with Hannah, former student, confrontation with Elsa, my ex girlfriend and confrontation with Maree, my ex friend. I had made attempts to resolve these issues with scattered and limited success. No point going into them now, let God be the judge.
So, over the Thanksgiving holiday, when Number one son was home from JHU for the break -- and after we dragged him (and number two son) to the mall -- and got Number one a haircut (actually a trim) -- we wandered the mall as post-20th century consumer zombies are programmed to do. 

Hell, somebody has got to keep the economy going.  

Compulsively, I used the opportunity to inquire about my sons' ideas for Christmas and birthday presents.   Number one son is transitioning into real manhood and after mentioning Guitar Legend (a campus rage), asked for a folding chair for his room, new pillows (as the university linens package ones suck), and a vacuum cleaner.  Number two mentioned various Wii videogames that come out in February (sigh).

My number one wife tried to get some group enthusiasm for zipping off to the movie theatre to see Beowulf -- but despite the attraction of Angelina Jolie's frontal nudity (albeit "animated") -- we decided against what seemed to be an Old English pre-quel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre (well, not in Texas and without chainsaws).

So, upon passing by the Saturday Night Matinee store, we wandered in to seek out some DVDs to buy and watch at home.  This is exactly the behavior that consumer market researchers adore -- "the impulse buy."   Number one son found "Enemy at the Gates" -- a film about the confrontation of a German and Russian sniper during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942.
After a couple weeks on the Job I had become like my 60-68 year old parents, waking up at 5:45 am and going to bed before 9 pm. My social life had been condensed to a quick after work joint with a buddy followed quickly by bed time. This is how I know that life isn't too short. When your doing stuff like this, you often think it couldn't be any longer.

One weekend I had decided that it was time for Max to play. I had been working my butt of and I wanted to party. So, I left work early one Friday in order to catch a good nap before the evening in order to wrangle the necessary energy for later that night. When I got home everything seemed normal and I was able to quickly fall asleep on the sofa in front of the TV.

I was awoken later that evening by my dad. He asked me if I wanted to go for dinner with him because my mom wasn't feeling up to it due to some nausea and she had suggested we just go alone. By the time I had showered and gotten ready my mom's condition had taken a severe turn for the worse. She was lying in bed sweating profusely and complaining of pain in her stomach and back. Ten minutes later she was having trouble breathing and was very weak. Needless to say, we canceled our dinner and took her to the hospital. By the time we got to emergency with her she was mumbling, sweating, and could not walk, let alone later hold herself upright on a chair. I had to carry her through the emergency doors, too weak to even hold her arms by her side, allowing them to hang down toward the floor.
