My family of 4 went on a Carnival cruise in Oct '08. We cruised on Carnival Sensation. I had an 8 and 3 year old. Camp Carnival was AWESOME. The kids would get mad when I got them. There was so much for them to do that they never got bored. They have a great staff of very friendly people who take the time to get t know yorchild even if they are only with them for a few days. I would like to ass tat cruising is the best way to go for our family. We get all the food we want, shows, babysitting so the parents get some alone time, games, dancing, gambling...need I say more.
