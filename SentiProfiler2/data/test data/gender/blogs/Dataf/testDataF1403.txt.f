I have flown JetBlue many times and I have never had a bad experience.  I am a very frequent flyer, taking 100 or more domestic and international airlines trip a year, and I have flown most of the world's airlines, and I have to give JetBlue my personal award for being number one, the best. At least in coach.  I'm not saying that another airline's First Class or Business Class is not better (although I have flown afew where JetBlue's is superior to their premium service.  But in general I'm only comparing coach to coach, and the general day to day operations of the airline.
