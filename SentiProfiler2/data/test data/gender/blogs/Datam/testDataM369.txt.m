So, my youngest brother Sean challenged me to run in the Philadelphia Marathon in 2005. While I've played sports all of my life, I had never liked running. We did it, and I count it as my biggest athletic accomplishment to date. It's 2008, and I plan to run some 5ks's and MAYBE ultimately build back to a marathon, with a 3:30 goal. Follow me as I battle Crohn's disease and a busy schedule.
