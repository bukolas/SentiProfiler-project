I am so proud to be part of my good friend Paul Bradley's show, "Dreams."
He has worked his butt off and has assembled an amazing line up of incredibly talented folks!

I am honored to be playing the very colorful role of the Mother Hen of a Whorehouse, her name is simply "The Black Widow." She is kind of like "Annie's" Miss Hannigan meets "Missing Person's" Dale Bozzio. LOL ;)

Congrats to Paul Bradley & the cast of DREAMS as we showcase 30 minutes of his script tonight at the prestigious ASCAP Disney Workshop.

WISH US LUCK!
