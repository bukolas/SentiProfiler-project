while many teachers do not think about their high school days whilst teaching their students. I find myself constantly looking back at that 2 years of my life and wonder just what did I do? How did I feel at that time? Did the same thing happen to me? What are those students thinking? Can I get a clue from what I went through? I always end up feeling that somehow, i missed some experiences I should have had.

I look into their earnest faces, their artlessness, their simpleness and I wonder if I still had that intact when I was their age. I doubt it. I’m not saying they are angels. but their calculations, strategies are so transparent I always want to ask them who they are trying to fool. Except that it is just too amusing.

I’ve always felt that that 2 years of my life was pretty much wasted. beside the fact that I made a few friends I would keep for life, joined the drama club and made precious memories of becoming someone I just wasn’t, and breaking out of my shell while in character… i was always too self conscious to really enjoy school. too… negative… too… non-chalent… too cynical… too fatalistic. I never valued the activities there were. Even now, I probably think sports day was lame, national day with a march pass was lame… boys were lame…

I always felt that entering NUS was a kind of liberation from jc.

Upon reflection, i think some of the factors that acted as barriers were
1) the fear that I would not enter university after screwing my ‘O’s and entering CJC. I have to say that i had never (and probably will never) study as hard and memorise as many facts as I did for my ‘A’s. I studied and forgot about the experience
2) lack of confidence. i assumed i was invisible and thus became invisible
3) the idea that many of the things we had to do was lame (besides watching plays and studying literature)
4) the idea that many things didn’t matter in the larger scheme of life. I forgot how experiences could and will shape a person
5) the lack of interest in almost everything
6) the lack of many familiar faces around me

i look at my students and find myself wishing i could go back to the time when I was 17. the time when I didn’t know better, the age of wide-eyed innocence.

Alas, the best we can do is to live in the present and live to the fullest to avoid making the same mistake. Carpe Diem.
