I absolutely love it! It is waaaaaay better than the chi that I have been using for 3 years. I have damaged, frizzy, split-end galore, very thick hair. Also being that I live right by the beach my hair is always frizzing up. It usually takes me about an hour and so few minutes to straighten my hair with my chi. With the Solia (1-3/4") it took me 20 minutes. I was amazed with the very BIG time difference. This will very much benefit my husband as he is always hurrying me up when I'm doing my hair. It didn't snag my hair once & did NOT frizz up when I stepped outside. Now I feel i got ripped off when I bought the chi. This was very well worth every cent.
