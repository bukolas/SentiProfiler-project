And all I can say is Thank You, Thank You!!!  
We thought we were looking at having another surgical procedure yesterday, so the boy got doped up before we saw the surgeon and he said "Nope, let's just wait a bit longer and see what happens.  It's healing so nicely I just don't want to cut him again"  Relief all around!!  So, we came home and set up his new computer, cleaned his room, I cleaned mine, sprayed bleach all over the tub - again, and I finally got all the laundry caught up.

I was standing over him as he was doing something on the computer and he looked up at me and I said "Do you know how much I love you?"  and he said "A lot, I know Mom.  I love you too."


This month's Tip-In Swap on BAJ was about Love - what kind of love makes your heart go all warm and fuzzy.  Mine is about Mother Love and it will go out in the mail tomorrow to Stacy  Here is what it looks like...
This is the story behind it is - I was at an estate sale a few weeks back and I saw this lonely little, beat up quilt hanging over the railing in the attic.  I picked it up and thought how sweet - it had little Sun Bonnet Sue's all over.  It was only $1 and I was debating - do I really need another thing to add to my collection of "junk"?  This woman was watching me and she said "That was well loved, wasn't it?"  I agreed and that was it - it came home with me.  As I was paying I saw this old office name plate for a desk, with the name of the woman who's things they were selling.  Turns out she is a lady who once attended my church.  She is now in an assisted-living home as she is almost ninety and very frail.  Next time I see her daughter I will let her know that I bought the quilt that was most likely hers and I am including it in my art - so it will live on in a variety of ways :-))


All for today my lovelies...
