Air Force career

Owen served in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), commencing in 1984, and rising to the rank of Air Commodore and Deputy Commander of the Australian Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Owen's career in the RAAF consisted of him holding various ranks and positions including:[2]

    1984 Flight Commander, No 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit
    1985 Three year exchange with USAF - responsible for Counter Air Tactics and Joint Battle Management courses at Tyndall AFB, completed abbreviated AWACS conversion
    1990 Completed RAAF Command and Staff College
    1992 Commander No 2 Control and Reporting Unit in Darwin
    1995 Chief of Staff - Air Defence 41 Wing HQ
    1998 Joint Air Plans, Strategic Command Division
    1999 Director of Joint Plans
    2000 Commander Surveillance and Control Group at RAAF Williamtown
    2005 Commander Surveillance and Response Group

In 1978, Owen moved to Williamtown - the site of a large RAAF military base and has lived in the region, when not on active duty, for 15 years.[3][4] He completed a Masters in Strategic Studies (MSS) in 1999 and resigned from the Air Force and the Australian Defence Force in 2009 and became Chief Exeuctive Officer of CI Agent Solutions,[1] a company that provides oil-spill solutions to the defence and aerospace industry sector.

He is married to Charlotte and they live in Newcastle with three adult sons.
Political career

In October 2010 Owen joined the Liberal Party and on 11 December 2010 was endorsed as the party's candidate for Newcastle at the 2011 state election.[4] Whilst it was widely reported[5] that Labor's chances were running low in the historically safe seat it was expected[6] that the Lord Mayor of Newcastle, John Tate who was running as an independent candidate, was most likely to defeat Jodi McKay, the incumbent Labor member and Minister. Bookies had Owen placed at odds of $5.25 for a win, as an outside chance.[6]

Leaked Labor Party internal polling on the eve of the election showed that Owen and the Liberal Party were well placed to defeat McKay and Tate. The polling showed Owen's primary support at 30 per cent; McKay (Labor) was at 25 per cent; and Tate's vote had "collapsed" to 16 per cent.[7] At the election, Owen achieved a swing of 26.9% and won the seat with 52.6% of the vote on a two party preferred basis.[3]

McKay conceded in a statement to the press that: "The people have had their say... I accept the decision of the Newcastle community that they do not want me to continue in this role."[8] The seat of Newcastle had been held by the Labor Party for its 84 years of existence as a single member electorate, except being held by an independent between 1988 and 1991.[3]
Honours and awards

Owen became a Member of the Order of Australia (Military Division) (AM) on 26 January 2007.[9] He received the Australian Active Service Medal and the Iraq and Afghanistan campaign medals in 2009.[1]
