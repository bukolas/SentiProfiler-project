In real life, Alice struggles with the burdens of impending adulthood, seemingly unable to fit in with the standards of society. Moments after being proposed to, Alice falls back through the rabbit hole. 

It is prophesied that, in order to defeat the Red Queen, Alice will side with the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and kill the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee).

However, there is doubt over whether Alice is the "real" Alice. The White Rabbit doesn't believe she is, while the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) wholeheartedly believes Alice is indeed the "real" Alice.
