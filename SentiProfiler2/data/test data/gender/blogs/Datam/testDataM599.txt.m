If u see dasavataram in each and every frame kamal will be there dominating the scene which is unlike his movies where he gives his co-actors are  also given a chance to dominate like in  Anbe Sivam,Virumandi and much of his movies.But in dasavataram it was purely Kamal and no one else though Asin was there she didn't do a great deal.And it paid out for Kamal.Dasavatharam is the biggest blockbuster of the year and the only blockbuster in Kollywood. When we come to Rajini he used to be in every frame of the movie and his fans and all other people would love him for his punch dialogues,style and fight sequences.But when you take Kuselan Pasupathi would be in every frame of the movie and Rajini would have dominated the climax where he makes everyone cry.Padayappa is a rare exception but in that movie also he was there full length while in Kuselan he was there only for 55 mins and in Chandramukhi Jyothika dominated only the last 20 mins other parts it was full of Rajini. But unfortunately it didn't pay off for rajini as Kuselan ws one of the major flops of the year along with Bheema and Kuruvi.And Rajini is asked to pay the debts for the loss occued which is really sad because when his film were huge hit no one came and and give him the share he is eligible for but when it is a flop he is asked to pay the debts.  Only one thing is clear from this .For a masala actor it is difficult to give a hit if he doesn't dominate whereas for an actor who gives his co-actors  a chance the people like it any way he acts if the film is good.
