I have been touched by so many of your comments and everything that you have shared with me via email. It seems like there is a real need for people to share their school lunch experiences: the good, the bad, and the ugly. In the spirit of sharing and continuing the dialogue about school lunches in the US and abroad, I've started a Flickr Photo Group (see flickr badge to the right): http://www.flickr.com/groups/fedupwithschoollunch/ If you choose to join my photo group, your "homework" is to take a picture and share it. The photo can be anything related to school lunch. You might be a teacher who wants to take a photo of the lunch at your school. You might be a nutritionist who wants to highlight some really great lunches. You might be a lunch lady who wants to share some terrific (or not so terrific) meals. What are you (students, kids, teachers) eating for school lunch? Or even what great lunches have you packed for your child? I need you to know that I will be monitoring the content aggressively. The group rules include: Post only your own pictures (taken by you). Please obtain parental permission to post pictures of students' faces. If you must post pictures of students' without parental permission (as in a large group photo), please blackout their faces. Might as well get adults' permission to post their faces on the photo group. For example, you can take a picture of your own child with a lunch, because you are that child's parent. For this reason I haven't taken pictures of the cafeteria or the lunch line because I do not have parental permission to shoot the kids. You also must have a Yahoo ID to access Flickr (it's a part of Yahoo). And if you want to enjoy the photos and comment, you do need to log in with your Yahoo ID. A picture is worth a thousand words. It seems that mine are making a difference... and I want you to be a part of the School Lunch Revolution.
