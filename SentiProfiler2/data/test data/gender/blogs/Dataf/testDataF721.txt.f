Parents are probably the most interesting and the most annoying couples on this Earth. I think they act in such bizarre ways to get noticed by their aging offspring. I would gladly acknowledge my parents in a friendlier manner more often if they weren't so strange all the time. I don't know if they think because I'm a teenager they need to be "cool" but I would prefer them not try at all becuase I'd rather see their genuine selves.
I'm starting to realize that my mom and dad aren't just the people who have raised and taught me specific morals and lessons in life but they are also people who have thoughts and opinions. I would really love to hear what they think about certain topics but they just don't let this wall down so all I really get from them are lessons on what is good and what is bad. My parents and I have a good relationship, don't get me wrong, but I want to talk to them like they are just regular people.
