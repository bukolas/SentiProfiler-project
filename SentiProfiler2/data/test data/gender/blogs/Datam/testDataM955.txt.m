Kristen called me with a aditude and said she was coming over and ppicking up her things. She came over and was very aggressive with me over petty things and she took her cloths. After she had things packed up she reminded me how empty my house will look like when she takes all the furniture away too. I just looked at her and said its ok they are just objects Kristen we need to focus on Aleya more then anything. She then told me that her mom was heading out of town all next week and if I wanted time with Aleya I could watch her all that week. I was very happy about that.
