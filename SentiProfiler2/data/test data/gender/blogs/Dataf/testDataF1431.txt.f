his is the only food I have purchased for my bully since he was ten months old. It was highly recommended in my online bully groups; so thought I would try it. And I have never been disappointed for a minute! I have noticed how much easier it is for my dog to eat this than the puppy food he was on; as well as the fact that his flatulence is now virtually non-existant. I can't vouch for the flavor as my dog will eat anything; but I do believe in this product! I buy mine at Petco; and a bag at a cost of approximately $35 will last me about a month; and every tenth bag is free!
