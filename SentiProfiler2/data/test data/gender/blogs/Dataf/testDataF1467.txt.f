....Nothing much to write about today. Nothing has pissed me off, nothing making me feel like turning cartwheels. Although, if I turned a cartwheel right now, it would probably end up in a trip to the emergency room and that would piss me off. I just felt like typing so random stuff floating around in my head is ending up here. 
Is that how you spell babbling? for some reason it doesn't look correct, but spell check says it is right. hmmm? Oh well.

Why is it the games Dare likes the most are the ones with the most annoying sounds? Why is he soooo good at them?  I kinda miss the simple games I used to play. Especially the one where you shoot at the gopher stealing carrots out of your garden. If you hit him he would say "ugh, I'm hit. Going down." If you only came close he would jump up and down saying "what was that for you idiot?" and then flip you off. I missed on purpose often. Drove my mom insane.
