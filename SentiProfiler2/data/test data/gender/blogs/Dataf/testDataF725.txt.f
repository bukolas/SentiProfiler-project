Before you make any pre-judgements about Animal Planet ordering a reality show about Mike Tyson and pigeons, let's take a look at some the titles that make up their current programming roster; Animal Precinct, Monsters Inside Me, Jessica the Hippo and Pit Bulls and Parolees. Now with that frame of reference, is "Mike Tyson Playing with Pigeons" really that bizarre?Actually the current working title of Animal Planet's Mike Tyson pigeon racing project is Taking on Tyson.  Not what I would have gone with, but that's probably because for me, the real draw is racing pigeons not Mike Tyson.
