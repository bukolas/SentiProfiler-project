For example, seeking help from Russia against Jews in Palestine. This type of assistance is Haram by the agreement of the Ulema of Fiqh and it forfeits the ultimate aim of jihad. There are several contradictory hadith on this subject. The following are hadith that forbid seeking help from Kuffar: 1- Hadith in Sahih Muslim: He (sallallahu alayhe wa salam) said to a Mushrik on the Day of Badr, "Get back, I will not accept the help of a disbeliver." (Nayl al Autar 7/128). 2- Another hadith: "We do not seek help from disbelievers against disbelievers." (Reported by Muslim, Nayl al-Autar 7/128) And there is a sahih narration that Safwaan Bin Umaya fought alongside the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wa salam) and he was a Kaffir. An Nawawi said, in Tahtheeb al Asma wal Loughat 263: "Safwan Bin Umaya saw Hunayn with the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wa salam) as a Kaffir". The Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhe wa salam) borrowed on the Day of Hunayn the shields from Safwan Bin Umay. He said to him, "this loan will be returned to you". Sahih hadith reported by al Hakim, see Sahih Al-Jaamia' 3862. It is well narrated by the Biographers that Qasman marched out with the Prophet (sallallahu alayhe wa salam) on the day of Uhud and killed three flag bearers of the Mushrikun. The Prophet (saw) said of him: "Allah may support this religion by an evil man." Consequently, because of the contradictory hadiths the scholars differ as to how to reconcile them. The seeking of help from the disbelievers was forbidden but later abrogated. Al Hafiz in Al Talkhees said this is the best reconciliation, and ash-Shafi'i agrees. (Nayl Al-Autar 8/44) The Four Imams are in agreement that seeking assistance from the Kuffar is restricted to conditions: 1) The rule of Islam must have the upper hand, that is to say, the Muslims must be stronger than the combined group of the disbelievers from whom they are seeking help as well as the disbelievers they are fighting. This is in case the disbelievers decide to collaborate against the Muslims. 2) The Kuffar must have a good opinion of the Muslims, and the Muslims must feel safe from their treachery and this is estimated from their behavior. 3) The Muslims must be in need of the Kaffir or the Kuffar they ask help from. Opinion of the Madhahibs: Hanafi Opinion: Mohammed Bin al Hasan said in Sharaha Kitab as Sir Faqara 201: "It is acceptable for Muslims to ask help from the disbelievers against the disbelievers if the rule of Islam has the upper hand." Al-Jassas said in Ahkam Al-Quran: "Our peers said, "it is acceptable to seek help in fighting from disbelievers against disbelievers that when the coalition becomes dominant, the rule of Islam is uppermost." Maliki Opinion: Ibn al Qasim said: "It is not my opinion that they may seek their assistance in fighting alongside with them unless they occupy servant roles, then I see no problem with this." (Al Maduna 2/40) Imam Malik said: "It is not my opinion that they may seek help from disbelievers against disbelievers unless they occupy servant roles". (Al Qurtubi 8/100) Shafi'i Opinion: Ar Ramli said: "The Imam or second in command may ask help from the Kuffar even if they are Ahlul Harb (people otherwise at war with Muslims) if he knows they have a good opinion of us under the condition that we need them to serve or fight because we are few." (Nihayat al Mahtaj 8/58 and Takmila al Majmua 19/28). Hanbali Opinion Ibn Qadamah said: "From Ahmad it is permissible to ask help from the disbelievers, in fact it is Ahmad's opinion that the Kaffir has a share in the booty if he participated in the expedition under the Imam. He went outside of the opinion of the majority which does not allow him a share." (Al Mughni 8/414) didnt Muhammad(sws) strike a deal with the jewish tribes to help each other out if the other other hostile tribes attacked them?
