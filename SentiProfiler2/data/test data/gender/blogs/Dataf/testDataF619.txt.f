Then I could get the finisher medal AND the "coast-to-coast" medal for doing races @ both parks in same year. but i can't. not fitting the schedule OR my budget. ~i really, really want to start taking yoga @ a local yoga place, but cannot seem to make it fit into my schedule OR my budget (again). :( ~really looking forward to running another race with Beth , Page and Meghan...i haven't had that much fun in a long time. ~i can't help feeling a bit competitive nowadays with this running stuff...I want to set a new PR for my next 5K as well as the next 1/2 I do. 1.

Where was the hangout spot when you were a teenager? Primo's Pizza. ~i'm sitting at SBUX for my regular-Sunday-study-session..except...I'm blogging, not studying...scold me please! I am having a really HARD time focusing. This semester is kicking my butt for some reason...I have a lot to do, but I've had heavier semesters with more work, so not sure why I'm feeling like my head is just barely above water. ~early this a.m. I finally finished transcribing 20 minutes of a counseling session. It took FOREVER and is 7 pages long (single spaced!) Now I have to go through and make comments throughout regarding my responses and how I was feeling during the session in relation to my responses. THEN I have to write a two page paper about the case. I should really be working on that instead of blogging... ~E and I woke up at 8am this morning. I was so excited to see that we slept in an extra hour. Then I remembered that I changed my clock before going to sleep. Darn! No extra sleep for me. ~Oh and I managed to run 4 miles on Friday evening, but have had lower back pain ever since. not good. i've never had back pain after running before. what is going on? my new best friend...ibuprofen. ~Ok I need to stop reminiscing (fondly) of last weekend and how much fun I had and get back to reality...and studying. ~Happy Sunday~~ ~just to clarify...DisneyWorld is NOT the Happiest Place on Earth it claims to be...just ask E! ~yep, that would be him in FULL MELTDOWN MODE while we were in line for Space Mountain . Upon ride entrance, it was posted as a 30 minute wait but turned out to be closer to 45. Regardless, E hit his limit at about the 20 minute mark...and for NO reason at all except that he didn't want to be there anymore...well I take that back...he DID want to be there, right ON the floor. He was COMPLETELY calm while laying on the (nasty, gross, dirty) floor, but when I went to pick him up....the kicking, wiggling &amp; screaming began. And it was ugly. very, very, ugly indeed. ~I'm glad it was dark/dim in there because I was probably turning 47 shades of red from sheer embarrassment &amp; humiliation. The stares from everyone in line were nearly unbearable for me. I'm one who lets what others think really bother me and while I realize I will never see any of those people again, I was still quite upset about the crazy scene that my fabulous son was making! ~ Dawn (AKA "the baby whisperer") was waiting in line with us and since she didn't want to ride she was able to take E out of line once we reached the point where the line opens up and allows you to do that...which seemed about 1000 miles away at the time. I have never felt a greater sense of relief in my life once he was out of line &amp; no longer sprawled out on the floor. Note: I went on this trip to WDW with plans to ride only 2-3 things and instead spend the majority of time on things E would enjoy...and after this experience in line, I really didn't care if I went on another single ride all weekend. ~Thankfully that was the ONLY time he had a full meltdown over the weekend. ~did I mention we are also struggling with him hitting these days? oh TWO is such a lovely age. please note the extreme sarcasm here. ~oh and here's hoping that age 3 is better than 2 as it's official....I'm signing up for the 2011 WDW Princess 1/2!!! Woohoo! Registration begins on May 1, 2010. OK - I have finally had a chance to complete this post with pictures...Blogger really needs to improve their picture uploading process...one at a time is the pits! Anyway...here we go... Dawn wanted to see my dishes...we got these as a wedding gift and well, after using them, I no longer like them...they are navy blue and the round plates dip in to much, almost making a bowl shape and the small square plates...well those pointy corners are a pain for the dishwasher and well they are just overall a pain. The bowls are "ok", but a tad bigger would be better and the teacups, well, we NEVER use them. Ahhh, they may look good on the shelf initially, but you learn alot once you start USING an item. I'm ready for new dishes, but waiting until more of these break... Beth wanted to see my laundry room. This would probably be the most boring and drab room in the house. In fact, I just recently told O I want to paint it because (1) it's plain white and (2) it is right off the garage so receives all kinds of bangs to the wall etc and could use a coat of paint to brighten it up...please leave me your color suggestions. Hopefully in my next house I'll have a bigger laundry room, it was really something I was searching for before we bought this house, but just didn't work out. This was a hard picture to take, hence two shots, one from each side, because literally the room is only the length of the two machines side my side. Hydrant Girl wanted to see my favorite part of the house...that would be my office...when I'm able to get in there and really get things done or just relax and surf the web. Travel &amp; Dive Girl wanted to see my kitchen counter, where I do my baking...it's not much and it's a bit smaller than I'd like it, but I make do for now. That corner cabinet is where all my baking ingredients are stored, so at least it's convenient. Sara wanted to see my living room as it is now...eeks...toys abound and if you look closely you can see E's head near the fireplace...he was likely adding more toys to the floor. Oh and that window treatment is a thorn in my side...it never stays in place so it usually just looks like a piece of fabric thrown up there. Lindsay wanted to see a view from E's perspective...i took 2 shots... Fidgeting Gidget wanted to see my favorite shirt and my softball glove. I am a "life is good" t-shirt junkie and I really like this one right now... "less is s'more"...haha. And my ancient softball glove - how i miss thee - poor thing hasn't been used since 2006. sad! Brandi wanted to see the entrance or foyer to my house. Sadly my house is so ridiculously small that we don't have a traditional foyer, the front door basically dumps right into our living room...so as you walk in, this is what you see. Also, unless we have guests coming over the front door is rarely used since we come in through the garage. Hula had to squeeze herself into the picture. ~i took E to school this morning and i'm home today working on a long list of things to-do...I should NOT be blogging...let's consider it my lunch break. ~i completed my fafsa for next (and the last) school year. finally!! such a pain! ~I am finishing up the past 2 weeks "reflections" on my counseling activities at the high school...you know, being in this touchy-feely profession means lots of reflecting on myself and how I feel. ~finishing up a couple of lesson plans on nutrition topics. I need to do some classroom guidance in the CDC room for the rest of the semester....I'm way behind on my direct hours. ~made a call to the Disney ticket office. got good news which will hopefully prevent me from losing a day on my 3 day ticket since we only made it to the parks on Sat &amp; Sun. ~heading to the post office this afternoon to mail 4 packages. ~i really need to get all this school stuff done so I can use the weekend to do a transcription of one of my counseling sessions that will occur Thurs/Fri this week. Note: transcriptions take FOREVER...every.single.word.noise.um.like.ok need to be documented. ~i've become a fan of interval running now. really want to go to Target to look for a watch like Meghan had for the race. ~i signed up for a 5K on April 10, 2010...it benefits the schools, I can even pick a particular school to benefit. yay. ~still need to upload my Disney pictures to Shutterfly...dreading that...big time suck. ~back to the schoolwork. ~i took 180 pictures on my Canon Rebel and I took 17 with the point and shoot along the race course...for a grand total of 197 pictures...so that means that the winner is.... AMY !!!!! Let me know where to send your Disney prize... ~I have not been able to download my pictures yet, but here is a brief review of the race...hoping to post pictures later tonight. ~The short story: I met my time goal, finished the 13.1 miles and I avoided the "van of doom"...the one that picks you up if you fall behind a 16/min mile pace. Phew!! ~I got about 4 hrs of sleep the night before the race &amp; was fighting off some intense nerves which caused me to have a super upset tummy.all.night.long. and then I woke 30 minutes before the alarm...ugh. A rough start. ~I met Meghan, Jessica, and Beth in the lobby at absolutely insane hour of 3:30am to head to the race start. We waited around some, used the porta-potties some, froze some, checked our gear, headed to our corral, froze some more, peed in the bushes (where I got burrs all over the back of my shirt) and then finally started our race. ~Meghan, Beth, Page (Beth's friend) and I were all in Corral E and started at 6:28am...after being "in process" for 3 hours... ~Meghan and I ran the first 9 or so miles together doing 5/1 intervals after running the entire first mile. ...at about the 9 mile mark I could not continue with Meghan as I needed more recovery time...she kept going and I lagged behind with a bit more walking, although not too much more. In the end, I finished 6 minutes after her. ~At every mile mark, there was a princess-theme billboard w/time clock and music. There were tons of characters along the way as well and while we thought we would stop for pictures, we quickly changed our mind when we saw the crazy long lines. ~I realized how much I like the song "Holding Out for a Hero" by Bonnie Tyler :) Really though, it has got to be THE perfect "make-you-want-to-run" song. Or maybe it was just that it was playing as I passed the Disney float thingee with 5 Disney Princes on it...i dunno, let's just say it was the song. ~My goal was to finish under 3 hours and I (barely) did just that... 2:58:26 was my finish time. I'm already thinking that's not good enough and want to improve it...I'm sure these feelings will fade in a couple of days. LOL!! ~I would love to do the Princess 1/2 again next year and I'm making tentative plans (in my head)...so now it's just a matter of the stars aligning correctly, i.e. date/timing. ~I took a bunch of pictures. I haven't totaled them up yet, but I will do that tonight and post the winner. ~Oh and I'm still putting together that "pictures of my home" post...hoping to finish that and post this week too.
