My sweeeeeeeeeeeet sister..The lines may seem a bit clich√©d to readers, but yes she is one sort of person I wud love to be with at all times ...Gone are the days when she asks me to imitate the college profs and crack pjs or rather mokkais and enjoy the scene..I get reminded of all those when I am all alone, dipped in an ocean of solitude missing the dearer ones.... One of the many people whom I miss badly right now......Missssssssssssss u a lot........And testimonials written truly with heart, out of affection generally have a bad and an incomplete ending....And I guess this fits well in such a category..........Will continue writing further..............
