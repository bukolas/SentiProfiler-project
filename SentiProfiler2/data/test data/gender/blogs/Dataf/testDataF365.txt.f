If we don't socialize medicine, we need to make it so that working families can afford health coverage. I am a single, working mother of 2, I have insurance through my job but it is expensive (13% of my gross wages). Last year my Gross income was $19,000. I have one child who qualifies for medicaid (Secondary) and one who does not. I don't know how that works since they both have the same parents.
