Some days later, Alessandro shared this interesting post about the several versions of Flash available on Android.It's now clear that a new Flash Lite is coming 'soon'.
What is it (apart to support AS3, alleluia) ? For which platform ? Available throught CS4 or CS5 
Like I reported previously, it's strange how Adobe isn't sharing the information on FLite 4.0...Perhaps to avoid the confusion with FP10.1 ?
I only hope one thing : to see FL4 (and FP10.1) working on Android emulator!
Actually, apart an old S60 SDK which let you play FL1.1, I never found an emulator (nokia, se, android,...) able to play FL files
and no, unfortunatly, the HTC Desire ROM doesn't work on Android emulator, since it's not for the right ARM processor :(
