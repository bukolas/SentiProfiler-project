Hi Sarimah, I am watching the show and you did a great job. Answering you questions, well, this is because of the muscle mass that basically guys having higher muscle mass compared to women. 1kg of muscle will burns approximately 31 calories (without exercise) that we call BMR-Basal Metabolic Rate. More muscle means more fat burnt. The second things is, during exercising, guys will use more energy than women does. Says weight lifting. Guys can bring up 30KG weight, but women maybe 10KG. Means that guys will burn more calories because they use more energy compared to women.
