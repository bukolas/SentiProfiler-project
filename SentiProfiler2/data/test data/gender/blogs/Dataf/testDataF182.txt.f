This is the best epilator I have come across with. I love it! I have quite some facial hair and I use it on my sideburns and under my chin. Ive had it since I was 11 when it first came out and it has never bailed on me. I am looking for one of these epilators too and everywhere I look says 'currently unavailable'. What idiot company would run out of such a popular shaver?? Doesn't say much about philips/norelco does it. Please if someone knows where to find one, please let me know I have had this epilator years one of the best products i have ever brought.It does hurt a LITTLE for the first couple of times.I dropped mine on the floor and broke the on off switch even though it still works i would like to replace it with the same one or new model does anybody know where i can get one thanks..excellent investment. I have also had this product for a few years but need to replace it! I cant find this product anywhere so Im guessing there must be an upgrade to it or something with a different name, as I have seen loads of similar ones! Can anyone help me please? I love my HP6443, have had it for years and now I think it has decided its time is done. So, I want to buy an identical new one and cannot find anywhere to purchase it! Can anyone direct me? Thanks. I have been Epilating for 20 years. I have found this brand and product well worth it! It is pain at first but body adjusts and before you know it you are using it all over your body (stay away from face).
