Chelsea V Liverpool - live on ESPN at 21:25 IST on sunday
It will be for the 17th time that these 2 sides will be meeting since Rafael Benitez became the Liverpool manager and since then they have won only 5 times n Chelsea have won 8 times. Liverpool currently struggling for good results will be without their star striker Fernando Torres, who is suffering from a hamstring injury but is expected to return for the Champions League clash against Inter in 10 days time. Also missing will be Voronin, Arbeloa, Aurelio and Agger. Xabi Alonso is suspended. Babel too might miss due to a knock he picked up during the midweek while on international duty. Chelsea will be without Terry and Shevchenko while Lampard and Mikel could be playing. I hate to say this but Chelsea may win comfortably unless Liverpool put up a spirited performance to at least manage a draw.
Prediction - Chelsea 1 - 0 Liverpool 

Manchester United v Manchester City - live on ESPN at 18:55 IST on sunday
One of the biggest derby games in England is the Manchester derby. Manu have lost thrice this season and all of those came when Rooney did not play. Rooney will miss this game due to suspension. Also missing from United squad will be Evra, Neville and Saha. Duo of Corluka and Elano are suspended for City and Richards is also likely to be rested after knee complaint. Zimbabwe forward Benjani will be making his City debut. City have not won at Old Trafford since 1974 and this year too wont be different. Having lost 3 - 1 to Arsenal at home, City have almost no chance of winning at Old Trafford.
Prediction- Manchester United 3 - 0 Manchester City
