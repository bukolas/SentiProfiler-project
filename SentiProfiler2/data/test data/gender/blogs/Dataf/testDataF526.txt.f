We were shocked to see that accident of our new vehicle, which we came to take our home. We were emotionally hurt by this incident. Immediately, we rushed to the Sales Manager of BIMAL, Mr.Dhanraj. Since, he was not available in the showroom one of his executive connected us over the phone to talk to him. We narrated the whole incident to Mr.Dhanraj. He started shouting at us and asked to get out of the showroom taking the same vehicle in the same condition. Giving the reason that the ownership of the vehicle is being transferred by making registration of the vehicle, Mr.Dhanraj told that he is no more responsible for anything that happened. When we requested him to come to the spot and rectify the problem, he started abusing us telling that he is having a family and not to disturb him on his holiday. We tried calling him again and again, he did not respond to our call. Further, a tedious struggle began to reach some other senior officers of BIMAL Auto Agency, but none of the executives gave any information about their seniors.
