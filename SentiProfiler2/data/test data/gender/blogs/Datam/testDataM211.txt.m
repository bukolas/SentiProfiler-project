In 1959, a strapping young Trinidadian named Mike Quashie emigrated to New York and helped ignite the limbo dance craze. He became a darling of the city’s society set, a fixture of the downtown fashion scene and a sort of left-field rock icon.

In the 1960s, Mr. Quashie’s troupe included a dancer named Jean Lee, fresh to New York from her hometown of Atlantic City. Mr. Quashie took her under his wing for a few years until they went their separate ways and lost touch.

Last year, Mr. Quashie left his longtime apartment in Greenwich Village for an assisted-living residence in the Bronx. He had no family around him, no money, few visitors. While other residents displayed chipper family photographs, Mr. Quashie put up a faded snapshot from his Apollo days. His old carnival masks hung next to his walker.

But suddenly, there in the home full of strangers, he saw a face from the old days, someone who knew this man before his magnificent body had gone soft and slow, before his back and his knees became shot from the strain of the limbo.

It was Ms. Lee. Her dancing days long behind her, she was now a psychiatric nurse at this very home.

“When she came in the room to say hello, I just completely flipped out,” Mr. Quashie, 79, said the other day. “I said, ‘I don’t believe that I’m in a home and here’s Jean.’ ”

Ms. Lee, 72, said that Mr. Quashie’s name jumped out at her when she heard a list of new admissions. “I said, ‘Wait a minute — is he from Trinidad?’ ” she recalled. “I said: Send him to me. That’s someone I know very well, and that I’d take care of him.”

Susan Quist, a friend of Mr. Quashie who handles many of his affairs, said Mr. Quashie’s social workers selected the Bronx home, a residence near Fordham Road operated by Jewish Home Lifecare, from a list that she requested for him. “It’s a minor miracle” that his paths crossed with Ms. Lee, she said. “Jean sings his praises around that place, and shares his stories. He’s the big man on campus there now.”
