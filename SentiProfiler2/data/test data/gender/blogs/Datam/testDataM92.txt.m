The Hindi literature is divided into four major forms they are 1.Adi kaal 2.Bhakti kaal, 3.Ritikavya kaal and 4. Adhunik kaal . In the ancient period the main center of development of Hindi were Delhi, Ajmer, kannauj and the central part of India Madhya pradesh.Chand Bardai composed a poem for his king Prithviraj Chauhan named "Prithviraj Raso" whic is considered as the first work in the history of Hindi literature. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan all most all creative work in the field of Hindi was destroyed and a very few scriptures or manuscripts are available. This era is considered as aadi kaal. During the later part of aadi kaal and early Bhakti kaal many sint-poets became famous and Vidyapati was one of them.
"Bhakti kaal" It is considered as the middle stage of the development of Hindi literature.The work in this period mostly comprises of long poems.There was a great development in the field of poetry during this period. Different form of poems like Dohas and Chupaya are the innovations of this period.Again Bhakti kaal can be divided into two catogeries 1. Nirgrna(the followers of a formless god) ,Kabir and Gurunanak were followers of Nirguna. And 2. Saguna( the followers of God with attributes) ,Surdas and Tulsidas were followers of Saguna. In the very time most of the poems were written in Avadhi or Braj Bhasha. The major works of this period are Padmavat and Ramcharitmanas written by Malik Muhammad jayasi and Tulsidas respectively. "Sur Sagar " written by Surdas was a graet work in Braj Bhasha. This was the age when two diverse religion the Hindu and the Islamic mingled together to server the Hindi literature..Many Muslim poets like Abdul Rahim who was a court poet of Akbar was a great devotee of Krishna and used to write in Hindi.
"Ritikavya Kaal" During this period the erotic element became dominant.This era is called Riti bucause this was the age when poetry forms and theory were developed to the fullest.But this affected the poetry by taking its emotive aspect which was considered as chief aspect of the "Bhakti kaal" and the poetry gradually started deteriorating. The most well known book of this age is Satasai written by Bihari.
"Adhunik kaal" This is considered as the period after 1900. The man who brought life in the hindi literature was Premchand.Before him the Hindi literature was considered as fictitious. He is considered as one of the best story writer and novelist in the field of Hindi.By this time, hindi had become the general public's language. To distinguish themselves from the general masses, the learned Muslims used to write in Urdu, while Khadiboli became prominent among educated Hindus. Khadiboli with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or Sahityik Hindi was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others.importantwriters of this period are Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Maithili Sharan Gupt etc. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Khadiboli popular among the educated people.
Today Hindi is at a juncture where it is being considered to loose its race with English.Even though declared as the National language and official language higher class people and people working in corporate world use it rarely. Hence it is the time when the whole India, the government employee and government funded institution should come forward and make Hindi as an "official language " and the "LANGUAGE OF INDIA".
