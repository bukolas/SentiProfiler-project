Finally! I got a full day's work done. Almost 4k, and if my hand hadn't started hurting I would have gotten even more done.

There's nothing I hate more than wanting to go go go and my body won't let me. Grr. But I'm finally past the three-quarter mark on Hecate's Own and I'm about to write the big showdown, save-the-day scene, after which there will be food, sex, and more food, knowing Zach. Once that's done, it's time for the Meat Grinder and the Beta Readers while I switch gears and begin serious work on Norwegian Wood.

I keep thinking I'm missing something, though. Something important. Hopefully it will come out in the Meat Grinder and I'll slap myself silly, fix it and move on. If not, my Betas will find it, slap me silly, and I'll fix it and move on.

I haven't gotten the artwork yet on Mating Games, and I'm still waiting for word on Noble Blood, but I knew I would be. Laurie was swamped with Red Hot Fairy Tale submissions, so for everyone who's waiting to hear the fate of Duncan, Jaden and Moira hopefully I'll have word no later than the end of April.

Oh! And if you've emailed me and I haven't responded, please email me again! I've been so caught up I may have missed it. Our oldest graduates grade school this year, we're planning a trip to Disney and I've got RT coming up, so when I'm able to sit at the computer I've been concentrating a lot on that stuff since writing wasn't much of an option the last few weeks.

I know. Bad author. No cookie for me.

P.S. Samhain Publishing is hosting the second annual Sammie Awards at the Samhain Cafe this Sunday! I'll be there if I have to sit Dusty down and make HIM type for me! Hope to see you there!
