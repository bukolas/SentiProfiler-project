I have struggled with my anger issues since I was a about 18. I am 40. I am ashamed because I did something so stupid today. I was having a bad morning, and was in tears at my house before I woke my daughter up to take her to preschool. The whole way to the school, was spent fluctuating between faking a smile and talking sweetly to my beautiful girl and then obsessing in my head about all of my stress (the possibility of losing my job, the stress of problems in my marriage, finances, house repairs, a meeting I was going to be late for, I was overwhelmed with too much on my plate). When I got to the school, I pulled into the car pool line and, I thought the woman with the flailing arms was waiving me ahead but then she jumped in front of me and she rushed to my car. I rolled the window down to tell her I was sorry and I thought I was supposed to go ahead and merge in with the other lane of traffic but before I could say anything she started blurting directions and then I said "oh, I thought I was supposed to go this way." She said "you are but you are not supposed to cut in line." She said it rudely and condescendingly . She scolded me as she would a 4th grader. So, I immediatley felt stupid and I was already so upset, I just snapped. I dropped the f-bomb on her. I knew the second it came out of my mouth that I had made a huge mistake. I started shaking and I had tears in my eyes. Why did I do that? She was rude, but she did not deserve that. My reaction was unnacceptable. I cannot take it back now. I don't even really know who she is so I cannot appologize (but I don't know that I would have the guts to anyway). 

I worried about it all day. I actually wrote her an apology letter and it is in my purse. I had to go back to the school tonight for a parents meeting and the principle actually mentioned the outburst in her comments. When talking about the car pool line she said "I will not tolerate anyone cussing out one of my teachers. Which happened this morning." Half the crowd gasped in disbelief and disapproval. My body went numb, I thought I was going to faint. I actually wanted to slink away and die. No one actually knew she was taling about me, but I felt like they did. I fear that they did, or that they will learn it was me. I feel like I have given all power away -- like I cannot be involved with the school at all. My daughter has been there for 5 days and has 8 years left and I feel like I have ruined it. I want to run away. I took my letter to the parents meeting, but I did not give it to anyone because I was afraid. I thought about giving it to the principle and apologizing to her and asking her to give the letter to the teacher (since I did not recognize her). But I was afraid.
