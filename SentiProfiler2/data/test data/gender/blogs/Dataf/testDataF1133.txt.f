Exploring Rheumatoid Arthritis & Pregnancy I'm a 29 year old nearly-newlywed â€“ and I have rheumatoid arthritis. I was diagnosed just over a year ago, only a few short months after my wedding. It's been a bumpy road over the last year, but I am finally at a point where my health is in fairly good shape and I am essentially in remission (meaning I have limited swelling, pain and fatigue). But, that remission comes at a cost. That being some serious medications.
