Assalam u alaykum, Since the start of the neo-Crusade by the Kuffar led by US and Jews,almost all of their strategies in retaining control of already occupied Muslim lands has failed. Like colonial powers,they have employed local traitors and murtadeen against we Muslims and our Mujahideen. One policy ,they are especially fond of, because it lessens their own casualties in the short term,is using local militias.They label them under fancy names like public protection force,awakening council(majlis as sahwa),lashkars,arbakai,neighbourhood patrols, etc etc. While it is obvious these names suggest nothing, the first and most important goal of all such paid militias is this : hold localities against mujahideen,because their own forces suffered defeat at the mujahideen's hands. Local allies are always a great help in the short term. But as i said ,ONLY in the short term. The fact that slowly even these local militias face the dirt,is the present situation where the murtadeen of Sahwa are slowly and InshaAllah surely leaving the militias,giving the Islamic State of Iraq a golden chance to come back to the neighbourhoods that they lost in Anbar and Baghdad.The fact remains the Sahwa project was never successsful in the first place in Diyala,Ninawa,Salahaddin,and Kirkuk. I ask all the forum members to post whatever info and insights they have regarding these traitor militias, so that the common Muslims know about the enemies among us,and the mujahideen on the battle fields get useful advise in confronting them better.If Allah wills,this thread would be a great benefit to the Ummah.
