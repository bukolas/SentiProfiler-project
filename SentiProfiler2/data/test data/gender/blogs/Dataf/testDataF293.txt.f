Today's menu: cheeseburger, corn, peach fruit cup, popcorn chips, milk I'm feeling so yellow after this meal. Can you get over how everything is the same color? And then there's two corn-based sides... I love popcorn. It started because of my Grandma, who was a popcorn fanatic and ate it whenever she watched a movie. I'm not referring to movie theater popcorn, but popped on the stove, drizzled with real melted butter, and consumed while enjoying an old movie in her den. Good food is all about memories and family, no? I'm trying to figure out why the popcorn had to be made into crisps?! Popcorn is good without being further processed! The last picture is a look inside the package at this strange food. It didn't taste like popcorn to me.
