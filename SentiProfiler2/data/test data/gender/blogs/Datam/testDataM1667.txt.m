At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. ~Jean Houston

When people are laughing, they're generally not killing each other. ~Alan Alda

I am creating this blog in pursuit to put more laughter in the world. Not only will I post my own original parodies, but I will also introduce you to other parody creators. I will introduce you to parodies in all forms—songs, video clips, stories, and books. Stick around and I promise you’ll get a good laugh.

Mostly, I will be posting parodies that I made up in this blog. From time to time, I may review other parodies, parody writers, videos making fun of others, etc. Before I post a parody, I will first explain how the parody came to me. Often, it takes some time to explain, but it’s sometimes interesting to hear how my imagination works. Also, I know that if you have to explain the meanings of “jokes” and what not, that means that they aren’t funny. But there will be sometimes that I will want to explain certain parts of my parodies; a phrase, a verse or two.
