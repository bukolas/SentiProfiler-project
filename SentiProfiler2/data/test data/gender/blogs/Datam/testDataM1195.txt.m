In one room, Meade Esposito, the Democratic boss from Brooklyn, was tightening his grip on the Brooklyn waterfront.

Next door, New York’s former mayor, John V. Lindsay, was struggling with the teachers strike of 1968. And in the third room, an idealistic young woman from the Midwest was trying to teach poetry at Rikers Island.

It was just another day at a recording studio in Manhattan where New York stories are lifted off the printed page and into the spoken word for blind New Yorkers seeking audio versions of books about their city.

The little-known service is run by the New York Public Library out of the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library on West 20th Street.

“A lot of the books we record fall into that ‘New Yorkana’ category,” said Susan Mosakowski, a playwright and theater producer who runs the program, which puts out up to 50 titles a year, many of them New York-related books that have not had wide enough appeal to have been recorded by a publisher. “We have a lot of readers asking for books with a local interest, a local focus,” she said.

Dozens of New York-related books are displayed here: “NYPD: A City and Its Police,” by James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto;” “The Seltzer Man” by Ken Rush, about a veteran Brooklyn seltzer-schlepper; “Upper West Side Story,” by Peter Salwen.

A federal regulation enacted in the 1990s allows the library to record audio versions of books without having to secure publishing rights. Ms. Mosakowski has the luxury of being able to draw on New York City’s deep pool of vocal talent. Readers have included the Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn and Julie Pasqual, a storyteller, dancer and circus clown.
