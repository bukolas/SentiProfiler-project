I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining.  I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. But, the guy replied atleast I don't suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. Imagine how much it would suck to be them. Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing. If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a  person with no limbs at all. I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them. For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). But this is what your smart friends do to you. They extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. But this is what I relish. This is what I feel is the best part about having them around. Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. But smarter ones make life interesting. They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. That conversation left me in a similar place. Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend, I wasn't sure I had convinced myself. But, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. Now every time I compare myself in a situation, I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it. Ever since that day, I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere. For the most part, it has helped :) I like analogies. I love drawing parallels in life. Compare one stage with another. Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. To see how as we change we still remain the same. Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. As if it's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the sudden onset of loneliness.
