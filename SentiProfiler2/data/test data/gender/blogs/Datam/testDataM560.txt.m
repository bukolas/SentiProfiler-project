Ok … so a lesson has been learnt ! Never talk too soon ! Talked yesterday on how positivity had changed my condition and how fantastic I was feeling … hmm .. rubbish ! Nothing worked today ! Ha .. The pain was back, gym was a torture and an entire day spent in lamenting the uselessness of life. Nothing to discourage readers or to deflate their enthusiastic reactions to yesterdays blog, but … ya … just feel when you talk about it, it does not work. Better to do, than to open your mouth about it.
Many would disagree though. Not speaking up, a sign of weakness they would proclaim. But in this instance, I would rather go with what I have generally felt. We must do, others to talk on what we do. And its not important that what we do is talked about. So long as the reason for what we do, are taken in beneficially to the person for whom we do. Cause and reason should know. Not who contributed to the cause or reason. Better this way.
