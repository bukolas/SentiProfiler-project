Scumbag. He would brook no protest or discussion, cutting us off with "This is not a theology class". Hope you read this someday. Your attempts at indoctrination were transparent to most of us- we used to discuss them after class. Don't get me wrong. I used to play the guitar in the choir daily, and on every Friday, join the boys' choir in singing praises to Christ. Somehow, in that seemingly nonsecular school, there was still a separation of Church and "state". That balance, of course, was changed by Mr. Easwaran. Suddenly, we had an authority figure teaching us the history of the world from the viewpoint of one religion. Even in an inherently Christian nation like the United States, a similar incident created such a furor. In multi-religious Hindu majority India, surprisingly, nobody heard about it. Not one person bothered. The same scene is being repeated in many Indian schools. Does it matter? Hinduism seems yet undecided on its stance on whether it is an organized religion or a way of life; whether it is an "it", in the sense of an ancient religion whose adherents are slowly being outnumbered in its last bastion, is still open to debate.
