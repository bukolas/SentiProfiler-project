The first inhabitants of the area were of Aztec origin. Later the region was conquered by the P'urepecha (known as the Tarasco by the Spanish). Led by Tzitispandacuare the Tarascans defended their territories against the Aztecs. The Tarascans flourished in Mexico from 1100CE to 1530CE and although their exact origins are unknown linguistic similarities to the Quechua language of South America suggest they came from further south. The Tarascans and Aztecs were enemies and were frequently at war with each other. The Spanish empire saw the end View of the church in the evening of both empires. Knowing the Spaniards were on their way to the Aztec capital of Tenochitlan the Aztecs sent emissaries to the Tarascans to ask for assistence in fighting the Spaniards. Instead, the Tarascans sacrificed the Aztec messengers. Tenochitland fell in 1520 after a bloody seige and a scant two years later the Tarascan Empire was conquered too.
