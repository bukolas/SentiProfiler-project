From the moment I knew of Ben Stein, I knew he had worked for Nixon. I also knew he was relatively moderate when it came to economic policy (in as much as I can say, of course many would say that one can't be moderate if one disagrees with them). He felt that the wealthiest in America were paying a disproportionately lower percentage of their income (including capital gains) in taxes.
