Incorporating common genetic risk factors into the models typically used to calculate a women's breast cancer risk has little impact on clinical decision-making, such as whether an individual should consider earlier or more frequent mammography or prophylactic drugs, according to a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results follow similar studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, echoing what has now become a common criticism of genome-wide association studies; that this approach is unlikely to identify genetic risk factors of diagnostic value.

Over the last few years, researchers have used DNA-studded microarrays to quickly search tens of thousands of human genomes for common genetic variations linked to various diseases, dubbed genome-wide association studies. Despite the enormous size of these studies, they have only identified a fraction of the source of the genetic risk of disease. And the vast majority account for a very small change in risk in a given individual. (This is in contrast to rare genetic variants, like BRCA1, which substantially increase a women's risk of developing breast cancer.)
