United Front Games is the second studio to take on the True Crime franchise. The first, Luxoflux, was closed by Activision little over a month ago. With the new studio, and the new talent, comes a fresh take on True Crime. In a preview session at least week's Game Developers Conference, developers name checked the Hulk, Star Trek and Batman as inspirations. With no member of Luxoflux on board, this, they say, is a whole new game.
