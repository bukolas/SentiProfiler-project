After being in Miami for 90+ years Joe's Stone Crab opened its second location here in Chicago.  It has been a favorite for visitors and residents alike ever since. Although it is not the quintessential Chicago Steak House, for my tastes, it is much better.  Their specialty are the stone crabs.  They are fantastic and not readily available elsewhere.  I have had them at least 10 times.  However, recently I have become a big fan of their Alaskan King Crab legs.
