When I was a young boy my Grandmother came to live with us for a while, and she loved the soap operas on the radio. I can’t remember the names of them but there was One Man’s Family, but every day she wanted to listen to those. This was a prank as a young boy I would set up the phonograph so when she came in to listen, instead of the soap operas coming on, the theme music for drag net would come on and she wouldn’t know how to change it. So she would have to come get me and I would change it back.
