okie so i guess i have to be really nice n write all d good things about my evil cousin!!! besides being my cousin he is a great friend... he is one person who can handle my non stop bickering...the best part is he always listens(a good listener), i can practically confide ne thing in him,u just start talking to him n u feel so much at ease that things just keep coming out,he is very relaxed n chilled out n very fun loving! he has an amazing sense of humour.. its very difficult to be in his company n not laugh.. he always brings a smile to my face..he can be amazingly cute at one point n the next minute he would do something to really piss me off! we have our fights (but thats fun). i am really proud of him considering a big brain that he is(always showered with scholarships n stuff)..since i dont stay in chennai so ne updates regarding d latest tamil music or movies he is the one to let me know.in  all a great friend,big brother,cousin,really fun to hang out with,has always been dere for me..A COOL DUDE!!!
