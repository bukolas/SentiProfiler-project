If, when cleaning a leek or dismembering a chicken, you hear a distinctive, French-accented voice in your head telling you precisely what to do next, don't be alarmed. It's just Jacques Pépin-or, rather, one of his many tips you've absorbed from years of watching him on TV-floating to the surface. Starting in 1991 with Today's Gourmet, he's hosted 11 series for KQED; his latest, Fast Food My Way, premiered in October 2004. But the 69-year-old Pépin is also quite the Renaissance man (with an MA in French lit from Columbia University, no less) who, despite his Gallic upbringing and heritage, has an astute take on today's American culture-as we found out when we spoke to him by phone from his home in Connecticut.

Foie gras has been in the news, especially here in California, where a law was just passed to ban, eventually, its production. What do you think of all the hoopla?
It's a tempest in a teacup, you know. Most of the people against foie gras have never even been on a farm. If it was traumatizing in any way, it would do a lot of damage to the animal and to the liver, which would make in inedible. If you want to talk about torturing animas, go see the way they raise chickens. They blind them and cut off their beaks so they can't fight. The noise in a factory chicken farm is atrocious-this is why eggs have such a high level of cholesterol. They found out years ago that putting acoustic tiles in the room to lower the noise cut the cholesterol level by 10 to 15 percent.

You've been a proponent of sustainable cuisine-have you ever considered doing a cookbook or a TV show that features sustainable methods of raising food?
No, because for me that is just part of the equation. I use organic food when I can, but I'm not going to stop eating when there isn't any. I would have an argument with Alice [Waters] because if an ingredient is not organic, she doesn't want it. Me, I'll take a tomato if it's an extraordinary tomato, even if it's not organic, over an organic tomato that has no taste whatever. People think that because [something's] organic, it's extraordinary. I've had lousy organic food.

For years you've taught at the French Culinary Institute in New York and at Boston University. Are students these days more concerned with fame and fortune than with just learning the basics?
Oh, yes-probably one out of two are at school because they want to be a celebrity chef. They will come in for an interview and say, “Well, I'd like to do a book like you and a television show like you, so who do you think I should call?” like there is some secret number. It still gives me a shot in the arm, though, to work with students.
