'0OSAMA BIN LADENRELIGIOUS FANATICSNONE\"just a test, will link off our home page at CSU Fresno if ok.\"000\"Because we are all so confused.  I think the terrorists are confused about religion, confused about cultures, confused about each others wants and needs.  I think they may hold us responsible for things we never knew we were responsible for.  At the same time, I think we were deeply confused, not about the danger that terrorists around the world pose, but we were deeply confused about how to respond to this sooner.  \"\"Many, many, many people and events.  Osama Bin Laden, network of terrorists all around the world, our own country\'s inability to understand the hatred of militant members of Islam, our administration\'s inability to respond without weapons... I hold everyone responsible... including myself for not understanding these things sooner.\"\"I am so deeply torn in so many different ways by these events.  First, the tragic jet crashes were so much more than I can bare.  Thinking about the waves and waves of people dying at several different moments (the initial impact killing passengers and office workers, people jumping out of windows in New York, people crashing to the ground in heaps of rubble... even the inadvertent ways people died... maybe falling down the stairs, getting into car accidents, etc.) has just crushed me over the past few days.  The word  Horror  cannot even begin to describe.  At the same time, I am so troubled by the images of destruction that are saturating our radio and air waves... I wonder how those who lost loved ones in these tragedies feel about seeing replays of the jets and continuing body counts replayed over and over again. At the same time, I agree that our nation will change... but I am so fearful of what that change will be.  What is our nation going to look like in a few months, years, decades?  What civil liberties will we have to sacrifice?  What freedoms will we have to throw away in order to secure the overall theme of democracy?  Why don\'t we talk about those potential lost liberties as a casualty of this conflict. I am struck by the media... its wizardry, precision, and grace in one moment... and its blatant stupidity the next.  One of the greatest characteristics of a free democratic society is the ability of its citizens to debate, yet there seems to be no debate about this -- we\'re going to war.  What the hell happened to the debate?  Why don\'t we, as a nation, understand exactly why these terrorists chose to sacrifice themselves?  Why aren\'t we, as a people, being told about the world\'s hatred for us and why have we never understood this fact?  Why aren\'t we doing something about this?  I fear, more and more, that our country is simply entering into its  war machine  state, and I feel, more and more, that our nation\'s media is entering lock-step with our military leaders.  Our nation\'s media has spent the last few years (in times of prosperity) questioning every subtle move that administrations have made... they\'ve questioned phraseology, words, and the subtle context clues hidden within raised eye brows and smirks.  But what now.... no one seems to be questioning the why the administration is going down this path, whether there are any other options,  why  the world is pissed off with us to begin with.  Where has our media gone?  What are they going to look like when this is over with. I am currently applying to law school, and it is so hard to think about that at a time like now.  However, the law school admissions process is the only thing that\'s keeping me sane.  The deadlines have at least given order to my life... they\'ve focused me somewhat.  I feel so fortunate just to be able to say that I want to go to law school... to have a dream... and to be alive to be able to realize that dream.  Finally, just seeing application deadline dates like  January 12, 2002  show me that there will be a tomorrow.\"\"I pause, occasionally, whenever I hear a plane fly overhead.  I wouldn\'t call it fear, just a pause.  I won\'t be flying anytime in the near future, and I don\'t know if I\'ll ever just pass a firefighter or a police officer again without mentally praising them in my mind.\"None.\"The Islamic terrorists are completely evil.   This is a wake-up call to the U.S., a second Pearl Harbor. It is time to abandon the policing paradigm of investigation and a summons to a court.  That is no longer appropriate.  I\'m not sure it ever worked against terroism anyway. It is time to recognize that a war is being inflicted upon us, and to respond following the war paradigm:  Kill the enemy until they beg for peace.  Hang their leaders.  Occupy their land and re-educate them. I do not believe that this was done by a few madmen out of a peaceful population.  These acts had a lot of financial backing, and the quiet support of governments and quasi-governmental organizations.  We\'ve seen video of people dancing in the streets when they got this news.  Those people are our enemies. Don\'t just go for one terrorist organization. We know there are several who might have been involved, and they will be in on the next mass murder if they weren\'t in on this one. Kill them all. \"A consortium of anti-Western terrorist organizations.\"The hate  Western civilization  and the U.S. as the leading figure in it.  They feel humiliated because Islam is supposed to lead the world, according to their lights, and it\'s not. They feel inadequate and second rate, and feel our mere existence is an insult to God. They feel their culture is being undermined by our movies and videos, and by envy of our way of life.  We have made many Arabs rich by buying their oil, but they feel poor in spirit.  There is nothing we can do to assuage their feelings, except to die.  If everyone in the U.S. died, they would then proceed to hate Europe, then Australia.\"\"I think that the event is a tragedy and never should have happened. Nothing can be given or said that would justify such actions. Having said this, and with understanding that the events did happen, the government\'s response is next at hand. To respond with the same force and in the same way would lower us below those who committed the same act. Not to mention the kickback from doing so. I think that justice needs to be done, but not  justice  in the way most Americans want. We need to recognize that violence breeds violence and most likely exacerbated violence. Feeding the flame and the reason to attack us again can not be the answer. Complete peace will not result from violence. We should seek out Benladin and let the judicious backbone of the country lead. He should be innocent until proven guilty and tried like any other human. Bombing innocent lives is not the answer, that\'s already been done in Afghanistan. The Muslim religious/political leaders have already stated that an attack on an Islamic country will be viewed as an attack on Islam. We shouldn\'t make things worse by being hasty and/or vengeful.\"Not much0\"Ben Ladin, not necessarily the Afghanistan government.\"',4,-4,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,3.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.38,0,0,0,0.79,1.59,0,0,3.18,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,0,0,22.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.59,3.17,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,0,0,1.59,0,13.48,2.38,0,2.38,0,0,7.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male49b
'No change\"At that time, I was watching an evening TV news. The program had just started, and the caster was confusing what was happening in New York. TV showed one of the twin tower was burning. In the next moment, the airplane hit the other building.     Since then, people talked about violence, which is out of our understanding. We have similar history in Japan during the World War II. Young Japanese men committed suicide bombing as a member of  Kamikaze . It was very quick that people forgot the reality of  Kamikaze  while the fact was left unexplained.    There is big difference between  Kamikaze  and September 11 attacks as well as similarity. I am not sure which is important. I may be wrong, but it seems to me clear that both Japanese and American people have to think about similar question. For Japanese, why were young people willingly to join  Kamikaze . For American people, what does Islam fundamentalism mean. Both are supported by spiritual purity and rigor whether more profoundly relates to religion or not.     Spiritual purity and rigor is grown up in a society where life is limited and political basis is immature. Political maturity requires economical, cultural and social development. It is uncertain that spiritual purity and rigor itself is a power for social development. It is certain that political immaturity makes the present condition worse.    \"some of Islam Fundamentalistsprotest to ignorance and povertyAmerica\"Disbelief, confusion, tears.\"Total frustrationNo change\"i ahve very mixed feelings, on the one hand i feel terrible for al those who lost loved ones either helping in the search for survivors, or those who came down with the building. on the other hand it is so hard to contemplate the fact that the twin towers are no more. i guess we all kind of took it for granted. our country was not at all prepared for this attack, this attack gave our country a taste of what israel goes through from day to day. the attack also brought america more together than ever, our country has shown more patriotism than ever.\"noneosama bin ladenhe is not happy witht the way our country is treating his peopleReligious brain-washingMuch more patriotic\"This is my perspective as a British citizen living in the U.S, a former New Yorker with friends and family in Manhattan. My first instincts were shock and disbelief - how could anyone do this? How could this happen on American soil?? How far have they gotten past our security? If they can do this to America what chance does the rest of the world stand? Then as realization set in it was sadness, worry about friends, fear about how safe we all are. Later I had feelings of anger and wanting to see justice done. Although a forgein national I felt immense pride at the way the nation acted: donations of blood and money, flag fling and general unity. Throughout all the stages I don\'t think the disbelief went away - that they COULD do this to us and they hated us so much as to carry it out.\"\"I believe it is an Islamic fundamentalist group, though bin Laden may be the leader he is not alone.\"It seemed to the terrorists to be a way to be heard.  \"I have received a great number of emails in response to an essay that I wrote regarding the attack. Most have been thoughtful, but one was particularly reactionary. I\'m sure that the writer was well-intentioned, but  blind nationalism is not what the US or the world needs right now. The  ideals we need now are freedom, self-determination and compassion, things that reflect our virtues, rather than our power, our  might  more than   right .  I have even heard calls for us to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons in  this war on terrorism. I do not take pride in the fact that the US is the only  country to have used nuclear weapons. Not just once, but twice, we did just  what the terrorists did last week, only on a much larger scale, wiping  out two entire cities and leaving many more people to suffer the horrible  effects of radiation. Advocates of the bombings on Nagasaki and Hiroshima  say that the attacks tremendously shortened the war and reduced American  casualties. Is it right to obliterate thousands of non-combatants without  a moment\'s notice?  The terrorists last week thought so, and the US  thought so when it bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I wonder whether we could have  ended the war just as effectively by demonstrating the power of the weapon  without killing an entire population. Maybe not, but I wish we had tried it at  least once. US policies in the middle east have undermined self-determination repeatedly. No  wonder we aren\'t universally loved. It doesn\'t help, either, when Bush refers to  this as a Crusade.  Even conservative commentator Chris Matthews (on  MSNBC) agrees that this is not what we need. What were the crusades? A war  initiated by Christianity against Islam as a whole. Is that what we want to do,  start a war against an entire religion? Is this what we, who live in a country  that takes pride in religious liberty, really want? No, we want to defend  ourselves against terrorists, and to further the rule of law throughout the  world. At least, that\'s what I want.  I have heard calls that the US needs to bomb Afghanistan into the dark ages,   bomb it to hell.  Sorry to be the bearer of disappointing news, but the Soviets  have alrady done that, and the ongoing civil war that has continued since the  Soviets left in 1989 has continued to ensure that the people there _are_ in the  dark ages, in hell.  Our nation\'s military leadership admitted as much when  they said that  there are no targets of great value  in the country. But more  importantly, if the US stands for the killing of innocent people, whether  by using nuclear weapons or through massive bombings of a people subjected to a  backward government that they didn\'t elect and don\'t want, well, then the US has  failed in its aspiration for liberty and justice for all. Like others, I am outraged, shocked, and horrified at the tragic loss that the  terrorists have perpetrated. I want justice. I want vengeance. But I want to  work with the rest of the world in order to achieve these ends. We condemn  vigilanteism among individuals. We need to recognize that the same principle  applies among the community of nations. Because of the attack at the World Trade  Center, there is hardly a country in the world that did not suffer a loss among  its population. Even Pakistan, no industrial power itself, has announced that  approximately 60-80 of its citizens are believed to have died in the attack. Our  victory over terrorism will be greater if we do not become vigilantes during the  fight. Working with the world community will ensure a more lasting victory. \"\"The proximal cause was the terrorists, who wish to  speak out against US policies. The distal cause was the US tendency to act in its own self-interest, and not to seek consistency between our lofty and laudable ideals on the one hand, and our actions that have been quite contrary to those ideals on the other hand.\"\"I\'m not sleeping as much as I used to or need to. I worry that my daughter will not live in a world that knows safety in the same sense that my world did. I feel  melancholic, and concerned that Bush will seek unilateral action when what we need is a broad coalition of support. So, for these reasons, I lose sleep.  I also make sure to tell my family that I love them when  I leave the house. Terrorists are unlikely to strike my small town, but my mortality is more salient to me now than before. I appreciate life, and want to share that with my family.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,0.74,0,8.94,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,0,2.98,8.94,0,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.47,2.98,0,8.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.95,5.21,4.47,0,0,0,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,1.49,Male49b

My deepest thoughts are first about my emotions as I heard about it: blank surprise, horror, connection with what people may have felt at the time of Pearl Harbor or in race riots of the past. Those deep thoughts also run to how people will react, with anger, distrust of others in the world, the desire for revenge without knowing the big picture of what has been going on in parts of the world that lets some people take exactly the wrong angry plan to hurt us.\"\"they\'ve been hurt, they feel powerless, they get a power trip and validation by doing something violent\"that\'s exactly what I think is not well known and that premature answers have been used -- the use of  secret information  for public debate is tricky!I realize how little things dont really matter after you have seen something like this.I think that the terrorist attacks were a horrible act that have to  be avenged.

'no changeOsama bin Laden\"Range of emotions. Initially stunned at the unreality of it all. There was a definite wow factor about the spectacular pictures we were  seeing. The initial \'thrill\' was replaced by both sadness for the  victims and rage at the perpetrators,and, it has to be said, great  antipathy towards islam and all it\'s adherents. So much so that was  quite willing for US govt to launch immediate strikes against whoever  they felt was responsible (Normally, I would consider myself more of a dove than a hawk). As the days have passed this feeling of rage has subsided somewhat.  Not so sure bombing Afghanistan to damnation will help. Throughout it all I have been soaking up any information from tv  and the newspapers trying to get a handle on what happened and also because it is the only thing that everyone has been talking about. Even though I was not directly invovled in this event (I was thousands  of miles away, I know none of the victims), I took it personally. \"out of a warped sense of injusticeEverybody.\"I feel like everyone should be nicer to each other, chill out, and quit acting on hate.\"\"They had motive, beliefs that cater to this action, and opportunity.\"\"I think it\'s sick that people could do that to other people -- kill ordinary folks going about their day.  But I also think the U.S. has to figure out why those involved committed such violent acts.  That is, there is all too likely some sort of motive and the U.S. should quetion its relations such as foreign policy.  Of course, even if our foregin policy is so oppressive to those people I do not think killing U.S. citizens is a rational and useful strategy for overturning whatever negative components of U.S. policy, society, or culture angers or oppresses those people.  We may need to rethink ourselves, and those involved, if they are indeed Islamic, may need to reassess jihad.  The Islamic community may also need to label the perpretrators of these events as a  cult  and not a typical representative of the religion.  Although I question the U.S., I also question the terrorists and am hurt by it.  It has birthed a new sense of patriotism within me as well as a sadness and a feeling of real vulnerability.\"\"What can I say, the media has said, it must be Bin Laden. I truly think the people who flew the planes were a group of people that did it on their own, but there may have been links too Islamic extremism\"\"Frustrated with the world, its about time that we should be able to make the best world as possible.   getting aware of the power of the media, in any country.\"\"They are truly brainwashed.. the terrorists.  Do not kill innocent people in uS hunt for terrorists. But do prosecute the correct people that did this cruel act. Fight terrorism. US interferance in international affairs, in all cases, can be somewhat provocative. That goes for commercials, movies as well as being too much of a  world police  etc. I believe, from my perspective, that americas strenght is too much for poor countries that are struggling with politics and religion. \"\"Frustrated with US helping of military forces that kill their families. They are disoriented. Sad, but true,  black and white thinking . Can\'t help it.  Too much TV \"\"I\'m interested in telling you my perspective but I\'ve been a bit overwhelmed with the attack and the media newscoverage ao I\'m not sure where to begin. First I\'m angry. I\'m angry at the lax security measures that weren\'t in place, I\'m angry at the fact that we have known  suspected  terrorists in our country which weren\'t deported, I\'m angry at crazy religious fanatics, I\'m angry at the politicians who are using this as an excuse to gain the media spotlight, I\'m angry at the airlines - the money grubbing SOB\'s they are. They don\'t want to spend money on security and now they lay off thousands of employees and get our tax dollars to keep them afloat...and the list goes on and on. AND I\'m angry at the media coverage. I\'m angry at the blood-lust that American\'s have for revenge....Thank god we didn\'t go over there with guns blazing and kill so many inocents - what good would that do. Where does my anger end? The other thing is that I\'m quite shocked how much this event has affected me. I\'m presently writing a disseration and freaked out anyway over the deadlines and then this happens and takes me totally off track. I haven\'t slept well since it happened...and I know it\'s because of the attack because I dream about it every night - not nightmares but general  processing  dreams, like if I were in charge I would do such and such...I\'m glued to the T.V. Plus I\'m going to NYC for a conference in a couple of weeks and I\'m concerned over what that will be like. I\'m basically unsure exactally how I feel...other than I\'m angry...I want revenge too but not at the cost of killing innocents and going to war. I don\'t want to be in fear of traveling...I\'m tired.\"Just watching too much television.I have never quite understood the religious fanatic mentality. It is so hard to understand. Could someone be so psycholocially warped that they would do something like this? I want to read about the psyche of such individuals. Pretty scarry what religion - and probably classifiable mental defect can do to someone.\"This is an interesting question...at first glance it would be Ben Landen, but on a deeper level is it our US policy regarding Israel and the Middle East? I haven\'t followed our countries policies and histrical dealing in the Middle East but it\'s a vicious cycle when American get involved in such conflict between religious factions. But definately more fault on the actual terrorist group that did it.\"\"well i told all of my family that i loved them more often, and i try to take advantage of every day because you will never know when it will be your last\"because they are jealous of our country and how it is run\"When i first heard the news about the attacks, i was sitting in my  introduction to humanities  class with my classmates. we were waiting for out teacher to arrive, but by 9:50, people were beginning to leave. around that time, one of my classmates got a two way page on their nextel, and somebody told him that the twin towers were attacked. he shared the news with the rest of us. we reacted in shock and disbelief.  the counselor finally came to the class to tell us that classes were cancelled because our teacher lives in manhattan and couldnt make it.  mamy of us stood behind to talk about what had happened, many of us sad, scared, shocked and concerned.  after our discussion, i went to the computer lab to see the news, and to check my email. i was flooded with phone calls and instant messages, i felt so loved.  on my way home, the buses were packed, because the trains were closed. the bus was silent, and people looked shocked.  when i got home i watched the news for the rest of the day, and the following day. i was in such shock and disbelief still.  the events that occured on september 11th, 2001 will be forever burned into our memories. i was deeply affected as were my peers, eventhough many of us hadn\'t lost someone we love. i was shocked, saddened, angry and upset. my heart goes out to everyone who was affected, and people who lost family members. it is truly a tragic and senseless act. \"bin laden',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.97,0,0,0.74,0,12.64,0,1.49,0,0,0,2.97,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,20.07,0,0,0,1.49,1.49,0,0,4.46,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0.74,0,62.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,67.67,6.69,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,29.75,5.2,12.64,0,1.49,0,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,0,1.49,1.49,Male49b
'Perverted religous convictionsOsama Bin Laden\"I feel that we were caught unprepared.  The US was fully aware of the global and national threat of terrorism.  However, the attacks were allowed to occur.  I also feel a sense of strength instead of despair or fear because of the events of Sept. 11th.  The US and some sort of unified international military force will overcome terrorism and the groups and individuals responsible for the attacks on NY and DC will be punished accordingly.  We are a peolple of many differences, but when we are threatened we don\'t scatter and run, we come together and fight with a resolve similar to the  Rath of God .\"none.\"I really cannot comprehend how someone could justify after meticulous planning taking so many people\'s lives.  then again, I would rather go to gaol than serve in any form of armed forces.\"\"This is very complex.  I think the U.S. has to take some responsibility.  I have put this first as they are the only people so far that we definitely know what level of responsibility they are at, certainly not because they are most responsible. The U.S has a foreign policy borne out of \'what\'s in it for me?\'  This is shown in their call to allies,  You\'re either with us or against us  not  let\'s make this world a better place.   By promoting themselves as a religious state to an extent and by encouraging forms of terrorism (Northern Ireland, Nicaragua, abortion centres) often at a government level, there are ways that the U.S government  could have avoided such an attack.  Their recalcitrance at the United Nations when something does not benefit them is not unnoticed around the world (Kyoto protocol, U.S war criminals not legally bound to trial by an international court).  The perpetrators that did this obviously take the most part of the blame.  They planned it, showed complete disregard for human life, and deliberately left us in a confused state to ensure the continuation of violence.  There is no excuse for this type of attack, even though other parties may have to share some responsibility.  If the attackers were from Iraq, then the matter is a little simpler.  The U.S is at war with them, and while Iraqi citizens know what that feels like I don\'t think U.S. citizens do.  I think that the U.S would be wise to begin a strategy of negotiation with Iraq considering that they, and any other country for that matter, will always be vulnerable to violence and destruction.\"\"The only thing is I\'ve been much nicer to my flatmate, who is from Louisiana\"\"First of all, like everyone else I was shocked and horrified by what happened and had nothing but sympathy for the people who knew someone that had died.  I think it would be very difficult not to feel that way. My personal reaction was not one of anger though.  I feel that if you are so hurt by what someone else has done to you then you wouldn\'t consider doing the same thing to someone else.  Even though the attack was  unprovoked  I still feel acting in revenge is philisophically no better than acting out of cold blood.  Self-defence is another matter entirely. Further on this point, this should have alerted people to attrocities occurring elsewhere in the world.  Understanding of the complexities in Palestine, Northern Ireland, Serbia and other places may in fact require you to go through something similar.  Unfortunately the world doesn\'t see this, it seems to be conveyed as \'a new terror\', something that we\'ve never encountered before.  The reality, in my opinion, is that we\'ve seen this terror on countless occassions through history and it has continued endlessly at times.  This has to be realised as we consider our next actions, as the last thing we want to do is be responsible for creating a \'cycle of violence\'.\"Aside from attending vigils and calling family members I can\'t think of any.\"There are direct and indirect contributers? The most obvious answer and most direct contributers were the men who chose to hijack the planes and kill themselves and others. There are the others who helped plan, coordinate, and finance the attack. I think many individuals and countries bear indirect responsibility (e.g., middle east governments that terrorize their peoples, our governtment for directly and indirectly supporting those governments), though i\'m not sure. There is definitely a part of me that resists acknowledging that any life condition could justify what the most direct contributers did.\"\"As most Americans, I was truly shocked and disgusted by the events. My initial reaction was disbelief followed by confusion ( what does this mean? ) and then fear ( our country, my life is unsafe ). These reactions occurred in a span of 10 seconds or so. After it settled in (say within 10 minutes), my next reaction was anger and i had a strong sense of wanting revenge. These were coming from deep within, my uncensored reaction, about which I felt some guilt or at least a sense that these were probably not the most productive feelings to have. Over the last several days, my feelings have become more ambivilant. At times, especially over the next few days, I felt a strong sense that our country needed to respond and that a military response was the only reasonable way to address it (even though I am mostly opposed to war and violence). My reasoning behind these thoughts were mostly practical; eg. we needed to respond in some way, and I didn\'t think violence would provoke more violence b/c I had a sense that terrorists would continue to attack our country regardless of whether we responded aggressively or not. I also became aware of this sense of arrogance about our country\'s power. Even though the events of Tuesday made me feel vulnerable to terrorism, it didn\'t make me feel vulnerable to losing  a war (ie I was underestimating the risk of a violent response b/c I had a strong sense that we would  win  any war. At the same time, I have been exposed to much info (like Frontline on PBS) that took a more balanced view of reasons for the attack, namely us policies in the middle east. while acknowledging this did not justify the attack or even reduce my anger about it, it did prompt me to comtemplate the importance of other reactions to it. I have not had strong negative reactions to individuals (eg bin Laden), just to the act. I remain very angry about it, and I have started to buy into the idea of good vs. evil. By that I mean, while I am sympathetic to the life conditions that have cultivated terrorist mindset and that in some ways it is inevitable perhaps of our own making, it is not a reasonable/acceptable response. Terrorism offers no solutions to the world\'s problems. Do people who adhere to that mindset truly believe that the world would be a better place if they were in power? Civilization would not exist if they were. I only wish people devoted half as much time to improving the world as they do to destroying it. I would also like to send them information on Ghandi and Martin Luther King\'s methodolgy of passive resistance. Such methodology is not only more creative and humane but also more successful in changing our world in productive ways. \"\"Desperation (they may have perceived it as the only solution), selfishness (ensuring themselves of an afterlife in their worldview; or increasing their personal power). I haven\'t ruled out the possibility of mental disorder, certainly a lack of empathy for human suffering.\"\"Because they are fucked in the head, and their religion and culture apparently includes the murder of innocent people.\"\"Arabs.  Plain and simple.  As everyone tries to be PC and say only a few Arabs are responsible, I feel the attitude in that part of the world is very anti-American and is a direct threat to all of us.\"\"I\'m more pissed off at other countries.  I cherish more what we have in the U.S., and being in the USMC I want to go to war and get revenge.\"\"I will never, ever forget that day.  I was standing in front of the TV at work (I\'m in the Marine Corps).  We all felt so hopeless.  Here we are trained to defend the country, and all we could do was watch!  It was so very frustrating.  The stories that came out later of people talking to their wives or husbands from the planes, etc...were hearbreaking. It was such a sickening feeling I had when I saw that second plane hit live on TV.  I called my dad that night and cried on the phone.  I\'m 25 years old, and I was crying!  That\'s a big thing for me.  My sister\'s fiance is an EMT in NYC, and she was going crazy trying to hear from him.  He ended up being ok, but pulled many bodies out of the area that day in the couple days after the attack.  I went to Wallmart the night of Sept. 11 and purchased a big American flag that I now fly proudly from my the front of my home. I love this country so much, and it\'s about time people realized what we have and how quickly it can be taken away.  \"\"I think that what happened during sept 11 was wrong.  the united states never did anything to conjour this conflict with Osama.

People who do terriosim should be killed regardless of who and where they are.  He even got many of the Afhgan people to help out which i think is totally wrong.  Bush is doing a GREAT job, but i don\'t think he should be sending the people of afghan any food or substanence.  we should just bomb it and be over with the fight.  i am from the military and i think that everything that was done deserves an end.  we should kill all terroists and people who harbor them.\"osamathey are jealousbeen the same.. but more against terroism and cowardice',3,-5,0,2,5,2.28,1.14,0,0,0,0,1.14,1.14,0,0,0,0,3.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.86,1.14,0,0,0,1.14,0,2.29,1.71,0.57,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,24.57,0,1.72,0,0,1.14,0,1.14,0,31.43,2.29,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,0,1.14,0,0,0,0,0,13.72,6.86,2.29,2.29,1.14,0,1.14,0,1.14,0,0,0,0,0,2.29,0,0,0,Male49b

How to deal with this? Their religion trumpeted their superiority. Ah, the West must be evil. They ignore their own lack of fundamental freedoms and enslavement of women.

It became very real to me - and embodied as fear and shock - though the effects were not felt until a few days later.  I had a major gastric upset, which stopped me sleeping. I was majorly worried that someone as apparently stupid as Bush would over-react in a macho aggressive way.  I was impressed that he did not - at leat until now.  Blair\'s positioning is something I\'m not sure how I feel about. I find the cynical attempt at humanitarian aid a distasteful gesture. But I\'m worried also what will happen afterwards.

These feelings were broken by brief periods of anger and shame at how some Americans were reacting with  statements like \'nuke the arabs\' or even calling the terrorist\'s acts the most evil act done.  This pales to the Holocaust. My feelings for Americans have become more negative because they still don\'t get it-- that much of the rest of the world does hate us, and that we deserve to be hated by some people. But I also feel increased prejudice towards Arabs who believe crazy ideas like the  Jews did it. I knew there were fanatics in Arab lands, but I was surprised at how educated Arabs could hold such views. I still have a hard time imagining what it must be like at ground zero. Despite the media coverage (which was graphic, scarey, and vivid), people who have been there  say it doesn\'t really capture the magnitude of the event.

'\"i personally believe that the events that took place on sept. 11 were very tragic and dreadful. I personally believed that satan came to this country and caused all the chaos and destruction in this country. Also personally i think that even though Bin laden and his members are blamed for this, i dont think we should blame the views of islam on this. Being a Hindu and having a lot of friends that chose that religion, i understand where they are coming from. I think that religion is always used as a scapegoat for almost everything that happens in this world. I think that we should stop using religion and try using our brains for once and see where the true evil lies. Bin laden being muslim doenst me that all muslims are evil too. Actually most of my friends are angry at bin laden himself for using the name of islam and proving his point. They are all sorry for what has happened in this country and it\'s citzens. In the end i just want to say that we should open our minds to all religions and try to learn the truth about everything before judgking anyone based on their religion.\"Anyone and everyone that supports terrorism not only bin laden and his alliesThey haven\'t changed dramatically but i have opened my heart and mind to other religions and i am trying to learn as much as possible about them.To prove to others that evil can win over good but that is not true.Ideology\"It was a criminal act...murder, and should be treated as such.

At first I thought this was an Israel based thing, but increasingly I\'m thinking that it is an issue, potentially, at least of culture conflict...these people basically want to destroy the west as it presently exists for ideological reasons. I read evolutionary psychology and am aware of the literature on the psychological bases of war, etc etc;  but I\'m afraid that our evolved psychologies are directed toward physical attack, not the kind of  twilight  war that is required here....while the other side can go ahead and do its physical attack thing far more readily.

'I feel I\'m more aware or alert to events around me. I don\'t sleep much and I would rather watch the news than the Simpsons. I attend alot of sporting events and every time the American Anthem is sang my eyes fill with tears.   \"I can\'t believe this happened on American soil.  My heart goes out to the families and friends as well as the rest of the world that was effected by the monsterous acts which occured on Sept. 11th 2001. That week I maybe slept 3 hours.  I was glued to the TV.  I could not decide if I was dreaming or watching the longest horror movie of all time.  I wanted to go to NY to help out.  The wierd thing is I felt like NY was just across town.  In reallity it\'s miles from Nebraska.  We could all feel the pain. Every emotion a person could feel was felt.  Good luck finding an American flag anyware.  Being from NE, it\'s very common to see thousands of people walking the city wearing red and white.

I feel very deeply for everyone who was affected by these events, but only when I am confronted with their faces and voices directly; I don\'t dwell on the pain when I am not immediately encountering pain. I believe that we are all here to co-create our existence together--the good, the bad, and the ugly. U.S. policies throughout the world has created resentment and anger directed toward us; there is no doubt of that in my mind. Now a relatively small group of people have created anguish and outrage in the U.S. and with our allies. How very interesting. Those terrorists had as much right to create terror as we did to create beneficial economic and military policies in other countries, and we have every right to retaliate against their actions, as well. However, I guess I am in the 10\% minority of people who do not approve of the way George W. Bush has handled the situation. I agree that the U.S. cannot let such actions go unpunished, but when he got up in front of Congress and said that the reason they hate us is because they hate  freedom  and  American values , he was either lying, or just too dumb for words. If they hated freedom, why don\'t they bomb the Red-Light district in Holland, where people are much freer and heathenistic than we are? If they hate affluence, then why don\'t they bomb Switzerland, where they enjoy a higher standard of living than we do here? Why doesn\'t Osama bin Laden say,  We will kill every American, Jew, and Canadian we find ? Because that\'s ridiculous. Bin Laden and his kin have expressed their legitimate greivances to the world in a way that finally cannot be ignored by anyone, but he was forced to do it in a way that will ultimately lead to his own destruction. Once that\'s accomplished, I hope we\'ll get a president who understands that we live in a community of nations that expects to be heard when they speak to us. In the end, however, nations come and go, empires rise and fall, and the U.S. will not prove to be any different. Perhaps this is the beginning of the end for a powerful, beautiful, if imperfect nation of freedom-lovers and entrepreneurs.\"\"Because they are small yet proud, and determined not to let the U.S. treat them as if they are small and insignificant.\"None.Cancelled travel plans.

These moments deliniate the times before from the times after, and I am certain that times will never be the same. I regret that this is the world my children will know. Simpler times are something that we all long for - the days of  Father Knows Best  and  Andy Griffith  Simpler times and innocence are lost. We know now that we will never be safe in the same way that we know we will pay taxes. I am also angry at the perpetrators of this cowardly act of violence. While I don\'t advocate war or violence, I know that we must ensure that this will not happen again. Let those that are responsible know that these acts are not the best means to their ends. Whatever decisions are made by our government to ensure our future safety must be supported.\"A deep seeded hatred of America based on religious fervor.I am more aware of what is important in my lifeOsama Bin Laden\"Because they are full of hate, and they think that it will begin a  holy  war\"It\'s the most horrible shocking thing I have ever been witness to.\"After the first few hours, I became really angry with the networks for showing the crash over and over ad nauseum.  Its like they didn\'t care how painful it was for all those thousands of families whose loved ones were dying before their eyes and knowing how all of us wanted to know more news and information about the situation, they took advantage of us and made sure the purient voyerism in all of us came out.  Enough already. I can see the point of showing film or video when illustrating a point of helping people understand what happened but to use that same film of the second plane striking tower 2 over and over in the background for every new interview or new piece of information was over the top in the worst sense.  I believed it a ploy by someone to inflame the American public as much as possible. I read the special Newsweek edition today about the tragedy and cried through most of it.  Its all so terribly sad and I feel such loss as a person of this country.  To know how many thousands of moments of love have been wrenched from the lives of so many people, makes me shake my head at the willingness of men to die for such an atrocity.  Whatever their reasons none of them can justify it to me. It was hatred of America and Americans and our way of life; that is the bottom line.  These men held religious motives as the basis for their actions. So did the Nazis and every other group whose has perpretrated such horrors on humanity. They are not different.  They are just a crazy as the next bunch that allows religiosity to justify any thing no matter how horrible or how inhuman.  I have been very religious most of my life and from a personal stand point most of the worst decisions I have made came from that source; religiosity not religion.  I believe the same about these men and those who lead such men and those people who follow such leaders.  We stand at a crossroads as a nation whether to surrender our freedoms in order to be safe or whether to have freedom and all the dangers it entails.

I was deflated for several days and had difficulty doing any work or taking any significant action. By Wednesday, I began to get really angry at those responsible for the attack (although I still don\'t know who they are). For the first time in my life, I felt a sense of patriotism so strong that I entertained thoughts of joining the military to assist in the hunt for the perpetrators and aid in the retaliation. I know that I will follow these events in the news and through friends in Washington DC more so than any other event that has occurred in my life. I feel deeply saddened for the victims, their families and friends, and angry at those who would support this type of attack. At the same time, I\'m angered at those AMericans who would aim their rage at those innocent individuals in our country and others who might be of the same race or religion as our attackers.\"\"Middle Eastern terrorists- maybe a group associated with Osama Bin Laden, but also maybe a group associated with Saddam Hussein\"Because they have felt that Americans have been attacking and injuring their innocent for yearsI spend a lot more time discussing current events The actual planners died in the act -- they were very likely sponsored and encouraged by the Al-Quaida network as charged.\"One thought during the event itself was that a historical perspective was of great comfort: realizing that the identical feelings of helpless outrage were felt by, among many, many others: The British during the Blitz as German bombers nightly destroyed buildings and lives; and citizens of Beirut in one decade, and of Sarajevo in another, as daily mortar fire reduced their beautiful cities to unlivable wreckage. Since the event I have felt strongly that if some of my fellow Americans had a bit more historical sense, they would not go quite so far overboard in their reactions. A second thought is that this has been a very valuable lesson in the power of fanaticism. We have not had to deal with true fanaticism since WWII when the Kamikaze pilots were giving their lives to attack our ships in the Pacific. The fanatic who is genuinely willing, even eager, to die in his (always his) cause is enormously effective and impossible to defend against. Hopefully we will realize as a nation that the only effective prevention is to reduce the conditions that foster fanaticism. A third thought in the aftermath is: what a wonderful education this has been for the Bush administration -- a group that seemed dead set on an isolationist course, abrogating treaties left and right, that suddenly has had to turn 180 degrees and become internationalists. It seems likely that this will carry over into other areas of foreign affairs. \"none\"To make a vivid public demonstration of their rage and to symbolically damage the source, as they saw it, of great evil.\"Misunderstanding of American involvement in the Arab nations.\"The members of the society that has attacked our great nation (whether they be Afghan, Arab, Muslim, or whatever) obviously wanted to upset us.

I hate their people, I hate their culture, I hate their religion, and I hate eveything. Becuase of their hellish onslaught on my homeland, they have created a new enemy. I was completely OK with Islam up until this terror strike. But they have willingly changed my opinion on every Muslim and Arab I see. Is that really what they wanted?

Add this to its unstinting support for Sharon, the most inflammatory Israeli premier for years and its not difficult to see how extremist elements within the Arab world can attract support.

Yet if there is one silver lining in this, its that it may shock the US out of its introspective attitude and make it engage more with the rest of the world.

The world\'s most beautiful skyline was destroyed. All in the name of islam (or rather somebody\'s twisted notion of islam). This is not the first strike, nor will it be the last. To this date 10,000 Indians were killed in Kashmir.  Bombay was rocked by a serial bomb blast in the 90\'s where 600 people died. All the evidence points back to Pakistan and Afganistan.

The president Bush said, This is the action of war.  and I really support his words. Any attaks caused more than 6000 people`s death should be called war... In Japan most of the people carefully watched the TV at that night. When I first time heard the news by the informational service of my mobile phone, I was on the train to be back my home. Then I didn`t feel anything..., because the news was too shocking to beleive in.  Because some of my friends were in NY and i had been to USA before.

On one hand, deep anger and outrage at this massacre of innocents, compassion for the victims and their families, a special feeling for New York which I\'ve always enjoyed as a special and unique place.  Some wonderful stories of compassion amongst people who are supposed to be cynical and self-absorbed.  The heroism of firefighters and rescuers is to be admired.  I\'m haunted at times by images of those planes and those towers, and frightened at the possibillity of biochemical warfare (that your Pentagon has developed and refined over the years). On the other hand, I\'m deeply disturbed over the nationalistic orgy that this has aroused.  I do agree with the basic policy of a protracted war against this profound threat, and my country has joined in the effort.  I am satisfied to see that, for whatever reason, your President has disassociated himself from the redneck backlash against people of other ethnicities and nationalities. However,  I see very disturbing signs of unreason at a time where it is most needed. Dissent is virtually nonexistent in your mass media (look at CBC and BBC WEbsites for some perspective).  You treatment of many other countries has not been altruistic; for example, see Christopher Hitchins\' two-part series in Atlantic magazine on Kissinger as a war criminal.  It has passed notice that September 11 is also the anniversary of the 1973 coup in Chile, supported by your CIA.  I see, once again, this utter stupidity of believing that the  enemy of my enemy is my friend , forgetting how you armed Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden in other times.  Righteous anger is fine, but not self-righteousness. And, the  world  has not changed.  Such statements betray a provincialism that is the despair of your friends.  You (and we) have joined the rest of the world.  Europe, Latin America and Israel have lived for decades under the threat of terrorism.  We live in a world that is more dangerous that we were willing to believe.  I fear that you will sink into a paranoia reminiscent of McCarthyism in response.  Then America also becomes frightening.\"I\'m more reflective.  Spend more time in prayer and appreciation for what I have.I only know what is in the news.

'\"I am distressed that I am in the middle--cognitively and morally--in some ways. The attack was unmitigated evil--period, period. And as an American I want to believe that we will prevail. But both liberal and conservative comments are short-sighted. 1. Radical Islam has more support than we want to believe--the Saudis  support it to save their own skins even if the top folks live lives  that are not compatible with it. 2. Our society has become the cultural opposite of the ideals of Islam  and the ideals of Christianity. Chuck Colson\'s comments to the  world religion conference in 1993 described the USA and western in  general beliefs in (a) goodness of humanity and denying evil in  ourselves (we are all victims, never villians), (b) human nature can be perfected by governments (not recognizing that 20th century governments have  killed more of their own citizens that have been killed in wars), (c) moral \\ values are relative (we are urged to tolerate, nay, affirm anything),  and (d) radical individualism and consumerism. These views corrode all faiths. The west has sought to cut the tie between our culture and Christian  faith--forgetting the our freedoms are possible only through internal restraint. Does our culture have the guts to confront radical Islam? I am apprehensive.\"They hate the western life style.Radical Muslims\"I am apprehensive of the future.

The following sunday I went to my church youth group, and when I came home I just started to cry.  I had this deep burden kind of feeling on my chest the entire week and I just broke down.  About a week after the event, I started to become angry at the ignorance my fellow Americans were showing by harrassing, vandalizing and persecuting people of Arab descent.  I am a firm believer in equal rights to all and these people who said they were doing it out of patriotism need to read our country\'s constitution.  I now feel as though it was just a dream and that it wasn\'t real when I look back on the tragic event\"Look at the bigger picture before looking at the smaller picture\"Before the disasterous September 11 morning my thoughts were directed towards my  college experience and my friends.  After the monumental day my perspective on life  changed the way i view others inside this country.  My views became narrowed on  seeing everyone who looked the same as the suspected terrorist of the events.  Then  after a couple of days of acting irrational i settled down and told myself, the acts  were of only one group of people just as those of the KKK.  After telling and reconciling myself i am trying to figure out why people act in ways to hurt others.   I don\'t think people who act in terrorist ways are rational when flying planes into  buildings or holding anti-american protests.  From an early age these people learn to hate by their guardians until the ideas of hate are burned into their minds.  So i feel sorry for everybody in the world for experiencing hate for it is not a rational state of mind.  \"Radical Americans mixed with sub-groups of outside terroristsIrrational thinkingThey are taught to hate instead of LoveI am afraid of what will happen next.

'not at allNo other choicesIn the long run the USA\"The terrorist attacks were upsetting and distressing but also showed how small man is against the forces of nature. Compared to what an earthquake of some magnitude might have done (and has done in Turkey, China etc.), or the floods in Bangladesh, the loss of life was quite small.

No religion should condone mass indiscriminate slaughter.  For the terrorists to wrap themselves in the veil of religion is disgusting. The loss of life is terrible and disheartening.  Words can\'t describe the collective shock. To those who say  everything has changed,  particulary about their personal safety, I say  what planet have they been living on?  Nothing has changed.   We are no more or less safe than before 9-11.  To those who lived through the apocalyptic imminent nuclear incineration possible during the cuban missle crisis this is much less fear inducing.  Anyone who lived through the Cold War and potential mutual assured destruction phase of foreign policy is deluded or uninformed if they think anything is different now in terms of personal safety.  This is a failure of American education or a case of mass cultural blinders. I hope I\'m wrong, but I fear our leaders are also blind to the abyss they have entered in starting a hot war in Afganistan.  Throughout history that region of Central Asia has swallowed attackers.  Worse, it has resulted in the defeated invaders returning home to see their civilization self destruct in its aftermath.  Britain and Russia\'s spheres of influence policies in Central Asia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to their rabid hate for each other up to during and after WWI and WWII and directly influenced the creation of the Middle East we know today and the Cold War.  It was the failure of those policies that led to the current statelessness in Muslim countries.  With no nation with which to identify, Muslims identified first as Muslims, and their poverty, powerlessness and inability to better themselves led to radical fundamentalism.  Does anyone in our Government have any sense of history. America wins big, total wars.  We have lost every guerilla war we ever entered.  What makes anyone think this will be different.  All we are doing is guaranteeing that the state of life in Israel (terror, bombings, etc) will be the state of life here now. Sept 11 shows the spnelessness and failure of our energy policy.  Instead of pursuing alternative energy self sufficiency to allow us to be independent of oil in Asia and the Middle East we have created an addiction governing or collective behavior as insidious as the heroin from that region. The towers should be rebuilt, perhaps even bigger as an defiant response. The reflexive response of abundant display of flags and wrapping ourselves in the symbols of America is nauseating and meaningless.  Taking refuge in the flag, or group religion, is deluding ourselves and arrogant and elitist.  Militaristic bravado is what Japan had before WWII. We need to educate and ameliorate the life and conditions of the NEXT generation in the Middle East and Central Asia in order to reduce terrorism.  We have already lost this generation.  India is a stable non-terrorist state today because Britain was there for generations.  Are we willing to stay in Central Asia for 2 or three generations (75 years)?\"\"I am reading more history, and planning fewer personal and business trips\"Islamic Fundamentalists\"Because they have no other way of drawing attention to themselves, their believe their lives are worthless in the present and can achieve in the afterlife what they cannot achieve in the present\"',3,-5,0,2,5,0.8,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,1.6,0.8,0,1.6,0,5.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,6.4,0,0,0,4.8,0,0,0,0,29.6,1.6,3.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.8,4.8,0,4,0,0,0,4.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,11.2,4.8,0,0,0,1.6,0,0,0.8,0,0,0,0,4.8,0,0,0,Male49b
'Not much\"A group of ultra-radical anti-american people - while the US cannot get away from its role in this, the final responsibility is with the group itself\"\"I first heard about the events when my roommate, who was watching it all on TV back at the apt., called me at school.  The first thing I did after he talked to me was go to the dept. computer lab and try to look for more information.  All of the US news sites were overloaded, so I went to the Globe and Mail\'s (Canada) and the BBC\'s (UK) websites - then those became cumbersome.  Just as I walked back into the office, my roommate called again about the Pentagon and I was still not as much shocked as I was intrigued by it all.  Eventually, a TV was set up in one of the classrooms that wasn\'t being used, so we watched the events there.  I remember I just felt a very cold feeling all over when I saw the Towers collapse.  I had heard about the event and read about it on the net, but it was seeing the actual collapse on TV that really freaked me out.  I think from the time I saw the towers collapse and when I went to lunch was a little over an hour, but it felt like a day.  My friend and I went to lunch and just talked about how this was going to get ugly.  In fact, my whole day was consumed with thoughts of how the govt. would react to this - I was scared.  The clips of President Bush did not do anything to ease my mind.  In fact, his wooden dememanor and scripted speech just made me mad.  I\'m not saying I want to see him pound his fist and swear, but it just seemed like pandering to me.  The rest of the day was just me zoning out until I decided to call it a day at 3:00pm.  When I got back, I turned on the TV and watched for 5 straight hours - something I have never done.  It felt to me that the networks were just spinning their wheels waiting for the next super-newsworthy event to come on - that made me mad as well.  I remember when the networks did the first broadcasts of footage of the crash and collapse from people using videocameras.  One in particular was filled with swearing (i.e.,  holy fucking shit ,  jesus fucking christ ) and the anchor kept apologizing for the profanity and mentioned how, given the circumstances, decorum is not a priority.  The way I saw it - as I said to my roommate - if anything described the WTC collapse (and September 11 as a whole) in three words, it was holy fucking shit.  Overall, I\'m in this weird limbo - I understand it but I don\'t condone it.  The rampant jingoism and fairweather (poorweather?) patriotism makes me sick and helps me understand the whys of the event.  Now that we\'ve decided to bomb Afghanistan, my opinion is shifting even further away from the rah-rah majority - what did the average Afghani citizen do to deserve that?  I guess, to wrap up, it comes down to what I told my friend at lunch: this is far from over, and that\'s the worst part of all.\"\"To make a difference, to get a reaction, to  wake up  Americans\"Desparation.They really haven\'t.\"I\'m feeling strangely detached from all of this. My reaction seems to be something of a  life goes on  acceptance of the WTC tragedy, coupled with a sense that the United States has finally had to deal with something that millions of people have to deal with worldwide. Theree is a sense of destiny in this, I think, and I\'m not at all sure that I have any feelings about it beyond the sense of acceptance I mentioned before.\"\"I think we\'ll find that Osama bin Laden had a hand in it, but that ultimately, responsibility will for the WTC attack lies in a web of organizations and countries (including Sadam Hussein).  I _hope_ that the U.S. will also realize that the U.S.\'s previous foriegn policies have contributed to terrorism--both by failing to deal with the issues that gave rise to it, AND by failing to acknowledge it as a real threat.  (I in no way, however, believe the U.S.  deserved  what it got.)\"???AwfulI pray more.Hatred engendered by past events which left one feeling they had no other choice.Middle East foreign policy of the US the last 50 years\"IU am torn between the grief cause the deaths on September 11. I am concerned that past US foreign policy has resulted in such intense hatred from the governement and people of the United States. I am concerned that our government and most of the media is not looking at our inventory for causing such hatred. I am concerned that anything less than violent retailiation - war - is not acceptable to the present US government and a majority of the American Adults.  I am concerned that our economy/employment will go to a war base economy/employment - with billons being spent on war, war industry, military payrolls, military equipment and military research - at the expense of the American people.\"\"I have gotten less work done and felt closer to strangers that I see in grocery stores, or in random places.  I have been careful to be polite and kind with everyone.\"Islamic Extremists\"I feel personally touched by this event as no other atrocity that I has occurred in my lifetime has touched me.  I feel pain in my heart in every reflective moment and that occurs numerous time every day.   I have been surprised at this feeling inside of me.  In the last decade, I have been very aware of circumstances in which civilian populations have been made targets and have died in large numbers in Bosnia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Palestinian Territories and etc.  I have been outraged, angered, hurt, saddened by attacks on innocents.  But the feelings I had for the victims of Grozny or Chechnya had a degree of circumspection that I only now appreciate.  The attacks of September 11 are more immediate in my awareness and intrusive.  I am ineluctably grieved by these events.  I have been angered in the days since the attacks by the failure of leadership that I percieve in the President of the US.  In the hours and days since the attacks, the message from this person has only been a vague promise of revenge that is repeated like a mantra.  The problem of world terrorism is a complex one that has not gone away in many countries despite the dedication of numerous police and military resources.  In this case, we have no target and I fear that compelled by idiotic promises, this president will carry another generation of Americans into a ground war fought against an enemy that is illusory for ends that cannot possibly be achieved.

I also think that the focus on Bin Laden is a nice way to give a face to the attackers, instead of it being some unknown group out there.

'\"The attacks on Sept. 11th were both frightening and eye opening.  I was on my way to school with my girlfriend and we heard that New York was being attacked.  We were listening to Mancow so it seemed just like a joke at 1st.  Then we checked other radio stations and found out that the attack was real.  We walked into school and saw what was happening.  It was totally sir-real.  We completley lost our innocence that day.  Ever since then the world has changed and all you see on T.V. is terrorist this and terrorist that.  It sucks.  I know other countries have it way worse than us, but attacking us to make us realize that is ridiculious.  The whole arab holy war thing going on over there is so unlike here.

Alot more knowledgeable of the world news.I would guess that there is a generation of angry young Middle Eastern men who see very little hope for a better life for themselves and their countrymen under the status quo.  They probably don\'t have much to lose by committing suicide. \"There\'s more than enough responsibility to go around.  I do not wish to absolve the terrorists of responsibility for their actions.  However, I feel the greater responsibility lies with American corporations and their  employees  in government (that is, virtually all U.S. politicians), for their support for the indefensible actions of Israel, their systematic exploitation of most of the world\'s people, and their indiscriminate use of violence to maintain global inequality.  Of course, that means that the American people are also responsible, since we tolerate this behavior in our name.  \"\"I\'ve gone to two meetings and participated in live and e-mail discussions with people whose political views are similar to my own.  We primarily talked about the dangers facing the country, and how we might take action to halt the mindless march toward war. \"\"My first thoughts were about the victims--the kinds of suffering they must have experienced, and whether I knew any of them.  (I grew up in northeastern NJ, so this was a realistic possibility.) Since that time I\'ve experienced a lot of anger, not so much at the terrorists as at the U.S. government, the media, and my fellow citizens, for their jingoism and their failure to think seriously about the reasons for the attack.  I feel American prosperity is largely based on systematic exploitation of the resources and labor of poor countries.  Even worse is American foreign policy, which attempts to maintain these inequalities by military force.  I\'m troubled by the shallowness of most people\'s understanding of American foreign policy. I also want to add that I\'m fearful.  I\'m not sure our national leaders are competent to deal with the crisis.  I\'m afraid we\'re going to respond, as we have in the past, by killing large numbers of innocent people, which will of course help to recruit more terrorists, leading to a vicious cycle of increasing hostility.  We were  fortunate  that this attack was by mechanical means.  It\'s troubling to think about how easy it would be for a terrorist to smuggle a biological or nuclear weapon into a crowded area.   \"I try to break the fear that my wife has of the worldthird world countries/with leaders that have had a taste of capitilistic ways .predijuce\"I feel a bit lonely but most of all i feel angry.

Are we going to avenge our people with  an eye for an eye ? or will we change some of our ways to benifit the planet. We use over 50\% of the Earth\'s natural resources .

To explain the first word, I must tell you that I\'ve lived in Manhattan for a year (98-99).  Being Greek I was delighted to see how friendly the people were and how civilized.  I expirienced the feeling of meritocracy, politeness, justice and order.  I always thought that that city was the safest place on earth-that\'s why this attack was so shocking.  I needen\'t describe the feeling of horror and pain that filled my heart while watching the dissaster endless times on TV.  And then I had to call my friends who live there, to see...if they still live!   To describe the second word, I have to go back to New Yorkers in 1999 and look at their dark side.  There was also a feeling that people whould do anything for money-that the $100 bill was their God.  People there were minding their own business, so much that they were not  citizens  with the ancient Greek meaning of the word.Citizen- Politis  from  polis  the town and then politics-well I don\'t have to translate this one.  A citizens duty is to be involved in politics, in other words to have a saying for what his  polis  does because he is part of it and he forms its existence.  That\'s why we have elections.  And although Americans were involved and concerned with what was going on in their country, they had no concern of what was going on outside America.  Now the catch is that the US goverment has been a major player in the rest of the world since world war 2.  In numerous discussions about American foreign policy, the American people whould refer to their goverment as  they  not  we  showing a chasma between the  two  (when it should be one). America is too far away , I myself felt that America is a different world, so far away from the rest of it-like a different planet!  A world power is always going to have a lot of enemies and friends-it cannot stay nutral.  Being a major player demands participation in all games.  One of the enemies was crazy enough to commit this massaker of inocent people-people that can be critisized for one thing only:  Not being involved and concerned about their  Polis\'s  foreign policy.  That\'s where the bitterness comes from-such a shame! Coming to the third word, I\'m puzzeld.  I\'ve been watching CNN for 14 days.  There are discussions about what happend, how, where, when, who did it, what the conseqences are and what America and the rest of the civilized world is doing about it.  No one asked why.  And if someone did the answer was: crazy, fanatics, lunatics, non-human.  I will agree with that answer, but it\'s just not good enough. What we should do about it: Fight terrorism?-yes! Even if it takes a full scale war?-yes! American people being more concerned about foreign policy?-yes! Put justice before interest?-yes! Divert moneys from military budget into humanitarian budget?-yes! Finally I want to remind or introduce people to a golden rule:   What goes around comes around.

Through their unspeakable hatred and the wanton killing of innocent civilians, a network of extremists has forced themselves heavily onto our agenda.  We have to do something about this.  I have felt sad at least once every day since this has happened.  And I have also felt rage.  My first feelings of rage are at some of my own countrymen, because so many of us are blinded by a sense of superiority in our society of tolerance, that we cannot see straight to defend ourselves.  For years I have been saying that we should take the terrorists declarations of war and intent to slaughter us seriously.  As a country we somehow had to allow them this terrific success before we responded with any fortitude.  And some people are still spouting the same rhetoric about a  small band of fanatics  and that we should avoid any military operation that might hurt innocent civilians.  Has there ever been a military operation that did not risk hurting civilians?  As a country we need to consider that this kind of fantastic tolerance and passivity might be part of the problem, and that the people that preach it may be expressing a special kind of hate, directed at themselves or their country.  We have to unite and stand up for ourselves.  There is a saying,  fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.   I am afraid of the shame I will feel if we don\'t handle this with fortitude and determination.  \"A wide and well-financed international network of extremists who hate the United States people at a religious level.

The whole thing still feels unreal. That the perpetrators must be stopped from committing further acts is a foregone conclusion and one which is in no danger of being overlooked. I do not believe in punishing anyone or getting revenge.  Both seem to me to be unproductive, irrational responses   acceptable, perhaps inevitable in the immediate aftermath but completely bizarre after any thought. What we need most to do is to stop the behavior of the United States and international corporations which produces such fertile soil for the growth of terrorist monsters.  The desperate will lash out. The first thing I was taught many years ago in life saving class was that a drowning person will not see you as a rescuer but as someone to climb up on to get out of the water. We need to take the lead in a global  Marshall Plan  to pull the entire world out of poverty.  We can do it. According to the Worldwatch Institute,  A report in 1998 by the United Nations Development Programme estimated the annual cost to achieve universal access to a number of basic social services in all developing countries: $9 billion would provide water and sanitation for all;  $12 billion would cover reproductive health for all women;  $13 billion would give every person on earth basic health and nutrition; and  $6 billion would provide basic education for all.  These sums are substantial, but they are still only a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars we\'re likely to spend on the  war.  And these social and health expenditures pale in comparison with what is being spent on the military by all nations-some $780 billion each year.   http://www.worldwatch.org/alerts/011009.html Without doing something to improve the state of the world, we\'ljust succeed in making more martyr, driving more people into the insanity of acts like those of Sept. 11, and creating an even larger, more desparate environment in which they can flourish. \"\"Immediately, bin Ladin and that crew.

Be careful, however, that our righteous wrath does not spill over and affect those individuals of peaceful Muslim denominations or Arab ethnicity. And that was really all I felt, till I got a sympathy e-mail from my friend Adisa. It wasn\'t the first expression of support I\'d had, but there was something especially painful about this one that made responding to it a heartrending experience, something that not only made me cry but brought me to a point of literal physical pain.

'\"Men who value power, and their arrogance once they\'ve achieved it (on both sides).  These type of men have  been causing death using others\' willingness to kill  and die since history began.  \"\"A small group of men filled with hate decided to kill as many people as possible in the most spectacular way possible, but to what end I am not sure.  It is not clear what they expected to happen as a result. By result I don\'t mean the death and destruction as a direct result of the terrorist acts, but the reciprocal retaliations that will occur into the forseeable future. This is the point at which I am unable to reason further.  I can  understand the hate, the frustration, the religious zeal.  I can\'t understand the desire to see any of the consequences likely to follow. The men were filled with hate for some good reasons.  The United States and its corporations have been exploiting the middle east since taking over from the British after WWII.  These men have seen the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people taken or ruined as the direct result of US policy and actions.  They have also seen the enrichment of the very types of people least deserving or reward, those who are  willing to sell out their brothers for money.  They also feel impotent  to do anything about it.   The mixture of hate, frustration, and a vengeful god who  rewards warriors makes for potent motivation. Having said that, it does not provide us with any bleeker outlook for mankind than has past history which is filled with one horrible event after another.  I don\'t expect to ever see peace on earth.  My deepest thought, that human life is devoid of meaning outside of ourselves,  we are driven by selfish desires mitigated by the need for companionship. All told, that does not pave the road to Nirvana.\"\"Hate, and an assurance that something greater than  themselves makes it righteous.  That can\'t be the whole story, because obvious reprisals and the  spector of cvilian casualties from a long series  of reciprical attacks, makes that reason impotent.

I suspect a Muslim fundamentalist group, backed by one or two foreign states, was responsible.\"\"A deep sadness coupled with a focused angered, tempered by the fear that many of our individual liberities will be needlessly diminished by laws enacted in haste in order to meet the public demand to  do something  about it.  Rather than focus our energies and efforts on taking the fight to our enemies, we will focus on security at home.  It is indeed ironic that the anti-freedom terrorists will have helped diminish freedom in the USA as we start unleash the government to conduct domestic spying on members of the public.  Remember Vietnam when those Americans who opposed the war were viewed as agents of foreign powers and infiltrated by the FBI?  The security organs and restrictions on liberites erected in haste will stay in place long after the threat from terrorism has been eliminated.  I am also appalled by the attacks on Americans of Asian heritage or Americans who follow Islam.  The lessons of the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during the Second World War have been forgotten by a lot of people.  I don\'t want you to get the idea that I am some kind of squishy liberal!  I support revoke the executive order against assassinating foreign enemies!  I support massive military strikes on those states which harbor or fund terrorists.  I believe in taking the battle to our enemies; not imprisoning ourselves in the name of security.  I feel as if the entire nation became one family on September 11th.  I have wept repeatedly every day since then.

But people still speed, drink and drive, and use their cell phones while driving.  What about the thousands of people that will die due to smoking or obesity related illnesses?

Yes, I was in NYC on the day of the attack.  I felt like I was in a movie, because the experience was so alien.  But, even from the outrageous imagination of Hollywood directors there has never been a movie as horrific as this reality!  The sophistication and  effectiveness  of the entire operation is mind-boggling.  Of course, the U.S. aims to preserve individual freedoms, which makes it somewhat easier for these things to happen. We are, in fact, often indignant when anyone encroaches on our personal freedom the slightest manner.  In airports, passengers routinely get hostile and aggressive because they are asked to go through a metal detector twice.  Things will be different now--in many ways.   On the day of the attack I was approaching NYC by commuter train.  As the train approached the city, a woman sitting across from me received a call on her cell phone.  She was talking very loud and annoying everyone around her.  When she got off of the phone, she announced that her husband called from downtown to tell her a plane had flown into the WTC.  My first reaction was that this was a terrible accident.  About 15 minutes later the train conductor announced that two(!) planes had crashed into the towers.  I immediately knew that this was no accident.  We all looked out the window from the train and witnessed the horrific scene.   When I got to NYC, I went to a scheduled meeting with colleagues mid-town NY, near Grand Central Station.  The reality and hugeness of this event had not yet set in psychologically I still felt compelled to go to a meeting and I did not feel uncomfortable being in Grand Central, even though it is an obvious target for terrorism.  On my way to my appointment, I was watching for reactions on the street and listening to my Walkman radio for news, but there was little information being provided.  Time seemed to stand still and to stretch into infinity.  The time span from 8:50 to 9:30 seemed like an entire day.   When I got with my colleagues, everyone was confused about exactly what to do.  Some people actually wanted to continue with the meeting as if nothing had happened.  (Denial is easy when the reality is so unbelievable!)  Others, including me, tried to get news to our family and friends to let them know we were safe and to find out whether they are safe.  This act was instinctual.  However, all cellular phones were not working and all other phone lines were jammed.  Amazingly, the Internet was still working and we were able to email some people.   My good colleague and friend, Tracey Revenson, lives in NYC, and her 6-year-old daughter, Molly, was at school 30 something blocks south of us and closer to  ground zero.   Tracey was naturally concerned and nervous, so we left to get her daughter.  It would be a long walk.  All subways were stopped and many of the streets were being closed down to allow emergency vehicles to get through.  The streets also became increasingly congested with pedestrians as business after business closed down, making it more difficult to get to our destination.  On this surreal walk in the direction of the disaster, we heard snippets of news from passersby on the street--a plane had struck the Pentagon, 8 hijacked planes were heading to various cities, like San Francisco and Chicago, etc.  Of course, some of this information turned out to be false, thank God.  On our way to Molly s school, we had intended to stop at the CUNY Graduate Center, to see if my class on  Urban Health  was canceled.  By the time we got the Graduate Center reality had set in deep enough for me to realize that there would be no classes that day, and if there were, I would not be teaching one.   The Graduate Center is across the street from the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue.  I was relieved to see the Empire was evacuated, because my sister-in-law works there.  The streets were getting increasingly crowded.  As Tracey and I looked down the Fifth Ave, there was suddenly a large poof of black smoke and everyone gasped the second tower had collapsed!  Incomprehensible.  Indescribable.  Unbelievable.  A chill ran through us all.  Tears flowed.  Many people just hugged one another.   Something about the towers actually collapsing made the full horror of the events set in.   With increasing urgency, we pushed through the crowds to get to the school.  On the way, we stopped at the building that houses the Disney Corporation, because Tracey s sister works there and we wanted to try to use a phone again.  I was still unable to reach my wife or parents.  Being in the Disney offices made the day even more surreal, because everywhere we looked there were hyper-happy characters Mickey, Minnie, Pluto beaming at us from posters and display cases.   To terrorists these characters probably symbolize American capitalism and oppression, but to me they symbolize comfort and joy, a flashback to the innocence and simple pleasures of early childhood an experience that I enjoyed and want my 3-year-old daughter Brianna to enjoy.  Being at Disney Corp flooded my mind with thoughts of Brianna, who was in pre-school in CT, some 40 miles away.  [I later learned that my daughter s pre-school, which is in the Jewish Community Center, was closed and armed guards were brought in because of fears of terrorist attacks.  Thankfully, nothing bad happened, but my wife was contacted and told that the school was closing.  She, of course, was in a terrible state her husband was in NYC, her father had flown to Washington DC on business that morning, her daughter s school was closing because of concerns of terrorism.]  We finally got to the school and retrieved Molly, who was physically ok.  However, Molly and her friends had all witnessed the events out of the window of their school.  Like all parents, Tracey began to wonder how she would explain all of this to her child in a way that she would still feel safe.  We then found Tracey s husband Ed on the streets, and their family was whole.  By then, it was only 11:30 am, but seemed much later.  I felt a strong need to get with my family.  Finally, I reached my wife Stefanie by phone.  She informed me that my parents were all right.  They had flown out of Logan that morning on a westbound flight United flight.  They were now on their way to Canada.  I was relieved to hear this, but also surprised because I thought they had flown out the day before.   I now needed to get to my home in Connecticut, but did not know how to get out of NY.  The City had been sealed, so nobody could enter.   A growing number of streets were closed and subway service was still halted.  There was limited train service at Grand Central Station, which could get me home, but it was not clear that the station was safe at that time.   I also needed to reach my sister-in-law, Meri, who lives on E. 26th Street.  Ordinarily it would take 20 mins to walk the mile to her house, but on this day it took an hour because there were so many people walking.  The streets had now taken on a very eerie feeling: the sky was perfectly blue and clear, except for the billowing smoke from the towers, thousands of people were walking, and the National Guard was out; normal street din was replaced with the sonic boom of bomber planes overhead and the scream of sirens from emergency vehicles heading every which way.  I reach Meri and felt great relief to embrace a family member.  After a couple of hours, it was time to go to Grand Central Station, where I had started my day, and make my way home to CT.   Fairfield stop next  never sounded so good.  I was home. Of course, the horror continues as we learn about effects of this disaster on family, friends, and strangers.  At the same time, we are seeing a surge of heroism, volunteerism and national pride.  I was in a store yesterday and felt an urge to buy a flag.  I have never been a flag-waver, but cannot control this feeling.  What is happening?  Extreme nationalism, like religious zeal, is dangerous, as these terrorist acts have shown.  But this urge to bond and unite with neighbors and countrymen is almost reflexive, like the urge to go to and gather together one s family and friends during crisis, the tendency to affiliate, even with strangers on the street.  The created sense of being part of a greater, larger social entity brings some comfort and meaning to life during crisis.  My heart goes out to those who have lost their loved ones and we must honor and respect the hundreds of men and women who have sacrificed their life in efforts to rescue others.  We are also seeing in America a pervasive spirit of giving and kindness toward others that has not been witnessed before, at least not in my lifetime.  Similarly, we are hearing more and more about acts of corporate and global goodwill.  Hopefully this will not all be a temporary change. It is a new America.  It is a new world.  Hopefully some day we will be able to say the result is a better world, but it is difficult to envision that today.  This started out as a brief email, thanking you for your concern, but obviously it has turned into something more.   Be well my friend.  I hope that we have a chance to meet sometime soon. With warmest regards, Steve \"Revenge and the desire to impose their world view upon others.\"My initial reaction when I saw the video of the second plane flying into the WTC was  Oh, my god   The shock of what happened soon changed to a feeling of helplessness.  Throughout the day I felt anger, sorrow, grief, sadness, and even moments of thankfulness when I would hear or see people being re-united with those who they thought they had lost. While attending a Unitarian-Universalist service on Tues. evening hearing the thoughts and feelings of others in our community gave me a feeling of hopefulness in that there must be a way for us (the US) to respond in a  different way  besides what is currently being described as the  military option   While my reply may be brief I hope this will be helpful to you and your colleagues at Univ. of Texas (as well as the rest of us in the world community).\"\"We all are.

It seemed to me that those around me at work weren\'t as affected by it as I was. They seemed able to carry on doing what they would have done. People talked about it at morning tea, as we would have any other world event, but with some extra degree of gravity, but theire seemed to be a degree of separation from it which I couldn\'t achieve. I kept thinking of my own oung children, and of the number of people around my age (32) who had lost the chance to see their kids again. This was my most profound pain.   The news footage guided my reaction beacuse it was in many ways a reflection of the shared shock aorund the world, especially in those first days. The reporters seemed as shocked and dismayed as me, both here in Australia and in the US.  As the stories of loss emerged, I felt intense grief. I cried on and off for two weeks, and when each new story of loss, or heroism emerged, I felt that same pain again. The US telethon was especially moving. I taped it and I\'ve watch it again. Still I\'m moved. Like anyone, I tried also to understand how and why this had happened. I stayed up late those first days watching news...hanging out for each tiny piece of new information, and often not learning any more, just to piece together a picture of what happened and why. I came pretty close to the true picture quite quickly, which was no consolation of course.  My need to know made me search the internet for anything related to Bin Laden, or the middle east, or the events themselves. I knew that I needed to separate the human cost from what I know to be at least some of the reasons for why this has happened, and these are the attitudes held by the west, and the economic and military actions taken by the US, such as your support for Israel, or your sanctions against Iraq.  I keep thinking about the children, but I reminded myself that children are children everywhere in the world. Some comments since seem to indicate that people don\'t see it that way. A western life seems to be worth more than that of a third world child. Of course it should not be, but there is a power imbalance which makes it so. I struggle to separate the thoughts of the complex and somewhat tragic nature of man, of what war is and if it is ever just, of the dangers of self interest, nationalism, imperialism, fundamentalism...call them what you will, from the feelings of how completely wrong it is that a child, any child, should lose their parents, or that brothers and sisters should lose their own, or that parents should lose their children. It seems that war has been waged with innocents, and only innocents, caught in the middle, and that there is a danger that it will continue to be.  I also wonder if anyone I knew was there.  I still haven\'t heard of the names of the twenty or thirty Australians  missing. I need to see a list of those lost, with their names. Otherwise it seems as though they haven\'t been truly acknowledged. It seemed arrogant that Bush said,  The time for mourning is over.  I doubt if the families think that..but leaders will do that I suppose. They do what they think they need to do.  Perhaps humanity needs to be sustained by the leaders themselves.

I had just returned home the previous night from a trip to the UK.  I probably caught the last flight to the west coast from Heathrow before the events happened.  I live in a small city halfway between the US border and Alaska, so it\'s off the beaten path.  When I turned on the TV in the morning was just after the second tower was hit.  My family was still asleep.  I watched in numbness for a while.  Then came the reports about Washington being struck.  Minutes later our cable went out.  It turned out it was due to a local accident, but my thought was, Holy shit.  This is continent-wide.   A few minutes later, I had to wake my kids and wife and I had to think in particular about how to prepare my kids.  Since the TV was out, we had to pull out a radio.  We were dumbstruck.  When the TV finally came back on, we just watched.  My son (18 years old) eventually said  That\'s the most fucked up thing I\'ve ever seen.   I teach at a small university.  When I got to work, everyone was just watching the many television sets located around the institution.  Some of the students were crying.  Nobody got anything done.  I\'m pretty sure I had the same set of reactions everyone else did in the days that followed.  The Saturday morning after, though, I awoke with my usual insomnia, and went downstairs to turn on the TV.  As I was watching the events, it suddenly occurred to me that I had been in contact a couple of weeks before with a good friend who used to work with me in Canada but returned to New Mexico a number of years ago.  What struck me was that in his last message, he had informed me that his son, who is a little older than mine, had made the goofy career choice of enlisting in the Navy.  We had exchanged a couple of humorous messages about the silly things he was hearing about boot camp.  Now, all of a sudden I realized that this kid, who used to play with my kids, could easily be on the front line soon, and I had to call my friend to just talk.  We had a great conversation and exchanged views on a bunch of things.  He asked me about my perspective as a non-American.  I said, I just hoped whatever the response it would be thoughtful.  I also remember being very angry the day after the attacks when the television broadcast George Bush from the Oval Office on the telephone, expressing concern to rescue workers and being congratulated on his leadership.  My thought was,  This is pure spin.   In the days and weeks since, I\'ve watched the events obsessively.  Although my political leanings are a little left-of-center, I have to agree that there is a need for some kind of assertive response, and I\'m pretty sure that that response will be as measured as it can be, so I\'m grateful about that.  On the other hand, one thing that really disturbs me is that I have seen little to no serious consideration by anyone with political influence to a question that was posed by one of the interviewers on Meet the Press or something.  The question was this:   Why do they hate us so much?  and I think it was addressed to Dick Cheney.  The question was never answered.  I think it\'s quite fundamental and all the military action and coalition building in the world won\'t help get to the root of it.  And until it\'s taken seriously, I think everyone\'s at risk.  What I worry about beyond that is my kids.  And I\'ve never been so grateful that I live off the beaten path.\"I\'m obsessed about following news events related to the attacks.  I think quite a bit about the impact on my kids and my American friends\' kids.I lost confidence in the human societyThis assault is the ultimate in horror and in human\'s perversity of thinking.

Our country should have been more aggressive and consistent in seeking out and suppressing terrorists. We should have also been more vigilant about the risks posed by countries and religious or other groups who, like the Nazis and the imperial Japanese, take young people and indoctrinate them to become fanatics, so that as adults they can be called upon to do self destructive things willingly in the furtherance of the cause they have been trained to support. However, the last country to attack us which supported fanatical training paid the price in August, 1945. This should have been a warning for the present terrorists, but our country has, in recent years, been ashamed of this act which saved thousands of American and Japanese lives by bringing the war to a prompt close.\"\"They were trained in these beliefs since childhood, as were the HJ in Germany and the Kamikaze\"',3,-5,0,2,5,1.01,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.53,1.52,0,0,3.54,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.23,0,2.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.86,4.04,0,3.54,0,1.01,0,0,0,1.01,0,2.02,0,0,0,6.57,11.63,3.03,1.01,0,0,3.03,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,5.06,Male49b
'\" For me it was a feeling of finally the other shoe had dropped. The terrible possibilities that I have felt were up in the air had become a concrete reality experienced by all. No longer did I feel the dissonance of having the world around me blythely going along the most trivial tangents avoiding any hint of realization of how dangerous our world had become and how precarious our expected mainstays actually were. History teaches that the first calendar year of a century sees the eruption of a new and terrible war which is the birth of that new century. Now that it has happened it can be dealt with. Quickly it has become clear the opposing forces of this new war are all forms of inflexible fundamentalism vs. freedom or flexibility of symbolic idealism. Falwell and those involved in anti-middle easters hate crimes have made clear that Christian and American  fundamentalism is as much of an enemy as the political and business interests represented by Ben Laden and Hamas.   In the \'60\'s we spoke of the confrontaiton of those who love life and those in charge of the machinery of death. Like the \'Age of Aquarius\' such notions referred to things that can only make sense to the general public now in this new century/millennium. Unlike the \'60\'s when we attempted to simply say these things or write them in slogans on protest placards or express them in our fashions and lifestyle; now it is clear this must be explained in simple concrete terms understandable to those of conservative and fundamentalist perspectives here and around the world.     In terms of the casualties, which includes parts at least psychic and mental of all of us, I grieve them in general as a human reaction to the awareness of human pain and loss. Beyond that, they are war casualties and in a war perspective, such tragedy is cause for quick grief and lasting resolve, eyes on the prize of future battle and victory and hopefully a realization of the human tragedy of war and that the campaigns be wage with a minimum of causualties on all sides.\"To promote their personal interests and advantageFundamentalists and political interests of the Arab nations who mistakenly think it is only a matter of one good defeat to get the US to run away and leave them to expand their empire.Being more polite from a greater compassion for those who can not understand what is going on or why things are now so different than they expect.\"The events of 9/11/2001 were the most cruel attacks that the U.S. has ever sustained and could be the most cruel attacks that this world has ever seen.  It was not just the lives taken in the 3 different areas, but the lives that will be lost due to the retaliation efforts by the U.S. and its allies. The terrorists\' attacks were essence a \'natural catastrophy\'.  The damage caused to lower Manhatten was worse than what a 7.8 earthquake did to Los Angeles in the \'90s.  No hurricane has ever taken so many lives nor has a tornado or flooding.  It makes me sick everytime I think about the passengers on the planes that crashed into the WTC and Pentagon--what could have they been thinking when they were flying over NYC. But through this horrible time in US history heroes have emerged and that will have a more lasting effect on the US than the attcks.

Since no recognized or otherwise legitimate government declared war in conjunction with that act, it cannot be considered an act of war.  One of the differences between organized crime and urban guerrilla warfare is the ideology of the participants.  Only ideology that supports the liberation or creation of a State can be rightfully called a doctrine of military intent.  Such military strategy is usually called guerrilla warfare.  All other forms of terrorism, including religious or criminal terrorism are not military in nature; thus, we cannot declare war on it (other than metaphorically).  A more accurate description of this type of activity is institutional corruption. One of the dangers of using the metaphor of war is that it can easily be used to mask the corruption it was supposed to eradicate. Some examples in American history are: The War on Crime:  Crime has us surrounded.  The Ministry of Peace says we are making progress every year.   Status: The STATE is fighting urban guerrilla warfare to free itself from the evil Crime empire.   The War on Drugs:  Drugs already won this war (see 18th(declaration) and 21st(unconditional surrender) amendments).  The Ministry of Truth says we can win.   Status: The STATE is fighting  saboteur style  guerrilla warfare to continue a war it already lost.   The War on Poverty:  Poverty is still firmly entrenched on all sides.  Depending on the accounting method being employed by the Ministry of Truth, the poor are making more and living better than ever before, and the rich are getting richer.   Status:  The STATE is fighting WWI style trench warfare, where progress is measured in yards. Our new war: The War on Terrorism:  Too new for description.  The Ministry of Truth says this war can be won.  The Ministry of Peace commented that they prefer to war with uniformed opponents. Status:  The STATE is considering upgrading its powers to POLICE STATE.  It should be noted; however, that in WWII, when the a STATE upgraded even beyond POLICE STATE to TOTALITARIAN POLICE STATE, it still had problems with internal security from terrorists using  saboteur style   guerrilla warfare tactics. \"\"If we apply the  War  metaphor, we have to posit that it was either a preemptive strike or a punitive strike for something the US was about to do or had already done.  \"don\'t knowNot in any meaningful way.0\" I am disturbed that there are humans that would kill thousands of innocent lives, screw up an economy, and scare thousands of people.

We were and are deeply saddened by the despicable events, and are concerned about how the evil cancer of terrorism can be excised from the body of Islam.  We also have thoughts about America\'s own indigenous terrorists, the racists, the isolationists, the sad individuals who create computer viruses, who call in bomb threats/scares for their sick amusement, who abuse and kill wives, children, gays, ethnic minorities, etc.  I pray that the tragedy and the unified and supportive response manifested by so much of the nation has lasting significance and will move the nation to a more complete and compassionate understanding of our role in the world and of our past failures to support struggling nations (Afghanistan after the Soviet retreat). \"\"It is unimaginable that someone would do this - but they have.

Through brute force if needed.To make us pull out of the middle eas.no changeI believe that this horrible tragedy could have been avoided.  America has been attacked before by terrorists and never went about to solve the problem.  At least now there can be relief that the world (or most of it) is joing together to try to stop or at least weaken the terrorist threats that are left in thus world today.vengeance for things done to themselves and others\"terrorosits, duh.\"Because they view the capitalist America as evil. Osama bin Laden\"they haven\'t. I live in Australia, I\'m not that scared yet.\"\"Well, where to start? I got home from work at 11pm on tuesday night and switched on the telly to find it all happening live over there in America. Watching it live was like nothing I have ever experienced. I can\'t imagine what it would have been like for the people on Manhattan Island who saw it with their own eyes, but even on the TV...every event unfolding as you watched. I laughed, not because I was amused, but because the scope of this event was amazing. It was a nervous, disbelieving laugh that just came out. I kept saying \'oh fuck\' as I watched. I knew it was going to be big.  The day after I started to feel scared. My mind probed into the future, mapping out worst case scenarios of World War III and the like. I guess you do that when you\'re afraid. It\'s a fuckn strange thought, the idea that a war in which Australia would potentially be involved may start. It\'s never been on the cards in my lifetime that\'s for sure. I also remember feeling useless (I\'ve heard a lot of people have been experiencing this). I really truly wanted to help somehow, impossible as that would seem. To see so many fellow humans suffering brings out something inside us all I think. I think we have inside us an instinct to help others in times of danger/crisis etc, and it was interesting because for me personally, I don\'t think it\'s ever really manifested itself quite like it did following these events. Anyway I\'m still a little scared about the prospect of war. I just hope America can hold back for a while until they have concrete proof of the offender\'s identity, that way maybe a war could be avoided. It looks bad though, with so many people crying for blood. I\'m a little ashamed with those people who are so narrow minded as to blame all people of the Muslim faith. That\'s existing racial hatred bubbling to the surface from my point of view, and it\'s amazing how many people have been harbouring it silently for all this time. It makes me sick.

'none0Hadred of the USA and our foreign policies in the Middle East/Islamic WorldTerrorists in sympathy with the ideology of bin LadenOsama bin Laden\'s network of terrorists\"The United States dropped the ball.  The old CIA should have taken Osama bin Laden out, years ago.  Sure, that would make the U.S. the terrorists and/or murderers, however, one  extremist  life compared to whatever the total of lives lost turns out to be.  You do the math.  Not to mention the livelyhoods of all the people who have or will lose their jobs over all of this  activity.   It just makes me sick.  Is it not the job of the federal government to protect the lives and interest of the people of the United States?   Taking out  that nut and all his followers was and is the job of the U.S. federal government.  \"\"Just angry that someone could do ALL of this to OUR country.  Kill ALL of those people, have ALL of those people lose their jobs and do ALL the things that has been done to OUR already struggling economy. \"Greed\"At base, we all are.  The immediate perpetrators, the guys that commited suicide are clearly responsible, but we can\'t punish them.  They were encouraged by others, who were ultimately responding in the best way that they know how, to correct, (or at least point out) wrongs (terrorism?) that we have commited.\"\"My first response was astonishment and disbelief.  I didn\'t belief the buildings could fall until they did.  As events unfolded, I suspected that the fourth plane was stopped by some heroic action, although I thought it was heroic action by the crew.  I was relieved and deeply moved when it became clear that that hijacking was foiled by the passengers. I have been expecting something like this for a long time, so the actual events were not that much of a surprise.   Earth Changes  have long been predicted by the indiginous people of North America, and, from their perspective, it was inevitable.  I had accepted that (unwillingly) a long time ago.  Although, I admit, I had expected it to be precipitated by a natural calamity (earthquake, tidal wave, or some such) rather than a man-made event. At no time have I felt any anger toward the perpetrators nor their supporters.  I feel that they think they had something important to say, and  we  weren\'t listening, so they did something to make us realize that they really meant it. My sense is that it has to do with  fairness , but I haven\'t heard anyone in the media use that term. I find the choice of targets interesting.  They attacked the symbols of world trade and military organization.  They did not attack the population at large or attempt to destroy the infrastructure (eg. poisoning the water supply or destroying electricity production.)  Their argument is with the forces of international trade (globalization) and the military (use of force to impose will). There have been protests against these institutions in the past.  (Protests in Seattle, peace marches around the Pentagon.)  And nothing came of it.  It is only natural for the protesters to increase the volume of their protests until they are heard. What scares me the most is the apparent  unified  response to this.  Statements made by the U. S. President that claim to be speaking for all Americans certainly do not speak for me.  Answering violence with violence can only lead to more violence. The only answer that will work is to recognize that the violence we just experienced is a direct result of our own violence (Grenada, Gulf War, etc.) and we must atone for the terrorism we have commited.  We must honor our own dark side, because these acts of terrorism against us are simply a reflection of our own attitudes toward the rest of the world. When we can honor our own evil side, we can sit down and talk to those who condone this sort of terrorism, and say,  OK.  What\'s your grievance?  How can we work together and share this world fairly.   We must recognize the value of different cultures and different value systems. In fact, it is irresponsible not to celebrate diversity.  Different cultures have different values, and it is exactly that difference that greases the wheels of cultural and economic exchange. All this talk about a  War on Terrorism  frightens me way more than the thought of another plane falling on innocent people.  This war is going to affect us all. The longer this war proceeds, the greater the Terrorists victory.  We can stop it by simply not starting it.  But I\'m afraid we won\'t.\"\"To make a statement.  To point out the inequities of the system.  To show how angry they are.  To say  If the world continues like this, life isn\'t worth living.  \"\"Somewhat.  I cancelled an airplane trip on Sept 18.  I\'m praying a lot more than I have in the past.  I\'m writing letters to my political representatives.  I\'m reading a lot about the events, mainly about the root causes and motivations of this event.\"\"None, really. Watch a lot of CNN.\"\"I\'m trying to focus on the underlying reasons of why this happened. Obviously, one feels tremendous sorrow for the victims, and anger directed at what appear (to Western culture) to be irrational acts by lunatics.  The real issue for me is how did we get to the point that people were determined to commit such acts? Is it the US involvement in the Palestinian question? (Some have interpreted even mentioning this possibility as being anti-semetic, which is not the case here). Is it the presence of Americans in Saudi Arabia? Or perhaps both of these issues are at play along with other issues. I simply don\'t know. I do know, however, that until we get at why this happened, we will not  solve  the problem. We will not  win  (however that is defined). In their socially constructed reality, the terrorists do not see themselves as irrational. I find the commentary by people who have actually lived in Afganistan or similar cultures most useful in trying to understand what do do. I hope our elected officals do the same. Even they admit the situation is much more complex than anything miltary action alone can accomplish. Only in that way can we avoid more grief and  the cycle of destruction. \"Direct responsibility is presumably with the radical groups that everyone suspects. I suspect Osama is the money source behind this. I still suspect some government might be involved at some level.See my inital answer. I have guesses and that\'s about it.\"This is the most important question.  I believe that there is fertile ground for extremism always in poverty.  And the people of the Middle East are desperately poor even when their corrupt and undemocratic governments are rich.  So charismatic leaders with destructive and inhumane messages, like bin Laden and his colleagues, have a ready army of poor, easily swayed youth to enlist in their overblown and egotistical cause.  Because extremist individuals will always exist, it is important for our government to  pursue just policies that do not fan the flames of extremism.  If bin Laden were an isolated evil genius, the towers would still be standing and your Web site would not exist.  It is the unjust and miserable conditions that the US has exacerbated that allowed his message to take root.  To name a few: our suport for a shameful monarchy in Saudi Arabia, our insistence on propping up Israel and embarrassing even moderate Palestinian leaders , and our ten-year cmpign of bombing and sanctions in Iraq which has taken so many innocent lives and turned the Arab world -- no lovers of Saddam Hussein -- against us. Looking rte other way when Pervez Musharraf seized power in Pakistan didn\'t exactly help our image in that coubtry, either.\"\"My wife and I and our neighbors watched the twin towers burn and crumble from the roof of our apartment building across town.  It was the most beautiful day, so incongruous, because I could turn my head slightly and everything was as perfect as the world could be, and then I would turn back and the implications of what was happening would flood my mind.  So many of the tangle of thoughts -- many of them seemingly contradictory -- that I was having as we watched the towers fall, I still have.  They have developed, fleshed out or whatever, but the basic thoughts are the same.  My personal process has been not to try too hard to process.  I have wanted to try and just sit with the feelings, the conflicting tendencies in my analysis, the range of emotions.  I believe that all that death will be in vain if I as an individual, we as a community, and we as a nation collectively cannot learn and grow from these deaths and what they have brought into our lives.  My experiences have taught me that I will not learn and grow if I do not absolutely GO THROUGH the experience, the raw, painful, weirdness of it all. So I find myself bouncing around.  Some of the different things that rush through me: Absolute sadness and grief at the magnitude of the lives lost, of the senselessness of each one of the deaths.   Anger at the US Government for pursuing policies that boil down to greed, for so long; throughout the middle East and the world at large, my government has for too long made alliances of convenience and self-interest rather than alliances of principle, ethical and lasting alliances, and we have burned through the natural good will of many people and peoples, and so we are left with what bad leaders have always been left with -- the need to use force and deception to hold back a rising tide of legitimate distrust and anger from the world\'s poor and oppressed.  A feeling of resignation that there is a kind of karma at work here, but also total anger that when the karma flies, it\'s innocent people who have to duck, innocent people who are blown out into the sky and whose bodies are vaporized, just like it\'s innocent women and children who have died in the hundreds of thousands in Iraq for 10 years, innocent Palestinian families who get caught in the crossfire on the West Bank, innocent Israeli schoolkids who get hardened and twisted to the life of the occupier, the never-safe, innocents everywhere flying out of exploding windows and getting burned in bomb blasts and strafed by artillery or starving and diseased from the effects of war.  I\'m so fucking sick of the slaughter of the innocents by the designs of the leaders of the world, who do their grim fucking business of detah, who go on their big fucking adventures and leave the rest of us at risk, leave postal workers dying of anthrax and everyone scared. Total violent rage at extremists who would claim that their religion not only justifies but demands the slaughter of innocents, the instillation of fear and pain in the hearts of their fellow human beings.  Despite all the humanist and leftist sentiment expressed above (and I am a humanist lefty by definition), I nonetheless will find myself wishing for the easy satsfaction of the total annihilation of the Taliban, the hunting down of bin Laden and his best and brightest generals, the torching of the schools where the narrowest and most violent interpretations of Islam take root -- in short, I find myself wanting war, wanting my country to kick ass. An extreme and almost painful tender-heartedness for everything in this sad world. Fear, total debilitating fear.   The desire to defiantly stay here in NYC, to cast my lot with my city for better or worse because if there\'s one thing I feel pride of place for, it\'s this remarkable, beautiful mosaic of people and the archaeological layers of human history here, yet the urge to leave, to run way, head for the hills of Northern Canada or Vermont or the Blue Ridge Mountains -- away from the targets.  The strong desire to take my wife and just go off somewhere we could have a garden and animals and kids and not live in the fucked-up world we know. I have spent a lot of time and energy trying to have good conversations with the Arab-Americans I meet, to try and counter the potential perceptions of mistrust between us, yet I sometimes find my mind wandering to the possibility that the nice Palestinians who run my local deli are really al Quaeda operatives just waiting for their cell to be activated and that one day I\'ll find my kindness repaid by a poisonous coffee!  So ridiculous, yet my mind wanders there, it\'s embarrassing even to admit to myself.  But these are the kinds of times we have to deal with. I\'ve also experienced something like joy at the way we New Yorkers have reacted, like a big family all grieving together, all trying to make it right, it just touches me so much when I think of how all of us were on the streets on Sept. 12, 13, 14, and beyond, doing whatever we could to pitch in, and how even now our civic encounters are markedly more polite, considerate, kind, careful, and filled with an implicit appreciation that we are all still here alive.  I cry just thinking about it. The memorials.  The candles and flowers that sprung up all over the streets and the parks and the doorsteps and the businesses and the firehouses and police precincts and everywhere.  It\'s like when someone you know dies, it\'s hard to maintain the kinds of daily illusions we have about the relative importance of things.  Like, ok, our jobs or the ball game or the next hollywood movie or that little spat with your friend or your partner -- like, who cares?  When you are faced with death, your priorities become clear -- and we are all so similar at our roots when these priorities are revealed.  That\'s what it\'s been like here.  And I don\'t want that to fade.  I don\'t want us to  get back to normal.   I don\'t care if the Yankees win the world series or if I make a lot of money.  I just want to feel like we are all appreciative of how fragile our existence is on this earth, and how much we and others can do to fuck it up, to take it for granted, or to just blow it altogether. My father turned 90 years old the weekend that the US started bombing Afghanistan.  He cried.  I thought, how heartbreaking, to live 90 years and feel like the only thing to change is the weapons.  He was an FDR man, he had high ideals and hopes for his country and his world.  He believed in the power of liberalism to change people\'s lives for the better.  He thought his government could be principled, thought his world could be peaceful and safe AND just.  We all believe in something when we\'re young, and thenw atch it betray us, I guess. I told the Palestinian guy at my local deli about my dad crying, and he looked sad too.  He said he hoped that when he and I were 90 years old, we  lived in a world with no guns, no weapons at all.   I think the biggest thing has been the smell.  We live close enough to  Ground Zero  that everytime they uncover a new smoking beam, or move the rubble around, we\'re liable to get hit with the smoke and stench.  And after a few weeks it really took its toll.  You realize that you are breathing in dangerous stuff, for one, no matter what officials say.  But more deeply, you feel stress and sadness and depression because on a biological level you are walking around doing this very important work of CLEANING THE AIR, taking the smoldering smoky electrical fire-tinged air into your lungs and breathing out something cleaner and new.  We are all of us doing this all the time, procesing the air to make everything ok again.  And it is very emotionally exhausting.  And deeper still, we are of course breathing in the ashes of the dead.  We ARE their vessels, their memorials, we are taking their ashes and their spirits into our bodies and carrying them around with us, literally metabolizing them, they are in some way becoming part of us.  It is abstract to think that way, but it\'s also physically true, and that is a profound thing that effects all of us whether we realize it or not.  I\'ve actually started going to church -- I\'ve been an atheist for the most part all my life, but church is the only place publicly where anyone is saying exactly what I feel like needs to be said.  It feels good to go there and cry and sing and hear people express the human dimensions of all this tragedy. I guess the last thing I am left with is this: when I have read about bombings and wars and collateral damage and civilian casualties over the years, I have of course been concerned on some level, but I have found it easy to go ahead and turn the page, turn off the TV, and go back to my life unchanged.  That\'s the key word, unchanged.  I mean, how much did Oklahoma City really effect me?  Or the latest round of conflict in the West Bank?  Or even the schoolkids in Northern Ireland getting shot on their way to class?  Honestly, not as much as they should have.  I think back and I don\'t think I even shed a single tear for Oklahoma City.  But having stood on my roof on that cloudless, blue, sunny day and watched the towers collapse, having heard my wife cry  Oh no, oh, no, oh no  in real time as the towers fell, having watched the clouds of smoke rise up from the streets and cover the whole city, having known people who were touched directly and indirectly by deaths too numerous to mention, having seen this in my own city and my own life for the first time, I guess I want to change, I want to admit that it has changed me forever, and I don\'t ever want it to be ok anywhere or anytime or any way it happens.  \"\"I don\'t take the subway if I can avoid it.  I am fearful of anthrax.  I am filled with conflicting emotions and analyses.  I try to be patient with myself and others in ways I might not have before.  I cry a lot more.  I say  I love you,  and  Be safe  a lot more to people, especially my wife.  I am drawn more and more to cats and dogs.  I am a musician, and I find myself playing and writing more ngry and loud music, less mellow stuff.  My self-promotional activities feel relly stupid and I have a hard time doing them.  I have a hard time concentrating at work.  I have weird dreams and a hard time sleeping.  While I don\'t feel patriotic about my country, I do feel incredibly proud of my city.  I\'ve started attending church regularly, which I have never done before in my life.\"\"I think there is plenty of blame to go around in a larger sense, but I ultimately believe that an act like this is unacceptable and the individuals who plan and perpetrate it must take final responsibility -- so I believe that radical fundamentalist Muslims planned and perpetrated the hijackings and are guilty of mass murder.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0.9,0,12.04,0.6,0,0,0,0,0.6,0.9,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,5.72,3.01,0,0.6,0.6,0.6,0,0,2.1,0,0,0,1.8,0.6,0,0.9,0,26.47,0,2.11,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,33.68,4.22,0,0.6,0,0,0,1.2,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,10.83,7.21,0,0.9,0,0,0.6,0,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,1.5,0.6,0,0.9,Male49b
'To coward and stupid to attempt to use rational means to straighten out differences\" As a 21 year old, I missed the harshest years of the cold war, and have lived in a  country that I feel has represented my ideals.  I feel the attack on the 11th was an attack on what I believe, which deeply hurts me.  I have always been taught to talk out differences and have never tried to force my views upon others without a reasonable  explanation of why I feel to be correct.  While many countries may feel the pressures of americanization there are other methods to try to stop it other than violence which is the most cowardly way of all.\"NoneOsama Bin-Laden0\"I feel it is terrible that suddenly we realise that passanger airplaines are the most lethal wepons exept for the atomic bombs. This will go down in history as one of the most revolting acts ever, it is like a second holocost. On the other hand I am surprised that the American nation does not ask why, where are all the Italians, the Poles, Scandinavians, Hispanics etc. The american affliction to Israel is never questioned, the US votes every time against all other in the security council for Israel, no matter what. Israel has its rights, but so have the Palistinians. And now the Israelis have voted the Prime minester, a war criminal, who let the Falangistas murder refugees in closed champs. He should be facing the tribune in the Hauge, along with Milocevits.  \"000\"These questions are unanswerable, they assume a position of supporting the US - my answers would relate not to the attack on the US but the response of the US\"0\"America received retribution for the terrorist act it has committed with impunity around the world. America should have become humble and apologised for its behaviour, and attempted to talk with the people who do not like America. Instead, it demonstrates that it is as mad as the people who committed the acts by murdering innocent people in Afghanistan and elsewhere. I do feel for the people who died in the WTC and in the Pentagon, most were innocent people who just want to get on with their lives. But I also feel for the hundreds of thousands of innocents who have died in Iraq because of US terror, or the thousands of Palestinians who are dying partly through US support of Israel (the quintessential terrorist state).\"Some secret service like the mossad or a combination of them.To keep the opium flowing (the taliban are eradicating it) and / or to eliminate muslims in favour of the jews.\"Everything we hear is disinformation: I do not believe the attacks to be from terrorist but either from  the mossad to generate war agains the muslim world, or from a combination of special services to keep the opium drug trade and at the same time do something in favour of israel and the jews. In any case, everything we are told is fabricated and untrue for  the most part, and the world is going to suffer from all this and because of the stupidity and greed of a few. In any case, IF the attack has been made by real muslim terrorists as jihad, it is understandable that they are angra against the US,  which has been supporting the genocide of Palestinians and other  populations in the world, and which has been playing the cops of the whole world for enough time yet. But, again, i do not think it has to  do with Jihad.\"\"I belive even less in the news, especially CNN and all the jewis manipulated media\"\"Osama Bin Laden, maybe Saddam Hussein\"\"I believe this is the worst tragedy in our history-- Pearl Harbor only lost 2500 people--- not to take that lightly, but they were military---- not innocent men, women and children! This is the first time America has been attacked since the War of 1812-- when the British overran the White House, and James and Dolly Madison fled! That was 189 years ago! We waited too long--- 2 American facilities bombed 2 years ago, the USS Cole bombed last year-- we should have acted then! Should have acted as Reagan did against Libya and Moamar Kadafe-- that ended terrorism for many years! We have let these people run over us so long, that they no longer fear us!!!!!!!  I also think that the news media should stay out of the war. Wait until one of our covert operations blows up a bunker, thought to contain terrorists, and turns out to be civilians!!!! Then the news media will tell the whole world what happened. We know that in all wars, including WWII, there were civilians and our own soldiers killed by friendly fire. But we didn\'t need anybody there to report this!! There are casualties in any war! We don\'t need the news joining in our secret operations. I think they tell too much now, to the world, for our own good as Americans! Time to kick ass and take names!!! If they get away with this- we are through as a country. We will be completely overrun, by our enemies. Also, I would like to know how these idiot, pacifist college kids, think we should let this pass??? What is their solution? How do you deal with people who think that by killing themselves and thousands of others, they are doing a wonderful deed, and will be rewarded in the after life for such deeds? DUH??? I feel sure that WE will have no problem, with these people, at the negotiating table, coming to some good sound resolutions, based on good judgement and logic! Yeah? Right? After all, look at their own countries-- constantly torn apart and devastated by war among themselves. Their people are starving, homeless, no hope, no where to go! Living like animals in the desert! Millions of widows and orphans. This is their OWN people- not their enemies! Their own people are starving, yet they have enough time and money for WAR??? What\'s wrong with this picture? These people are warmongers- born and bred to fight- after all, they\'ve only been fighting for thousands of years. At best, with the desert-like condition of the areas they live in, it would hard to scratch up a living! They don\'t throw their money away foolishly, on things such as food, clothing, and shelter. Hell no, they buy important stuff, like missles, mortar rockets and ammo!!! Same with their time--- they don\'t waste their time with things like growing crops, building homes and planning a future for their children! Their time is too valuable- what, with all the killing, bombing and wreaking havoc on their neigbors going on- and living in the ground like rats, they just don\'t have time for foolish things in life! A very forward people too, I might add! Women not allowed education. They are kicked around like dogs! Men jailed for not having long enough beards. Limbs severed for simple crimes! Very progressive group- Why, they\'re moving right along! I figure in a couple hundred years, if they don\'t kill each other off, they\'ll be moving right up into the 1st century AD. Now that\'s what I call progress!! Their philosophy-  If you can\'t eat it, or screw it- blow it up  Sounds politically correct to me- How \'bout you?

Though they have been funded in their exercise, they still know the pains of privation from early childhood - and are convinced from day 1 that the USA is responsible for not only their lot in life, but the pains of their friends and loved ones This blind rage developed in childhood, coupled with \'convenient\' misinterpreataion of the Koran, have served to promote their \'mission\'.

There are no demands, reasonable or otherwise, by the perpetrators; there is not even a claim of responsibility so far. The atrocities are not politically-motiviated, only hatred-motivated. In response, the USA and its supporters must keep a cool head to seek out only those who are directly/indirectly responsibile, and must maintain the \'moral highground\' in the way they respond, lest they be criticized by other nations who already feel the perpetrators had a legitimate beef with US foreign policy. An unmeasured response would play right into their hands, and feed the anti-American frenzy. It annoys me how overplayed the \'hatred of America\' angle has been played - esp. as living in the UK has exposed me to many points of view that Americans aren\'t hearing as much. I am not as \'angry\' as I am \'depressed\' and sickened that so many innocent people have lost their lives. Whether their deaths are avenged with a successful response is immaterial. They are dead - and in a way, the perpetrators have had a victory already. The entire episode has made me very homesick - and made me love and respect my fellow Americans all the more. \"Islamic fundamentalists with the backing of anti-Western groups including possibly fascist and other totalitarian organizations throughout the world. See response on first page.\"America and the  Western World,  the free market system that they propagate and the corporate entities that they  harbor  continue to do battle with the other economic systems and societies of the world.  Because of advances in applied technologies over the past 30 years, the West\'s  terrorists  (the Global 2000) have sufficiently penetrated the economies and civilizations of Islam (and other non-Western societies) with Coca-Cola, Marlboro cigarettes and Mickey Mouse.  On September 11th, we experienced the initial attack, in surely what will be a series of retributions against the Western marketing system for its assault on fundamental Islam (and other non-Western societies.)  The same technology that has enabled the rapid dissemination of this way of life on these societies is being used by these societies (through fringe, militant terrorist organizations) to turn the free market on itself.      The role of government in a free market is to preserve the marketplace, which is precisely what the governments of the US, NATO countries and its allies must do.   But, we have reached a crossroads in western civilization.  Rather than succumbing to these terrorist threats, the US and its allies must take the moral high ground.  We cannot fall victim to these attacks by losing our personal freedoms in the process; creating an overtly controlled society is tantamount to tyranny.  Nor, can we respond in a knee-jerk show of military mite.  If we did either, the terrorists could declare victory now.   To sit by idly would be equally reprehensible.  The only sensible course of action will be either to isolate the Western world from other societies (difficult with our dependence on their raw materials and emerging markets) or begin a vigilant attack on the basic ideologies espoused by these fringe groups.  I believe this course of action enables the preservation of our marketplace, while systematically, if slowly, disassembling this anti-free world movement.    This war will have many battlefields, from Internet chat rooms and spin doctors\' laptops, to the Swiss bank accounts of the wealthy backers of this terrorism, not to mention the treacherous landscapes of Afghanistan and neighboring anarchies.  These battles will be fought at a high cost to both sides.   The loss of humanity, opportunity and capital will be great, but not as great as these costs will be if we fail to act, or act imprudently. Unlike most wars, this one has no beginning or end.  It has been fought for thousands of years.  Humans are competitive - greed is an innate human condition:  Greed for power, for money, for love and for life.  In the end, I believe that our Western civilization is the worst socio-economic system on earth, except for all others.  Until someone betters our system, it will win over would-be fascist, communist or this latest totalitarian form of rule championed by these Islamic fundamentalists, but secretly supported by many others as well.   I am proud to be an American - God bless the USA.                  \"\"I believe changing one\'s personal behavior because of these attacks is admitting defeat by the terrorists.  I have already traveled by commercial aircraft since September 11th.  However, I am running my business in a very cautious manner, given the future economic uncertainties. \"I feel a great deal of hate for the actions that took place on September 11th 2001.  I believe that is was also bound to happen when you are on top like the United States is people are always trying to better you and take you down that is obviously what these terrorists intended to do but they did not succeed it takes alot more to ruin a country as strong as the U.S.  I feel that we should go to war and make everybody who was involved in this suffer greatly we can\'t hold back we do it to often.  I personally would go to war in a second and would have no second thoughts.  God bless all of those we have lose in this great deal of tragedy and god bless all the people how have suffered from this and lost loved ones.Ossaman Bin Ladennot really at allto bring down the U.S.\"Bin Laden probably didn\'t get enough attention as a kid. He was one of 50-some children and his father died when he was 10. For some it is probably a release of sexual frustration, living in such a repressive society.  Also, some plain old ENVY of America and the need to have a scapegoat to blame for one\'s own dismal existence.  That\'s my profound psychological analysis. \"Probably Bin Laden and other similar organizations working together.I lock my car door while driving around Riyadh. I choose my airlines more carefully now.  I am paying more attention to how Saudis are reacting to me as an American in their presence.\"It is very scary in its efficiency. From a personal point of view, it is certainly a travesty of human life.  Not to sound sick, but I teach art and from an artistic, visual point of view, the demolition of the two towers was almost  beautiful  and poetic in its graceful demise. That of course is greatly overshadowed by the horrendous thought that innocent women and children were used as missiles against ourselves.   I think much of the world has tried to have it both ways for too long -- reaping the benefits of the US while heaping abuse upon it.  The US can rightly be blamed for turning a blind eye to Israel\'s excesses (the no.1 cause of all this hatred against us), but much of the Muslim world has a double standard about the definition of terrorism.  Palestine seems to be the darling of the world these days (by Muslims and non-Muslims alike) but their terrorist activities are equal to that of Israel. As for America, the  new world disorder  makes the 90\'s look like the 50\'s used to look.  The 50\'s nowadays seem almost utopian in retrospect.  The only good that has come of this event is that it has allowed us to glimpse the future, and like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, we have a chance to change it. \"',4,-5,0,2,5,1.37,2.74,0,0,0,0,0,4.11,1.37,0,1.37,0,11.64,1.37,0,0,0,0,1.37,1.37,0,1.37,0,0,0,0,4.11,0,0,2.05,0,1.37,0,0.68,4.11,0,0,0,1.36,0,0,1.37,0,33.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.14,6.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.07,9.58,0,1.37,0,0,8.22,0,0,1.37,0,0,0,0,1.37,1.37,0,1.37,Male49b

Because there is not a person in the picture,I mistook for being the  part of some movie.I knew after the event the building was the center of the trade.So,in the moment that an event was caused, I thought  that the airplane merely bumped against the tall building.Of course,  I thought this event was not an ordinary thing.I am the human being who has a conscience. But I wasn\'t surprised as much as the person who  saw that event directly. The mass communication doesn\'t tell new information and only repeats  the same picture.I had a doubt to the way of mass communication\'s  telling an event.In japan,the way of reporting the damage of the  earthquake in Kobe became a problem.I ruffled by the way of the report as if to see just like uncommon the curious spectators.The excited  announcer doesn\'t seem to be telling a situation accurately. Gradually I ruffled. Because I saw that event from a distance, it was difficult for me  to take the event as the actual one.I didn\'t feel sad as deeply as  American.We don\'t feel sad every time we see terrible news. As an event was reported in detail, I became fearful. After I knew that the terrorist caused the event, I thought the similar event may happen in Japan. Nothing will break out immediately, I think optimistically now. \"I have no clue I a little more alert about where I\'m at like football games and airport;places that can attract a lot of people.revenage\"    I was shock about how things took place and how the airplane flew directly into the towers. It surprised me when I saw the second airplane hit the tower. I was a little nervous, because I m apart of the National Guard. I thought that we were going to get call up for war.

I think the way the Bush administration has acted is very senseful, very calm in the view of the cruel attacks and sometimes there is no other way than to attack.

Although I think those responsible have a right to be angry, what they did is pure evil.\"A network of terrorists justifiably angered by U.S. foreign policies0\"I was horrified by the attacks.  I felt profound shock and fear.  My fear was enhanced by my growing conviction that in a society such as ours, there really is no way to prevent attacks of this nature.  The risk for such tragedies comes along with a free and open society. I feel that our government\'s response so far has been simplistic, to put it mildly.  In no way will a military campaign against Afghanistan address the root causes of these actions.  On the contrary, such a campaign will fan the flames of hatred toward the U.S. and make terror in this county more likely in the future. And the planned action is one that cannot possibly achieve its objects.  Veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan are screaming at us,  don\'t do it! you cannot win!   And yet still we forge ahead.\"\"My name is Bjoern and I`m studying Socialmanagement. I find this international study very interesting and important. The terrorist attacks of Sep.11.2001 are an event that will have a great effect on the whole world. A lot of people in Germany have friends and relatives in the US and visited the States for a several times. I myself have relatives in your country. My father lives in Texas, my sister in Virginia. My sister wanted to come over to Germany again after two years last week but she stayed at home because she had to fly from Washington D.C. and would have had bad feelings sitting in an airplane only five days after the attacks. I deeply hope that the United States and the other NATO members (Germany as well) will not start a war which will leed to more terror attacks all over the Western World. You cannot answer terror with terror! The best example is the conflict between Isreal and the Palestinians. These fundamentalists have such a great ideology that you cannot defeat with violence. You can compare their goals with the goals of Hitler-Germany. But the big differences are, a) that there is not only one country, and b) there are no military aims, to fight against. In Germany the government is changing a number of laws to have greater oppertunities to get controll over some extreme islamistic groups in our country. Our constitution is based on, just like in the US, personal and religious freedom, which is good. A great fear although is that some islamistic groups unify each other under the protection of our constitution to support Osama Bin Laden and other terrorists with financial help. There is a big discution in our parliament how far these law changes can go without dicriminating moslem groups. I do not have an answer for all these questions or appropriate alternatives to the upcoming strikes against Afghanistan and other possible  enimies . But I do hope that we all are not standing infront of a new great war. We had enough wars in the last 100 years!

'\"To prove a point.  Someone obviously trying to make celar that the US has been arrogant, and that we are not indestructable.\"\"To see hundreds of flags flying from homes and cars everywhere I go, sends tingles down my spine, and tears to my eyes (almost). Where I am from, we were taught a lot about pride. In sports especially we were taught to lay it all out in the name of our school, town, and for the good of our teammates. Voting rates are low, ghettos have been formed to distinguish different types of people, and there are less and less rally\'s evident, fighting for what is right. It seems to me that this country as a whole has lost the pride that has made it so strong. People are constantly complaining about things that are wrong, whether it be nation wide or as small scale as on this campus. Never, however, have I seen anything done about it. The closest thing I have seen that resembled any kind of activist movement was a certain Rev. starving himself to stop an unjust military operation. Why have we stopped wanting to improve this country?  The founders of our country developed certain documents, outlining the way that life should be lead in the country they bid their lives to win. IN their genius, though, they did not neglect to realize that things must change with the passage of time and formation of changing societies. In this way, the left the actual designing of morals, and standards by which we live up to each passing generation. What happens when we stop caring about the country and the changes that need to be made? We are rudely awaken by foreign evils.  Perhaps this was the right thing to happen to this country at a time in our world that we are so bored and unmotivate, that trials of celebrities end marriages, and ships and islands full of horny men and women become top priorities. Perhaps we have been brought to realize that we have been neglecting the glory of this country, and that it is time to be proud again. Thousands of men and women have died to produce and protect the freedom that we are handed to us at birth. It is our responsiblity to keep this jewel we are given well protected and polished. That should be our norm.  To answer the question  Should we go back to be Normal?  I think if we look back to the way things once were in this country; so full of pride, we would realize that in fact we are already there. This country has a tradition of Pride, and of love between the fellow men as outlined in the words of our forefathers.  Go back to being normal!?  We are already there.  \"I don\'t know and will not assumeNot at all.\"It was obviously incredibly shocking when it happened last Tuesday, but to me, the emotion and reality of it was almost overpowered by the world\'s, and the authorities\', rushed reaction to it. No sooner than those men flew into the WTC, their names were up on the screen for the world to see, their names made known even before many of the innocent victims of their actions. Since they gave their own lives for this evil act, I felt that revealing their names was giving them the only thing that they had to gain from doing this thing: notoreity. The media were quick to assemble their repeat logos and footage of the crash which they showed around the clock - not as a reminder, more as a jingle. The president spread fear - harmless fear among the rest of the world, but dangerous fear to those countries neighbouring Afghanistan. He foolishly threatened to kill more innocents, and, astonishingly, people (the polls say) were eventually swung to agree with him (probably by the media). Though I am as saddened as anybody, and shocked more than any time in my life, by what happened on 9/11, the emotion I feel most about not just the day itself but its continuing aftermath, is despair in mankind. Many times in the last 7 days, I\'ve felt incredibly ashamed to be human.\"The World - anyone pointing the finger anywhere else is being as single-minded as whoever they think they\'re pointing at.Even more despaired.It unfortunately happens.\"My intial reaction to the events of 9/11 was one of denial and disbelief.  This quickly gave way to anger and a feeling of personal violation.  As I have inspected myself and watched the rhetoric of the politics involved I now find myself wondering what the eventual outcome of this will be, and feeling that our  new war  may well lead us into an atmosphere of fear and anxiety about the future, which was exactly the desired psychological affect of the terrorists in the first place. There also remains a residual feeling of violation and anger although I am able to deal with this much more effectively as time passes.\"The only behavior that I am aware of is that I think that I am processing more of my feelings about people in general and this has translated into more outward display of emotion such as anger and discussion of feeling about the event.\"See above.  Basically because they have somehow convinced themselves that theirs is the morally superior path and that they have rationalized their actions, through this belief.\"\"Although the intial evidence points to Bin Laden, et.al. I think the real responsibility is with all of us.  Due to media coverage and desensitization to war, we, as a nation, and to some degree, the world,  have become apathetic to what really goes on around us in terms of international events and focus.  Perhaps it all boils down to a lack of personal responsibility and our concepts of whether Evil really exists as an entity in the world. \"\"The attack changed life in the US forever and has shattered the illusion that we have held for many years that we were immune to terrorist atrocities in our country. I don\'t believe that this is an isolated incident and we will see more in the weeks/months/years to come. The terrorists proved that sophisticated weapons are not necessary to cause mass destruction in our open and vulnerable society. There have already been outcries that our civil liberties are at risk, but I, for one, am willing to put up with substantial security measures if they will help to combat terrorism here. While it will be impossible to protect against all future terrorist attacks, it is important for our government to do whatever can be done to provide a measure of safety for its citizens.

And terrorist used our own planes.  But I really felt sorry for all the People that lost their live from this.  As the day went on, I learned more on how things went and the video tape that the news showed. It still shocked me and surprise on how long the building where standing. As George W. Bush gave his speach I felt better, that we(as a country) would take this lightly. If Gore was pers. I don\'t want to know what he would do. At the end of the day, I still could believe the news, but there it was.... But I thank God that most of the people made it out alive. I first thought that 20,000 at least would have deid in those buildings.  Then to find out that less than 6,000 died. Made me feel better. When they had people on the new telling people that they lost a Husband/wife. That is not what made almost cry; it was what they did.  They called their loved one to say good bye, that did. That day I had all mixed emotions: Mad, Hate, sad, shocked. I dont feel that we need more security in the airports, just better people watching out for someone that look like they going to do something that will kill a lot of people. And better doors so it is hard to break down the door. But this didn\'t do what the terrorist wanted, but it did one thing. To give us one common goal, to punish those that did this.

I seek punishment for those that planned and carried this out but I have no sense that it ultimately will be able to prevent another attack. I have the feeling that we are now part of the rest of the world, no different than someone in Lebanon that survived the civil war. My other profounf feeling is that I feel the latent racism that is arising in the society.

I fear that innocent people around the world will become victims of the US war machine, like so many others in the past.  Violence begets violence, and we have the choice to either continue to perpetuate this horrible cycle, or we can break it and address whatever issues might have led someone to do this, rather than simply retaliating.\"\"I don\'t think that anyone really knows for sure.

'EvilNot at all\"The acts of terrorism themselves beggar the imagination. That human beings were prepared to commit them, planned them, made decisions about them, then expended their lives on them is more than a European/North American sensibility can take in. We are faced not with the radical actions of an oppressed minority, but with the overt expression of deliberate evil. The acts cry out for vengeance -- which is the worst thing we could do. A comprehensive, global perspective on justice and mercy, personal, corporate, and national responsibility, and moral and material generosity will do more to shame the terorists and bring them to justice than carpet bombing a tenth-century nation back into the second century will ever do.\"Osama bin Laden\" PEACE!!!  La salud mental representa una de las  ltimas fronteras que es preciso franquear para mejorar la condici n humana. Habida cuenta del estigma y abandono generalizados, la salud mental debe ser incorporada ahora mismo en la agenda internacional  (OPAS,1997). Armando Ribeiro das Neves Neto. Sao Paulo - Brazil\"Poverty all the world over.injustice feelingsEconomics redistribuition.\"Honestly, both the American government and the Terrorists. Bin Laden is just a player among thousands, if not millions.\"\"Much discussion has been made about this event, and rightfully so. A lot of it revolve around the desire to retaliate. To be completely  honest, my reaction was very much along the same lines. But after much reflection, I am at a confused state. It is true that thousands of lives were lost. (A friend of mine who  worked (used to) at the 97th floor of tower 2 barely escaped). The  shock that comes along with that is nothing short of amazing; add to  that the fact that our sense of the invulnerability  of America has  been destroyed. It is easy to get angry. But let\'s get things into perspective and ask why this happened? The reasons are both fair and unfair. It\'s fair because America has been indirectly instrumental in the persecution of a lot of people, especially Arabs. If you ask me, America should keep out of other countries\'  business. It is unfair because these Islamic fundamentalists are calling a Jihad on people who believe in God just as much as they. The way  they choose to deal with the issue is also very unfair. Each side has its  hurts.  But who\'s right? The terrorists are wrong  in as much as they employ the tactics that they do; America is wrong in as much as it employs indirect tactics to deal with the Arab-Israeli issue. However, the Arabs are right in seeking vengeance for the  suffering they have been put through; and America is right for wanting revenge for the suffering it just went through. So, do we nuke \'em? Do we kill Bin Laden? I don\'t think that\'s the  answer. Killing more innocent people only ups the ante. Killing  Bin Laden will not stop the terrorist. It might even inspire them. I think America needs to be less arrogant; have less of the big bully attitude; work hard to find the reason for why this tragedy happened, and work towards creating a fix at the source.  In the meantime, what do we do? I don\'t know.\"Hatred caused by ignorance and persecutionI don\'t think it has\"I feel that I am one of only a few people that can see beyond the tragedy 9/11 to the long-term problems that have festered and given rise to these actions.  People don\'t want to hear that their need for cheap gas in unlimited supplies has propped up Middle East despots who suppress civil rights and give rise to revolutionaries.  If you really want to fight a war on terrorism, trade in your SUV for a sub-compact, or turn off the lights in a room when you leave it.  I truly feel sorry for the people that died in the WTC and the Pentagon, but we have ignored the repression that has been done on our behalf for so long that it takes an act of this magnitude to get our attention.  Unfortunately, our leaders have chosen to deal with the symptoms of the problem, terrorism, rather than the root cause.  We are a greedy, self-righteous nation that is so involved with our own collective ego, we won\'t look to the needs of others.\"Not at all.Osama bin LadinAnger and frustration with the lack of civil rights in middle eastern nations.\"First of all IT WAS INEVITABLE. If it hadn\'t been this maniac it would have been another..    somewhere, somehow, someday.  It is a feeling that cannot be described. Even though I didn\'t have anyone immediately involved in this, it felt like I did and it hurts. I believe I honestly know a bit (very small) 0f how the recipients of our anger must feel. Is it right that we destroy their lives. America has always stood for what is right and been fair in identifying the culprit, cathing them, and making them pay for their crime. Unfortunately it may not be possible with this incident but do all of the people within their borders need to pay the price for the actions of a few?  Even though this carpet bombing goes on, the U.S. still has not hit their intended target.  I hear stories about the CIA, Seals, FBI, and others being able to infiltrate almost any environment, find their target and bring them to justice.  Why not this time?

'\"I believe that the events are extremely historic in that they have officially brought our country\'s day to day life into the arena of personally experienced world terrorism.  In addition, they demonstrate that just as Great Britain was vulnerable to guerilla tactics in 1776, we, today\'s super-power, are vulnerable to the same types of attack. Psychologically, the attacks will probably reduce our belief that we are physically insulated from such acts and are relatively invulnerable to the threats that people of other countries face.  In a way, that is a good thing because it should cause us to commit ourselves more intensely to building world alliances to fight and defeat such terrorists.  In addition, it appears to be pulling our people together more intimately to stand up as a united nation to defend and profess our way of life and our values. As a believer in reincarnation and the unified fabric of life, eternal life as it were, I feel great sorrow for the families of the victims, but do not feel that humanity is truly threatened.  This is because I believe that all experiences, both joyful and terrible, are simply part of the continually unfolding journey of both individuals and humankind.  The important thing is for all people to recognize our common humanity and to keep trying to be what we are intended to be in the grand scheme of things.   Having said that, I also feel that it is important for our country to take strong and decisive action to find and hold accountable the people and organizations that are responsible for both executing and supporting these attacks on society.  In doing so, we need to reaffirm our position of world leadership and support of human values. Finally, on a more visceral note, we should kick ass as long as we find the right ass to kick! \"Intense psychological pathology and hatred based on cultural influencesOsama bin-LadenVery little; more overtly expressed patriotismBuilt up anger due to poor living conditions and oppression from the American Government.\"As stated before in my previouse answer, the US has picked too many fights with developing countries not taking in consideration the effects it will have on their people.  We have supported the rise of industry on an international bases in efforts to better serve the needs and wants of our people while killing and disturbing the lives of millions elsewhere.  We have sanctioned governments that were poor to begin with.  We made promises during the cold war that we would help rebuild afganistan if they would help us defeat Russia and never did.  They attacked Saudia Arabia the home of Osuma Bin Laden who was once our allie and then say the attaks as a smack to the face.  The US has lied, and manipulated the minds of its people.  \"\"When I see a plan I do not think of family vactions or its designation.  I see a weapon in the sky that could be aimed at my work place.  My attitudes have changed from offensive to defensive.  I try to fight for the rights of those here in the US that are being judged based on ther race, culture or ethnic background.\"\"The events that occured on the 11 have plagued my mind since it happened.  My feelings have been rather mixed and diferent.  I have been contemplatig the numerous deaths that have been taken.  This was not an attack on freedom, but an attack on huamnity.  Because of our evil government many families are sobing holding on to only memories of dear ones.  Our governemnt has not been upfront with its people.  It is an imperialistic monster that supports industry over its people.  Look at Nigeria and Shell, also look at ITT and the Copper fields in Chile under the fall of Allende.  The US has been single handedly picking fights  with developing countries and something as disasterous as 9-11-01 was bound to come.  I feel that we need to reevalute what our government is doing as well as speak our voices.  After all our so called elected officials are not.  Also I feel that our nation must becareful not to revert to nationalism.  We as a people must not judge individuals according to race, color, or ethnic background.  Nor should we consider the US as the best, because although our people maybe the best our government is far from that.  The last thing I will leave with James and Sherlock is that I felt heartbroken to see people die.  I was desturbed and unable to concentrate at work and in class.  As a student of minority backgrond I was in fear of others being hurt.  Not me in particular, but some of my friends.

I could hardly believe I was seeing the act on the TV.  After thinking about it, I know it represents the feelings of certain people in the international community based upon their perception of this country and its attempt to control other countries through brute force.  I know it is not correct, however, we should take a more even approach in international affairs, particularly in the mid-east.  There is no reason to favor one country over another.  I grieve for the people who were victims of the attack and hope the country helps their families financially.  This was an act against our country and not the victims.  We should do what we can to stablize the international opinion of our country.  We have reacted exactly like the terrorists expected by going balistic and letting these acts disrupt the entire nation.  We should stabilize the economic situation and then plan on how to avoid further acts.  In the case of terrorists, we should very carefully find the ones involved and do what we can to bring them to justice. We now have the international community in our corner and we should not take irresponsible attacks on countries and kill innocent people.  Like a surgeon, we should find the people involved, arrest them, then subject them to our judicial system.  If we do not, we will start a religious war that will not ever end.  Retribution will be the way of the future.  That is the reason we must be extremely careful in our action.\"Nothing except worry like hell over the investments I have in the stock market and be really concerned about the way the country has gone balistic over the events.\"I do not have a clue.

Well I understand, that what had happened in US (terrorists bombing civilian targets) were happening in  India since 20 years! Americans always felt insulated  from terrorists attack till WTC collapse. Well,  look at  Sri Lanka. That small nation was affected with LTTE terror since  20 years.  What was US  doing  during those times?  Did they care even to speak about it ?   Infact, the terrorists  organizations that operate in India and Sri Lanka were being funded by their sympathizers in US, Canada and Europe. Not a single US administration was serious about  taking these matters  to a stop.   Finally,  the otherday terrorism reached  the heartland of US . And now  US is thinking deeply about it. Suddenly, US wants to define terrorism, US wants to clear all the UN dues, US wants  every tiny nation on earth to vote for them on terrorism issue,  US  wants to become an international police on the matters of  terrorism,  US wants Israel to shut their Guns  in the middle east :  What  a  nation ?  What a  change ?  We laugh at it ! After all ,  US should look back and see how they have behaved in the past  when various far away countries lived in fear and pain of  terrorism .  US colluded with various terrorist to get things their way. Various peoples  moments  in Asia were toppled  using  CIA  and  money.  Can\'t we not call it a state sponsored terrorism ? True, Islam is no religion for US. The cultural values of Islam is totally  obsolete. But as US has allowed thousands of  Muslims to immigrate to their country there is very little US can do but to live with them. Through out the world, Islam has become the a real problem to deal with. More over, many many Christian Blacks have been converted to Islam as the Christians have not been able to fully integrate the Blacks into their way of living. So Americans have to live with this thing called Islam. There is another fact too for that religion: Where ever Islam exist, they populate very fast and will never fully integrate with the laws of US. They will continue to teach Arabic and will love Islam more than America.      Today, US  believe that  world economy should integrate. US is forcing economic liberalization on poor nations of the world. For  the US government,  IMF and World Bank is doing that trick.  But then, like economy, peace and terrorism too is an  integrated  commodity.  No nation can remain an isolated peaceful heaven. Remember, US cannot  build a nation free of  war and terrorism when the whole world  is deep in such problems. Like economy, peace  too is integrated.

In many movies, TV shows, novels, etc. the hero is often a loner who is misunderstood by authority (Dirty Harry, Die Hard) or at the very least, outmanned and forced to improvise and use his wits (James Bond, MacGuyver).  We root for that person, knowing the odds are against him but he will somehow triumph.  In sports, too, some of our most cherished national stories and mythology are about David beating Goliath (US defeat of Russian hockey team, Miracle Mets). We are now faced with being unable to play that role.  Who as children wanted to be the Japs or the Nazis?   We all wanted to be the brave guys trapped in The Bulge or the few holding out in the Philippines.  It is only fun being the Big Guy if you get to be the cavalry coming to the rescue.  Was it really enjoyable to watch the US crush the rest of the world in Olympic basketball? Our new role as Goliath, faced with a David  we would applaud under other circumstances for his grit, determination, preparation, resourcefulness and bravery, leaves us with cold comfort.\"noneterroristshatredMy immediate response was shock and disbelief.

Those whose ancestry matches a bigots profile of evil will be unwelcome, and facist tendancies will rise to the surface too often. i also believe no  war  will make a difference. Other fanatics will replace bin Laden. I feel sad and quiet lately, but not depressed. I have been to NY twice and it is remarkably quiet. LaGuardia airport is empty...\"\"quieter, more introspective\"it is beyond my understandinglikely bin Laden\"  Well to beggin with... i was very saddened by this horrible incident. When if first happened i couldnt believe it. i was in class and my teacher had not arrived, but one of my friends came in and started telling me and our other friends that a plane had just crashed into the twin towers. No one wanted to believe him. About half an hour passed and out teacher never came so we went out of the classroom and found out she had not gotten there because of the incident. Then we all went to the caffeteria and started listening to the news on the radio and then actually believed what had happened. We Heard from others that classes were canceled for the day, so we left the campus only to find out that no trains or busses were running and that the bridges were being closed off. By now i was feeling some kind of fear. I was living in 162nd Sreet in Manhattan and i had to go home walking. I moved to yonkers about a week ago. Me and 2 of my friends crossed the bridge walking and from there we could see the smoke from the twin towers. Everyone was going CRAZY!. It felt like a bad dream. When i got to 207 i called my mother from a pay phone to make sure she was home and safe. when i called her she informed me that a woman we knew was in one of the towers and no one knew if she was alive. That womans husband works with my father and he(her husband) Left work as soon as this happened and left his car lost in the bronx and walked from there because no vehicles were being let through the bridge. He was also going crazy. Well after all this i got home and started watching the news all day. everything i saw was very shocking to me, especially to see people jumping out of windows on the very high floors, and seeing the towers collapse. It seemed unreal like a movie or something. in couldnt believe it. i also found out that another man i knew was in one of the towers too.    Although i wasn\'t close to these 2 people, i was saddened by their deaths...till this day of september 25th, they have not been found, and i feel fery sorry for their families. Overall i think this was an extremely cruel act on behalf of those terrorists, and i think that this incident unified the country. At the present moment i fear my life because those terrorists dont care about themselves or any one, and the latest news i heard was that they were threatning to infect the city with some kind of virus or gas that will kill off many people. This is a situation i would never want to face. I\'m praying to God it doesn\'t occur because im too young to die and i have alot of goals i want to achieve. I also would not like to see anything happen to my loved ones. Thats about all i have to say about this.\"They haventHatred and EnvyOsama\"My first perspective on the events of 9/11/01 was one of disbelief, it then shifted to anger, then numness and has now shifted to logic.

Of course, our media ties into this by loading Americans with this false sense that we, Americans, are a  good  nation. Do most Americans know what happened to Panamanian rebels after America withdrew? How many Americans know that Pres. Bush promised those rebels support? How many Americans know that Pres. Bush did that same thing in Saudi? It makes me sick to hear people say how we were wrongly attacked and that this is a terrible thing. Please! America has induced WAY MORE terror onto others. This payback was small as far as I\'m concerned. I expected nuclear attacks.\"I\'ve become considerably less optimistic about my future.The people who committed them.A number of factors: a desire to end the domineering global presence of the United States; a need to benefit from religious repression in the Arab countries; a desire to satisfy the ambition and lust for power on the part of the terrorists; and hatred in general.  \"Firstly, like any other rational person, I think, I am overwhlemed with emotions of shock, disbelief, horror, terror, grief, and sadness, at the senselessness of this enormous tragedy. There, having sounded like a politician, let me try to sound like myself: this was senseless and completely unforgivable, but it was *not* the act of madmen who didn\'t know what they were doing; and it pains me to say this, but the United States population has been acting as if we did nothing or said nothing to provoke other countries and their populations into hating us, or resenting us, and that\'s simply a lie. For at least fifty years, the intelligence community of our government has engaged in practices abroad that make the Mafia seem like principled, trustworthy characters by comparison: assassinating foreign leaders,  destabilizing  governments, rigging elections (a practice recently tried to great effect in our own national election last year), and so forth. There\'s no doubt we are a superb country, but we\'re not the only country, and though it may shock people to hear this, our way of life is not the only valid one, and millions of people have a right not to be exactly like us if that is their choice. The Bay of Pigs, the assassination of the Diem (sp?) brothers in Vietnam, the Iran-Contra scheme, and so forth: these are not isolated incidents: they speak to a conscious pattern of U.S government-sponsored interference with and damage to the sovereign affairs of foreign powers. Newton\'s Third Law of Human Behavior states that for every human action there is an equal and sometimes far from opposite reaction: you get back what you put out. If you keep on bullying other people, eventually one of them is going to want to try to hit you back. Nature abhors a vacuum; so, I think what happened is that these evil terrorists, be they Osama bin Laden and his confederates or not, swept into position to put forth their own murderous, despicable agendas, by way of  answering  what they perceived to be a  call  from their countrymen and women to defy this global bully, the United States. As for this shock and disbelief that we, of all peoples, could be harmed by terrorists, we as Americans need to grow up and accept the fact that we live in the same world as a lot of people who disagree with us, and that we should get over our feeling of being special, untouchable,  God\'s chosen country  or whatever. We\'re no better than anybody else, and the sooner we incorporate that into our behavior, the better citizens of this planet we\'ll make. We should absolutely put bin laden and his comrades out of business, permanently and in such a violent way as to take the fun out of terrorism for others who would practice it for all time, but as for going to war with Afghanistan, a country that sent both Britain and the USSR packing and bloodied, I think we\'d better tiptoe along the edges ofthat. The war in Iraq failed to achieve its unstated goals, of unseating Saddam Hussein, and probably created such anger and hatred towards the USA that it may have planted the seeds of this new conflict in the minds ofpeople like bin Laden and others. I\'m afraid of the children of people who are going to be killed in this conflict, growing up to nurse long-standing hatred towards us for this, and wanting to outdo bin Laden by hurting us even more the next time it happens, and I worry that there will be a next time. We seem to think we are removed from the cares of the world, as if America were Mount Olympus and its citizens were gods who could push the rest of the world around, and that just ain\'t so. I condemn wholeheartedly and without reservation the evil deeds committed in the name of a faith and a people who did not want this done to us; I have known many Muslims in my life, not a single one of them a vioolent or dangerous person, and while I am not a MUslim myself, and have no interest in becoming one, I do think we white European Christian types could improve ourselves and our relationships with others by learning about Islam and what it really stands for, and I already know it doesn\'t stand for killing thousands of people in a cowardly and barbaric fashion, so these terrorists don\'t fool me with their talk of jihad. Nor should we be fooled by President Bush\'s talk of a never-ending war on terrorism; this could well be used as an excuse to spend what little money our government has left, now that he\'s given away the Clinton surplus as a feel-good tax cut to the nation, to wage war not only on foreign terrorists but on the civil rtights and civil liberties of decent, law-abiding Americans who may happen to disagree with this government and its juvenile fascination with the military and gunplay, as if they were all little boys in a schoolyard woh think nonviolent discussion and resolution of real problems is a sissy answer. We\'re not little kids, we\'re adults, and we should all---the U.S., the Afghans, the Israelis and the Arabs, the Chinese andRussians and Brits, everybody else---start being adult and looking ast a modern, nonviolent, twenty-first century solution to this terrible mess we\'re all in. Our grandparents and parents got the world into this mess; we should push aside their failed strategies and find something that works better, for our time and our generation. I am, again, neither Arab nor Muslim, but I do not hate Arabs or Muslims; I am neither Jewish nor Christian, but I dot not hate them either; in fact, it\'s safe to say I don\'t hate anybody, but I do hate this tragedy and the deep, dark holw it\'s plunged the world into, and I want us all to make our way out of it and make things right, and there aren\'t enough cruise missiles in the world to bring back one single person who died on September 11. We need a better way to solve this problem.  Long live New York, and America. \"I feel it is a turning point in our country that might signal a new begginning or pride in America and of all Americans that has not been seen for decades. I also worry about what will happen next and how far this war will go. We need to go after these terrorists and should have gone after them a long time ago. Israel has finally been proven right in how to deal with terrorists and we should enlisttheir aid and let them use whatever force they must to stop terroism in their area. We cannot surpress them anymore though I fear President Bush will not allow them to do what is needed. Sept. 11 was a tragedy and a horrible wake up call. We will never be the same. While everyone says we need to get back  to normal  I have to wonder what is normal now ? I don\'t know if we can ever get back to the way things once were and think that  normal  is a term that still needs to be defined in this new age we are now living in.Terrorist networks originating in the Middle East .

I remembered the first WTC bombing and the plot to blow up the tunnels.  Every time I would go into the city I think about these events and wonder when the next time will be.  The WTC attack was a probability to me.  I was in traffic and tuned in to get the traffic report.  The traffic reporter interupted his report on what it looked like on the GWB to state that he had seen what looked to be a plane strike the WTC.  I immediately considered a purposeful act as the weather was perfect.  I knew. As things unfolded I was drawn to go down to the Ocean Parkway as I knew that the towers were visible on clear days.  I saw the plume of smoke, phoned my fiance and next, my parents in Kentucky (originally from New York).  On the way back I saw a pick-up with a big flag flying off the back and thought to myself that we will see flags all over the place ala Desert Storm. For the candle light vigil during which radio stations encouraged people to gather in front of their houses in a show of solidarity, my fiance sat in front of the colonial American flag which flies every day from our porch.  Leaning up against the bench upon which we sat were two assault rifles, a show of defiance.  We prayed and went inside. We visited ground zero two nights ago.  I will never forget the smell.  The feeling of being in a place where so many people perished reminded me of a visit I made to Dachau concentration camp.  The most powerful part was seeing cars covered with dust and debris several blocks away, obviously having belonged to victims. I am angry.\"I am taking advantage of cheaper airfare.

I have realized for years that being around large crowds and/or  high-value  locations does increase ones exposure to a potential terrorist attack, but in general, this realization does not normally alter my behavior to a large degree. I am dismayed by the reactions of many people who seem to be willing to trade any level of freedom in order to feel  safe . One can never truly be  safe . People need to learn to deal with that reality.\"I feel very bad about what happened. I believe these cowards should be caught and be put into jail.

Everyone should unite together so that we can have peace and can get through everything that is going on in the whole United States of America. The U.S. should take actions real fast and have more tighter security in the airports and all parts of the country. The day these terrorists attacks occured I thought of my father who works in Wall Street and near the World Trade Center. But I called him and he was alright and I was so happy to hear from him.  Not only was New York attacked but so was the Washington area in the Pentagon. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon at the same time other lives were being destroyed.  I really do not know how these people got into these planes with the knives as they said that they had so easily without nobody noticing that they had these weapons. This was terrible and many inocent lives were taken away. My last opinion about all this would be to arrest the criminals and make them face the death penalty.  To destroy lives and see them suffer and to show how strong they are.I really do not know but I belive there are many that are involved in the attacks.Ive been afraid a little.all of us\"It was a terrible event which shocked me a lot, because nobody has the right to proceed in this way.

Shot down any unauthorized air traffic. 11)  Repeal the 1976 act stating that we can not asassinate the heads of foriegn states or nations. 12)  Bring the Russians in as full partners with NATO to erradicate terrorism worldwide.  Working in close assocaition with the Russians, we must reward them for their efforts and involvement. 13)  Stop all tax rebates and increase our income tax by 2\% to pay for the war effort. 14)  Issue war bonds for Americans and our friends to invest. 15)  Bring the war on drugs in on this war on terrorism; illegal drugs are a form of terrorism of our population. Thank you for allowing me to express my opinions.  God Bless America and her legal citizens.\"\"it did not change, but I am staying 4000 miles east of Ney York City.\"\"Usama Bin Laden or related people, or US militias (e.g. guys like Timothy Veigh who bombed the government building in Oklahoma)\"\"I was completly shocked at that day, and I could not work (it was 3 a.m. local time).  Yesterday I taped a tv documentary with all the pics of the planes hitting WTC. Sometimes I still think I am just in a movie, but not in the real world.  I am deeply concerned what will happen next. Violoence/war is neither an appropriate answer nor will it solve any problems with terrorism. Also  President  (was he really elected) Bush must take much more care in international affairs. Isolationism will result in a world wide chaos.  The values of the western society (which is also shared by the vast majorites of muslims, too) require that the US do not longer support states or activities of states which do not meet democratic standards. In the past the US choosed allies which were against the common enemy (the Soviet Union), but not for democratic values.  The impact of the events will be that the next air travels will be much more time consuming, but I think it is necessary. In May I was in the US, and I was really astonished about what they call controls at the airport. In Europe the controls are much stricter. Maybe I am disorganised, but I think these terror acts will determine US national and international politics for a long time. Hopefully terrorism will vanish, but in Germany that lasted 20 years (the RAF, they wanted a revolution in Germany using violocende, killing representatives of the states and eceonomic leaders)   \"hate and fanatism\"I don\'t know, out of pure hatred I guess\"Ohsama Bin Lahden\"I was actually pulling into the parking lot of the college where I am attending when I first heard the news about the planes striking the World Trade Center towers, and at first thought I didn\'t give any attention to it because I assumed that it was due to some weather condition such as fog. But later after my first class that day I began hearing reports of other planes being hijacked and crashing into other areas of the U.S. Soon after that the school decided to post tv\'s around the various halls and, study rooms, and lounges in order for students to know what was going on. The first feeling I guess I had was fear, because no one new exactly what was going on and how many planes had been hijacked. The entire event reminds me that we live in a society where we are vulnerable to attack, that we\'re not invincable like so many of us believe we are. I don\'t believe that I ever felt revenge because the events never effected me personaly. My heart went out to those who lost loved ones, and my heart continues to go out to those families and people. I did feel a deeper sense of patriotism, and found it really encouraging that the country seemed to find that feeling also. But I am discouraged at the fact that it took a tragedy like this to ignite our sense of patriotism. I have a very deep respect now for the men and women in our police departments and fire departments who put their lives on the line daily to serve and protect. I feel that we have done an excellent job as a people and a  country of continuing on and triumphing through this tragedy. I think that it shows how the will to survive and thrive through circumstances and trials is a trait that all people share. I was upset at the outbreak of racism towards the people of Middle Eastern ethnicity living here in the U.S., and towards those who practiced Islam. I think there was no reason for any racism, and I was extremely upset at the media for showing video of children in Middle Eastern countries dancing and celebrating the tragedy. That in itself did not help race realtions one bit, and could have been left out of the media. Overall I feel a lot more vulnerable than I did before Sept. 11, which I guess is a feeing that I\'m going to need to learn to deal with because the world is not as safe as it once was, even on American soil.   \"\"Not much has changed, I have spent a lot more time in pray for the president and for those in charge.\"I understand from the media that Islamic terrorists are behind themIgnoranceNo change really ... just sadnessHaving been in the US on a number of occasions and having been in the Trade Centre and enjoyed the wonderful hospitality of Americans - my initial response was one of shock and disbelief - which gave way to immense saddnes and sense of horror at what people had experienced and were still experiencing as we watched. Deepest thoughts and feelings? How lost people who do such things are.  How \'care-less\' for people and order and freedom.  A profound sense of saddness which remained.  As a minister of a Presbyterian Church in NZ I held a special service the Sunday evening following where people came for the first time - some of them - and lit a candle and prayed and cried.  On the Wednesday morning - when we heard it in NZ - we hold a small communion service.  This morning those who came - including myself - wept as we saw in the symbols of broken bread and poured out wine - the sensless killing of the innocents in NY and Wash.

'they haven\'tOsama Bin Laden and his followers\"The September 11 attack on the United States was nothing more than a cowardly act of rage against the people of the United States.  It was not instigated by the U.S., nor was it brought upon the U.S. due to any kind of logical reason.  Osama Bin Laden, the likely culprit, and his followers apparently feel such hatred within their souls that they can somehow justify the taking of innocent, civilian life.  Apparently, just being an American citizen is, to Bin Laden and his followers, and act of complicity in what they consider to be an unjust system.        I suppose that efforts at peace-making and efforts at ending centuries old hatred offend Bin Laden.  I also suppose that he and his followers look at the United States culture as one where women are whores for exposing their hair and legs and one that allows too much freedom among its citizenry.      Well, that is too bad for Bin Laden.  Yes, the United States has sought peace and freedom for the people of the Middle East.  Yet this great nation has supported its many cultures, religious beliefs, and humane religious practices.  And, in nations that are ruled by a calice dictatrial regime, we have not placed blame on its civilians, nor have we considered them complicit.  Instead, we have been nothing less than a catalyst for freedom.        If it is freedom that Bin Laden despises, I have no sympathy.  Too many brave men have fought to ensure freedom to the people of the world, as well as the rest of the world.  Frankly, if Bin Laden hates the U.S. for that, I have no sympathy.  And, when he chooses to attack us on our native soil, he has gone too far.  In his attack of terror on the U.S., whether they be at the U.S.S. Cole, the World Trade Center, or the Pentagon, Bin Laden has gone one step too far.      He must be stopped.  He must be taken dead or alive.  He must not be allowed to take one more life.  He must be stopped in his genocidal activity.  The U.S. must take him. \"For one simple reason: hate\"a silly questions.  The chain of responsibility is long, with many links to history, ignorance, US foreign policy, etc.\"\"First feelings: Shocked and saddened but not surprised. Subsequent feelings: I wish Americans would be more aware of other cultures, of other histories and of the harm that so much of its self-centred American foreign policy does to much of the world.  The terrorist attacks were inexcusable.  But half of the motives for undertaking them are based on legtimate concerns about the effects of American foreign policy on local cultures.  The other half, of course are based on self-interest and on ignorance of the US that is as appalling as US ignorance of other cultures.  Two wrongs don\'t make a right.  While terrorists are being attacked, so too might the lack of understanding and respect that leads both sides to hate each other.\"0\"To get attention, to be feared when there no more hope of being respected.\"I have come to understand that a common view of some foriegn nations is that the US is arrogant and selfish.0terrorists\"There is no doubt in my mind that the tragic events of September 11th must be dealt with and have had a huge impact on our society as a whole.  My biggest fear, however, is that we will retaliate in such a manner that will be  an eye for an eye .  This is a method of retaliation that I strongly disagree with.  A simple exchange of killing innocent people is not an answer to our current problem, yet most people I talk to seem to think it is inevitable.\"Deep ConvictionI feel that the two elements struck  money and power  the  WTC\'s and the Pentagon  were selected because represent Americas oppression of small countries.  There is plenty of history of Amarica supporting a government for American $$ interests (an example is the African Congo)rather than Humanitarian interests.  I feel that Bush has rushed us into a war that is not going to help us.  It seems like the educated minds were still pondering the events of the 11th when the  Rush In  segement of America announced War!  My thought is this:  Would Christ or Buddha have bombed those who are believed to be responsible.  No way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How is it that this country claims to be Christian but doesn\'t follow Christ?  \"America- We killed 500,000 Iraq children with our trade embargo.

'\"nothing really, except a sort of slight depression that is beginning to wane, sympathy, increased patriotism and tolerance for everybody around.  in fact i don\'t even mind annoying commercials or crappy tv shows, since i guess everybody needs to make their living.  howdy sherlock ;)\"\"i think its important to be as objective and honest with ourselves as possible to try and understand the source of this hatred for america.  at first i was shocked and angry, and still feel that way whenever i think about it.  to be quite honest, i think its really natural for many people to be wary of muslims in this country right now.  of course the terrorists in this country make up a fringe group and its not fair to single out muslims.  my feeling, however, is that muslims could possibly try to do more to make sure that there no one in there ranks is being dishonest (i.e., is a potential terrorist) and trying to blend in with other muslims.  i believe this is happening and i think this hurts their image.  this is a politically incorrect view, but i think its valid.  people are naturally paranoid right now, and the muslims in america should do something to aquit themselves.  is this unfair that someone would say they need to prove themselves?  yes, its unfair.  and no one is going to request that they do anything.  i just wish they would take it upon themselves to help change their image in this country, as well as helping to change the image of america to people back in the middle east.  middle eastern propaganda indicts american muslims as well as everybody else.  condemning the attacks and expressing revulsion may, unfortunately, not be enough for some people in this country.  muslims are very mis-understood in this country, and that is the basis for stereotyping people and for mis-trust.  in a nutshell i think i\'m saying it would help if the muslim community in this country would help us all to know who they are and what they stand for, help make sure there aren\'t people posing as peaceful muslims when they are not, and help improve the image of america to muslims in the middle east.  i may be dead wrong about all of this.  if i am, i would like very much to be set straight.  \"terrorists associated with bin laden\"america represents a way of life that has been impossible to achieve in some middle eastern countries, breeding poverty.  we also support israel, police other countries (necessarily, i think).  we also tolerate many things they cannot (gays, women who do as they please, etc.), as they are fundamentalists in the sense that personal freedoms are not valued.  deep religous beliefs in the face of severe poverty and perceived unfairness can make any patriotic person believe wacky things.  \"\"I\'ve called my family more often, and have definitely not been as cheerful and happy as I usually am.  I think this is only temporary, but nonetheless, it\'s not my normal behavior.  \"Many countries dislike and are bitter toward the US because they say we bully the rest of the world and try to enforce our views on them.  The fanatics and psychos take this one step farther and do horrible things like this\"I don\'t know who is to blame for the acts, but speculation points to Bin Laden.  Until there is proof, I really can\'t point fingers at anyone in particular\"\"Every time I turn on the television and I see something related to the events of last week, I literally get choked up and start to cry.  I just cannot believe that it\'s all real.  I can\'t believe that in the matter of minutes, thousands of people lost their lives to a tragic end!  My mom has been ill with Cancer almost all of my life, so I\'ve never had the luxury of taking her for granted, like most people do.  These events have made it even more apparent for me just how easily and how fast our loved ones can be taken away from us.  One minute they can be here, then next minute they\'re gone!  More than ever, I just want to be with my family (my mom) right now.  I just want my mom to hold me and let me know that everything\'s going to be alright.  Unfortunately, at the moment it\'s not possible.  Because of this, I\'ve been depressed the past week.  I go to college away from home, so I can\'t be with my family or loved ones.  I even called my ex-boyfriend, who\'s working in Japan, and I cried to him, telling him how much I miss him and my family, and how lonely I feel for them!  It was kind of an unexpected moment, but letting it out helped me.  He\'s always been good at that.  For Thanksgiving, I was planning on flying home to see my mom, but now she wants me to drive instead, but the drive\'s almost 15 hours!  I still plan on flying.  I\'m not going to let this terrible tragedy keep me from a normal life, even flying home to see my family! If anything, it\'s made me feel more proud to be an American.  In other countries, when things like this happen, riots and more violence follow, but here in the US it seems like we just bonded together and are now doing whatever is possible to console those who lost their loved ones.  Like I said, every time I see the ruins of the attack, or even if I see a US flag, I get choked up, and a tear escapes.  It\'s an unbelievable thing that\'s happened, and from what I hear, it\'s not nearly over.  I keep hearing rumors of a third world war and it scares the hell out of me, but we have to seek justice.  One thing that really pisses me off are those US religious  leaders  who are pointing fingers at certain groups within our country, blaming them for what happened last Tuesday.  In a time when we need desperately to band together and help each other out, those blasphemous bastards are wedging their way in and trying to take political advantage of the situation.  For them to say that God let this happen because we deserved it just appalls me!  It makes me ashamed to be associated with them.  They\'re the antithesis of what Christian leaders should be!  No country deserves what happened to us, and God would not let this happen.  This was a horrible act by horrible people in an attempt to deface us, but I believe it won\'t work.  We can\'t let them think they knocked us down.  We\'ll have to be like one of those heroes in the action movie:  wipe the blood from our mouth, smile at our opponent, then kick his ass!  \"\"I was completely shocked by the scale and method of the attacks on New york and Washington. I have every sympathy with the families of those killed or injured in the attacks. I am concerned that the inevitable military response from the USA will potentially make future attacks more likely if they are not part of a measured approach. While a world wide campaign targetted against terrorism is to be applauded, the political leaders of the USA have to realise that their policies of the past have contributed to their demonisation in certain quarters of the World community. \"Islamic extremists00\"I actually don\'t have too much in the way of thoughts on the events of 9/11.  Although I have not isolated myself from the incident and it\'s reporting, I try not to get too caught up in all of what is happening and what is being reported about it.  I feel that the more I focus on the issue, the larger it becomes in my personal reality and that is something I wish to avoid.  I don\'t feel I know the answers around the situation, and feel in the end, the ultimate reality, it is all part of a great evolutionary process and will proceed as it does with or without my particpation.\"Not much.Mankind.Everytbody does what they think is right given the circmstances of their situation.Religious fanatics.\"hate, need for revenge, religious teachings\"\"It is a disaster caused by some deranged religious nuts.

If we are unable to live in peace, and I am thinking that we are, at least we should find a way to express these hostilities in a more civilized fashion.  Now it is time for revenge.

I was shocked, these kind of footage I could only see on movies and now it\'s a reality nightmare. As I watch the news I think about how the people die on the plane and the people die in the building. It\'s scary! I thought I was living in a peaceful country.

Now you see the horrors those of us in the UK have put up with for 30 years, and our pissant Prime Minister has bared the country\'s backside in readiness for America to take advantage.

I feel violated because I grew up in the shadow of the towers as a young man.  I watched them grow and understood the importance and significance of their presence in the New York skyline.  I feel as if someone has broken into my home and attempted to take away my home and my livelihood, my friends and my family.  It angers me in that although these attacks may not have been avoided, it is apparent that our ability to identify individuals and groups capable of this kind of act has deminished since the cold war and terrorism has not been taken seriously because it has not been identified with a specific nation but rather individuals who we thought incapable of this level of terror.  We have underestimated the enemy and the result is massive loss of life and property.  There is no front line and there is no identified nation and hence our approach to dealing with terrorism must change and yet I don\'t know that it will.  You would think from our experiences in WW II in the pacific and the war in Vietnam that we would realize that battlelines are not always specifically defined.  In Vietnam the enemy was among us.  The young barber cutting hair during daylight hours was the enemy sniper tied to a tree taking American lives under darkness.  So to with terrorist.  They find there way into our society and becaome responsible citizens by day and destroy life and property by night.  When fighting terrorism we must take a gorilla warfare approach to dealing with this enemy and I am angry that our leaders have not understood this and taken appropriate action in dealing with the problem.  My fear now is that we here in the US are so infiltrated by these terrorist that identifying them will be even more difficult than before.  The time for passive/aggressive approaches is over.  We can no longer take the approach that if we know who they are and where they are that we can control their ultimate intents and outcomes.  We must take an aggressive approach to this problem.\"The world powers who refused to address this issue vigorously prior to this event.Strong and manical committment to their religous and polical beliefs and opposition to those who believe otherwise.\"Up to this point not much since the numbness has yet to wear off.

Its life-long self-oriented and egoistic policy will cause more and more that kind of attacks in the future, and the people of the USA will probably just wonder why, because it is a totally incomprehensible thing for US (not American, you really are not the whole continent) people that there could be someone in this world who doesn\'t LOVE the good ol\' US of A. USA is a country, population of which makes up 5\% of the population of the whole world, they use 1/3 of all natural resources and produce 1/2 (yeah, half) of all the garbage, waste and litter of the world. It is also the only country in the world, which has such things as a Hamburger University and the University of the Paranormal. That explains the curious fact, how on earth it is possible that there are University Graduates in the USA. These things  should ring the bell in the minds of the US people, but no: as long as there is Coke and the Disneyland and the cars consume 12 litres (if you don\'t know how many gallons that is, it\'s your problem) on 100 km(- -in miles) on average, everything must be well in The Land of the Free, where prisons are filled with people under eighteen and where death-sentence is in active use. \"\"Well, um, let\'s see....

Last ones to be suspected are, of course, the people who would most benefit from the western worlds\' condemnation of the islamic countries and who would very much like to see the attention of the worlds\' media to turn away from their nazi-comparable internal policy. But, because you (the Free) have armed, fed and equipped them for half a century, it wouldn\'t be very nice to tell the taxpayers that they have actually financed the WTC-attack themselves, you\'d better find the guilty party from more comfortable direction.

This terrorist act killed thousands of innocents and it makes me feel very sad. But i feel very bad also to see that people gather so quickly around their flag.

Over the next few days I wondered who would do this, who stood to profit and found the speed at which the FBI gathered their \'evidence\' somewhat incredible. It took 4-6 years to work out what happened in the Lockerbie Air bombing. My actual feelings at this time were absolute fear of what America would do in response. Those fears have NOT diminshed greatly as the world sits on the brink of a crusade Vs a Jihad. I am afraid for the innocent  victims of greater suffering due to retaliation. I am afraid of being  sucked in to another world war. I am ultimatley afraid that the human  race may be passing up it\'s last chance to survive the ecological  runaway train we\'ve already set in motion. I believe the concept depicted by the Author Isac Asimov in his story  \'Foundation\' where our society goes through \'tidal flows\' of  civilisation and technology. I also believe there are only a finite  number of chances to \'get it right\' before our planet becomes part  of our sun. The tidal flow may also be as extreme as the planet being striped back to basic \'amoeba\' in another huge ice age where life  would have to evolve again before it could get to grips with science. I fear that some high ranking political group in America could have executed this plan in order to channel the American public in to a war frenzy which they can aim at anyone they like. Bush wasn\'t exactly a popular choice of leader before this was he ?  It reminds me of Hitler\'s \'leg up\' to power when he blamed the burning of the Reichstag on the communists, ousted them and united Germany in a surge of Nationalism.  Everybody in the League of Nations appeased Hitler to avoid war and  allowed him to re-unite most of the Austro-hungarian empire before finally declaring his re-patriotism of Poland an invasion. The world is scared and many people are prepared to do Americas biding because they agree that the attack on the WTC was atrocious and  despicable. They do not want to be seen to condone it. The same fear runs through the American public, as it did the German public in 1938. No one can speak out against the calls for \'Justice\'. I don\'t believe the CIA findings. The US are on a power trip that  they haven\'t been able to indulge in since Vietnam. 92\% of the U.S.  want war and they have a universally accepted excuse to point the finger at whoever they like, including any government they decide is harbouring a terrorist. This is a chance to tip the power balance of the world big time and most nations are prepared to \'appease\'  the U.S.  - I hope you guys listen to the rest of us when we say  \'enough\' and the world doesn\'t have to go to war with America ! I am saddened by the human loss and suffering of the attack, but I don\'t rate Americans above the rest of the world. People are dying and suffering in their millions because of political situations the U.S. government has had more than a small hand in.  Afghanistan is a mess - don\'t bomb it, help it. I want less stick, more carrot. I wish people could grow more empathy and understanding from the attack and use it to make a global peace and co-operation never before seen - not to hate everyone whose got half a reason to complain about what America has done in the past then go and kick shit out of them. Still, I\'ll be dead sometime in the next 40 years, most probably with no offspring - why should I care what the human race does ?

I have come to think that whilst nobody directly involved in the events in any way deserved to be affected (i.e. killed, bereaved, traumatised, etc.), the United States as a whole is not entirely blameless. The cause of this tragedy needs to be examined, even though this will further affect those most involved since they will possibly see dialogue between the attackers and the US government as insensitive.\"Not at all.Through a misunderstanding of the intention of US foreign policy.',3,-5,0,2,5,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.69,0,10.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.07,1.69,0,1.69,5.06,0,0,1.69,5.06,0,0,0,5.07,0,0,2.53,0,35.47,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.76,3.38,0,5.06,0,0,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.83,9.29,3.38,1.69,0,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.69,0,0,0.84,Male49b
'SameNone. Time is a remedy for the pain. The question is: do people will have the time to forget before another attack ?\"A lot of anger against the terrorists. Also, against the US gov. I mean, in France, we\'ve stayed all the afternoon, looking the TV. It was really inbelievable to see these symbols of the human greed and pride crushing in a cloud of dust; a kind of bad movie... too much realistic, frightening. Few minutes before, i was listening the radio, speaking the attentat against the WTC; but my first thought was that they were talking about the first one !  After, when we have been informed of the mechanic of the terrorist act, we\'ve think that:  - The US gouvernement has supported the muslims (Afghans and others) fanatics, providing them money, tactical advices and weapons to fight against the dying USSR. It was a real blindness because US has never mesured the danger of the muslim religion... much more dangerous than communism (don\'t even try to say that you are a christian or to show a cross in the Emirats). - Nothing has been done to stopped the well known terrorists groups, allowing some of their members to live and to get a pilot training on the US territory. - The biggest insult is that they have used US training to pilot one US plane to threaten with a US cutter (probably) to force the US plane to crash on US buildings...  The words are useless. The TV shows, little candles and flowers are irrelevant facing this declaration of war. Just emotion and compassion quickly moving to anger. Fanatics live to make the will of God... even if  God does not agree... I guess that mankind of the XXIth century must to forget the walfare of the modern comfort. The times are changing.

I spend my time grieving.  I talk to my children more and do anything I can for them.  I question what is my purpose for the remainder of my life.\"I am deeply troubled that human beings could intentionally kill so many.  I have difficulty pondering how a group of men could so soley focus on harming others.  The pain of this group or the twisted logic is beyond my comprehension.  I was sitting at my desk in WTC1 when the plane hit.  I will not stop grieving for all of the human losses and complications created by this destruction.  I am sad. I  wrote this on Sunday, 9/16. Yesterday was tough.  I wanted to return to NYC to see the Wall of Prayer and the memorials.  I had a want to get out from under the TV onslaught and to see the humanity for myself.  For those of you who don\'t know the details, I live in Queens and worked in an office on the 23d floor southwest in the World Trade Center Building One.  Yes, I was there on Tuesday, ironically reading about a Terrorist turned Teacher just arrested in Mt. Vernon, NY for an airplane hijacking from Canada to Cuba back in the early 70\'s.  The article was in the Tuesday, NY Times and I was reading it at the moment that the Building was hit.  The first word that popped in my head was terrorist.  But, I didn\'t know what that meant and I didn\'t imagine how that was being applied. The fear was horrible, the screams and expressions on co-workers faces was terrifying.  Suddenly everything taken for granted was shaking.  Though I have a great view of the Hudson River, I chose not to go to my window. Somehow I didn\'t take the steps to the outer part of my office space. Instead, I looked caddie corner through the glass of another office.  I saw debris falling.  I saw the roof of a smaller building a few blocks south of the trade center on fire.  I didn\'t understand how my building could shake and a building in that distance could be on fire.  My attention turned to the screaming co-workers.  I put on facilitator hat and sought calm.  Let\'s get on the ground resonated from my head like the teachers taught us in 1950\'s elementary schools. I called a security number and they thought possibly it was an earthquake. Direction on how to proceed wasn\'t forthcoming yet.  And then our floor fire marshall said they want us to go down the stairs.  We descended to the stairs, and the first stairway was full of people and stagnant.  A woman who was around us, said  let\'s go to another emergency exit.   We went.  A woman stepped out of the stairwell.  I tried to stop her.  She said that she couldn\'t breathe with all the people.  She had to get out.  I don\'t know what became of her.  We moved down the flights of stairs actually with a certain calm.  Some had messages that we had been hit by a plane, and then it was 2 planes.  I listened but didn\'t dwell.  We were stopped at times in the stairwell, waiting to move again. We worked well together making our way down to what\'s now known as Ground Zero.  A few people\'s health showed to be suffering in the slightly smoky stairwell.  Someone provided paper towels and others shared their water to wet the cloths so that we could breathe through the walk down.  We encouraged those showing visible signs of suffering to make their way down the stairs faster.  2 or 3 people with escorts came down from higher floors being announced as burn victims.  We just made space so they could pass.  We were respectful.  Also, very aware that they were able to walk but walking in pain and with singed skin.  No one spoke of what horrors might be above us. Firemen started coming up the stairs.  We were asked to move to the right to let them pass.  Like any chain gang we sent the messages up or down as needed.  Hauling heavy gear, wearing their protective but weighty clothes, they passed us one by one.  Trying to be positive they told us we were close and that we would make it out.  They said the air would get better.  Around the 10th or 11th floor, a fireman said to his leader,  we need to stop and rest,  we are going to need our strength.   His leader said  yeah, to fight the fire.   My co-worker, in the stairwell below me looked at me when the  fire word was mentioned.  It penetrated our silence about the conditions.  Still we didn\'t speak of this.  We continued going down, as the firemen went up...  Three firefighters in civilian clothes followed the uniformed firefighters.  One of the civilian dressed said,  let me carry some of your gear, you\'ve got a lot to carry.   And with a deep understanding smile, he won over some of the uniformed officer\'s load.  It was symbolic of a fraternity\'s commitment to one another and the higher purpose of serving others.  Probably 30 to 40 firefighters passed us on the steps. The last seven or eight floors were filled with water.  If ever their was a time to not  wear high heels - this was it.  Too late for some.  Others took off their shoes or sandals and walked bare foot.  The rest of us got wet. We made it down.  The West St. side of the building was unrecognizable.  The lobby was a shambles.  Water poured all over us.  Security personnel stood every 30 yards and kept herding us out -  faster, faster, and then we were out of the building.  FRESH AIR.  We left by the Borders Bookstore exit, and we moved towards Broadway.  Someone in my group said look back, and at that moment I saw fires burning and encircling each of the towers.  Joe, who made it out of the building with us said, the people up there are never going to make it out.   Grimness became real.  Reporters were already on the scene.  A woman reporter descended on a woman crying and leaning against the grate of a church cemetery west of Broadway. I didn\'t want to be fodder for the reporter\'s cannon. We moved towards City Hall Park, joining others looking for their co-workers.  Police were everywhere.  Emergency vehicles were descending from all directions.  A woman asked where I worked.  She watched the first plane hit. She was in a cab on the East Side Drive en route to work on the 104th floor of Building Two.   By the time they had turned on to West St. - the second building had been hit.  She worked for Cantor Fitzgerald.  We both looked up at the burning buildings and the pace and expanse of what was on fire had increased substantially from the time I first looked 5 to 10 minutes before. I kept to myself, Joe\'s message that it wasn\'t going to be promising for her peers.  We separated and I found some lawyers from my company.  We talked. One said, that he remembered that when our company, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, considered moving to the World Trade Center, an executive said that she was afraid of height and that she would only go - if we moved to lower floors.  If this is true, I owe her a kiss and a hug because this might have been the difference for myself and many of my peers. While standing with the lawyers, suddenly the ground shook.  I looked up and disbelief was transformed - I thought all of these buildings could fall down.  The building must have been falling.  I was afraid the ground could become a crater with all of us in it.  I looked down lower Broadway and saw a humongous black cloud of smoke moving north on Broadway.  I thought it was going to take over all of us.  It looked like it was moving fast, faster then we could get away from it.  I didn\'t know if there was fire behind it.  I, and everyone around me, started running for our lives.  People were screaming, falling, losing shoes and just attempting to get away.  I ran for blocks.  I had thought about throwing down my bag and wondered if that would add a few steps to be the difference in my get away.  I held on.  I slowed when I saw a woman moving her belongings in an oversized portable suitcase. She tugged her load.  I looked back.  I could walk.  I stepped slowly.  I kept looking back.  I wanted to know where the black cloud was.  New Yorkers met the devil.  Our faces told many stories.  We crowded around trucks with radios sharing the details of what was known.  I learned that the Pentagon had been hit as well.  We all walked for miles. People started reaching out to others.  Cell phones didn\'t work.  Long lines stood by pay phones.  At about `11 am, I called my wife and ended her hysteria.  I met a co-worker originally from Croatia, who said that by 10 am, his wife had received phone calls from Croatian friends and relatives to find out if he was still alive.  I saw this really muscular guy walking down the street crying.  I stopped at the first bar I could find and had some scotch.  I needed to let go of some of my defenses.  Tears started to shake out of me, as I watched a TV replay the tale.  I wanted to give blood.  I walked over to a hospital.  A few hundred stood outside the hospital waiting to give blood.  I discovered that if you had been drinking that you couldn\'t give blood.  I continued walking. I walked to 34th st and third avenue.  I saw a sign that said, police rides to Queens at 36th st and 2nd ave.  At about 1:30pm, I got a ride in an SUV through the Mid-Town tunnel to a bus that I could take to my house.  Once inside I cried and cried.  At about 3:20 pm, the phone rang.  Michelle asked if I could pick her up down the street at Mark\'s house.  My independent 10 year-old, said  Daddy, I don\'t want to walk down the street alone.   Innocence lost. The first two days after the building\'s had fallen, I cried  mostly for the firemen that went up in the inferno and gave their lives for the me\'s of the world.  I will never forget their bravery, sacrifice and commitment to their profession. Folks have been tremendously kind and supportive. And I say thanks.  This leads me back to how I started this message.  On Saturday afternoon, I grew very anxious as I got ready to leave for NYC.  I needed to get out of my house.  I couldn\'t wait for anyone.  I couldn\'t get behind the wheel to drive.  I wanted to move slowly.  I didn\'t know what to expect.  I wanted to take a train.  Reeva offered to drive.  We made it to the city pretty easily.  Parked on 28th st and 3d ave.  We walked over to Bellview Hospital and the Wall of Prayer.  We were entering a new zone.  Photos, words, and hope greet prayers.  I was drawn to view and read them all.  I came upon a woman\'s picture from my company.  Oh no, Vivian hadn\'t been found.  I sobbed and sobbed.  I just stayed with her picture.  Two grief counselors walked over to me.  I tried to understand why she didn\'t make it.  I saw on the notice that she had 3 children.  That weighed heavily on me.  The grief counselors delivering their street service to me were helpful.  I acknowledged my pain. I offered my hope.  And I moved on to sense more of how our family of New Yorkers, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Muslim, Jew, Christian, Catholic had been affected.  It is special to see a healing community spontaneously emerge to meet the needs of people feeling so much pain.  The street and entrance to the hospital were no longer the cold, boring entrance way to despair. Candles dripping, flowers, bouquets, water and charms adjoined the pictures, descriptions and phone numbers.  People offered to be of service to each other in whatever ways were needed.  New Yorkers were responding to anyone who needed assistance.  I have even stopped saying negative things about Rudi Guillianni.  I think that he has been an outstanding leader in this time of crisis.  I think he has risen to the occasion.  His pettiness has left his communications.  Family members were doing something about their situations. Bravo! I came upon 2 other Empire people that I didn\'t know who were also missing..       More pain. Right before we left the wall of Prayer , I came upon the picture of the fellow employee from Empire, who chose to remain with the quadriplegic employee.  Once, I had learned that their were people missing from Empire, my mind scanned those that I could recall.  I realized that the man who lived in a wheel chair, who breathed through tubes and did his keyboard work through some facial apparatus - would have no way to escape if he had arrived at work on time or early.  He always had an aide with him.  I wondered what happened to the aid and what thoughts was she now living with.  And how could this other physically healthy person in his fifties make such a humane and I project sacrifice?  I tried to talk to my wife about this, but it was more then she could listen to.  I knew that I wanted the grief counselors and within seconds, they showed up.  I brought them to the picture and asked if I could talk about this fellow\'s heroic action.  They listened and offered condolence and the concept of mercy.  I grew stronger by seeing the face of this man from Empire who put his friendship above his life.  I didn\'t know either of these men but I had a deep curiosity about their strength and convictions.  How many of us could do what the friend had done? We walked past the Armory where the family\'s searching were waiting.  We continued to Union Square Park.  People all along the way offered food, drink and nourishment. The memorial at Union Square was a throwback to the late sixties. Love and creativity exuded.  Tibetans drummed, art and poetry lifted spirits.  A version of London\'s Hyde Park shone through as debaters crowded to share points of view.  New life is emerging in NYC.  Out of the ashes, friendship and acceptance seem to be showing through. I\'m still crying at times.  I have worries.  I want to control things that I ordinarily don\'t think about but I\'m also better.  Stronger.   I want to go back to work.   I want to continue to serve others and share the inspirational stories that highlight these hard times.  I know that the world faces a difficult future but I am heartened by the signs in our streets of people shedding their boundaries to reach out and help someone.  This miserable destruction has given birth to a tapestry of friendship in this great city. My 3 children (almost 11, 14 and 19) have all grown in different ways from the tragedy.  They represent a diversity of political views, and share a new sensitivity and maturity about helping others. What ever you can do to help others is appreciated.  Find that spark of inspiration in you and touch others.

In spite of seeing the TV pictures, I can\'t seem to get my mind around the enormity of what was down.  I hesitate to say this, but in a strange way, I almost admire what the hijackers achieved.  If it weren\'t for the horrendous loss of life, I could almost feel the thrill that I imagine the plotters must have felt when they actually caused the towers to fall.  I disagree with Bush, these weren\'t cowards.  They were clearly brave even if fanatical and crazy.  A coward wouldn\'t kill himself to achieve this goal.  The whole thing feels surreal to me.  It reminds me of Apocalypse Now -- if you can believe it, I saw the  redux  version of the movie the night before the attacks.  In Apocalypse Now there\'s a similar sense of vicarious thrill to the power of destruction during the helicopter attack with Wagner playing.  That is, until we see the human destruction as people are cut down, including women and children.  I also worry about some American who seem ready to attack and persecute all arabs and all muslims.  I hope we don\'t just perpetuate the violence by indiscriminately attacking civilians in Afghanistan.  \"Anger with the US\'s policies.No change except for a feeling of greif for the Americans who lost their lives and their familes.Depraved Retaliation.\"  Chickens Coming Home To Roost   One more thought:  Clear Large Lots - In Both Camps, Because Burial Grounds will be in demand.\"Zealots.I just feel bad about what happened.Cause they hate Americans and its true we should let others kill each other but regulate to a point.Those damm towel heads need to pay for this shit!!!!The USA for even thinking and training Bin Laden and now that we are against him hes using the weapons on us which we gave to him to fight against The former Soviet Union.',4,-4,0,2,5,0.59,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,1.19,0,0.59,0.59,0,7.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0.59,0.59,0,0,0,0,1.78,2.97,0,1.19,4.46,0,0,0,2.67,0,0,0,2.08,0,0.59,0,0,21.96,0,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.55,2.97,0,5.05,0,1.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.93,11.59,0,0,0,0,1.18,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0.59,0,0,1.49,Male49b

It always breaks my heart when so many innocent people are killed, and my heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims.

I would hope that events such as this one will open the eyes of people everywhere and make them realise that hatred never does anyone any good, and that it will only lead to more hatred, which always results in the suffering of the innocent. the american people should realise that they are not alone in their sorrow and anger. but they should not act out of anger, but rather reach out to everyone who desires peace and is tired of all the mindless hatred that we humans seem to breed so readily.

The over-exploitation of the video and photo pictures by the news media also disgusted and hurt me. Many people around me are saying that the US should have expected something like this after their history with Afghanistan, Osama Bin Laden and the middle east. I believe that the US does not deserve these attacks because they uphold (mostly) the principles of freedom and human rights, on their own shores and, although sometimes wrongly, in other countries. I am worried that an ill-concieved or hasty retaliation by the US could have far reaching consequences that will eventually affect my life directly.

On the one hand, I feel sadness and grief for the victims and their families.  I am at least equally moved, however, by the many acts of heroism ranging from: (a) the NY firefighters trying to climb all those flights of stairs with very heavy equipment, if not certain that they were racing to their deaths, they must have realized that it was at least a good possibility, (b) the individuals aboard the flight that went down in Pennsylvania who must have overpowered the hijackers to make sure that others did not also lose their lives, to (c) the stories of individuals in the WTC who helped others in their firms to get out until it was too late to get out themselves or the fellow who stayed with and tried to help his quadripelegic friend and ended up dying with him rather than getting out himself, etc.  The fact that the terrorists could do such a horrible act only goes to show what awful things humans - and I do mean all of us - are capable of; to me, this merely serves to shed light on the nobility of the heroic acts - heroic acts are choices, we are not robots who are programmed only to do good, when we do good we do so as choices over more base impulses and urges. Am I fearul?  Will I stop flying?  No, I believe that most of us live life with the implicit illusion that tomorrow is guaranteed.  But tomorrow is not guaranteed, never was (not even before these horrible attacks) and never will be.  Life is a terminal illness and we take risk every day by getting out of bed.  No, to the contrary, I believe that events like these can serve as reminders that life is to be celebrated while we can and that we should make the most out of every moment so that we will not die with regrets whenever that might be.  I only wish that so many of us, myself included, did not need such sad and paniful events like these to remind us of this truth. One final word is that I know from your email you believe that views are changing over time but the views and feelings I expressed above are those that I have had pretty much from the outset (I have given interviews to this effect if you would like documentation).\"Islamic fundamentalists probably including Osamah bin Laden but undoubtedly many others as well',3,-4,0,2,5,0,7.11,0,0,0,0.89,0,1.78,0,0,1.78,0,18.67,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.89,4.45,0,1.78,5.33,0,0,0,8.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,0,7.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,74.67,7.11,0,7.11,0,0,0,4.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.55,10.67,1.78,0,0,0,5.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.44,0,0,0,Male49b

The real responsibility lies with a small handful of individuals who no doubt possesthe following attributes: they command a degree of authority and respect; they utilise a degree of religious mandate; have access to LOTS of money; ability to give people the conviction that they are doing the right thing; have no sense of respect for other\'s lives or humanity (sociopathy) I understand that BinLaden is considered a suspect and this seems very likely, although it could well be others??\"Osama Bin Laden and his helpers.I now have re-current dreams about the attacks and I feel greatley sad about this. I find myslef thinking about what could happen to us in the future but I trust our leaders and poloticians will not let us down again.

I am a 17 year old reident of Oklahoma and when I saw those pictures of the WTC It reminded me ofthe bombing we had here just a few years ago. I was much younger than but still I remember. I continue to have nightmares to this day about New York and Washington. I will serve my country in any way possible should they start a draft. But I would like to say that pointing the finger at the muslim community or anyone else except the terorists themselves makes the accuser just as bad as Osama. The only people we should blame are those that did it. My blessings go out to America and all those here in America that has been affetced, and to all our politicol leaders: may they be guided to do what is rigt and help re-build not only New York but also the hearts of every one world wide.\"I donot want to glorify the terrorists or make it apear that way but they were doing what they though was right. Just like anybody else. But as an American I think they did wrong and it is our turn to do what we think is right.\"To share their point of view with the rest of the world, and as revenge, from misconceptions about what is right and wrong.\"\"I could not believe what I heard when my friend called my about the WTC accident. This disbelief became stronger and stronger as he updated me about the second attack (as I learned when I was redecorating my house). I knew it would change the world\'s view on peace, and I felt \'excited\', not nervous, and above all curious about what happened/will happen\"\"I look at TV more frequently, keep myself updated.

'\"The terrorists themselves are directly responsible, but those who indoctrinated them into a violent form of Islam are even more responsible. The U.S. government is more distally responsible due to its meddling in the affairs of other countries.\"\"My initial reaction on the day this happened was shock, disbelief, and confusion. I just could not believe that this could happen. I felt some anger towards the perpetrators,  but not nearly the amount of anger expressed by people around me, who were demanding  that we begin retaliation immediately. I felt some sympathy and sadness for those who  lost family and friends and for people who worked or lived in Manhatten and felt so  violated. Over the next week or so, I kept trying to figure out why this would happen  and how we might best respond to prevent things like this from happening again. I spent  hours on the Internet, reading what others were saying about the causes of the tragedy  and what we should do in response. I continued to feel confused and numb, not knowing  what to do. The only thing I thought I knew was something we shouldn\'t do, which would  be to immediately launch a counter-attack that could escalate into a war. I offered a  few posts of my own on message boards, suggesting it might be wise to use restraint.  Nobody responded. I noticed that people were really caught up in trying to demonstrate  that they had the best analysis of the situation and the best solutions. Some people were  beginning to attack each other\'s ideas as stupid or immoral. I began feeling more hopeless  and depressed. I finally posted a message on a board, basically stating that even if  someone on the discussion list presented the absolutely best analysis and solution for  this problem, what would be the point, because the White House did not subscribe to this  discussion list. That essentially stopped the discussion, which soon turned back to the  topics the list was supposed to discuss. But one last comment made me really sad. It came  from a woman from California who said she wondered whether her 4-year daughter would live  to adulthood, and said that an anonymous stalker was sending her threatening emails in  response to a previous post she wrote, suggesting that U.S. foreign policy is partly to  blame for the attacks. More feelings of hopelessness. I thought about my oldest son in  college, who is in the age group that would be drafted first if it came to that. I thought  about my second son, in his senior year in high school, who would become eligible for  the draft next year. I thought about my draft number, 157, just high enough to keep me  out of the stinking Viet Nam war. I heard President Bush say that this battle could go  on and on for years. Just like Viet Nam. If this goes on that long, I thought, my 12- and 14-year-old sons could become draft eligible before this is over. At that point, almost  two weeks after 9-11, I cried for the first time. I felt sad for the people of New York  when the WTC was destroyed, but I feel dread and horror about another Viet Nam-type conflict  that could be even worse because of continued terrorist reprisals. \"\"I watch the news on TV as soon as I wake up, at 6:30, and before I go to bed. For years prior to this I have only read newspapers for the news.\"The terrorists themselves saw this as a fulfillment of a high calling to preserve their religion and culture. The leaders behind this are motivated by a need for power and a hatred for those who have tried to Westernize the eastern world.\"I have become a news junkie, and started to share my mad theories about 3rd world war, which now can become true. Remember that  I foresaid it!\"\"Because they value most their ideals than their life. If someone doesn\'t respect his own life, who would he  think about other\'s life. Specially if he despises them?\"\"I believe that islamic terrorism acts won\'t stop at that. Radical  islamists*, have a new weapon we have no defence against. We have no means to stop someone who is ready to kill himself to achieve his goal. I always believed that if there was ever gonna be a third world war it would be ironic, because it would really be a war between the 3rd  and the 1st world, led by emergent muslim nations. Their military power is  far behind that of the western world, but they have devised a cheap and  deadly weapon. And they really want to expand their territory, they have  already started in Serbia and former URSS republics. And this is  unstoppable, because it\'s not a decision of some islamic government, it\'s their people\'s will. At the start of the imminent conflict, most muslim  governments that are supporting US, would find themselves in a state of  near civil war, and if they cease their support to the US and give some economic or military support to Afghanistan, for example, to stop  the onset of a civil war US would fight them mercilessly. So they are in  a  cul de sac . I really think that a war would rage across the world as a consequence  of the attack on NY. American attitude won\'t help to calm things down. I think you are more hurt in your pride than for the horrible life loss. Watching the news, I sometimes think that you\'d be more angry if the White  House was destroyed instead of the WTC, despite the fact that there would  be much less people killed. Sorry about this, but it\'s the impression you give.   On the other hand, I think Israel would try to make profit of this, and  that can mean their end and another reason for the historical hatred against jews. In any case, I always believed that Sharon would bring war across the middle east one way or the other. In fact, the current crisis is more a result of US support to Israel than a result of its global politics And this war would be different to all we\'ve known before. Islamic nations would use their poor armies to defend themselves against the conventional attacks form the US. As the war gets stuck, US would start to use nuclear weapons, but we might never know this. In Europe and America, war would be different, it would be a terrorism war. Many muslims in our countries would sacrifice themselves for the Jihad, even if they don\'t belong to Al Qaeda or such organizations, just for being heroes and for the promise of going to Heaven. The situation is even worse in Europe, because we have muslim nations that  all around and it will be very easy for the terrorist cells to get into EU, just consider Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia inside Europe, not to say Northern  Africa. In Spain we have a great flood of immigants from Morocco that  come in little boats called  pateras  across the Gibraltar strait.  Apart from smuggling all these illegal immigrants and loads of  cannabis, what else can bring these  pateras ? Russia will also suffer a lot. In fact, it seems they\'ve been  suffering for a long time in Chechnya.  *(in fact, from our point of view, we could consider the  beliefs of every muslim as radical. Their culture is much more  ethnocentric and their concepts of justice and religion are far more  drastic than those of the western culture)  \"Radical Islamism did it. Israel and the US have some  responsability themselves.\"i worry about more attacks. i sleep worse, have more nightmares about living through a war on US soil. i am even more rabid about responding to racist remarks and attributions for guilt that are unfounded and racist. i feel less patriotic (is that possible?) in someways (i cringe to see all these american flags everywhere), but feel more american than i have in a long time (this is how i am perceived by other nationals who don\'t know my critical stance on america). i haven\'t felt this american since i lived overseas... i think twice before drinking water from the tap. and i wait anxiously for the next bit of bad news...\"\"sad to admit, but i think much is attributable to America\'s global economic and political actions and attitudes\"because they see it as an affront to the American system (political and economic) and the ways we live our lives\"i mourn the loss of human lives, i mourn the (false?) sense of security i had in my own country. at the same time, i know that our nation\'s economic and political policies have made us a target for a long time now, and i am not surprised it happened. for a long time, i suspected a conspiracy somewhere within our government, as someway of unifying the very split population and putting them behind a president that many did not have faith in... i still wonder if/where the conspiracy lies... i am very sad this happened, but can\'t help but thinking that we had something this horrendous coming to us... we\'ve not been the models of democracy that we tout ourselves to be; i was hoping this would help illuminate our hypocrisy in many domains, but instead the media and much of the population seems to be even more riled up under the flag, painting us as the land of The Good and The Free, when so many don\'t want to realize that we\'ve been neither good nor free since our nation\'s inception. i deeply fear that this will take over partisan politics, which were already ignoring the needs of a huge percentage of our nations citizens and residents. i mourn the violent repercussions we\'re taking on countless innocent civilians in Afganistan... countless because the repercussions will continue long after we (attempt to?) obliterate who we perceive to be our enemy. i fear the way this has changed geopolitics for the next 20 years, and the future beyond that. i am frightened that this could cause more complications to a world full of racism and classism... these are just a few snapshots from my perspective...\"I haven\'t a clue.

'islamic fundamentalists\"My perspective is certainly different today from September 11. Then I was mainly shocked at the very sight of so many people dying, flying out of the windows etc. From then on I feel more connected to the otehr western countries, espcially to the U.S., which I felt quite distant and estranged from our reality, especially after the refusal to abide to the Kyoto protocol and weak action to solve the Middle East crisis, which is certainly linked to US. acritical support of Israel. Now I feell there is a possibility the US will better understand that they cannot be safe in a world where porvery and unjustice are so widely diffuse, that they cannot sustain a government just because it supplies them with oil, no matter where the money paid for the oil goes. On the otehr hand I feel that Europe can no more consider world terrorism as a problem involving only the US. I feel the western world has the possibility today of solving the problem of terrorism, that everyone may be confident that this event is not going to be forgotten and for this reason may act with calm and confidence of support. I certainly feel afraid that we might have attacks against european cities, but I do not believe the only poinnt is that my immediate neighbourhood is not involved: the point is if we change western attitude towards the rest of the world in the direction of greater responsibility.\"I listen more often to TV and read more newspapers\"the organizers are paranoid.

I think I understand some of the historical rationale they might have, most mostly I think it is a fundamentalist hatred of the sensual world and an envy that turns to insanity.\"\"I work in Soho and was in the subway when the attacks happened.  A young woman on the train said terrorists had attacked us.  What can you think about such Cassandra-like pronouncements?  But there it was and I and my colleages immediately went to the roof of our building to see the whole horrifying spectacle.  So many people have said it seemed like a movie, and it did.  Overwhelming disbelief.  From the beginning, as they sent us home, I felt that I wanted to be down there, running through the smoke.  Did I fantasize about overtaking the perpetrators and crushing them with my bare hands?  No.  The picture that came into my mind was the London Blitz, and what I wanted in my gut was to be immersed -- baptized, my childhood elders might have said -- in what was likely to be the most tragic occasion I would ever witness.  Part of this is that I am passionate about New York; part of it is a result of my generation\'s odd sort of guilt at being spared the deprivations of our parents and of war.  As the day passed and my friends and I phoned around and ascertained that everyone in our circle was safe, I felt -- I think we all did -- a kind of aching numbness.  I won\'t say I felt cheated by being spared a direct hit on a loved one, but I felt I wanted to grieve more deeply and actively than I was capable of.  And still I wanted to be a part of it, not just as history but as a hit on our city.  Funny, too, how many New Yorkers think of the attack as a hit on the city more than as a hit on the country, even given the attack on the Pentagon.  This is an emotional thing, not an intellectual one.  There is probably not one person in Oklahoma City who shook their fist after the Murrah Building bombing and said,  They can\'t do this to Oklahoma City!   But I think we took this personally. I know that if I were not in New York when this happened, I would not be able to stand it, I would need to be here.  To this day I feel bereft that I was not able to stand on the pile and do something for somebody.\"no change\"I heard the news from a collegue at 4 pm (10 am New York time). My first reaction was one of disbelief, followed by a feeling of anxiety about what else was to follow. I was not able to continue working, so I went home and watched various tv channels (mainly CNN) from 5 to 7 pm. By then the situation had become clear, and my feelings had changed to anger about such a senseless act of violence against innocent and unsuspecting people. I tried to figure out against whom my anger should be directed, and quickly became convinced that this was an act of war against democracy and freedom, committed by zealous muslim terrorists, probably backed by anti-American governements like Irak and Afghanistan. This anger and thoughts about how to find and punish those responsible continue until this day. During the rest of the day (Sept. 11) and the following day I listened to the radio, read newspaper reports and watched tv with very mixed feelings, varying from grief, sorrow and disbelief to anger and revenge.\"\"I can find no positive arguments whatsoever, only negative destructive ones like hate and intolerance\"\"probably zealous muslims, blinded by an unmeasurable intolerance of other points of view and hatred against western societies\"Don\'t know\"Not much, other than as described above\"Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda\"My first response, upon hearing of the attacks, was  who are these cowardly rat bastards? . As the atrocity unfolded, and it is an atrocity, I was somewhat numb and unbelieving. Then as the enormity of the events became more and more clear, I became angry, but resolute, in that I cannot believe that this country,as should many countries,will let this dastardly, nay, Hitler-like deed go unpunished. Rather than a like response, once responsibility is known beyond a reasonable doubt, then crush them. Women and children did not conceive, plan and execute this. Were I younger, I would immediately volunteer. I retired from US  military service after almost 28 years.\"Osama bin Laden and his organization.\"That night I was horrified by the terrorist attack. As I reflected more, however, I was horrified at our lack of preparation for such an event, by our lack of good intelligence, and by not understanding the mindset of the terrorists, the Arab/Muslim world, and the jealousy of other nations. I now think that any military action has to have very definite aims, a strategy for using force, and an anticipation of reprisals. I could write lots more, but the bottom line is that the wounds will heal -- but the underlying situation will not, unless it is thought through and addressed.

'\"On the 11th, I was shocked, horrified and alarmed.  The event awakened the grief of the recent death of my mother.  I also had, and still have, a premonition that there a number of additional \'sleeper\' agents planted throughout the world who would be willing to continue this carnage and that their fanatical dedication would be difficult to eradicate. Today I recognize that this attack has ignited an endless series of tit-for-tat retaliatory raids that will last of decades.  To some degree we will have been drawn in to a middle east situation that will last for years.  I suspect that it will take at least 5000 military/investigative personnel to eliminate each terrorist.

Will the people who planned and executed the deeds of Sept. 11 wish they had not?  In the end, I think they will. I\'m smart enough to know I\'m studpid, that is, I don\'t understand the rationale, be it personal, political, religious or nationalistic, that drives someone to mastermind the fall of the World Trade Center buildings.  I can imagine the terrorists saying to themselves,  We\'ll attack the World Trade Center (and some other places) and then the Americans will _______.   The probelm is, those people had the hubris to fill in the blank.  Many a would-be hero has been brought down by his own arrogance.\"A hateful person.I\'m sadder.Dont know\"The WTC and Pentagon attack was shocking, particularly when I heard about it happening when the rocket attack was occuring in Kabul. With the initial information indicating simultaneous trouble at such distant places it seemed like a global conflict had started. Maybe it will lead to global conflict, but I praise the US for waiting and considering its response, rather than a knee-jerk PR strike. I think its important not to attack civilians in Afghanistan or other countries in an attempt to get \'justice\' for the victims of this attack. I think the world has changed since the attacks, many attitudes and expectations are now different. If the follow-on conflict creates more hatred against the US and the west, then the terrorists will have won no matter what happens to any specific terrorist group. Lets be carefull what seeds are sown. The 6000+ victims are an enormous loss. I wish their families and friends may bear the grief and achieve some peace and acceptance of their loss. I think the media has devoted far too much air-time replaying the images of the impact and endless side issues in the first couple of days.

I respect all of the fireman and police offices that immedatiley tried to help those that were trapped in the buildings, and for all those who lost their lives trying to help others keep thiers. I also respect all of the stars of america that have made donations for the families that have suffered by these attacks, and I think that shows the unity that America has when it is needed, and it is reasurring that we can come together when we are in a time of need. Looking back on this it is an amazing time, and I continue to hope that our country stays united until we find the people who are responsible for this horrific act of violence.  \"\"Whenever I hear a airplane it makes me remember the event, and I try and feel for those that were killed in the attacks. \"\"Usama Bin Laden, and his followers.\"\"Personally feel that the United States has done something wrong, and they are punishing us.\"They haven\'t (yet).\"One man\'s freedom fighter is another man\'s terrorist.  Assuming that Osama bin Laden is indeed the  perpetrator then his zealotry (in his mind)is entirely  appropriate. Was the AMerican Revolution an act of  terrorism resulting in the overthrow of a legitimate  government or was it a bunch of people liberating  themselves from oppressive colonisers? I imagine whoever did this (have you ruled out  American Nationalists?)believed they had a legitimate  grievance against the USA. It was clearly too well planned to be a random act of violence. My personal belief is that terrorism is wrong  and should not be tolerated ever. BUT when is it terrorism, when is it freedom fighting?\"\"I heard the news on my local radio station on the morning show. The announcers patter is always intended to make you laugh. So when they first announced the attack, I thought it was a joke ad waited for a punch-line that never came. My wife and I boht leapt out of bed to turn the TV on where we saw the plane crash into the second tower. It was astonishing almost unbelievable. It seemd unreal. Once I arrived at my workplace, most of my workmates sat down and watched more coverage of what had happened. As far as I am aware I knew no-one in New York. The first few times I saw the crash and people waving from the windows I felt shocked, dismayed, upset, stunned, sadness, empathy, pain. However after a day or two, I just feel sadness and sorrow for the people who lost loved ones. Although this seems crass, my concern is for my wife and I because of the financial impact on world  markets. My mortgage will go up, things will cost more, our standard of living will drop. I live in New Zealand and am a New Zealander. When the big players on the world stage fight, its  the little guys who become the victims of  friendly fire  or are listed as collateral damage. \"I don\'t know. But it was wrong.

'\"A shocking event which will lead to fundamental changes in our foreign policy, internal security, and military preparedness and action. A traditional military response will be ineffective and will play into the hands of the terrorists. The only way to defeat them completely is if *all* nations recognize the danger they pose to the world and cooperate in their elimination in their own self-interest. Leaders of Islam in particular will have to step forward and continue to condem these acts in the name of their religion. My contern is that the terrorists may to  top  this event with something even more spectacular, e.g., a nuclear attack. \"Leaning toward bin Laden.\"Fundamentally, a hatred toward America.\"\"More depressed, obviously, and concerned about what will happen in the future.\"\"I am an arab-american student and was born and raised here in states all my life, with everything going on now it definately makes life a lot harder to deal with. I\'m not so much afraid to walk out of my door with my safety in jeopardy, but the safety of my family members- particuarly my sisters and my mom. Being a muslim, it is very common to see a muslim girl wear the traditional head dress, and because wearing a head dress isn\'t exactly a big fashion statement, it\'s easy to point who can be a target for a vicious backlash. I\'m the oldest of all my bothers, and second oldest among all my siblings, and worry everyday if someone will try to induce harm onto the women in my family. Especially my youngest sister, who attends a muslim school, where she is required to wear the traditional head dress everyday. I fear her safety more then I fear for my life because she is petitte, very shy and wouldn\'t be able to defend herself if someone tried to attack her. Even in my household the talk of what happened brings us to a dead silence, wondering if someone wants vengence. The day of the attack, a person who lives across the street from my house came outside his basement apartment and started to post signs saying,  No to PLO  and  Go Home Arabs , he then became boisterous and not before long engaged in a vicious verbal shouting match with my mother who tried to explain that because my family and I are arab-americans does not mean we condone what was done nor any arab american. I admit, had I seen him yelling at my mother the way she told me he was, I don\'t think I would have tried to resolve it by talking to him, but by other means. Luckily since the incident I have not seen him, and have had the backing of my neigbhors who have lived in my neighborhoood for as long as my family has. {right now, i have stopped typing about the incident, and am looking at my hand, I can see it trembling, and now find it hard to type anymore.} I reallize I have not finished what I wanted to say, but I will end it very soon. The reason being is I just want it all to stop but know it never will. I\'m trapped in a world where my birth will decide my fate. Being an arab-american wasn\'t my choice, is was my birth right.

My mother woke us up with a phone call at 6:15am our time on the 11th saying that two planes had hit the WTC.  We immediately watched the rest of the day\'s events live on TV, the bulletins coming in about the Pentagon and the other plane crash in PA.  We saw first the south tower and then the north tower collapse.  It was shocking to see live because the tv commentators did not seem to know it was happening, there was no narrator or voice saying it was happening, they were talking about something else.  So my wife and I were in shock at what we thought we saw and in horror as enough dust blew away to confirm that one tower was missing, then the horror of seeing the second one collapse.  My wife was physically sick, we were both holding each other and sobbing.  I remember having to drive somewhere that morning and being angry at the people here who didn\'t seem to care, out playing golf, nothing closed, as if hey it is just New York not  us.  We were in shock pretty much the rest of the day.  We kept waiting, worried that more things were going to happen.  When the buildings came down we were sobbing knowing how many people had just died.  Living there we knew that about 50000 people worked in those buildings.  Phones were out so we used email to frantically see how our colleagues and friends back home were doing, thank god they were all accounted for though there were two close calls.  One colleague had just landed at JFK from California an hour before the attack and said he had had a great view of the WTC while flying over it.  Just 2 hours later both towers were gone.  Our view out our apt was of Wall street; it is going to be so strange to look at that view when we get back to New York.  We wished we had been there and had not been far away, unable to help or be with friends and support other New Yorkers.  \"\"Watching more News TV (almost nonstop during working days - I have TV in office for monitoring local news as part of my job as municipal  public information officer )  Arriving earlier at airport for air travle that has continued despite events and threats every weekend since 9/11 attack for side business and family gathering  Reaching out more to Afganni woman in our office, discssing Afgani politics and history and social patterns of people there and Afganis in USA.

The justice in question should be mediated by the United Nations. Finally, the U.S. should put restrictions on the civil liberties of non-U.S. citizens staying in the country temporarily; we need measures that would allow the government to much more closely monitor their activities while they are in the U.S. This solution would bring into fruitful union humankind\'s oft-expressed  love-your-enemey  ethic (see http://service-net.org/ws/theme145.cfm) and good old American pragmatism. It also recognizes, implicitly, that we as a nation must accept much of the blame for what happened on September 11, 2001. Our terrorism and aviation security experts have been warning us for years that this tragedy was waiting to happen. Our leaders rejected the experts\' recommendations because the measures to prevent last Tuesday\'s events would have meant spending more money and imposing some inconveniences on the traveling public.   Religious fanaticism such as that driving the terrorists of last Tuesday should be considered a severe form of mental illness, and, thus, a destructive force of nature.

THE BIN LADEN VIDEOTAPES I have come across several references to some videotapes that are supposedly passed around among arabs in the middle-east produced by Bin Laden expressing his views and attempting to gain support among people of the arab-speaking world.  At the bottom of this message are some links to webpages describing tapes that are released by Bin Laden.  Most appear to talk about a nine-minute tape released in June of this year, but one page ( http://www.rense.com/general11/vid.htm ) talks about a 100 minute tape--however the dateline of this story is 21Jun, the same date of the other stories about a nine minute tape.  Even so,  I have formed the impression that there might be a number of these tapes that are passed around. To what degree, if any, does the religion of Islam--right or wrong--play a role in the motivation of these terrorists?  Many muslims are saying that these terrorists are not true muslims, but the terrorists themselves seem to feel that they are. Whoever it is that did this, they still have not released an explanation, or list of demands, or anything.  What do they want?  What are their goals? What do they have planned next?  Do they really commit these attacks on the west because, as our leaders are saying lately,  they hate our way of life ? No matter how much I hated another country\'s way of life, I cannot imagine that I could ever convince myself that hijacking airliners and killing 7,000 civilians would accomplish anything other than making the world a worse place.  It seems to me there must be more specific reasons than  they hate our way of life  or  they hate liberty  or any of these other obviously inadequate explanations that are being parroted by so many talking heads these days.  If we understood how they think, we might be able to predict what their next target is.  The better we understand them, the more likely we will defeat them.

Back in the early Seventies, I seem to remember sitting in long lines for gas, and people yelling at each other, people trying to break the lines and bumpers tapping,  waiting an hour and getting turned away because the pumps ran dry... Oil is the LIFEBLOOD of modern Industrial civilization.  All these people who bitch about the Evil American Imperialism in the middle east act like our CIA did the bad shit for fun, like OPEC never, in a not-too-subtle way, once tried to wag the dog.  Maybe they brought some of that  oppressive foreign policy  shit down on their own heads, huh? Hollywood or no, Higgin\'s speech at the end of  3 Days of the Condor  has a certain brass truth to it.  Don\'t bother asking Joe Blow what he thinks U.S. Foreign Policy should be in the Middle East now.  Ask him when he\'s cold \'cause there\'s no heating oil, and there\'s no food at the store because the trucks can\'t run.  He won\'t want you to ask him.  He\'ll just want you to *get it* for him. So what\'s the solution, O Birkenstock Gurus?  Horse and buggy?  Hell, I\'m with ya, I\'m a romantic.  Seen the movie  Tombstone  about 70 times.  That\'s *just* my game.   I\'d love to go back to riding horses. THE CIA AND THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CRUSADES   Bin Laden calls Muslims to arms     Tuesday, September 25, 2001 at 09:30 JST     Osama bin Laden urged Muslims to fight  the new Jewish Crusader   campaign     We are firm on the road of jihad (holy war),  the multimillionaire   Islamic militant was quoted as saying by Qatar\'s al-Jareeza   television.    The new Jewish Crusader campaign is led by the biggest crusader Bush   under the banner of the cross,  I told ya so.  On 13September I said,  I am beginning to think that what the terrorists of 11Sep REALLY wanted was to bring back the Crusades, to bring back the war of Christianity against Islam.  All you Explainers and Terrorist Sympathizers think that the poor third worlders would just join hands with us in brotherhood and love if the darn CIA wasn\'t fucking everything up with evil U.S. Foreign Policy.  Although there is some truth to that, you don\'t acknowledge the truth that many of those third-worlders would happily do away with America if they could, and they would not lose a night\'s sleep over it.  They would be happy to eat our lunch, and some of them do design our death. You think Conspicuous Consumerism is bad?  Shit, every thirdworlder on this planet would give his left NUT to own an SUV and eat Big Macs all day long and the rainforest be damned!  I\'m not saying it\'s right, but let\'s not elevate these people to some level of Rousseauian nobility that they *just don\'t have*.  I think the movie  Baraka  is an important and exquisite statement of what it is to be human, but even so, I still lock my fucking doors at night... Conservatives and Right-wingers and the CIA and Big Business are the biggest monsters you can conceive of.  You think the most awful thing in the world is some rich white guy wielding foreign policy in the CIA, the State Department or the boardroom of some Multinational Corporation.  The worst thing you can imagine is America, abusing it\'s power and brutalizing your poor, innocent comrades in rice paddies and rainforests around the world, who would be grooving with you at a Phish concert if only the Secret Corporate Government would stop rigging the game with torture and mind control. I too saw things this way, once upon a time.  I used to let God and School and Parents think for me.  When I realized what a chump I was being, I became outraged and so then I let Pink Floyd and Abbie Hoffman and Jello Biafra and Noam Chomsky et. al. think for me.  But I came to recognize that it was the same puppet show with different puppets. When he saw the  QUESTION AUTHORITY  bumpersticker, Robert Anton Wilson\'s reply was,  SAYS WHO?!   At this point, I wanted R.A. Wilson to think for me, but he turned the job down.  So finally, I am stuck with ME thinking for me.  It sucks, and it\'s a shit job, but *somebody\'s* gotta do it. I\'ve got some bad news for you, sunshine.  There ARE other monsters in the world, ones we don\'t own and operate, and these are the guys responsible for some (or maybe most) of the torture, brutality and injustice around the world that upsets you so much.   But what about The School of the Americas! , you say.  You think the U.S. Army can turn an ordinary person into a torturer?  The South Americans who went to that school had to already have that disposition if you ask me.  We Americans are certainly guilty of making these monsters worse, but I do not believe that we alone solely created all of them in the first place.  But if they were predisposed to that kind of sociopathy, it is only because of the horrific conditions created by American Neo-Colonial Exploitation and Oppression of the social environment they grew up in!  Killers who grew up in poverty aren\'t the guilty ones, the guilt belongs on the heads of rulers of Big Business, it\'s not the fault of the killers, they were disadvantaged by a horrific environment as children blah blah blah blah.   Sorry, no sale. I believe in personal responsibility.  If I do you wrong, I  expect you to hold ME responsible, not my childhood environment, neighborhood, parenting, or anything else.  These theories that people are not responsible for their own actions are utter bullshit.  Let\'s all disavow personal responsibility and then we can do anything we want!  Gimme that car!  I want your woman, you gotta die  BLAM   BLAM !  Hey sorry judge!  It was MY ENVIRONMENT THAT DID IT, NOT ME!!!  Riiiight.   Only a lad, you really can\'t blame him, only a lad, society made him...  ah, oingo boingo... love those crazy tunes! If you truly believe America is the font from which all of the evil in the world flows, I can only look at you and shake my head and hope that you don\'t just shut your eyes and stop learning.  It would be nice if the world was that simple a place, but it\'s not. Are the CIA a bunch of monsters?  Certainly.  That\'s what we pay them for. They do a job that you bleeding-hearts don\'t have the stomach for.  They do a lot of terrible shit, and a lot of it is certainly wrong and done for big business.  I never said I thought Chomsky was wrong, I said he irritates me, because while he has a million complaints, he doesn\'t seem to have *one* real answer on how things SHOULD be run, and neither do the rest of you fuckin whining Explainer/Sympathizers.  Of all the Explainer/Sympathizers who are trying to blame the Media, or the Intelligence Community or U.S. Foreign Policy or the Repulicans, Conservatives, Limbaugh/Buchanan, Falwell/Robertson--Ogres all--I have not heard ONE bit of constructive advice from any Explainer/Sympathizer.  They want to armchair quarterback the most powerful country in the world, and they don\'t even have the balls to say how THEY would run the show if they could.  I will now quote Sgt. Barnes, the villian from the movie  Platoon :  There\'s the way things ought to be and there\'s the way things are.  World War II is over, and WE won. NOT somebody else.  AMERICA. If the world doesn\'t like the way we run things, maybe they should have fucking FOUGHT HARDER. (Incidentally, I don\'t mean to ignore our friends and allies the Brits in this, nor our other NATO allies who also fought and sacrificed and also won. I am only trying to answer a body of critics who appear to hate America.) This is not a Dr. Seuss world and it never will be.  Now Bin Laden is trying to revive the crusades among the radical fundamentalists of the Muslim world.  Again, I\'m not an expert, but I\'ve read a little bit about the crusades, and you Sympathizer/Explainers had better hope to God that the Muslims don\'t start THAT shit back up again.  And yes, I know the Christians started it last time. You worry that we are too much monsters.  I pray that we are monsters enough. You call me Hitler, a racist, a terrible person.  You think I don\'t care, but believe it or not, those words go right to the bone.  I know *exactly* what awful thing I am promoting here.  I\'ll wager that I know it better than you.  And I do have a conscience despite what you think, and I am not stupid, regardless of what you would like to believe.  So you might try to broaden your world view to account for me, so that you can continue to play a role in my thinking and the thinking of others like me, because we are not going to just let YOU run the show.  At some point, we will begin to play a role.  The cheap insults don\'t sway us to your way of thinking, so you\'d better come up with something else. Or just keep ignoring us as ineffectual, and leave us to our own devices, and see what the future brings. -- rotflmao7d1  Show me a young conservative and I will show you a man with no heart.

'Osama Bin Laden\"I believe that we as a nation have created tremendous resentment within a subset of the Muslim community.  This, in my opinion, is because of our policies towards Israel and because of our perceived  colonialism  through business and influence in the Middle East.   We now are reaping the consequences of these percieved wrongs.   In my opinion, we should hunt down and kill those responsible, but we should also ask ourselves what is more important to us as a nation, access to cheap petroleum fuel, the security of Israel and the Middle East, or the security of our own cities. Because of our open borders there are many among us that would harm the U.S. and undermine the freedoms that we hold dear.  Purging those from our communities will test us, and tear at the fabric of our liberty.  We must rise to this but in doing so we must not forget that as Americans, it is personal liberty and equality that make us great.  We cannot lose this in the quest for greater security. We also need to understand that brute force alone cannot defeat this type of enemy.  It can solve part of the problem, but as long as there are young men who believe, rightly or wrongly, that the weapons and funding that contributed to their displacement, or the deaths of their families and friends were supplied by the U.S., we will have this problem. What do we care about most? Oil? Peace in the Middle East and the security of Israel? Peace in our own cities? If it weren\'t for oil the Middle East would be another Balkans. \"Resentment towards the U.S. for its policies towards Israel and perceived colonial behavior that is an afront to the fundamentals of IslamI am more aware of my surroundings and suspicious of those who look Middle Eastern.I am less likely to fly anywhere. But that has more to do with airport delays than it does fear of terrorism.\"I am stunned and unable to grasp the magnitude and implications of what happened. Every question seems to lead to more questions about who, why, how . . . I think the bottom line is that we do notknow enough to effectively understand all this or put it in pespective. I think  war on terrorism ,  cowardice ,  evil  and the like are being bandied about as though they effectively summarize the nature of the events and the correct responses. This is oversimplification that will lead to the deaths of many more people. Will a war on terrorism become something futile like the war on drugs?\"I do not know. This is the toughest question I have pondered in the last few days. There is simply not enough information available to form a reasonable theory.\"I do not know. There is simply not enough information available yet, maybe ever.\"\"I am of course deeply horrified by the events of September 11.  That destruction and violence of this magnitude still exist in the world profoundly saddens me.  While I am now a California resident, I lived in New York City for seven years and even worked in the WTC as a temp for a few weeks.  Although I thought of those buildings at times as obnoxious symbols of our imperialistic capitalist tendencies, I also remember dancing on the Pier at Gay Pride events, looking up at the towers and feeling proud to be an American, proud to live in New York City.   In the wake of the crash, many of my friends breathed in smoke, suffered through the catastrophe.   While I do not in any way advocate the notion that America  got what we deserved , in thinking about the attacks I have tried to understand the reasoning behind the people who perpetrated these violent acts.  Of course, it could be argued that these fundamentalist anti-American terrorists are beyond reason.  But I think that the reason why Bin Laden was successful in organizing these attacks can be partly attributed to the fact that anti-American sentiments have been brewing and developing for years in Afghanistan, largely due to our irresponsible foreign policies.  To much of the rest of the world, we as Americans appear as a fat, rich, wasteful, spiritually-dead, greedy, loud people who talk rudely on cell phones in public places and drive our SUVs to work with only one passenger.  I think that many other countries in the world view us negatively because our leaders have not always represented us in a sympathetic light: for example, Bush\'s withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol can be seen as an example of the US\'s blatant disrespect for our position in the world community. That said, I am very proud to be an American.  I am proud of our land, and many of our values.  I am proud of our notions of freedom, justice, equality: although I do not think we live up to these ideals very often.  Our history is full of terrorism: from the slaughtering and terrorizing of American Indians by the early European settlers, including some of our founding fathers, to slavery, to the social inequities that exist in any American city today, you can see that ours in not a perfect, sometimes not even a compassionate, society.   However, I think that as a country, we have proven ourselves to be a strong, united people.  We are resiliant and innovative and creative bunch, we Americans.  Our history includes many developments and accomplishments in technology, the arts, sciences, and humanities that I feel blessed to benefit from.  I hate to see these aspects of our lives being threatened because of a few mad men.  I think that the Taliban is a terrible, evil regime that should be dismantled.  I think that terrorism in all forms is wrong, and that is why I have been glad to see our government acting with some restraint in our handling of this situation.   But I think that some of the lust for retaliation that I have seen among my fellow Americans is as evil as that which our government purports to fight.  Violence and terrorism are wrong, no matter who perpetuates it.  I am glad that our government is doing it\'s best to defend our country during this time, but I am also praying that in our actions overseas, we proceed with caution and respect for civilian life.  \"Human Beings.  I am more aware of my mortality.  \"Jealousy, Anger, Frustration, Insanity\"\"I was horrified by this.  I did not think something like this would ever happen in this world.  When I watched the news, I thought that I was watching a movie.  I did not think it was real.  I thought that soon I would see the newscasters say it was all a joke.  I was terrified that I had someone there that I would never see again.  \"Revenge.  HatredI am scared of planesTerrorists.  Bin LadenThere is no reason to anyone do this.\"I became more sensitive about life. I started thinking more about my family and friends. I also think everybody got closer, like one race.\"I think it was a group of terrorists from one of the Middle East countries.\"I was really shocked with what happened in NY and Washington. I think all the world felt the pain of this attack because it\'s not a matter of borders, like the people that did this think, but a matter of humanity. We are all one in a planet. The same specie but born in different areas. Borders are just symbolic and political and that\'s all! Most of the countries around the world couldn\'t believe in what happened. It was something we had only seen in movies and would never imagine in real life.  I also think that nowadays TV makes things very normal and we see things as if they were not real, like a video game. What I want to say is that many people don\'t have the idea of how big and agressive it really was, specially if you live in NY. That is how you really have a sense of what happened. I was and I still am very shocked. That is how we see how fragile our lifes are and how many crazy people there are around the world. I was very emotional and couldn\'t stop thinking about it for days. It was an attack agains life and freedom. I think we will never forget what happened. I might not be able to express with the right words because of the language barrier, but I think you can understand me.\"',3,-5,0,2,5,1.39,4.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.77,0,6.23,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.39,0,1.39,0,0,0.69,0,2.77,0,1.39,5.54,0,0,0,1.39,0,0,0.69,0,30.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.77,0,38.81,4.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.54,0,0,0,0,0,12.47,8.32,3.47,0,0,0,8.31,0,0,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,2.77,Male49b

I couldn\'t really believe that this was happening.  On top of that, I live in Chicago, so I was somewhat frightened of an attack here (though in my mind I knew there would be no government targets here).  Most of the day was shock and occasional blasts of realization and pain.  I managed to get a hold of everyone that I know in Manhattan, so I was somewhat relieved, although the magnitude of the tragedy was not lessened.   Now I am scared, but not of more terrorist attacks (at least not immediately).  I am afraid of the reaction of our country.  People go between expressing disbelief that anyone could do this to expressing the desire to return the favor on Afghanistan, which is basically hypocritical.  I fear for Arab-Americans and their civil liberties.  I feel, to no small extent, that the face of racism in this country is being disguised as patriotism.  I am not filled with hate and anger, as people around me are, but rather I am filled with sorrow, shock (still), fear, and frustration.  In my opinion, the people responsible for these attacks must be found and tried, but I do not believe that people capable of this type of action are found only in Islam or only outside the United States.  I think about the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of the second world war.  Americans cheered that and the death toll was much higher.  People claim that that was during a war, but the bombs were not dropped on military targets, they were dropped on civilians.  I believe that people, as a nation, tend to forget or rationalize their horrific actions while never letting go of those perpetrated upon them.  And with those mentalities, fueled by ignorance and malice, we have no hope of peace or justice.  I am frightened and trying to find hope within people that I know.  I am sure there is more for me to say, but I can\'t think of it now.  \"\"  When I first was the attack on The World Trade Center on CNN, before I realized the scope of the damage, I thought it was just a re-broadcast of the 1993 bombing.       I think that was the brain telling me subconsciously that it was and unreal event. I simply could not conceive of an act so horrible, and such a broad spectrum of damage.     For the first week I still simply  refused to accept  the damage,carnage, and death. How could the World Trade Centers, a symbol of America\'s strength, financial prosperity and freedom be  gone.  And what of about 6500 fellow country men and women?    After all I am an American, and I had been to the Twin Towers visitor center twice in 1993. Not that the Pentagon deaths didnt strike home for me too. After all I am in the US Army and that is MY supreme headquarters. I have also been there twice.\"The literal belief that they would somehow be rewarded by a supreme being (God) for killing thousands of  innocent peopleTerrorists from the Middle East\"   More partriotic, closer identity with all citizens of the country\"noneTotal helplessness.

All you have to do is accept the free gift of grace and you will be saved from eternal seperation from God.hard heart -deceived about purpose\"I think that what happened on September 11 was truly devastating.  It is unfortunate  that people feel they are going to please their god by killing Americans.  It is a  shame that so many people had to lose their lives but I think a lot of good has come  out of it and I think that God was glorified through the event. As I was processing the whole thing I couldn\'t help but think about what made the  attackers hijack the planes.  I was reminded of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus in the  Bible.  It says that God hardened Pharaoh\'s heart.  What happened?  Israel was delivered out of slavery and worshipped Yahweh (God).  God wants us to worship Him.  It is what brings him the most glory.  As a result of the attacks on America, many people have  put their faith in Jesus Christ and in all reality become worshipers of God.  I think that everything happens for a reason and it isn\'t always an earthly reason.  God was bringing glory to Himself.  Unfortunately it took something like this to get people to turn to  Him. \"',3,-5,0,2,5,0,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,2.77,1.85,1.85,0,0,11.1,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.55,3.7,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,12.94,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,4.62,0,62.87,1.85,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,77.66,3.7,0,1.85,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,22.19,14.79,11.09,0,0,0,7.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,3.7,Male49b

'\"The attacks on the innocent people in the different buildings on September 11, 2001 were acts of religious zealots that have been brainwashed into thinking that these acts will make them martyrs.  In actuallity, they are nothing more than misguided fanatics that are murders of innocent men, women, and children. From what I understand, nowhere in the Islamic religion is type of murderous act condoned or promoted.  The leaders of these fanatics can be likened unto Jim Jones, who in the name of religion, killed American officials and then convinced some 900 people to kill themselves.Then there was the  Outer Space  madman in California who also had his followers kill themselves.In addition, we are now hearing that this type of religious fanaticism is being taught to  school chidren at early ages, thereby insuring more generations of zealots. The unique thing about this attack is that it might have done more for world peace than anyone could have imagined. The majority of all countries in the world have formed a coalition to fight terrorism and if the coalition stays together, eventually these people will have nowhere to go. This is probably the first time in history that this many countries have joined together in a common goal, and I hope and pray that it is the dawn of a new ara of unparalled peace on earth. \"Brainwashed to believe that God/Allah will bless them.NoneReligious fanatics more than likely loyal to Osama bin Laden.the attack on the usa was done by a cowerd on they have not taken  any of our freedom because freedom is in our heartswho do you thinkmore aware of whats going ondumb assThe same reason we are bombing mud hut and caves.Foreign policyNone at all except maybe a little nicer to foreigners.I do not think it would have happened if the US had made at least six small changes in its foreign policy since the Gulf War.  1) The US should have taken all US troops out of Saudi Arabia as soon as Iraq surrendered. 2) The US should have demanded that all Jewish settlers leave the West bank. 3) Allowed free trade with Iraq after the surrender. 4) Secured a homeland for the Kurds and.  5) Cleared Afghanistan of mines and provided a sort of Marshall Plan for that country. 6) Pressure Russia over more autonomy for Chyechnya (sp?). \"first it was disbelief, this is not happening, then it was wow almost exciting, i know that sounds sick, but it was a bit of an adrenalin kick , then after about an hour i thought fucking hell this is serious shit, then when i saw the people jumping out the windows i thought \'what would i do\' jump or fry, i would jump i told myself, then i thought of the families of those trapped and as a father i really was sad, i said a prayer later that night and was feeling angry, hit them and hit them hard i thought - the ones that did this and where they came from, but in reflexion i thought that the afgans are a people with very little, drought, poverty, war fear...should we add to that, so i hope that the mass people do not get hurt by any US reaction as i then thought of the afgan kids and how they might be fatherless as the new york victims  families are and i symathise with all, no one wins everyone looses and now i am sad for all , one thing though wich annoyed me is the americans saying god bless america...fuck that god bless everyone, if the american big boy of the world was a bit more sensitive to fellow mankind then this could might have been avoided and now they are sending war ships \"because america with their policies help cause poverty in certain countriesterrorists from the middle east and USA for being unsensitive about the middle eastern peopleno changemoney- dehumanizationGlobalizationpromote understanding in transcultural setting\"This a reaction of imposing transcultural thought.

'\"Any kind of terrorism is an unjustified act against humanity.  A response to terrorism have to act against the responsibles and protect populations against new attacks.  But, any response to terrorism that causes damages to innocents is also an unjustified act against humanity. Such a response also have to act on the international politics and socio-economic conditions that influence the individuals recourse to terrorism. \"0It is probably considered as a response to other facts and situations to which some responsibility is attributed to western countries and mainly to USA.I don\'t know with absolut certaintyI bought ammo..

'\"I watch, listen to and read international news so much more.\"Terrorists - I can\'t say where the chain of history throught the centuries really points the finger\"I was sitting at my desk at work around lunchtime in London.  I work in an open plan office, and way down the office I heard a co-worker say a plane had crashed into the Twin Towers.   For some reason, perhaps not wanting to think of anything bigger, I assumed it was a light aircraft, like a traffic news plane.  However, news began to spread across the office, to the point where I began to feel like it was some stupid, tasteless \'rumour\' story.  Around 4.00pm, somebody said the Pentagon had collapsed.  I decided to run home and find out the truth from my tv.  I recall walking across the park to where I live, watching commercial aircraft approaching London\'s airports.  I couldn\'t shake the feeling that they were all flying too low. Televisual images of horrors across the world have, I fear, numbed me to the realities they depict.  Only the previous week I had watched with detachment the images of little kids and their parents being threatened by jeering crowds as they tried to get to school in Belfast.  Watching the terrified reactions of children as a pipe bomb exploded close by left me frowning, a little troubled but resigned to the ongoing troubles in Northern Ireland.  Yet, watching the scenes of devastation in New York and Washington, watching the recordings of the second plane impacting the tower, and then the buildings collapse, I found my single thought was the people.  People in the planes, the buildings, and the street below.  I was watching recordings of people dying.  This has stayed with me days since. I\'ve travelled by plane so many times, internationaly and domestically in the US.  I\'ve worked in tall buildings.  I sit now in a fairly tall building, my computer, my telephone, the typical bits and pieces of office life.  I can look out the window across other buildings to London\'s \'sky-scrapers\', Canary Wharf.  I\'ve thought about the moments for people before the horrors began. But, in the end, it\'s too much to imagine, to dwell upon.  So I and many of my friends and colleagues get on with our lives.  I\'m an actor by profession.  On the evening of Tuesday 11th, I attended a first screening of a short film in which I appear.  I sat in a movie theatre with other viewers.  I drank wine at the reception afterwards.  I discussed business with people.  My point is that life just went on, however tainted or shaken by that days events in the US. On tv I watched the parents of a British man who had died on one of the planes.  He and his parents come from my home town.  He went to the same school as my brother-in-law.  His parents spoke and I imagined my own parents, similar in age, talking in much the same way.  The man\'s mother, though deeply shocked, said something that has stayed with me and has given me hope.  She said that there is a \'good guy\' up there who is watching.  Good will win out. On that Tuesday I needed to speak to my friends in the US.  Friends in Minneapolis.  Friends in Santa Barbara.  Nowhere near the East Coast.  I still needed to hear their voices, to tell them I knew.   I don\'t want war.  I know terrorism, whatever it\'s face, achieves only pain, suffering, loss of life.  I feel jaded and cynical about international politics, the hypocracy of every country\'s domestic and international policies.  I feel small, tiny, insignificant.  I want to see people as just that, wherever they come from, whatever their cultural, ethnic or economic background.  I think September 11 has left me feeling defeated, by governments, factions, racists, scape-goaters.  By people. I want the \'good guy\' to be watching.\"\"A pure, all-encompassing belief, faith, that they are right, and what they believe is right\"To punish the USA for past sins committed against Muslim fundamentalists.  Also to disrupt the economic and political systems.\"Today, I woke up feeling less sad than on previous days, but as the day has worn on,  I find myself distracted, listless and unable to concentrate.  I am a Ph.D candidate writing my dissertation in art history, and I feel that it is a very trivial field right now.  Art, however is not and knowing that helps me cope. I am afraid that the USA will be thrust into a war with an unknown enemy in hostile lands - much like Vietnam.  All the stupid technological warfare that has been debated over the last few decades will be useless for this type of conflict.  I want to be able to put my faith and trust in our leaders,  but our president doesn\'t seem to me to be much of a leader.  His advisors are and that might be our saving grace.  I was suspicious of him and his cronies during the election, and that hasn\'t left me.   I would like to spend more time thinking and reflecting.  This being the  Jewish New year is a good time to do that, but unfortunately, the kids  have to be shuttled to school and to their activities, and I have to teach my class in a little while.  Life has to go on whether I\'m ready or not. I was glued to the TV for a few days, but was relieved when normal programming came back on.  I think the media coverage has been great. I find myself most compelled to watch the rescue efforts and the human stories rather than the investigative aspects.  \"\"I have rushed home to catch up on the TV coverage. My wife  and I have felt more clingy, yet at the same time I\'ve  had less patience with my children, for whom I am so afraid. \"Osama bin Laden and the Iraqi government.\"I view the events from a Biblical perspective.  In my opinion, they are simply a taste of things to come.  I agree with those who say the attack was a wake-up call from God because we have turned away from Him.  I believe we, as a nation, need to repent and follow His Word --or we will see much worse in the days and years to come.   I am not surprised by the attack.  Shocked, yes.  But, this has been coming for a long time.  Even non-believers who have been paying attention to world events should have seen this coming.   To me, the most horrifying image is NOT that of the twin towers collapsing, or even of people jumping to their deaths... disturbing as that was.  The most terrible image -- for me -- is the mental one I have of a planeload of Americans cowering in fear because of a half dozen men armed with box cutters.  What does that say about us?  What does that say about us that our foes could plan such an attack depending on that response from us? I believe the message people should take from the example of the heroes on Flight 93 is that we are each responsible for our own security.  We have the most powerful army on the Earth...the most sophisticated weaponry...yet, a few unarmed mean saved more lives and prevented more destruction on 9-11 than all of our military, law-enforcement, and security personnel combined.  Mindset won the day.  However, the government has done its best over the years to take that mindset away from us and help ensure we are helpless against our enemies, whether terrorists or criminals.  How different 9-11-2001 would have been had each airplane had just one lawfully armed civilian aboard. I believe the government\'s response following the attack has demonstrated that, in spite of all the words about this being a war against all Americans -- where each citizen is a combatant, they still don\'t want or trust the citizenry to take care of itself.  Why declare I\'m a combatant and take away my means of fighting in the next breath?  In my opinion, an armed and trained citizenry is the best deterrence against further terrorist attacks here. \"Because they are evil.Islam\"I\'ve been working out more, gathering more information on chemical / biological warfare, and practicing tactical skills such as shooting, etc. much more.\"Each person who made the decision to follow the instructions of whoever orchestrated these events. My behaviors have not changed.\"Their frame of mind or justification for doing this was cultivated by someone who was able to influence  individuals into thinking this was right or they simply were not sane, healthy people. \"\"I am most surprised at how the terrorsits could be so emotionally void, willing to take out all of the people on the flights, in the buildings, and on the ground. I know terrorism has been going on for years, but I am curious as to what statement terrorists are trying to make by creating such havoc.  I suppose they are brainwashed by some strong willed indiviudals, making these weaker people think they are doing this horrific act in the name of God or Allah. At this point I have a feeling of  what\'s next . This event hasn\'t stopped me from  living my life as I had, but it has confirmed by belief that citizens within the US need to be more aware of their surroundings and take a more active role in knowing who they work with and what others are up to around them. I think many people get caught up in their own lives and don\'t slow down to see what\'s going on around them. I do think that security is important, but witht the latest crackdown on security, we can surely expect to lose freedoms we have taken for granted. In a way, the terorists have accomplished one of their goals, to take away the sense of moving around freely. Too bad many are willing to give that up so that OTHERS can try to make it safe for them instead of taking a more active role themselves to help maintain that sense of freedom we have appreciated for so long. I think we also need to understand what\'s going on globally and ask why other  groups/organizations would want to harm those in the US and other countries.  We have appreciated economic prosperity for so long and though it is not our responsibility to make sure all other less fortunate countries prosper, it couldn\'t hurt to work with various other prosperous countries to help the impoverished countries get on their feet. Jealousy is an ugly thing and I think it\'s easy to persuade those in a bad situation to hate those who are doing so well and are seeming to be  looking away  rather than extending a helping hand. I think it\'s easy for dictators to foster ill feelings towards the US because we are such a strong country. Even if we do help in small ways, it\'s easy to sweep that under the rug when talking to a large audience such as a country. Until many others feel the prosperity avail in life we will continue to have many who want to see the US and other great nations fall. I know this is only one small issue in the face of many, but we need to start somewhere. The fewer peopel that feel as if they have nothing to lose or to live for, the fewer people will be willing to be involved in these crazy acts. I could write about so much more, but unfortunately I am at work and need to do just that. Take care and make a personal difference. We all need to do this. to \"TerroristsI am much more subdued and less carefree.\"When a coworker of mine came into the office to tell me that a plane had flown into the WTC, I laughed and thought he was joking.  We checked the web and saw the fire.  A few minutes later when the second plane crashed into the WTC, I was shocked and could not believe what I was seeing.  I went home immediately to my wife and child.  I was relieved to know that they were both ok and only then did the horror of the situation hit me.  When the second tower collapsed, I was overcome with sorrow.  We cried often over the next few days, sometimes in reaction to a news story and sometimes for no reason at all.  As the days passed, my sorrow lifted and was replaced by grim determination to get on with my life and return to normal as best I can.  It is now more than two weeks since the events, and one can still see the effects in people\'s eyes as one walks around the streets of NYC.\"Someone who misunderstands America and Americans might think that such an act will have long term benefits for their cause.',3,-5,0,2,5,2.28,2.73,0,0,0,0.91,0,0,0,0.91,1.82,0,7.74,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.73,0,0.46,4.1,0.91,0,0,5.01,0,0,0.91,0.91,0,0,0,0,26.41,0,0.91,0,0,0,0.91,0.91,0,32.78,0.91,0,4.1,0,0,0,0,0,1.82,0,0,0.91,0,0,4.55,6.37,2.73,0,0,0,3.64,0,0,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,0.91,0,0.91,Male49b

They represent the start of a complex and intricate plan; they show the strength of the motivation of the people organising and undertaking them; while the loss of life in numerical terms is much lower than more frequent natural disasters, it is more international than any of these.  For many people of the Western world of my generation, it is the closest to war that we have been.  The responses, particularly of the US government, are initially emotional.  There appears little consideration of preventing repetitions through addressing the causes and motivations for the attacks.  Race and religion underly much of the feelings and justifications for the forthcoming retaliation(s) (unlikely to be justice - how many innocents will be killed in the process of  punishing  those involved?).  It should become apparent from the attacks that most people are good and nice most of the time (e.g. New Yorkers talking and relating to strangers in the street).

America is a great country, but it\'s not perfect and never has been.  Righteous anger is one thing, but self-righteousness is another.  We\'re not better than others, just better off.  Forgetting that only provokes the kind of hatred that we saw on Sept. 11.  A little humility please!!! 3. People are people, regardless of what part of the world they or their ancestors came from.

I find it hard to watch TV or have a chat with my family/friends/colleagues without the events invading my mind. It will be a long time before I\'m able to step on a plane. Also, because I\'m a brown person (Indian ancestry) I\'m now afraid to enter the US, fearing attacks because of the color of my skin. I have relatives in Kentucky and Texas and my sister lives in Florida. Under normal circumstances, I would\'ve flown or driven to meet them. Now, I do not know if and when I will enter the US again. My heart goes out to the victims on the planes and in the WTC and Pentagon. I cannot bear to think what their families are going through. At times, I\'m on the verge of breaking into tears. I\'m beginning to think that the tragic events have caused me to become depressed. On the plus side, my eyes have been opened to the suffering of people in other parts of the world (e.g. the Palestinian people). I\'m beginning to believe the attacks represented the agonizing cry of the Arab people for justice and freedom. It was like the sufferers were lashing out at a world that merely looks on without lending a helping hand. The world needs to address injustice all over our planet. We need to help the Arab world towards democracy, human rights, freedom and justice. For now, we cannot defeat terrorism. Terrorism has always existed and will continue to exist in our current world of injustice and inequality. But, we can reduce terrorism or contain it; we can do this by reducing injustice and inequality and consequently reducing hatred.

But, on the other hand, after seeing how Americans, and people around the world, reacted to the tragedy, my faith in people has been renewed.

My brother and his fiancee live in New York so my horror quickly gave way to worry as I tried to contact them and make sure that they were okay.  Once I found out that they were alright, I began to be filled with rage at the attacks especially as I watched the news that evening.  I did not think I would be able to watch the coverage but I found myself unable to turn away.  In the days since, I have tried to gain a better understanding on how people could do something so terrible.  I have been unable to understand how people could say that we got what was coming to us.  I do feel like we are at war and that our nation must stand up to these terrorists.  Everything is kind of back to normal, but not really because I know it is not over.  I know we have to go on with our lives but I can\'t help looking over my shoulder wherever I go.

While we would like to see our country react and heal in a manner reflective of mental health, it doesn\'t appear that such an approach is necessarily conducive to protecting ourselves from this happening in the future.

'they are determined to send a message about the evils of capitalism and the USAI have prayed for our leaders more and have kept more informed of world events.  It makes me cherish the life I have more and it\'s brevity.\"a terrorist group, possibly Osamma bin Laden\"\"The events that unfolded on Tuesday, September llth were truly horrific.  I still can\'t fathom the images on the TV screen as being real images from our very own New York.  I am still not sure the whole magnitude of the situation has sunk in.  I am pround of myself though.  I have not become scared or angry like many people have.  I don\'t hate Arabs.  I am not afraid of Muslims.  I don\'t want to go over to Afganistan and  kill all the towel-heads.   All I want is justice for those responsible.  We should find those responsible and lock them away from humanity.  I don\'t believe in the death penalty.  I believe God will punish them in His perfect time.  I don\'t want to go to war.  We should find the most peaceful solution we can.  I believe that God let this whole event happen to give us a wake up call.  I believe God is in control, and he did let this happen instead of totally stopping it.  But, it is important to understand that God did not cause this to happen.  God does not cause evil.  God gives humans the ability to make choices, both good and evil.  This event is a choice of evil.  But, I believe God has used this event powerfully.  Never before have I seen people draw together so strongly.  The way people banded together to help with financial aid, blood drives, and volunteer service has been awe inspiring.  And the way God has drawn his people into prayer and community has been momentous.  I pray that it wouldn\'t take another event such as this to make people realize that we should be  one nation under God  with all due respect and making Him the senter of our lives.\"Bin Laden and his terriost network\"hatred, jealousy, and fear\"have not really changed\"Well, what happen on September eleventh was truly the worst attack on american ever.  I felt sorry like every other American.  But I didn\'t let the terrible attack get the best of me.  Many life will forever be changed.     \"\"Some have become more prejudice, others freightened for their lives, I have just become more aware of my surroundings\"\"I couldn\'t really say...if taken from a  not keeping up with this  T.V. news  perspective, it could be an international incident or it could be someone here.\"\"What makes a human being?  Well I feel that trust, respect, choice, rights as an individual, caring, compassion, understanding are just some of the aspects as to why life as a human being exists.          When I heard about the news last Thursday that planes were crashed into various important buildings...it was hearsay and that is all I knew at that point.  Soon I began to see people cluttering around televisions and rushing for newspapers all over campus, so I did the same. As soon as I heard about this tragedy I asked why just as many have.  A few of the inquiries that came to mind: Why is this a means to an end?   Why must higher powers always take innocent lives for granted for personal gain?  Why would anyone that decides to terrorize a country be considered a human being?  I could go on but the list is just too long and I don\'t have the time to write it all out.  I am sure that the public does not  need a reason to think about the pain any longer.        I find this world to be quite amazing in how beautiful it is, how unique it is, in what has been created.  That is only part of the good side,  however there also can be a lengthy bad side.  Our world has much misunderstanding and prejudice, we take for granted what we have in how we choose to live our lives, we destroy the earth, we are built on money and power, we have weapons that most cannot even begin to imagine.  What does this tell you  about how this world goes around?  Does this mean that humankind was a cruel joke played on the earth by god? No, of course not but our right to choice (which is not at all  bad do not get me wrong) just makes it so much harder to find the reason and meaning behind life.  We will never really find out why we are on this planet and that is why I feel there is a good and a bad.        The bad in life has been witnessed by all last week when thousands of INNOCENT lives were taken in an act of terrorism.  The good came along when we did not let this tragedy bring us down, we only came closer together and helped each other out.  Yet again there is another bad side, why not fight fire with fire and   declare war on terrorism  as the president says and risk more innocent lives.  The good side again is that we are a strong country and we will make it through this, yet  the bad side to that is that fighting in some way or another is the only way to settle the tension of a hostile country or group whichever.  It just goes to show that  with the good always comes the bad...we were a mighty country with a mighty army that kept peace on our native soil, but then international terrorism on a large scale  came through the barrier in a fit of rage, but we came together and pulled through this faster than our enemies thought we would.  The next decision could be war that may end in peace or it may not.  Lives will end and suffer and countries could end in ruin.  This is where I choose to stop talking about the incident because it makes me sick!        What is the point of all this?  Why is this a means to an end?  Must more innocent lives end in order to declare peace?  This is the problem, right here, in the  beginning of this paragraph....too many questions, not even close to enough answers. I cannot go on with my perspective as the pain is all too consuming. One last thing though:      -It is in our nature to kill ourselves, and we certainly live off of instinct.     \"\"Why is the question, and in reference to my previous perspective, I have no idea why\"Al QuaedaMy behaviors have not really changed.\"September 11th began like any other Tuesday morning; the sun came up, I was headed to class, but something was different. I first heard about the planes hitting the WTC towers on my way to my first class, then in the middle of that class we were informed that classes would be cancelled for the rest of the day. We had a campus meeting afterwards, and I had more than a few people cry on my shoulder. I was one of the people least affected by this attack, as I did not lose anyone I knew in the attack. I was also one of the people who had been saying for years that it was just a metter of time before the U.S. was hit by someone. I just had no idea that when the attack came it would be anything as big as the events of Sept. 11th. My initial reaction was one of intense fury that anyone would dare stoop to such levels to kill my fellow citizens. I wanted the people responsible hunted down and punished. Looks like I got my wish. I support the actions our president has taken thus far, but my heart goes out to the Afghani people who, through no fault of their own have been thrust between a rock and a hard place. If they try to leave the Taliban will shoot them. If they stay, American bombs will be exploding all around them. In the end I guess I feel like war on terrorists is a good thing, especially after the events of Sept. 11th, and I feel a sense of satisfaction that we are tracking down and smoking out the perpetrators of this attack. \"To instill terror and disrupt everyday life.to feel that they are strong in there countryI feel very bad about what happened. I believe these cowards should be caught and be put into jail. Some people feel that they should be killed and sometimes I feel the same way too but there are other ways to solve these problems. I feel bad about the families that were involved in this AND IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THROUGH THIS. Everyone should unite together so that we can have peace and can get through everything that is going on in the whole United States of America. The U.S. should take actions real fast and have more tighter security in the airports and all parts of the country. The day these terrorists attacks occured I thought of my father who works in Wall Street and near the World Trade Center. But I called him and he was alright and I was so happy to hear from him.  Not only was New York attacked but so was the Washington area in the Pentagon. Another plane was crashed into the Pentagon at the same time other lives were being destroyed.  I really do not know how these people got into these planes with the knives as they said that they had so easily without nobody noticing that they had these weapons. This was terrible and many inocent lives were taken away. My last opinion about all this would be to arrest the criminals and make them face the death penalty.  there are many that are involved I believeI have been afraid a little',3,-4,0,2,5,0,3.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.96,0,4.14,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,1.18,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,4.73,0.59,0,1.18,2.37,1.18,0,0,4.73,0,0,0,0.59,0,0,0.59,0,23.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,30.15,2.37,0,2.37,0,0,0,0,0,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,10.64,7.09,0,0,0,0,4.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,1.18,Male49b

I am surprised Americans were so confident about their security. They burn both - Israeli and American flags so it makes sense for them to do it to both countries.  Even though power wise we are much sronger - individually they (whoever they are) are much stronger and more determined than we are. As Bin Laden said -  We want to die and you want to live . That was a very good point. Therefore, the war against them will be more difficult and longer than most people hope or expect. \"000\"     Not much, other than my mood.\"     There is no way to know.     They are sick.  It requires a mental sickness to commit an act like this.  No sane person would fly a plane into a building.  They are diseased with blind love for a leader and the blind belief in a religion.  They are what Hoffer called  The True Believer .\"Like most people who  witnessed  this tragedy I\'m feeling a mixture of emotions.  I find it disturbing and frightnening that something like this could happen on American soil.  I think someone in the American intelligence community made an enormous error.  I\'m angry with the people who committed this act.  I think there is a sickness required in order to do something like this.  Above all I feel sadness for the victims.  Every other feeling I have seems trivial when I think about what they must have gone through.  In the list of victims there was a  two year old girl and a four year old girl.  I can\'t imagine what it would require of a person to be on a plane with a child and do what these terrorists did.  That is the question that I have not heard one person ask though.  What does it take to push a person to commit this act?  When someone commits an act of violence we tend to have a knee jerk reaction.  It usually involves feelings of hatred and a desire for an equally terrible response (unfortunately that was my initial reaction).  We don\'t look at the person who commits the act and say,  it must be terrible to feel that way .  In order to deal with an act like this we say  an eye for an eye .  This won\'t solve any problems.  It will only create new ones.      The problem is that with my feelings of pity for the people who killed so many, comes a feeling of guilt.  How can we ever rationalize any positive feelings towards these people when their actions caused so many to suffer?  How can we morally deal with these people without disrespecting the memory of the dead?  That is my conflict and the reason for my confusion since September 11.  When I argue against vengence, those who argue for it reframe what I am saying.  They will say that I\'m  protecting the criminal .  It\'s hard to be sure that I\'m not.  I\'m a very empathic person.  And as I said, every other feeling I have seems trivial when compared to what the victims went through.  Thus, my attempts to come to a rational solution are burdened by my emotions and empathy for the victims.        Right now my feelings about what happened are just beginning to give way to anxiety about what\'s to come.  I do not have faith that the leaders of this nation and those of our allies are prepared to handle this situation.  The United States has performed so poorly in the Middle East.  I don\'t see us turning things around any time soon.  We are living in a very confusing point in human history.  The anxiety of the times is making very hard for people to act rationally.  Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.  After recent events, it is hard to feel optimistic.\"',3,-5,0,2,5,0,6.76,0,0,0,0,0,2.25,0,0,0,0,18.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.76,4.5,0,2.25,4.5,0,0,4.5,9.02,0,0,0,4.5,0,0,1.13,0,47.29,0,6.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,63.05,6.76,0,9,0,2.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.26,15.76,0,0,0,0,2.25,0,2.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Male49b
'To make a statement and feel accomplishment in a situation in which nothing more could be taken.\"All arabs who oppose the US and partially, American polotics.

I fear the possibility of over-reaction as well as the possibility of being to political.  I think politics is very much the reason why we are in this mess.  I feel that military efforts to secure the United States is appropriate until this is resolved.  (ex. military posts in airports etc.)  Very well thought out plans should not be foiled by a weaker foe, even though that foe\'s homeland could potentially even the playing field.  I certainly hope the military is training appropriately.

World debt and poverty.Unable to work or concentrate. Increased television viewing.Because they feel angry and powerless and determined to change the world.\"I first heard about a plane crashing into the WTC from my girlfriend, who rang me. She sounded a little shaky, so I felt that some catastrophe had occurred. Immediately I turned on the TV and stunned at the pictures. I could not work or do anything except watch the news reports. I flicked between channels. I felt immobilised, but curious as to how a thing like this could happen...wanting more facts. Imagining what it was like for a plane to enter such a structure. Then it became like a game, as it became known that an aircraft had crashed into the pentagon. Then a report of another in the air...Would the US shoot it down?  Initial reports here in the UK said that only 6 people had been killed (apart from the plane), so I felt very little sadness. Then the buldings collapsed, and I felt a real dread that something awful was going to happen. I feared that my shares would be affected, and started to get angry that I hadn\'t withdrawn my money from the stock market. Several counterfactuals started to play out in my mind. My girlfriend and I were calling each other every now and then to say  Did you you here about... . We were assimilating facts to make sense of it all. But I must have seen the second plane crash about 150 times, and became saturated with the story. At one level I became addicted (coming from a TV news background)to the story and the images. At another I felt I had experienced enough of the story and wanted to hear other things. But I could not work several days. I never really felt upset for the people that died, but I could see that others were upset, and felt that I  should  be feeling upset too. My attention was turned to the lame responses of Bush, and the media frenzy that followed. I became disgusted at the amount of right-wing attitudes that were turning up. The racism disgusted me and all the talk of revenge and retribution annoyed me and made me feel powerless to stop the insanity. It was so dissapointing to see world leaders thinking in such irresponsible warmongering ways that just provided a good reason why people resort to terrorism in the first place. Demonising the third world, and not trying to understand the causes of such actions is the wrong way of going about this. I began to feel afraid that a big war would be started for no good reason, and no good outcome will come out of this. I feel sorry for Afghanistan, and fear that there will be more misunderstanding in the world and hatred against Muslims. Where is Bush\'s Christianity? What is this talk of the  free world , of  civilized world . These tropes of freedom and civilization are disguided forms of racism. What about the terrorism inflicted by the US, by the UK? Harbouring terrorists???? What about the US supporting the IRA? What about the CIA killing people? What about all the bullying that the US does in the world? Do Americans appreciate this? Can they appreciate it? Isn\'t that also terrorism!? The hypocrasy was making me sick. I had to remind myself that what we are witnessing was a media event and not the event itself. Highly stylised and packaged to sell to a common market. But the stupidity of it all is frustrating. So I have also been mad at the biased reporting and the lack of caution and the stupid things that people say. I have been yelling at the TV. When will it end? However, I was pleased to see Bush give a press conference at a mosque ... that was hopeful. And the UK media have been including the views of pacifists and academics which has tempered the storm somewhat. Interestingly most of the focus has been on the WTC, and not on the crahes at the Pentagon or Camp David. I suspect that the TV images have fuelled the enormous emotional focus on the WTC, as that is were the dramatic pictures are. I wonder how the world would have reacted if there were no TV pictures of the actual explosion and collapse. Peace, forgiveness and understanding.\"It has made me closer to God which is our only rescue and salvation.\"I see horror through my tears-filled eyes. I despise all evil and I despise the individual who have done this. These individuals do not care about innocents lives or even life itself. They\'ve entered into the hearts of the terrorists so that you will not know who is the true enemy. The terrorists who opened these wounds, killing and maiming our brothers and sisters, parents and grandparents, struck each of us, if not in body, then in conscience. Not since Pearl Harbor has this nation been so severely injured by enemy aggression. And never again will anyone of our generation feel a sense of security at home, at work, or in our travels. \"because they are sickno sureI think that the men who did this felt great pride in their faith and heritage and saw the U.S. as a threat to that  culture. I think they were threatened enough to commit these acts.\"A great number of people. Everyone thinks it\'s bin Laden. I don\'t know if that is necessarily true, however I do think he inspired the acts of the men who committed this horrendous crime.\"\"The attack was the most tragic event that I think any of us will ever see. The fact that drives this home for me is that we lost more people during that day, in peacetime, than any other day in U.S. history, war or peace! All of the people touched by this is really hurtful to me, however, I think that a greater union, among Americans, as well as among all people who denounce the attacks, will result.\"\"As we all do, I watch the news more than before, but more importantly, I will never look at the American flag in the same way. I think my generation has taken for granted the rights and freedoms we share and, I hope, these events will eradicate that feeling. A great many people, young and old, grew up on 11 Sept. \"\"I live in Toronto, On. Canada. I am still experiencing alot of anxiety and continue to feel down. I know this is attributed to the attacks. What worries me is that I make attempt to meditated almost daily which helps releive some of the stress, however I know so many people who have attempted push the incident aside and pretend like everything is alright. This worries me because I know that the fear and sadness that remains will need to find an escape. I hope these individuals find a productive release and not let the despair lead to violence. We are at a communal loss and are experiencing shared despair. We can let this incident bring us together and strengthen our resolve against violence and create a future of peace or let it destroy all that we as civilized people have worked so hard to create and maintain. Like a knife in the terrorists pie we may begin to divide and separate indiviuals, communities, religions, cultures, and countries. Another worry,  Christian Fundamental beliefs. Like extremist fundamentalists I see christian fundamentalism in America and Canada as serving to fuel the fire of fear and terror. I worry that there will be many more Wacco\'s to come in the near future. Not only that but as people begin to look for meaning they may be open to fundamentalist beleifs that provide simple answers for a complex world. These Christian Fundamentalist - some of whom have links to the Bush Govn\'t may rise in power and status -  especially as the war machine gears up for the slaughter and attempts to turn the American economy which is on its way down, around. Although people are saying there is so much uncertainty, I beleive things are clear. America\'s oligarchy is being threatened, and they are not going to go down without a fight. American mass culture will be so misinformed that they will blindly follow whatever meassures are taken to  protect freedom . This will not happen right away but will be incremental. There will not be calls for peace on a grand scale, only calls for revenge shadowed as  justice . I appreciate this forum for discussion. I hope many people visit it so that they can work some of this stuff out and have some release before it is too late.   \"We all are. Anger has a source.

Just because people are poor, or extremely angry doesn\'t cancel out their intelligence. What they did demonstrates a lucid understanding of how to operate domestically against this country.  Maybe we are dealing with some diabolical mind ala James Bond. Who knows, point is we the people don\'t. Perhaps someone in the intelligence world has a better picture. However, John and Jane Q. Public will make up their minds in the information vacuum and build their opinion based on the bullshit floating around on the airwaves. I really dislike T.V.\"\"I have not fully processed the events of last week, as I doubt many have. I was in the process of getting wrung out from the flu when the sh-t hit the fan. So last week while everyone talked about the import of what happened and watched news and thought, I was barely able to think, lying around with a fever and a horrible cough. I don\'t think, however, that I will miss any opportunities to discuss what is going on. Since I am not (to my knowledge) intimately involved with the death it is perhaps easier for me to step back and wonder about how this nation will react in the months to come. In fact I feel removed from the anger and fear, as the fallout from this act has barely rippled the fabric of my community here in Montana in any tangible way. Sure, there is discussion but life largely goes on undisturbed. Unlike what my parents in Seattle see and hear, with missle frigates in Puget Sound and figher planes messing up everyone\'s sleep, screaming about the night sky.  What I do fear, however, is that our  leadership  will take a more bombastic (and bombing) approach to dealing with the Nation\'s turmoil than I would like. While I do not deny people\'s desire (and perhaps my own, though not well developed) for a tangible revenge, I truly hope that any use of force is thoroughly thought out. All this call for blood and for  relaxing  our view on  collateral damage  scares me. It\'s  patriot talk  for wanting the American people to allow the occasional indiscriminant killing of innocent bystanders to be done in our name. We know the bad guy is in room 17c so lets blow up the whole building and call it good. The hawks point the finger and shout that Bin Laden doesn\'t care about killing the innocent and if we don\'t adopt his manners then we will never be able to effectively combat him and his followers. May be. However, if we follow his path will we be vigilant enough to be able to discern, down the road, the difference between  us  and  them . At what point will our use of those tactics blend with their use? What will make us more right? Won\'t our rhetoric and their rhetoric mirror each other? It already does in some ways.  I worry that fundamental introspection will not occur. That an in depth look at the reasons why people are so angry with America won\'t take place. More Americans need to think about why so many dislike our political state, our economic might. We have potentially huge paradigmatic shifts ahead of us - how we face them will tell a lot about the character of our nation.  Pain, rage, horror, deep sadness, fear, exhilaration, bonding - all potent catalysts. Maybe in our healing we can look at other wounds and societal illnesses that have been swept under the carpet of our national conscience. We would be fools to think that our own Nation\'s ills do not reverberate through the global politic and influence the way our country is viewed and treated by other nationalities.  \"\"Define responsible. Hard question. Various intellectual and emotional leaders from various regions around the world have guided various people to commit horrible acts. Vague yes, but pointing only to one man seems tragically myopic - as if killing Bin Laden or Hussein will end the trouble. It could be said that the predominant economic paradigm of resource consumption and  free  market capitalism played a role, helping to keep a vast majority of the world\'s population in a state of deprivation. A group of people who are hungry, poor, and live daily with the fear that some state organization will bust down their door and bust open their head is a prime petri dish for breeding minds that feel disenfranchised in total. What have they got to lose by stapping semtex to their bodies? \"\"It has reinforced my dislike for television. I couldn\'t believe my eyes when Fox broadcast a  simulation  of the attacks on the planes - showing people stabbing people with box knives. We don\'t know what happened. They are creating visual representations out of thin air. Of course people respond to such visions viscerally.

'\"Stocked up a bit on food, water, and ammunition.  I\'m not a survivalist and really don\'t think these supplies will be necessary, but, as the attacks have made clear, you never know.\"\"1)This was not a declaration of  war  against  freedom  or  liberty  or any of the other buzzwords the media and the politicians have force-fed into the country\'s collective consciousness.  Sadly, most Americans are incapable of distinguishing between democracy (a system of government) and capitalism (a system of economics).  Whereas democracy (or a sham-system of representative democracy, in our case) dictates how the infrastructures of our country operate, capitalism determines how our country operates within the greater context of the world.  Colonization and imperialism are perpetuated by the need to expand markets and to obtain resources...to maximize profits.  14 year-olds in the Asian Pacifics work in slave-labor conditions not because of our democracy, but because of our economic system.  Middle Eastern culture and tradition is being deteriorated and mocked not because of our democracy, but because of our crass consumerism.  The attack was not a symbolic attack against  freedom  or  democracy.   They would have attacked the Statue of Liberty or the White House, if that were the case.  This was a practical, direct attack against the world hub of capitalism and the military complex which supports it. 2) Bin Laden may or may not have been behind the attacks.  The media have been quick to finger him as the prime suspect and have been quick to remind the public that he may have been behind past attacks, but have not once mentioned that he was a product of the United States\' foreign policy.  During the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, the CIA trained Bin Laden in terror tactics to be used against Russia.  He was able to drive Russia out, thereby solidifying Afghanistan\'s loyalty to him.  Not once since the attack have I seen an explanation of why Bin Laden remains a  guest  of Afghanistan and why they are not willing to turn him over.  It was the United States\' military presence in India (or Saudi Arabia, I can\'t remember) during the Gulf  War  that turned Bin Laden against the U.S.  Bin Laden served our terroristic pruposes in the past...and it was our economic greed which ultimately turned him against us. 3) Whether it be the CIA-sponsored coup in Chile, the U.S.-trained death squads in Nicaragua (where 30,000 people died as a result of our influence), the estimated 1.5 million Iraqis who have died as a result of the U.S.-led UN sanctions, or any number of other examples, the United States has used terrorism to its advantage time and time again.  It is now time, sadly, that we must reap what we have sown.  Our patirotism is misguided.  Our concern is hollow.  Our indignance is trained.  And our greed and anger are deadly.  Our complacency has been our greatest luxury, and now we will pay for it with our own blood.\"The United StatesSee comments on Page 1not much. Its just sad that someone has so much anger inside himself. I wish I could understand the reason behind this anger for the good of mankind.\"Severe anger due to somethings they completely disagree with. Like I mentioned, could this be due to gross inequality in power and wealth. This does not necessarily mean that I support their disagreement.\"\"It is a horrible act and hope to never see it happen again. But while Taliban is getting most of the blame, Taliban is in fact the byproduct of marriage between CIA and ISI.  So, even if we can eliminate Bin Laden and fanatic organizations like Taliban, how can we ensure that such things will not crop up again.  As many newspapers suggested, is the core of all this behind gross disparity in wealth and power between the haves and have nots around the world.  American must use its power to dwell into this aspect as well.\"\"Well, they have Arab features and thus must be somethings associated with Middle East\"Anger of being treated unfairly \"1.

Next time I go up to NY, there won\'t be the WTC\'s (I was suppose to go up to NY that weekend!!!!!).  It\'s as if somebody died in my family, although I\'m not seriously emotionally attached to the WTC\'s.  I did not lose any family members in the insident, however my grandfather and uncle use to work for two of the fire depts. in the towers when they collapsed, so they new many people that were lost in the tragedy.  Because of this, my entire extented family was greatly torn.  My whole family was just sad, especially my grandfather.  My immidiate response to the situation was revenge, but now I\'m really proud of the US for what we\'re doing.  It\'s only making us stronger.  I still can\'t believe it happened, but what can you do.

I resist the notion that the WTC is a symbol of the American people (it\'s a symbol of finance and economics, but NOT a symbol of \'our way of life\'. But the belief that it is, is probably why we WERE attacked (as a sign of misplaced priorities). I\'m saddened that I did not receive a single email from friends in Europe over the event, even after developing good friendships with people over there for the past 2 years.

'Osama bin Laden terrorist organization\"I have, at least for now, changed my priorities.  I wanted to go home and hug my wife and child and protect them.  I have a deeper appreciation of the  important things  in life.  Brought back to the realization of my dependence upon God.  My prayer life has changed.\"\"Honestly, I believe that this is a wake up call from God.  We have heard over and over again that this is a war between good and evil which I believe the majority do not realize just how true this is.  The hijackers have been referred to as religious fanatics and their belief was that they were obeying God.  In my opinion, based on my beliefs, they were blinded from the truth.  This nation was founded on Biblical principles and the founding fathers were believers of the God of the Old and New Testaments.  Throughout the years, this nation has turned away from these Biblical principles leading a life of their own moral choosing, contradicting the morals established by the Bible.  God\'s word is to be  a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path  (Psalms 119:105) and this has not been the case for the majority in this country.  God is a good God but He is also a just and jealous God.  God is sovereign and in control as well, meaning He would have to allow this to happen if it were to happen.  Others may say how can you say God is good if He allows this to happen?  My response is He is good but He is not safe.  He  chastens  those He loves so that believers may walk in His ways.  Whenever a child of God strays from His path then He  leaves the 99 and goes after the one who went astray .  The response to the attack has been people praying and churches were full, many in fear but others getting the message that maybe this nation hasn\'t been following after God and obeying His word.  Another thing that does have to be pointed out is that the two targets were the world trade center (money) and the Pentagon (security).  Perhaps these have become the idols replacing the worship of God.  We shouldn\'t get caught up in all the bad without seeing some of the good from this.  Signs that God is still in control and that this could have been worse.  It is amazing that nearly 50,000 people work in the WTCs but yet only about 5,000 are expected missing (granted is terrible for the 5,000 but it could have been 50,000).  We hear a story of a police officer falling 80 stories in the avalanche of steel, concrete,etc and only suffering two broken legs.  Planes that normally seat about 300 were only half or less full.  We hear the heroics of the flight that crashed in PA of the passengers overtaking the hijackers.  This event has made me depend on my faith in God through His son Jesus Christ to help me cope with this tragedy.  His word has been a comfort as well as praying to Him and to know He is a giver of peace.  The answer I believe to this is found in 2 Chronicles 7:14, If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\"\"Blinded by Satan!

Make terrorism an international crime\"At first I could not believe my eyes for what I saw on TV. When I saw the first plan hit, I thought it was an accident, but when I saw the second plan hit I knew it was a planned attack. It took me a day to recove from the shock, as if it were that did not happen. When it sunk in that it did happen, it brought out memories from WWII when we were bombed suddenly and unexpectedly in Florence (Italy) when two bombs feel in front and in the back of our house (500 Florentines died). On another occasion, when I was in the hills overlooking Florence I saw the American bombers drop bombs over Florence again. Now I was filled with sadness and cried about the people who got killed. I immersed myself in work and I could not bring myself to look at the awful pictures of the attack. I still do not want to see them. They are too painful for me.\"We can no longer think and feel that we are invulnerable and imperious to home attacks.I will be flying to NYC on the 27th of October as I was planning to do all along.\"It just seems so unbelievable.

'\"The event that happened on September 11 was very trajic. It left the United States in sadness, and especially in anger. I think out countrey had grown even stronger from this experience.

It was a truely horrible event and a complete tragedy.  I say this up front because it worries me that people will misunderstand the rest of what I have to say, thinking that I condone the attacks on New York and Washington.  That could not be further from the case. After the initial shock wore off, I found myself asking the question,  Why did this happen?   Why do the middle eastern people hate us so badly that they would do such a thing, and that in certain places there was dancing in the streets afterwords?  To say that it is because we are the defenders of freedom, or that it is because they are jealous of our affluence, or that it is because their religion tells them to hate our way of life, is a gross oversimplification and perhaps even completely wrong. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because we funded the Jewish take over of the area formerly known as Palestine (now known as Isreal).  Palestinians had been living there for 2,000 years after the Jews originally left of their own volition.  It was/is an area Muslims consider sacred.  How many Palestinians have died over the last ten years as they fight to keep what is rightfully theirs?  More than the 5,000 Americans that died last week for sure. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because American oil companies took amazing advantage Middle Eastern countries until they wized up, kicked us out and formed OPEC. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because first we created Iraq\'s military to fight Iran, and then later bombed the shit out of that very same military. Why do they hate us so badly?  Maybe it\'s because as comedian George Karlin puts it,  We seem to think it\'s okay to bomb brown people.  One phrase keeps going through my mind,  The chickens have come home to roost.   We trained bin Laden how to be a terrorist to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.  How ironinc he now use those skills against us. We as Americans don\'t know what it\'s like to not be American.  I suspect it sucks to be on the other side of that equation.  I believe it is time for Americans to take a good strong look in the mirror.

The beleif that god is on their side.\"At first I couldn\'t believe what had happened. I had just flown back from visiting a friend in france (1 hour flight), and after collecting my luggage I bought a drink from a shop in the airport, one shop assistant was telling the other about a plane crash that had brought down the twin towers. I thought it was just \'airport talk\', whilst waiting for a connecting bus I heard some other folks chatting about it, and began to realise that something big had happened. My immediate reaction was that of personal mourning, though I couldn\'t explain why, as I have no personal connection to any folks there. Because I was on my own at the time I had nothing to distract me from thinking about it, once on the bus the radio went on and the we all listened to the news. Soon though people began to chat with each other and the news effectively became background music. At the time this frustrated me cause I thought that the least people could do is listen, out of courtesy. But when my family met me at the other end of my bus journey, I became aware that there is nothing that I could do to change what has happened, and listening to the news does not change anything. Thus I just had to move on, carry on as normal and not act any different. It was just so hard to know what to feel at that time. I met with my friend soon after getting home, the first thing she said was \'fucking pakis man, I told you they are fucked up do you believe me now\' she is an Indian girl who has always had a bad opinion of muslims. It just made me realise how hard it is to hold an independent thought about such events, everyone has their own interpretation, and yet all that really exists is rhetoric. I have tried see what postives can be learned, but a neccessary part of this is to empathise with both the attacker and the attacked, and of course it is taboo not to instantly condem everything the \'other side\' did.

I believe it is the United States government\'s responsibility to destroy the network of terrorists responsible for this hideous act of violence. I believe that attempts to deal with the  underlying cause  however well intentioned, are basically a waste of time.

I understand that the United States may not have the absolute best military in the world, but we are far better trained and more numerous than any army a terrorist group could attempt to throw together.  As for the fact that terrorists are attempting to use guerilla-style tactics to defeat our army, they seem to have neglected the fact that the US military has a wide variety of organizations within the Special Operations community that are trained for just such tactics.  Maybe they thought that they could recreate a vietnam-type situation.  Perhaps they didn\'t count on the overwhelming willingness of this country to go to war.\"\"Desperation, pure and simple.

Why must the US plead with them to cooperate with our efforts to apprehend and punish only the truly guilty?

'in a direct manner: religious fanatism  in a more indirect manner: the non-existent international policy of pres. Bush and the militant policy of Sharon in Israel.i use more information programmes on television and on the WWW (CNN and others)0a very perverted way of thinking about god and the international policy. \"1.  Modern technology enables terrorists and dictatorial governmental leaders like no time in prior history.  Hitler and Nazi Germany capitalized on mind-control, radio communications and sophisitcated weaponry to wreak havoc.  Now individuals (McVey/Oklahoma) and small groups (bin Laden,  et al) can cause tremendous trouble for the civilized world. 2.  Wars are won on the offensive.  Terrorists will win as long as they are more offensive in their actions than the civilized world is in  addressing the issues that spawn terrorist acts, including terrorist activities per se and the conditions that enable them to recruit, train, pay, supply and command terrorists. 3.  We are wise to recuit Muslims in Afganistan itself to lead the fight against terrorists holed out there because the country, like south pacific islands in WWII is a warren of defensive caves and crevices that are a night- mare to fight in.  We should elicit support from the civilized world in general and civilized Muslims in the middle east in particular to lead the effort to ferret out, prosecute and shut down terrorists there and  any governments that openly support or shelter them. 4.  In the long run, the United States would be wise to lead the civil ized world in the science and politics of defining, building and  maintaining sustainable communities.  As long as peoples are left to  their own natural self-interests, they will overpopulate, over harvest and over-use their resources and countries and create poverty, unrest, pollution, resentment and other conditions that spawn extremist beliefs, war and terrorism.  The United States has the intellectual, scientific and economic resources to quickly and effectively develop a Department of Sustainable Communities and International Dialogue and Service to  coordinate this mission.  A Department of Home Security (or whatever the new department is called) is a primitive self-protective response to the symptoms of this much deeper threat to civilization, overpopula tion and over-use of the planet. 5.  I have a host of specific ideas about exploring the science of sustainable communities, especially the psychology of sustainable communities and would love to team up with others who would like to  find funding to build an institute to this end. Bill McConochie, Ph.D.  (tstmastrATrio.com)  You can attach my name  to my comments above.\"Terrorists.  Probably bin Laden et al.  But I\'d like the guilt to be decided by a world court.\"The reasons/motives are probably very many.  I have built a test that measures violence-proneness which reveals that many, many factors underlie such behavior, including feelings of academic or career failure, feelings of social rejection, rigid thinking, lack of guilt, unresolved anger, hostile pleasure, unwillingness to help reduce violence, unwillingness to seek personal counseling, access to and skill in using weapons.  Many other factors also are related, such as low trust of adults, willingness to commit crimes, feelings of general ineptness in handling unpleasant emotions, etc., etc. I expect that in terrorism adherence to fundamentalist religious beliefs, poverty or deep concern for poor  people, feelings of hopelessness, low emotional attach ment to other people, feeling unloved personally, etc. will also underlie terrorist leanings.\"\"I\'ve shared with a few collegues my interest in sus- tainable communities and that I and our government should more actively pursue them and lead the world in this effort.  I\'ve also expressed my various opinions with friends about what I think prudent response by our government should be, and gratitude to fate that we were up at the top of the WTC several years ago on vacation and not on the morning of Sept.11 this year.\"It hasn\'t changed basicaly.trying achive something - on an unacceptable way for me\"Probably they are commonplaces, butI think: 1.)I have never been thought it could happend; 2.)The word, the power, the way of the  development , the transition during the process we call globalization, never can be the same; The  we all thogether  has an other meaning 3.)

Personnally, nothing much has changed - though i do keep a close ear to what is happening in the news...\"\"Shocked and dismayed that someone concieved the idea of using innocents to kill civillians.  I felt sick that this happened - how could anyone do such a thing.   I do not believe that the US and the US Government are completly innocent (look at the Hostages in the 1980s in Beirut, and the Iran missile exchanges etc with Oliver North), but it is terrible that so many innocent people were killed.  Why couldn\'t the damage be limited to military targets? Why couldn\'t the people on board the planes be disembarked before the planes were used as missiles?  It was shocking. BUT - i do not thing that we should go to war over it.  I fear that the world will once again witness the use of nuclear weapons.  But this time, instead of politics, war will be based on religion.  Funny - everyone dying for the same God. If Bin Laden is guilty, I doubt that religion is to blame.  Just like Hitler used science to get his \'master race\'  justified , Bin Laden is using the Koran to justify his own from of hell on earth.\"Religious fanaticism and a resentment of the success of Western capitalism. \"Reactions in real time I heard about the events about 40 minutes after they started. I was at work so it was difficult for me to get to a TV or radio, and the news sites were disappearing from the web because of overloading. Once the scale of events was clear, my initial reaction was one of shock and horror. This was followed by fear that more attacks were in progress that we didn\'t know about. I am of the generation that was just old enough to register the seriousness of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and a worry that the violence I was watching in real time would get out of everyone\'s control and lead to monumental blunders on a global scale. (This feeling has not diminished by the way). In the days after the attack the distress and shock gave way to a feeling of depression and dejection, out of sympathy for those caught up in the tragedy. In retrospect Events have left me bewildered and insecure. Bewildered by the lack of preparedness of the intelligence community. This type of attack from rogue elements was overlooked in favour of more technically advanced threats - bio-warfare, suitcase nukes, ballistic missile launches and so on. The simplicity of the approach taken on the 11th that means the type of offensive we were all dreading (and working to avert) in the coming decade is already falling upon us now. Insecure because all Western nations are in the front line of an invisble, undeclared war. Also insecure because the identified enemy is irrational, fanatical and does not respect human life, even their own.   \"I am more tolerant of others in my everyday dealings.

Every time I read more stories about victims in the paper, I cried some more. I was and am surprised by the extent of my reaction--I feel as if somebody in my family dies, even though no one did. Just this weekend I am finally starting to feel that the event is becoming past-tense, rather than a current nightmare--I feel like I have pretty well comprehended the extent of the tragedy, and I am no longer shocked by each new story of a victim or survivor.

You are left desolate wondering how on earth you can help and knowing you are there so you cant. Six months later it is still upsetting when reminders come on to the Television.

I was completely shocked by what happened. It was sort of a combination of shock that anybody would conspire to do such a thing and that they got away with it. I felt kind of numb. I saw an interview with a guy on CNN who said that his heart was heavy and that though he was not in the WTC when the attacks happened, emotionally he was there. That\'s kind of the way I felt, too: I wasn\'t there, but I was there emotionally. I empathized with the fear and pain felt by the victims and their families. I also had a hard time processing my emotions and knowing what to feel. What I mean is that by the end of Tuesday, I had been watching the TV and listening to the radio descirbe the horror in the US all day. I was kind of burnt out. Yet I felt it was a betrayal to those directly affected by the attacks to turn my attention to other things. Especially pleasant things like a  nice  TV program.  Now I feel like the whole world is holding its breath waiting for the  next move. What will the US do and what will be their (our) opponents\'  reactions.  In four weeks I am coming to the US with my husband and young son. I am  terrified of flying in general and now, emotionally, I am pretty  petrified. But rationally I cannot think of a good reason to cancel my trip. I am upset that the attacks have influenced my life in this way. I am upset that I feel afraid for my life.  One of the questions that has been burning in my mind since the attacks is if the perpetrators expected the world to react in this manner. Or are they sitting around saying  Wow. We never counted on this.  Or are they watching their  master plan unfold?\"I feel that the event that took place on September 11th of the terrist attacks was crazy.

'Al-Queida terrorist group led by Osama Bin LadenI try to be nicer to people (strangers as well as family); I am better able to put things into perspective; I feel the need to spend more time with family; I have put vacation plans on hold; I am cautious when opening mail.\"It has been more than 6 weeks since the event, and I am still not able to verbalize how I feel.  Perhaps I still feel  numb .  While I have been keeping up with the news, I try to find articles about those who have perished so that I can gain a more  personal  feeling about the events.  Hearing that thousands of people lost their lives is difficult to comprehend.  However, when I read names and see faces, it becomes a more real and personal tragedy, and I am able to lose some of the numbness I feel.  I guess I am still wrapped up in the  how could this happen /emotional aspect of the event, and I haven\'t really begun to feel the hatred toward the terrorists that others are expressing.  At this time, I am more concerned for the families and friends of the victims.  Yet, as the threat of anthrax and other possible bioterrorism continues, I am also beginning to feel frightened for our country, and I am left wondering how many more families will be affected by future tragic events related to this terrorism.  And I constantly ask myself:  Could I or my family be directly affected next? \"Hatred towards America; extremist belief that their religiion will reward them\"September 11 was truly a shock to me. I woke up to a phone call about it and turned on the TV to see what was going on. The attack really didn\'t affect me personaly, but it scared me quite a bit. Many of my hallmates (in college) were worried that their families might have been in danger and many images came to mind of people jumping out of windows, and of families crushed because a loved one had died. It also bothered me quite a bit to think of the terrorists who had been so evil. How could anyone do such a horrible, horrible thing? Revenge was never anything that came to mind. More, I wanted to know that something like this would never happen again, and that all the families of victims would find some kind of peace among all that happened. I went to multiple prayer services and prayed that the families could indeed do just that. More than anything, this event has taught me to value my life and to be thankful for all that I have, including luck. One of my friends from school was supposed to be in the World Trade Center at the time that it was attacked, but because he frequently slept in and was late to work he was not in it at the time. He must really value his life now. I couldn\'t even image how changed i would be if something like that happened to me.\"I have become much more grateful for my life and a lot more easy going about everything in general.\"They must have some kind of grudge against the US.

I am friendlier to strangers. I cry easily.\" I think about it constantly.  It seems to me that nothing will ever be the same again.  I feel tremendous loss, at a very deep level.  At times I am frightened.  I feel powerless to do anything, yet I feel that I have some responsibility for what has happened.  I was really struck by a quote in the newspaper by an Egyptian shopkeeper who said,  It\'s unfortunate that so many lives were lost, but Americans need to come down out of their tower and recognize how their government\'s policies affect the rest of the world.    When I read that, I realized that I am ignorant about our policies toward the Arab world.  I have not cared about the Arab world.  It seemed very far away, very foreign, and not relevant to me.  To the extent that my attitudes reflect those of other Americans, we have some responsibility for what has happened.  I feel guilty for my role, however small, but I also feel powerless.  What can I do now to help bring peace, to rectify any wrongs we have done?  It feels terrible to know that so many people hate us, that so many people would be glad to see me dead.  It shatters my image of myself as a good person. When I think about what has happened, everything else seems trivial. It is hard to keep going on, doing my job, going about daily activities that have lost their meaning.  My greatest needs are to find some meaning in all of this and some purpose in my life that relates to the new world order.  At the very least, I need to find ways to encourage myself to go on.  More important for me is to find a way that I can contribute to change.  I have thought of connecting with Muslims in my city to learn more about their religion and culture.  I would like to read about Arab history and understand the context of their anger.  I do not know how I can make my professional work relevant to the global issues.  Perhaps the most I can do there is to be a model of tolerance.  Living my life with integrity and love may not change things at a global level, but at least it is a way that I can contribute to peace at a very local level.   \"\"I think this is a very complicated question, for there are many direct and indirect factors.  I am sure than Bin Lauden was involved and I am sure that he is evil.  We must look into his creation and our training of this monster and we must understand Middle Eastern history back to the creation of the Ottoman Empire, the Palestinian problem, the slant drilling which inspired the Gulf War, etc...  Let\'s not search for simple answers but look more carefully at the world today and the solutions needed to bring lasting peace and more univeral prosperity.\"Please see above and original comments.\"It\'s shocking..but almost expected given the bombing a few years back.  It\'s a time for reflection.  Not that we are responsible for this..., but we must change the way we view the world and our expectations for others.  Providing the Taliban money ($43 million) is ridiculous-the fact that we would even acknowledge such an oppressive regime is disgusting.  It just goes to show how much we really value the lives of women and children.  We must stop training terrorists and giving others weapons and tactical knowledge.  It is no longer ok to have the attitude that Roosevelt had regarding Somoza or any other dictator  We know he\'s a bastard, but he\'s our bastard .  This attitude has to go out the window.  We should be helping Afghani citizens get out-we should be setting up stations on the borders and providing food and shelter and a transition to a safe haven.  Adoption agencies should begin to work with Afghani orphans.  We need desperately to change our image in the Middle East NOW.  We also need a military leader who is Arab and Moslem in the US-so as to buffer the frightening division that is occuring as a result of this (which is exactly what Bin Lauden wants).  And as for those who are voting Arabs off of planes........shame on you!  It just goes to show how painfully ignorant we are.  We must broaden our perspective and reject insularity as a way of understanding the world. My prayers are for the families and to heal the fabric of our nation.  This is an opportunity for world healing.  Let\'s not miss the boat.\"I think we\'re all suffering from PTSD to a certain extent.\"I call home whenever I am about to travel during my work day as if keeping a log to enable someone to find me should something happen.  I have been forced from my car to public transportation which has caused physical difficulty for me as well as reducing my sleep as I need to leave earlier in the morning to make it on time.  I find a need for naps when time permits on weekends, sleep is not as restful, as deep, as long.  We are home more. I am shopping more on the internet and less in stores, even delaying some purchases, making some decisions to avoid some places that may be greater targets than other places.  Haven\'t been to a mall or movies for instance.  Display flag and red, white and blue including wearing it somewhere on my clothes or pocketbook each day.  I initially watched news constantly but then found that it was too much and was not only upsetting for my daughter, but I couldn\'t take hearing the same thing over and over, especially couldn\'t take watching the towers collapse every 15 minutes on tv.\"\"Osama Bin Ladin, Taliban, AlQuera\"\"I was on my way to meetings at our main office maybe 10- 12 blocks north of WTC.  Like the stories you keep hearing, I was delayed by extra heavy traffic that day and was near the East Village when I heard the news of the first tower.  I was on one of the roads that became a major route for emergency vehicles to head to the area.  After hearing of the second tower, we (I was with a coworker) decided to get the hell out of Manhattan.  Quickly word was coming that bridges and tunnels were being closed.  My only thoughts were to get out of Manhattan and home to Queens.  As a single parent, my biggest concern was being closer to my daughter.  I am so glad that I drove that day because those on the subways were stuck.  Many of my neighbors talk of having to walk miles uptown and crosstown until they reached Queens and could access public transportation.  My car enabled me to be in control of my destiny that day, not dependant upon public transportation, to be trapped in a stopped train, possibly with limited air, lights and stuffed to the limits.  It took me 3 hours to get out of Manhattan during which time both towers collapsed.  Minute by minute it was as if the unthinkable was becoming more and more unreal, even surreal.  Thankfully I have a good sense of direction, a bunch of maps and got us out using none of the major roadways, bridges or tunnels.  We even picked up another stranded Queens resident who turned out to live less than half a mile from me.  My normal reaction in life is to deal with the crisis at hand.  The emotional stuff comes later.  I was in shock, disbelief.  I realized that many of those in the emergency vehicles that passed me on Second Ave. didn\'t make it and were in the buildings doing their jobs when they collapsed.  From my home I could hear the emergency vehicles as a staging point for them was not too far away and they could be heard as they were moving people out of NYC hospitals into the ones near me to free up space, space that never really got used as there just wasn\'t that many who got out.   Since then the sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop, perhaps its hypervigiliance, no I think it\'s more the sense of having my security shattered, or never knowing what or when something will happen, of not being in control (yes, control is a big issue in general for me).  Everytime I have to go into Manhattan now I find that I keep in touch with home more often even if only to leave a message every time I move.. a just in case so if I don\'t return home you\'ll know where I was and can figure out if I\'m going to make it or not.  I keep wondering if there\'s any other place in America to feel secure again.  Surely there must be a small town somewhere that doesn\'t feel as vulnerable as a political or financial centers of America.  Can I trust our government to keep us safe?  How\'d they screw this up so badly.  Are they being honest about anthrax or just telling us tales? I am exhausted, everyone around me is exhausted, moving at slow motion. Things hurt, I feel old and tired. I haven\'t felt as stressed out as this before except for one time 12 years ago when I was awaiting the birth of a child to adopt and there were no births happening and the list was going no where.  Out of control.. it\'s not up to me, it wasn\'t 12 years ago and once again it isn\'t, except this time I\'m somewhat a sitting duck if someone else decides my time is up.  I keep rationalizing that it is within my power to make intelligient choices and to avoid places of greater risk.  But I can\'t avoid Manhattan although I want to.. my job makes me go there weekly if not more.  Even the whole commute is so much more difficult with the travel restrictions, extra security checks.. everything right now takes more effort and time and it is truly exhausting.  Will it get better, will it go back to anything near what it once was?   The coming together of this country has been incredible and wonderfully supportive.  The same people who protested against the war 30 years ago are now screaming to kill the bastards and wishing they could volunteer!  Everything around has American flags, red white and blue ribbons.  Everyone is wearing something patriotic.  It\'s a message to them that you can\'t knock us down, and a positive message for us.  It\'s been since I as a kid that you could feel so proud of the American Flag and want it everywhere without feeling it\'s a hokey thing to do.  Patriotism is once again a good word.\"\"Lack of acceptance of difference, diffent beliefs, different life styles, jealousy of power and the need to knock off the  king of the hill \"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,3.27,0,0,0,0,0,1.23,0,0,0.82,0,2.86,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.23,0,0,0.41,2.45,1.64,0,0,5.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.04,0,22.89,0,2.45,0,0,0,0,0.82,0,34.34,2.45,0,2.45,0,0.82,0,0.82,0,1.64,0,2.45,0,0,0,8.59,11.45,3.27,0.41,0,0,4.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,0,2.86,Female49bb

Whilst I don\'t believe we should let terrorism put us in to a position of fear, it\'s obviously easier to say that when I don\'t live in the U.S.\"\"You often hear people talk about an event and say they remember perfectly what they were doing when they heard about it. September 11th brought that experience to me. The moment I saw the events that unfolded in the US (delayed because of time differences) is frozen in time and I can remember ridiculously minute and irrelevant details about it. It seemed to me immediately that all sense had gone from the world. I\'ve heard people say they felt like they were watching a movie but I don\'t get that at all. It\'s reality was quite apparent to me. I\'ve grown up amongst terrorism (in London) but never ever could have imagined anything as abhorrent as this series of acts. External to events, in that I\'m not an American, I don\'t reside in the U.S., of course my feelings have no comparison to those directly affected by this attack. Even so, it affected me deeply, I cried, I felt numb to the core. And what really made me sick was the TV coverage of young children rejoicing in the streets of the Middle East at the news of the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans. When you see such hatred bred into young children, you think what future is there for peace? Showing such images polarises people\'s attitudes. When you see such scenes, you feel you don\'t want to know what their troubles are, no matter how deserving of our attention they were. You see hatred and that\'s exactly what it invokes in response. It\'s widely touted that the attack on the U.S. was an attack on all free countries of the world. It may be true that the atack has far reaching consequences for us all but, i nthe end, it is the U.S. alone that is hurting. Whilst the rest of us can share their struggle, we can never in reality share their pain. In an ideal world we\'d want to take action and be reassured that such an event will never occur again. I doubt very much that such we will ever be able to guarantee that.  I have to say I\'m not really happy with what I\'ve written above. It sounds cliched. It doesn\'t adequately convey everything I felt and thought about the event but then I don\'t think words will ever be enough.\"I don\'t think the picture is as simple as we are led to believe. I think there has to be an intricate network of different organisations behind such an elaborate attack.\"They\'d want you to think that they did this out of commitment to their cause, that they were martyrs but it\'s more than about a cause. It\'s about pure hatred, evil and a lack of basic humanity. \"\"Insanity, desire for power\"\"Osama Bin Laden, in conjunction with other terrorists\"\"I still cannot believe it happened. Yesterday a newscaster said it, but it is exactly what I think of it  first we saw the unbelievable(1st plane striking tower), then we watched the unthinkable(2nd plane).  Like millions of other people I watched the second plane hit it live and I watched both towers fall, which was even harder than the actual planes hitting for me. My sister was in the other room when the 2nd tower fell. I said  I think the other tower just fell  she said  noooo.  I said  you\'re probably right, its just very smoky now.  I hope I never have to feel what I felt next when the about 30 seconds later the newscaster came on and said he thought the second tower just fell. Then shortly after that he confirmed the horrendous belief. I also think the public is being lied to now by officials about the death toll. I think it is going to be close and maybe over 10,000. I think that it is ok at this point(the deception) simply because the horror of the event is so horrible and in my opinion almost too much for many to take. The only factor that they may be able to control in order to stop even more mass hysteria is to make it seem it wasn\'t as bad as it could have been.  Personally I think Osama Bin Laden should have been hunted long before this. Yet im not so sure he is the only one that is responsible and not knowing makes me feel even more powerless than ever before. I am also scared for my brother who graduated boot camp 2 weeks ago. he never wanted to join the army but he was encouraged to join because he hadn\'t finished high school. I thought it would be the best thing for him and now I think it may be the worst thing for him.\"\"I have cried alot, skipped a few classes, been somewhat lethargic at times\"Because they love evilThis was defintely the work of the devil.

'\"shock and horror at the attack. fear of what happens next nuclear attack? grief and tears for the people who died -especially those on the planes-what were they feeling ?their absolute agony was more than I coud bear to think about. I watched as it all unfolded that morning, my routine every day is to watch fox news. I picked up the phone and called my mom in Minnesota, she worked for both Reagan and bush in D.C.- I called my husband in Atlanta, I knew he did.nt have a tv but could access on line. I called my sister in california 7 am her time but she had seen it. My sister in tennessee called me, I could hardly talk to her. I sat in a stupor all day and made calls to the churches in my area to see who was having meetings that night because I wanted the comfort of others, reassuring words, to take communion ( I am catholic) comfort in childhood rituals. I have always been deeply patriotic, I have several family members who have served in the armed services, dating back to world war one-my great uncle lost a leg in that one, my father was a police man for 22 years, the people who lost their lives running into the trade center to help others, that DID THEIR JOBS should all be sainted.While I have always supported the constitution as it was written , I now feel we should take a much closer look at who we allow in this country. I also believe that my right as a citizen to bear arms should NEVER be legislated or altered in any way.

If some terrorist can hart America, and America can not defence, what can happen with us here in Hungary. I am affraid of the III. World War. This is not a usual war.

I can think in my future as before, it is not so clear for me.\"\"My behaviors have changed little, but I feel a great sadness.\"Osama bin Laden\"At the time of the initial attack, I was numb.  I was watching the events on television, but they had the same impact on me as all of the other war scenes that are shown on television.  As more time passed, and I heard television and radio announcers growing more emotional and grave in their tone, I began to feel sorrow and helplessness.  For the next several days I had difficulty taking my mind off of the event, and any attempt to forget the occurrance also made me feel guilty.  Overall, I do not have any more anxiety about my own safety.  I recognize this is an infrequent occurrance, and my family and I are in no immenent danger.  I also, do not feel a strong need for revenge against those who commit the act.  It almost scares me how retaliation and patriotism seem to be going hand in hand these days.  I would like those who were directly responsible for such hateful acts to be stopped from being able to commit further harm, but I do not wish extensive bombing on Afganistan or other middle eastern nations.  I hope that we enter into any warfare very thoughtfully. I also want to express that it is wonderful to see everyone around me appriciating the gifts that they have.  I live in a large city where I am accustomed to seeing people become frustrated with waiting in lines, frustrated with delays of trains.  Generally people have seemed frustrated with the daily activities of life.  Following the attack it is clear that people do not have the energy or desire to become frustrated over such minor events. \"\"S/he feels that the society of the United States presents an evil, and that s/he is doing a justice by removing those who perpetuate the evil.\"\"I am more cautious of my surroundings, my conversations, and my opinions. \"Fanatick - I \'ve seen it in my country and I see it now...a person that has been since age one fed with hatered towards certain religion or nation and will then do anything to destroy it.\"Honestly I can say I am not sure anymore, since the news have been changing every day. I believe that Bin Laden has something to do with it but how much noone knows\"\"I went through a lot of emotions that day, denial, anger, sadness. Being a refugee myself and going through these emotions before it made me angry. I didn\'t want to see this happen to this country, the one which gave me a refugee and opportunities that I would never find back home. I am also scared that this is not the end, which again I have vitnesed in my country. As much as I am upset at those individuals and groups who have done this, I do not want to see people be killed here because of their heritage and background. I have already seen that I am very scared that it will happen here too. Throughout the last weeks events I mostly felt sadness and anger, but now I am just scared of what will happen next.\"Stupid petty reasons and the fact that they don\'t know what will happen to them now.When I first heard that the WTC had collapsed I didn\'t really think much of it...I didn\'t know what was going on or the details of the event.  Later I watched the news and learned of the sevarity of it all.  I continued to watch the news intently.  I was in complete horror and shock.  I attended a moment of silence on our University\'s Campus for those who fell victim to this tragedy.  It was heartbreaking.  I can\'t believe how many people lost their lives.  I then became very angry and those who had done this although at the time we didn\'t know who was responsible.  I have great pride in our country and I beleive we will get compensation for what has happened.  People don\'t mess with the United States and get away with it.

'\"My initial feeling was sorrow - deep sorrow - at the loss of so many lives.  Without any thought about it, I broke into crying and I cried deeply for more than an hour as I watched the horror unfolding before my eyes on the television.  Then I felt fear and a sense of threat - what if there were more terrorists still in the skies?  What if they came to my city?  Maybe I should have kept the children home instead of letting them go to school.  What would happen if I were separated from them?  Next, I felt angry that someone could so disregard basic  laws (to me) respecting individuals\' lives, property, and lifestyle - that certain people felt they had the right to take away the sense of security felt by citizens of our country.  My anger was intensified by seeing cheering Palestinian children on the television.  I really felt that I could not understand people who could react to such devastation and horror in this way.  After this, I started to feel numb.  I felt that way for several days.  It was only yesterday that I started to feel more in tune with my surroundings.  Now, I am pondering what is next - could the horror ahead be as bad as what we have already seen?  How can we make sure something like this will never happen again, or can we ever be sure of that?  I certainly feel anger - ire, hatred - at bin Laden.  I couldl squeeze his neck with my hands. (Trust me when I tell you I have never done that to anyone or even seriously contemplated it before.)\"A confederation of international terrorist organizations led by Osama bin Laden.I cancelled a trip I was supposed to take.  I am definitely watching more television than I ever have before!To further their own personal and philosophical agenda.\"Although I have strong feelings about my relationship with a higher power, I am not particularly religious.  I blame this in part on extremist segments of all religions.  I feel like there is a strong encouragement in many religions for followers to see the differences rather than the similarities between people.  I also blame it on human nature and physiology, in that we all have some violent/angry streak, especially when threatened.  I also blame it on the polarizing and dichotomizing language used by various nations\' and groups\' leaders, the same kind in which President Bush is engaging. \"\"My first thoughts when it happened were of my beautiful 17-year-old daughter, who is in her senior year in high school almost 2000 miles away from where I live.  All I wanted to do was to put my arms around her and hold her close to me and reassure her.  What does a person that age think when they see this happening in the world?  Overall, I have felt a deep and at times overwhelming sense of grief and sadness all week, about the world, about humankind in general.\"Feeling threatened.  Uninhibited drive for dominance.\"Slower, sadder, cry at the drop of a hat.  It\'s been a week now since it happened, and this seems to be improving.\"more aware of my surroundings and of people and watch a bit more newsfanatacism0osama ben laden\"I believe what I read in the free press, that an organized network of Islamic terrorists that includes Osama bin Laden is responsible.\"\"I don\'t understand why the individual hijackers would do this. My understanding of why the organization would do this is because it wants to increase its control over the Arab world and perhaps eventually the rest of the world as well. In my mind, their vision of the future is unacceptable in part because it is a totalitarian, inhumane vision that would undo centuries of political, social, and economic development. I am also personally threatened by the idea that women in particular could be forced to give up their freedom.\"\"The attacks of September 11 caused me tremendous shock, great anxiety, grief and sadness. Even though I have a Ph.D. in social psychology and my dissertation was in intergroup relations, my worldview was inadequate to understand why the terrorists attacked as they did. After a great deal of soul-searching, information gathering, and analysis, I have come to understand the world differently. For the first time, I  believe that the US has enemies who will attack us as long as they are able and as long as the world looks to them as it does now. I now believe we must continue to strengthen a global coalition against totalitarian regimes whether they be cultural or religious, and I am tremendously saddened by the military action in Afghanistan yet I will support it until a more effective intervention is realized.  To those who would try to understand the  events  of September 11 through self-examination and without attribution of malicious intent on the part of the hijackers and their organization(s) I would point out that they are the perpetrators, and their targets are the victims, of these attacks. To look inward for an explanation is understandable. Just as a battered woman blames herself for her broken jaw, blaming the US for the terrorists\' actions gives one a sense of control over future events at a time when these attacks have made us feel helpless. The danger of this approach is that it leads away from, even argues against the course of action necessary to disable the terrorist organizations and prevent future attacks.  \"\"I pay more attention to world events, all world events, than I did before.

Indirectly, I think our government needs to share in responsiblity for events leading up to the terrorist attack.\"\"I believe that the terrorism occuring in the United States is a result of our  foreign policy.

I think that if the US government had been listening to the reasonable people with reasonable grievances over the last 50 years, that the amount and depth of destruction of the terrorist attacks wouldn\'t exist today.\"to get back at some one who has done wrongI thought that this tragedy was a bad one and when heaven and hell  were populated in a  a minute God welcomed them with open arms . we need to be able to let God work this oout in His time. tragedy happens daily and God puts us through these times to see if we are following him and what he wants us to do for him. that is what i feel about the time on the 11th .

Having said that, innocent lives are innocent lives, no matter where these innocents live. Innocent people have been killed at the hands of Americans in the Middle East for years. The US support for Israel in bombing places such as Beirut means they have associated themselves with terrorists just like the ones that attacked America this month. Terrorism is terrorism. America says they have to retaliate to the loss of innocent lives, which is absolutely fair enough, and a natural reaction to such an event, however, is the retaliation taken by those in Middle Eastern countries not exactly the same thing?? It is all terrible - there are no words to describe how angry I feel at the loss of any life, whether it be American , Afghani, French - whatever. War is not an answer to this tragedy. Finding and dealing with those responsible for terrorism all over the world should occur, but no innocent women, men and children (of any race) should die in the process.  As Bush has said, this should be a war against terrorism, not a war against Islam, or any other religion. Yes, fanatical Islamics, Muslims, and fanatics of any religion go too far, and people get hurt in the name of religion. They say they are following the word of god to the letter, but god would never deem the loss of life as essential for adhering to his word. However, as I said, this should be a war against terrorism - if this gets into a religious battle, the war will be a long and bloody one. Perhaps millions will be killed if the east and west are to face off in the name of religion.\"\"American has some shocking foreign policies which allow thousands to be killed in Middle Eatsern countries every year (for example, they supported Israel both financially, politically and with materials) for the bombing of Beirut and refugee camps in southern Lebanon where thousands of innocents died. Extreme Isalmic and muslim groups have reacted to these events by hating America and Americans and wanting to see and bring about their downfall.\"\"The people who flew the planes are repsonsible for flying the planes, as for the underlying \'mastermind plan\' an extremist islamic group, such as that headed by Bin Laden seems the most likely suspect. \"',3,-5,0,2,5,0,4.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.72,0,0,0,7.84,3.36,0,0,6.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,40.32,2.24,0,7.84,0,0,0,0,0,3.36,0,0,0,0,0,21.28,0,0,0,0,0,8.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb
'\"Terrorists.  I don\'t think that we would be able to have 100\% clear picture of what really happened (or what exactly caused the event), but nothing justifies death innocent people.\"See question # 6.\"Nothing in my behavior changed.  I\'m just trying to enjoy life as much as I can, because 9-11 showed that nothing lasts forever.\"\"At the time of attack I was close to panic, because my husband was working in the building next to WTC.   I was standing in the traffic trying t get home, and I was crying inside, because I couldn t reach him on his cel phone.  Until he called me from home saying that he is fine I couldn t calm down.  After that I didn t really care that I couldn t get home that day, because all bridges were closed.  I was just happy that nothing happened to him.   The next day when I was driving home and saw smoke instead of Twin-Towers I started crying.  WTC was a symbol of power for me.   They were supposed to last forever.  I just couldn t accept an empty space threr.  I lost sense of realty.  I couldn t believe that something like that could happen.  I didn t feel safe anymore.  Money, career, education or other long-term goals were not important.  I was just scared that something could happen to my loved ones.   After 9-11 sometimes I feel terrified that SOMETHING might happen.  Sometimes I catch myself thinking that the bomb might explode and I would never get out from the train.    I feel that I work in the most dangerous place in the US. \"Very strong beliefs similar to the strength of conviction held by radicals in our country who kill abortion doctors and the KKK.I don\'t sleep well. I haven\'t enjoyed anything.  I am discontent and restless. I am unable to focus my energy (what little I have).  I sleep or try to ALOT.  If it weren\'t for my job I would not leave my home.\"I\'m still sick.  I didn\'t know anyone personally, but tell me that someone destroying thousands of lives doesn\'t mean for it to be personal.  I\'m angry, depressed, incapacitated, and angry again.  The stories are heart wrenching. At first I wanted the universities to shut down, business to stop, and life to pause...but I realized that if I succumbed to those wishes I wouldn\'t know when to get started again.  It is unclear to me how we can ever have closure on this...killing terrorists, bombing camps, bombing cities, recovering the dead, having a death toll, cleaning up the physical debris, healing the wounded? None of these or even all of them would not set right this country.  I was oblivious to the attack.  A staff member came in to the room where I was making copies and said,  The world\'s gone crazy.   I looked at her blankly...this statement did not seem so out of the ordinary.  Then she said,  You haven\'t heard?  and she proceeded to give me the gist of what was going on...wtc hit, 50 planes still in the air, evacuating chicago, and that was about it...but apparently Purdue wasn\'t doing anything differently. Class continued, I ran subjects in my experiments (some who knew, some who didn\'t).  Finally, I get to a computer and start looking at the news sites and discover the horror.  Immediately I begin to IM everyone on my list that is online to fill them in if they had not heard.  And I hoped for survivors.  I wanted to hear all of the stories of survival, the harrowing narrow escape, the prolonged wait for rescuers...and there weren\'t but 5.  Only 5 in the \'rubble\'.  I\'m at once moved and skeptical.  My heart aches constantly, I think I\'ve developed an ulcer, I cry (prior to this I simply did not cry).  I cry when Dan Rather cries on Letterman, I cry when Bush says God Bless America, I cry when I see firemen, and I feel guilty about all of the petty things that occupy my time.  The writing of the dissertation, job application letters, and even my field seem to go a long way to explaining what happened but little to ameliorate the affect, cognitions, and behaviors that are explained.  I\'ve been out with friends three times since the attack, and there was laughter, but it wasn\'t the free laughter of graduate students making statistical jokes, it was the laughter of my grandparents that doesn\'t use your whole heart...that holds something back for the terror, the horror.  I\'ve seen friends that seem to have aged tremendously in the last week.  I keep thinking we\'ll all get some sleep soon. But I don\'t even sleep well, not the exhausted safe slumber with pillow drool, but a restless sleep haunted by bin Laden declaring this a \'holy war\' and by my own recent lack of religiosity.  Everyone keeps saying things have changed and will never again be the same, and I didn\'t want to (don\'t want to) believe this...but it seems this is so.  I have no doubt that life will go on, but it is now sullied with impossibilities.  I don\'t remember ever being afraid, ever wanting someone to sleep with for the safety of their breathing and heart beat, I don\'t remember ever feeling limited or helpless or as though there was nothing I could do.  I know the research I thought perhaps if I bought a plant that I could water and care for I would feel better, but I can\'t bring myself to go to a store just yet.  I had two thoughts one right after another once the horror of how many lives were lost...both selfish and both have caused me guilt since then...the first was that the person I\'m supposed to marry was in that building and we had not yet met and now we never would and I would never be with the love of my life.  The second was if it was my last call and I knew I wasn\'t going to make it out alive who would I call...and I realized I didn\'t have a last call...even though I have a cell phone.  In the whirlwind of emotions these two thoughts haunt me most recurring and causing my stomach to turn and my head to ache and my eyes to tear up yet again.  What are my deepest feelings? I feel cheated, sad, angry, depressed, helpless, afraid, pissed off, somber, and on the verge of tears all the time that I am awake and I\'m certain that I cry in my sleep.  And as everyone else in this country is doing when the feelings are overwhelming...I\'ll close with \'God Bless America\'\"\"The hijackers primarily, likely bin Laden, but I find very little solace in holding someone responsible or making someone pay.\"\"Could be anyone, if I had to say, Bin Laden\"\"Hate in their hearts.  Jealousy possibly, pure insanity, who knows.\"\"I think everyone\'s opinion of the actual attack is very similar, it\'s very sad, terrifying and horrible.  Although this attack has been devastating, it is my hope that some good can come of it.  I know it has caused many people to view life differently, appreciating family and friends and life itself more than anything money can ever buy.  I know it has forced me to reexamine my attitude towards life.  This attack has made me think more about America.  We think of America as the greatest country in the world to live in, and it is quite possible that it is, I know there\'s no where else I\'d rather live.  What is so difficult to understand is how we can unite together as a country over something like this yet every day people in our country are commiting violent crimes against their fellow Americans.  I guess there will always be hate in the world no matter where you are, but I guess my point is how can we come to appreciate and unite for our country when foreign terrorists attack yet each and every day we tear it down internally.  I\'m amazed at lack of morals demonstrated in this country on a daily basis.  Maybe I\'m dreaming but it is my hope that there will be many changed Americans over this ordeal, that we will once again be proud of ourselves not only as a whole but as individuals as well and that we will demonstrate this with our actions.   I think I\'ve written more of a speech than anything, but hopefully this will help with your study, good luck and god bless.\"More appreciative of life and caring towards others\"I think the tragedy of September 11th is a sign that we as a country have let down our national defense.  We\'ve taken our safety for granted and forgotten the importance of security and military strength.  This tragedy has brought us together though, and hopefully it will lead us to build back our strengh in national defense. \"I think my patriotism has increased over the past few weeks.  I also think my attitude towards Arab Americans has changed in a negative manner.  I think the past leader(s) of our own country are responsible for the attack.  We\'ve had many warnings leading up to this event and we were naive to believe that we could relax our defense because nothing like this could ever happen to us.  Someone might do this for a sense of power or control over our country or they might just do it because they want to get back at us for something weve done in the past.     \"For the short term, I know I have been a lot more  subdued and contemplative the past week... I think in the longer term, I will be more afraid to fly, more afraid to be in the US, or in any large city.\"\"I don\'t know if it is Bin Laden, or Saddam Hussein... Or even someone completely unrelated to those two. I would have to say simply  madmen \"\"I cannot possibly conceive of a reason. Sometimes we in Canada perceive the US as somewhat bullying, but it is just INCONCEIVABLE. \"\"I can\'t imagine how any person or group of people (though groups tend to polarize) could have so much hate that they would even consider such an act... I also can\'t imagine what point they were hoping to make or how they thought such an act could actually make anything better for themselves, as presumably they felt there would be some good to come from their terrorist actions. It has the feeling of almost a  cult  because I can\'t think of any other reason, other than being brainwashed that one would want to kill oneself and take so many innocent lives with them... in fact, as many innocent lives as possible! It is simply inconceivable to me how this plan was even arrived at, and how many people were brought to agree that it was the best course of action to achieve or to work towards whatever goals they had in mind.  I do not think this tragedy affected only the USA either. I think it has made people all over the world, certainly \'western\' countries, feel a little (or a lot) less secure, more vulnerable. I think a little bit of innocence was robbed from a great many people. \"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,1.54,2.05,0,2.57,0,9.24,0,0,0,2.05,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.13,1.03,0,0,4.11,1.03,0,0,7.19,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0.51,1.03,34.91,0,5.14,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,48.79,4.11,0,6.16,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,12.32,13.88,0,2.05,0,0,4.11,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.57,Female49bb
'more in touch with loved ones\"When i first saw the images, i was very shocked, at a loss.  but i continued on in my daily routine because i found comfort in the normal routine.  i think america has focused more on life issues since then, and everyone has found their own way to cope; some ways are more visible than others.  however, i think it was too much of a bandwagon effect with the flags and patriotic stuff.  i think a lot of people just acted that way because they felt it was the right thing to do, not because they felt sincere about their display of patriotism.  also, although the event was absolutely horrible, many people did not cope in productive ways.  they wallowed in their sorrow and felt helpless.  i think this really contributed to the economic recession. if everyone had continued on in their daily routine and not been so incapacitated by their fear, then our economy would not suffer from internal effects of decreased consumer spending, and decreased production.\"\"America failed to follow up on the situation in Afghanistan years ago; this allowed Russia to come in and the afghanistan condition to decline.  therefore, the afghanis resent america for not following up.  mostly, anit-american sentiment and too much american egotism.\"they\'re crazy; they can\'t find a better way to negotiate the problemIf only I could get the answer to this one?\"I cry a lot, I worry a lot, my espousal and I argue more.  \"\"If we only knew who to blame it would make it so easy.

I have so many emotions that I\'m trying to cope with I\'m not for sure which one is the foremost emotion that I should be coping most with. I\'m so dismayed that anyone could kill so many in such a short time span.  I had no idea the buildings would crumble like that, did anyone know the buildings would crumble.   I\'m so surprised that people could hate so much that they would kill themselves for the cause of what ever they perceived righteousness to be.  How could they be so brain washed, so out of touch with reality that they could do such a heinous crime. What could I do to help?  What could have been done to prevent this?

Terrorists  beyond that I\'m not sure anyone knows for sure\"The answer is most likely different for each perpetrator, but I suspect that frustration fueled by hate that has been taught from an early age, is the common thread.   \"I watch more TV.  I have trouble sleeping\"Overwhelming saddness!  Not only for the loss in human life, but also for the loss of innocense for our youth. There also is fear, though this emotion has lost its intensity as time passes and life in my small world returns to normal.  There is also dread, as I know the killing will continue.  We will retaliate because it seems that violence is the universal language that everyone understands.  I don\'t mean to sound unpatriotic, I just wish there was some other way.  Surprisingly, what I\'m not feeling is anger! I expect that as the saddness lifts, however anger will replace that space.    \"I have become more aware of the islomic and mulsim cultre.Because the are hateful ugly people.I really don\'t know.

Just because a few men,who were obviously sick in the head,took such and evil action, it doesn\'t mean that all arbs are like that. These men claimed religious belifs were the cause of  their actions but no religion of any kind would encourage the death of thousand of people. We should stop hating and realize who the true enemy is.\"\"When I first saw the news of what had happened, I was shocked, appalled, outraged. I had CNN on all afternoon, and some of the comments that some of the callers were making were just ridiculous. I understand that  we  were attacked, but that does not call for some of the comments that many of these people were saying. People were automatically assuming it was people from the Middle East. I think the thing that bothers me the most about the entire incident is that, although more than 3,000 people died, we have to remember all of the people who were saved and the people who saved them. I am a firm believer that killing a large group of people will not make right the deaths that occurred here. Another issue that I still think about is the kind of message that this incident must send out to other countries. We are supposed to be the super power of the World and look at us. I can\'t even imagine how many people must be laughing when they see the news and here of yet another person who managed to get past all of this new security that we have at the airports and everywhere. If a person has their mind set on doing something, they will find a way to do it, no matter what the obstacles are. Right now, I think our goal needs not to be to Osama Bin Laden, but to concentrate on the much larger issues that we have at home. I am going to be a teacher and it really frustrates me to see hear that the government cannot afford more than 2\% of its annual budget for education, but it can spend billions of dollars hunting down a man who, for all they know, is in another country right now. I am outraged at the Al Queda for what they have done to our country, but at the same time, I am outraged with our country for the hypocrisy it has created.\"\"My behaviors really have not changed at all, I\'m just much more aware of the way things really are in the world- not just the way our parents or the media, etc. want us to see them.\"I think someone might do something like this because they would want to do something to punish us for the pain and anguish that we have caused them.\"Only because of the video tapes, the Al Queda and Osama Bin Laden.\"BECAUSE THEY HATE THE USA AND WHAT WE STAND FOR\"I am shocked that something like this could happen in the usa.  I thought we were so prepared to avoid something like this.  But after thinking about it this past week, I\'m surprised it has not happened sooner.  Our airport security is very lax.  The last time I flew, I did the e-ticket, was met just inside the door with a rep holding a palm computer and was given a boarding pass without showing any ID.  A friend and her husband flew into Boston not long ago and remembers how lax things were there.  After getting lost they asked for assistance and were told to take a stairwell which they did and they ended up in a secured area. The flip side of this is 27 years ago, soming home from Germany with a newborn, I had a go thru many check points and walk the final leg of the concourse alone since my husband could not pass a certain point.  They even looked in the diaper bag I was carrying.  As shocked as I was at the time, it was done and I am not convinced that it is over.  I won\'t be flying any time too soon.  I am ready for the usa to take some action against these terrorists and also against anyone who is here illegally.  I am glad that the government is taking there time though and that they didn\'t just strike out quickly without thinking.  I realize that some innocent lives will be lost  ( as they were 9/11 ) but by waitng and preparing for this strike it may give the innocents time to leave.  I just hope we are not giving the terrorists the same opportunity.  It is hard for me to understand why after the incidents with the USS COLE and the ambassies and the last bombing of the US Trade Center that 1) we weren\'t more prepared and 2) we had not already done somthing about these terrorists being in our country.  They are here not working, but paying their bills, being educated and someone is paying the bills, and given freedom to move about no questions asked.

'The best word to summarize the events of September 11th is terrifying.  When I woke up that morning and heard the news I felt a combination of disbelief and fear.  Being of college age I have never been exposed to such a traumatic experience that hits so close to home.  I was scared for the people in New York and Washington and I was scared for my friends and family.  That morning I don\'t think anyone could predict what would follow.  There easily could have been more damage done and I believe that we were somewhat lucky that the attacks were not more widespread. I remember there were rumors flying that day.  I heard everything from a local city being bombed to the president being held hostage.  I think that when people are scared they tend to make up rumors to justify their fear.  I saw so much fear  that day.  I think there is still fear.  We now realize more than ever that the United States is vulnerable to attack. We have had the ability to attack others for so long but until now it has been difficult to understand the amount of damage  that attacks can have.  I\'m not sure how I feel about retaliation.  I would most like to see Bin Lauden brought to justice.   Although I do not agree with the politics in Afghanistan I do not feel that the innocent people there should be punished. I am scared that there will be a full scale war.  This could mean more death and destruction than we have already seen. Only time will tell how the events will effect our lives in the future but I do not want more innocent people to die.I am more aware of foreign policy and the news.  I feel that ignorance is responsible.  I think that if the terrorists truly understood who they were attacking then the attacks would be justified but they do not  understand or the attacks would not have happened.   There are many good people out there including  some of the terrorists families who did not deserve this.  Bin Lauden\"Ignorance, upbringing, neurologic brain damage that may be genetic.\"\"Anyone that is a fundamental religious terrorist fanatic, that would martry themselves for their cause.\"\"I was told by my mother to quick come upstairs. That in it of itself pushes my buttons, however, after seeing the television and hearing what had happened my (fight and flight) adrenaline kicked in and created a very uncomfortable feeling I call fear. After about five min. that seemed to subside and I realized that I had already anticipated something like this to happen. I thought it was just a matter of when and how. I did not feel surprised. For the first couple of days my feelings which were premestruation too were mostly depressed. The following day I had for the first time in a very long time an interaction with my mother that brought up a long awaited cry. This I thought was very good. I have to tell you now that I was on  vacation  from the British VIrgin Islands where I live and had just flown into Logan on a 757 from San Juan. I really noticed that Logan was very desolate and anybody with a plan could have pulled off this hijack. Anyway as the week went on I was scheduled to go into NYC and was very aprehensive about that but finally did via bus into Port Authority which also is not the most comfortable place to be in, attach or not. Being in NYC was a drag. I got most of my appointments through but for atmosphere all the department store windows down fifth Ave were black and some had American flags. This also disappointed me. I flew home without a hitch, however, my taxi driver was a Indian/Pakistanian and I wasn\'t the most comfortable with him and retrospectively invision that he too could have been a terrorist and could have done something to me. But I\'m not going to think about that. I\'m off on a plane again in two weeks to Ft.Lauderdale and that too is an area in question as it is a home for many terrorists, nonetheless my Grandmother lives there too and I have to see her and work on some business so be it. I hope for the best for our world. I am a person that holds a light of hope. I do have faith that the good will win out, however, I believe there will be more casualities during this  war . \"\"Only that I look at Arabs in general and want to make them pay for what has happened. As a Jew I\'ve always known of the dangers of the Arabs in the world, however, now it is more surfaced.\"\"they were brainwashed as children to believe that this is their purpose. Plus, they are pure evil\"Extremist Muslims who feel they are being prompted by a god whose goal is destruction of good\"Every single thing has changed.My stomach is always in a knot, I don\'t want to eat or shop or leave the house, for fear of missing some important news.  I feel more tolerant of others, especially people of other races who had nothing to do with the attacks but are being looked at with a wary eye.I try to stay home as much as possible and stay with my family.  They are really all that matters.\"\"Ever since Sept. 11, I have been feeling very afraid, agitated, jittery and profoundly sad.  I am sad for our country and feel that this may be the beginning of the end of civilization.  I have always been a positive person as far as people being more good than evil.  But evil seems to be becoming a choking, prevalent force. Because of our freedom, I feel that we have become too vulnerable to evil.  We just cannot imagine that horror is not a movie,or a book . Now there is a gravesite near here that contains things we wouldn\'t even begin to be able to imagine.  Our towns are grief stricken because our neighbors are in that smoking pile .  I read it being described as the gates of hell opened up and that\'s how I imagine it.  Nobody should have to look at that, let alone sift through it.  The fact that the evil people are in the same pile makes it worse.  How dare anyone think that their mission in life is to kill.  My children have lost their innocence and we all feel helpless and scared.  I have trouble doing  normal  things and am at a loss as to do otherwise.  I do find comfort in my church and family and the fact that we are all in this together.  But it really doesn\'t make me less afraid.  I don\'t think anything will really happen to our family specifically but I still can\'t shake the fear.  The fear of the unknown, the evil,  the devil on earth.  I do believe even more in heaven,  my faith has been made stronger just by the sheer magnitude of the situation.  We must stay strong but first we must learn how to get strong.  \"\"I was stunned by the enormity of the hit and the skill and orchestration it took to carry it out. I wasn\'t really surprised that it happened as I have always believed that it would, sometime. I can\'t say that it made me feel less safe since two members of my family have been the victims of violent crime and I live in a small town in southern NH where the crime rate is extremely low. So I am much more of a fatalist than most people. So I guess maybe that\'s why I wasn\'t as surprised that a terrorist attack was staged on US soil.  I am surprised by how emotionally I reacted to the tragedy.  I am a person who never cries but I can\'t seem to stop crying when I watch the news (or even hear it on the radio).  It was such a senseless waste of human life - absolutely innocent people were killed for no good reason. I believe that my children will live a very different life from the one that I have lived and that life in this country will never really be the same.    \"No changesI don\'t believe a sane person can understand why someone would do this.  My assumption is that it was an insane finatic.I am not sure that it was Bin Laden personally but I believe it was one of his followers.  I would like to wait until more information is availabe before deciding who was responsible.\"my behavior is not changed, perhaps I read the newspapers more carefully\"\"The terrorists, I am not 100 \% sure that Bin Laden is responsible\"I dont understand why anyone would want to kill so many innocent people\"at first I thought it was an accident, but later on I realized that it  was a terrorstic attack. Some people say that it was an act against the western world. I do not agree with that. I am affraid that the act was directed to the arrogance of the Americans who sometimes act as if the world is theirs. Nevertheless it is terrible and horrifying that these terrorists killed so many people just to make such a point. I hope this won\'t lead to a world war with the Christians against the moslims. I am affraid that the Americans will throw a bomb on Afganistan and that a lot of innocent people will be killed and others   will lose their homes and end up in even more poverty. I think the organization behind these terroristic attacks should be brought to justice. Revenge is not the right way.\"',3,-5,0,2,5,0.6,2.41,0,1.2,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,0,8.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,2.41,0,0,0,9.64,0,0,0,0,0,3.61,3.01,0,22.87,0,3.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.29,2.41,0,3.61,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.42,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb

Also they have to be somewhat crasy to do something like this (commit suicide for your beliefs!)\"I live in Iceland right  between  Europe and America and what came to my mind on september 11th was that if this could happen in a western society like america then it could just as well happen in Iceland.  And also if there would be a world war then Iceland is kind of in the middle and could be greatly affected, plains stopping in Iceland for gasoline (like they do now) and also there is an american military base here in this small country. I was also born in the USA but only lived there for 3 years while my father was studying and the Taliban say that no americans are safe whether they live in USA or elsewhere so I\'m scared for my safety. Sorry about the english. \"\"i\'m not as sure that I am safe in my country as I was before, noone\'s completely safe\"bin ladenThe events were horrible and it threatens the national security of the people. I hope everyone gets back to normal and I feel so sorry for the people who lost their lives and loved ones?0\"I try to treat people with more compassion, more understanding, and I never stay mad for any reason because life could be taken away at the blink of an eye.\"\"I was asleep, trying to avoid another day of classes, when my friend in Florida called me and told me to turn on the tv.  I asked him what channel and he said  any .  And then the events of such a tragic day unfolded right before me in my first moments of wakefulness.  I did not know what to think, what to do, who to call.  So I called my mother in tears.  The day was filled with alot of tv and a lot of crying.  It was one of the most emotionally draining days of my life.  Every word, every picture, sparked in me such a compassion for everyone else and such a deep sorrow I did not know how to feel.  Later in the day, when I saw the towers actually collapse, I did too.  So many of our wonderful and brave citizens died because other people don\'t approve of our country.  A few houes later a friend of mine called me and told me her brother was at the World Trade Center.  He did get away alive, but we did not know for many hours.  It was a painful time for my friend and I did my best to stay strong till we heard from him.  And not for a moment have I thought that the sparked patriotism has changed our country.  Each and every person who stands up for our country, stands up for every person that lost their life that horrible day.  A few months later, I opened a magazine to see at least 50 women who had their husband\'s children sometime after September 11.  Their husband\'s are dead.  And seeing all these children outraged me.  So many innocent children, not even born on September 11, won\'t even have their father around because people hated this glorious country.  I feel deep sorrow every day for what happened, for those who died, and for those who lost the people they loved.  It hurts and it will be along time until it won\'t.  But the love and devotion that many Americans still have for one another makes each day better because I know that we will get through this and show the world that we will always remain strong.\"for fear of the power we hold and for pure unbridled hatred of something they cannot haveThe Taliban and Osama Bin Ladenbecause he wanted to show his opposition to some of the acts and decisions of the USAsome terrorist group probably consisting of muslim fanatics\"in no way actually, my country is really far away. It\'s just that every time an airplane passes over my house i feel a bit nervous\"\"i was really frustrated when i first saw what had happened. It was scary and unbelievable. I now fell deeply sorry for all those people that lost their lives that day and for their families as well. I am completely sure now that one can not feel secure anywhere in the world, it\'s only a matter of luck.\"I believe that they believe it is the way to heaven.\"The people involved in the actual attacks, and any other people involved in the belief and practice of Jihad or suicide bombings/terrorism\"\"I dont feel as safe as I used to, I know that we are all vulnerable now.  I dont take for granted as much of the things and people that I have\"\"I am deeply upset by the events that took place a few weeks ago.  I remember waking up extra early that day for school, something that rarely happens.  I was watching the Today show w/my mom, when they interupted the show for a news break because the first plane crashed into the WTC.  I remember that they thought it was an accident.  During that broadcast, we actually saw the 2nd plane hit.  It was and is now so surreal and unbelievable.  All day long, and actually all week long I, along w/my family and friends were glued to the television screen, forced to see the same images over and over again.  The events that happened evoke feelings of extreme anger to deep saddness to a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness.  But, as much anger as there is, I know that it is not one whole culture\'s fault. Alot of my friends are angry at Arabs and say alot of demeaning and violent comments, but I know that is wrong, I have even seen many upset, just like the rest of us.  In summary, this event has made me realize that the U.S. is not invincible like I have grown up to think.  This has made me realize that alot of us have lived very sheltered lives.  It has also made me realize that my former attitude towards people (very cynical) has been so wrong, that in fact, people do care about other people, especially in tragic times like these.\"',4,-4,0,2,5,3.7,3.71,0,1.85,0,0,0,3.71,1.85,0,1.85,0,18.53,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.41,7.41,0,0,3.71,0,0,0,7.42,0,0,0,7.41,0,0,2.78,0,53.73,5.56,1.85,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,72.26,5.56,0,5.56,0,3.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,1.85,0,14.82,18.53,0,0,0,0,2.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb

'Cannot understand this myself. Assume these people have no respect for human life--including their own.\"I am profoundly sad. My first reaction was one of horror and disbelief and then I wanted to know that my own loved ones were safe. When I was able to reach my husband, I started to cry because I was so relieved to hear from him (he was flying at the time airplanes were ordered down), and also because I was thinking of the enormous loss people who lost their loved ones would experience. I was also angry  to think that our freedoms were being challenged. In the following days, the silence in the skies around O\'Hare was totally eerie.  I had never thought much about the planes in the sky other than to think of their beauty and gracefulness, but this halt to air travel made me think of the planes as symbols of our freedom to move around as we wish. Today I am trying to get focused on my work again and trying to get something accomplished--since I accomplished very little since Tues.\"\"I find myself with an insatiable interest in the events and the persons affected. Everyone of the victims has their story and everyone of them is loved by someone or by many who are terribly hurt by this loss, and it helps me appreciate the magnitude of the loss when I learn about individuals. I am also feeling much more patriotic and more outspoken about supporting our leaders.\"Terrorists backed by mid-East political and religious fanatics.\"I do not know anyone involved in the events of last Tues. but I have been very deeply affected by them. I can\'t concentrate, I am eating more and sleeping less, all the classic signs of depression. I have cried every day since the tragedy and I am having a hard time coping. The individuals stories are the hardest to deal with.\"\"I don\'t think I\'ll be flying anytime soon, even though logically I know it\'s safer than driving. I don\'t know that I\'ll consider going to any national monuments anytime soon.\"They are convinced the US is evil. I think because the western influence has threatened their control over their own people and they resent that.Saddam. I think he may have framd Bin Laudin so he wouldn\'t get our retribution. I am sure Bin Laudin had something to do with it but I think Saddam was the main figure.\"I definately feel more patriotic.  But, I\'m also wondering what the world would be like if we had not been so nieve to think that something like this would have never happened. \"\"American\'s in the sense that we weren\'t responsible  enough to check our security measures.  If we had,  we would have found the knives that the hijackers  used and we could have prevented them for getting on  the planes.  \"\"Well, as an American I\'d have to say that our lives are forever changed. We can no  longer go to an airport and wish our friends/relatives off with a hug or kiss because  the terrorists fixed that!   We can no longer take hardly anything metal with us in our carry-on because security might think that it\'s a weapon.  Those are things that have  changed in the airport.  America and American\'s have changed in so many ways.  One  good way that we\'ve changed is that we\'ve pulled together.  We\'re more apt to help each other now and more concerned about others.  We\'ve come to a common agreement that  American\'s aren\'t going to put up with any more terrorism Bull shit and we\'re standing behind our president and leaders.  If the terrorists want to mess with some of us, they are going to mess with all of us.  It\'s all for one and one for all!!!!!  \"\"Because that\'s what they were told to do.  They believe that killing American\'s will entitle them to go to heaven but in reality, they\'re going to hell!\"\"Although I placed a high regard for other humans of all religions, races, ethnecities,after Tuesday, I feel more patient and less accepting of others ignorant behavior.\"\"Even thought the Cold War is over, the way we live in the US is has drastically changed.  I spent 8 years active duty in the USMC in the early 80\'s and had an opportunity to leave the US on a couple of assignments.  I knew then, that Americans hadn\'t a clue why we need an Armed Forces and why we still needed Arms to protect our National Security.  I am deeply saddened that September 11, 2001 unfolded as it did, but we should have been taking gretaer and greater precautions against terrorism as we saw how are American Citizens were being treated abroad, not to mention in te 1993 WTC attack.  I too am saddened that the country I love immensley will never be the same; the tennants we are built on were demolished in one morning....I am not sure that the correct answer is retalitory strikes against a perceived enemy; but I must answer honestly that I don\'t know the correct answer.  I do know that we cannot sit by idley and wait to see what is next.  I do support my country and it\'s leaders and suspect that our leaders have access to inormation that I do not as an ordinary citizen.  I hope they use it wisely....\"\"I must admit my ignorance to the whole of the middle east.  I am too ignorant of their reasons for terrorism; all the news reports that I have have pointed the Finger at bin laden, a very rich Saudi who took refuge in Afganistan.  What I do not understand is the Taliban or it\'s purpose.  My only impression is that it is not at all good for humanity; especially towards women.\"Hate and ignorance.  Membreship in a cult that has been lead toward evil.\"Terrorist groups, with the main suspect being the talban and Bin Laden\"I really am not able to understand at all why someone would do this.  Because they feel that our nation has treated them badly or done wrong.  They have a different way of thinking than I do though because i can not even grasp the concept of being able to perform acts like these.\"My behaviors have not changed very much, except that i have a renewed patriotism for my country and i am fearful of what else may happen.\"\"I still can not even believe that the events of September 11 took place.  I honestly can not even begin to understand how someone could carry out acts such as those.   It is so terrifying to think that something like that could actually happen and that it may happen again.  There is no way to protect ourselves from people who are  willing to risk their lives just to kill other people.  I think that the way in which the acts were carried out is what bothers me the most.  Innocent people on planes were used to kill even more innocent people.  I can not even begin to imagine how the people in the planes or in the towers when they were hit felt.  I think the amount of  bravery and heroic acts done by these people is amazing.  I wish there was a simple way to make everything ok again and to make us feel safe from this happening again.   Unfortunetly, I do not think that is possible.  Now we are in the stages of taking action again the terrorists.  We are bombing them.  To me it does not make sense to kill  even more innocent people.  However, I do not have a better plan and I feel that something must be done.  I do not think we will ever be able to get rid of terorism, but  hopefully we will be able to control it somewhat and prevent acts as devastating as these from ever happening again.  These acts of terror brought our nation closer together than perhaps we have ever been.

The people who perform acts like this are scary mostly in their twisted intelligence. It is obvious that the minds behind this cowardice are smart, but twisted. It is sad that our headlines sensationalized the event with Terror written in bold. It would have been more truthful to highligt Cowardice and insanity. America has proven that we are truly an indivisible nation. This event has pulled us together in a way not seen since the Revolutionary War. We will discover through the months and years to come which nations are truly against this type of cowardice. As President Bush has stated you are either  with us or with terrorism . It is past time to eradicate this world from people who cannot control their scared little minds. People who are so twisted and afraid that their only answer is to pull others down.  These acts are the ultimate in someone crying out for attention. Is this really any different than bullies in schools who terrorize the other students - extracting lunch money, stuffing others in lockers, threatening others around them who are different or not so cool? Terrorism is a wide spread phenomenon which starts in youth and unchecked affects the entire world.  Maybe we could use this to teach our young people around the world that violence begets violence and teach them how to diplomatically discuss and issue. Debate should be a major subject in schools around the world and worldwide competitions should be held.  We, as a world, can learn to respect one another\'s differences and reveal in the diversity of our world. We have an opportunity to do great things for the good of all in light of this evil act of cowardice that has been inflicted upon the world.

One of my kids, Raju Bhuiyan, painted a message to his cousin and his cousin\'s wife, newlyweds who worked at Marsh McLennon. On top of the grief of this loss, his family is suffering hate.  When I talked with his mom, she described how she encountered aggression in people\'s eyes and gestures and in their physical presence as she went to work.  Raju\'s father is also concerned for Raju\'s safety.   His father was there when two men were shot on the 13th as they were leaving the mosque after prayers; that was outside his mosque in Church Avenue (Brooklyn).  The mosque has had to shut.  Some of our kids are witnessing this anti-Asian and anti-Muslim violence.  I also think that some of them are perpetrating it.  Others are being victimized by it, especially girls wearing chadr or salwar kameez.  Yesterday evening, visiting Shumi Hakim\'s family, who live above the mosque at 11th Street and 1st Ave, I learned that her mother and her sister have still not been outside.  She told me that she is scared to work at her Kmart job after school, and to stay for afterschool homework, but that she can stay if a teacher will walk her home. The group has built and painted two memorials.  Tomorrow, Thursday, we will go to complete the second, at the corner of Rutgers and Madison, by LaGuardia Houses.  The Project Reach counselors we are working with are amazing.  The kids said it was fun.  We got done yesterday at 8:30pm, and they were all back at 10:30 this morning in front of East Side -- from the Bronx, from Orchard Street, from Campos.  Once the second is done, the Relief Coalition has plans to construct 6 more over the weekend, into next week.   In addition, members of the Coalition are going door-to-door visiting people who are elderly, disabled, or isolated.  There is enough volunteer work for anyone who wants to participate, and wonderful people with experience to guide us in the work and the feelings.  Plus, the kids get to know the people and the offices of Project REACH as they go along, and may decide to get involved with REACH on their own.  Project REACH is the by-youth, for-youth organization that helped us set up our gay-straight alliance, the A-B Squad (as in Anti-Bias; Marc Ottaviani is coordinating staff support), last spring. Send anyone who wants to join the volunteer work to room 318 at 3pm, on Thursday and Friday. Kiran \"000\"I don\'t know.  I think it\'s interesting that after the OK City bombing the US rushed after foreign terrorists and, come to find out, it was a US citizen who was responsible.  I think it\'s important not to jump to conclusions (though clearly many people have)\"\"I don\'t feel patriotic--a reaction many of my fellow citizens seem to feel.  I do, however, feel intensely sad and mournful.  I don\'t think so much about the buildings and the attack on American symbols--I think about the lives, I think about the cell phone calls before the various crashes, I think about the pets.   I\'ve also started feeling angry--I see a lot of behavior and hear a lot of opinion that seems to deepen the cleavage between  us  and  them.   I fear this mentality will only perpetuate racism, hate, and more terror.  I\'m angry that the media showed images of Arab individuals celebrating.  I don\'t think we have reason to believe that those individuals knew the entire story--the number of lives lost, etc.  Additionally, my stomach turns when I hear how some Americans are reacting to these images--I heard one guy say he\'d like to put a bullet between that kid\'s eyes.  We\'re such hypocrites--I would bet a large sum of money that if  we  bomb/hurt/kill  them,  there will be THOUSANDS of Americans out celebrating in the streets.  But, of course,  we  will feel justified in our actions because we had a reason.  A little perspective taking might suggest that  they , too, had a reason--a reason which I think  we  need to try to understand.  I also keep asking myself,  Where are the women in all of this?   I am a woman and I feel as though the coverage of this event has distanced me from the reality.  I hear the people on the street saying,  We\'re all brothers in this,  and I hear the firefighters saying  We only call each other brother.   I don\'t know for a fact, but probability suggests there were women firefighters lost also.  The men on the PA flight tried to take over the terrorists--what were the women doing?  I can\'t be too upset about this particular flight--for all I know the women were also rebelling and I\'ve only heard about that one phone call.  I heard a piece on the radio this morning.  Four or five people were asked what they would be willing to give up to overthrow terrorism.  All four or five people were men--again, where are the women.  I\'m tired of hearing about all the heroes--I want to acknowledge the heroines. I\'m worried about my Arab peers.  I want to patronize Afghanie businesses.  I see Muslim students walking around--never alone, silent--I don\'t think they did this a few weeks ago.  There\'s a big fat elephant in my classroom and I don\'t know how to address it. I don\'t know if I want to address it. It bothers me that so many of the fund raisers are being held for the families of the firefighters and other rescue workers.  Are their lives more valuable than the thousands of people who were in the towers?  I think all the funds should be used for all the people.   In sum, I guess I just feel angry.  And I feel like I\'m outside of all of this looking in and getting angrier and more disappointed at the threat of additional hate and death.\"\"Who ever did this, I think, was desparate to get a message across.  I wonder if the person or people responsible have tried to get a message across but didn\'t feel anyone listened.  I don\'t think 19 people would willingly die if they didn\'t believe this was for a good cause--however subjective that might be.\"\"Watched tons of television, cried myself to sleep Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night, calling my friends and family just to hear their voice, feel very clingy to my husband\"I\'ve sent money to different charity organizations and I haven\'t really said anything bad about President Bush. The latter is a major change!\"1. It was a devastating thing. Both the magnitude and because it penetrated our sense of invulnerability. It was impossible not to keep thinking about all those innocent, unsuspecting people. 2. As someone who flies regularly, it made me realize that the terrorists could have taken any plane they wanted and nothing could be done about it. 3.  I had been concerned for a long time about the apparent insensitivity of the US to the plight of the Palestinians. Now, it seems like we are going to be made to pay for that insensitivity. 4. Because we can\'t identify who the enemy is, we are going to have to be vigilant. Americans had had the luxury of feeling safe and secure. No more.\"Bin Laden did it to further his religious/political agenda. The actual participants did it out of a misguided sense of what Islam is.Osama Bin Laden\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"They feel that they were wronged in some way.

'\"I am scared to fly and have to fly in two weeks to a conference. I will not look for the cheapest ticket, but something that for one reason or the other feels more secure and will not fly out of Boston.\"\"Because of hate, reasons for which are VERY complex\"Osama bin Laden\"I vividly remember that day and the moment I heard what happened. We had a break in our seminar, a couple of us went to get a cup of coffee, when a colleague came and said what had happened. I do not remember her exact words. I can hear the word bombing, although I am not sure if she really used it, or the first thing that came to my mind was war, especially when I herd that the Pentagon was attacked, and war means bombing. The whole Department, all the faculty and grad students, was in the main office and we were listening to the news on the radio, still having problems comprehending what happened. I guess I will never understand how someone could have done this. My best friend is from NYC and he happened to be in the city that day, because he had to attend a funeral. He has a tendency of being at weird places looking for random coffee shops where to do work. Although I know there are no cute coffee shops in the WTC area, I was worried sick if he was OK. Of course, I could not get him on the phone, cell phones were dead and could not reach him at home either until that afternoon. Everything was fine luckily. The other thing that made this surreal event more real to me was the fact that I fly pretty frequently from Boston to LA, and two planes on this route crashed. It definetely does not happen to other people, it could have happened to anyone, me included. I was glued to the TV for the next two or three days. The pictures looked like war time Vukovar or Sarajevo. One more thing to make it more personal. I am from Croatia, and have fresh memories of the war. War memories do not fade. This was like a fleshback in the reaches of the dark side of human nature. I was shocked and I was scared. Even the word war is scary. Americans do not really know what is a war and calls to a war are that more alarming. Yes, something has to be done, but not going to Afganistan to kill all the people there. They are people too and doing that we would not show to be any better. I spend a whole class time in my intro class the day after the attack to process the event with my students. There was just one student who wanted to kill everyone in the Arab world (and I am not exagerating here!). The students were shocked, but thought about the consequences of possible US reactions. I am now whatching TV much less. It is hard to look at the pictures of NYC. I love the city, it is probably my favorite city in the world. A hurt city now. I wonder what is going to happen next. I do not consider the president to be a particularly intelligent individual, and that scares me even more. I do not believe he is able to handle it. I just hope there is someone in his environment who is able to both think and feel. I have read the results of a GAllup poll saying that more than a half of Americans support that Arab Americans wear special IDs. REminiscent of an episode in history about 50 years ago... The event itself is horrible enough, but there will be long term consequences larger even than the pile of debris in NYC. The discrimination has started already, and it is not even limited to the Arab Americans. A friend, a student from SIngapore was fired from her job a few days after the attacks, with the explanation that she is foreign. I am scared. If a war starts, nothing and no one will be secure any more. Today I heard about the vulnerability of nuclear plants...\"\"I am a US citizen, but I was in Stockholm, Sweden, when the attacks occurred.  I wonder whether that fact has influenced my subsequent reaction to events.  There were two sides to being away from my country, good and bad.  First, the people around me reacted differently than if I had been at home (California).  Even as the news was still breaking, and afterward as people tried to describe exactly what had happened, life, in Sweden and all of Europe, went on.  Life went on.  People shopped, ate out, drove their cars, took public transportation, etc.  Everyone was sad and concerned and very supportive, but they still went on with their daily lives.  When I returned home a few weeks later, I learned that the US had essentially stopped for a few days.  I think the reaction of a community has to color an individual\'s perceptions and later reactions, regardless of that individual\'s innate personality.  So seeing the whole country shut down in shock and fear has to affect you differently than watching events develop in a country that marks the event with sadness but doesn\'t completely stop.  So I think that part of being abroad was good for me.   The day after the attack, I joined an American friend in Estonia, who had been living in Russia for the past year.  That\'s when the bad part of being abroad started to emerge.  My friend was, I discovered, quite prone to anxiety, and I think that her isolation from other Americans made her anxiety worse.  She was completely obsessed with trying to find news and spouted conspiracy theories and bloodlust and constantly fretted about war and bombing and on and on.  It was irrational and uncomfortable.  I am still worried about her, now that I\'m back in the US and she\'s alone in Russia again.  When I left, she was obsessing over whether to cancel a vacation she had scheduled with her mom, because  maybe it\'s not right to take a trip at a time like this .  She even agonized over whether or not she should send some gifts for friends home with me, because again,  it seems wrong to be giving gifts right now .  I told her that she was being ridiculous and that we all have to go on with our lives.  It\'s not disrespectful to live normally.  You have to grieve, but you can\'t stop living.  That\'s part of healing.    So I guess that was the downside of being abroad.  My friend and I were alone in dealing with the attacks.  I think you can be helped along by having a community around you.  It might be easier to be caught in a spiral of fear if you\'re alone and without a bunch of different people\'s views and voices and reactions to experience that you can filter through and use to arrive at your own (but hopefully moderated) perception. I tended to take a much more detached, long-term, big-picture sort of approach (and my rather non-emotional reaction was probably stronger than usual because I was trying to set myself apart from my friend\'s extremely anxious mood).  yes, it was awful.  yes, i am grieving.  yes, I am angry.  But I also acknowledge that this and other world events are always more complex than the politicians or the media would have us believe, and I think my long-term view of things helps me keep it in perspective. I actually think that the world didn\'t really truly change on September 11.  Our perception of it did.  Humans have done horrible things to each other through all of history, and we\'ll do it again, but we keep going, somehow.  Europe didn\'t convulse in terror, partly because they were on another continent, obviously, but also because they have the collective memory of war.  They\'ve been through truly wretched stuff, including recent terrorism, and lived.  I think we (americans) just need a little toughening and unfortunately some huge and horrible like the terror attacks was our wake-up call.  Am I happy about this?  No.  Do I want ware or terrorism or uncertainty?  No, of course not.  But you have to live with what you\'ve got.  You don\'t have to like it, and you should work to make things better, but I think you have to be rational about your situation before you can be effective.  We can do it, it\'ll just take time to adjust to our new perception of the world.  And I think we\'ll eventually get a grip and move on.  It\'s just going to take time. I do think the US has made some unfortunate decisions that have contributed to the creation of anti-American terror groups.  We\'ve supported opposition groups in the past that have later become the new enemy.  And now in Afghanistan we\'re doing it all over again.  We\'ve taken an extremely pro-Israeli position in a conflict in which neither side is blameless.  It has always seemed silly to me, but apparently to some people it is worth killing over. I don\'t think that terrorism is a reasonable solution to any problem.  In fact I don\'t even think it\'s ever worked as a solution.  But I do think that people of all nationalities and religions turn to absurd extremes when they\'re unhappy or afraid.  It\'s a way of feeling in control.  And American policy has either directly contributed to or completely ignored situations in which large numbers of people are poor, resentful, unhappy, afraid, and feeling out of control and without hope.   I really, really, really hope that we allow food aid to reach the thousands of Afghan refugees before winter sets in.  I hope that after we finally stop bombing, that we work for peace and freedom and giving hope to people, instead of simply walking away from the wreckage, leaving them to nurse their injuries and fear into hatred.  How we can do that is beyond me - how do you replace fundamentalist theocracies with systems that give people hope without looking like meddlers who are destroying culture?  I hope we take a more balanced approach in the middle east, one that is more likely to lead to peace.  I don\'t think that doing this is  giving in  to terrorists\' demands.  I think it\'s finally implementing policies that actually work. Here at home, I hope that Americans will become more aware of world events and try to see how interconnected everything can be.  I\'m glad to see efforts toward building tolerance and maintaining civil liberties.  I think Americans are friendlier than they were before the attacks.  I am glad to see mental health care get a boost, even if it is catalyzed by such horrible events.  I hope that we can use this opportunity to make real progress in mental health care generally in this country.  I think there have been some very useful discussions and debates since the attacks.  I don\'t think americans really consider all sides of situations very often (in fact I often agree with the stereotype that Americans are ignorant and don\'t want to think), so this has been nice to see, although we\'re settling back down into our entrenched positions again.  That\'s unfortunate.  I\'m sad to see the edges of national anxiety.  Reports of doctors prescribing antibiotics and people stockpiling survival or warfare supplies are especially disappointing.  (I\'m a biologist and all too aware of how overuse and abuse of antibiotics has led to many of our current infectious disease problems).  I have never liked the simplistic, sensationalist bent of our media.  I think the media just might be contributing to national mental health problems.  If there were ever a time for rational, educational, analytical news, now would be it!  Most of all, I wish people would just calm down and think.  I am very curious to know what our history books will say about this in 50 years.  What were the right choices, what could we have done better?  What will be better and worse about our world after all of this has come to some sort of equilibrium (or stalemate)?   I would guess that I am less emotional and more analytical and rational about all of this than most people.  Perhaps it\'s partially defensive denial, who knows?  I\'ve always been a calm, analytical type who disapproves of hystrionics.  I think it\'s a healthier route than many other people are taking.  No one benefits from panic. Good luck with your study.  I hope you learn a lot and can use your results in useful ways.  Thanks.\"\"Not much.

'\"I was listening to the radio the morning of September 11th.  Every new report was different.   At work most everyone listened to the radio and came out into the hallways to discuss each new update and what it meant. Since I work near the Capitol I was sent home at lunchtime.   A little while later I got a phone call from my older brother who lives in Florida.  He had been flying between Florida and California on business and was stuck in Houston.  He caught a bus to Austin and we spent several days together before he was able to get a flight home.  That really brought home the impact of the plane crashes. Wednesday I also found out that several co-workers were stranded in New York, Chicago and California where they had been travelling on business.   Family members in Manhatten and Washington DC emailed their stories about what occured.   All in all it brought home the message that  Life is Short and we should live each day to the fullest .\"\"Apparently Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who support the Taliban.  It appears to be retribution for years of US actions like supporting Kuwait, and Israel.  It is ironic that the US probably trained some of these leaders in the Afghanistan war against the Russians.  \"\"I tell my family and friends that I love them every time I talk with them.  I am concerned about friends and family that are travelling.  I did not have any trips planned, so I haven\'t cancelled travel plans.  I will consider all my options before planning a trip to any location that could be a terrorist target -- such as airports, theme parks, etc.  I work in the Capitol of Texas area and my employer has stepped up security access to our building and parking garage.  I am reminding my coworkers to wear their badges visably (as required by the new policy) when I see someone who has it tucked in their pocket.  Many of my coworkers who routinely didn\'t wear their badges during the day, now wear them.\"\"Their belief system is corrupted.  My understanding is Islam is that violence is not advocated.  I believe that these terrorists believed they were acting out of religious faith.  However, I think that the religious leadership who taught them these concepts is flawed.  Because the countries that these people come from have severely restricted press, relgious and freedom of information I do not think that the flow of information can be altered except by the people themselves.  My hopes are that moderate religious leaders will take charge and lead their people to a different path.\"Cancelling travel plans both business and pleasureI suspect that the media is correct and that it could be an organization assocaited with Bin LadenBecause of hatred and being brainwashed by their religious beliefs.\"I think that this event forced me to think about my own and my family\'s safety.  Also the fact that terrorism is an unpredictable event, it makes it harder to deal with it, because we do not know whether changing our behavior (e.g., moving away or out of the country, changing jobs to attempt to guarantee security) will actually have a positive result on our life or will keep us trapped inside out own heads because of fear.  \"\"the muslim terrorist groups are blamed for it, I would rather think that it is true\"\"I would rather say that it is not my behavior but representation of situation, attitudes these things got changed\"\"for political reasons, I think\"\"The first idea was that it is not true, it cannot happen, it is terrible and the worst thing was that you cannot do anything about it. The situation is not under control. I was shoked and I needed some time in order to understand what is going on. To adjust to the situation. I thought a lot about people who planned and organised it... How do they feel about it? Are they happy? I thought about people in these airplanes. How was that to be there to see it, to call your famile to say that you will die in few minutes. Also, I thought that life it very fragile and in some situation you cannot do anything, it is too late.  Then, it was a feeling that now the world became different and these events deeply affected people\'s minds...    \"\"That is a hard question.  Every thing points to bin Laden, but who will really know?  Ultimately the devil is responsible.\"\"I am more aware that my next day - or even the next minute is not a guarantee!

How could this happen to us?  We are America after all and we don\'t have war on our soil.  But then I began to realize - why not us?  How arrogant to think that we are above this.  But it was and still is so hard to imagine that there are people out there who would do something like this.  I thought of the day John F. Kennedy was assasinated and how unreal that felt at that time.  My parents thought of Pearl Harbour! At this time, my heart goes out to those that don\'t know yet.  Although, by now the realization that their loved ones are not coming back has got to be more real.  But it is so hard to have closure, when you aren\'t sure.  I also feel for the mother\'s that lost sons who were the terriorists!!  Their hearts must be breaking - how could their sons do this! It is so wonderful to see American\'s once again taking pride in their country!!!  We lost that pride somewhere during the conflice in Vietnam.  And it is so wonderful to see American\'s being neighbors again and really really caring for one another.  If anything good can come from a tragedy - this will be two of them. Being so far removed from NY it is hard to comprehend what has really happened.  It is sort of like watching the evening news and hearing about things like this in the Middle East.  If one could see it first hand, I am sure that this would have a greater impact on one\'s life.\"\"I\'m staying home more, shop only for necessities (a spending spree feels disrespectful, somehow).  \"They must be thoroughly poisoned by hate. \"I am still feeling numb--it still hasn\'t sunk in for me.

My thoughts are ranging from wondering about what the future will be like--how will the economy change, how hard will it be to travel?  Will we lose our freedoms and civil rights?  Then I feel anger that we can hold our own lives so precious that we\'ll go to war or whatever when 10,000 of us die.  Yet 30,000 civilians died in Nicaragua, in terrorist/guerilla attacks by the CIA-funded contras, and we don\'t think anything about that.

We thought someone was knocking on their door. I held back tears until I watched, live, Tower 2 collapse. That was too much to see it as it happened. The group of people I was with stopped watching TV after that to pray. That really helped me keep my focus on my knowledge and understanding that God is still in control and man has proven that he is not in control. I am overwhelmed by the extent of the tragedy - number of people who have died; how many businesses/departments are completely wiped out; how our economy will be/is being affected by the concerned for travel; how many insurance companies are going to go bankrupt and be unable to pay insurance claimes? I also feel sad for the families of those who fought the terrorists on the plane that crashed in PA. It seems that their heroic efforts are often forgetten in that most references are made to NYC and DC, but not PA (including your paragraph above). I have moved on with my life, but I know that is easier for me because I am not directly, personally touched by this tragedy. I know second and third hand of losses, but nothing in my circle of family/friends.\"because there is evil in this world.\"I have more conversations about spiritual issues with students on the campus where I work, but other than that I don\'t think my behaviors have changed.\"\"I do not know, and am not convinced by the news reports.\"',3,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.2,0,0,0,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.8,0,0,7.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.6,0,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.4,0,0,7.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.8,7.8,0,0,0,0,10.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb
'They feel the US needs to pay for what it has done to other countries. \"When I first heard the news, I was scared and wondered what would be  hit next. I then became concerned about how I was getting home that night. While I think what happened was horrible, I have never once cried about it or had PTSD-like symptoms. I believe the US should seek revenge for what happened, but I think it is unfortnate that Afghan civilians will have to lose their lives. In the end, I am overwhelmed by all of this and wish I could escape from it. I am tired of hearing how awful it was and how people have been so deeply affected by it. It reminds me that I am either in denial about how it has affected me or it just hasn\'t. \"It hasn\'t.\"I\'m not one to jump on the Osama Bin Laden bandwagon. While the US seems to feel he is responsible, I will make my final decision when they release a document  stating specifically while they feel he had any  involvement. \"\"To make a statement that can not be ignored, and to instigate a response from the USA (to bring our forces over there where the attacks will undoubtedly continue)\"\"If I have to name specific people, I believe that Osama bin Laden and his followers are behind it.  However, I think that it is naive to blame individuals without looking at the potential causes for their actions.  I would rather blame the inequities and poor political interactions between the USA and the countries of the middles east.\"\"The events of September 11th are a tragedy for our nation, but especially for people who had friends or relatives hurt or killed in the attacks.  Luckily, the people I know who had a reason to be in the WTC were not hurt.  I am deeply saddened by the stories of the people who did not survive.  In fact, when I see the footage of the attack -- the planes flying into the buildings and the buildings collapsing -- it is not as disturbing as I would expect it to be.  I think that this is because I have grown up in a time of blockbuster movie special effects.  The scene does not seem real to me.  I only felt personally in danger for a short time.  When I think about the individual people, that is when I break down.  Can you imagine being on a plane and seeing what is about to happen but not being able to stop it?  Or the emergency workers who continued to enter the building, even as it was collapsing.  Or being trapped in a stairwell because your wheel chair can\'t make it.  Some of the worst stories for me to think about are the ones in which people called from cell phones.  If I could only have a few minutes to talk to the love of my life before I died, the last thing I would want to talk about is the details of the attack.  I can\'t imagine how sad that must have been.  I feel so sorry for all of the families that have been hurt by this tragedy.  I am also scared of how other Americans are reacting.  I don\'t know what I would do if I were Arab-american.  I understand that people are angry and frustrated, but they can\'t hold an entire race of people responsible for the actions of a few.  I fear that this attack is only going to make us retaliate in a bigger way, and then we will go back and forth and more innocent lives will be lost.  Where will it end?  This is a scary time to be alive.\"\"I say  I love you  or  take care  more to my family and friends than I did before.

'\"The events that happened on september eleventh were astonishing and tragic.  Coming home from class that afternoon and turing on the tv, just seeing the terrifying tragedy that happened made me shiver.  This really hit home, i have heard my parents and grandparents talk about war, death, and tragedy, but you could never really understand it until you experince it yourself.  Now that we are at war because of these horrible terrorist atttacks, i am scared and nervous.  My friends who are in the army just 18-30 years old are being shipped off, who knows if i will ever see them again.  this was a tragic event and someing, some type of action needs totake place.  Just like what we are doing now.  I just pray everyday for the families and friends of the people involved in this tragedy.  \"bin lodinhave not really except more prayer for those involved and my friends who have been called in \"hate for a group of people, but took it out on too many innocent people\"\"For the first week, we hung an American flag outside our home\'s front door.  I am rethinking my decision to fly to my brother\'s wedding this December (I can drive their in one day, but it will be a pain, and I admit that a $1000 repair bill for the furnace is probably going to be the actual deciding factor).\"\"At first, disbelief, then worry about NY relatives, and then anger.  As of yet, we have not started an actual war involving bombs and invading armies, and I hope we don\'t have to do that.  It seems to me that moving troops around is a good form of psychological warfare.  I realize that we may have to physically (and publically) attack, but I hope it can be resolved with covert and financtial action.  I feel deep sadness that we may end up destroying another country, and deep worry that the terrain in Afganistan may destroy many of our people if we go in for a ground war.  I find myself wishing that an assassin can take care Osama Bin Ladin, and hope that will demoralize the rest of the extremists enough so they will leave us alone.  \"\"A Muslim extremist group, but I don\'t have strong feelings about which one is responsible.  Public evidence seems to lead to the Taliban, possibly with a goverment backing or support. Which government, I have no idea.\"\"They don\'t like our way of life.  They feel Americans are too intrusive in their part of the world.  They may not like the way Isreal is western (like us) and we are Isreal\'s allies.

To feel superior, and to take revenge \"\"The Taliban, Bin LAden in particular\"\"what happened was about as shocking as one could imagine anything being. I felt deeply saddened at all those people who lost their lives, but more so for their relatives and friends who they left behind who have to deal with the loss. I feel so disgusted and angry at the people who committed this act, and at first felt very bitter towards Muslims in general. I understand more now that they as a religion are not to blame, but it is still hard to feel like they are allies having seen those pictures on TV about them being happy about the bombing.\"They haven\'tTo cause conflict\"It is so difficult to absorb the fact that someone could do something this evil and that it would result in two large towers reduced into rubble not to mention the human lives lost.  When I first heard that a plane had hit the World Trade Tower on the radio, I turned on the television when I got to the office and could see the building in flames.  You could see people at the windows waving and I knew they would not be able to escape.  I felt very helpless.  When the second plane hit the other tower, I knew this was not just an accident and immediately knew it was the work of Bin Laden.  I don\'t know how I knew.  I just knew and told the other office workers that it was Bin Laden and they would find any weakness they could.  It was not over. I could barely concentrate that day to do my work at the office.  I kept looking to the television for more news because I did not know what might happen next.  Was there more horrors in store?  Then the plane hit the Pentagon.  All of this was so impossible to believe.  The United States was truly under attack, the place I always felt was safe from attacks like this! I was in a state of great anxiety and did not feel safe anywhere.  I had to watch the news on TV constantly to see what was new to develop and what countries would join us against terrorism.   Seeing the president react to this tragedy and my growing feelings of patriotism was calming and I shared in an American\'s feelings of determination to defeat this evil.  I was also concerned for our soldiers. I also had a feeling of sadness for a loss of innocence.  Things will not be the same again. It is unbelievable that these terrorists would be educated in our universities and turn this against us in an attempt to destroy our society.  I have lost some trust and feel a sense of betrayal. I am also sad for the children that must live in a world like this. I am also recalling seeing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie that showed him flying a plane through an office building.  They used our own culture against us. I am worried about what is in store for us in the future.  When I wake up in the mornings, I know all of the possibilities have been going through my mind because I am so depressed.  Once I get into the office and get back to my normal routine, I feel a little better. There have been times at home I have been able to laugh again, but I must take breaks away from the news to watch  Leave It To Beaver  and old movies to escape from this reality. I do have confidence in the world\'s ability to defeat this threat to democracy.  This is truly a war between modern culture and ancient culture.  We will prevail.\"\"I have attempted to go on with my normal life, but with great anxiety.\"bin Laden00I have become less trusting of people.\"Initially, I was horrified.  I felt really threatened, as though the world was going to  enter into a nuclear war.  I was extremely concerned about my son and didn\'t want him to watch the events unfolding on the television. I was very scared that it was going to be an  escalating situation.   Next, I felt really sad, especially when someone pointed out  to me how people were jumping out of windows.  That really made me feel ill.  I also kept thinking about the film  Independence day - especially with the huge cloud moving down the NY street.  Then I started to think about the incident and to realize that there were huge implications economically and  socially.  I then went into work and started chatting with fellow staff members.  They seemed shocked but I felt that they couldn\'t \'meet me\' emotionally so I kept quiet.  I was very keen to have access to web page news, but it was very slow.  Eventually, our department set up a television screen and we watched, while we tried to go on with our \'normal\'  academic duties.  I was very concerned for colleagues who had been watching the television overnight and hadn\'t been able to go to bed.  They seemed very traumatized.  A number of students were upset.  Later, I started to get concerned about people I knew who I believed  were in New York and I started emailing colleagues to check on them.   I have since compartmentalized the incident and the recent US response in my mind.  For example, I am often aware of thinking along the  lines of  well, that is a long way away  and  even in times of war, you have to  get on with your life .  I am however, very concerned.  A list-server group that I subscribe to over the internet has been discussing the events after someone in our group suggested that we might take some action: eg. express sympathy.  I have found a lot of the comments rather pathetic, especially given that people couldn\'t agree to even express sympathy to the victims and just wanted to make political points about it all.  I thought, how extremely academic and ineffectual. Even overnight (it is now the 10 October),  I was lying awake (for other reasons)and at one stage I was thinking about how widespread it could all become: especially when it is biological based.  I hope the world finds peace, but frankly, I am not that hopeful.  I am also concerned for future generations.  I am concerned because important issues such as the protection of the environment will take second place for a very long time to come.    \"',3,-5,0,2,5,2.53,2.53,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,3.79,0,1.26,0,15.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.16,0,0,1.26,10.75,0,0,0,5.69,0,0,0,3.16,0,0,1.26,0,47.4,0,6.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,63.19,5.06,0,14.54,0,1.26,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.21,15.79,1.26,0.63,0,0,1.26,0,0,2.53,0,0,0,0,1.26,0,0,1.26,Female49bb
'Terrorist groups in many countries under the direction of Osama bin Laden and his god.\"More understanding of all Americans, more interest in neighbors, more realization that this country is made up of many cultures and people all of whom are as American as those who established this country as a refuge. Now I own a patriotism that was not there before.\"\"On September 11th I heard the news of the 1st plane, didn\'t take it with too much emotion, then like everyone else, the gravity of the situation slowly began..when the Pentagon was listed as another site of a crashing plane I lost my distance. My brother works in the Pentagon. I emailed, phoned home and to his cell, no word. Several hours later my family heard that he was alright, the plane crashed on a different corridor. One of the survivors. Since that day, although my personal concern was safe I began to  live  as if it was not. Suddenly my brother was your brother, yours, mine. If your brother, mother, husband, wife, child, etc. was lost or missing, so was mine! The grieving continues today, two weeks later. I listen to the stories and can\'t just listen dispassionately. I couldn\'t sleep for several nights ,waking with visions of the WTC in my head; listening to the anguished relatives/friends of those dead and missing. At first retaliation was decidedly the main emotion, turning to sorrow, then a resolve, as most Americans have now, to continue to help those interested in preserving our freedoms and those trying to secure our homeland. I work with psychologists who are overwhelmed helping people concerned with the future of our country - their own futures. I listen to people returning from ground zero filled with stories of the horror seeing the gross destruction and wonder at the great humanity of fellow humans. It is a new world and we are setting out tentatively...to honor the memory of those who lost their lives we will put our feet, one after another, on the ground and keep moving forward. To make sure the terrorists are not winners, we will dig in our heels and commit to this war, not against a nation (for there is no single terrorist nation to my knowledge) but against the real evil, men who honor a god that causes and approves such blind  faith  in followers and that allows praise for terror upon innocents.\"\"The US is not without fault and we are just beginning to recognize, as a nation that we have perpetrated atrocities (either real or imagined) against those countries and peoples in the Middle East\"Bin Laden and associates\"I am a frequent flier, and will hesitate to fly until they revamp airport/airplane security.

However, I also think that Americans are naive, and we walk around thinking we are the greatest country, and that we are immune to the problems that many other countries deal with.  I think that our federal government failed us in terms on not providing tighter security.  When you think about it, the hijackings were a simple idea that could be easily carried out, and we left ourselves vulnerable to it, living by the idea that no one would WANT to do it to us.  If any good can come of this, it is that America will realize that we are vulnerable, and hopefully have better security be a priority so more lives don\'t have to be lost.  \"\"September 11 attack shocked not only the American citizens, but also the other part of the world.  The economy of the country dropped drastically after the attack, especially the airline ones.  I do believe, though that United States citizens can go through this situation and the government will do anything it takes to catch the terrorists down.  \"Someone would do this just because they know that U.S. is the power of the world.Cannot make guilty anyone for what happened.\"Somewhat have changed, but toward positive changes.\"\"I don\'t think there is a single group or person, this was a focused, deliberate and well-funded and planned attack.

I\'m trying to figure out how I can be more involved in this mission.  My children are grown, last one is in 2nd year of college and my household responsibilities are minimal, and although I work full-time, I have plenty of time and expertise to contribute to these efforts.   I\'m concerned about the children who haven\'t learned to hate or be prejudice.  I\'m also worried about the young men and women who are just beginning their lives, how much this terror has changed the world and our feelings of security.   During the past ten days, I have been unfocused, find myself very emotional and trying to understand why or how someone learns to hate so much?   If the people in this world who wreck havoc and create wars channeled their energy into positive directions, just think how much we would all benefit from their passions and committment.  It is a shame that it took something of this magnitude to bring people back to showing their patriotism, but maybe we needed a cause to unite us as a nation.  I\'m very proud of the efforts and solidarity we are seeing and even more proud of President George W. Bush.  He has stepped up to the plate and is demonstrating real leadership, levelheadedness and a committment to rid the entire world of the mass of zealots who terrorize all nations.   If we work together as a team, we can manage so much more than we\'ve ever done before.  Thanks for listening.  B\"I believe that there are people who are evil and haven\'t learned to channel their energies and talents into positive areas.  I don\'t begin to understand how or why someone hates anyone or anything this much...it truly escapes my understanding.   I also think other countries envy what we have and how we live and want to destroy this.I\'m much more concerned about my husband\'s travel but glad that more measures are being taken to provide security.  I find myself thinking that we ought to really look at all foreign nationals and rethink our open door policy.

Then fear at what would happen concerning world peace and stability.  Concern for a friend in the states at that time.  Beginning to wonder what on earth could have motivated such an attack, beginning to wonder about US foreign policies (about which I knew practically nothing).  Puzzled as to why the States had no warning, with all their expertise in this area.  Although it is \'closer to home\' happening in the States, than in some of the more volatile areas of the world, I still don\'t find myself empathising with the American people as much as some of my friends do.  I seem to take the view that the human race as a whole has been killing each other, often very violently, for as long as it has been around (as well as exploiting each other).  Whether it is Americans who die, or Africans, or Arabs, the result to date is that as a human breed we still have not learnt basic human rights, or how to live together amicably and peacefully.  I don\'t see the Americans as blameless or innocent in this, but I totally disagree with employing further violence in retaliation.  Because politics is definitely not my strong point, I feel a sense of helplessness as I struggle to understand why this happened, what the ramifications are, and how we can change to break these patterns of violence and exploitation to fellow humans.\"',3,-4,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0,9.12,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.61,0,0,1.96,1.3,0,0,2.6,0,0,0,3.26,0,0,0,0,24.76,1.96,1.3,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,32.57,3.91,0,1.96,0,0.65,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,7.82,7.81,3.26,0,0,0,4.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,Female49bb
'\"I think that it is terribly sad and disappointing that it took God to allow such an awful event to take place for our nation to come together instead of going against eachother.  Even more so, that it took this to occur before people started to believe God is real and now that He is our only foundation of hope will they pray to Him for help and reassurance when He was there the whole time.  Our nation once pushed God out of the land He created, and thousands of innocent people had to die before we let Him back in.  We complain about justice being brought unto those responsible,however, I feel we are dealing with something completely out of our hands.  This event is in the hands of God, and no matter what actions we take, He will be the only one to bring justice to the persons responsible.  What we are speaking of is not justice but revenge.  There has to be another way.

The media has drawn it out so much and people are acting like it\'s WW3, it\'s not. Pearl Harbor was more devistatind in my opion and more gutsy. Yes we should attack, but only the ones responsible. That way others will think twice before attacking again. We have been aging others on for so long saying we are the all mighty, but we are just a country that is still a teenager and we act like it too. I personally am sick of hearing about it.

I still get emotional, I still startle when I hear a plane or a loud sound, and I don\'t know when the next time will be that I will ever get on a plane again.  I was planning to go this Christmas, but after Bush\'s speech and the impending international mess, it\'s probably not a good idea to go.  Sure wish I would have heard the speech, I missed it - it was just really interesting to hear everyone talk about it and what it means. This is such an insecure situation, nobody knows what will happen.  There should be no war - too many innocent, already suffering people will die.  I am speaking of the Afghani people.  Every since I noticed talk about war increasing, I have been finding myself getting more irritated and angry.

To hear people of other nations blame the U.S. for our role in eventuating the attacks offers food for thought, but I rebel at the notion that we are somehow deserving of the terror.

It may be, sadly, that I\'m getting used to mass tragedy.  I remember being far more upset by the Oklahoma City bombing in the hours and days immediately following it than I have been about this tragedy-- despite the fact that the death toll and devastation are far worse this time.  I was more upset about the Gulf War than I am about this.  These two events spring to mind because they are my previous experiences with as-it-is-happening news coverage of horror.  That surreal feeling of listening to or watching death happen, in real time, while you are safe and sound in your home, office or car reminded me immediately of those previous two events. The Murrah Building had a day care center and I had small children at the time.  My brother was active duty in the Air Force during the Gulf War and was eventually sent.  Did these tragedies affect me more because they hit closer to home, in the sense of registering somehow with my life?  I think that is part of it.  I think also, those two events and the 24/7, real time coverage was new for me.  It\'s old hat now. But what I fear is simply what I stated earlier:  I\'m getting used to this.  Yes, I felt and feel empathy with the families of the dead and missing.  I\'ve prayed daily (sometimes hourly) for them.  I especially empathized with the police, fire and ems workers in NYC. I think,though, that part of my ability to remain calm following this horror is that I know that God is in charge.  I have a deep sense of security in knowing that God is a God of justice and love.  He grieves with those families and co-workers and He can comfort them and bring meaning out of this for them in ways that I cannot.  He can also see to that justice is served.  International events are too big for me to control, but they aren\'t to big for Him! I have a kind of quiet confidence that in a God-run universe, nothing escapes His notice.  He is not a puppet master pulling our strings and forcing us to do His will (which is how hijacKing terrorists can get away with acting out the way they did).  By the same token, He has the final word in all events of human history and good will prevail because He will prevail. I don\'t know when or how He\'ll bring good out of this tragedy, I just know He will.  Because of that i\'m asking Him what, if anything, I ought to do to help.  My husband has given blood.  I\'ve been praying daily for my dear friend who was in lower Manhattan for a job interview at 9 am on Sept. 11. And simply listening to her as she processes her own trauma. So far, that and praying for wisdom for our leaders as they plan an appropriate response, seems to be what He has called me to.  But I\'m still listening...\"\"Envy, rage, misplaced religious zeal.

I am concerned for the individuals touched by this.\"It\'s not a  who,  it\'s a what -- an entire system of military manipulation and exploitaton.\"000\"I think the events of September 11th lead to a great deal uncertainty with respect to relationships across the globe. I feel concerned that the attack on the US will lead to conflict between and within countires of the world, as we have already seen attacks on muslims living in the US and the UK. Although I believe that the purpetrator of the attack should be brought to justice, I am also very aware and indeed frightened about the concequences that this may have.  I have been extremely moved by the situation and the media coverage and although I am fortunate enough not to have lost anyone that I know, it feels very \'close to home\'. It seems impossible that what would appear to be a relatively small group of people could cause mass destruction and it leaves me feeling extemely vulnerable and aware of the fragility of life.\"I have become more willing to tell those around me that I love them and am greatful to have them in my life.I am still in awe of the events of that day.  I don\'t think that even one month later it has hit me yet.  We still see images of the Towers and Pentegan as they were before everything occured.  It is hard to comprehend what it is that happened that day and how it is that we should be feeling.  I personally was extremely lucky and all the people that I knew where not hurt or lost in the destruction on that day.  I am still vrey effected by the new events unfolding each day as the sister of an elisted Airman in the United States Air Force.  Due to this I have made so incredible friends that I am constantly thinking of during this time.  I feel bad and so sorry about what happened to all those people that day but I think that they would be and should be proud to say that they were Americans and we able to live life to the fullest.  It has made me realize that things I thought were important a month ago are not so important now.  I have reconnected with those that I wasn\'t close with before.  I am hoping that with time I am able to realize the magnitude of what has occured and be thankful for what it is that I have been granted in this life.A radical faction of some group of people who blamed the United States for their current situation.because they feel that we are some kind of evil that we are sinners who need to be removed from this earth and existence.',4,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.2,1.6,0,3.2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,3.2,3.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.2,1.6,0,0,4.8,1.6,0,1.6,4.8,0,0,0,3.2,0,1.6,1.6,0,22.4,0,0.8,0,0,0,1.6,0,0,40.8,1.6,0,4.8,0,1.6,0,0,0,1.6,0,1.6,0,0,0,4.8,18.4,0,0,0,0,1.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb
'\"I am quite worried about the safety of my country.  War seems so archaic to me in the fact that I would like to believe that we are at a point where we  should be able to come to some comprimise without the loss of human life.  Revenge and retaliation do not necessarily fix the problem.       I am really trying to not take things and people for granted, although I have tried to always adapt this belief.\"I do not feel equipped to make this decision...media frenzy...terrorist groups\"That is the scary and very real concept.  SOmeone would do this for their country\'s cause and needs.

I also thought of the regret and sorrow the loved ones will feel as they recount the Tuesday morning spent with their loved ones in the daily obligations of getting ready for work..etc.  So many prayers and wishes for a re-do of that morning I\'m sure!     I am quite worried and sad about the Middle Eastern AMericans who are being treated with such hate although they are Americans as well.  It just adds to the pain and tragedy.     In many ways, it effected my days because it felt trivial taking place in my daily activities knowing my fellow Americans were buried under rubble and aching for their loved ones. \"desperate people in a foreign country where who don\'t really understand American life and whose lives Americans really don\'t understand.

I have more political discussions with my friends.  a night about a week ago I was in bed reading and suddenly I heard a plane flying overhead and it got louder and louder and sounded closer and closer and I freaked out and tried to run to my friends room right next to mine and ended up going to a nearby computer lab for company because I had a real sense that it might be a plane headed for us.  I actually thought about climbing under my desk for a moment....like bomb drills I\'d heard of.  \"well.....bewildering is the best word that I could come up with for the events.  it was surreal and horrifying and a tragedy of proportions I\'ve never experienced in close proximity or thought that I might experience.  and I guess that all of that is pretty typical.  for me, probably the strangest part--and the part that  bewildering  most describes--is the sense that all of this is far more rational than I would expect.  it is tragic and horrifying and so incredibly painful for so many people.  but I still haven\'t cried yet.  I guess that it\'s some combination of distance and confusion and the degree to which it is surreal.  but it seems like such personal pain that on some level I guess that I don\'t want to usurp the position of mourning that people actually directly (as in individual loss) affected are feeling.  its almost too much to comprehend and since the physical reality of it isn\'t looking me in the face each day I really can\'t comprehend it.....\"all I can come up with is that it must be people who are so desperate and live in circumstances that are so painful and filled with loss that they are lashing back in a way that they have become somewhat desensitized to--or that to them seems like giving a land that has incredible security a sense of what it is like to live somewhere where there is very little sense of security.  which in no way excuses what they did at all.full of fearI asked myself the very same question. I can\'t seem to find any answer that would justify such a horrific act.\"more aware of my surroundings, taking less things for granted\"0\"I think the people who are responsible are likely to be  people who harbor a deep resentment towards the mainstream beliefs and values of this country. Rather than feeling remorse, I imagine they feel as though they\'ve done a great service for their own cause. I think that we have to understand that whoever could have done this operates from a completely different framework, and at the same acknowledge that we have biases that make it particulalry  difficult to understand how the perpetrators of these acts think. I doubt we can truly understand what motivates them.\"I have experienced heightened awareness and sensitivity to my surroundings.\"Initially my reaction was one of amazement and surprise. I don\'t think the full magnitude of the event was processed until several days later, and even now (a week later)I still wonder about the implications this event  will have on our country and the world. So many issues have been brought  out by this event. Some of the issues, and more importantly the way in which they are presented by the media, concern me. In particular, I\'m concerned about how it might polarize people and increase their fear of those who are ethnically, religiously, or racially different from them. I also fear that because there is such a high level of emotionality connected to this event, that people\'s reasoning may be influenced in  negative ways that will potentially influence their behavior.  Of course, the emotional aspect of this tragedy cannot be ignored. The  people who have most directly been effected definitely need support both for their loses and also to help cope with their fears. I think this  event has shifted the collective psyche of the country and it is difficult  to speculate as to what is going to occur as a result. I think, may be it is this uncertainity and lack of control that is contibuting to the anxiety that now seems to plague us. \"\"I think that there are other people throughout the world who have systems of beliefs, norms, and values that are unlike our own, and motivate them to think and feel in ways that we cannot fully understand. I think these people must feel that the U.S. government and it\'s citizens devalue what they believe, and therefore such acts are justifiable.\"\"To imprint constant fear in the population, to weaken the country from its bases, the population\"\"I am a Venezuelan Ph.D. student in political science at the university of missouri st. louis. I have lived unstable situations such as two attempts of military coups in Venezuela and one major civilian revolt against government. I have seen people die in those battles, however what strikes me the most is not necessariy the 6.000 people that died. Of course this is the most infortunate consequence of the attacks, but it was expected in an operation like this. what strikes me the most is the vulnerability of the US and the response of government to counteract this weakness. I felt unsafe during the attacks, but know I feel worst. Just the fear that this could happen again and in greater scale, just the fear that with little effort (compaired to what the US is doing in Afganistan), extremists can put in danger inocent people with viruses such as Anthrax. I see the commitment of the US to attack and fight the battle against terrorism, but I have seen little about the commitment to secure its citizens. Just more inspections at the airports will not do this. It took one man to bomb a whole building in Oklahoma, imagine this network of extremists willing to die. the threat is inminent and I feel that this whole situation is going to have a very bad ending for the US people. \"\"Al qaeda, as a response of US international politics in the last 62 years\"I see more TV',4,-5,0,2,5,2.77,4.16,0,0,0,1.39,0,2.77,0,0,0,0,8.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.39,4.86,0,0.69,4.16,0,0,0,5.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.39,0,31.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.36,0,0,5.55,0,0,0,2.77,0,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,9.71,3.46,0,0,0,0,2.78,0,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,2.77,0,0,0.69,Female49bb

However, the way America and the UK has responded has made me very angry.  When something like this happens it is necessary to ask why it has happened and what have we done to deserve it.  America\'s response has been to see the disaster as aimed at \'democracy\', the \'civilised world\' and not to think that for one minute America\'s foreign policy could have brought it upon itself.  Furthermore, the perpetrators have been described as \'cowardly\' and \'terrorists\' and terms like rogue states have be banded about.  To kill oneself for a political cause does not seem like a cowardly act it seems like one which has been born out of persecution, poverty, powerlessness, frustration and anger.  The US government should ask if it has done anything to drive some people to feeling so desparate.  The terms terrorists and rogue states also need to be questionnaed.  Terrorists are usually defined as people doing dreadful things without the backing of democracy behind them.  Mandella was once a terrorist.  Now he is a hero.  The US is probably the biggest rogue state.  At present Bush and Blair are reacting like angry small town vigilanties who want revenge and want to be seen to be able to stand up to these type of people.  What the world need from its elected leaders is not knee jerk reactions but considered thoughful and reflective action.  Targetting muslims, afghanistan, the Talibhan will make Bush and the American victims feel better in the short term.  But it will end up with more deaths, more children, parents, etc being killed and both sides taking more revenge on each other.  I am not a pacifist and believe that when there is a simple enemy who can be targetted for the good of the majority than maybe awr is a good idea.  But having a war with unseen enemy (by the way the perpetrators are dead - that is the point of suicide attacks) just creates more victims and more \'terrorists\'.  We need to stay within the law, use the legal system and if states believe that killing people with planes is wrong the soltuion is not to kill more people with planes but to ask why they have done this, can we stop it from happening again and can we find enough evidence against the criminals to bring them to rial in front of a jury, try them and put them in prison.  As for Blai, I voted for him at the last election and feel as if he is betraying my vote.  To mindless say that he will stand shoulder to shoulder next to Bush, to say that we are his allies when every other European leader thinks Bush is an idiot seems like a gross case of misplaced sicophancy.  He is supposed to be a Christian and Christians are supposed to believe in forgiveness and understanding.  He seems to be of the old testament type going for revenge and an eye for an eye etc....... Overall, therefore I feel very sorry for the Americans and Brits whose lives have been ruined.  But I feel very angry with Bush and Blair for being so simplistic and unthinking / unreflexive in their response.... and now I feel much better!!!

I was also somewhat personally stung when I heard that one of my favorite commentators/debators, Barbara Olson, died needlessly, her plane crashing into the Pentagon.  She was a beautiful, intelligent person - as I\'ve heard about many of the others - I asked God why several times that day, why He (ultimately) took her.   And how humiliating a death - to be burned from head to toe, disfigured, or to be strewn across the pavement in unrecognizable pieces, while rescue workers collect fragments of your body in hopes of gathering DNA for identification purposes.

I am fortunate enough to feel relatively safe here in Australia (for now), but I was in Washington DC the day the attacks took place.  That day, my perspective on life - about what is important - was changed.  Today my values remain in limbo, somewhere in between my old self and a new perspective....life must go on; we must accept the reality of this imperfect existence, and continue as the person we are, with new bravery. On a broader level, I am disgusted with the potential \'grandiosity\' of the human race.  How disappointing it is to bear witness to these atrocities - brought about by the mere beliefs of other members of my species.  As humans, can we not accept our existence as biological creatures of the universe, with a unique capacity to think, be conscious, and form beliefs - that DOES indeed set us apart from other species, but DOES NOT entitle us to believe that what we \'think\' we know, is right or good?  Can we not simply be humbled by the extraordinariness of our existence here and now, enough to respect the value of our own life as well as others?  It is ironic that the very thing that sets us apart from other species, seems most likely to be that which will destroy us.  While I am not a religious person (e.g. I believe death to be the end of my being), I make no claims about the truth of my existential beliefs, nor do I expect others to necessarily hold the same views... people should obviously believe what they need to in order to get by.  Unfortunately though, it seems that this quality was lacking in the individuals who steered planes into buildings on Sept. 11.   I wonder how many more people out there think they know \'best\'?  Quite frightening.       \"To show the world that they do not respect the values of Americans? or Capitalism? or Christianity?Power Angst Hatred Relieve oppression\"When groups of people feel desparate, jealous, and angry, a collective  voice can do henious things.  In a proactive nature, we need to reach  out to others more and be less preoccupied with the material trappings  of life.  This does not have to be an organized effort, rather everyday  opportunities exist that convey a goodwill toward mankind.  Whether we  can relive the distress that less fortunate countries encounter or not,  a genuine effort can do wonders for the heart.  I think that America\'s  reaction to the 9/11 attacks prove that we have it within us, and I feel that we seem to have provided plenty of opportunity for terrorist sects  to turn the other cheek before we acted with miliatry force.

'The september 11th events were shocking to me.  Since i am mearly 18 years old this is the first event that is extremely serious that has occured during a time in my life  where i am old enough to care or understand what has been going on.

That we are not invincible\"I think that the events that took place on September 11th were a great tradgey, but I also feel that it opened our nation\'s eyes to some concerns that we should have been more concerned with ahead of time.  It is awful that so many people had to lose  their lives like this, however, I feel that our nation has been somewhat blind to the  posibilities of terroisim happening in the U.S..  We have never really ever had to deal with living with the constant fear of bombsw or land mines, such as many other countries have for years.  We have never really had a major attack on our own soil, besides Pearl Harbor.  We are somewhat oblivious to thinking that anyone would want to seek out harm on our country.  Before September 11th we were nieve about all the awful things that could be done to our nation, it is time for us to open our eyes and realize that we  are not an untouchable nation, that we too must now have to live with the fear that other nations have been dealing with for years.

'\"it is hard for many to understand that the United States are not loved by all - we think we are right in everything we do and everyone should recognize that.  I remember being in Europe in the mid-\'70s and telling people that I was Canadian because when you said you were from the United States they took a step backward - then it was because many of us were \'The Ugly American\' who spoke loudly in English to someone from a foreign country and expected everyone to defer to us.  Even with that experience, I still have trouble with the hatred we envision in some people from around the world.\"\"foreign terrorists, not US (like the Oklahoma City bombing) I would like proof that it was Osama bin Laden before the US attacks him, but I don\'t know what form that proof would take or if we could get it\"\"Even though I watched the World Trade Center collapse live on TV, it is beyond my ability to comprehend it.  On an intellectual level I believe that it happened, but emotionally it hasn\'t sunk in, probably because I don\'t have any other national event to link it to.  I do remember where I was when I heard that President Kennedy has been assassinated, and that is the closest I can come to the feelings that these attacks bring out in me.  But the true impact of that only sunk in years later.  I do believe strongly that the nation needs to get back to \'business as usual\'.  This does not mean that I do not mourn for those who died or lost loved ones, but I am determined not to change my life because that is what the terrorists want.  I will fly to Florida on October 12th, and the only concessions I will make are to get to the airport extra early and to take two books instead of one so I can keep myself busy in case of a long wait.    I have a neighbor who expressed concern over a ground war on American soil - she actually believes that there may be gun fire in our neighborhood (or at least in America).  I do not believe that will happen.  I am the mother of an 18 year old boy and I don\'t want him to go to war and I would not be happy if he were drafted, but I wouldn\'t stop him from going (i.e. sending him to Canada like during the Viet Nam War). \"not at all (except I watch CNN now)0insanityitwas an unthinkable tragedy.\"flying the flag, which I didn\'t do before.

What a terible tragedy we have had this past week.. more and more dead and missing.. lost firefighters and EMTs. Where will this all end.. when will it all end??? God Bless us all - all over the world.. all the nations that have joined in our mourning and felt the hurt and sadness we have felt here... I want to take the time to send my love and prayers to all who have lost a loved one and all the people of the nations who have joined us in how we feel about this gutless person or peoples who have done this tragic horible thing to the people here in the United States Of America... \"\"I saw it happen on tv. My first thought was, oh my God we are being attacked. 2nd thought, bin laden.  Then came shock, grief, saddness and depression. I couldn\'t cry until Sunday after. I couldn\'t leave my house for a week, I had to finally turn the tv off so that I could get back to  normal . I still feel a deep sadness for America. All those people that are still alive to deal with this. I can\'t even imagine the terror of the people in those planes. I know God took care of them. \"insanity - there is no why!!\"I have been much more aware of my feelings about things. I have a heightened sense of people around me and their sadness and fear. As of now I am getting back to normal. The fact is, we are all going to die when we are suppose to. Just make sure you know which way the light is. \"osama bin laden\"Anger, hatred, sense of injustice and being overlooked\"Reading more newspapers and watching more TV\"On the day - total shock and disbelief - it was very hard to take in.  The tv coverage of people hanging from windows and jumping just before the tower collapsed was terribly distressing, and over the next few days as people\'s individual stories of phone calls from loved ones and desperate searches for missing relatives began to emerge the  scale of the tragedy began to hit home. I didn\'t know anyone directly  affected but the stories made me cry, and feel a sense of personal loss.  As the tragedy was unfolding I felt afraid of what was going to happen  next. I felt uneasy at work in central London and went home early. There  was a strong sense of the world being united in shock and the realisation that we were seeing history unfolding. I was astonished that the US  with all their high tech weaponry could be the victim of a handful of  extremists armed with stanley knives. I have long felt that the behaviour of the US on the world stage was  arrogant, irresponsible and self-seeking. It was right for politicians  around the globe to express their deepest sorrow and condolences to the  US but I was a bit sickened to see how quickly they joined in the  language of war. I felt afraid of what the American reaction would be particularly as Bush is not noted for his intelligence, decisiveness or  compassion. I have been relieved to see that there has been no knee jerk  reaction - for any Afghan families who lose their breadwinner there  will be no pension schemes or social security benefits, just starvation. I can\'t bear to think of more hardship and sorrow being piled on these long suffering people. I do think something needs to be done - and notably for those responsible to be brought to justice - but bombing Afghanistan  seems to me to be the quickest way to ensure a new generation of terrorists. I am very apprehensive about the future - about the ease with which so much  misery can be caused and how things will progress. I have a feeling that a  bad time may be coming when the western world will start to experience  some of the fear, loss and uncertainty common elsewhere in the world.  Over the last two weeks I have often been struck with sudden grief for those  who have lost family and colleague, and fear and apprehension about the future. I have had nightmares about the tragedy which wake me up in the night. It is not in my mind all the time but creeps up unexpectedly from time to time. As someone who used to be religious but no longer believes in God, I have  missed having a religion over the last few weeks. I really want to have someone  to appeal to. I want to invoke some power to help world leaders make the right  decisions over the coming weeks and months, because I really don\'t  know where the West should go from here.  \"1)The terrorists - they have to be ultimately responsible for such a brutal act 2)The US government - for needing such a wake up call to the resentment they have caused 3)Whoever thought it was a good idea to build towers so high they can\'t be evacuated in a fire 4) The western world - we are so complacent',4,-5,0,2,5,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.25,0,0,1.42,0,21.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.13,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,2.84,7.8,0,0,4.25,0,0,0,7.09,0,0,0,0.71,1.42,0,2.13,0,53.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64.51,4.25,0,5.67,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,8.51,11.35,8.5,1.42,0,0,4.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,Female49bb
'\"Irritation over the lack of equality due to tensions between 2 ancient peoples, the Arabs and the Jews  WHO KNOW BETTER but play on emotional sentiment rather than reason with each other\"\"I lost six friends in the 911 attacks, 3 in World Trade #2, and 3 at the Pentagon. I totally support the military intervention by the US in Afghanistan, and would support any collateral interventions in neighboring countries. But I want a real intervention this time, not another Somalia... It is difficult to discuss the anthrax problems and the hatred towards the United States with my students, yet a sense of trust has really bonded me to most of the kids. They realize I will tell them when to worry. I am worried that the actions by the terrorists so far is just a throat clearing, the tip of the iceberg...that they have many more targets and are just waiting for things to slow down. I do not trust the Taliban at all. I am a woman, and a damn smart one. I would castrate any man who tried to make me hide under an oat sack. The women should kick the Taliban in the balls, and walk away. No one is better than me, no one. I totally trust President Bush and am so glad he is in the White House. Gore would bore us to death with excuses. He never had the guts to really speak his mind. ANd his military record as a photo jopurnalist did not make him a soldier. The Black guys who were on the front lines were the heros of Viet Name (I am not Black, by the way). This is one of those moments like when I sae President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy and Martin L King killed, the Challenger explode, and the first man walk on the Moon... Now is the time to quit yapping and start working for real global unity, not a time to hide behind the Global is bad sign. Get a life, it is so short...cherish it!\"I am more aware of my surroundings and I listen more carefully to what people are saying.\"al Qaida and the Taliban, with guidance from Osama bin Laden and the radical mullahs of the Arab World\"A small faction of extremely radical Muslims. I would describe them as cult like.\"Genuine belief(however misguided) that the US wants to destroy all Muslims and Muslim nations and wipe out Islam. I also think, underlying all of this reotoric is a desire to overthrow the Monarchies of the rich oil states.\"Trying to listen to God more and more.\"We (my husband and I) have been concerned for years about the lax security with air travel in the US.  Being Americans that have lived abroad for years, we have noticed that the difference between security in international travel and US domestic has been striking. This was a huge wake-up call about the level of fanatic hatred that certain small groups of radical Muslims have for the US. This has been building up for a long time.  It is too bad that America had to learn this at such a huge cost. As for my feelings on a deeper level, this was a horrifying, tragic and and very sad day for me, as an American.  I felt that very personally. To have our country attacked so brutally, using our own domestic planes as  vehicles of mass destruction, in such a  showy  way was almost more than I could bear. At first,the huge human lose and suffering was so shocking and sad, I would cry everytime those that were missing loved ones would come on tv with a picture and description of the missing....so determined and sure they would be found.  This still brings me to tears recalling it. Seeing the events over and over on tv I felt as if the perpetrators had reduced us to the level of a violent video game (planes crashing into prominent buildings which were reduced to rubble). This was hurtful and demeaning as well as horrific. I also felt violated because this happened on our own soil. Now, I have an underlying feeling of fear about the future on many levels.  Living in Saudi Arabia, we have such a sense of uncertainty right now.  Our offices were blown up in \'95 by 4 young Saudis who had spent lots of time in Afganistan with the then freedom fighters. How many other like them are here now?  What will be the repucussions in the region, if US military strikes begin? That could go so many ways. My fears for home, in American, are that the terrorism will continue and escalate over a long period of time and take on many forms.  It is so difficult to say how all of this will go now.  However, I continue to place my trust in God, the only answer to getting through all of this mess. I pray that our leaders stay focused on that, too.   On a positive note, I am so proud and amazed at what a unifying effect this has had on our nation....and so immediately. It has been astounding.  My hope is that this will be sustained.  We have come to be a people of  instant gratification  and I hope America doesn\'t just get bored with this like yesterday\'s news.  This is not going away quickly.  Note to Jamie: thanks for the opportunity to write about this.  I just sat down and started writing...had no idea I\'d have so much to say. William may get a chance to respond, as well, on the weekend.      \"\"The attacks on our nation, the nation that I have forever been told that I am safe in, has taken me by shock.  Not just in the literal sense, but in every possible physical sense of the word.  I have many friends and realtives who work in or around the WTC and I have never spent a day glued to the TV/phone/computer trying to get in touch with so many people just to make sure tha they are OK.  This was something new to me and everyday I pray that they are surviving and trying to continue on with their lives.  The event changed my life forever, I now talk to more than 20 people a day, long distance just to tell them that I love them and I am thinking about them, and I make an effort to recognize how such a little action from me may change someone\'s feelings for the rest of the day.  I smile more, thank people more, and I tell myself that I must make the best of this day because we never know.  BUT, I DO NOT live in fear for I will not allow these terrorists to get their wish.\"\"Because fanatics see only their thoughts and beliefs and will not accept that there are others who do not agree with them and therefore must go about doing acts of hatred to try and prove to themselves that they are superior,....how ironic\"I can only go by what I have been told:  Terrorists groups led by Osama bin Laden0\"I fear the knee-jerk reaction of so many here, including our President, who say we should go fight, get even, or prove that  they can\'t get away with it.   The US is a very powerful nation.  If we substitute the image of the US as that of a big, strong, and influential person, one with powerful weapons and deeply held convictions, that person would be scary to almost everyone else, no matter how benevolent the person was.     The US needs to carefully evaluate the affect of its actions and attitudes on the economies, the governments, and the people of other nations. We may not be completely innocent, we may not be the benevolent force for only good that we would like to be.  We may sometimes take the side of another nation even when they are not being just to others.  We take resources from other nations to support our extravagent lifestyles, and we encourage other nations to allow our capitalistic endeavors to invade their lands.  We allow our businesses to introduce cigarettes and other unhealthy goods. And we build up our borders to keep people out.  Much of our rescource use is unsustainable, and our practices are not sound or healthy for those nations and peoples.    This is not to excuse the terrorists or the act.  Certainly whomever is responsible must be prevented from doing anything more, and other terrorists must be prevented from targeting us or any other nation or group.  I fear their use of chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons. This is not the way to solve conflicts, whether they are political, social, religious, or ideological. But as the most powerful nation, the US has a special responsiblity to make sure that our actions do not either unintentionally or carelessly harm others.  Escalating the violence, especially without careful consideration, and an evaluaton of our own culpability, is also not the way to solve conflicts.    I do see some good coming from this. People are banding together more and seeking internal harmony.  At least our internal racial, political, ideological, and some religious and cultural differences seem to be becoming less of an obstacle to finding solutions.\"\"Directly, probably Osama bin Laden; indirectly, many people and organizations, perhaps even to a certain extent, ourselves.\"\"I feel more pride in the US and its people, and more fear of unknown people of middle-eastern cultures.

'I don\'t think we can pin it on one person.  Surely the people who actually hijacked the planes.  The  higher ups  who planned the events.  The people who funded it. And whoever dreamed it up in the first place.  \"If a person truly believed that another country was threatening his or her own way of life, that might explain why.

I spent most of last week in crisis response mode -- tending to my students and to other faculty and shoving my own emotions down for the most part (this is my normal response to a crisis -- do what needs to be done now and fall apart later).  I\'m starting to move to the  fall apart later  stage now.  I\'m OK at work, but when I get home I find that I cry easily, yet I am also drawn to MSNBC and other coverage of the ongoing event.  I\'m finding myself especially moved by the  personal stories of the victims and survivors.  The story of the  passengers aboard Flight 93 who overpowered the hijackers in order to save lives on the ground has been something that I\'ve held onto. I was so disappointed last Thursday (?) when the story of the 5 firefighters who were rescued from the WTC rubble turned out to be false. Last night, I was reading Time magazine and listening to Bush\'s speech to the 2 houses, when I finally started to cry and then said  Enough.  I want all the buildings back.  I want the people back.  I want the families and friends reunited.  I want the world back the  way it was.   A total 4-year-old response, but it\'s how I feel.  I don\'t want to go to war.  I don\'t want vengeance.  I don\'t want to kill any innocent people.  Bring the guilty to justice, but do it using good old fashioned police work, just like was done for Milosevic.

I don\'t know anyone that was injured or killed in the attack, but it was if it were my own family.  I\'m an American, but have lived outside of the States for most of the past 14 years.  I\'ve felt the dislike and disapproval of people from many other countries towards ours and I\'ve always tried to be open-minded about what they say.  There have been times when I\'ve wondered what\'s gone wrong with our society, when you hear so many stories of crime on the news, etc. but never have I understood our society nor been more proud to be an American than I am now, after the attacks.  People from Socialist countries think our government is cruel because they don\'t force us to pay more taxes in order to have more social benefits for those less fortunate and I\'ve come to realize that we don\'t need the government to tell us what to do with our money.  So many people have donated their money as well as their time, blood, food, clothes... you name it, it\'s been donated by Americans.

It was different than what I expected when it happened, because I had heard stories of rebuilding Europe after WW2, I thought the community would come together and we would throw bricks around like in the soviet propaganda posters, but in actuality I was completely \'unskilled\' and could be of no help in an effort that was conducted by large machinery and construction workers.

This is  guerilla warfare as its worst and it\'s going to take a very long time to track these people down. Attacking Afghanistan is also tricky--ask the Soviets. This is the first time that civilians have been attacked from an enemy  outside since the Revolutionary War. It is frightening and I don\'t  believe society here will ever be the same. One good thing:  the response has brought people here into co-operative communities.  People are reaching out in love and helpfulness. One bad thing:  We have our own rightist groups here and innocent US Moslems are feeling the backlash. It was touching to see the worldwide response of our allies.

At first it did not even seem real to me.  I felt extremely sad.  Although I did not know anyone personally who was injured or killed, I mourned as if I did.  I was very sad for several days and it was difficult to have a sense of humor.  I really felt sick to my stomach.  \"\"Perhaps the 60\'s were the end of the innocence for the United States. But September 11th was the end of the age of naivet .  It was bound to happen. After the Cold War, previously concentrated pockets of both arms and organization, were dispersed. We carried on. War was raging in different parts of the world, wealth coming into the hands of those, (quite frankly, I think) with not much to do, common opportunists emerging with a chance for power by solely calling out  down with America! . We carried on. Our films and TV shows and pictures of  America  as a land of Baywatch beautiful, 90210 rich, Nordic Track healthy, FRIENDS happy people  - anathema to those poor, ravaged and prayerful. While others suffered, they must of thought (their governments neglecting to mention the money and services we give them), that we were a garden of Godless children dancing about, smiling and exchanging spouses.  What a perfect image to hate and use as a rallying effigy! So rather than turn their energies to making their lives better by demanding more from their religious and business leaders and government   they turned outward ------ not unlike the child that is teased or worse: ignored, at school   spending his nights thinking  Ill show them    only to show up at school one day, militant, judging, insane with jealousy and misfitness   shooting the archetypes of beauty and happiness.  But just as turning into a murderer doesn t give the weak power   doesn t gain the unloved respect   and only serves to further the chasm between they and  them  ---- so did this.  Yes, I was shocked. To the core. But then I thought of the bombing of London. Of Europe whose nights, for years, were filled with bombs, fire and death. I thought of the movies that I saw, (I m 30), where women were with their families during a raid, in the Underground, knitting!, dust falling on them as the city above was shaken with bombs   with their stiff upper lips   faith in Divine Providence   and sheer British grit. That s how we shall be. We carry on, as well, you see. As ethnocentric as it sounds   there is a reason we lead the world. Its not because we have never been bombed (until last week) or fought on our own shores a foreign enemy. Its is because we are Saxon and Germanic at our core. Fearless and organized. Relentless. We have a greater spirit than these poor idiots that blame us for their own shortcomings. We carry on. We rebuild   and we are brilliant at using such as has happened to make us better, stronger, richer. It is our collective sense of noblesse oblige that made us give monies and support to all those countries (137 million to Afghanistan this year alone!!!!!)   but now. Bite me. We won t be as magnanimous to enemies. But we shall be twice as kind to their enemies! A great mistake has been made. I cried the first few days. Almost non-stop. But in the name of those martyrs   we carry on. And my generation will now prove to its grandfathers that we are made of the same stuff. Do I want revenge? Yes. I was pro-life (I m Catholic) prior to Tuesday. That has changed. It seems that murder is part of this human game. So fine. Better they than us.  And just like intelligent enemies of great culture, organization and spirit could not defeat u s- nor will these cowards who don t even have the balls to claim their work.  We carry on. \"Jealousy combined with depression and a sense of futility and desperate need to feel  important Im a bit more hostile when I see Arabs or Middle Easterners.

Otherwise they haven\'t changed much.\"\"Because they hate us.  They hate what the USA stands for--exploitation, wealth at any cost to others, theft of natural resources from around the world.  They also have a deep belief in a very fundamentalist faith that reveres a more puritanical world with no major corporate monopolies that spread USA culture to the rest of the world etc.  \"\"I am very upset about the attacks, but even moreso by the response to the attacks.  Our country is reponding in a way that will solidify the world against us and will leave the children of this country without safety.  We are all at greater risk now.  And I cannot help but feel frustrated b/c this all is happening b/c some fanatic people are angry at us for our terrible foreign policy in the Middle East.  If we had worked harder to help create a free and sovereign Palestinian state and had not abandoned Afganistan after the Russsians left, these attacks may never have happened.  We are to blame in part for this whole thing and until we take the responsibility to look at our own behavior in the world (should I say the behavior of our gov\'t) we will never be able to disarm attacks like these.  By bombing Afganistan we are making thousands of young adolescent Arab/Middle Eastern men into terrorists--we make the world a more dangerous place.  Our best approach now would be to strive to create peace in Israel/Palestine, to stop bombing and help Afgani people who have fled their country with food, shelter, and medicine.  To provide resources for Afganistan to build free schools, roads, infrastructure that can be used to enhance the livelihoods of the Afgani people.  Then, and only then, they might believe that we are NOT the monster bin Laden has made us out to be. Then, and only then, they might find a way to work toward constructive change and show an intolerance for bin Laden and his gang of terrorists.  We need to model to the world our strength as a peaceful country, our ability to help build bridges between differing views, our committment to making the world a peaceful, safe, and free place for all people, not just for the richest 0.5\% of the world.   \"\"Both the terrorists (bin Laden, maybe Iraq, and others) and the USA who trained and supported them for years!\"',3,-5,0,2,5,2.84,4.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,12.07,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.26,0,0,2.13,1.42,4.26,0,0,5.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,47.57,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,4.26,0,55.38,5.68,0,1.42,0,1.42,0,0,0,5.68,0,0,0,0,0,22.72,7.81,1.42,0.71,1.42,0,11.36,0,0,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.55,Female49bb

Thus, the GROUP associated with Osama bin Laden.\"Because they believe that the US is or represents \'evil\' and that they are responsible for eradicating evil.\"Fear.  Uncertainty. I have not been able to focus my thoughts since then. I\'m behind in my work. I go to sleep and wake up thinking about the people in the WTC. I don\'t really want to visit the US, but I have not changed my plans to do so. One cannot live fearing what \'might\' happen.  One has to keep on.  Life is scary now. The US is indeed ego-centric.  That does not make Americans \'wrong\' or deserving of the attacks. I have no answer.   The attackers seem to be better organised, financed, focused, and possibly even courageous than \'Western governments\', those whom I expect to protect me. And that\'s scary.\"\"When I first turned on the TV after the first plane had it, I was horrified  that such an accident could occur. My husband is a commerical airline pilot and it hit very close to home. Every commercial crash upsets me a great deal. When I saw the second plane hit, and the reality of what was happening dawned on me, I was first devasted at the loss of life and horror of this intentional act,  and then scared that this would continue. We really thought that this would continue to happen all over the country. We were concerned about friends we know who fly those aircraft and tried to get in touch with them, to no avail. It was one of the most scary moments of my life. I thought that it was the beginning of WW3. I knew that things would never be the same again. I thought we were going to die. And as the events unfolded, I faced mortality. I really thought that by the end of the day, we\'d all be dead. For the first month after the attack, I was glued to the TV, radio, online news. I wanted to know everything there was to know. And then, I couldn\'t take any more. I was tired of crying all the time. I was tired of nightmares every night. I was tired of avoiding standing by windows in case a plane came crashing through them.  Now, 5 months after the attack, the nightmares have stopped. But I still cry at any coverage of the events, or talk of the losses. Any time an ambulence or fire truck goes by I burst into tears. Every morning, I look out of the window an look for signs of smoke or some catastrophe. I turn on the news first thing in the morning  now, to make sure nothing else terrible has happened. I\'m not afraid all the time like I was, but I\'m just waiting for something catastrophic to happen. It\'s a horrible feeling.\"\"Live each day at a time and try to make the most of every day.

It brought back memories and uncomfortable feelings associated with previous disastorous events I have been involved with (Pan Am flight 103, the explosion of Chernobyl).  I have been praying a lot, and feel sad and concerned about the world we are leaving to our children. I am still somewhat in shock and in awe and disbelief as well. My life has chnaged very little yet, but I know that it will no doubt change profoundly in the future. I feel very old for the first time in my life.  \"I don\'t know\"I have been totally confused about this whole thing happening.  I am on an emotional rollercoaster right now, with no end in sight.   When I got the news at work that this happened, I was shocked and didn\'t really realize how terrible it really was (we don\'t have a TV at work).  I spoke with my Mother and she told me how bad it was.  I was unable to get to MSNBC.com or any other news website do to internet traffic.  I began getting anxious.   I could not focus on work, I ended up having to go home.  Then I saw it and broke down.   I do not know anyone that worked in the WTC or the Pentagon, nor did I know anyone that was on any of the flights, but I was very hurt and sad.   I don\'t know if what should be done.  I am very afraid of a war turning into a bigger war into an even bigger war.  I never thought I would see something like this happen in my lifetime.  I feel like I have been being sheltered my whole life living in the greatest country...the country that has the strongest government, armed forces and freedom to live.  I feel like I have been sheltered because I have never had to see such a tragedy so close to home. I saw the Gulf War, but I don\'t think that was a war by any means.  I think the worst is yet to come. I am scared and hurt...but scared more than anything.  I am afraid nothing is going to be the same ever again.  I have a brother in the reserves and I am afraid for him too.  I don\'t want him to go through this. It makes me happy to see so many people coming together and showing their patriotism.  It is too bad it took this to make that happen. I don\'t know how I should feel.  I feel crazy for being so emotional. I am so confused.\"\"I am anxious, keep asking myself if this was all a dream, on edge.  I have been trying to work extra hours to stay away from the news.\"I don\'t knowI don\'t know.  Hatred.  Money.  Publicity.I am still not sure.I think they have been brain washedI have been devastated by this terrorist act. I know I have been sheltered all my life and lulled into a false sense of security. I fear what is to come. I have not put my life on hold. I am continuing my life but there  is a  definite cloud hanging over me. I have done a lot of reflecting and I have had a very good life full of love from familiy and friends. I went through therapy a few years ago and I remember talking about shame. How some acts are shameful and committed by people who have no shame. I think this is the case here. These people have obviously never had love in their lives. I can\'t imagine living like that. Not having anything to  live for. What is the point? I live on the West coast.

New Yorkers will forever be hurt and bruised.  we will never forget this.  but what hurt me the most was when i saw the people jump out the window and when i saw the buuilding crumble.  you will never think something like this would happen to us but it did.\"some humans somewhereThey must have really believed it was the right thing to do.\"I spend a lot more time just sitting and thinking.  I now go down to the river to get work done and take some time to see the beauty there.  I spend a lot more time talking about war and peace.  Since 9/11, I have spent a lot of  time on the phone with friends, first checking if they were still alive, then checking if they were emotionally ok, then trying to help them, b/c most of them are not emotionally ok.\"\" My little sister lost one of her closest friends. They\'d had an argument a  while ago and hadn\'t made up yet.  He\'s still  missing , not confirmed  dead, so his whole family wakes up each morning and spends the day  going from hospital to hospital looking for him.  Her other friend,  (the three of them are/were sort of a friendship triad) is staying at  the missing person\'s apartment b/c if he comes home someone should be  there.  He\'s not coming home. My sister can\'t reach the family, b/c  they have no phone lines.  She thinks they won\'t want to see her  b/c they might know that she and their son had had a fight.  I\'m  worried about her. That\'s just one cell.  Probably not covered on the news.  There are thousands of those cells. I have spent the last week calling people in NYC, in the area, who might have been in the area.  I find now that I am afraid to return a call I received  a few days ago from  someone I haven\'t talked to in several years.   I\'m afraid of why she is calling.  Just to see if I\'m ok?  Or to tell  me someone is dead?   I keep remembering people I haven\'t called yet. Now I\'m also worried about  people who I know are of Middle Eastern decent.  I should be working  on a huge project I have due and I have been, but is that any excuse  for not seeing if the people I care about are ok after something like  this?   And then I think.  Wow, I\'m doing a great job of making this about  me when it isn\'t.  Still, many things that seemed very important two  weeks ago, seem less urgent now. My 9 year old nephew thinks armed men are going to take over his  home and kill his family.  I\'m trying to figure out what to say to him  when he calls.  I do know that this is nothing new.  Man\'s inhumanity to man and all that.   I never wonder to see men wicked, but I often wonder to see  them not ashamed.    Remember us, if at all, not as lost violent  souls, but only as the hollow men, the stuffed men  etc etc etc.  But  then again, it has always made me upset.  I also figure that to the extent that there is some sort of balance in nature, then if humans  are capable of creating great beauty and having such immense compassion,  then it follows that they must also be capable of horror, destruction,  and cruelty.  But, I think I might give up the former if it would get  rid of the latter.  Of course, no one has given me that option, and  besides, I\'m still not so sure that the true force is balance and  not chaos anyway. I do love America.  I don\'t know how proud I am specifically to be  American or human.  But I don\'t think this is a time for  Americans  to  band together (aside from the fact that people in the U.S. aren\'t forming bonds with most American\'s anyway, b/c many American\'s are Canadian, Mexican, Central American, and South American).  But a time for us to see the  horror against humanity that has occurred.  And it is not a time for  us to bomb another country or send 18 year old boys off to their deaths,  but a time for us to heal ourselves and shun violence against our fellow men. I find that I seem to have a most unpopular opinion about this.  I have  had several arguments with close friends over this.  Have decided maybe it\'s not a good topic.  Last thing I want is for this event to create  anger between me and my friends.  I\'ve seen a lot of people fighting  more.  Cars pulled over with drivers screaming at each other.  Is that how we respond to violence against us, by being violent to each other? Mostly, I\'ve been terribly disappointed in the response to this tragedy. Mostly I find that I don\'t understand.  Is it easier to be angry than  to feel immense sorrow?  Maybe.   I still just feel the sorrow.  And I have also been able to see some  beauty come from that sorrow.  My sister may have actually have found  a way out of a lifetime of depression, due to reflecting on this  event - ironic I suppose.  Another friend of mine just gave birth to  her second child yesterday.  So, amid all the death, there are still  new beginnings.  And, I have found people here and there who remember  why peace was such an important idea at one point. But, when the 18-year old sales kid at a store where I was recently shopping told me that he was in the reserves and he hoped we went to war so he could fight, all I could think of was,  Oh, it would be so sad if you had to die too.   I didn\'t say anything.  He was young and he didn\'t know what dying was, or how horrible killing can really be.\"I\'ve been watching a lot  more TV and listening a lot more to the radio.  We don\'t know yet.  We may never know -- something we\'ll have to find a way to deal with emotionally.  \"Obviously, this was a distressing and horrifying event.   What bothers me most about it is that real human beings--people with unique lives and beliefs and projects and plans--were turned into symbols.  No human should ever be reduced to a symbol of anything: good, evil, capitalism, imperialism, whatever.  Turning human beings into symbols strips them of their humanity and turns them into the pawns of ideology...and we now see the violent potential in the simplistic impulse to symbolize.    The terrorists apparently thought they were attacking  America  -- an abstraction that one can take (sometimes violent) ideological issue with. In actual fact, they attacked and killed approximately 6000 human beings who happened to inhabit space in the landmass we\'ve agreed to call the  United States of America.  As I write this, I\'m listening to NPR\'s broadcasting of stories of the people who were killed or are missing -- what they did for a living, who their children and families are, what kind of people they were.  These people are symbols of nothing -- they were real people with real lives.  And their murder is a crime because they were PEOPLE, not because they were  Americans.   We as a group of people who occupy  America  are at a crossroads.  We now have the opportunity to set a different precedent--the precedent of insisting that we stop treating real  human beings as symbols.  We must dissent against the impulse to do this:  to characterize entire groups of people as  good  or  evil.   Without a doubt, certain individuals are guilty of criminal actions in this case:  murder.  These people must be found and brought to justice in a world tribunal.  War will not accomplish this objective; rather, it will allow us to turn human beings (many of whom are innocent) into symbols of  evil  that we can then  righteously  destroy.    Real people always have one tool that symbols lack  -- they can talk to one another.  They can engage in rational discourse with one another to attempt to find ways to solve their problems.  All people who have stakes in this issue (which may be every human being currently alive on this planet) should be regarded as having both the right and the obligation to engage in this rational discourse.  Terrorist acts are monstrous because they circumvent this process of rational discourse...and in the process, strip people of their humanity.  We must not succumb to the simplistic impulse -- however emotionally satisfying it might be -- to dehumanize other people by silencing their voices.  \"\"Because they believe that symbolic acts against material entities (people, buildings) that they are treating as symbols can in some way address issues of perceived injustice.\"I think all of humanity is responsible because we are a violent species.\"I am deeply saddened that this is the way in which humanity chooses to solve its arguments.  There is no excuse for such a horrific act.  I am further saddened by the way the people of the US are responding to this event.  I look at the news on television, and people are very drawn in by the President\'s cowboy mentality.  I just don\'t know what will make the US different from the terrorists if we go in and bomb civilians who have the misfortune of residing in the same country as bin Laden and his group.  War or acts of war are never without loss to someone.  I feel that all life is valuable-- everyone is, after all, someone\'s child.  I find it extremely disconcerting that people are so ready to seek revenge, particularly in a physical sense (as opposed to finding the parties and putting them on trial in the court of a neutral third party, so that the true facts of the case may be examined rather than outrage and emotion controling the proceedings).  Nobody, to my knowledge, has bothered to discuss the sociological or psychological aspects about why people committ terroristic acts.  The US has been pumping money and weapons into Israel for a long time.  Perhaps the Muslims in the Middle Eastern region felt outmatched, and unheard by the world at large.  Resorting to terrorism seems like an adaptive trait in that case.  Now, if I were to say that out loud people would not understand due in large part to the mob mentality of  justice.   Believe me, what was done was just horrible, and I in no way support that act, nor any other terrorist act.  I guess I just wish I lived in a world in which those types of things wouldn\'t even happen.  The US is a good place to live, comparitively; however we are not the  heroes  that we like to tell ourselves we are.  We intervene where/whenever there are US interests being threatened-- not because we\'re the  good guys.   That idea is a misconception lost on the vast majority of citizens.  Until humans can learn to be civilized with each other, what\'s the point of getting *really* upset about anything?  If we strike, if they strike, it\'s still someone child who is dead at the end of the day.  And nobody wins when that happens.  I wish you the best on this project.\"To make a point which went unheard prior to this (perhaps).  Or perhaps because organized religion is full of blind dogma which demands the individual be unthinking.  Or perhaps because humans are innately violent and destructive.  And then there\'s always good old hatred.\"I\'ve found myself talking/engaging less with people.  I don\'t want to hear about how we need to  go over there and kill them all.   On a more pragmatic note I\'ve found myself becoming mesmorized by aircraft overhead, particularly when out running at night.  I keep wondering if I\'m seeing the plane\'s headlights because it\'s pointed downward and heading toward my area.  I\'ve also made a firm decision to not fly again.  \"I don\'t understand why someone would take out their own anger in this way.It has not.Osama Bin Laden\'s terrorist group (ie I believe what I am told by the press about resposibility.)\"I was not surprised that the World Trade Centre was the victim of terrorism, it provoked because: of where it is its name what it represents Also, it had been attacked before. I was very surprised by the method of the attack.  I cannot understand the mentality of people who will follow a leader as far as to commit suicide. The horror of people knowing they were going to die and the way they died after the attack is something I think about several times each day. I think the event has brought people\'s attention more to the problems in the Middle East, which is good. I am much more aware, as a result of press comment, of possible future terrorism and of the importance of good  intelligence . I am pleased that people, like me, are horrified by the possibility of civilan deaths as a result of any retaliation. \"',4,-4,0,2,5,0.43,4.31,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,1.29,0,8.61,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,1.29,0,4.73,2.58,0,0,6.89,0,0,0,6.89,0,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,34,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.16,1.72,0,7.32,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.89,5.16,0,1.29,0,0,1.72,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0.86,0.86,Female49bb
'\"Because they are desperately disenfranchised, and in fear for their lives while others ignore their deep needs\"I cry more often.  I am careful who I talk to about my pacifist feelings.  I make a special effort to be friendly to anybody with dark skin.  I have given money to relief efforts.  I have attended meetings on this topic.  I have been talking to my son about war and terrorism.  I watch and listen to the news more frequently.  I have been in touch with distant friends more regularly.  I am sleeping less.  I have begun a meditation/prayer practice.\"The US and other superpowers of the past, and the politics of power and profit that put money and power before the basic needs of fellow human beings.  It is obviously more complicated than that, but I think this is a big part of it.\"\"I am deeply distressed about the awful thing that has happened to so many human beings. I lived in New York for 13 years, so the events of September 11 seem pretty close to me.  I have a lot of family there, none of whom were harmed, but I may never know the fate of the many aquaintences I had there, but lost track of when I moved away. Now, a week after the tragedy, my thoughts are about the destruction my own country is preparing to unleash on more innocent people.  I am already grieving the losses that are yet to come.  I can\'t see that their losses are any different than ours.  We all have soft, vulnerable bodies and we all make strong attachments to each other. I don\'t understand how we can maintain the myths that Americans are blameless in this and that more killing will help anything in any way.  Can\'t we learn from previous experience and do something different than the maneuvers that brought us to this point? I resent suddenly finding myself in the position of being part of a very small minority (pacifists) that others perceive as dangerous.  I feel that I have to be careful about who I talk to about these feelings that overwhelm me.  I feel that stopping this war is an overwhelming and probably impossible task, and I don\'t know how I will find the time to do what needs to be done.  I am angry at the media that is ignoring the peace movement, and trying to stir up feelings in favor of going to war. \"Middle Eastern terrorist and American policies and lack of security procedures0Anger over American policy\"Avoid crowds when I can, more emotionally shut down, anger that people in other parts of US don\'t understand the fears we have in NY and DC, feeling more hopeless\"\"I\'m located in Hoboken, NJ, just accross the river from NYC, and life feels so different now.  My first reaction to the attacks was unmitigated terror, since my niece worked in one of the towers (she\'s fine), and in the midst of that terror I cursed this planet we live on and any God who could arrange a world that you ca\'t get out of alive, and can\'t have input into how much those you love are going to suffer in life.  The terror clung, especially when I had to cross the rivr to go into New York.  It felt like playing Russian roulette...would they go after the bridge, the ferries, the path trains or the lincoln tunnel?  it was a terrible decision to make every time.  I\'ve noticed that people who have to go in everyday have become fatalistic in their attitudes, which I\'m sure is necessary, but I still have the luxury, at least, of getting scared only on the occasions I have to go into the city.  The terror of possible bioterrorism has rocked me a few times as well.  Even the thought of car bombs lingers for me, as we\'re so close to the lincoln tunnel, the Holland tunnel, Patterson and Jersey city (where some of the terrorists made their homes).     On the other hand, I feel like i\'m in a place far beyond rage.  It\'s impossible to lose your neighbors and witness so much devestation up close and still think that doing this to someone else might help anything.  I don\'t understand the people who were willing to die and kill others, just like I don\'t understand the high school kids who go on rampages, but I believe they are acting out of fear and pain.     And I think, If we can keep our thoughts from being ruled by our fear, that we may have an opportunity here to remake the world, to become one family.  On a personal level, I\'m fighting my own impulses to scan the faces that are boarding the subway or ferry with me, and trying to meet everyone\'s eyes with a smile to remind them that we are in this together, in a kind of global embrace.   My dreams are so very busy these nights, as if I\'m trying to learn or remember something important, to add to this critical time of choosing how the new world is going to be.\"\"they say the evidence points to Bin Laden, and I believe them, but I would guess Iraq is involved, too.\"\"I\'m very wary, I pay much more attention to my surroundings, I keep in closer  contact with my family, I try to be kinder to everyone who\'s path I cross, and I\'m more patient in traffic and waiting in lines.\"\"Because religion can create fanaticism, and because the USA\'s own CIA has acted almost as a terrorist organization in the intersts of our own business interests for years, at great cost to smaller nations.\"\"When the first attack took place I thought something really strange was going on for a plane to hit the world trade center.  When the second plane hit the world trade center I thought it was the end of the world and something had happened to the navigation instruments.  Then the second thought was it is our enemy.  It was just so unbelievable that this was happening in NY city.  Then the Pentagon was more so.   I began to wonder how many other bldgs would be hit? At first I was so angry that I wanted to go in and bomb the Taliban just for there support of Bin Laden.  Now I still want to get them and some of the other leaders including the leader and mad man in Iraq.   I feel like our government is so helpless in this new kind of war.  What can we accomplish with the culture and ethics these people grew up with?  I also know from hearing professors speaking that many educated and common people in that area of the world hate Americans and everything we stand for.  Where can we go for a trustworthy leader that leads the middle East.  I am skeptical abt most of the ones that claim to be on our side.   I hate to see the young men that come in to the warehouse  (we are in Odessa, TX and sell to the oilfield supply stores) and say they have joined or rejoined the armed services.  I can\'t believe this war can be won by the loss of lives like WWII.   To me these young men are going to endure much and gain little.  The frustration of it all makes me sick and angry.     I am still feeling very frustrated and get angry at the reporters asking strategic questions that could mean life and death to those involved.  Such as when are we going to strike and how?  Oh yes, lets publicize that info!! I have lost sleep watching the events on TV desperately hoping they would find real live people in that awful Ground Zero.  I hate those people that did this so much and wish they had lived so we could torture them and make them feel all the fear and lost they cost us. My heart bleeds for those expecting love ones to be found who were in the WTC.  It is so hard to lose a loved one but the expectation of finding that person walking around the city with memory lose keeps these people   where they can\'t let go and began healing. This attack has changed America forever.  Along with it went our freedoms.  Our sense of security living our everyday life.  We lost so much and i am afraid we will lose so much more before it all ends. God be with our leaders.  God be with there leaders and show them the right way for all mankind. \"The teachings of a fanatic religious culture and the teaching of there leaders to hate America.I think Sadam is involved and Bin Laden but many others that are in that part of the world and believe that kind of religious fanaticism.  Talaban should be cut and poured salt on.\"I don\'t seem to have as much energy, losing sleep, watching TV waiting to see what is going to happen next as they say waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I hesitate to ask my children who are 21 and 27 to fly up so we can be together for Christmas.  I know everything is going to change drastically and it literally makes me sick to imagine how.  I am working but my mind always goes back to the attacks and the results.\"\"All I truly remember is that I was standing in the University Center at my school trying to add into a new class, and as I was looking around people were gathered around two televisions, which I thought was odd because there usually isn\'t t.v.\'s out in the open like that.  I had a few minutes to spare so I decided I\'d check it out.  After watching the news for a bit, i still had no idea what was going on-along with some newcomers beside me. so we asked.  They told me the WTC had been hit, ETC. (don\'t want to go into it) It did not affect me at all during the day.  I knew what happened, yet the actuality of the entire event was so unfathomable, so unbelievable, that I didn\'t really believe it.  I went on with my day, until later I went on my computer to watch the news since we don\'t get cable.  But because I went online I could pick and choose what I wanted to watch. I figured I would just watch the initial attack and the news that covered it.  It wasn\'t so easy.  I\'m not sure when I started to watch, but I know that it was approximantly 1:00 am when i finished watching everything that I could possibly handle.  I was on the verge of tears after about 5 minutes. Even after I stopped watching it, it was on my mind when I went to bed.  My Best Friends Father and Mother were both born in NY.  Her Dad was getting remarried on the 15th. None of his family could make it to his wedding.  The entire time I was there, I couldn\'t stop thinking about how different the entire thing would have been...it was sobering.  Like here we are having a good time, or at least trying to have a good time, when all these people...you know. Any time I think about it I start to cry, but the stories of the people on the t.v., those are the worst. Hearing about the people who are missing in this disaster, I start to sob. Its emotionally distracting. How can I concentrate when this stuff happening across the country?\"\"If they hated the u.s. that much, anything is possible\"\"Everyone Blames Usama Bin Ladin, but it truly could be anyone.

'\"I think it is absolutely undescribable my feelings about how one human being could have so much hatred and malice towards another.  Osama is no better than the worst serial killers in jail.  In fact he is worse.  I also cannot believe that there are people who live in countries where terrorism is an everyday occurance and are cheering and happy that it happened to the USA.  Thousands died because of it and to cheer for that is SICK!! I think this makes them no better than the terrorists to see them reveling in the accomplishment of Osama Bin Laden.

I do however feel that people, in an effort to deliver some  payback  are going about a solution all wrong.  War is not the answer.

We aren\'t showing that we\'re better, we\'re showing we\'re bigger, and stronger, and that we can be completely hipocritical and go against everything our country stands for.  People are over reacting, and being irrational.  I agree that the issue of terrorism needs to be delt with promptly, and that the people whom have commited this hatred act have to  pay  some reprimendation, but not bombing the entire country that a few radical terrorist came from.  The US as a country, needs to take a second breath, and think of a better way to deal with this dilema.  \"\"They felt that this was right.

It is disturbing to hear the hatred in some people, even after something this tragic.\"religious understanding/charismatic leadershipbLMore commited to my city(NY)\"We have been enjoying a wonderful Indian Summer here in NY, but the forecasters are threatening us with a major drop in temperature with the front that is coming through today.  So I decided to take advantage of the gorgeous, warm day to go into the city. In order to reduce automobine traffic inthe city, a ferry now runs from the Army terminal in Brooklyn to South Ferry in Manhattan.  Parking and the ferry are free.  I would pay to ride this 20 minutes of harbor and East River past the Statue of Liberty, Governor\'s Island, and into the southern tip of Manhattan. Once in the city I walked north on Broadway then west to continue the perimeter of Ground Zero.  Because the public is kept a couple of blocks from the disaster area one does not get to visualize the extent of the damage.  From time to time the top tip of a crane might be seen working deep down in the lower reaches of the ruins, while workers who look as small as ants dig through the piles of rubble reaching several stories high. People gaze silently through fences covered in banners, pictures, flower bouquets, and other types of remembrances.  Workers in hardhats, policemen and soldiers in armed uniform, and the visitors who come to show their respects quietly patrol the perimeter in an air of sacredness. Only at one point on the east side of the site did I experience the acrid odor that is so often spoken of.  It is not unlike what I smelled from my apartment during the early days of the burning. I passed Trinity Church, then  St Pauls, and turned west past St Peter\'s(on Church St.).  These churches rimmed the terrorist strike site, yet the old edifices stood in tact.  I understand that St Paul\'s suffered not even a broken window.  During my visit to Connecticut Liz Springer suggested that this was a monument that God gave us to His faithfulness. I wanted to pray as I walked, but I hardly knew how.  God hasn\'t changed, yet so much has changed for so many families in our city and our country.  It was difficult for me to find words so i asked the spirit to groan for me. Most of the focus seems to be on the remains at the disaster site....... the rubble, the large crater, the odor, the skeletal remains.  I was impressed that there was another entirely difference aspect of what I was viewing.  There was light.  In a part of the city that was often described a canyon there was now a hugh open area with light. I hope that when people look at the rubble that is left of me when I die that there will be a sense of light left where I had been. My walk led me to Battery Park where I decided to go to the Holocaust Museum.  It just seemed like the thing to do.  And it was.  This relatively new museum is very well laid out to leave one with a sense of hope. On the first floor was a history that defined who the Jews are.  Then the second floor led one into and through the holocaust.  The more brightly lit top floor reviewed the post war recovery to the present of who the Jews are ............ a diverse people who survived through creativity, humor, and determination.  While religion is a part of the focus in this museum, there is tacit acknowledgement that cultural identity is probably more their strength than religion per se.  The experience of this people ought to bring hope to us in our present terror/ holocaust.  And, as I stepped into a lounge area on the third floor before the exit, the Statue of Liberty stood boldly behind the large glass wall on the harbor side of the building.  As a recently written poem states,  Ashes at her feet.  I strolled leisurely through Battery Park enjoyed the gardens that bloomed widely as if they had no knowledge of the approaching cold front.  After a hot dog from a street vender, I boarded the ferry back to Brooklyn. How does one summarize a day like that?\"I cancelled flightsbrainwashed people (terrorists)who have no regards for the value of human lifeIt is horrible!I have not ideaHave not changed.\"The actual people involved, and the master-mind behind them.\"\"I think that it was a huge tragedy and completely unexpected! I can not even begin to imagine what type of brain washing has to take place in order to convince suicide bombers that they will be praised and rewarded for such actions. What type of God or gods would praise and reward the taking away and destruction of human life, including one\'s own? These individuals were so discreet and well organized that there was no prewarning or external signs that would indicate such an event was getting ready to take place. There was no time to respond to nor counteract such an attack. And now, we are concerned about biologic warfare! What next?? Another thing that surprises me is the fact that the air space around and above the Pentagon was so unprotected. I think this was a huge wake-up call for the U.S. people and government, which serves to show us that we are not invinsible and are vulnerable to terrorism, just as other countries are. We have always heard about bombings and death in other countries, but it has never hit close to home, until now.

I couldn\'t believe it and I still can\'t.  Maybe that is because I used to live close to Manhattan for years and since I know the place quite well.  It\'s just unbelievable.  I want to go to New York and help directly the people who are still suffering because of this event, but since I don\'t live in the States right now, that may be hard to do.  So, I\'m thinking and searching for things I\'m able to do.

I didn\'t personally lose a loved-one or know anyone who was injured in these horrific events, but I was deeply touched.

When I\'m outside the airplanes are flying above my head, and they\'re like so close because they\'re getting ready to land.  I always look up whenever I hear one, just to make sure that it\'s not going to fall or crash into something.  I mean this is such a habit that I don\'t even realize what I\'m doing, but I know exactly why I\'m doing it, to make sure that I\'m not in danger.  I am terrified of flying!  I have flew once before, about 5 years ago, and I did not enjoy it at all.  Ever since then I\'ve been apprehensive about flying, but ever since 9-11, I am definitely never going to fly, unless I have to.  Even then, I think I would still find a way not to fly, I would rather drive 20 hours away, than take an airplane and get there in a few hours.  I just have this feeling that if I fly, something bad is going to happen, and I feel like it is my destiny to die in a plane crash.  I don\'t know if I\'m being excessively scared of flying, but for some reason I feel like God\'s telling me that something bad will happen to me if I fly. \"\"I am definitely more aware of what\'s going on around me.

To me America has always been a safe place to live and I\'ve always been proud to call myself and American.  On Sept. 11th I think the security and safety that Americans had once felt decreased.  I still feel safe living in this country but I now realize that we are not invisible to harm or in this case terrorist.  After the events my response was complete shock.  I never imagined that I would ever live to see something like what happened.  You always hear of events from the past such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor and never believe something like that could happen while you are alive.  I was stunned.  I cried.  My heart cried for all those who lost loved ones due to the stupidity of other people. So my deepest prayers went out to those who lost the ones they loved in the towers and those who were on the planes.  At that time my response turned to those who had led the attack.  My first response was to be angry and hate those who had done this.  But as a Christian, I prayed for those who had done this.  They need the prayers more than anyone right now.  I don\'t like who did this and I never will, but they still need prayers for only God can change them.  I don\'t know how anyone could do such a thing.  Thye have to be out of their minds to do what they did.  Another thing I took from these horribe events was the heros that we have working for us each and every day.  The firefighters go out everyday risking their own lives to save those of others.  They truly are American heros in my opinion.  It\'s been amazing to see the response of this nation.  I always knew that Americans stood strong for their country but the response after the 9-11 attack was incredible to me.

Walowing in her important emotions and, secondhand, in other people\'s reverent, grateful responses thereto, during the four or five days immediately following the disaster, has been, well, just, uh, well, an extremely, er, well, TIRESOME experience. What we have all taken away from our all-too-frequent contacts with her has been the overwhelming impression that this is a Skyline Issue, which is admittedly an unusual and refreshing perspective, omitting as it does anay reference to, forinstance, loss of life or the imminence of World War III. She is devastated, heartbroken. She is responding with episodes of what she calls her  own quiet tributes , where she just stands. In public. Looking devastated. Possibly waving a small flag in a bereft sort of way. OK. I\'m over it. I\'m going to hell when I die, but I don\'t even care. I bet I won\'t even notice the difference. I couldn\'t watch TV after Tuesday. I thought perhaps not having watched it for so many years would make it at least interesting in an anthropological sort of way, but it didn\'t. I watched some Peter Jennings and liked him OK, but everything else, especially the local stations, were appalling. Stupid, self-involved, hypocritical drivel. I went back to radio and newspapers. I eman, I\'ve always thought people shouldn\'t watch so much TV, and I now think work and learning are the best remedy for these horrors. One can\'t focus on tragedies uninterruptedly anyway; the midn closes down. I am one of those people who can only count,  One, two, three, many , anyway, so it doesn\'t do any good to keep bludgeoning myself. Better to allow myself to be intermittently overtaken or surprised by slivers of the truth that can stab my heart and really convey something. I have been thinking about Osama bin Laden and what I think of as  the work of betrayal , which was the title of a book about Judas Iscariot some years ago. You know: it\'s a rotten job, but somebody\'s got to do it. Bin Laden had beautiful eyes, brows, and forehead - the rest of his face is more Other (dark, full-bearded, fleshy of nose and lips), so harder to see if one is stubbornly Northern European. He is not sanpaku, he doesn\'t look unbalanced, fanatical, pinched, or bent, just intelligent, serious, thoughtful. Yet, he is probably responsible for a monstrous happening, like Iscariot being  responsible  for the crucifixion. If we don\'t experience these cataclysms, do we become more and more complacent, cynical and isolated from one another, etc., etc.? If these terros prompt us, over the long haul, to think more clearly; of they prompt us upwards another step; if they strip away our superficial armor, how is that not somehow good, and yet, and yet. . . . I was always horribly uncomfortable with the Dore engraving of Judas in the lowest circle of hell, being eternally gnawed by Satan. I have now lived long enough and read enough to realize how, incrementally, we are making our way, as a species, toward enlightenment. Cardinal Bevilaqua\'s letter, read from the pulpit on Sunday, September 16, emphasizes the need to leave vengeance to God and, especially, not to take out our frustration or grief on anyone easily identified with the terrorists, i.e., anyone of Middle Eastern aspect. Doesn\'t it feel as though at least some people have learned something in the last years, decades, centuries, millennia? This is so many notches up from a Crusade/Holy War sort of mentality. The Philadelphia Orchestra concert the same day was obviously designed to remind us of our interbeing - humans of every possible shape, color, and flavor were gently showcased, along with the music. Because of 9/11, we have a chance to see how far we\'ve come and to keep on slogging toward the higher ground. I know the people jumping from the Trade Towers mostly died in noise and flame and fear, chaotically, but I keep imagining them falling silently, like snowflakes, or metamorphosing into a river of birds, or falling to peaceful music,  cry[ing], Thank you, Thank you! all down the air, like guests thanking their host at the door , in the long ago words of Annie Dillard. I feel widened and softened by their deaths. Is that very odd? Of course, we have had to deal with the extreme irritation provoked by people who clutch their raddled breasts and ask rhetorically how God could allow such a thing to happen, which suggests that the concept of a seamless weaving has not caught on amongst the masses, who are still trying to get along using the old idea of Him and Us. Sigh. People generally have an insufficient inability to comtemplate complexity. \"I close all my blinds in my house at night and double check to make sure all the doors are locked.

I simply couldn\'t believe that anyone could do something like that on purpose.

I found out that all three of my brothers were on scheduled flights that morning. One brother took off out of LAX but his fight was quickly returned to LA when all of this started going down. The other two were stranded for days and couldn\'t get home. I thank God every moment that they weren\'t on those fated planes. It seems that everyone I know has been touched by these cowardly hijackers personally. Either they have lost someone close to them or know someone who has. Feeling completely helpless but wanting to do something, my boyfriend and I went out at lunch time last Tuesday to give blood at our local blood bank. We found out later that our blood was flown to Washington, D.C., so I hope that it was of some use. That evening, a deep, profound sadness came over me and lingered until about last Sunday. I couldn\'t stop crying for days. I didn\'t want to eat, I couldn\'t sleep and I had trouble focusing on work. I went to several memorial masses at my church, and by Sunday I think I had finally gotten a little perspective and some peace in my heart. I feel that I have been altered and will never be the same. I have a strong feeling of patriotism and pride in my country, however, I still have a feeling of dread about the long, drawn-out war that seems inevitable to occur. I am afraid to fly and really don\'t want to go any place where a large group of people is assembled (i.e., Disney, NFL or College football game, the mall, etc.). I am currently unemployed (struggling to start my own business) and my spending has been curtailed even further since the attack. I believe we are truly in an economic recession and I have zero consumer confidence at this time. I have dedicated my life and my belief system to peace, yet I feel that our country must make a strong response to these acts of terror. I have never been in favor of war but I am supportive of Bush and our government\'s actions so far. And me, a staunch liberal democrat! It seems like it was years ago that I was protesting against Bush  stealing the election.  Oh how times have changed! I think it is imperative for our country to get as many allies around the world to join us in this fight so that terrorists will know that they are not welcome in any land. I truly hope that any conflict will end quickly and with as little death and destruction as possible but I fear this is just a pipedream. I have a problem with destroying Afganistan just to find Bin Laden. The Afgani people have suffered so much for so long and this is the last thing they need, but something needs to be done. I also fear for the lives of Arab-Americans. I hope that we as a people have learned from our racism in World War II with Japanese-Americans, but I fear that some will take out their anger and aggression on these people. I hope not -- that would only be sinking to the level of atrocities committed by these terrorists! That is not what America stands for and I don\'t want to live in a world of fear, racism and hatred. Well, I\'ve written a book so I guess I should end this... Good luck with your research!  \"I am more aware of things. Osama Ben Laden\"there is no reason someone would do this. However, we are the enemy as we do not think or believe the same way he and his followeres do, therefor that is their reason.\"\"I was, and still am, in shock. I want to wake up and have it all be a horrible dream. Then, I realize I am awake. I am angry, but at who? Ben Laden is the first name I think of, but the afgan people will suffer more than he will. I am so sad, the lost of life was terrible. I am afraid, not deeply afraid and unable to go out, but araid and constantly aware of my surroundings. I don\'t know what we should od, but we should do something!\"0hatred of US politics and US foreign policygone to church more; looking for ways to show my support and patriotismunknown\"I think bin Laden was most likely behind it, but that is it more involved.  The politics of the Middle East is something that I have only recently been reading about.  There is a possibility that Iran is ultimately behind this or perhaps another country and is using bin Laden as the front man.  I don\'t know, though.\"\"As I said previously, I know look for the Sears Tower to see if another attack has been waged.  I am scared.  I am sad.  I watch the news as frequetly as possible.  I just want to know what is happening.  I talk to friends more, but am more combative and unnerved.  There are many changes that I don\'t even think I\'ve recognized yet as well.\"\"That is a hard question.  My thoughts vary sometimes from minute to minute right now.  It is a week today from the devastation, and it is still very salient for me.  I am concerned about the repercussions that this event will have, I still think about the people who were involved both as terrorists and as victims.  I can\'t erase the pictures of people jumping from the window, the plane colliding, or the thousands of people who are wandering NY with missing signs like ghosts or nomads, just wanting some information or closure.  I have found myself looking at the Sears Tower wondering if that will be next and if not, what?  Will it be Union Station?  Chemical warfare?  Biological warfare?  There is a pervasive melancholy and I am angry that my life in some respects has been put in jeopardy but people that I really didn\'t even know much about two weeks ago.  I don\'t want a war on our soil and I don\'t want to die.  I have been feeling so atypically patriotic and even bought a flag.  Tears well up when patriotic songs are played and I sometimes can cry with the number of truly good people are out there, helping and doing what they can to assist.  I feel sometimes that I am just being melodramatic and then I read more reports from national and international newspapers and realize that either we are all melodramatic or this is a very serious war that we have engaged ourselves in.  I try to figure out how things will change exactly.  I have also been trying to grapple with my own reaction and balancing my own horror and mourning with the need to move on with jobs, relationships, life.  It has been hard and I realize that if we invade many innocent people will be killed, and I do not want that, but I do not want my brother, mother, husband, friends killed either and it seems that this is what is has come to.  I am sure if this question was asked just a month from now our reactions would be much different, at least mine would.  I suppose only time will tell at this point.\"\"Hatred of America, desire to spread Muslim as a religion, and many other factors.\"\"Much more sad, quiet, teary eyed, short tempered, I feel as though my antennae are ultra sensitized and it hurts.  Yes, I\'m going to counseling soon. Thank you.\"\"Hate, political ambitions, feeling they have no other choices.  I believe belonging to SOMETHING to some people might feel better that quiet desparation.\"\"My entire world feels changed.  I worry so for my grown children, I worry so for my little grandchildren.  Everything seems upside down and inside out.  The attacks on September 11th have left me feeling so vulnerable, so out of control, so helpless in many ways.  I will dive back into counseling to help me feel better - but in the meantime I read all of the mental health suggestions - connecting with friends, exercise, journaling and the rest.  But I ALWAYS have done these things and still, late at night, the fright swells up.  And just when I feel I am on the path to mourning (I do not know anyone directly involved), another news report, another anthrax, more bombing of innocents in Afghanistan, more hunger, more fear, more death. I understand America is not without blame - I love my country, but at times not my government.  And to hear the simplistic rhetoric from supposed educated people in government is incredulous!  We\'re dropping peanut butter sandwiches to people who don\'t even know what it is, in the same yellow colored packages that cluster bomb parts come in!  My Dear Lord, who IS in charge here?  Be extra alert, but go about our regular business . . . . .and the list goes on.  Ellen Goodman\'s columns have spoken about how I feel . . . . .nothing feels secure.  Sort of like walking on earthquake damaged ground, everything is shifting.  And the TREMENDOUS amount of unemployment, pain and hurt.  And the horror all of the children of those killed.  Where will it all end - if at all?!\"\"Hate, political ambitions, and total alienation from all that is good.

'\"As a non-American I suppose I have an advantage of not being a direct target of the Terrorists who perpetrated the event, therefore I can remain objective. However no-one could be failed to be moved by the devastation and surreal images we all witnessed world wide. The images of human beings hurtling to their deaths, was disturbing and the repitition of these images on our screens, was disgusting. The media turned an atrocity into a freak show. On the actual event itself, I am afraid to say that I am surprised that nothing like this hasn\'t happened sooner. Because of the show of aggression and domination of the American nation on the world stage which has been phenomenal in the last century. And as an old proverb says  what goes round comes round.  However this does not vindicate the way in which these fanatical men behaved, and should also serve as a lesson to us all that religious fundamentalism is dangerous, therefore perhaps the Yanks want to look at their own version of religious fanatics or Christian fundamentalists. \"\"Not at all, since I believe there is little that can be done to stop nut cases.\"\"To pay back for American intervention in the Middle East, such as Bombing Iraq, Libya, and siding with the Zionists.\"\"Religious Fundamentalists, of the Muslim Faith.

I have also been paying more attention to the news.\"\"A few positive outcomes have resulted from this terrible tragedy.  Americans are more patriotic and more supportive of our president.  Also, many have donated time, money, and even blood to help the victims.  Rescue workers risked their lives to save those of others.  However, these changes are not permanent.  Although Americans have been very sympathetic and caring toward others here in our country, there has also been a very violent reaction toward the perpetrators.  The desire for revenge is everywhere, and this worries me.  A war won\'t solve anything, especially since it means that many more innocent people will die, Americans as well as those in other countries.  Obviously, we need to take action, but violence is not the answer.  History has proven this time and time again.  Fighting fire with fire would be an enormous mistake.\"Osama Bin Laudin\"A nation beaten and economically crippled looking to find hope anywhere they can.

I hope we don\'t lower ourselves to be as base and prejudiced as our attackers. \"I have gotten in touch with my family and friends more often.A terrorist group comprised of Muslim extremists.They have a great deal of hatred for the US.  And because they feel it is the most effective way to achieve their personal/religious/political goals.  \"At first I really had trouble perceiving the attack as real.  The media coverage of it and the images we saw seemed so like special effects in a movie.  I think that helped me distance myself from the attack.  I felt for probably the rest of that week that this was a terrible tragedy but that it was somebody else\'s.  Since I didn\'t loose anybody directly, I felt that it didn\'t effect me emotionally and emersed myself in the politics of the event and the impact on our society, economy etc.  I even was a bit annoyed at first because it seems that in an event such as this that everyone wants a piece of the action, everyone wants to feel involved.  I saw a posting for a stress management workshop at work to help us all deal with the event.  When I read it, I thought how everyone was overreacting and that it somehow was an insult to those actually involved for me to consider this my own tragedy even when I wasn\'t directly affected at all.  As time has passed, I have felt increasingly sad.  It turns out a coworker of my husban was killed in the Pentagon crash and I get upset when I think about his family and all of the other families involved even though I still do not know any of them personally.   Tues. morning (almost one week to the minute of the attacks) I had a nightmare which involved the death of several of my loved ones and my own death as well.  I woke up and began sobbing uncontrollably as soon as I remembered the dream.  As time passes I am more and more suprised how in spite of myself the attacks have affected me emotionally a great deal.  \"I feel like a zombie...numbed...shocked...a select group of anti-amican religious radicals influenced by Usama bin LadenWhen I found out about this horrible event I was shocked and at the same time thought that this might all be a hoax.

I am constantly aware now that America is not immune to this sort of attack. \"\"Our country is going through an awful tragedy that was caused by terrorists who hate Americans. So many innocent lives were stolen, so many families are mourning the loss of their loved ones. Anyone could have been on those planes or in the World Trade Center twin towers, you or me. These terrible people are going to pay for taking our citizens and making us feel unsafe in our own homes and offices. The hijackers were willing to kill themselves in order to attack America. Those passengers on the plane that crashed in Somerset County, PA knew they were going to die anyway, so they expressed some real heroism and perhaps saved hundreds more lives.  So much has happened to our country this last week and a half, I find it hard to organize my thoughts. While I did not lose anyone close to me, I am mourning with the rest of the country. I like many others were worried that some of my closest friends were in or near the World Trade Centers when these attacks happened, but fortunately they were not.  I am very scared about what is next. I am scared of war, I am scared of more attacks, I am scared to fly. But if I let these fears rule my life, these terrorists have won. I will not let them win. I am flying this weekend to see my family and plan my wedding for next August. I will not let them win. We will not let them win. I love America and I am proud of the citizens that are uniting.

Fear and anxiety - what might happen next, what other terrorist acts might have been concealed by our government in the past and/or passed off as accidents, worry that desire for revenge will dominate and drag us into an ill-conceived military effort (I have a draft-age son). Concern about justice issues - we are appalled at images of Palestinians celebrating, but no one asks whether we\'ve been guilty of celebrating acts we\'ve perpetrated against others, or why people in these other countries feel the way we do, whether they have a justified grievance - I would have hoped that as a nation we would do more soul-searching about why we are hated and resented so much in some quarters and what if anything we might do about it if we understood. Also I\'d wish this event brought us to empathize more with people the world over who have not had the American luxury of physical and economic security, and wish to do more to address their suffering now that we feel it, too.\"I suppose it is likely that the al-Qaid network is responsible as alleged.\"I checked my car for bombs as taught to do when I lived in Europe 15 years ago.

'I am more skeptical that the world will ever find true--non-military imposed peace.\"At first I felt shocked and numb. Then I started feeling sad that there are people in this world that could do something like that. I also felt sad that people think violence is a solution to their problems, or the world\'s problems. I have watched the events in the Middle East, in Serbia and elsewhere with the same type of sadness. I am afraid that the more we wield violence, whether domestically in relationships, or in promoting political philosophies, the more violence will be using violence to resolve conflict. I am resigned to the reality that our country will engage in some violence to seek a solution to a violent act. Perhaps it is a necessary evil, like when Hitler had to be confronted. I suppose that in the end, people like animals are territorial in nature---why then do we supposedly have a superior brain. Why are we able to invent and find solutions. I daresay that the world spends more time and resources preparing for war, then preparing for peace. What types of resources do we have alloted to finding peace? How much to military might? I don\'t know. All I know is that I feel equally sad when we are bombed, as when we do the bombing--in both cases, it is terrifying to those on the receiving end. We are lucky to have resources and help those families whose loved ones were killed and hurt---those we go into conflict with don\'t always have the resources to care of the wounded and the dead, and the families that are left to cope. My role as I see it is to pray real hard for the Great Creator to guide us so that in the end, we are a much better nation and people---who feel for ourselves and for others too. Personally, this has made me reflect more about how I feel about a great many things. I do not feel vengence in my heart, though I do hope the people responsible for this will be caught and submitted to the full force of the legal system. I also understand that some folks will want blood...it\'s hard to blame them.  I feel uncomfortable because I grew up with Vietnam...and I have a 23 year old son. So yes. I have been unable to sleep about what this means to him and us as a family. But like I said, I am resigned that we will resort to violence to resolve violence.

'\"The destruction of the World Trade Center and part of the Pentagon was an act of pure hatred and revulsion towards the United States.  I consider the people who perpetrated these acts to be misguided, at best, and malevolent, at worst.  That said, I am also appalled by the lack of interest on the part of Americans of what is happening in the rest of the world.  Terrorism has been rampant throughout the world for over 20 years and we have shrugged as if it were just  those people.   It is as if the thing does not exist until we are hit between the eyes with it.  That willful ignorance and/or blindness to world affairs has, and will continue to, cost us dearly.   I cannot bear the idea of bombing the people of Afghanistan for the actions of a militant, repressive government.  There are undoubtedly supporters of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, but most of the people are simply trying to survive.  I also have no doubt that we would not be bombing Ireland if the IRA had been the responsible parties.  There would be summits, drawn-out negotiations, not simply demands and threats.

'\"As of now, it is not entirely certain.  The media is pointing our attention to Osama bin Laden and associated terrorist cells.  I am waiting for clear evidence.\"\"It is impossible to genuinely know.  Yet, it seems that these are NOT psychological fragile people.  Rather, they are psychologically stable to some degree and able to steel their emotions even in the face of suicide and homicide.  Such people must truly believe they are doing something important enough to die for, such as a deeply held religious committment combined with experiences that cumulatively justify their convictions that the US (and the West?) should pay dearly.  Such a person might feel that their sacred places and norms have been deeply violated by past US actions...\"\"I am deeply saddened and troubled by the events of September 11, 2001.  I believe the taking of innocent lives was wrong and that nothing can truly justify what was done. I pray for those who are grieving the loss of loved ones and those traumatized by the events physically and mentally.  Lord have mercy.  As horrid as it might sound, I also believe it is important to pray for those who supported this action.  How is it that the terrorists who suicided--and those who agree with their actions--could come to such a point of view?  In what ways has our nation desecrated their sense of what is right or ignored their sufferings?  I feel we must attempt to understand so that we can appropriately respond in a just way, not a vengeful way.  I believe vengeance would serve the function of spreading a salve on our own angry wounds, rather than on responding with genuine justice.  We must not kill innocents.  If we say it was wrong for the terrorists to kill our innocents, then I believe it is wrong to kill other innocents in an effort to respond to these events. There is much to say, but I will stop here.  \"\"I am praying even more about world events.  I am talking about, thinking about, and watching/listening to the media re: topics related to the attacks.  I am contemplating mortality and what is worth living and dying for in a deepened way...\"Osama bin Laden and his band of fanaticsi\'m still walking around in a fogwhy indeed\"Being a US citizen, and a New Yorker, this is my perspective. Life changed drastically and forever in a brief instant. Suddenly we are cast in a horror movie. Ophrah said is best yesterday at Yankee Stadium....trying to find the meaning now in our everyday lives.\"\"I am horrified and frightened that an attack of such a large scale could happen here.  The way it was done, plotted and methodically planned, with many people involved who have lived here for years and taken advantage of our training and hospitality and many opportunities, is particularly outrageous.  I do not believe my life or that of my family or any of us will ever really be the same. I lived in Israel  during the war in 1973 and found it a frightening time, with many difficult experiences.  When it was over, I could come home and be safe.  This is my home, and there is no where I could go to be safe. At the same time, while I support any action to retaliate against proven terrorists, there is nowhere to place blame beyond those individuals.  Nothing would horrify me more than to see justifiable range inappropriately vented on decent Americans and international students because of their ethnic background.  That would be a greater victory for terrorism than the loss of all our lives. I am a mental health professional.  At no time has the line between myself and my patients been more fuzzy.  We are all human beings, suffering in this together.  The first day, I was a wreck.  Very anxious and symptomatic and just wanting to gather my family in a safe refuge.  The next day I went to work.  I opened my office door and looked at my chair, behind my desk.  I said to myself,  that is your seat, kiddo, you need to sit on that side of the desk.   And I became quite fine and in control, able to override my own anxiety and emotions enough to reach out to the people who came through the door looking for my help.  And then, I went home and hugged my family. That is all I can do, and what I will continue to do.\"\"A very large sophisticated terrorist operation, probably funded by Osama bin Laden and supported by others.\"To create fear and unrest and destroy the heart and soul of a freedom-loving culture\"I am more in the moment, reaching out and connecting more, and trying to strengthen the fabric of love and connection of which I am a part.\"\"I believe that Bin Lauden plays with semantics. I suspect  that his brand of anger and hate is stamped all over this  event.  I suspect he raised the monies and told his men the target is the United States. Do what needs to be done.  Make them hurt and bleed but do not tell me what you actually plan.  He feels his concsience is clear that he had no direct knowledge or planning in this attack, but none the less the hate he instills in others and men similar to him are the route cause of this evil.  I do not know how we combat such deep seated hatred of other Human beings.\"\"I am shocked, horrified and still disbelieving my eyes. How could any member of the human race do this? I am deeply concerned and worried about our goverment and in  particular our response to this as human beings. Revenge is mine saith the Lord!  How dare we think that our so called  idea of justice can be thought of as anything other than revenge.  On the other hand if out military is indeed capable of a major covert operation that will route out the base of these problems without major civilian casualties it must be done. Then does it make us a less free and open society not to know what has been done in the name of these United States.  My family has been involved in so many ways from the 1st  cousin who stood outside a buildin in Lower Manhattan and watched and ran,  to sister stranded in route home from Europe to Manhattan, to nephews who are active members of the military, and finally to the teens at home who are worried their friends and loved ones will be drafted.   Another words I am conflicted: hurt, scared, saddened and deeply worried. And yet like everyone else I am trying to keep working.  I only pause today for the High Holiday and then I watch the police outside my small city\'s congregation and think.. and what about Israel?\"I am concerned about being in large public places.   I am glad that my eldest is repeating her junior year of high school so that we do not have to fly cross country to look at colleges.

From hate comes more hate and their goals  are being met in some indirect method.Belief systems so very different than our own.

My behavior is inconsistent, which bugs me.

What have they got to lose?  \"I laid in bed for the first couple of days watching the war on TV and didn\'t even answer my phone.   I give massages for a living.  One of my clients is Pakistani.  He tried to make an appointment on 9/11, and kept trying for the next couple of days.  When he finally got through, I let him come over.  When I opened the door, he walked in and hugged me.  He cried, I cried, he cried, I cried... I asked him how he was doing.  He said it was pretty hostile out there.  I asked if he needed me to gas up his car or buy him some groceries.  He said he just needed a massage.   I\'ve been trying to understand what happened by reading the United Nations report on the Origins and Evolution of the Palestinian Problem.  Why on earth did  we  take land away from the Palestinians and set up a Jewish Nation when the Jews had been a diaspora for 2000 years?  It really pisses me off that I can\'t even ask that question without being afraid that people will call me anti-semitic.  What the Palestinians have been suffering for the past 50 years is a smidgen short of genocide and I can see why they are suidical.  I admire their courage.  I shall keep reading to try and understand how the US got the responsibility, when it was Britain that convinced the League of Nations to give Jews the Palestinian\'s land... And why we agreed to it. Of course it\'s all about money.  But there were anti-zionist Jews, and many chose not to go there.  There was something really creepy (to me) about the Zionist Jews.  They scare me like perverted hell fire and brimstone Baptist Preachers, pedophlia Priests and Fundamental Moslems. And that\'s the root of the problem.     \"Wouldn\'t surprise me if GW set it up to be perfectly honest.  I also accept that terrorists did it.

I am afraid of what the revenge might bring upon us. I live in Eastern Europe, probably never in danger of terrorists, but a war might reach to us, too. I am empathic (burst into tears seeing a movie, etc.), the whole day of Sept. 11 spent nervous watching tv news, calling friends, and crying for those people dying or loosing someone. I was touched by the story of the woman called by her husband from the 3rd plane, as she listened when they tried to get the plane back from the terrorists, listened to the crash, and still holding the phone for half an hour, while hope vanishes, that they could have survive.

'\"I work in Manhattan, but not in the financial district.  I work in midtown, but was able to see the smoke and the towers burning.  When the first plane hit, I felt like it was a terrible accident.  Surely no one could have intentionally endangered so many people.  When the second plane hit the tower I felt like, I don\'t know.  Kind of like the ground had been pulled out from under me.  All the radios at work were blasting, and the one television we did have, had no sound.  But I watched the video being replayed over and over.  I felt compelled to watch it time and time again.  I did not feel anything was real.  I was in the office, and everyone else was there, but it was like they were all unreal.  The other attacks on the Pentagon, and the plane crash in PA. only increased the shock--layer after layer.  There was a great need to talk with my children and brother, all of which were almost impossible to contact.  I wanted to leave, get off of Manhattan island and go home, which was not possible .  I live on Long island, and the Railroad was shut down.  I walked along 7th Ave. by Penn Station, feeling terribly trapped.  Thousands of people were in the street, and there was dead silence.  The quiet was frightening.  The only sound made you look skyward to see the military fighter jets flying over.  I wanted to walk to 59th St. and walk across the bridge, but a coworker who also lives on LI was afraid to leave Penn Station area, soI stayed with her.  We really didn\'t talk.  No one was talking, other then to say  Oh my God!  I can\'t believe this.   I was one in the midst of thousands and felt totally alone.  I get angry with myself, as I am a nurse, and I should be helping.  I went to the precinct to volunteer, but was told thay for the moment, there was an overflow of medical help, but to  stand by .  OK, good.  I offered.  Whoopee.  Now what?  The feeling was one of sleepwalking-surreal, unimaginable.  By the time I did get home, I hugged my family and became glued to the television.  The more I listened and watched, the more angry I became.  Totally confused.  Why?  What did we do?  Logically, I knew that a strike must be planned, but I wanted action.  NOW!  I was angry and I am still angry.  With each passing day, I felt as if the rest of the world is going merrily along their way, but I am not.  I go to work, do my job, and want little more then to be home.  I am filled with such a sense of profound sadness.  The outward displays of patriotism I find somewhat reassuring.  I pass FDNY Engine Co.1,Ladder 24 several times a day.  I work across the street from St. Francis of Assisi, where Father Mychal Judge live and served, and go there frequently during my lunch time.  I hang out my office window to watch and listen to the funerals said at this church.  There are faces and  Good Mornings  missing from the FDNY.  There are faces missing from the Railroad station, and cars that had stayed unmoved for 2 weeks.  There is a silence that is cutting.  Coming from the Viet Nam era, I always claimed to be a pacifist.  Not any more.  Go flatten the country.  They were given warning of impending bombings, and had time to leave.  If civilians get killed---I\'m sorry.  They didn\'t care about our innocent civilians.  No chance to erradicate terrorism should go unused.  No symbolic gestures like during the Clinton administration.  These are terrorists.  They are evil and need to be eliminated.  I am angry!  I watch the news, the funerals, read whatever I can find about all this endlessly.  This is where I run into a problem.  I am a crier.  But the most that happens is that my eyes well up with tears, but then I lock down.  I, and all of America, have been greatly violated.  My heart breaks over and over.  I worry about the FDNY, NYPD, EMS.  I fear for their mental health.  I wonder what the suicide rate is going to be.  I feel guilty for feeling tis sad, and I wasn\'t at the Trade Center. (survivor guilt I am sure)  I have prioritized and reprioritized my life.  Reevaluated what is and is not important in life.  Amazingly, I guess, I am not afraid.  Just so sad.  I still want and need to talk about this, but so many people don\'t want to talk about it anymore.  But I still need to talk about it.  I feel relatively alone with these feelings, even thugh I know others feel this way too.  I have an increased need to sleep, and can become very irritable, which isn\'t like me.  I want to run and hug a cop or a fireman and say thank you.  Too many emotions. \"for power\"Feel much greater dissatisfaction with my job, less tolerant of pettiness, keeping in closer touch with family and friends, definitely a boostering of my religious beliefs\"Osama bin Laden and an international  army  of terrorists\"I am sicked by the events and I have vowed to be more of an activist for free speech, free press, compassionate listening, and peace.\"We have brought it on ourselves by our 100 years of imperialism and greed.\"That someone was obviously desperate to right some perceived (and real) wrongs. They are protesting and now we are escalating the violence, inviting further violence. \"\"    What the bin Laden group did was horrible and totally unacceptable. But the reaction from GWB and Washington is also truly reprehensible.  This is the time when we should be listening to the rest of the world as to why we are so hated. It is an ideal time to re-think our foreign policy and change it.  War is never the answer. It is obviously not that we are richer and freer and have better fast food that we are hated.  Guilani threw $10,000,000 back at a Saudi because he wanted to point out  why  the attack took place. Bush and Condeleeza are clamping down once again on a press that is already under corporate influence and the press is lying down and agreeing with them. We are getting totally brainwashed by the media. No one other than KPFA and a few progressive periodicals is reporting the backlash, the blowback, and the many demonstrations for peace. And we are bombing Afghanistan where the people are already starving and homeless. It\'s as if everyone has lost their reason in this flag waving country. I just bought a beautiful flag with our Earth pictured, and it\'s our Earth we should be protecting, not just our oil interests and our corporate economy.        Okay, we lost about 5000 innocent people.  Do we ever consider the 5000 who die each month in Iraq because of our sanctions and continuing bombing? Do we ever consider that Palestinians who continually die because we are backing the Israeli terrorists? Do we ever consider that maybe now is the time to cut down on Star Wars and concentrate on beefing up (or diumbing down)our intelligence?         Anyway, it\'s enough to give any educated person a migraine. Thanks for asking.    \"\"the leaders do it because they are either crazy, or sociapathic as well as megamaniacal and down-right nasty.  the people they lead, well some of them are probably of the same ilk as their leaders.  the rest are sadly deluded, desperate, small people.\"\"none, really, except i fly an american flag off my chevy blazer.  and i re-learned the words to  God Bless America .\"\"a tightly-knit,  well-funded group of terribly desperate people who have been (for the most part) deluded into believing that acts like this will result in divine acceptance and the belief that they went out like heros.

The Initial Shock initial reaction was complete shock, followed by horror, followed by a chilled numbness.  that any one person could be so filled with hate that they could perpetrate this kind of violence on innnocent citizens boggles the mind.  that an entire network of well financed, intellectually intelligent hate mongers exists is beyond comprehension.   Thoughts on the Perpetrators how desperate must one\'s life be to be driven to the point where one believes that there is salvation and heroism in such hideous deeds.  these people are truly pathetic and deserve our utmost sympathy.  there lives are a complete tragedy.  it\'s not possible that all of the people that were necessary to plan such a campaign are insane...it\'s unlikely that they suffer from mass hypnosis.  it is more likely that they suffer from such inhumane conditions in their  home  country that life itself seems hopeless.  these people then become easy prey for the actual madmen that  run  them, like osama bin laden. On our own State of Unpreparedness as to us, how could we ever have become so complacent.  how was it possible that people from third world countries, in a network spread out all over the world, were able to coordinate and execute such an attack with absolutely no knowledge by any of our so-called  intelligence agencies .  how could things in the public domain, such as the article in that london-based arabic newspaper, quoting bin laden as say he would perpetuate unprecedented acts of terrorism on the u.s., completely slip by us.  what is the point of draining billions and billions of dollars into the FBI, CIA, NSA, etc., if they cannot protect us?  look how quickly we are now rounding up suspects, accomplices, material witnesses...were NONE of these clues available to us BEFORE the disaster???  maybe our men need to use some of the same  intelligence  that bin laden\'s people use...they seem to be successful. On Compassion and Brotherhood let us NOT succumb to the low level of verbal and physical abuse towards our arab-american and pakistani-american brothers and sisters.  they decry this hideous crime as much as we do.  it is not their fault that many mad-men from their countries are willing to perform evil deeds.  that would be the same as saying that every middle-aged white male with a beard that lives in a remote cabin in the northern U.S. is as despicable as the Unabomber...get a grip folks.  this should be a time when you show even more compassion to everyone than ever before...we all hurt. On Retailation and Retribution Our war is not with Afgahnistan...or even the Talibnan as horrible as they are (yes, we have a humanitarian war agains the Taliban, but that is not this war).  Our war is with a highly organized group of terrorist cells that live all over the world.  Bin Laden is obviously one of the financiers and leaders...but not the only one.  Strafing Afgahnistan with untargeted bombings makes us no better than the terrorist.  We must proceed with caution and care.  We must target the individuals responsible for terrorism, and not the innocent citizens of the countries they live in...two suspected terrorists were found in Germany, attending German schools.  Should we wipe Germany off the map?  What about Florida?  It appears the U.S.  harbored  many of these criminals in Florida.  Should we take out Florida?

'I spend more quality time with my family and I make sure daily that they know how much they are lovedcowardly terrorist lead by Osama Bin Laden\"    I believe the attacks on Sept. 11 were the acts of true cowards . Instead of getting their beliefs across to the world they just succeeded in the meaningless killing of thousands of people.

I also hope that the families and loved ones of the victims directly affected by the attacks find the strength and courage to prosper . I had never seen so many true American heroes as I did in the days and weeks following Sept.11. GOD BLESS !\"they are cowards with no respect for lifeI believe it was a tragedy of extreme proportions. I grieve for the pain of all involved. And may all those that have passed rest in peace forever. I think the way that the people in the USA have united is magnificent. Yet it seems a little disheartining that other countries have rushed to such aide and mourning yet when people in other countries are ripped from there homes and killed on a daily basis in places such as Palestine and Bosnia no one seems to bat an eye. So I guess its ok for then to be executed on a daily basis. Yet a tragedy occurs in the USA and because not all nations are weeping they are seen as evil.

I was angry that this tragedy had to occur on my special date, forever associating itself with one of the happiest days of my life--and I felt like a schmuck being concerned about that in the face of so many other people\'s deaths and great loss.  But it still seemed so non-real to me. Soon though, I was very angry and wanted to strike back immediately, hard and unmercifully.  I was appalled that people should actually behave in such a manner (the terrorists) and at the same time glad that we as a nation had finally woken up to this terrible blight that has for a long time affected the daily lives of people in other parts of the world--and that we would finally be willing to do something about it.  I am a peace lover, but I think we would be doing the world a favor if we wiped terrorists, their supporters, and the Taliban (how truly horrible and evil they are!) off the face of the planet.  In thinking about it deeply, I came to the conclusion that these people are so infected and permeated with evil and hatred, that there is nothing we or anyone can do to change them or affect their beliefs.  They are like a cancer that has to be destroyed. I felt sick that this horrendous tragedy had befallen our nation--the loss of life is impossible to truly grasp and feel, but also what is symbolizes goes so deeply into our psyches and hearts.  It felt like a poisoned arrow piercing my guts.  I hope that our wake-up call will stay with us and keep our resolve and our compassionate unity strong. Then something good will have come out of all this. My heart feels glad to see the renewed patriotism, courage, and strength of our country and the first-time-in-history unity of much of the world.  Did we need this whack on the side of  the head to move into the next stage of human evolution? I worry that things will escalate into biological, chemical, or nuclear catastrophes.  I worry that our economy ( and therefore that of the whole world) will suffer a fatal blow.  I worry that our way of life and our freedoms will never be the same.  But at the same time, I refuse to be fearful.  If their goal is terror and fear, then I consider it my duty to cultivate a sense of happiness, courage, creativity, faith in the future, and normalcy.  And I am doing a pretty good job of it so far.  I had planned a plane trip to San Francisco in October, and I\'m still going to go--and have a great time. I thank God that my husband and I are together.  If I had been living a solitary life, as I did for so many years, I would feel much more in despair.  It\'s hard to deal with fear and horror by yourself.  I felt that no matter what happened, at least we had found each other and wold always have each other to rely on and to feel love amidst the darkness. Sometimes tears come, in waves--when I think of the people in the planes or those jumping out windows or those who lost loved ones so needlessly.  The horror and sadness of that is unspeakable and unforgiveable.  But I try not to let this sadness turn to depair.  And in fact I feel quite hopeful about our new, more aware future.  And I hope so profoundly that we will all keep our resolve, our feelings of brotherhood, and our strength. So I pray every morning for our leaders--that they will have wisdom, creativity, strength, foresight, fortitude; and for those who fight the good fight--that they will be safe, brave, and successful; for our nation--that we will change for the better and find new ways to make our way of life the best there is; for the people of the world--that victims will no longer be victimized and that all will join our cause; and for the terrorists--that they will be filled with love instead of hatred.  It makes me feel like I am making some sort of contribution.   I feel wounded but on the road to recovery.  I feel stunned but galvanized.  I feel horrified but hopeful that something good that we can\'t imagine yet will come out of this.  I feel proud that we have reacted--common people and leaders both--the way we have.  I feel like an American--something I never really bothered to feel before.  I feel part of a nation that has a purpose--and I love purpose; it\'s been sadly missing. I still keep watching the news and being newly horrified.  I am waiting, as patiently as I can--for our forceful response.  I know it will be a long struggle.  I pray for continued patience and resolve for all of us.  I want someone to write a song that captures all our feelings and motivates us.  I want there to be a symbol we all can believe in.  I want some meaning to become apparent. I wish it never happened, and I could go back to September 11 being my anniversary, a day of complete happiness.  But that will never be, and I have begun to accept that.  If it changes us all for the better, then that will be the meaning I seek.\"\"I was very upset about the events of September 11th. I thought that the United States was a safe country and that terrorists would never strike on U.S. soil. I feel terrible for people who lost loved ones in the attacks. I also feel scared about future attacks that may occur, especially given the recent anthrax scare.\"\"I feel afraid when I use the subway or go near a landmark in NYC. I am more aware of those around me, and watch for people who are behaving suspiciously.\"For revenge against U.S. foreign policy in the Middle EastAl Qaeda networkI assume it is the people our president is after.

'I am less likely to feel safe on an airplane.  I say  I love you  more often.  \"I feel unsafe.  I am afraid of the future.  In my opinion, war is wrong.\"I don\'t know.I don\'t know.\"Hmm .. My thoughts and feelings when? If I would have been asked in the hours directly following the attack I probably would have answered \'scared to death and mad as hell\'. Oh, wait. That answer still applies. Only now it\'s tempered with a thousand other thoughts and feelings. I\'m still scared. I\'m scared of retailiating and I\'m scared of not retailiating. I\'m scared if we retailiate how do I explain it to my kids when I\'ve preached \'turn the other cheek\'. I\'m scared if we strike back, will they strike back even harder? I\'m frightened that if we don\'t strike back we\'re sending a message to our sons that they no longer have the responsibility to grow up and as men, protect the things that they hold precious. I worry that my kids will grow up without the pride in being an American that I always assumed was just plain there. It never needed a justification before, it was just evident. I wonder what the consequences will be of explaining to them that evil was born out of a religious devotion when I\'ve always prayed that they would hold a faith so close to their hearts .. will they someday be suspicious that faith is a fertile ground for evil? God, I hope not. I\'ve learned some lessons too. I\'ve increased my viligance against relying on a sound-byte length attention span. I don\'t want to be colored by the media telling me how to feel or the president telling me that it\'s time to stop grieving. Maybe it\'s that I don\'t trust the people anymore that I assumed would warn me of this. You know what\'s probably the worst part? I found a hard spot that I didn\'t think that I had. There is a part of me that isn\'t interested in looking at the reasons that the terrorists struck, that just wants a swift and tidy revenge. Even worse, there are times when I wish I could forget what happened. It\'s disconcerting to find such a blatantly self-centered edge in myself. Above all, I\'ve worried that I\'m not exposing my kids to the *right* way to deal with this, or the *right* way to think about this, because I have no idea what that is. I wish I could find a way to teach them to temper tolerance with healthy suspicion without making them question stereotypes and encouraging bigotry. ::shrug::.. I like to think that focusing on the heroes that were born in NYC and DC helps to teach them some things about right and wrong. \"Heh .. I\'m more suspicious. I now shop for bottled water to stock pile. I hug my kids more tightly when I send them to school. I watch 100\% more television than I ever have in my life. I\'m not planning a vacation for next summer. \"Ultimately? The ancestors of the men who highjacked the planes for breeding into their children an ability to accept a flawed perception of faith. More directly? The Taliban shows some complicity. Bin Laden probably funded the attack. Arafat is responsible, more directly than we give him credit for. He modeled a behavior to people who are now of an age to emulate his behavior. \"Misguided values. Ignorance. Faith. Need for acceptance. Because they could.\"I don\'t know, I just don\'t know- out of lots of hate for Americans and humanity\"\"Everyone is talking about Bin Laden (if maybe not him directly, he definitely funded the operation), I guess he is the only one I have to chose from right now.  I could not even imagine that it would be some Americans.  \"\"So far my behaviors that I can control have not changed that much.  I have watched more news than ever before.  Although, now I worry about death a lot and have trouble sleeping and cry more at night.  I am going on a plane this weekend, so I am not sure how I am going to react to that, but my friend is really worried about my safety, but I think it is fine.  My dad would not let me go otherwise, plus now is the time that security is the strictest.\"\"I do not know anyone directly injured or killed in the attack, but I know several people that it is effecting in its aftermath.  This whole situation really scares me.  It is hard for me to imagine being in a war.  Most of the people who are going to be sent off are in my age group- in my generation.  They are my friends.  I also don\'t know if going and attempting to kill one person is the answer.  I am terribly upset about all the events, and I don\'t want to take an attitude of doing nothing, but the situation is so difficult.  I can only criticize without really coming up with any other solutions.  I don\'t want any more innocent people to die in a war nor do I want more people to be killed as revenge for killing another who is responsible.  These people are all over the place and it will be hard to get them all.  I am also nervous, not just because my friends would be leaving, but how is this country going to change.  My boyfriend wants to go and join the army if they need him- I already live in a different city from him now, but I can\'t imagine him overseas and in danger all the time.  And then I think about all the hate that is going on right here in our country.  My friend is Indian and her brother is recieving death threats because he looks Pakistani.  Another one of my friends on campus is receiving horrible telephone calls.  If we start stereotyping people now and acting in hateful ways, they are just going to get mad.  This is exactly what the terrorists wanted to divide us.  I just wish that people would see that.  I am worried about my friends and how they are being treated, I am worried for our country, I am worried about the impending war.  I can\'t even imagine what it would have been like to be in the building on that day.  I heard a man talking about it he was just saying that he was in a group of people and every moment that group was getting smaller.  I can\'t watch the news without crying.  I want to move on from all of this, but at the same time I feel terrible about it.  It is so far away, and yet so close at the same time.  We still had classes when it happened and I kept asking myself way I am in class when this horrible thing is going on- does public speaking really matter that much today.  I live with three very compassionate people who share my views and empathy for those directly invovled in the tragedy which helps- but I hear other people talking and just saying that we should blow up Pakistan.  Then I hear that India is trying to bargain with us for their support.  I am just so shocked that another country would take advantage of us this situation.  I couldn\'t handle having to fight their war also.  This is all so crazy.  It is really hard to take in and find out where we go from here.  I just hope that people start to calm down and not take their frustation out on other Americans.  It is a slow process to get rid of prejudice, but we were making some what head-way.  I hate to see all that head-way go to waste.  I am also proud of many celebrities and others who I watched to jump to the aid of everyone.  That telethon and all the people going to donate blood.  I even saw a story about a little girl who gave away her teddy bear to child who she thought needed it more.  It is great that we can bond in these ways, I just wish that people would be able to extend thier selflessness and tolerance to all Americans.  All my thoughts are just a jumble still ruminating in my head.  Its like all those thoughts are still there, but at the moment I am trying to push them away so I focus on what I need to do now.  It is a weird feeling going on and still remembering.\"They felt we have too much and they have too littleI probably won\'t fly unless it\'s absolutely necessaryI\'m not sure\"sad, very very sad\"\"more subdued, pensive. try to be helpful whenever i can, even when unrelated to the events. (i noticed that this might be true more broadly, for example, Canada had a very good year raising $ for their annual Terry Fox run (for cancer). \"\"religion. a particular worldview and set of teachings that leads to one interpretation of the US (as evil, etc), which justified holy war. I can\'t see why someone would be willing to die for this (the hijackers) unless they truly believed they would go on to their reward. \"\"it\'s terrible. I think of the people who died, but more of those who were waiting and hoping to hear from a loved one, and about kids whose parents didn\'t come home.  I worry that this will serve to legitimize prejudice and revenge in the US and elsewhere, because people feel justified.\"\"not sure, but it appears that the organization headed by bin laden (I forget it\'s name) may be involved.\"',4,-5,0,1,5,0,4.8,0,1.2,0,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,7.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,1.2,0,0,22.18,0,0,1.2,14.4,0,0.6,0,3,0,0,5.4,0,56.38,0,4.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,70.18,3.6,0,23.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.6,13.8,1.2,1.2,0,0,4.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,Female49bb
'Many Isalmic fundamentalists believe that the US is decadant and evil and has intruded in Middle-Eastern affairs where it should not.  The fact that we support Israel is also a thorn in their sides.  The presence of the US and Israel and other Western influeces stands in the way of the fundamentalists being able to restore the glory days of Salidin and the Islamic empire.Don\'t go into Manhattan as much. Cancelled a plane trip to Paris.  Keep more in touch with my relatives.  Am more generous and kindly to others.  \"Ben Ladin and the Alqueda terrorist network, probably assisted as well by cells in Iraq.\"\"In a sense, we should have expected attacks on the WTC because of the Middle Eastern conflict, which had been escalating, New York as the capital of commerce, the prominence of the WTC building, its symbolic value, and the high concentration of people that worked there.  Ideal as a target for a terrorist attack.  It had already been bombed once.  Relations with the Islamic world had not been improving. Still, it was an emotional shock of immense magnitude.  I remember hearing of the first attack as I was going to work after having voted in the New York City primary.  I thought it strange that a plane would have missed seeing and avoiding collision with the WTC on a clear day such that it was.  When I heard (on my walkman) of a second blast in the other building, I knew at once it was a terrorist attack. It registered cognitively, but the emotional impact was yet to come--and come in spurts.  When the buildings collapsed it took my breath away.  I thought of all the people who must have died.  I felt largely disbelief and anger.  I talked with others to get more information.  We rigged up a TV at work and watched in silence and horror. The first weekend after the attack, feeling vulnerable as never before, but resolved not to let the terrorist get further satisfaction from shutting down the city, my husband and I attended a play off Broadway for which we had tickets.  The restaurants all around were either empty or half empty, though the show was filled to capacity.  We left early as it was not Sam Sheppard at his best.  The hush over the city and the relative emptiness of Times Square was chilling. We had planned to go to Paris the first two weeks in October, and for a while, still planned to do so.  Then, about 10 days later we cancelled our plans.  It didn\'t seem  right  to go and have a gay time in Paris in light of events here.  As well, the thought of plane travel made me queasy.  We felt tremendous sympathy for all the people and families, and firefighters, who had been affected. I think I have become even more depressed over time, rather than less depressed, perhaps because I tend to use repression to cope with negative events.  I threw myself into my work, and having a grant deadline to prod along, I could distract myself during the day.  In the evening I continued to watch the news and read every bit of newspaper I could get my hands.  Though I have been able to work, I\'ve had a low grade depression, especially this last week--there are American flags adorning cars and homes and stores all over the place, and remnants of candles at various places along the way from the evening vigils.  The city just doesn\'t seem the same.  There is a somberness (and heightened civility) that does not usually characterize New York. I am also anxious about how my country will respond to the terrorist attacks, and apprehensive that there may be backlashes.  \"\"I think that my simple life will be forever changed. I have a son(7 1/2 yrs), I worry how this will effect his life and whether it was a good idea to have children.Relates back to when I was younger,I\'m 45, during the Viet Nam  conflict my friends and I would comment on how unsafe the world was and how we might have a nuclear end, of course it was all hypothetical then,now I\'m not so sure.  On that Tuesday, I wanted to leave work, run home grab my son and animals and just curl up the bedroom and hide. I\'m a registered nurse, so I don\'t think these events will effect my job status, but I do find myself wondering if I should be limiting my spending. I pulled my son and husband to church on Sunday, the first time in years, it seemed like everyone one was trying to make sense of it all. I went to a different service on Friday, the 14th, with my co-workers and just cried. I also find I\'m listenening to the news(radio or TV) constantly for updates, at least, I try to turn it off when my son walks in the room. He seems to be fairly uneffected by this all, not really asking questions. My husband and I lived In Southern Calif. before moving here(a small community in SW New York) right after my son\'s birth, I think he feels safe here. The day it happened my husband and I were both concerns whether he would have heard about it at school. Fortunately  they were nopt exposed to this at school, when he came home my husband sat him down and gave a very basic explanation to him, allowing him to see a little of it on TV. Again because we live in a small community I think my son feels removed from it all. Our neighbor\'s daughter and grandchildren live in Washington DC, about 8miles from the Pentagon, she(the daughter and children) came home this last weekend, the daughter said she couldn\'t take the hellicopters flying at night and sirens, her children age 6 and 5 again, don\'t seen effected by it.    \"I\'m not sure\"I\'m trying to enjoy the simple things I sometimes take for granted, like my family\"\"I find it hard to believe that America is so hated by others, I don\'t know why it was done\"\"It still feels somewhat surreal to think that the Twin Towers are gone. I lived in Jersey City, right across the river from the WTC for several years, and used the WTC PATH station and subway stations to get to/from work for some time during that stay. I remember walking through the underground shopping, coming above ground through 3 WTC (which I understand is also collapsed). There was a  green market  every Thursday in the courtyard outside 3 WTC, and I have a spider plant hanging on my back porch right now that I bought at that green market. There was a park across the street (probably under many feet of rubble now) where people of all ages would gather in the afternoons and play chess and backgammon. Sometimes when the weather was bad and I wanted to kill some time before braving the bus ride from the Jersey City PATH station to my home, I\'d hang out in the Borders Books in 5 WTC. I spent many hours (and lots of dollars!) there. I haven\'t been back to the NYC area since the attacks, and probably won\'t be able to be there for some time, as I have a baby now and travelling has turned into a much bigger production these days. Not having seen it in  real life , only on TV, it still doesn\'t quite seem real. I think part of the problem is that none of the TV cameras have shown the new skyline from the perspective I knew best -- at night, looking across the Hudson from the Jersey City palisades. I think the first time I see it for myself from that vantage point, *that* is when it will finally hit home. The other surreal thing is that, since I used to work as a consultant in the City, some of the companies that lost people in the attacks are former clients. Most notably, I worked for almost a year at Marsh and McLennan, who lost about 300 people. When I worked with them, they were all down at the end of Broad Street, and were just gearing up to move to their spiffy new digs at the WTC. I left before my client department moved. I haven\'t been able to find out if any of the people I worked with are among the missing. I\'m not sure how I\'d feel if I were to find out that they are. My main feeling initially was deep rage at the attackers, especially when I saw that there were young children on those airplanes. I guess having a baby (6 months old next week) has especially sensitized me to the pain of losing one so young. I find myself hoping that the dead attackers are spending all of eternity burning in hell, within sight of Paradise, and that they feel from now until the end of time the full impact of the fear and pain they have caused to innocent people. They have dishonored God and the religion of Islam and deserve the worst punishment that can possibly be meted out. They deserve no mercy, no forgiveness. As an American, I\'m also angry with the Middle Easterners who say that we  got what we deserved . NOBODY deserves anything like this. Aside from the fact that a sizeable number of the missing are from many countries other than the U.S.A. (including several hundred from the Middle East), it is wrong to hold the average American citizen responsible for the policies of the American government. Right now, the Pakistani government is cooperating with the U.S.A. Does this mean that it\'s okay for Middle Eastern terrorists to start killing Pakistani civillians now? Or are they able to recognize that at least some of the Pakistani people disagree with what their government is doing? In other words, do the terrorists recognize a difference between the government and the  man in the street ? And if they can do that for Pakistan, why cannot they do it for the U.S.? As a person of faith (although not a person of any fixed religion -- I generally identify myself as a  Zen Lutheran  when forced to answer), I am also quite angry at the terrorists, the Afghan Taliban, and other Middle Eastern governments for their selective misreading of the Qur\'an as justification for their mysogyny, warmongering, and other totally un-Muslim acts. Islam is an honorable and peaceful religion, superior to Christianity in some respects (status of women, treatment of opponents in war), which has been cruelly misused and twisted to fit the personal agendas of countless petty tyrants, particularly in the Middle East. They have used  creating misreading  of the Qur\'an to justify the continuation of cultural practices that are, in fact, flatly in opposition to both the letter and spirit of Islamic law. I find this reprehensible. I am also troubled by the U.S. media\'s inability to accurately convey this situation to the American public. They continue to label bin Laden and his ilk as  Islamic fundamentalists , when they are no more  fundamentalist  (in the sense of  getting back to the basics of the religion ) than white supremacists are  Christian fundamentalists . The media continues to equate Middle Eastern with Muslim, when in fact the largest Muslim country in the world is Indonesia, and the people of the Middle East belong to a host of religions, just as the people of the U.S. do. It would be much more accurate to simply refer to these animals as  terrorists  or even  Middle Eastern militants .  Islamic fundamentalists , however, is totally inaccurate and does a disservice to *real* devout Muslims the world over. Part of me wants the terrorists who are still left alive to be captured and turned over to the most sadistic criminally insane people we can find, to be killed slowly and in as much excruciating pain as a sick mind can devise. The larger part of me, though, is appalled at this streak of vindictiveness. And I realize in my more rational moments that it would probably be greater torture to capture them and keep them alive, prevent them from making any statements or otherwise further spreading their poison in the world, and force them to watch, over and over, videos of rallys and prayer meetings and all the other evidence that their attempts to tear us apart have in fact brought us closer together. That, and I think someone\'s suggestion that they should be forced, every minute of every day of their remaining lives, videos and home movies of birthdays, christenings, holiday parties, etc. of the people they killed. Over and over and over and over... Guess I\'m more vindictive than I thought, after all...\"\"Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organization, and their supporters in the Afghani Taliban\"\"Not much at all, really. Where I live is not really a prime target (too rural and sparsely populated to make the kind of impact terrorists typically seem to want), and I didn\'t go into the nearby cities much even before the attacks.\"\"In the case of bin Laden, it\'s a cynical ploy to increase his own wealth and personal power. He tries to cloak it in the mantle of  Islamic jihad  but this is a misuse of both the term  jihad  and of the commands and tenets of the Qur\'an.\"I feel that I need to try to get all I can out of life and be more aware of my friends and family.\"I am truly afraid for our people and our country.  I feel that this is close to the end of the line.  These people are ruthless and obviously don\'t care about anyone\'s feelings.  If I had to guess, I\'d say this is just the beginning and we have a lot of horror to look forward to.  I hate it for my children because they\'ve never experienced anything so harsh.\"Bin Laden and AssociatesWho in the hell could guess!!\"My perspective of the world has honestly changed.  I now feel as if things can not be taken for granted.  This tragedy has also allowed me to re-examine myself and my current lifestyle and to stop doing things in which I do not gain happiness from.  I now have a plan of action to start making a difference in my own life since I realize how truly prcious life really is.

'\"Firstly, I think the events of september 11th were abhorent and in no way justified.  I am actually getting quite sick of people saying that what happened was in some way deserved due to unfair and intolerant foreign policy (which may or may not be the case). I don\'t care what the reasons were, theres no excuse for killing innocent people, its nothing less than mass murder.  There may be issues with american foreign policy, and american domination of the world and the arrogance that is shown by americans all over the world.  But this makes no difference to what happened.  Theres absolutely nothing anyone could possibly have done which would warrant an attack like the one that took place. I find it sick that humans could have thought up and carried out such an inhumane act.  To spend a good year plotting something and living amongst the people you were planning to kill is incomprehensible.  What kind of mind must these people have?  I understand the islam religion to a certain extent and these extremists beliefs that by killing themselves in the name of islam, they will somehow go straight to heaven and all their sins will be forgiven etc.  Without getting subjective, what a load of crap.  People who can do that have no respect for what it means to have human life.  And, to people who are talking of miliatary action, i think that there is no choice.  There are anti-war  demonstrators saying that miliatary action is wrong, and any military action will just lead to more disillusionment in the middle east and ultimately more terrorists. So, do we sit back and wait for it to happen again?  Theres no reasoning with terrorists. i\'ve heard muslims on television saying that war against bin laden is war against them.  Killing him would be killing them.  So, these people are muslims before being humans?  How can they say that killing/capturing a dangerous mass murderer is wrong when he has instigated the killing of thousands of humans, regardless of their religion.  These people are fucked up.  They don\'t live in the same world as the rest of us.  They live in a world that has no respect for people, where they think its acceptable to celebrate the deaths of thousands of innocent people (the tv reports from palestine after the sept 11 events) and burning pictures of bush.  I\'m not a great fan of bush myself, but celebrating death etc is not the way civilized humans behave.  We have evolved (whether you want to believe it or not, its fact, no arguments) to be intelligent, reasonable and social beings, at a level above our lesser (and i don\'t mean less important) beings.  We have evolved brains that enable us to rationalize actions and emotions and not act on instinct.  Thats what wild animals do, because they don\'t have the brain capacity to do anything else.  They don\'t feel sorry when they hunt and kill or hurt, because thats their brains do not allow them to empathise - ours do, thats because we are so much more evolved.  So, I wonder then, what kind of cretins are these people who are capable of such evil? Do they have the same brains as us?  Are they so weak that they are brainwashed by evil and not strong enough to resist?  Or did something go wrong in the development of their brains that made them unable to empathize and to make them capable of wreaking such horror on fellow human beings, regardless of religion.  All in all, people who are capable of carrying out such acts, i don\'t believe they have the empathy and feeling of the majority of human beings, and so i dont\' believe they should be treated  humans.  A cause and a belief is understandable, but we have developed brains that have endowed us with language and reasoning and social skills that mean we can sort out and work on resolutions to our conflicts without resorting to animalistic behaviour.  The worst thing is that animals are not aware of the pain and suffering their fighting and killing may cause, as humans, these terrorists were.  \"\"Al Queda, Bin Laden and possibly Iraq\"\"Because they are sick, believe they have a cause that justifies the ends, and because some humans are weak enough to be brainwashed by bullshit\"\"I\'ve paid much more attention to the news, become less tolerant of humans in general, become less tolerant of religion and become more interested in international relations.\"madness\"i am profoundly sad about the loss of life as we knew it and for those who are suffering directly for the loss of life. i am not angry but am determined to see that the first act of humans in this new world is to support the eradication of terrorism (indiscriminate killing of civilians) throughout the world, to see that it is never under any circumstance accepted as a justifiable means to an end. i am hopeful that the end result of this earthwide trauma is a more just world where we act with more respect for human life and relations everywhere.\"\"it is more difficult to get on with work and life, to relax enough to be intimate. have moved through fear of the future, that things might or might not happen as i want them too - they matter little. i have some hope that this international alliance will last and lead to greater understanding of others.\"mad men; religious zealots\"I have prayed much more. I have attended more church services in my search for answers. These answers are all found in God\'s living word, The Holy Bible.  \"\"Satan is the mastermind of all evil but without men with sickened minds, he cannot succeed.  I definitely believe that bin Laden and probably other leaders were responsible for this and I pray for their souls.\"See above\"I have felt an overwhelming sense of desperation sense the Sept 11 attacks. My desperation is probably somewhat different than others.  I did not personally know any of the victims and am not originally from any of the areas that were attacked.  To me this is much more than a simple terrorist attack.  There are many dimensions to this event that I feel most people do not comprehend.  It is a declaration of war on the US on our own continental soil.  It is an attack on freedom and democracy from a group that despises them both. Most importantly, it is an attack of evil on that which is good-specifically, this is the work of Satan against God and his creations. Having said that most people tune me out; and this adds to my sense of desperation.  While I don\'t believe that this was the work of God\'s hand, I do believe that He has somewhat lifted his protection from this country.  And why shouldn\'t He?  Our nation was founded upon the very beliefs and faith in God that is now forbidden in our schools and other public places.   In conclusion, I do not think that the state of the world will ever be any better than it is today.  A whirlwind of violence that picks up force as it goes will continue to challenge the good in this world until our Father finally decides to end Satan\'s assault on the earth.  This may add to the desperation of many.  But friend, I have the hope of all hopes because I have the strength that comes with the knowledge that Jesus Christ reigns supreme and interceeds for me and my country with my God.  I fervently pray for the repentance of this nation and its people.  Despite all our efforts to squash terrorism, they will be futile if we do not acknowledge our sins as a country and seek the face of God.  We must humble ourselves both individually and as a nation.  Pride, we know, is the most hated of all sins by God. I pray that all who read this will contemplate what I have said and turn to Jesus, the only true comfort in this universe!\"Probably because they are upset with our country and/or government for one reason or another.\"I think that this has been an unexpainably horrible tragedy, but I think that it has brought Americans together in a way that I have never seen in my nineteen years of life here.  I am deeply sorrowed for all the victims and their families, for all of New York City, and I can only hope that this nation can stand strong and rebuild itself in this awful time of trouble.  In all, I believe that IN GOD WE TRUST and so we shall!!\"\"I definitely am more interested and involved in the news, trying to keep up-to-date with what\'s going on,  and I feel more patriotic towards my country.\"Osama bin laden and his followers\"Someone might do this to prove that they may feel stronger than our government. They may be jealous and what to create devestation for our country. Obviously, they wanted thousands people to be killed or affected by this. So they really must hate our country.\"\"I am a college student, with a lot of work to be done. I have not been able to concentrate as well lately. I have been really moody and just somber. Tears start to fall whenever I see anything that has to do with the attacks. I just think it will be awhile to adjust to what inevitably happened. \"\"I would assume bin Laden, but I feel that we should not jump to conclusions until a formal investigation is made. \"\"I. like so many other Americans, feel completely heart-broken and even helpless over last week\'s attack. I cannot even imagine being in the situations these people were forced into being. I have put myself in everyone\'s shoes trying to imagine the pain and the fear they must have gone through. I know that what I felt is not even close to what these innocent people had to go through. I have cried days on end, listening to all the terrible personal stories in the news. My heart and prayers are truley with those family members. It is sad to say, but I am glad that I do not know anyone that is directly involved in the attacks last week. However, these people were all Americans, and that is what I am so I grieve for them. They did not deserve to go through what they did and either do their families. It has truley been a somber week for me. I do know that this will all make us better in the end however. Our country will survive and will stand tall, and I feel that every American will take every bit of effort to see that we grow from this horrible experience. \"',3,-4,0,2,5,0,4.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.38,0,13.13,0,0,0,0,3.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.09,4.38,0,1.09,1.09,1.09,0,1.09,5.47,0,0,0,1.09,0,1.09,0,0,27.34,0,4.93,0,0,0,0,1.09,0,43.2,5.47,0,1.09,0,0,0,1.09,0,1.09,0,0,0,0,0,7.65,12.58,0,0,1.09,0,3.83,0,0,0,0,3.28,0,0,1.09,0,0,1.09,Female49bb
'\"I watch even less TV. I may look for some bargain airfares; after all. denial has its uses. (I\'m afraid that my usual defense of graveyard humor may seem inappropriate, but I too feel helpless to change anything, so I need to go on as ususal.)\"\"Hatred usually comes from feeling helpless while being humiliated I think, and I believe this made those carrying it out feel very powerful. \"\"As I had no one I knew who was harmed, I believe my perspective is able to be more dispassionate than if I had lost someone. I learned of the incident when my second psychiatric patient of the day came in and told me about it at her 10:00 am appointment. She was quite upset, but not as overwhelmed as I observed others to be later in the day. I believe this was because she heard about it in the radio and had not been following every minute on TV. The other patients I saw or heard from later in the day were much more upset, and, I believe, she became more so later on. Two patients cancelled, one saying she was too frightened to leave her house and going on about a nuclear power plant that she said was nearby. Another patient, one with significant PTSD post heart transplant also cancelled because he was  too bummed out to go anywhere.  He continues to struggle with the images of tall strong buildings being tumbled by a bolt ftom the blue.(He is a tall, strong man, whose cardiac condition came on suddenly in his 30\'s and he was,indeed, struck down by a bolt from the blue.) I went to that part of my head that doctors are trained to go to in an emergency and put feelings on hold as much as I could. I had no access to a TV throughout the day. That night. as I had to finish and fax out a court report to aid in sentencing for another patient. I made the decision not to turn on the TV until the morning. I was afraid I would not be able to sleep otherwise, and I had to be ready to help others process the event the next day.  The next morning before going to work I turned on the TV and saw those horrible images that I had protected myself from the day before. I had had on the radio in my office waiting room, and with 2 cancellations, plenty of time to listen to the news. Even knowing what I would be seeing and distancing myself from the images until I chose the time and circumstances under which I would look at them, I still was stunned and burst into tears when I saw the film taken of the second airliner crashing into the tower. I allowed the tears and then had to choke them off to go to work. I was to find my voice breaking at times during the next few days when the subject came up, and again when I learned that a cousin, who I did not know worked at the Pentagon on occsssion, had left the building minutes before the strike there. I\'m a bit of a gueezer, I guess, but I think the assasinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King had more impact on me. I was in high school with the first and in college with the second. I truly mourned Martin Luther King and feared for our country tremendously in the days and nights that followed. I still think our soul , if a country can be said to have a soul, was far more endangered then, when it appeared that we might turn on each other, and citizens would kill other citizens because of their differing color. I am much more optimistic that we will survive this with our spirit renewed instead of tattered. That will depend, of course, on the number and size of any future incidents. We will perhaps be worn down, as terror is designed to do, but I am encouraged by the relative absence of anti-Arab activity that we have seen, certainly it has been nothing compared to the riots and curfews after King died.  From what I have observed of my patients, those who were working and could not stay glued to the TV did better. I had to finally be quite directive with some of my patients and tell them to turn it off and go out of their house, as they seemed to be getting more and more upset and more home-bound by watching the television. I have beem no friend of television for many years. However, I think the networks were a truly malignant influence on those who watched too much of it after this incident. Denial has its uses; we did not need to see that crash over and over. The pictures of the rescue workers doing their job were useful and gave hope, but the constant repitition of the crashes had no point but sensationalism.\"I would put as much blame on our policy in the Middle East as on the terrorists. If we were to  bomb  Afganistan with food packages as we did in the Berlin airlift we could perhaps do some good in cutting off the roots that feed the hatred.\"My husband worked in The Custums Bldg [#6]WTC and it was a horrific and indescribable feeling not know ing for hours that seemed like decades where and how he was.

My heart brakes fro the tens of thousands of family, friends and pets of the probably close to 7000 now that have lost their lives senslessly in this crime against humanity.\"\"I cry periodically when I think ,what if...\"\"criminals. cold-hearted, uncaring animals trying to force their beliefs on the world at large. fanatics, terrorists. more then likely connected to bin Laden &/or Hussain and others\"see aboveI have become more interested in following the news and feel more patriotic than I ever have.Osloma bin Laden and his followersBecause they are angry with our country/govt.\"To tell the truth, at first, I felt like none of it had happened.  The images on television were almost unreal.  The reality of just how tragic the event was didn\'t quite hit me until I actually watched the first tower collapse and saw the people\'s reaction in New York.  I remember thinking,  Oh my God, this is bigger than anything that has ever happened in the nineteen years I have been alive.  This is going to go down in history as a national tragedy.  My fellow students will be teaching this some day to their students.   I feel great pain for all of the victims and their families.  I cannot begin to imagine how much suffering and greif they have felt.  I have felt some fear, but mainly sorrow for those who lost their lives.  I don\'t think I have ever felt so proud to be a citizen of this country as I do now.  I am in awe of how well America has come together as one and how strong of a nation we look like in other\'s eyes.  I can only hope that things will someday go back to living in peace, only this time, being more united as a country.  I think that we are well on our way to that picture.\"\"Bin Laden\'s network, however he is merely a minion, He is the zealot who has raised the ferver of the guerrillas...Bin Laden is not necessarily the brains!\"The terrorists hate America for backing Israel\"We, Americans, have put up with some form of terrorism or another for since Sirhan Sirhan shot Bobby Kennedy in 1968.  This attack on September 11, 2001 has hopefully gotten the full attention of our nation and our leaders.  I hate to think that if we attack Bin Laden, or Arafat, or Hussein there may be loss of innocent life, however, we have already had plenty of loss of innocent life!  This time let the innocent life be on their continent, not here in America.  they violated us, our nation, our way of life......GAME ON!!\"\"Me, I hang my flag higher, but I have always hung a flag at my home.

I try to keep from forming prejudices against those of Middle Eastern descent as well. As this quest for justice endures, I pray that I can keep an open mind and heart for everyone. My deepest feelings are anxiety and fear. I am scared for the first time in my lifetime of harm because of who I am -- an American. Those feelings are life altering and change everything.

'Ignorance and selfishness\"I really don\'t know what to think.  It is hard to grasp something so horrid.  I have no direct relations to any of the victims but find myself in tears hearing the stories of those lost and mourning.

I talk more with my neighbors and strangers than I used to (again, I always did).  There is just a greater need now.\"\"The events of September 11 are haunting.  Living near Seattle, you\'d think it wouldn\'t have a profound effect on me, but it has. I first heard it on the radio while getting ready to go to my job...teaching 7th and 8th grade students. For lack of better words, when I heard what happened, I found it an  ordinary  coverage of news events.  It didn\'t really occur to me what had happened and what had been lost.  Then, after the hit on the Pentagon, the radio station, which I listen to because it\'s a fun, humerous way to start the day, said the Lord\'s Prayer.  That move made me realize what was REALLY happening.  I cried and called my husband to tell him the news and that I loved him.  I couldn\'t dwell on this for long, however, because I had to teach that day, so I got ready, immediately turned on the radio in my car and tried to find the words, the way, to express this event to my students.   When I arrived at school, we had a faculty meeting, but we were all watching the live coverage in our school library.  This is the first I\'d SEEN it.  The coverage had people jumping to their death.  I needed to cry, but I couldn\'t.  Our principle told us we could watch the coverage for a few minutes each period, but that the discussion was what he wanted the focus on. In first period, I gave a brief explanation and turned on the TV.  The first thing we saw was the towers going down.  The first thing I heard from them was  cool.   The TV was turned off.  I told them this is cool if it was a movie, cool if it was a special effect, but not cool when you realize it\'s real and nearly 50,000 people and their families worked in those buildings.  That\'s 50,000 mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandpas, and grandpas that may have died.   As the day progressed and news got worse, my students and I talked about military families and students with relatives across the country.  The feeling was of respect.  Only one student did not show reverence and he was quickly halted by the piercing looks from others and the firmness of this need from me. I\'m sharing what my students did, because their reactions melded mine for the first week.  They wrote on the tragedy.  Everything from violence against the person(s) responsible to wishing they\'d died instead of someone elses family member...especially moms and dads who had children to go home to.  They felt the need of those children who in one day became orphans. It wasn\'t until Friday that it really started to hit me personally instead of professionally.  We had the moment of silence at school...956 students and all staff went outside on the track and faced the flagpole at half mast.  The local fire department had it\'s sirens going during the minute proceeding.  Then we had the moment.  Afterwards, the whole group said the pledge of allegence.  My eyes welled up with tears, even as I write this over a week later.  Yet, I couldn\'t REALLY cry.  My students were watching my every movement, gesture, and comment...looking for strength themselves.  It was overwhelming. That night, news had been flooded at us for nearly one week.  My husband and I rented two brainless comedies to forget.  It felt good to laugh, but foreign at the same time.  When planes go overhead, especially since so many are military due to our proximity to the military bases on the coast, I cringe and can\'t help looking outside to see if everything is alright. Early the following week (I think it was Monday) I had a day of being dingy.  I would ask my students a question, wanting an answer, but being unable to concentrate on their responses.  I don\'t know how many times that I had to have them repeat things.  With my husband, it was the same thing.  I just couldn\'t focus.  I\'ve had those moments in my life, but not those days.  It was very frustrating. We thought life would return back to normal the first day the Mariners went back to doing what they do the best.  I\'ve never followed a team like this, and was very excited about the game.  We sat down to watch and cried and their opening ceremonies.  At this point, even my husbands eyes got moist.  The show of patriotism and unity is something I\'ve never experienced before.  I couldn\'t believe we were in that stadium under normal circumstances just a week prior for Cal Ripken\'s last game.  I get the feeling we\'ll never be the same.   Opening ceremonies are through, and the game begins.  I found myself cheering for Ichiro to make it to first.  I stopped short because cheering felt so foreign and somehow so wrong.  Knowing this is an irrational belief, I try to keep cheering.  Then I feel incredible empathy for those trying to play this game when they must have some of those same emotions. I\'m still fearful.  I\'ve never experienced the real fear of war or a draft.  Planes still bother me when I hear them, although I\'ll fly again.  I think they\'re as secure as they\'ve been in a long time.  I\'ve lost some very precious people in my lifetime, so I\'ve always been more thankful and realize the importance of little things.  This has changed even my husband, though.  Now he realizes how important those three words are, as are hugs every day.  I notice my neighbors are more friendly since this happened.  Prayer is finding it\'s way back into lives of people.  Church is more important.  This is another thing that helps my personal mentality on life. I\'ve taught middle school 4 years, and it wasn\'t until yesterday that one of my students asked me if I believe in God.  (touchy issue at school)  I said that I did.  She asked my religion and I told her.  Then I asked hers.  She seemed relieved to have a teacher that believes.  Somehow it must have been a validation to her that she\'s okay to be herself with me. I believe that our president is doing a good job.  I pray for him and his advisors.  I also have learned to pray for the people who did this...knowing they need it more than anyone.  I\'m not a religious fanatic...just and average person who has seen more hope out of desperation than I ever would have believed possible. I\'m currently making quilts for victims and a flag for myself.  Doing something helps the healing for me.   Good luck with your study.\"\"Someone would do this because they felt they were on a mission from God and that it was right.  Also, they might do this to force the USA into noticing them and their ideals.  This may be done to help the terrorist missions around the world gain allies.

But I do believe it was an act against the whole world by a handfull of misguided people.\"Our first reaction was shock, folowed by a feeling of numbness and then panic to see if we had any friends or relatives in the WTC\'s. After frantic phone calls, and to have everyone accounted for there was relief and then guilt. I have felt the whole gamut of emotions. Anger, lots of it at the stupidity of these fanatics, helplessness and guilt. Also relief that my friend and family are safe.\"I feel my personal problems are very small. I also feel very sorry for the average people who are caught in crossfire.I refuse to speculate without knowing all the facts.  I have not kept update with the media.\"I feel more connected to my fellow Americans and to history.  It is as if I have finally lived because something tragic and tremendous has happened in my life time that I am aware of (i.e. for others the Depression, civil rights, WWI, WWII, etc.).  But I guess none of this is really related to my behavior, except that I am more sure of myself and as a member of society; that is, my voice counts and has merit.\"There are two sides to every coin.  I think someone wanted our attention and they got it.\"I find that everyday, in fact every hour, my feelings regarding the whole situation changes.  At times I feel very patriotic and aggressive, while at other times I am simply saddened.  Most of all I am shocked that the events really did occur-it seemed so surreal.  Just hearing about it (plane crashes and buildings) was odd, but actually seeing the crashes on T.V. was quite numbing.  I was relieved that I still had feelings though, because I often feel desensitized to tragedies that don\'t involve people I directly know.  I find it a little unsettling and a bit upsetting to listen or hear about people\'s last words to their loved ones.  These are quite new feelings for me. I also worry about how we intend to counter this aggressive, well thought out, and quite destructive attack.  I am afraid of more innocent people being hurt or blamed.  There is no easy solution.  I hate to be political about this, but I have a difficult time tolerating President Bush.  I think he is very embarassing and will try to use this situation to make himself look better.

And then, when it became more real, as I heard it on the radio, rather than over the telephone, and as I heard that the Pentagon had also been hit, I felt like our nation was under attack.  Then, of course, I wanted to reassure myself that everyone in my family was safe.  So I called my mother to find out what time my aunt, uncle, and cousin were supposed to take off from California.  I was trying to make sure they were not on one of the ill-fated planes.  We didn\'t know at that time exactly where all of the airplanes had taken off from.  I was relieved that my family was only supposed to arrive on the East coast at 8 p.m. that evening, so I felt reassured that they were not on one of the four planes that crashed that day, and I felt a real sense of relief, and then the need to communicate this information to others in my family who might also be worried.

I\'m sorry that all those people lost their lives and pray daily for the families remaining which has to be almost intolerable.  But I think the way that America has come together; the way other countries of the world including our enemies are supporting us is just \'out of this world.\'  This terrible tragedy may be the best thing that has ever happened to the United States, notwithstanding that people here have suffered much.

Let\'s think about what group commits most violent acts against doctors who perform abortions...and yet, the media does not typically villanize Christianity for this.  The violence is the result of self-serving motives all under the auspice of religious zeal.\"\"I received an interdepartment email that you are doing this study.

It is a long email I won\'t feel like I am just repeating that email.  If this is acceptable, please email me and identify yourself and I will forward it to you.

My sadness is obviously in response to the incredible acts of cruelty, but my sympathy and compassion is really more toward those who lost loved ones.  \"Terrorists sponsored by Islamic organization(s) that promote violence and have managed to create a scapegoat with broad appeal.\"It seems strange to me to say this, but my long-term feelings about Sept. 11 have been relatively numb.  On September 11, I heard about the attacks shortly after they occurred, and my emotions were primarily a mixture of shock, fear and rage.  The feelings were less intense over the next several months and have been replaced by a more general sense of wariness about my surroundings.  I don\'t find myself directing it at any particular types of people, though. Perhaps because of media coverage of the sociocultural life in Afghanistan, I have become very disturbed by the fact that these atrocious acts of violence, oppression and hate have all been committed or commissioned by men.  I am more inclined to think of men as predators of women and innocents, and this view applies to situations beyond those related to 9/11. Plane trips also remain very stressful for me (I\'ve taken approximately ten flights since 9/11) and sometimes I feel as though I could kill anyone who tried to disrupt the flight with my bare hands.  Just thinking about a hijacker trying to take over my flight generates a feeling of rage inside me.  Though I don\'t believe in the death penalty, I feel that I would have no qualms about administering my own  justice  if I had the opportunity to face a terrorist.\"\"I have become afraid of flying (though I still do fly), and I am much more aware of current events now than before.\"\"Some people who are full of hurt and anger, who feel disenfranchised and weak, will accept the promises, praise and dogma of a charismatic leader.\"\"I find myself much better at dealing with anxiety, with which I have struggled over the past 3 years or so. I face things with more courage and strength and objectivity. I am more cynical about the media than ever, which I feel has been treating the public like a bunch of cattle and has been making big bucks off of people\'s fears and vulnerabilities. I have even more of an appreciation for the fact that knowledge is power.\"\"I think the primary characteristic of my thoughts regarding the  events of September 11th  (Odd, isn\'t it, that we don\'t have a more descriptive name for what happened? I have been calling it a bombing interchangeably with a tragedy, but often fall back to  events , myself.) is dynamism. At first, I was enraged by what happened, but even in those initial hours when everything was unfolding I empathized with the frustration and anger that many Middle Easterners must feel as a result of US policy. (Not that this, of course, justifies the action taken.) Watching the coverage of the events, I felt horribly horribly sad and, having experienced anxiety at a rather personal level in my life, felt very plugged in to how the passengers on the planes and the people in the WTC and Pentagon must have felt. How trapped, how confused, how helpless, how out of control, how frightened. I cried off and on for days. I could picture it all in detail. I cancelled a trip to Germany that my fiance and I had planned as a holiday for the following week. But even rocks change, and so have my feelings. I am no longer afraid to travel. I am irritated by the emoting and sensationalism the media has made out of the event. I feel hopeful that our government will do the right thing and not start dropping bombs just to make us feel better. I am fascinated by the effect of the events on the global economy, foreign policy, travel, and even interpersonal relationships. I feel more connected to humanity at the same time as I have been deeply troubled and disgusted by it. I am a part of this. Somewhere inside I have the same potentiality for good and evil. I have been lucky. Vulnerability is not so scary anymore. People have commented on how they cannot look at things the same, that you never know if the people you see or buildings you work in are going to be there tomorrow. This has always been the case, only now we are realizing it as a society. How many cancer patients, war veterans, rape victims, hurricane survivors etc. have had this same realization? How have they dealt with it? Perhaps we can turn to their positive examples in order to deal with our own feelings of vulnerability. I feel that a lot of positive change will come out of the terrorist attacks on our country. I know I have changed for the better, for the stronger. This weekend, my fiance and I will go to NYC to help  rebuild the economy . Sometimes, when you are anxious, it\'s nice to just know that other people are there. We can just be there this weekend, and hopefully that will bring comfort to someone that things will be ok not by denying vulnerability but by sharing it. Oh, one last thing, I am disturbed by all of this  God Bless America  chanting. I am a believer in God, raised a Roman Catholic (still practicing, generally), and I understand the need to  turn to God  when times are confusing, but it all feels like intellecutally empty propaganda to whip up nation-wide support. We need to think hard about what we\'ve done to cause problems in the Middle East, and what we\'ve done  in the name of God  on our own soil. I think if we did, we\'d be horrified, and we\'d think twice about saying such things. Well, that\'s my ramble. I hope this helps your investigation.\"\"Oh, I don\'t know. Another difficult answer. It sounds like somebody really wanted to get a point across. They also probably wanted to bring about an inbalance in our economy and create fear. I keep wanting to answer the question  How could someone do this? , but that would be like trying to dig a hole in the ocean.\"\"That is not an easy answer. Primarily, the terrorists who executed the attack and the people who helped them are responsible. They are the ones who need to be brought to justice and punished to the full extent of the law. However, our unfair policies in the Middle East could have had some very strong indirect effects on what happened. After all, if the terrorists wanted to attack somebody, why not Bolivia? Or Sudan? I think there was a reason they picked the US and, ultimately, nobody\'s hands are clean.\"The TalibanI am definitely more aware of what is going on in our  country.  I am also more patriotic as are the people I go to school with.  We are all in support of what  the US is doing for us.I think that the events of September 11th are tragic and something needs to be done  about them.  These are things that ruin a country and I do not want to see ours get  ruined because of this.  I am glad that we are taking action and going over there to  find out who did this and make them pay. because they think that the way we do things in our country are not the way that things should be done and they want us to change and do things the way that they want them done\"I trust my country and President when he says it was the Talaban, but I don\'t know if I want to set that into stone.  Right now I hold Binladan and the Talaban responsible.  But I also hold everyone who wished this upon us responsible too.\"\"I feel that what happened on Sept 11th is exceedingly tragic.  I also feel very lucky that I didn\'t have anyone I directly know die.  I do know people who have been affected greatly, and it is unbelievable to think about what they could be going through.   I\'m very scared about what is going to come.  I think we should fight and defend ourselves.  I think if we just sit back and take the approach of being kind and not retalliating, we will be sending the wrong message.  I most definately don\'t think we should take what has happened to us lightly.  We need to tell the world that we will not tolerate what has happened, and let everyother country know that if they attempt this, the ramifications will not be pleasant.  I personally would feel alot better if we bomb, fight, or take whatever military action necessary to disable the talaban to great extent.  I don\'t like the thought of war; it means my friends will be fighting.  But, I also think that it is necessary at times, and this might be one of those times. I don\'t know what I would do if I was a direct victim of this horrifing tragedy.  I don\'t think that it is right to blame all Afganastaies, but I can see why this thought comes about.  Some people lost everyone they loved, and I can\'t even imagine how great their pain and anger must be.  I hope that these people can eventually come out this better people, and learn to trust again because trust is a very important thing.  I also hope our country can pull through this victoriously, and will as little pain as possible.  Everyday I wonder if in a few months some of my friends may not be here, but fighting or dying in another country.  I hope this doesn\'t happen, but I understand if it does, and will support whatever decision Bush makes.\"\"They do not agree with our lifestyle and views, and they do not understand that difference doesn\'t mean that someone has to be bad.  They also only see things onesided.  People who do this type of thing don\'t try to see what those they hate are really about and really trying to accomplish.  It all boils down to hatred and stupidity.\"\"I am alot more patriotic because I see a huge need to be.  I also respect those willing to fight for our country alot more.

'To discourage US involvement in Middle Eastern affairs; to demoralize the members of this country; disagreements about fundamental rights and practices.\"Middle Eastern Terrorists, possibly part of Osama Bin Laden\'s network.\"00Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist network\"We live in a suburb of New York City, from which many people commute to downtown Manhattan.  My husband, thankfully, works some 4 miles north of the WTC, and so was never in any danger.  Many neighbors and friends, however, were directly affected by the attack.  Most significantly, we lost one neighbor/friend who was on the 104th floor of the WTC.  He called his wife from his desk minutes before the building collapsed, so there is really no hope that he could have gotten out.  (As an aside, Arlington, VA is my hometown, so the Pentagon attack also hit close to home -- literally and figuratively). If we\'d lost our neighbor to a car accident, we would have been greatly saddened.  If we\'d been aware of the WTC attack but had not known anyone killed, we would also have been greatly saddened.  The combination of the two experiences was really overwhelming in this first week following the attack.  I couldn\'t help thinking over and over about what he must have experienced, and what his wife and two young children (2 year old boy and 4 month old girl) have in store for them.  Since our children are about the same age, and since my husband also works in New York, it is easy to put myself in their shoes. I haven\'t been able to help my neighbor very much yet, since she\'s been surrounded by family and closer friends.  I hope to be of more help as the immediate tide of support ebbs and she\'s still grieving and needing help.  I also hope that the emotions we\'ve experienced will be fresh enough in a month or two so that we do something positive for our community then -- again, once the initial wave of support has lessened. I\'m not really afraid for my own safety or that of my children.  My husband, who has seen the WTC wreckage first-hand, is afraid for his own safety and for ours.  Life is actually returning to some semblance of normal now -- we still have to do laundry, get groceries, and see friends.  But perhaps life seems a little more fleeting now, and the future a little less rosy.\"\"I worry more and am more likely to make offers of help to others.  My own behavior hasn\'t changed much, though.\"\"Jealousy of the US way of life, and anger over our pervasive culture and our lack of support for people suffering in the middle east other than the Israelis.\"\"I\'ve been morbidly transfixed by stories in the electronic media (e.g, CNN, MSNBC, NPR), and can\'t seem to get enough information.  I\'ve had animated discussions and e-mail exchanges with friends who don\'t necessarily see things the way I do.  I\'ve signed and passed on an electronic petition (urging an alternative response to war), to which some recipients (friends) have taken exception.  I\'ve not been sleeping all that well.  I\'ve been distracted and upset in a vague, general sort of way.\"\"I don\'t know.  I really don\'t know.  Responsibility  comes in many forms, from proximal to distal, from causally to morally.  The question of responsibility is too complex for me to wrap my mind around just yet.\"\"Ultimately, for some self-interested reason, although because I don\'t know for sure who did it or why, I won\'t speculate on just what kind of self-interest (martyrdom, political power, revenge, etc.) was involved.\"\"Horror, incredulity, anger, confusion, compassion and sympathy were all feelings evoked in the immediate aftermath of the WTC and Pentagon attacks, pretty much in that order. Over these last many days, the targets of my anger and contempt have grown in number, and I find myself increasingly angry at the political elite in our country, who over the course of decades have formulated and acted on policy that has sewn the seeds of mistrust, fear, and hatred of the United States--pretty much all over the world (save for Western Europe, of course). The  war  between the  have\'s  and  have-nots  on planet earth has finally arrived within our nation\'s borders. A fear that too much has gone before, and that there is no longer a just or righteous or moral response that the United States can make now.  \"Bin Laden and his followers\"I watch the news more, listen to NPR, and discuss the events.  I think I have a better worldview.\"\"I\'m not sure how good a perspective I have on the events of September 11th.  I rememeber hearing about the WTC collapse and the events of the rest of that day, even that week.  However, I don\'t feel that I have a good idea on what this means for perspective.  I used to think that no one would or could attack the United States in such a powerful way.  I always assumed since we are the  most powerful nation in the world  that this type of thing could never happen.  Realizing our vulnerability, I think, is a good thing.  I enjoyed seeing how the country came together to show our patriotism.  However, I think many people are being terribly bigoted and ignorant about the whole thing.  (i\'m not necessarily excluding myself)  It have a lot of pride in my country, but that does not mean I think our country is better than every other country on Earth.  It seems like we are force fed this information and expected to agree.  I also think it is terrible to see how people of other nationalities who live in the United States are being affected.  People of all different races are being prejudiced to others whom they assume are Afgani and therefore have something to do with the events.  My best friend, who\'s father happens to be Indian, is constantly being harassed on the street.  Even if she was Afgani, does that mean she agrees with the terrorists?  Do we agree with the opinions of every US citizen?  Obviously not.  It is one thing to come together as a nation to show support for all those who continue to suffer from the events of 9/11 and defend our country.  But it is another to  strike back  as the news headlines read, with hate.  Hate is why hundreds are dead and injured and missing.  I think people need to be informed of why Bin Laden and his followers hate us in the first place.  Or are they just  BAD  people who do that kind of thing when they run out of grafitti.  I\'m am not condoning in anywya their behavior, merely stating that the media has too much control over what American citizens do and do not know.  Of course we are harming innocent civilains when we bomb Afganistan.  Even if there was no human error and we had perfect bombs that only targeted the terrorists...  guess what?  The terrorists are the only ones with money to have protection against bombs, but as long as we are not personally affected by all the citizens dying over there, and as long as we don\'t show their pictures on the news and talk about what great lives they had before their terrible death and how their smile used to light up the room,  no one seems to give a damn, now THAT is  BAD .\"\"revenge, to show they have power\"\"I was deeply stired by the event. My heart went out to all the friends and families that lost someone special to them. I couldn\'t even imagine how they felt when they found out that the person they loved died in such a tragic way. I also feel so bad for the passangers aboard the plane that was hijacked.  To know that you have to give your life for a cause that you don\'t support would be terrible. The anger and saddness that must have been going throught the passangers minds as they appoached the Trade Center or the Pentagon knowing that there was nothing they could do. All I can say is that I\'m proud to be an American and I\'m so proud of the way that so many people have come together to help those that were affected by this event.  On the other hand thought, my neighbor made a good comment about the event. She said that, yes this is horrible and devistating, but it is the price we pay for freedom. Her comment stayed with me because although it\'s not the most sensitive comment it is true\"praying for the presidenthonestly don\'t knowbelieving in a cuase',4,-5,0,2,5,4.05,5.41,0,0,0,0,0,0.68,2.7,0,0,0,11.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.76,1.35,0,2.03,8.11,1.35,0,0,6.76,0,0,0,1.35,0,0,0,0,54.74,0,4.05,0,0,0,0,1.35,0,62.85,5.41,0,8.11,0,0,0,0,0,1.35,4.05,1.35,0,0,0,24.33,8.11,0,0,0,0,8.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.68,Female49bb

I felt sadness when I first got the news.  My heart went to all the families and loved ones.  I thought to myself, who would do something like this.  First I thought the people who did this were going to go straight to hell no questions asked.  But I realized after watching the news and then hearing everyones stories, that these terrorists that did this were the true definition of evil.  Why would and individual do this?  As an AMerican my first reaction was kill them all, and do not have any regrets.  I believe that is what we should do not take everyone down that was in this and make them suffer as much as the victims did.\"\"I really haven\'t changed in any ways, people might of thought I would of  maybe denied my faith, but I don\'t I grew stong to it.

That\'s my opinion!\"\"The day of September 11th I trully was moritfied, with everything that was happening within the first couple of hours, after the two planes had crashed into the twin towers. There were so many things that rushed to my mind.  First of all I thought Oh great they are going to blame it on the Muslims, like they did for the Oklahoma Bombings.(Which me, myself is Muslim-American!) There was so much hate going around, which my friends and I couldn\'t help, but be scared for I knew some people would want to hurt us no matter if we were innocent or not.  At First when media and people started to blame Mulsims I was just hoping that it wasn\'t Muslims, because in our culture it is a major sin to kill others and commit suicide.  Our Lord would never ask of us to do a treturous act to others. I trully am sorry for all thoses who got hurt and died in this unspeakable act. And I really like to pay all my condolences to thoses who last loved ones, and not only that I wish there was more I(personally)could do. But for as of this moment I just hope and pray everyone is doing fine and will find in their hearts to move on and remember what the brave people did to stop and help of what has been done to the United States.

I am not concerned for my personal safety but I worry if the world my future kids grow up in will be less  free  than what I have enjoyed. I hope that I will remain more sensitive to other people\'s needs...\"I am greatly troubled by last Tuesday\'s events.  At first I could not believe it... It was like watching a video on TV--it did not seem real, no matter how often I saw it.  The twin towers are the best symbol of New York and represent American commerce.   My boyfriend saw the 2nd plane hit the WTC from atop a building in Newark and saw the buildings crumble later on...  He is very deeply disturbed in a way that I have never seen in him before and only now is he beginning to talk about what he experienced with friends.  I truly hope that such an atrocity will never happen to anyone in the world ever again (though I recognize that is more hopeful than realistic.) I have always thought that Americans in the U.S. were safe from attack.  The calculated orchestration of the attack (and the fact that the terrorists had lived here for months/years truly worries me.)  I am also troubled by the prospect of entering into a war, but I agree that the U.S. needs to take a  stand  of some kind to enforce that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated.  However, I am heartened by the great show of support among all Americans during this time of crisis.    I hope that all Americans will come out of this better people as well as better citizens.  Life (and our freedoms) are a gift which we usually take for granted.  I hope that years from now, people will still remember these gifts and be kinder, and less self-absorbed.  We have some wonderful and valuable lessons to learn from this disaster--so long as we allow them to permeate our being (and not just to affect us for a few weeks as with most new year\'s resolutions).     Incidentally, I really hope that SOMEONE comes out of the wreckage alive.  They would be the inspiration for the whole country and for the next generation...

'treasure life even more\"I was completely shocked and sad. I thought this kind of thing shouldn\'t be happening in the 21st century. I\'d really want to show sympathy to the families in which some of their loved ones were died in the tragedy. I also have a sense of insecurity too, even though New Zealand is quite geographically isolated, yet the terrorists can go anywhere. It\'s really devastating and unbelievable to have such thing happened, especially in the US...It\'s a great loss to America since the people who died in the World Trade Centre are so innocent and they were very much likely to be capable, clever professionals... apart from human lives, the beautifully designed buildings were demolished in an hour, what a waste and pain it was!

I feel that things like this are unexplainable from a spiritual perspective.  I haven\'t even tried to make sense of it.  I have tried to put myself in the shoes of all who have suffered loss and in all the shoes of the poeple in charge of clean up.  I can\'t imagine having to pull bodies and body parts out of that rubble.  I would like to understand why the ment who hijacked those planes did what they did.  I am not sure I am read for an answer though.  I try not to think about it.  It almost seems like a dream that it even happened!   I want our country to revenge.  I want us to blow Osama Bin Laden to pieces.  Osama Bin Laden and the TalibanI think about our freedom more now.  I am more grateful to live in America.  I am more defensive when I hear people saying bad things about our governmentOsama bin Laden and others who hate the USA\"I have mixed feelings about 9/11.  I\'ve been told by people of other countries that the US has been a terrorist country to many other countries in the past and the rest of the world hates us for our capitalistic/imperialist actions.  I am hurt that other people see us in this vein.  I was a small child during WWII and remember the terror in my mind then.  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has set in again for me.  I was a depressed child and those feelings have arisen again.   I am skeptical about our leadership as opposed to stewardship of the earth.  I also believe that planets and their position in the sky have something to do with how humans act and react.  I was raised a fundamentalist with all of the end of the world prophecies as a background but have studied religion and feel that our world as we know it has come to an end.  A new order will arise out of this and we will finally get to the Age of Aquarius and maybe peace will reign on what is left of this earth.  I also believe that politics as we know it is corrupt, corporations rule America and the global reach of all of it has generated what has happened.  Old plans and systems are hard to change.  We have technology that doesn\'t pollute the earth but the old ways of using oil as a main energy source die hard because the people who depend on these sources for a good living do not want to give them up for something they haven\'t studied since they have been comfortable with their old ways.   I just wonder when the meek will inherit the earth.\"I stay home.  I appreciate the sky at night but sometimes am paranoid about planes flying over.

'\"I have found the travel through the grief process interesting.  On one of the first days following the attack, a clinician discussed the response to trauma....disbelief, numbness, anger, etc.  As each of those emotions have \'hit\' me, I have reflected back to the grief process. I am able to recognize when I advance to a new stage. Last week, I couldn\'t quite grasp that this had happened.  I spent one evening watching the news over and over until the images started to penetrate my mind.  I still can\'t quite appreciate the death toll.  5,000 people is such a large number, and the reverberations are so great with orphans and widows.  I can\'t quite get through this trauma.  Disbelief comes back from time to time. Late last week I experienced numbness.  I functioned at work, but only wanted to return to the safety of my own home....or listen to the news through my computer monitor.   I went to church on Friday which brought a small measure of peace.  It was the first tangible thing that I was able to \'do\'. Over the weekend, I experienced survivor\'s guilt.  My birthday is 9/17, but I didn\'t feel like celebrating when innocent victims still lay in the rubble. On 9/17, my friend and I bought grocery supplies for the USO as they support families visiting the morgue.  Again, having something concrete to give brought some relief. Now I feel that I am starting to move into the anger stage.  As stories emerge about people\'s personal effects found, or body parts, I am angered that someone would intentionally inflict harm on such innocents. In my defiance, I have decorated my house and car in patriotic colors. I am working my way through this, but the trauma goes on in different forms each day. Last night on Larry King Live, he hosted the CEO who lost 700 staffers....it was so sad.  1,500 orphaned children, widows phoning him begging for paychecks, etc. The pain comes from many angles. As a young American adult, I have had many opportunities in this country, but few tests.  9/11/01 is a large scale test.  When I look at my children, and think about the sacrifices of my ancestors, I vow not to let anyone down.  I plan to maintain safety for my children, and honor for my country in respect for those who have gone before me.\"\"In a small way, I am slightly fearful.  The sound of planes used to fade into the background, now I have a jolt of adrenaline when I hear the engine noise.  I am scheduled to visit a large city tomorrow for a conference, and the possibility of danger has crossed my mind.  I\'ll still attend the conference though. I am more polite, patient and understanding for the most part.  People have been behaving in more dignified manner for the last week, and I have been doing my part as well.  I would like to see this continue. My sense of patriotism has resurfaced...it was always there, but it has returned to the forefront for the last 9 days.\"\"From what I can gather, a small group of fundamentalists who hate what America stands for and are willing to give up their lives to show their contempt.  I don\'t know exactly who the groups are, and I am ignorant of foreign affairs for the most part, but I am learning.  The reports also indicate that the hijackers took advantage of our freedom buy infiltrating our work force, schools, etc.\"\"To hurt us.....I can\'t fathom their thinking.  Although I have my own set of beliefs, I would never force them on anyone else, and I could never even fantasize about harming another person to make my point.  I guess I\'ll have to study more about this part of the world and how the people living there have been shaped.\"Avoid the news because sick and tired of the endless crap about \'fighting evil\'\'war on terrorism\' what a hypocritical joke.\"My first reaction was tearful as Bush is widely known as being \'itching fior a fight\' and I thought about how he would probably rush out and drop bombs in retribution. It made me feel like the disarmament and peace movements had been a waste of time, and how screwed up the world is because people think the only answer to violence is more violence and that\'s incredibly hypocritical. Wondered why us women of the world get stuck with these masculinist power systems and have our fathers, husbands or sons sent off in stupid, pointless \'HE started it\' pre-school mentality conflicts. I felt very sorry for the people in the US, but also wondered why they seemed so suprised as their country bombs others regularly - so why didn\'t they think it would happen to them? Living in a small county who has been severly bullied over trade deals etc by the US - wondered why the \'bully\' was so upset at a bit of bullying back. Does American freedom mean the freedon to do what they like, regardless of the price other countries must pay? So, the world seems like it\'s in a crap space at the moment. I thought - will they act like grown-ups and go in for renewed efforts for peace or be just like kids and run round demanding \'retaliation\' and why does the media insist on supporting retaliation? Why is there so little debate on this? Talk about \'war on evil\' and \'God bless America\' makes my stomach turn - last time I looked the Bible said \'thou shalt not kill\' and Jesus advocated meekness and emphasised non-retaliation \'offering the other cheek\'- so the US seems about as anti-christian as any other country - why on earth would God bless America? I think he\'d be shaking his heasd in disgust at the blood-thirst and \'violence is good because we\'re in the right attitude\'. Thought about my cousin in NY, hope he is okay. Sorry guys, all war is bad. As for \'war on terrorism\' that\'s a joke, terrorism is by nature not a thing you can have a war with - it seems just another excuse for blood. Feel sorry for the poor Afghani\'s, all those innocents ground down by poverty, starving families watching their little ones die under a regime that the US helped put into place - seems like a re-enactement of some of the CIA dealings in central and sth America. I also thought sure-it\'s very sad, but would the US give a crap if it was 5,000 brown people dying? In some far off land? Nope, not even if it was a million (unless it threated their oil industry). In retaliation - who is going to suffer for this? The poor, weak and oppressed. How about, instead of fighting, go into talks and offer support for the ordinary person. I also wondered why we are being asked to give money to US citizens when they are far richer than my own people, many of whom live in appalling poverty. Why no Americans saying \'why did this happen, why do so many people dislike us?\'Why are they so self-absorbed and insular as to not try and work from the big-picture? The world economy will probably dive, not from the attacks, but from America\'s posing on the subject. \'Strong American spirit\' is something I have not seen anything of - either that or they don\'t know what true strength really is. In my culture, reaction I think would be quite different, so maybe it\'s just a lack of cultural understanding on my part when I wonder what the hell all the fuss is about when people die in bombing probably every day in the world - again, not that I\'m not empathetic - but the obsession with the issue just seems a little weird from where I am - lots of sack-cloth and ashes and stuff, plenty of materialism, \'stars\' doing a charity concert (would you do that to help your indigenous people, the people you exploited and stole from and who are now marginalised and ghetto-ised? If I suggested you do it now, I can imagine what the response would be.)That weird saccharine-sweet \'insincere\' empathy that I see on the TV - someone needs to tell them this is real, not a movie. Esp GWB, who seems to live in the world of fantasy (please tell him this isn\'t a John Wayne re-run). The US people are portrayed here as a good example of how not to be - a nation of the overweight and neurotic and unhappy. Seems harsh now, but maybe that is part of the reaction we\'ve seen, blaming others is good when you don\'t want to look at yourself.  So is there hope for the world if we are so ignorant as to condone violence because the other guy did something naughty? What of us, who have been pulled into America\'s uneccessary wars before, the sheer silliness of \'yellow peril\' and \'domino theory\' etc - our boys who died in Vietnam for no reason at all. Bin Laden - why do they want him - on the basis of no evidence at all? I wouldn\'t hand him over either - if a policeman came to my door and wanted my husband because he\'d done something, I\'d say show me your evidence or you can piss off. Maybe America just needs a boogeyman, so they can sleep safe at night, imagining that they\'re safe because they got the boogeyman - regardless of any reality out there. Why do people resort to terrorism? Because they are desperate? Feel they have no option left to them? Or is it just the way they are? My family went off to fight in the wars, beacuase they had made a promise to the English queen, and later Uncle Sam. We lost our fine young men, we - who had suffered so much, losing \%80 of our people in the colonisation of our country, still sent our boys to die on foreign battlefield. No, we\'re not proud, us women, to have taken part in the death of our youngsters. Why American\'s seem to have pride in death I\'ll never know. Just seems like a man\'s world.\"\"Don\'t know - no evidence really. Could be any one of a whole bunch of anti-US groups, there sure are enough of them.\"\"Desperation, fear, belief in one\'s actions as being right because they are acting against and evil force. Male values.\"\"The events were very sad and disturbing.  My husband and I had just left New York City the night before (on a flight from JFK at 11:00 PM).  I am grateful that we are safe, but extremely sad for all the families and friends of the victims in all three locations. Although I would like to stand behind President Bush, I am deeply troubled that the first reaction, from our government, was to wage a war.  I feel this initial reaction, on the part of our government, has resulted in the nation\'s thirst for blood--and that nothing short of bloodshed by individuals involved with the terrorist organizations will quench that thirst.  This troubles me as I think our nation, as well as nations that have supported our efforts, could have spent more time in thinking about other solutions.  I fear that many people, Muslims, Americans in the armed forces, etc., will lose their lives.\"\"Again, I believe our foreign policy has played a role.  The fact that we assisted the Afghans in their battles against the Russians, then left them with no aid, is horrible.  I believe these individuals believe in what they did, and believe that they were doing the work of their higher power.  I do not agree that Islam calls for such violence, but what is most important is the *perceptions* of Islam of these individuals (spoken like a true social psychologist!).  Many of these individuals live under horrible conditions (not only human rights violations, but lacking basic needs such as food and health care).  Such hopelessness, I believe, breeds discontent...\"\"Although most likely considered  unpatriotic  at this time, I believe our foreign policy for many, many years has, in part, led to these events.  I think it would be impossible to hold any one individual, or any one organization, responsible for what has happened.  We live in a complex world and any statement of culpability needs to incorporate that complexity.\"I don\'t believe they have.  1. The dead terrorists 2. Other terrorists that assisted 3. The US Govt.\"Not a great deal, except for conversations are 90\% about it, and some paranoia.\"\"Because they were so incredibly angry, and they have nothing, so there\'s nothing to lose.\"\"The event was (and is) tragic, frightening, shocking, disorienting.  It has changed my life, and the lives of those around me (in NYC).  I think it will change the lives of everyone.   I fear a war will be started by the US.  But I feel that the attacks were caused by US govt. policy.  this govt. and society has been so arrogant and self-righteous.  But we are wrong.  If this does not change, I feel that we will be annihilated. We must do all that we can to help other people in other places (such as Afghanistan).  We cannot force our beliefs on them (ie, democracy).  But I do not have confidence in the govt. to do these things. I am fearful because I do not believe in the current govt.  The  president  is not a true president.  He is unable to lead.  He is a puppet reading a script written by others.  I do not know or trust these others.  I think their flailing is indicitive of their lack of knowledge and intelligence.  this scares the shit out of me.\"Jealousy. Pure and simple.I feel that it was a mission carried out by a plethora of individuals backed by either Osama bin Laden and/or other prominent middle eastern extremists.I am astounded that this attck could have taken place without our leaders having known a thing about it. I am highly dismayed at the USA\'s apparent lack of preparation and intelligence data regarding the threat to the USA by terrorists. I once felt fairly safe here.

'\"I don\'t think my behaviors have changed really.   I do turn on the t.v. every morning now to catch up on updates in the news.  I try not to let it bother me too much, because I think if we all live in fear, than our so called freedom has been beaten.  \"That Osama bin Ladin guy.\"The September 11th attack was something I only imagined seeing on theatre screens.  I never thought anything like that could happen.  Thinking this way makes me believe we live in a \'just\' world.  That nothing bad would ever happen to us---the Americans with so much freedom.  I remember I was at work the time it happend. I work in a big outlet mall in Katy, TX, and remember seeing the big screens hanging from the hallways of the mall which usually blare cheesy elevator music had all of a sudden switched to the live coverage of the events.  Needless to say, the biggest part of my morning was spent staining my ears to hear the sounds from inside my store, and attempting to carry on with my existance as usual.  The day was anything but ordianry.  Thousands of miles away, where I thought I wouldn\'t be directly affected by the mornings events, I realized I was being hurt by the acts of terrorism as well.  Sharply at 2pm, the mall closed down, and we all left to venture back to our homes.  As I sat glued to the t.v., no matter what channel I turned it on..it was there. Trying to find relief from the pain and suffering, I switched it to MTV, unfortunately it was covered on that channel too.  For the days to follow, my college classes met as usual, but we all sat and discussed the events.  I couldn\'t believe it actually happend.  And hearing that there were some passangers that were instructed to call their loved ones, was beyond belief.  There was like this cloud of terror and sorrow that engulfed everyone.  As much as I tried to be normal, nothing succeeded.  To know that there were people who so strongly believed in something to risk their life to kill thousands of others amazes me.  Something I can\'t quite grasp the concept of.  After a few days, all I wanted was to hear about something positive, something different, something new.  My boyfriend\'s sister had her precious baby girl on the 11th.  And it was hard to mix the feelings of sadness and sorrow with the ones that should be felt when a new human arrives in the world.  It made me think of what horrible things she will have to experience in her life.... This was a day I\'ll soon never forget.\"\"Because they see the United States and all it\'s people to be sinners...because we have freedom, because women have a place in society, because we can  drink and be merry. \"000Al Q\'aeda\"I think that it is the saddest thing that has ever happened to America. terrooorists were not just trying to make their mark, or show their strength, instead they were trying to hurt thousands of people, and cripple our economy.  I feel that this is a direct attack on America, as a whole, and everything we stand for.  I would love for the country to retaliate, and show them what we are made of, but at the same time I don\'t want innocent people killed all over again.  (because then we are down at their level)  This is an awful decision, that I wish would be made more easily, but I know that it can\'t.  I hate the thought of a war, and our innocent soldiers dying for this.  Also, Bin Laden, is the obious sick brains behind this, and I hink that he should be the one that is tortured, along with his followers.  How is America so naive, that we actually train the people to fly in our country and then we ruin our country?  How are the airports so loose, that these people get on with weapons.   It is a sad story, and I have many mixed emotions.\"Bin Laden and his followers\"I am more afraid of being out in public for some reason and I look at all different people as if thinking, you could be a terrorist and we wouldn\'t even know. \"They are sick people whoa re jealous of our country. \"I am shocked, saddened, angry, scared, in stunned disblief. I am truly frightened about how we (the US) might respond to this issue. I support a limited military engagement (I think). However, I really oppose innocent people being killed such as the soldiers we are going to send to fight in this engagement, not to mention people in Afghanistan who happen to live there. While I am not a pacifist, I do not think a pacifist approach would be the wrong one in this situation. We can act by making our airports safer, by toughening our immigration laws, and by patrolling our borders more effectively. This can help us feel in control and like  we have done something.  We don\'t have to engage in military action to  do something. \"Personally I don\'t think we have enough information to know who is responsible at this point other than they are  terrorists. \"I know they\'ll be changed when I fly. Other than that, I can\'t say that they have changed much at all.\"\"People do a lot of violent, crazy things because of their beliefs. People kill doctors who perform abortions because they are opposed to abortion. The logic doesn\'t make sense.\"A disturbed individual who I could only liken to be like Adolf Hitler.\"I was an Australian Tourist on holiday in New York when the attacks happened.  My first thought was that it wasn\'t real.  that this couldn\'t be happening.  After all, it\'s New York City and you just can\'t crash planes into buildings!  Then it was one of realising that we were under terrorist attack and a sense of not knowing what was going to happen next.  When they shut the city down, I felt very uneasy.  I felt like a sitting duck and started to wonder if this is what the terrorists really wanted.  Did they want to shut the city down and then blow us all sky high.  I was fearful for my life.  I was evacuated the following night from my hotel in the first bomb threat at the Empire State Building because I was 2 streets from Empire State.  I\'m running down stairst not knowing if this breath was my last.  I didn\'t know if I was going to live or die and I was terrified.  I still can\'t verbalise that feeling and I don\'t think I ever will be able to.  All I can say is that I wouldn\'t wish that feeling on even my worst enemy.  I\'m fundamentally different since September 11.  I have depth of feeling now that makes me different from everyone I know back here in Australia.  It\'s isolating.  I\'ve tried to get back to some normality but it\'s very difficult.  I\'m so far away from where it happened now and that is actually making it difficult for me to recover.  I feel like the only place I belong right now is New York.  Nothing else feels right.  I\'m trying to continue on with my studies because I refuse to let this beat me.  I\'m returning to New York on December 26 to study for 6 months and I\'ve never been more focused or determined to do anything in my life.  These terrorists will not beat me.  But people here just don\'t understand the position I\'m coming from.  They think I\'m crazy for wanting to fly back and be in the city where it happened.  To me, it\'s the only sane thing for me to do.  I, like everyone else who lived through this horror, need to make peace with it in my heart before I can even hope to try and have some sort of  normality  in my life.\"\"Very angry, very emotional.

'\"The American foreign policies over the last 20 years; embargos, bombs, prejudice against Muslims\"\"no way out; feeling absolutely helpless; no big budget, no big military to fight back\"I visited a mosque and want to learn more about Islam.\"I am non-American (German, to be exact) and in the States on a work visa. So Americans have now felt the blow of terrorism for the first time - many, many countries in the world have been living with terrorism for many years. I am, of course, appalled by what happend on Tuesday, but what bothers me even more is the reaction of mainstream America. Everything is about the US and Americans only - the rest of the world doesn\'t exist. Here\'s a situation where America (and I use this term to mean the US government as it represents its people) could finally join the rest of the world (if not in Kyoto, if not in Durban, maybe now in the world wode fight against terrorism). Instead it is  the good guys (us) vs. the evil . And  dead or alive  - how naive. In good times I don\'t mind that maintream America is so ignorant about the rest of the world; I understand that the US is so big, people are wrapped up in domestic affairs. I even  defend  the US when Europeans complain that Americans don\'t know Europe. (My response it that they, the Europeans, don\'t know much about Montana or North Dakota etc either). But now, the naivet  of Americans can cause world war III and it is no longer cute. Why is nobody asking what made these terrorists attack the US the way they did? Why is nobody asking how much pain and suffering these people must have felt to undertake such an attack? Why do people not see that there is a link to American foreign policy over the last 20 years or so? \"\"Obviously this was a horrible tragedy that resulted in significant unnecessary loss of life and property.  Our sense of security in our world and in our way of life has been shaken.  As the nation grapples with this, I am concerned that we will go too far in our efforts to  prevent  this from happening again.  I am not convinced that any degree of security could have prevented it, although it may have made the impact less or made it more difficult for the terrorists to accomplish.  I have been wondering if one consequence of the kind of freedom and privacy we enjoy is that we are vulnerable to these types of attacks.  To reduce our vulnerability we will reduce our degree of freedom and privacy.  I think we ALL have to consider the consequences of that and not presume that we will only need to infringe on the freedom of  foreigners .  I feel concerned at the new level of suspicion and racial profiling that is happening now and hope that we don\'t compromise the very principles of individual respect and right to pursuit of happiness that made our nation great.  Maybe we have to accept that the downside of being a free nation is that some will choose to abuse that freedom to harm others - not just foreign terrorists but fellow Americans too - as hard as it seems that may be the price for freedom.  Is that price too high?  Are we willing to live in a more militarist state if it means that the chances  of being harmed are reduced?  Reduced by how much and at what loss of freedom?  I don\'t know if I\'m willing to give the government more right to tap my phone, search and detain me in a  swoop , conduct military tribunals in secret and make me carry a national ID card.  That price seems pretty high for all of us.  I don\'t know.\"\"I am in closer contact with family/friends; I get more specific, detailed info about my husband\'s travel arrangements; I am not making major purchases in case we lose our jobs\"\"foreign terrorists, likely Osama Bin Laden\"hatred and revenge; pride in proving that they could do it\"I\'m listening to the radio with one ear, listening to people--mostly men--cry on WNYC, my local National Public Radio Station.  I want to hear them cry because I\'m having such a hard time coming to terms with my own tears.  My deepest thoughts and feelings?  Thoughts, first: I think oh yeah, this is a great opportunity to feel that I\'m part of humanity.  One of the first emails I got was a suggestion to have students freewrite about Humanity (I teach college English Composition).  I have a hard time connecting to people, and I\'ve always thought it because I was usually in the wrong place.  This outpouring of raw, intense feeling that I\'ve seen and heard this week in Manhattan (where I live) doesn\'t let me off the hook.  I can\'t complain that people aren\'t  letting me in.   At least for the first few days, everyone was more open than I ever experienced them in NYC.  I should say everyone except me.  I walked past the large vigil at Union Square on Friday night, and I didn\'t cross the street to join it.  I didn\'t go to any of the vigils in my neighborhood or where I teach or where I take a class.  When I spoke with a friend on the phone Tuesday, I began to cry, and I imeediately coughed and said,  My allergies are awful today.   To unite with people at this level--the level of terror, of pain, of loss--but I guess that\'s what grief is about--that\'s scary.  I\'m not used to letting myself feel, and I think I\'m scared of feeling too deeply, being overwhelmed.  Next month my son would have been 33.  He died of crib death (sids) at ten weeks.  I know loss and grief.  My boss at the time thought he was consoling me when he said,  Well, at least Sandy was only ten weeks old.   I guess that my grief about my son\'s death is connected to the grief we share over Tuesday\'s terrorism.  To tap that grief is frightening.  Writing this now, I feel I\'m having a really difficult time getting to my feelings.  I keep thinking that if I keep writing, I\'ll get to them.  I tear up a tiny bit as I write, and I think,  Oh good, I\'m getting to the deeper feelings.  And then they pass.  Maybe I should have written this at another time, but these are my thoughts and feelings now, a week after the event. \"\"Which someone--the pilots who crashed their planes?  The people who masterminded this?  I think a lot of people involved did this because they believed they were making a supreme spiritual (religious) sacrifice, a bold heroic deed. The U.S. does some pretty nasty stuff, but we don\'t have the spiritual reasons that I (mistakenly?) attribute to the people behind this.  The U.S. acts or doesn\'t act when it\'s expedient.  We\'re cold-blooded.  I think that maybe the people who did this are hot-blooded.\"\"I\'m thinking a lot more about how I miss the connection to others that others seem to have; and I think I\'ve been acting more distant.  I don\'t know.  I\'m more patient. Today I was waiting in a checkout line behind someone who was taking forever.  The man behind me in line (each of us had just one thing) was patient, too.  The clerk ringing up the big sale in front of me was irritated and kept saying  A week ago people were a lot nicer.  They forget fast.   She, meanwhile, was the one who was jittery and nasty because she was having a hard time completing the transaction. My sleep patterns have changed.  I sleep fewer hours, stay up late reading updates on the (excellent) internet sites, or working on the sites I\'ve set up for my courses.  Time disappears because whatever I\'m doing makes it go faster, but I feel I\'m not accomplishing much, not doing the things I need to do (like finally pay my taxes now that I\'ve gotten two extensions). I don\'t feel my behavior has changed in any big ways, but who knows. Maybe it has been. Maybe I should fill out this questionnaire in a few weeks and see how things changed.\"\"I think of it as a  what  rather than a  who.   The  what  is made up of things like jealousy, greed, anger, craziness, spirituality, love.\"Desperation/frustration/sense of righteousness. \"I think event was a tragedy, but by no means extraordinary. Terrorist attacks have been going on for decades. And they are certainly not new to the United States. Popular outrage and disbelief speaks to a deep-rooted naivete in the American people. Questions of  Why us?  and statements of  I never thought it could happen here  reflect just how isolated and ignorant US citizens are of what is happening in the world around them. In the last year, Ariel Sharon has brutally attacked Palestinians living in Israel several times. Where was US outrage then? During the Gulf War, the US encouraged Kurds to rise up against Hussein. When these people were subsequently brutalized, we turned a blind eye. Tales of massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia make background noise in the wake of the latest affairs of Tom and Nicole and Brad and Jennifer. Terrorism, violence and war exist. All over the world. Kids are killing each other in the streets of our very cities. Where is our moral outrage and sense of justice and righteousness then? This terrible event was not an assault on our sovereignty, much as the news media and the president have proclaimed. It was an assault on *people*. It was intended to inflict suffering on US citizens, just as it is inflicted on others all around the world, everyday, in some cases BY us.  I am sorry for the families of those who have lost their lives in these tragedies. I am sorry for those who have lost their lives in tragedies elsewhere. I am sorry that some group felt the need to commit these terrible acts in order to get what they wanted. I\'m sorry we have failed to learn from history and are thus doomed to repeat it. I am bitter that people have spoken of these bombings and demanded revenge in patriotic language. It is a tragedy of humanity, not a nation. America needs to stop navel gazing and wake up to the world. It\'s about people, stupid, not a flag.\"no change whatsoever0to send a message.. make a point on the deepest level.. show how deep their own beliefs and emotions go the human race\"It is very interesting to me to think about how language affects the way we think and feel about things.. especially such major and traumatic events.  I tend to arrange things in my mind by writing or talking.. but I don\'t know if the two ways of using language are the same.  It is difficult to express which feelings are deepest in writing.. how to give emphasis without overusing adjectives and so on? Anyway - my reactions. At first - I heard the news on the radio when I woke up -and turned on the tv.. and saw the two tours burning.  and in my groggy state.. I was in a state of disbelief- It can\'t be real and all that.  I have had problems with American foreign policy and general attitudes among Americans for some years.. and (do not misunderstand - I was not glad to see the attacks) in some ways not surprised at all to see that we were being attacked.. after all.. we have been attacked how many times in the last 10 years and more?  and really feeling rather disconnected from it all on a cerebral level.. thinking in terms of foreign policy and all this stuff... this was the first 2-3 minutes at most of watching.. as if this were a movie -like so many have said.. And then the next thing I remember is Mayor Guliani on the tv saying that he and this other guy had been trapped in the rubble of the first collapse and they talked about how many people would be in those buildings on a given day... and then I was terrified and sickenedn and overwhelmed by the horror of it.. It was television controlling my reactions at its finest.. First images.. and my cerebral reaction.. then.. putting faces and feelings on it and my emotions reacted.  I was glued to the television for many hours a day (5 the first day and at least 3 a day the following few days).. I could not pull myself away.. I needed some way to participate and connect and had no idea how to do it without watching tv.. the blood drive was overwhelmed.. and a check in the mail does little to gratify the energy that needs to be released.. a need for physical activity.. I wanted to drive to NY to pick up rubble - anything to be involved.  When I had to go to work and wait tables at this fancy resort - serve drinks - show interest in the lives of my guests.. it was surreal... I could not understand how the world was not at a standstill.. watching and waiting for what is next.  I am glad I have a job to go to - it has forced me away from the tv and into conversation with other people- into relationships.. making it easier to put things in perspective.  Almost everyone I know was affected.. A co-worker was on the plane and scheduled to land in NY at 9:00 on that morning.. and was diverted several times before finally landing and driving back home.. she says she will never fly again.. My uncle works at the Pentagon and is thankfully ok.  My cousin and several friends live in NY - they are ok.  but it was a harrowing several hours as I tried to locate them and wait for news.  I was there when a co-worker found out some of her highschool classmates were killed. I have friends who have relatives in the military.  I am overwhelmed by the personal ramifications this is having for people on all levels. There is so much to take in..  and so much to think about on a public level as well.. the awful hate crimes against people of arabic descent.. I waited on a guy who is arabic and I even had to check myself so that I did not treat him differently -whether through my own fear of waiting on him (which surprised me and was difficult to deal with.. all this emotion as I say..  good evening ) or too obvious a demonstration of  I respect you .. or my overwhelming curiosity.. I had so many questions.. what is his experience ? What does he think?  What wine do you want with your meal sir?... bizarre.   and now..  the new war .. will there some day be a draft? Did my grandmothers go through these fears and emotions in the early 40\'s- what happens next?  the personal fears - and then the public ones -Does violence beget violence? What are all the options? Colin Powell is the most soothing public figure I can think of.. I feel absolutely reassured that someone is calmly and methodically doing something about all this.. but what is it?  where will it lead?  If I am unsure I want a violent military response - then what are the other options? I am now aware in a different way that fear and ignorance are everywhere.. the world is full of people who are throwing around their opinions and wearing their flags without the slightest ideas of what goes on in other religions and countries and how war and economic deprivation are a way of life for so many.. fear of attack is not a new phenomenon.. I waited on a British couple the night of the attacks.. and they talked about how they fear IRA bombings in their own country.. I have been intellectually aware of what goes on in the rest of the world.. but this week has brought it home in a whole new way.. walk a mile in their shoes holds more images for my imagination. I feel the most privileged and sincerely patriotic about my country since I was saying the pledge of allegiance in grade school.. My disenchantment with my country is very different now.  I wonder at how the media is now trying to quickly educate the publice on Bin Laden and other terrorists.. the intricacies of foreign policy, politics, economic factors.. SO MUCH INFORMATION. How can anyone take it all in? How can the citizens of this country possibly be informed enough to make decisions and voice opinions about what they want for our future?  How can I do this? A side note.. I was watching mostly NBC news for the first several days.. and after several hours.. you begin to notice things like.. how the colors in the banner at the bottom are changing.. the images that someone chose to show as the opener and the background for Tom? and it occurred to me in the middle of the report.. that someone was frantically at work in the station putting this all together and making decisions about what it will all look like.. and so on.. it was bizarre.. I don\'t know what other word to use.. it adds to the movie quality feel of the whole thing.. So much high tech in the midst of the basic human story.. anger, grief, loss, love for others and God and country.  I had to turn it off.  It was incongruous to me.. even though as I write this now.. I know that those people were trying to best express that human story with their own abilities.. but still very bizarre - made me feel disconnected from everyone. So I think that\'s enough for you.. I sincerely hope that those of you reading everyone\'s reactions are not traumatized and overwhelmed by the sheer volume of it all...as I\'m sure there will be so many.  That is certainly how I am feeling and how I know many of my friends are feeling.. overwhelmed by information and emotion and the sheer number of horrible stories everywhere you turn  - and the need to do something.. but what.. and how to decide? Good luck to you\"I laugh more and goof off more and am less socially afraid to be myself... and I am living with more direction and determination..

'\"I am more disappointed than ever in the human species as a whole, but it seems that those around me are retaining the qualities that I used to attribute to humanity in general - perhaps there are more like my friends out there. Actually, I think that that is the case, it is no good being cynical - unfortunately it is the leaders of the various countries in this world who have me wondering (plus some of those that ring in to talk-back radio). Behaviours then - I guess that it is more in my thinking than anything else. Perhaps no change in behaviour.\"???? \"My first thoughts about the attacks went straight to a friend of mine who lives not far from where they occurred (in NY). It was terrible not being able to get through to his family (who live in Chicago) because they weren\'t at home, but at the same time I figured that he was really unlikely to be at the WTC because he is more of a herbal sort of person rather than a business person. Still, he lives not far from there and he could have been in the vicinity. As it turns out he was not only fine in the sense of being safe but also oblivious to it all, not having a TV or radio. In addition to thinking of my friend and his family, I was glued to the radio (I don\'t have a TV) for about three hours. This was sometime after the events had happened (a good 8 hours) because I was asleep when the attacks occurred (living in Sydney, Australia). A certain quote was played again and again, even days later, that I almost have memorised. It was an articulate woman with such grief and panic in her voice, the main part of which was \'they are jumping out of the windows\'. Thinking about this right now makes me want to cry all over again. I went into uni later in the day and saw the images on TV for the first time - I thought that the initial shock was over but it was well and truly renewed on seeing people falling from the buildings, and also the planes entering the buildings again and again. The feeling here (Sydney Uni) was very eerie. Most people were just standing around and watching TV, or in a kind of tense shock and grief. I heard that someone (a Muslim guy) started putting up some anti-US material in one of our student places (a social area containing cafes, bar and eating areas) and that he was surrounded and yelled at and that it appeared that there was going to be a fight, even though I don\'t think that that eventuated. Since then, the shock and much of the grief has waned even though every news report contains reference to what happened (with the focus more on what is about to happen). Life is to most appearances back to normal here, but there is a residual tension. For me, this comes mainly from what I hear on the radio about the possible responses to the attacks, the racist outbreaks in Australia, the ever-increasing popularity of our own prime minister (John Howard) whose popularity has gone from being incredibly low to incredibly high and the thought of the citizens of Afghanistan and those of the US. To elaborate: The possibility of going to war with Afghanistan seems strange to me for a number of reasons. 1) As far as I am aware, it is not yet known who is responsible for the attack - certainly bin Ledin was named immediately but I am not aware of any evidence directly linking him to what happened. I heard an interview on the radio with a British man who interviewed bin Laden two years ago, and it was his view that this might have been done in the name of bin Laden, or as something that the terrorists thought would please him, but that as for him masterminding the whole thing that it was unlikely. This is not to say that he is not involved, rather that it is, of course, possible that he was not. If this is the case, then it is wrong to punish him unfairly, and it is unwise to ignore the real perpetrators. 2) Assuming that it can be demonstrated that bin Ledin and the Taliban were responsible, it is not clear how going to war with Afghanistan will help to capture these people. Surely they are well and truly hidden away. Perhaps my definition of war differs from what is planned, but if it is like the bombing of Germany, then it will probably be ineffectual in achieving what is (or in my opinion, should be) desired (i.e., the capture of those and only those responsible). 3) I watched on TV the address that Bush gave the American Congress and my overall impression was one of horror. He was welcomed like a home-coming hero, which on its own would not have been so bad. This was accompanied with what really frightened me, which was the uncritical acceptance of all that he said by everyone in the room. Not once did I see people looking sceptical, concerned, or in outright disagreement with what Bush said, rather it was a repetitive scene of standing and clapping to his rhetoric. This is so wrong. He is one individual among many. While it may be his legal right to make decisions, there were many other people in that room (and out of it) who are employed to represent those who have voted for them. Where was the dissent? It seemed more like an experiment in public relations than an intelligent discussion of the options - each person giving their thought-out opinion. This, it seems to me, was the purpose of including in the room the wife of one of the people who died on the plane, and also the holding up of the badge of the police officer who died in the aftermath. What the world needs to decide in terms of reaction to the bombings should be done with a cool head, not using the grief of the relations of the victim as a criterion. Their loved ones will not come back no matter how many more poeple die. The reaction should not be an act of avengence on their behalf. It is not clear that this is something that they would want, but even if it is, it is not up to the victim to be the jury nor set the sentence of those who have wronged them. In addition, Bush talked of using any weapon of warfare. Is this to include biological and chemical? A bit closer to home, some Australians have used what happened in order to unleash their hatred of Muslims. A school bus was stoned, a mosque fire-bombed, and there have been other similar instances of racism. Who are these people? We must cross them in the street yet looking at someone it is impossible to tell that they harbour such hatred (and are so illogical). It also frightens me that our PM looks like being re-elected on an issue which is actually unrelated to this one, but has been made to seem related. Before the attacks took place, there were some refugees from Afghanistan (and other places) on a boat in Indonesian waters heading for Australia. They were picked up by a Norwegian boat which started to bring them to Australia, but they were refused entry by our government. A court decision ruled that our government had acted wrongly and that the refugees were to come to Australia (just to be processed - not necessarily to be given the right to stay). The government appealed this decision and had it reversed. Even the opposition leader supported the rejection of these people, who have since been taken to Nauru (although many refuse to disembark there). This is such a complicated issue, but the thing that is relevant here is that after the bombings, some people started saying things along the lines of it being a good thing that these people were not let in (in other words, that all Afhanistanis are terrorists). Apart form deploring the stupidity of those who swallow this, I despise the politicians who play on it. These include in one form or another members from both main parties, and also the coalition partner of the main one. It seemed to anyone who thought about it even clearer (if ever there was any doubt) that the asylum seekers really had something to flee from - and thus that we in \'the lucky country\' (immigrants all of us bar a small population that is dying out) had an obligation to do what we could for them. Instead, laws have been altered making it more difficult for refugees to enter Australian waters, and also more difficult to have their applications to stay accepted on grounds of persecution. I am truly ashamed of this on my country\'s behalf. Naturally it concerns me that a people already war torn, hungry, poor and so on feel that they must flee their country because of the threat of US retaliation. I hope that their fears are unjustified, and that the US is not going to involve itself in the hypocrisy of killing civilians. My hope is not great, considering past and continuing acts of aggression (such as crop dusting in Colombia which is killing civilians). It seems that the future of these people is uncertain at best. Where will they run? Australia, apparently, is not an option. I feel for the citizens of the US. As I mentioned earlier, I have friends there living in Chicago and NY. They are considering moving back here, which I sincerely hope they do. But how many US citizens have this as an option? Today on the radio chemical and biological warfare were being discussed. Apparently in England people are buying gas masks, fearing some kind of danger of that sort over there. In addition to any real attacks they might suffer, I fear that there could be psychological damage done in the States in terms of becoming paranoid, always looking over one\'s shoulder. What a way to live. As a final sort of summary, I think that while the world is divided in terms of wealth as it is, the underdogs will always rebel. Why aim to maintain this divide? Is it necessarily the case that if others are to come up to our level of wealth (particularly in terms of education and health) that we with good levels already must suffer? Is it necessary to respond violently at all? It seems to me a good leader (like Ghandi) doesn\'t just look at short term \'solutions\', rather leads an honourable way of life. This does not include seeking revenge (although it may involve preventing further attacks in the sense of imprisoning those who have been involved in them before). It certainly isn\'t the case that ongoing war (such as we see in Northern Ireland) is in any sense a solution. Rather, the people fighting now are some generations down the track, and they will probably give rise to further bitter war-torn generations. Is it possible to understand why the US is hated in many parts of the world? This question is not to justify what happened, rather to ask what possible motivation could such an attack have had? Personally I find it easy to understand why the US as a big ambiguous whole is resented. It is unfortunate because the \'enemy\' here is so ill-defined. It is not the people who died that are responsible for giving the US a bad name. It is those who say that it is OK to place trade-sanctions which ultimately result in the deaths of many civilians (e.g., in Iraq) and others who are involved with similar atrocities. Why should those in the WTC have to die for them? Why should civilians in Afghanistan die because of the Taliban or bin Laden or whoever was responsible? Finally, the only good thing I can think of in connection with this whole response is that perhaps the people of Afghanistan will be liberated. Is this a possibility? They certainly could do with a bit of help. Will women be able to show their hair in public again some time in the future? Also, I think that it would be wrong to let things get out of perspective in terms of military spending and closing borders. It simply delays understanding when we take a cold war (and especially a hot war) approach to dealing with others. Russia is now joining forces with the US - who would have imagined that 30 years ago? \"Lots of reasons - mainly resentment but also illogical thinking and religious fundamentalism (in the sense of not tolerating and appreciating the religion/atheism of others).I feel more strongly that it is up to each of us to  make a difference ; to treat other people with the respect that we would like to have extended to us.\"If it is the Taliban, they feel they are doing what is right.  Just as we, the United States of America, feel we are doing  what is right .....\"\"Could not believe it when told by apt. maintenance worker in my parking lot...went inside and turned on the TV...watched the plane fly into the first building....once saw a  re-run  and the plane was backed out of the building and then they forwarded the scene and it flew into it all over again.  Disbelief!  Total Disbelief!  It was like watching a Bruce Willis movie...I felt in shock. It made me want to be near my family and call my friends to just say hello and let them know I care about them.  Later, I watched the recovery efforts and wished we, as a world, could work together like those helping in the recovery effort.  There was no mention of how many workers were men vs women, black vs white, straight vs gay.....they were just human beings, working non-stop to find victims.  If nothing else comes of this, the fact that we  came together  as people was important.  \"\"From what I read, I assume the Taliban.  But, without knowing the facts, that is just an assumption.  I do not feel like war is the answer.  There are innocent people being killed ... just like innocent people were killed in the attack on 9-11.  And, for what?  Will that end terrorism?  I doubt it.  If it is the Taliban and we kill them all...there will be others that take replace them.  War and killing are not the answers.  Somehow we need to strive for peace and understanding..tolerance of others who are  different  than us.  The world is a big place..one would think people could learn to coexist peacefully.  \"\"I watched the events unfold on TV as I\'d just got in from work. I live in UK so it was mid afternoon here. It all seemed so unreal, so unbelievable, just like watching a film. Only this time Bruce Willis wasn\'t there to sve the day! Then the kids came home and I had to try and explain it to them. They\'re 10 and 7 so I had to explain that although it was probably Muslim terrorist who had dome it that didn\'t mean all Muslims were bad. It was in trying to explain it to them that I began to really feel it myself. Just immense sadness really and worry about what was going to happen next. Did I need to go and stock up with supplies. I did go and fill up the tank of the car with petrol (there were queues developing by 5pm). I  just felt numb over the next few days. Everytime the TV was on there were more views from different angles of the planes crashing. Then there were the reports of the Mobile phone calls from passsengers on the planes and people inthe buildings. The benefits of modern technology! Over the next days I just began to feel angry. I feel most angry with the people who openly speak out and say America deserved it. We have Muslim extermists in UK who openly support Bin Laden.  Why are they here, why does out Government allow them to stay here when all they want to do is destroy our way of life, values and liberties. I feel angry with our Government who are not acting speedily enough.  So I suppose anger is my main emotion over the last couple of weeks. There\'s fear as well. We\'re a small country, if we\'re attacked with nerve gas, biological or nucleur weapons there will be nowhere to hide. \"I\'m more wary of ethnic minoroty people who are not personally known to me.  I will not visit London in the near future.Islamic Terrorists and all the states who support them or fail to condemn them.Because they are power hungry zealots who cannot allow the existence of any world view except their own.\"i was shocked and appalled when i heard the news.  it was scary to think that our great country may not be safe anymore.  we\'ve never had to live among war, and i\'d hate to think we have to now.  i was also sad at the amount of anti-arab sentiment.  being of slight arabic descent, i take offense.  i hate how people can generalize one small group of freaks and claim that everyone from the same side of the world is just like that.  honestly, what if the rest of the world thought that everyone who was white was like the kkk?  what about those of us who wholeheartedly don\'t agree with their views?  what about people in countries like canada and even england and sweden?  they\'re white, too.  but they have nothing to do with it.  so why can\'t we let it go.  also, people are so quick to see that people in countries like palestine were cheering.  well, we were really mean to the people in palestine.  so they don\'t like us.  not that they did anything to us, and were cheering over our dead, but they wanted to see our great super power get some of our own medicine.  \"osama bin laden and company\"because in their belief, to die making a statement is a great honor.  and the usa is always in other countries\' business, so most of the smaller developing countries don\'t like us.\"not muchI am much more cautious of people and I feel more pride for my countryThey are jealous of everything that we have accomplished.  Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban and probably a lot of Afghanistan people\"After watching the events on September 11, I was in shock for a couple of days.  I felt as if the whole thing was a nightmare.  After it started to sink in that this was reality, I was scared that the attacks weren\'t over.  I feared for my family and for my future.  I then began to get really angry.  I think I am still angry that someone would do this to us... more specifically to ME.  I took it very personally.  I felt like it was an attack on me and my beliefs.  I am still so very angry and wish revenge on all those responsible.  I am scared for our Americans who are over in the middle east right now because I don\'t want them to be lost for this cause.  I realize that what is going on but know that is has to be done to protect our country.  I also think that in some sad way, this tragedy has made it possible for my future to be a better one in the long run.  While I am afraid for the near future, later on the U.S. could be a much safer place.  Also, I see a more united nation which makes me feel very proud to be an American. \"',4,-5,0,2,5,0.6,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0,0,1.19,0,8.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.17,2.38,0,1.19,2.38,0.6,0,0,5.36,0,0,0,0.6,0,0,2.08,0.6,35.73,0,1.79,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,41.1,3.57,0,2.38,0,0,0,0,0,1.79,0,0,0.6,0,0,11.91,5.37,6.55,0,0.6,0,5.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,Female49bb
'if we knew this than it probably wouldn\'t be an issue now would it?0I watch CNN less because I cannot stand to listen to this 24-7I am still a little in shock-three weeks later. I do not think that I fully understand the long-term ramifications of an attack such as this.  I also refuse to let them win by letting this consume my every thought and act. My life must go on and the actions of these men cannot change my freedom or my choice to be in the USPowerI am still not able to really grasp what happened.  I sometimes get a real insight into just how many people died.  It only lasts a few seconds.  I still can\'t believe it.I see the pictures of the towers gone... It almost becomes real.   I have become much more patriotic.  Osma Bin Ladin\"I read more newspapers, I watch more tv (dutch news, CNN, BBC news) I talk a lot about war/politics/history/social psychology with others I get weird feeling when plane flying over..\"Bin Laden and his organisation (but that opion comes from the media and who knows...maybe it are no Muslims after all...McVeigh comes to mind)\"To kill Americans, to show power to the world, to unstabalize   western economies, to bring war between western countries and Middle-Eastern countries, to express feelings of hate, to give hope to people who feel suppressed by western countries, to make a point against capitalism and militarism (so, it could be an anti-globalism-group or anarchistic organisation as well)\"\"I feel and think a lot... The attacks were horrible.  I feel sad for all those innocent people who got injured and killed  and for all their families and friends. I feel cold when I see images  or pictures of people jumping out of the WTC, pictures of wounded,  pictures of the complete mess, of crying people. I feel weird about  the WTC not being there anymore. Like a lot of Europeans, I\'ve been on  top and the fact that the places where you have been are not there  anymore make the tragedy more close and at the same time, harder to  belief. I loved to be in New York (last year, october and december).  It was immediately high on my top-ten list of favorite cities.  I loved the athmosphere and the people there. That makes the attack on  that city and those people more emotional for me personally. I know people in New York and although none of them got injured,  I feel sorry for them.  At the same time, I feel a hypocrite, for feeling sorry for those  involved in this attack and having less emotions when hearing about  attacks and wars elsewhere in the world....   I wonder what makes people so disciplined to carry out these attacks... To practice flying, to study, to plan, for many years...Without drawing attention.. These people have been working on this for years, knowing that they would going to die... They must have been brainwashed or they must realy realy realy belief very strong in their ideas...But when I saw those kids (11 , 12 years old) on tv in camps of Bin Laden, I understood that youcan be this disciplined, because these kids are raised with the idea that the purpose of their life is to commit suicide  in order to kill Americans... And that, wel, that is just awfull! it is horrible! It reminds me of the nazis. And we all know how national socialsm could rise in Germany: the Germans felt humiliated after  the first world war, there was poverty, economical crisis, inflation, people got no jobs, no future for their kids, and than: a strong leader...So, we have to learn from history...These terrorists have found soil for their crual ideas, people in some Middle East countries must feel humiliated, there is poverty... Bombing some countries will not be enough! Killing Bin Laden will not be enough... I\'m afraid of what is coming. I\'m not very afraid of bombs or other  attacks in the Netherlands (although I belief we could be a target ourselves as well). I\'m more afraid of the coming events in the Middle East. I\'m glad there has not been an attack in Afghanistan very soon after the 11th, because that makes me more hopeful that the world leaders (and especially the leaders of the US) do not act without thinking it over very very well. I feel sorry for all Muslim and Arabic people who came to the US or Europe to flee for  the goverments back in their home-countries and are attacked now. I think the attacking and discrimination  of muslims and Arabics is very wrong. At the same time, I think everyone feels so powerless, and some people just can\'t handle their helpless anger and have the feeling they have to do something for their country  and act out of frustration in a  way that hurts muslims. I\'m afraid that in our country tensions between different cultures will grow. I\'m afraid for what is going to happen when Afghanistan will be attacked. I would not mind the Taliban to be \'hunted down\' (you realy hear horrible stories about the behavior of the Taliban, especially against women), but I feel very sorry for all those Afghans who are suppressed by the Taliban  and do not have the money or opportunities  to flee, and they will be again (!) victim of a war. I\'m afraid for civil war in Pakistan. I\'m afraid for support of our western countries to  other scary undemocratic regimes in Uzbekistan, Kazachstan, Turkmenistan et cetera: when we will support them now, because we need them to attack Afghanistan, maybe they will be our next enemy...What are you doing when you are supporting regimes against other regimes? The US supported Iraque in the war against Iran, they supported the muslim alliances in Afghanistan against the USSR, and now Iraque proofed to have a psychopath as a leader and the Taliban are using American weapons against it\'s own people. History is so complex! All small and major events have something to do with one other, everything can have a minor or major influence on other events. So, what do we have to do??? I know that the US (and their friends) have to do something, but what? Groundtroops in Afghanistan? Too dangerous. Only air-attacks?  Too ineffective. But what else? I don\'t know. I\'m very glad I\'m not in a position to make decisions. But I\'m afraid of the wrong decisions. And my guess is, that whatever decision will be made, it will proof to be the wrong one...for there is no good decision in this situation. I\'m scared that whatever will happen now, this will have major effects on histrory and that those effects are not so positive for the western world. I\'m afraid of Pakistan claiming Kashmir in return for helping the US, I\'m afraid of India getting angry, (and after all, Pakistan and India are nuclear powers....). I\'m afraid of more terroristic attacks on American and also on European targets, I\'m afraid of a division of the world in a muslim and a \'jewish/christian\' part.  And in a way, I think people who are angry at the US and European countries are right in one thing: we have been very arrogant, we keep on exploiting people in the third world, we only act when we have  an interest in acting (we act when we are attacked, we act when we fear oil-prices to raise, we act when we fear unstability in Europe). We hardly act on behalf of an oppressed community.  We did not act before, while the taliban was oppressing people for a long time. Why act now? Of course we have to act now, but for the people of Afghanistan, this must feel sour. And the whole history of countries and wars goes back such a long time, a lot of events stem from  colonization... So we have a bad image and bombing another country will not help in getting a better image... That\'s why I belief things will only get worse...Whatever we will do now, it will make more people angry and poverty and anger are the soil for terrorism. So, the only way out is developmental aid to third world countries. Investments in feeding the hungry people, educating the unknowing people, sharing our richness with others. And than I feel hypocrite again, I do not want to give up my wealth...I like to live in a nice house, to have nice dinners, to go to see a movie every now and then, to buy new clothes.. But in order to make other people more wealthy, we have to give up some of our wealth... And even if we do, if we divide our richness with people all over the world, will it help? Are we as capitalistic democratic communities the wish of all people all over the earth? I\'m inclined to think so. I\'m inclined to think that all people want a tv, a house, a creditcard, a democratic goverment... But who tells me that this is true? Is it my own western way of thinking? Would all the people in the world be happy to live in countries like ours??? And when I think so, is that the arrogance those people in some Middle East countries are so angry about? And developmental aid...we did it for so long without making countries more democratic. I once had a seminar on development of third world countries. I was taught, that the way we want to develop countries is in an ethical way (by bringing democracy, human rights, women rights, education, equal wealth et cetera all at the same time), but that the real way countries develop is NEVER ethical. In the Netherlands, first the industrials got rich, than the middle class, than the worker class, and things like women rights came only into being after a long time... So, development and ethics bite eachother. And we might not be able to develop other countries and be ethical at the same time and we (western countries) want to be ethical, so we will be unable to develop... Too far strayed away from the subject... So back to some thoughts on the subject: I do not like the way some people speak on tv. i do not like president Bush saying  make no mistake about it , or the war-talks he has been given (  we will smoke those cowardly criminals out of their holes, we will hunt them down and bring them to justice! .  I did not like that he said  wanted dead or alive  and that the countries who are not completely at the side of the US are \'against us\'. There is no war. There has been very severe terroristic attacks. This is not the wild-west, this is a very complex world-crisis.  Black and white thinking, good/bad thinking, it is too simplistic, it will only lead to polarization of things, it will only drive away some nations.  I want to hear more nuances, I want room for critical thinking, for discussion, for people playing the devil\'s advocate without being accused of being a terrorist themselves. Thinking in only one direction, ruling out the possibility for critique,  will lead to groupthink, and will lead to stupid decisions. I get uneasy feelings with all the stars and stripes flying on my tv-screen...Though I can understand feelings of chauvinism (and I hope feelings of uniformity will be advantageous for minorities in the US), it will be oil on the fire of people who were already not very warmhaerted for the US. I do not like Americans on tv saying that the US are the most democratic country in the world or the most free country of the world. I was in the US for four months (during the elections last year) and I agree: there is a lot of freedom and I liked a lot of things in the US, but I seriously doubted the democracy after the elections (with those stories of black people not given the opportunity to vote, boxes of votes being missed, vague voting-bills, et cetera) and I belief social security is a lot better in some parts of Europe than it is in the US, and there is more freedom when you have more money...My point here is not  to critisize the US policies (the Netherlands also have a lot of habits and rules to critisize), but to make clear, that when I as a European get a bit irritated when hearing chauvinistic talks of American leaders, I can imagine people in the Middle East bursting with anger! I belief worldleaders have to be very  careful in choosing their words in public, because not only their own  civilians are listening, the whole world is listening!!! I belief those words can be good for the people who are involved in this dramatic events, but those words are NOT GOOD to be heard by people in other nations, who have doubst about the US.    I am glad to hear that also in the US people are discussing a war, are discussing what has to happen. That also in the US, people do not like all those American flags and that some people gathered for anit-war demonstrations. I think that our country has to be at the side of the US, cause we are \'friends\' and American militaires gave their lives at the end of WOII to save us from the nazis. At the same time, I would like our goverment to be able not to agree on every move the US leaders want to make. i do not belief that whatever the US think is the right thing to do IS indeed the right thing to do. By saying \'who is not at our side is against us.\' president Bush put countries like the Netherlands in a nasty position. I think the European, Asian and African countries must be listened to when they have other opinions on how to act.  I do not want to be called a terrorist or a friend of the terrorists when I do not agree completely with US-policies. I\'m afraid for an economical crisis which will also influence my personal life.  The thing I\'m most afraid of, is that what is happening is EXACTLY what these terrorists wanted to happen! I\'m afraid that this economical crisis is what they wanted, that racism and discrimination is what they wanted, that fear is what they wanted, that war is what they wanted. I\'m afraid they hoped for a war of western countries against Middle East countries. That is one reason I belief we should not get involved in a war. Please mister Bush, think very carefully! Please mister Powell, do not attack countries. Please, try to have very small military actions, try only to get down those training-camps, try to get rid of as many terroristic cells  you can get, try to get after Bin Laden and his organisation, try to use intelligence more than weapons. And please try to give people in third world countries a better life. ALSO the Palestinians in Israel! They deserve more support from western countries. They are not all \'bad\' and they are all being driven from their lands, humiliated, attacked, and manipulated with no access to water-supplies.  I wished this attack just would not have happened! \"I don\'t know enough to blame anyone specifically.I tell my loved ones how much they mean to me more often.  I have taken an interest in the news.  I have learned to appreciate my country more.  We are so lucky.I have learned the question  why  is impossible to answer.  \"I attend a small liberal arts university and the assumption on campus is that we don\'t know what goes on outside our campus walls.  That we have an imaginary wall that surrounds and protects us.  On September 11th, I realized our nation saw the U.S to be that way as well.  We are unaware of what goes on an ocean away.  Until it hits our homeland...our soil.  Suddenly, we are faced with the question, how could someone do such an awful act toward us?  It becomes a eye opening experience.  It has caused so much pain and suffering in millions of people, not only in our nation, but across the world.  And the beauty?  We have come together.  We have finally started to take our eyes off the wall and look through it instead. We have come together, tear to tear, flag to flag, hand in hand.  Under the hurt, there is beauty...\"\"I watched almost all of the events unfold live on TV, since I had turned on the news at 7:45am CST when the first attack was still being covered as a terrible airline accident.  As I watched the coverage, heard eye-witnesses tell about the second plane, and realized that this was not simply a horrible accident, I simply sat in shock and horror on my couch.  It seemed absolutely unimaginable to me that these attackes could be intentional, and then the news came of the other two planes that crashed, whch just made everything worse.  Although I was removed from the attack sites, I was devastated by the attacks, cried most of Tuesday and Wednesday, and felt ill when thinking about what had happened.  Ever since last Tuesday, I have had trouble concentrating and going about life  as usual  because life *isn\'t* usual anymore.   I am so incredibly saddened and hurt by the attacks -- but not angry.  I feel as though every particle of my soul hurts for the human race.  How is it that people can harbor so much hatred and hostility towards others that they are willing to sacrifice their own lives as well as the lives of innumberable innocent vistims?  I honestly cannot wrap my mind around that.  I cannot imagine a situation in which I coul *ever* hate anyone or any group or any country that much.   It fills me with despair that the lack of cultural understanding and appreciation in the world today -- and here I will especially single out Americans, who tend to be more self-focused than many others in the international community -- has led to this event.  Because no matter what other factors were causes of this attack -- religious beliefs, economic imbalances, foreign policy decisions -- it really comes down to the fact that we as people don\'t know how to relate to and understand those who are different from us, in race, national origin, religious beliefs, etc.  I wish that there would be fewer attempts to place blame on others and more willingness to take responsibility for our own actions and our own contribution to this international atmosphere of intolerance and disdain.  And I find it almost equally horrible that some American citizens have taken it upon themselves to launch verbal or physical assaults on fellow Americans who are of Arab/Middle Eastern descent or who follow the teachings of Islam.  The group of terrorists who executed (literally and figuratively) this attack are a small group of fanatic extremists and do not represent Muslims or Afghanis in general.  Why can\'t more people understand that?   And why can\'t more Americans remember that the people who died in this attack were *not* just from the US?  There were many people from other countries who were directly affected by these attacks, and we need to remember that this is not just a  war on America  but rather a war on anyone who does not agree with the terrorists.  If there is any hope in fighting against these terrorists, we need to form coalitions with other countries and we cannot accomplish this if we keep referring to  America\'s New War.   This is *not* a war -- this is a struggle that will most likely begin with a show of force but which needs to be continued through diplomatic efforts.  After all, if the terrorists were willing to sacrifice themselves and innocent others, they certainly won\'t care if we attack the countries that have harbored them and kill innocent citizens in those countries.  These terrorists don\'t value human life in general, and waging  war  on certain countries that we mistakenly perceive as our  enemies  will only add to the bloodshed and will not elicit any satisfactory response from the terrorists, nor will it deter terrorists from taking similarly horrible actions in the future.  Already, we have seen our international partners begin to back off from their initial pledges of support because Bush\'s rhetoric has continued to focus on war, warfare, etc.  The governing/ruling parties in other countries recognize and accept that this type of response will not be effective in the long run, and if Bush continues to harp on this type of action, we will lose more of our support in the international community and any action we take will be ineffective. The best way to summarize how I feel is that I hurt enormously -- intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.  The attacks created a chasm in my life:  on one side was my life up to that horrible day, and on the other side is my life now.  I knew how to function in that other life, what to do, how to react, but I don\'t yet know how to do all of that now.  I feel as though I\'m still trying to navigate through the world and determine how the things that I used to find important -- work, writing my dissertation -- can continue to be important.  At the moment, such concerns seem incredibly trivial in the context of last Tuesday\'s attacks.   A few days ago, we had a beautiful fall day here in Wisconsin -- clear blue sky, crisp cool weather, leaves starting to turn flaming colours -- and I hurt looking at the beauty of the world around me.  How can such beauty coexist with such evil?  How can my world still look so much the same when so much has changed?  I really do weep for all of us, because I don\'t think that anyone alive last Tuesday has not been somehow affected by these attacks.  Perhaps this  wake-up  call has been late in coming to the US, since people in other countries have been living with the fear of terrorist attacks for many years.  But the fact remains that the US is, for good or bad, the one remaining super-power, so that a devestating attack on this country has enormous ramifications around the globe.  My most fervent hope and wish is that this will make everyone more aware of how cultural ignorance and intolerance threatens the very fabric of our world, and that we *all* need to do our part to improve international relationships, not just among governments but among ordinary people as well.  Perhaps *especially* among ordinary people.\"0\"Despite all of the reasons offered by the media,politicans, and analysts, I honestly don\'t know why someone would do this.

Seeing all the different videos of the event, shook me to the bone.  Hearing the stories of my friends who worked in those buildings made me cry.  The other day I was at a grocery store and saw an Arab man.  I couldn\'t believe that I couldn\'t take my eyes off of him.

'\"I feel fairly certain the evidence points to bin Laden, but I would not bet my life on it.\"\"I fear flying, for a few weeks any sound of a fire alarm or emergency vehicle scared me, I am watching more television and listening to the radio to get updates.\"To incite the US into an unwinnable war.\"The first thing I reacted to was the sense of complete vulnerability that I\'m left with following these attacks.  It is almost unfathamable that my routine life is so fragile, when it feels so stable and permanent.  I could have had my family members killed, I could have been on an airplane one day by sheer  luck  and never have the opportunity to see my son grow.  It took a while for me to focus on the  everydayness  of my life.  Now, a month after the attacks, that has returned to some extent. Now I am left wondering what the hell we are doing as a country... I\'m primarily concerned that we are out seeking  justice  in a way that will only add to the tragedy of the situation rather than truly prevent such a reoccurence.  The velocity with which the US began military attacks on Afghanistan concerns me.  I find it difficult to see what the point of these attacks are; although I understand the propaganda that is being transmitted daily is supposed to assure me we are on top of things and  getting the bad guys.   I want the people responsible to be punished, killed even, but I am very uncertain we are actually accomplishing that.  In addition, I fear we are playing right into a game plan.  Americans are not known for their patience.  These people planned the attacks for over a decade; and in three weeks we respond with bombs.  Was that not a predictable response?  Of course!  There was no question that such an affront would result in military action, that might incite a tremendous battle both in the middle east and on our home front.  We are a nation of privilege; we do not know war (I speak mostly for the  younger  generation, of which I am part).  We idealize Rambo and Hollywood portrayals of action and violence, having no memory of the tragedies that accompany these.  We are not concerned with understanding the WHY of the attacks, only the WHO and ARE THEY DEAD YET? I cannot bring myself to fly the flag on my car, as so many here have done.  I grieve privately for my own friends who\'ve lost loved ones in the tragedies.  I have family in DC that were, thank goodness, safe.  I have volunteered to help those who grieve in our school mental health clinic.  But I cannot endorse the sort of testosterone-driven, violent, impulsive action we\'ve taken.  Who are we really fighting?  The whole point of terrorism is that it has no identifiable roots and borders.  We are worse off than Vietnam soldiers were in the Viet Cong!  We are out in the open, an open target, trying to shoot an invisible enemy.  No one here wins in that situation. I fear flying home for the holidays, although to drive would mean more than 20 hours.  I hate this.\"\"Bin laden and his associates. However, the US has to reflect on its foreign policiy. Noone is truly innocent; there needs to be refelction on the part of the  supernations \"\"I was truly shocked by what happened last Tuesday. It was shocking to me that a plane could be used as a bomb. I was truly devasted at the loss of life and those who had lsot loved ones, particularly the fireifighters. However, I was  not surprised that terrorism had finally reached the US and I believed that Bin Laden was invovled. I am a Brit livign in Colorado and lived in London for 6 years during the IRA bombings. I was particularly upset by the tragedy because it reminded me of some the London bombings particularly those in the City. \"\"BIn Laden believes that the US is the devil incarnate and that through ridding the world of US citizens or by keeping the US out of the Middle East, the world would be a purer place. \"My behavior has not changed. \"When I first heard it, I immediately thought of the horror that those involved must have experienced.  I told myself that it was over, within minutes, I heard that the Pentagon had been hit.  I have spent time in D.C. and stayed one week within about a mile of the Pentagon. Within minutes, the experience got even more personal when the Pa. plane went down only a few miles from my husband\'s birth place. Next, was the overwhelming sense of emotion I experienced as the second WTC tower came down.  I had seen the first, and just kind of accepted it, I guess it was because I had numbed myself.  But when the second came down, I actually stopped and said a prayer.  I then found myself sitting and listening, but not watching the television. After this, my thoughts began to turn toward my family and children. I called my husband to make sure he was o.k. We are both federal employees and work on opposite sides of town.  My children, I felt were safe at their schools. But as a federal employee at one of the few agencies that remained open that day I felt a sense of uneasiness. Next I thought about my two nieces, one who works near the Pentagon, and the other who spends much of her time in Manhattan--where were they, were they o.k?  Fortunately they were both fine. I went back to my office and sat at my desk, as I looked out the window, I saw the flags--now at half staff.  A sense of forlorn over took me.  Periodically throughout the day, I would see local police and the fire marshall enter and leave the grounds. As the day progressed, patients called, and we talked.  I helped them process their own issues.  When I got home, my 13 year old son was there full of questions and asking,  Did they find out who did it yet ?  A simple no was all I could answer.   At one point, I was part of a group that was on standby to be sent in to do critical incident debriefing.  I wasn\'t so threatened by the thought of going, but I also knew that if I did go, I wouldn\'t be the same upon my return.  I called my parents and a close friend who I consider my  other mother  and told them to prepare that I might have to go.  I guess I was actually preparing myself. As the days have passed, I have spent much of my time assisting my patients in processing the horror.  I still feel a sense of horror for the families of those who are lost.  I anticipate that most may never be found.  How tragic.  I feel fearful when I think about the fact that this is not over.  I think about my children.  I lived through Vietnam.  I see patients daily who experienced permanent trauma from Vietnam and Desert Storm.  I don\'t want that for my children. I hope and pray they are not drafted. On the other hand, I feel as if I can\'t allow myself to be overtaken by the fear.  I let my life move on.  I am a little concerned by a trip that my husband has to make to Boston this fall, but I also realize that while the events of this month have diminished me, I cannot let them stop me.  I guess this moving on is a way to deal with the shock and denial of the whole affair.  When I her two hour news cast that focus solely on the events of 9/11, I feel angry--let us move on and just hush. I ask the Lord to protect me and those I love.\"\"I really feel that this is in part a result of jealousy.  When people for other countries hear about America, all they see is the  land of opportunity . They never hear of our slums and our own poverty.\"none\"Obviouslly terrorist, I am still waiting for evidence that directly points toward Bin Laden.\"\"pure hatred, a huge amount of jealousy that has turned into anger and reason to kill or injure, evility, possiblity of being brainwashed by authority, being forced by authority\"Usama Bin Ladin and his terrorist groups from the Middle East\"I have realized that the problems I had were not important because people in N.Y., and Washington lost their lives.  I also realized that ANYTHING can happen, even to us good people.  Belief in a just world, NO LONGER appears in my book. \"\"Actually, in the beginning I didn\'t even believe it really happened.  My mother woke me up at about 9:45 a.m. and told me what happened just an hour earlier.  I was groggy so I didn\'t respond well, but I tried to go back to sleep and I couldn\'t do it after I realized what she had really said.  I watched the television all day and didn\'t even notice how late it was getting.  Later on that day I went outside to feed my cats and realized how quiet it was outside.  It was like the whole world stopped.  The usual airplanes that I hear weren\'t flying overhead and I couldn\'t hear the children running and playing at the park.  It was an  eerie  kind of quiet.  \"Yes\"I would have to start off by saying my prayers are with each and every individual that was effected by this tragic event. Maybe a mom was lost or dad, sister, brother, niece, nephew, cousin, uncle, aunt, grandparent, co-worker, employee, etc... I have lost many family members in the recent years and I can sympathize with a tragic event. My sister was in a car accident killing her and my brother-in-law and today I am still greiving! Take the amount of people that lost their lives mutiply that by two or three then you have the number of people that are having a terrible time with this. Every time I think about it I can\'t help but cry for as long as the thoughts keep going through my mind. I do and will say a prayer for those families, friends and so forth for that day and for the rest of my life. I believe that is the best way I can give my help because I know a man named Jesus that answers my prayers. He\'ll not only answer mine but he will also answer yours. We don\'t know or understand why these things happen but in the end we will survive! No matter how many things go wrong in my life, I will survive, because theirs a higher power to help me go on.\"Osama Bin LaudenMentally ill',4,-4,0,2,5,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,0,2.17,0,0,0,0,10.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.17,4.33,0,0,1.08,2.17,0,0,7.58,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0.54,0,31.42,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,2.17,0,36.84,5.42,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,1.08,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,8.68,5.42,3.25,0,0,0,4.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female49bb
'Some left-wing Islamic group\"Bin Laden is angery with the U.S. for being an alli with Isreal. Also the events in the Persian Gulf War. In addition, the hit us in our symbolic monuments of greed and power. \"\"The attack on the United States on September 11, has forever changed the way people feel secure. The U.S. has been the  safe haven  for millions around the world for centuries. People come here for many reasons but for one in particular is security.  Now that has changed. The terrorist have enplaced terror into the minds of Americans, they have made us fearful of flying nad to some even prejucice towards Muslims and people of Middle East descent.  I do believe we will overcome some of those fears but we will never forget. I was in shock for about three days after the attack I could not show any emotions what-so-ever.  I could not believe the thousands of lives that were lost. The Moms and Dads, neighbors, friends,and humans, they all had goals not yet accopmlished. I keep telling myself that good comes out of a bad situation, well I think we all have seen it. The unity of all coming together to donate blood, write checks, and volunteer. Also to the brave laborers,firefighters and policemen that have been working since the very hour terror struck.  I think  people have taken a step back to re-evaluate their goals, motivations and behaviors.   IN GOD WE TRUST--UNITED WE STAND\"?\"Another good question.  I do not understand a hatred so deep that the attackers could live and train with us for two years and still take 6,500 lives.  If you figure it out, please let me know. \"I have been unable to concentrate on work.\"Good Question.  From the media coverage, all of the hijackers have Arab/Middle Eastern names.  I recognize that such a well coordinated attack requires a good support structure.  However,  I have not seen sufficient evidence unconvering the organization.    Some people have suggested that the United States is responsible for this attack.  One such argument suggests that the CIA had to know about the attack, they being an infailable organization, and let it proceed in order to further U.S. interests in the middle east.  I have  never been exposed to such idiocy before.  Others feel that the U.S.  deserved the attack for their strong arming tactics around the world. While, I agree that the United States government is not above reproach  in its foreign policy, no country or people deserve to have airliners  crash into their buildings.  Just as they don\'t deserve car bombers,  suicide bombers, chemical warfare, assasinations, etc. \"0religious zealotsa charasmatic leader has twisted their religion and used the many problems that US foreign political action has created as their excuse for attacking us\"have thought about a plan in case more attacks happen in northeast, will try to live in the moment more \"\"How can I put all my thoughts into one small space, in one sitting? I\'m mortified and full of despair. For the suffering experienced by the people on the planes and in the attacked buildings. For the sadness of their families and friends. For the hope and then grief felt by the rescue workers, day after day. And for humanity, I feel loss. This is just the punctuation mark on millenia of abuses to one another largely in the name of religion (though oft intertwined with politics and territoriality -- hard separating them), and signals ongoing killing in the name of what? I have often said that the people in this world who want to kill each other over their land, religion, or ideology should just get into a big field, destroy each other, and then leave behind the people who are capable and interested in peace -- and I urge this in the middle east, in northern ireland, and every other continent or country where there are decades or centuries of bloodshed. Lastly, I\'m glad I haven\'t brought any children into this world.\"I am more aware of the US\'s foreign policies Osama Ben-ladenAt first I was really surprised. I didn\'t know that the U.S. had any  enemies . I was shocked and felt really helpless.

I am afraid that it is going to happen again. The fear is subsiding as time passes. However, I believe that the terrorists are not going to give up on trying to destroy us.

If we go to war, we are doing the same thing they did to us. There are some people that are not involve in this. I think that we should find the people that did this and punish them. I feel real bad for those family who had families and friends in the World Trade Center.\"nonebecause usa has alot of powerAlOT PEOPLE\"Because they didn\'t have anything to lose except their life, and nothing to live for except their hate.\"\"I don\'t think we really have an answer yet. Before strong evidence comes in, I think it\'s premature to pin blame on more than the people who can be identified as suicide hijackers.   I think pinning it specifically on Bin Laden may or may not work, but I think he told the truth when he said that he didn\'t plan it, but thought it was a great idea--see, he\'d set people up with the ideas, the know-how, the focused anger at America, but let the individual small cells come up with the specific attacks themselves. So in a way he\'s both responsible and has clean hands (if the scenario I\'ve just outlined actually resembles the true facts of the situation, which I\'m not sure have been established). \"\"My first reaction was shock and disbelief; then I couldn\'t get my mind off of how many people must have died--this was before I heard any proper news coverage of the events.  I wonder what were the strategic purposes behind these attacks. What would it accomplish to make the American gov\'t both mad and unified? Or were they only interested in causing as much mayhem as possible, by exploiting America\'s most basic fears/obsessions: planes falling out of the sky, and random bystanders being killed in random acts of violence, in places normally thought of as safe. But most of America is far too ignorant of the rest of the world and what our foreign policies really mean. A symptom of this is the complete lack of substantial debate about foreign policy during last year\'s election season. Another symptom is the generally lousy coverage of the rest of the world in our national media; even the pretty good outlets (I\'m thinking NPR, New York Times, etc.) often don\'t even cover the BBC\'s top headlines. If America really knew what was happening out there in the world, often in the name of the USA, the government wouldn\'t get away with the kind of actions that make people so desperate, with nothing left to lose, that they\'re willing to sacrifice their lives just to make a point about their feelings about how much they hate the US. The problem is that more violence is not the answer. The threat of more violence may extract some terrorists from some countries, but the idea of stomping out violence by sheer force and excess security has been tried in Israel, and all it does is breed more--and worse violence. Racheting up government surveillance on the many good just to catch the few evil, in my mind, is going too far. We\'ll lose what\'s made this country great. \"\"I\'ve had trouble concentrating on my own work; my thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost friends and family. I\'m seriously considering cancelling a planned trip to New York at the end of next week, partly cause I always get scared when a plane crashes, partly because I\'m not sure that I\'ll be able to get around and do the things I planned, partly because with the disruptions of last week, I need the time for other things. But I have three more trips planned between now and March that involve air travel, and I see no need to change those.   Also, I\'ve restricted my use of the media more than usual, as they\'re all obsessing over this one attack (so *nothing* else has happened at all in the last week?). Life needs to go on, and I think much of the navel gazing in the media isn\'t taking the national conversation in productive directions.\"Bin Ladin\"To create the illusion of power for himself, to put a dent in the most powerful nation in the world for purposes of personal attention, religious glory, and hatred of the freedom the US stands for, freedom he does not have. Terrorists terrorize, that is their goal, to make us afraid, to bring our country down. I think this plan backfired, though unfortunatly many innocent lives were lost.\"\"I did not fly as planned but drove to a destination. However as mentioned previously I have had to emotionally distance myself to prevent further fearful behavior. I am angry and upset but I cannot be scared of terrorists, as that is their purpose.\"\"I have distanced myself due to utter shock and disbelief that this could occur in a nation such as the US. If I didn\'t do this then I would be fearful to move about freely for fear it could happen again anywhere, anytime. Safety and freedom--an illusion? I have no known family or friends that have been hurt or killed in the incidents and it would pain me too much to think about the reality of what has happened to them and their families, and how these incidents will affect all of our lives for generations to come. I am saddened but go on, I probably am a little more interested in the US military\'s agenda but am tired of watching tv and seeing the continued horror and sad, sad stories of loss and personal devestation. Heartwrenching.\"It was a sick way to test the strength of our country.I have found myself appreciating the little things in life more.\"I think what happened on September 11th was a complete tragedy.  I can\'t even begin to imagine how the friends and families of those lost that day feel right now.  It must be a feeling of complete emptiness, as well as rage.  I think that all those responsible for this should be executed, no questions asked.   I have noticed, however, throughout the past week, how much our country can come together in a time of need.

'I have a tinge of sadness with me always.  Life is too short to get mad at someone who cuts you off on the freeway.\"Poor, sheltered, uneducated people who believe the US is to blame for their poverty.\"\"I was truly shocked as I turned on the local news that morning. I was getting ready for work, and I first thought it was just a fire in the Trade Center. As details slowly surfaced, my first thoughts were of loved ones.  I called my mother. Later at work, I called my grandmother to find out if she knew that my uncle (who lives in New York) and my aunt(who travels quite a bit) were okay.  For the first week after the attack, I couldn\'t get enought information.  My husband and I would sit down after work and tell each other any thing new that we heard about the attacks.  I was truly upset about the loss of lives.  Friends started sending me emails that said very prejudicial things about all Muslims.  Referring to them as  towel heads  and  camel riders .  I noticed these comments came from male friends who seemed to want someone to hate and blame for this---I feel it was the  fix-it  mentality that many men have---to have a goal to eliminate the problem.  My husband and I are very open-minded with other cultures and religions.  We just vacationed in Egypt in July and had a wonderful time.  The people were friendlly and I felt they truly liked Americans(knowing tourism drives their economy).  I can not blame the Muslims as a whole.  I felt a need to defend Islam at work, when coworkers would also say derogatory statments.  I tried to equate it to the crazy Americans who make militia groups like the one found in Waco,Texas.  I am very uneasy as to what the outcome of fighting a losing battle will do to the country.  I feel there will always be groups who hate America.  We can never eliminate our enemies but only create more with violence.  I wish for a more defensive nature.  Security needs to be increased in this country.  I saw police with machine guns everywhere in Egypt(even on our Nile Cruise ship) as well as in Italy and Mexico.  I actually felt safer due to their presence.  Our country needs to have more visible security in all public places.  Also, I do not believe in closing our borders since that is what has made our country what it is.  However, we need to have more screening of visa applicants and control the borders so that illegal passage does not occur.  Now, it is two weeks after the attacks and I am burnt out of hearing and seeing the devastation.  I only watch the news to hear what might be our next step, because it will truly tear the country apart.  There will only be more loss on both sides.  The  Hitlers  of our time, I fear, will survive but their followers will perish. After this, I am truly proud and lucky to be an American.  I truly appreciate the freedoms and opportunities we have from living here.\"\"As mentioned above, they wanted to backlash at the  mighty  US who controls alot of world decisions, when they have no control.  They are uneducated, poor, and brainwashed to the  old school  traditions of their culture.\"\"I don\'t think that I have changed in how I think but I am much more proud of who we are as a people.  I think that previous to this we were beginning to think that we were going downhill as a society and that we would not rise to the occation if it were to present its self, and I think this has show us that compassion for those is need is not something that changes with trends.\"I don\'t know but I don\'t want to be so quick to agree with who everyone claims to  know  who it is.I think that they were trying to get some point across but now with all the anger that has been built up against them is too afraid to come forward.  Either that or they just wanted to be the one to prove that that the United States is not invinsable.\"I think that the events have given young people the passion about their country that they have seen in oder generation but not been able to  understand.  I think that the fact that a small group has been able to hurt the  greatest nation in the world  so sevearly that we are too quick to retaliate and are almost more consumed with find out who is to blame than we are to fix what is a mess here....THEN move on to who did it.  I hope that we do realize that who ever did do this action was acting in and of themselves and not cause world wide action.  My hopes are that our government will be willing to not play to the crowd and do what the American society is all about, in making sure you ahve the right person before you lay blame.\"they do not understand or live their life out of fear - fear based decisions.\"i have more anxiety lately, not knowing what is going to happen next - not feeling as safe overall.

I hope in the future we will be able to prevent such things of happening.I have much more respect for our country.  I understand how important our freedom is and how great of a difference an individual can make.0those who are against the US\"The reasons are many: to kick up a slumping economy (too extreme, perhaps); to gain control over a region that has resouces and military use e.g Afganistan ( that would be better supported by history); to protest American neocolonial world rule; to let other feel the terror they and most of the worlds inhabitants live with each day; perhaps people to these things because we have not yet begun to trully value life and the only planet that supports human life; perhaps people to these things because we are not yet fully human.\"\"I live in NY City, Manhattan to be exact, so this has been very difficult for me, as for most if not all New Yorkers, to process. As I told a coworker, this is like someone telling me that I won 1 trillion dollars - I have no idea of what that is, how many zeros does it get? could I spend that much in one lifetime? - I still have a hard time wrapping my mind around the events of 9/11/01. I have had many discussions with friends, both those who have lost family and coworkers and those who have not, students with whom I work, and myself (I have had many talks with myself since 9/11) trying to process these events. I guess I could list some of my thoughts; that may make it easier to follow. 1. What is peace and am I living a life that exemplifies peace. My thoughts and deeds are being questioned. Am I a beckon of/for peace or not? - there is no in between with this one. 2. As some Americans attack Muslims and Indian looking people I ask myself - When OK City was bommed and Timothy McVey(sp?) was identified as the lone bommer (something I still seriously question) why were no white Christian males between the ages of 25 - 35 attacked? I am not advocating the attacking of anyone; but the questions beg - what gives some Americans license to attack others? what is the criteria for that attack? what holds them back from said attacks? how do we judge who should be attacked and who should not be? 3. In discussions with students at the high school where I work, I found them repeating exactly what they heard on the TV news coverage. Statements such as,  we did nothing wrong   Why do they hate us we didn\'t do anything to them    We\'re innocent   they are jealous of our freedom  to name a few. I found myself explaining to high schoolers our government\'s involvement in terrorist acts worldwide e.g. Latin America, Iraq, Grenada, to name a few. Students were completely unaware of what is done in our name by our government. As I listen to adults justify war I wonder how many of them know what our US government does daily worldwide that creates much of the world poverty and choas and thus hatered of America. 4) As I reread my statements thus far I am struck by the fact that much of it is non-emotional, or intelectual. Had I received this questionnaire last week my responses would have been less head and more heart. 5) Heart: as a New Yorker is it hard for me to think of the city where I\'ve lived for 21 years as no longer having its twin towers. As I mourn the thousands dead, homeless/displaced, unemployed, orphaned I also mourn the loss of my city\'s skyline - now forever changed. 6) Heart: last Saturday was the first morning I awoke and did not resist waking because it felt like waking up into a nightmare. Last Saturday was the first time I accepted the reality. 7) Heart: last Saturday night was the last consecutive night I cried. Now it comes once per day,though not daily.  8) Head: as president Bush talks like John Wayne,  wanted dead or alive  sounds like cowboy talk and not presidential to my ears, I ask: what did the CIA do with its 20 billion dollar budget? How could four planes (we won\'t even talk about the first reports that said there were 8 planes no longer mentioned) just go off course with no one noticing? How could two planes fly into a no fly zone (the WTC/Wall Street area is a no fly zone) and not raise alarm by our FBI, CIA etc.? And what ever happened to that 20 billion dollar CIA budget... feels like Pearl Harbour again but bigger. 9)Head: I have a hard time believing these two things: some group in a third world/southern country could pull this off. This feels,looks, smells, tastes like a military strike. And therein lies the difference between a military and a terrorist group.  I also find it hard to believe that a group of men weilding knives could take over a plane. I live in East Harlem, known as El Barrio or Spanish Harlem, there is no freaking way anybody with a knife could get me to give into their demands - they have to come a lot better equipped than that. 10) Spirit: I comfort friends who have lost family, I try to give knowledge to students to help them understand the larger implications of these events, I help to calm their fears as their brothers, fathers, and cousins go off to war. As I do these things I go back to the words I use to sign my intimate correspondence,  Walk in Peace  and I ask myself if I am doing that - am I today walking in peace? Am I today holding fast to my humanity and not giving into hatered or fear? Am I today practicing compassion even in the face of evil? I have found that I feel no anger about these events I think it is because I have not denied my pain - which is a deep as the sky was blue on the morning of 9/11/01 - and I have challenged myself to live by the words I write. Than you for this opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings. Walk in Peace, Cherrie\"I have no idea. I do not beleve this was done without American help or CIA knowledge.\"Other than crying a lot more and comforting and counseling a lot more not very much.

Also when I hear a commercial plane go overhead I get an eerie feeling.\"Terrorists, people who feel that the U.S. is immoral,folks who believe we are evil, that we are bullies, that we take sides with countries and leaders that perhaps we should not, they think we defile their way of life and their sacred grounds.  Mostly religious fanaticals and leaders who hate the way america does business with the rest of the world.\"\"I watched the events unfold on television while getting my daughter ready for school.  At first I thought it was some horrible accident or movie trailer.  And when the realization of what occurred had actually sunk in, I couldn\'t take my eyes off the news broadcasts or concentrate on  anything else.  Over the course of the next few days I shed tears for all of those unfortunate lives lost or their loved ones left to pick up the pieces of this tragedy.  As warm and loving sentiments were recieved from all over the nation and the world it again brought tears to my eyes to learn of the kindness of others.  I did not personally know any of the victims or families, yet as a fellow American I felt attacked. And I felt their pain...as anyone who has lost a loved one knows the emptiness and sorrow. The sorrow was then followed closely by anger.  Retribution for the murder and destruction....and always the sorrow watching the daily digging at  ground Zero ...as media refers to the site.      I also feel fear here in my own country.  Never before have I considered the possibility of an attack on American soil, now the reality of this assault brings that nightmare to light. I am fearful for my family, my 16 yr old son who may have to go to war, for my way of life.      In the back of my mind I think of the millenium, the crazy notions of the end of the world and wonder if this could actually be a foreshadowing.  I tell myself these are silly notions but the fear still remains.      I am able to go about my daily routines  without difficulty, but I know my life will be forever changed by this event. I pray a little more often, love my country more and wish that we could return to life as it  used to be .     I do not fear riding on an airplane, although I have not been in an airport recently and don\'t look forward to the experience.     I do have some fears that we will be fighting some of this latest war effort on our own soil, and that this could lead to an all out nuclear war...and I guess that would actually be my biggest fear.\"\"They hate americans, they hate the way we live, they think we are Godless, they think we defile their way of life.  They probably also believe that we have treated their country and fellow countrymen with disrespect and have not been fair with their plights.\"That\'s very hard to say. I don\'t thinkt that my mind is able to comprehend the reasoning behind it. Anger? Frustration? Jealousy?I don\'t know that my behaviors have really changed. I guess I\'m paying a little more attention to the news.\"I feel extremely sad about what hapenned on September 11th. It truly came as a shock to me. When I first heard about it on the radio, I didn\'t think that it was real. It sounded too unbelievable, as if it must be a sick April Fool\'s joke. The images and stories that followed were heartwrenching. I kept trying to imagine what it must have felt like to the people in the World Trade Center. For the ones that surrived, I think about their fear. For the ones that didn\'t survive, I wonder if they knew what was going on, and what their last thoughts were. Most of my information came from the radio rather than the television. I don\'t know if this made the event more or less real to me. In some ways I think that it made it more terrifying, since my imagination formed the pictures and images of what I heard. I would have to say that I feel more sad than angry. I just don\'t have much in me that wants revenge. In some ways I think I\'m more angry at the Americans who have been terrorizing Muslim-Americans and making them feel unsafe in their own country. Maybe this is simply because it seems more local and, therefore, real to me. I just feel like people who are assaulting Islamic people in the U.S. are distorting what it means to be an American.  I also feel like a very strange mood has swept the country since September 11. It seems like everywhere I look, I see signs saying  God Bless America,  flags tied to cars and being frayed in the wind, even dogs wearing flag collars. There just seems to me to be something shallow and artificial about some of this nouveau-patriotism. It\'s not that I don\'t love what this country stands for. Far from it. It\'s just that it seems like we have filled the pain and questions with  Product America.  Where were all these flag bearers before September 11? I\'m just afraid that patriotism, like so many other things, has become a commodity. \"\"Well, it looks as though groups funded by Osama bin Laden executed the attack. However, I don\'t know that this has been proven. \"I often think about sense of life and about future of my little son...\"It really schoked me!! When it was happened I was on holiday to Italy, and I hadn\'t any information about what is going on in my country and in hole world.  When my friend had showed me SMS from Poland, about events in NY, I thought, that it was a joke!! But it wosn\'t...  It was unbelievable and terrific for me. How people could do such terrible things. I can\'t understand it. Especially if there are religious couses of this terror attacks.  I feel deep sympathy with all American people, who have lost sombody in this horrific tragedy. I have no words to say how much sorry I am about yours nattional tragedy...   (I\'m sorry about my not so good English)     \"Islams fundamentalistsI donn\'t know. Ben Laudan from afganastan and his people\"When I first heard about the events that took place on September 11, I really wasn\'t sure what to think. I do not know a lot about world issues and I just didn\'t understand how anyone could do what they did to our country. I was not angry first, but more sad and just disturbed. All day I was a little paranoid as to what would happen next. I didn\'t and I don\'t understand how anyone can take their life and kill thousands of innocent people. When I got back from some of my classes I turned the news back on to see if there was anymore information. This is when I saw people of other countries dancing and giving out candy in their streets, celebrating the events that took place on attack in America. This made me sick and very angry. Not only do I not understand how anyone can do what they did to America, but how can you celebrate about it as much as you hate our country? If America had done to another country what they did to us I can guarantee that I would not be celebrating. It makes me think that there are entire countries filled with people who have many psychological problems that would be seen as very unstable and  possibly crazy in our country. The one thing that I thought was neat about the events that occurred on September 11th was the fact that so many americans came together and helped one another out. As of right now I am not paying very much attention to what is happening. I wish people could just sit at a conference table and agree upon everything, but I know that is unfortunately not the way the world works. \"\"I was a little disturbed at first, but I am the same as always except now I get a little paranoid everytime I even think I hear a plane. I do not think I will be flying on a plane for a long time\"\"I honestly do not know. I really do not know much at all about world issues, but I know and believe that America is about the number one country and other countries hate us for this\"The terrorist groups of the certain Middle Eastern countries.They disagree with the lifestyles of Americans and are one of many countries with long held hatreds towards America. \"I have come to realize how such a small series of events can really change things.

I call it political karma for our crappy foreign policy that most of us were totally unaware of.I believe it is probably Osama Bin LadenI am more paranoid.\"I am still doing the things I have always done.  Therefore, I think my feelings and beliefs have changed more than my behaviors.  For instance, I appreciate my family more than ever.  \"\"I think they must angry with America.  We must have done something to them, whether it was morally correct on our part or not.\"\"The events of September 11, 2001 were completely shocking and horrifying to say the least.  In fact, it was so abstract from everyday life, I almost didn\'t believe my mother when she called to tell me about the event.  I remember it clearly because I was in my dorm room, studying before my 12:30 class.  When my mother told me, I didn\'t fully understand how serious and drastic the event actually was.  But when I told my roommate and she turned on the news, I was completely speechless as I saw the two airplanes fly into the World Trade Center buildings.  I think that actually seeing it happen made it real in my mind and I was suddenly very scared. I cried a few times.  When I saw a picture in the newspaper of a man who had jumped out of the building to escape being burned or crushed it just broke my heart.  But it really sunk in when the news played some of messages that the victims left for their loved ones.  The message I heard was from a woman calling to tell her husband that there was an explosion in the building and that she loved him very much.  I could hear the terror in her voice.  I believe those images will forever be imprinted in all of our minds when we think of the thousands of innocent people who died that day. Some of the stories are inspirational, however.  There are stories of people who escaped the falling buildings.  Also, the stories of heroes who sacrificed their own lives to save the victims of this tragic event.  I think it\'s the hope that comes from these stories that keeps us all going. It is very difficult for us all to understand why anyone would want to kill innocent people.  I do not see what can be solved by this act of hatred.  The people who have committed these malicious acts are obviously very angry and very confused individuals. I think we can only pray that the people who did this will come to the realization that what they have done is wrong. I am very upset that the event has led us to war.  Now, we are leading even more people to death.  I do not understand how violence can be the solution to ending violence.  It does not make since to me.  My prayers go out to all of the soldiers who must give up their lives to fight this war.  Even those soldiers who may not die in the war, my prayers go out to them because they will not be the same after participating in war.   Most of all, I think this event has changed me as an individual.  I try to stop and appreciate my family.  I always tell them that I love them everytime we part.  It has made me realize exactly how vulnerable we are, even as American citizens.  Finally, it has made me value every day that God has given me.  \"I don\'t think we have come up with enough information to answer that question completely. But I do think that Osama bin Laden may be responsible.\"Like so many people of the world, I am deeply saddened, to the core, by the incidents of last week and feel so strongly for the individuals who experienced personal loss. I am concerned about the negative effects of retaliatory action.  I have many questions about the history of the hatred that so many Arab nations have for the U.S.\"outwardly more expressive of protectionist feelings of those who might be persecuted based on religion or country of origina coalition of militant Arab groupsto hurt the U.S. economically and emotionally to bring into question the U.S. position in the Middle EastThey feel that they were wronged in some way.  Their conviction was strong enough that they were willing to die.bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"\"Perhaps the Talaban...I wouldn\'t be surprised if the Islamic people were against the U.S. After all, we are supporting Israel and the Islamic people probably see it as 2 Christian nations trying to rise against them.\"The future doesn\'t seem to mean 10 years from now...the future seems more like 10 minutes from now.

'Osama Bin Laden and the Al-queada \"I feel that a memeber of the military, I am more at risk than ever before to deploy or even have my installation attacked (i.e., the Twin Towers and Pentagon).  I do not think that any behaviors have changed, I still open my mail.  Unlike somepeople that I know who wear gloves.\"They attacked the United States because they do not like our countries beliefs and attitudes and our desire to elp others.\"The morning of September 11th, I was on my way to work when I heard over the radio that an airplane had just crashed into the Twin Towers.  I thought that it was a joke.  After going into the local convience store, I heard that the second tower had been hit.  I was in complete shock.  I got to work and my LT (I am a memmber if the US Army) told me that we had been attacked.  Our entire section was in  a close huddle around a small radio listening for the latest updates as they came.  Soldiers all around me were agry and upset, yelling that they were ready to go get whoever was responsible for this terrible act.  I called my husband on the telephone (also a soldier in the US Army), he was crying on the phone telling me that both of the Twin Towers had crumbled to the ground and that the pentagon had been hit.  He told me of the pain he was feeling as he watched it crumble to the ground and that he saw people jumping out of the building.  Needless to say my instalation was locked down and we all spoke of the event for days, weeks, and months after.  We continue to speak of it and our anger and desire to go over there and kick some butt.    \"\"It is hard, even still, to believe.  It is impossible for me to understand how anyone or any group could justify such an action.  To take the lives of any, but so many, innocent people who were merely going about their lives is beyond comprehension. My heart goes out to those injured, and those who have lost loved ones.  I am grateful to those firefighters, police and  ordinary  who tried to rescue others, even though I personally lost no one in the tragedy.  I am grateful to those on flight 93 who prevented further losses. At noon that day, I walked with a friend over the lunch hour.  It was sunny, bright and beautiful, and reminded me that, in spite of what happened, there is still beauty and good in the world.  I came home and night and held my 18 year old daughter in my lap.  It comforted both of us.  I called my 21 year old son who was maybe 5 miles away, just to let him know I was thinking of him and to reassure myself he was ok.  Irrational, but.... I hated the feeling of wanting revenge that welled up inside me.  I   was glad it was specific to the perpetrators, not generalized to an entire ethnic, cultural or religious group.  I fear there will be, as there has been, random violence against muslims or arabs or people who someone thinks may be.  That doesn\'t solve the problem and only perpetuates it. I think our lives will never be the same.  I don\'t think this is the end of it.  There will be more incidents, perhaps using different methods.  I don\'t want my children to live in fear.  I cannot imagine how people cope in countries where terrorist acts and atrocities occur regularly.  I may find out.   I am proud of our country\'s pulling together.  I am proud of my childrens\' responses.  They are thoughtful, not knee-jerk, not  chill .  I feel more connection to family and friends.  I feel more patriotic  (I was very much against the Vietnam war and have tended to be skeptical and a bit suspicious about our government ever since).  I did not vote for Bush, but feel this is the time to support our leadership (intelligently, not blindly) rather than look for every opportunity to criticize. I want to do something positive and helpful.  I started by donating money to the red cross.  I will look for other opportunities.\"\"It is hard to fathom.

My own sense of the world has never been that there was much sense of safety, and these events have only confirmed for me that we are all in the same position.  And I don\'t know how I can alter that reality, so I feel discouraged.\"I have tried to show more love to the people in my life.\"Good question.  The easy answer would be because they hate American wealth and power.  I suspect the real reason is somewhat more complicated and is dependent upon the perpetrator.  We\'d have to look at each of the individual culprits.  Why would anyone hijack a plane?  Why would they be willing to die to kill other people?  Why would, if indeed bin Laden is the planner and funder for the attacks, this very complicated attack be planned at all?  And what in the world could he hope to accomplish?  I have more questions than I do answers . . . . \"The ONLY name I\'ve heard through the vast amounts of media is Osama bin Laden.  I don\'t have any other information.....and I don\'t know what real evidence exists as it remains classified and not open to the public.  \"I don\'t even know if I have a perspective.   When I heard about the first plane hitting the tower, I thought it was probably about a little Cessna, a big wind, a small hole in a big building, maybe someone was severely injured, perhaps even killed.   As I learned more details, I could only watch the news reports with horror.  Hand covering my mouth, stomach in knots, knowing that the world as I\'d always known it had suddenly changed very dramatically. I continue to worry about how my daughter\'s life will be affected by these events.  Every day, the newspaper headlines warn us of impending disasters and wars and serve to incubate the anxieties of our country.  It\'s hard to even get a handle on the sheer amount of devastation.  I heard this morning that it\'s 16 acres of debris, over 6300 missing and presumed dead, hundreds more dead as a result of being on the aircrafts or in the Pentagon.   I find it difficult to maintain any sort of perspective at all related to these events.  If nothing else, it\'s certainly brought home how inter-related we, as humans on earth, are.  Everyone knows someone who was directly affected.  People are killed, buildings are devastated, whole businesses are gone, major airlines suffer huge losses, people stop flying, tourism suffers, people lose jobs, economy loses confidence.  I am awed at the colossal amount of collateral damage.  \"\"None.  I continue to be a bit depressed, a bit more intolerant of people getting ticked off over the trivial stuff, a bit more appreciative of my family....\"Osama Bin Laden and followers\"hatred, jealousy, ignorance, insanity\"\"Words cannot express my feelings.  Thankfully, I did not lose anyone in the disaster.  However, I am very concerned about those who did.  I try to imagine how they must feel.  It saddens me to think of the loss of so many wonderful people.  I often think about the terror the vitims on the planes must have felt.  I have been glued to the tv since the attack, but must admit that as days pass, my initial curiosity is replaced with fear.  I experienced nightmares on Sunday after the tragedy.  Afterwards, I made the decision not to watch as much television.  I work in psychiatry, and wonder how many will develop PTSD.  I am moved by the many stories I have seen on tv, and moved by the reactions of people who have seemed so strong, so emotion-free.  For instance, I watched David Letterman last night.  Dan Rather was his first guest and he became tearful on two occasions.  The other story that stands out in my mind is the one of the CEO of Canter Fitzgerald.  Finally, I am shocked by the hatred that these terrorists feel for the U.S. We must do something to put an end to terrorism.

But, I feel as though if we don\'t go over there an do something, they will just continue to torment us on our soil.  I think that this was a way for God to rid the world of evil.  He did it in the Bible and took innocent lives to do it.  In this day and age, I think it was an event that should have been somewhat avoided.  We have so many people and so much technology, that the terrorist should have never been able to pull this off.  I realize that hind sight is 20/20 but looking back over all the evidence prior to the attacks, they could have and should have been stopped.  My husband and I have taken alot of time to put together a very indepth scrapbook of all the pictures, headlines, articles, emails and anything else related to the attacks.  My husband, children and myself have been to several candlelighting, rallies and events relating to the attacks.  We are also Red Cross Volunteers.  We have donated time and money to the victims and families of the attacks.  We support the governmental decisions that have already been made and will continue to do so.  We are very PROUD AMERICANS and will do what ever we feel is necessary to help our country and our fellow Americans to get through this tragedy.  \"\"i don\'t think i have a right to point fingers. i do not have all the facts, only the biased ones given in the  news and in the press.\"\"while i am angry at the insane act, i am far more saddened for losses suffered by the families that have lost someone.  It is had enough to  lose a friend or family member, but to not have the closure of an actual funeral is hard to fathom.  I suffered a miscarriage the week this happened and i felt guilty for needed to grieve, when i could go home to my husband and my first born child.  my heart goes out to those people who lost someone near and dear and now to the future, i pray for my friends and family in the military who will be called upon to battle the evil that caused this tragedy.\"\"i think it is politically motivated and a plain and simple hate crime against the US.

I am more observant.

When I am now in a high rise, or looking at the John Hancock while a plane flies by or I hear sirens...I respond.  In the past I wouldn\'t have noticed. I did not respond with anger or revenge. I believe we have sent our own negativity out into the world in many respects and it is being karmicly returned...more severely than any of us could have ever imagined. I am very aware of the heroes and their families response.  They are sad, but peaceful.  They don\' necessarily purport revenge or retaliation. I am concerned for children...the psychological impact...that they will never truly be safe in the ways they have known before.  Nor will any of us be. While I do not feel unsafe...I am cautious and am getting to a point that I can accept death if it should come.  To me, the people who died that were the most fortunate were the ones killed instantly, not knowing anything and those that jumped.  For me,  flying  seemed preferable to burning or being crushed.  And a Zen concept came to mind... If you jump from the sky, do you truly hit the ground?  My greatest fear is for those who feel the need for violent revenge.  I would like to sleep normally...at times I am exhausted and can sleep for 2 hours in the middle of the day.  I am sick of talking about it or seeing the crash footage.  I take hope in those who are dealing with the tragedy firsthand. Despite some of my reactions, I feel centered and far more peaceful than I would have thought.  All I can do is live in the moment and try to rid myself of fears when they occur.\"\"1st, how shocking, 2nd why, what for, who did this. Initial reaction was also mixed with feelings of dismay and thoughts for the people trapped and killed, dead or dying still contained within the towers. Media representation coverage from US had the tinge of who did this, we\'re going to get them, how dare anyone do this to US. After one or two days of continual coverage from mass media, stopped watching the news, the scenes were the same the message the same, we\'ll get them back. Unfortunately the commercial stations were focused on this, the more left wing tv and radio stations looked at the reasons why this happened, the social issues for the oppressed countries and the hatred and disempowerment they must feel for US to even think of such an attack, in their wildest dreams, who would go to such lengths to symbolically damage such a seemingly friendly, country. Who would do such a thing, who indeed. People who are not prepared to be squeezed any longer. Seems that some people fight back for what they feel is not right. I don\'t know enough about US politics or gov\'t to even delve into the why but this is a social issue that must be addressed, by the US people.\"Uncomfortable with being squeezed for everSome one fed up with being squeezedMy behaviour is unaffected.',4,-5,0,2,5,1.58,3.17,0,0,1.58,0,0,2.38,3.17,0,2.38,0,15.84,0,0,0,0,0,1.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.12,3.17,0,3.17,1.58,1.58,0,0,3.17,0,0,0,1.58,0,0,0,0,47.49,0,1.58,0,0,0,1.58,1.58,0,55.41,4.75,0,1.58,0,0,0,2.38,0,4.74,0,0,0,0,0,23.74,7.92,0,0.79,1.58,0,11.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.38,0,0,0,Female49bb
'i have never been so scared in my life.  Several terrorist groups not limited to but including al queda.To display their disgust for the values and lifestyle of the American people\"At first, I was afraid to leave my house.  As of Thursday, I have had no real changes in my life. \"Islamic radicals\"After the September 11th attack, I felt personally effected.  I did not know anyone who was directly effected, although I felt a sense of anger, resentment, and pain.  I watched television for 12 strait hours that day, until I couldn\'t watch it anymore.  And in the weeks to come, I was sullen, I didn\'t feel like doing anything, and it was extremely hard to try and understand.  The only good thing I feel like this brought about, was how our country has responded.  Everyone has pulled together to do anything they can to help.  Our generation will never be the same.  And I personally have never felt so patriotic in my entire life.  \"\"They are confused about what a holy war is, and what God wants them to do to fight this holy war.\"\"I am just more aware of what is going on in the world, and in my own community.  And I am thankful for everyday I am alive.\"I think I am more aware of my surroundings and other people around me.  I pay closer attention to what people are saying around me.  I feel like I should be  on guard at times depending on the situation.\"I probably will never forget this day as long as I live.  It was my day off and I had just turned CNN off after watching the news.  My 2 children were in school (ages 7 and 5).  My husband was at work. Then the phone rang and it was my 73 yr old mother asking me if I had the TV on.  I said no I had just turned it off so I could get some  housework done.  I asked what was going on and my mother said a plane had just hit the WTC in New York.  I clicked on the TV and there it was, smoke everywhere, CNN was running live coverage and then within a short period of time I saw (as the entire world did) the second plane hit the second tower.  I could not beleive my eyes!  My God! I said to my mother.  We were still on the phone and we both said   I\'m going to hang up.   I stood in the middle of my living room in numbness, I think I even stopped breathing for a few seconds.  I could not believe my eyes.  I thought I was dreaming.  Then the other reports of the plane hitting the Pentagon and the plane in Penn. crashing.  I got down on my knees and started to pray.  I thought this was the end of the world.  I cried, no I sobbed. I was scared to  death.  Then I called my husband and he didn\'t seem too concerned at the time, but all he had to listen to was the radio.  He couldn\'t actually see the events unfold like I did.  I thought of going to get the kids out of school.  A million thoughts went through my mind. I think now I was in a panic state, just as I\'m sure the people in NY were only they had no clue as to what or why or who.  I stayed glued to the TV the rest of the day.  I could not do anything else but to watch and wait and see what would or was going to happen next.  I called my husband back 2 more times that day and he told me to calm down when I suggested to taking the kids out of school.  Then I received a phone call from work (I am a nurse in a hospital) and they wanted me to work that evening 7pm to 7am.  I said ,  I can\'t .  Too much has happened today. I am totally drained.  They understood and nothing else was said.        I then started to think about a couple of physicians I work with who are from Jordan and Syria.  Both excellent MD\'s.  One of them though was out of the country and had departed about a week before the attack.  We wondered if he would have a problem getting back into the USA, but he returned on the 16th or 17th and nothing seemed different except he said everytime someone got up in the plane to use the restroom everyone on the entire plane would turn their heads to see what they were doing.  He said it was a tense flight.       Since his return some rumors have been going around the hospital that an orderly asked him what he thought about the attack and supposedly his reply was  The Americans got just what they deserved.   At that the orderly punched the MD out and the FBI was called and this MD (whom I have worked with for almost 5 yrs.) was questioned by them.  I know they (the MD\'s) have both made antiAmerican comments, but most of it is related to our morals and lack of religious dedication.  In a way they are right, but then again sometimes you have to keep comments to yourself, especially in a time like this.  I have a great respect for these two physicians. I  have always tried to have an open mind about different faiths, or different cultures.  Prior to this attack I had been reading up on the Islamic faith and the muslim way of life.  I thought it would help me understand my coworkers better and help me understand why they speak the way they do and why they behave the way they do.  I don\'t ask them any personal questions because they are vague in their conversation.  They never seem to want to reveal too much information about themselves.  Which I can respect them for.  I like my privacy too.  But on the other hand they are interested in everything you are doing or want to know what is going on around the hospital.  I guess I mean to say I am a little more careful in choosing what I say to both of them now.  I still respect them both for their abilities as physicians but I think I also have a tiny bit of fear or an  on guard  feeling about them now.  Especially the one that does alot of traveling back and forth to the Middle East due to his wife and children remaining in their homeland.  I think in time though as we all work through this terrible tragedy our fears will decrease to a certain extent and we can get back to our  normal  activities.        I have noticed how strangers everywhere are much more friendly and caring.  Whether it be in the mall, the grocery.  It seems like we are all consoling each other eventhough we are not directly touched (did not have a family member in the WTC) but yet we all are touched very deeply.  I have never had a feeling like this before it is difficult to describe.  The sense of unity as a nation, a community, no matter how small.  This  togetherness , concern for each other, the spiritual closeness at church is very strong. You can feel it in the air at church.  I guess it reaches to my very soul. I have always prayed since I was a child, but I think I have prayed more and more intensely since September 11.  The meaning of the words  have more understanding and strength.  I feel prayer is a very important aspect in our lives that should not be forgotten or left undone.  We must be sincere in what we are saying.  This is how I have been changed.  I know I have the strength within me to pass this strength onto my children, for that is what keeps us united as a nation, a family, a person, as one united in God and nation we can conquer any evil on this earth.  The spirit of America will live on long after we have gone to be with our Lord, our God, our heavenly Father.  NO ONE, no matter how hard they try, can ever take that away. \"I don\'t really know.  Obviously someone who hates the US very much.  I knew some groups did not like the US but I never thought something like this would ever happen.  Something so evil.Pure hatred.  Maybe they have a psychological problem.Hatred for the USA terrorist network that is sophisticated and well-prepared.\"I attached a record of my experience to an email a few minutes ago.  That is more complete than what I might write here.  I feel vulnerable and frightened, praying for a peace that lifts us above becoming impulsive and vengeful.  The Dalai Lama wrote about the experience (I can send you the letter if you  have not seen it) and this capsulizes very well what I am feeling. I beseech our leaders to find a peaceful solution with no more loss of innocent lives, and no more pain as this has caused.

It was hard to believe that an attack on such a grand scale could occur in the US.  However, upon reflection, the US had much indication that groups were threatening its interests.  I believe what has happened in the  US is a terrible thing, but an equally terrible thing is the  frightening nationalistic response that has occurred in this country. The harassment and violence against people of Arab or Muslim descent has been sickening.  For years, they will be subject to prejudice and discrimination (more than they had in the past) merely based on their skin color or religion.   I am truly frightened about our response in Afghanistan, and have  been very pleased with how slowly the government is proceeding.  I am scared about retaliation against our country.  There is no way to prevent attacks in different forms from occurring here in the  future, and attacking Afghanistan will only fuel the fire.   I am NOT saying that I agree with what the responsible group did in NY and DC, but I understand anger at the US.  Although I love this country and would want to live nowhere else, we do much to anger  other groups by picking and choosing who we will give economic and military support to based on economic reasons.  We get involved in many conflicts that we do not understand merely because it suits our best economic interests.

'Bin Laden and his regime\"I have become more conscience of those around me, I am afraid of airplanes.  I am just on edge wondering what is going to happen next.\"because they are mentally ill and dilusional\"I feel that these attacks were unneccessary, in that they could have been stopped.  Airport security could have noticed things that the hijackers had and the behavior that they were exhibiting.  Thousands of lives were taken unfairly and I think that the nation should find a way to stop terrorism.\"\"I think Ozama Bin Laden, his followers, and the people who are protecting him are responsible.

I feel such a big sadness for all the people who died and their families.  I want to tell them that i know how they feel because for a couple of hours i didn\'t know where my brother was.  Thanks to GOD he was in good health.  My life and the lives of all of us are never going to be the same.  Even though this country is never going to be the same because we are always going to have the fear of another attack, we are going to come together and the country is going to be more unite than ever before.

I have this fear that someone\'s going to creep up on me when I\'m in the dark and do something (I don\'t even know what) to me, so I try to avoid being in the dark as much as possible, even though I know my fears are unfounded. I am, at times, paralyzed by my fear and sadness.\"\"The U.S. has vested interests in the Middle East because of its petroleum wealth. We have made friends there, and we have made enemies. I\'m not excusing what these terrorists have done in the least, but I will not say that the U.S. is completely innocent, either.\"Osama bin Laden\"The following is an excerpt from a journal entry I wrote on 14 September: I wrote this incredibly long journal entry yesterday that I ended up not posting. It was wrought with emotion and sadness and distress and fear, and in all honesty, when I read over what I had written, I became afraid all over again. I do not need this right now. I do not need this fear that grips me in broad daylight, this fear that paralyzes me at night and makes me inexplicably afraid of the dark. And yet it is here. And I am afraid. And that is all. I talked to my psychiatrist about this last night (you may recall that I have a psychiatrist, because of my depression and my AD/HD), and he says that what I refer to as my  unreasonable  fears are manifesting themselves because of my more realistic human fears, like my fear of being left alone. I suppose that is true. I myself am not that afraid of death. But this past week, whenever I\'ve seen my mother leave the house, I am gripped with this fear of,  What if I never see her again? What if something happens to her?  And the same goes for when my fiance leaves my house to go back to his. At this point in my life, I don\'t think I could bear to live without my fiance and my mother. In my head, I know that these are high irrational fears, but part of me nags,  Hey, I bet those thousands of people who died this Thursday thought they would go home and see their loved ones at the end of the day, too.  I can rationalize both fear and hope. And right now, fear seems to be the more logical choice. I hate that. I hate what this week has done to me. And what I fear perhaps most of all is that I will move on, that I will get better . . . but then the U.S. will strike, then the enemy will strike back . . . and then this whole wave of terror will strike within me again. . . . And yet, I am beginning to heal . . . \"\"When I first heard about the event, I was in German class.  I had mixed emotions.  I was feeling a little scared.  I also felt a lot of anger.  One of my sisters lives in Washington D.C. so I was worried about her.

Unless the USA is embarrassed by the very MONSTER that it created in Osama Bin Ladin. He is EVIL, personified.

It was the first time that I wanted to be back so badly.  \"\"I can\'t point out who is responsible for the Sep 11 attack. US government points out Bin Laden is the leader, but he is not only who is responsible. The hijackers themselve are also responsible and US is also responsible in a way since they have educated the hijackers.\"\"I don\'t understand how the hijackers felt at the moment of the attack. From the news, I heard that they were taught that  America is evil and the act will lead them to a better life . I can\'t understand why death will lead them to a better life. The hijackers had their own families and why didn\'t they think about their own family? Why did they have to choose death? In Japan, there were also suicidal attacks against US during the WW II. I have read the autobiography of the Kamikaze soldieres. They have all stated that they didn\'t want to die even though they said they will die for the sake of the country in front of other people. However, the psychological state of the hijackers\' seemed different from these Kamikaze soldiers. They not only killed themselves but took away lives of many other people. I don\'t understand how they can sacrifice the lives of other people. If they hated Americans, why did they attack the Twin Tower? People other than Americans worked in that building. I try to understand what the Taliban is thinking but I have not come to that state. I only understand that the enviroment surrouding them made the hijackers as they are. \"\"They have been brainwashed. The hijackers life must have been miserable when they were a child and in their mind a wrong idea has prevailed. If they were taught that America is evil, they think that is true since that is the only truth they know about. \"\"I\'m afraid.  I know all of America is right now, but what I don\'t get is why everyone seems so set for revenge, because it\'s the revenge that I\'m afraid of.  It\'s war that I\'m afraid of.  Doesn\'t everyone see that by responding with war that this is only the beginning of the death and destruction? What will the difference be between those deaths and these? I\'m not an American, but as a Canadian all of this is affecting me just as much, and there will be a war in my backyard too.  I don\'t want to see that happen.  War will not solve anything.

I have never been on a plane, and now I  don\'t think I\'ll ever fly. To think that people can just hop on and hijack a plane is the scariest thing I\'ve ever felt. I thought things like that only happened in the movies. Our country is at war now over something that could have been avoided with better security. We also have to worry now about hate crime escalating toward Arab Americans.

I think that it was cowardly, and was an extreemly vulger display of power(power that doesn\'t exist).\"bin Laden\'s groupSticking closer to home; spending less $; more bad dreams\"It was a reality check for me.  I never gave national security a second thought, but now I think about it every day.  The initial media coverage was really great, but now the news stories conflict and you don\'t always hear the conclusion to a breaking story.  For instance, it appears there were things being planned or set-up on more levels than just airline hijacking.  And you may hear that someone was detained or arrested for something but you never hear the outcome of their questioning.  I have an overall unsettled feeling, similar to what I might feel like if I knew I had a terminal but slow progressing disease.  There is no point in having a rule if it is not adequate and/or enforced, and I feel the FAA let us all down, big time.  I am scared to fly now.  I feel like I need to prepare for other forms of terrorist attacks, but when I think about how to do that, everything I come up with sounds futile and I cannot envision really living that way.  The government needs to do something meaningful soon or people\'s confidence in our leaders will wane.  If that happens, I think it will have a very bad effect on the economy and that domestic (in the U.S.) violence will increase.  This may be a new kind of war but we need some of the old kind of reassurances as well as new techniques to really make us feel like we are safe and in control.  It was really nice to see the politicians work together and the country unite.  We rose to the occasion -- but what is it? \"They resent our interference in the middle east.  This was a way they could strike back at us.For political and financial gain. I refuse to believe they did it only for religious reasons. I think bin Laden  and his ilk are power-hungry egomaniacs.\"Working in NYC, I felt I had to do a few things to make myself feel better: I organized and clearly listed my personal assets and updated my will; I no longer ride in the first subway car(as I always did); I look at people on the train now; I bought some bottled water and  power bars  to keep on hand; I upped the amount of  emergency  cash I keep on hand; I keep my car gas tank full; I try to work out more often to reduce anxiety.\"\"Islamic terrorist groups, not necessarily al Qaeda alone.\"\"I work in Soho, NYC, which is about a mile and 1/2 from  ground zero  (a phrase I dislike by the way).  I find that I simply cannot grasp that there are 4000 bodies still buried so close to where I am.  I think it might be a defense mechanism on my part that allows me to come to work every day. I am honestly not very afraid of anything happening to me, even with the anthrax scares, and I\'m not afraid to ride on the subway. I think that a lot of my anxiety has lessened.  I was very tense for the first few weeks afterward, and have lost about 10 lbs since 9/11.  Talking about it with friends and family, and knowing that nobody close to me was hurt or  otherwise affected, helps.  Coming to work every day and seeing throngs of people in the city also helps.  The thing that I felt most strongly about  the attacks was not that America had been attacked, but that NEW YORK, my hometown and my people, had been attacked.  I was extremely angry for a  while, but now I am more concerned about the  war  and how it might further complicate matters rather than improve things.  I am also finding it very hard to have to listen to the news several times a day, something I only did in the morning prior to 9/11.  I\'m not drowning myself in information, but I feel like I have to stay informed.   Finally, as a lifelong Mets fan, I\'m finding it awfully difficult to root for the hated Yankees, but I guess it\'s the thing to do.... seeing the joyous, sold-out Yankee Stadium on TV is really quite heartening, even if it is only Yankee fans! :o)\"\"The news depresses me, and I have a hard time walking away from the stories.  I saw a short period of respect and patience in people around me, but as time passes, that heightened sense of deliberate behavior has faded.\"i\'ll never know\"bin laden and his network of fear, hate and jealousy\"\"I don\'t think that the world that we have enjoyed up until 9/11/01 will ever be the same.  I think of all the lives that were affected, and all of the pain that was inflicted on that day by this senseless act of terror, and I cannot understand why or how it happened.  I realize how lucky I am to not have close friends or even acquaintences who were hurt by the attack, but selfishly, I hate it that I can\'t live my daily life or plan a trip overseas without this event coming into my decision making process. I feel more pride in our Armed Forces since September 11, and I feel, as I always have, but to a greater degree,  Proud to be an American.   I hate that our world cannot co-exist in peace, but I hope that in time, we will all have harmony.\"Nonea response to US control being exerted internationally for its own interest \"this should be decided by investigations undertaken by various international agencies with power and responsibility to do this, and put through recognised legal systems, with evidence is considered thoroughly and a jury considers who is guilty of the crime and decides if a person/s is guilty.

I have sympathy for those innocent people who have lost their lives in this tragedy. I do however feel that the US has interfered and manipulated countries for a long time and usually for their own self-interest, so it is not surprising that this type of covert attack has occurred. I am also concerned that much of the western world reaction has an underlying  some are more equal than others  sentiment to it. ie lives lost in the US are more worthy of being mourned than lives lost in developing countries or those who practice another faith.\"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,1.66,0,0,0,1.66,0,1.66,1.66,0,1.66,0,8.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.66,1.66,0,0,3.31,3.31,0,0,4.98,0,0,0,1.66,0,0,1.66,0,38.12,0,1.66,0,0,0,0,3.31,0,49.73,4.97,0,6.62,0,1.66,0,0,0,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,18.23,11.61,0,0,0,0,9.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.31,Female49bb
'Islam terrorists\"Because i don\'t listen to radio or TV during the day, I found out about the attacks from my neighbor. My first reaction was great fear. I asked,  What do we do now?  as I put my arms up to cover my head. And I answered myself,  I know. We bend over and kiss our ass goodbye.  I felt a throw back to the fears of the cold war, when we knew that an Russian atomic or hydrogen bomb would kill us; no place to run, no place to hide.  Then the fear numbed me. I began watching the events on TV and was horrified and couldn\'t really accept that what had happened was real. Like many people, it felt as if I were watching a movie. Later in the day, seeking some semblance of normalcy, I went to my weaving class. But after about a half-hour, I had to stop; I couldn\'t concentrate or focus on what I was doing. When I left I intended to go home and meditate. But I drove around and found myself at a Wal-Mart store, where I seldom shop. In a complete mental haze (yet functioning and comprehending) I went into the optometrist and had an eye exam and ordered a pair of glasses. I did need both the exam and the new glasses. When I returned home I realized that I was grieving and allowed that feeling to express itself in occassional crying and great feelings of sadness. For the next few days I wore a black armband. I watched less and less TV about the attacks. Gradually over a few days, my sadness abated. No one I know was hurt in the attacks, and living in CA I feel far removed from the event. I was concerned with the nationalism exhibited by all the flag flying, but I did put small US and UN flags in the rear window of my car. Now that the  war  has started, I\'m just waiting, without anxiety, to see what happens next. I practice Buddhism which helps me retain calm yet alert.\"I listen to less news and avoid all talking heads giving their opinions and best guesses of what\'s happening and will happen and why.Their irrational fears and crazy thinking leads them to hate some entity enough to destroy it even as they destroy themselves.\"Because of poor communications and underhanded deals from country to country, that is out of the control of American citizens.\"\"Initially I was shocked, outraged and down right angry.  Being a student at Park University I was in class when the news brought the information about the first plane and we continued to watch while both towers collapsed.  While listening to the information about the Pentagon.  All of a sudden there was a division on campus that is hard to describe.  All of the foreign students were identifyable all of a sudden in a way that never mattered.  People seemed to be careful what they said to each other and the feelings grew as we exhaled from the initial shock.  All international students became targets for much of the bad feelings brought on by Sept 11th if whether they were born within the United States or not.  Being Afro American I have felt some of these feelings, but it was clear that this feeling was new for some of these students.  Some discontinued thier studies and others are riding the wave hoping hthings will settle down soon.  But all of the students were devastated national and international students and grieved together for the senseless lost of lives on Sept 11th.\"The United States.My behavior has changed as far as my understanding of some of our international students and our custom procedures.Because they are convinced it is right in the name of a God and a religion. Brain-washing. I do not believe the people who did it are crazy.Ben Laden has something to do with it. But maybe US econimics and politics led to the situation that created these kamikaze-murderer.\"On Sept. 11, I listened to the radio to get the news. I was shaken up. I thought it was horrible. I could not believe it. I had a lot of work to do on that day but it was very difficult to concentrate. It felt like it was disrespectful to the victims to do my usual everyday work, like nothing had happened. Since then, I can\'t avoid listening carefully to airplanes when they fly over Montreal where I live. Last night (September 28), I had a nightmare about terrorist attacks. The first one since Sept. 11 (the first one I remember at least). There were special airplanes, almost invisible. The terrorists were aliens (extra-terrestrians). We could not communicate with them. In my dream, there was also a terrorist attack with a boat crashing in a other one. Then there was a flood (I often dream of floods when I am under stress).\"I do not feel as safe as before. I worry more about future.\"On an actionable, material level - the terrorists who perpetrated the attacks.  Probably linked to Osama bin Laden. On an energetic, human interaction, and consciousness level - we all are.  We have created the dynamic of duality.  We are responsible for transcending it.\"\"The tragic events of September 11th, 2001 signal to me a bifurcation point in our collective conscious evolution.  A marked point when the steady periodic rhythm of life is interrupted.  At this juncture, we will get a rare glimpse into the \'consciousness-psyche\' of an immense culture.  We, especially our brothers and sisters in the US, have been outrageously jolted into an awareness of our vulnerable position in relation to forces we don\'t fully understand.   It is this lack of understanding that allows us to maintain our illusion of separateness.  Like it or not (how obvious must it get?, we are living cheek to jowl, energetically engaged in a dance of cultural creation with the rest of the world.  The quality of the reality which we will dance into being, through our dynamic movements together, is the juciest point of enquiry.  Will we find a way which is both just and compassionate?  Will we find a new way to be together at all?  Will we gravitate back into complacency?  The REAL question here is - how much more do we need to suffer before we get the message? I am heartened by the diversity I have played in, on the Internet.  I can feel myself intellectually and spiritually open when I allow being \'taken in\' by the storied perspectives of multiple points of contact.   As I explore these, my own perspective becomes clearer, calmer, and with (paradoxically) both sharper and lessened defense mechanisms at the ready.  At some level, I believe we all play a co-creative role in choosing which \'strange attractor\' we graviate to.  For me, the following beliefs are helpful:  Firstly, the principles and one law of open space must be considered -  - whoever comes are the right people,  - whenever it starts is the right time,  - whatever happens is the only thing that could have, and  - when it\'s over - it\'s over. - The Law of Mobility - if you are neither learning nor contributing to a conversation, move to somewhere else. Secondly, the principle of story circles.   - share, whenever possible, in an unobstructed circle and in a manner which honours that each person\'s perspective (story) is encoded with a truth or wisdom from them, just for you.  Listen for it.   - also, tell your own stories (thoughts, feelings, and beliefs) with that in mind. What is your wisdom gift?  Focusing on people\'s stories teaches us that we, and our stories, are not mutually exclusive propositions.  A story is a perspective - there are many.  When we come from a place where there is only one \'right\' story, we are overly defended and unable to take in essential evolutionary information from our environment.  We live in a world of complex relationships and multiple reality.   - seeing things from a storied perspective is to evolutionary psychology what virtual reality is to the future of cyberspace.  Leap to a new consciousness!  With this comes the responsibility and the blessing of choice.  Using it wisely figures prominently in whether we will continue to retain the privelege. In these ways, 9.11 has pushed me to engage in co-creating my own consciousness.  I, and we, are invited to self-organize with conscious intent. When asked how a person might truly save the world, Grandmother Tywla (a Native American wisewoman) replied, \'Save yourself.\'  I am aware that what I choose to mainfiest impacts the entire field.  Knowing this, I feel even more strongly called to add my voice, my gift, my foibles and humanity. Good question.  Thanks for the opportunity to tell a story - from my perspective. Sincerely, Glory Ressler\"\"When the human spirit is crouched by sustained, particularly transgenerational, conflict and fear it reacts in startingly ways.

My initial reaction was one of anger, having served in the medical unit of the Women\'s Army Corp. during the Vietnam Era.  Mental recall of those wounded, disfigured and, otherwise, traumatized by the physical and mental devastation imposed by war caused me great spiritual distress before I even saw the pictures on television broadcasts.

To steal a plane and turn it into a bomb, killing thousands of innocent people, is just simply unthinkable. I am 100\% in agreement with our President and he is handling this very well...I think we should flush them out of hiding, attach every dime of money they have to pay for clean up and the victims families, and torture and kill every one of them... I do not believe that we should even take them to trial.   The taliban and Bin Laden need to be anniolated and done with once and for all. We also need to return all the STUDENTS here on visas from their country...why are we educating people that can then return and sneak in non citizens to help with attacks of this nature.

My behaviours have not changed\"When I heard about the attacks I turned on the TV to see if there was any more details.  I then saw all the footage of the the planes crashing.  I just could not believe what I was seeing.  I think it was almost like shock.  It was just like watching a movie or something similar.  I guess you just get desensitised to violence through the complete over exposure in the media, that you can\'t believe that this happens in real life.  It was completely shocking to see the footage - to see the actual victims rather than just hear about them. When I first saw the footage it was almost like the world was ending or something - how could this happen? It is a shock to realise that you are not as (relatively)safe and secure in the world as you just assume. But I am strongly against creating a war to get revenge.  That would just be playing straight into the terrorists hands.  I do believe that the people responsible should be held accountable - but all that war does is hurt the innocent.  How can you justify war as a response - you killed innocent people so to show you how wrong you are we will do the same??. I think the imbalance of power and wealth in the world needs to be addressed. It is scary to think how filled the world is with hate and greed.  And lashing out in anger is only going to compound this.  I don\'t think the actions of a few should be allowed to throw the world into turmoil.  But having said this the people responsible should be brought to justice, I just want it to be done correctly, I don\'t think yet another bloodbath is the answer. The whole event has been terribly sad - I still can\'t quite believe that it happened.  My heart goes out to the victims families.

'I sleep more.  \"This is a continuation of what I wrote a couple of days ago.   When it looked like GW might get elected, I got the first an uneasy feeling in my stomach because I suspected there would be a war.  It occured to me that he would be following in his father\'s footsteps and wanted to stir up another storm in the desert.  And sure enough, once elected, the middle east problems worsened.  But he refused to get involved and stood by doing nothing.  At that point I felt even more uneasy.   I thought that he was (if not consciously, then subconsciously) hoping for the situation to erupt in a way that he could glean the impetus to go back and finish what his daddy started.  To me it seemed obvious that  ignoring  Sharon and Arafat would result in disaster.  Yet that\'s exactly what he did.  And the pot boiled over. And he declared a war on the evil terrorists.  How embarassing for the president to call a continent of hopeless and destitute, suicidally depressed people  evil  and declare a war on them.   When I was a kid, if somebody insulted me, I always said  It takes one to know one.   If I could see what was coming, why couldn\'t the president of the USA?  And if he couldn\'t, then how come he\'s the president and I\'m not?  When I said that it wouldn\'t surprise me to find out that GW set it up, I misspoke.  What I meant was: It seems obvious to me that he chose a course of action that would orchestrate war.

Willpower which is either for the god or for the bad, here the influence of superiors (adults, politician, religion groups) plays a major role. Watching TV I am frightened to see young people (kids and here esp. males) who show a great aggressiveness (i.e. Reports from Palestine, Israel). Not to forget the many horror films etc.  which do not give a good example to the youth. Many films/movies should become forbidden at all. Here we should i.e. also not forget the many murdering attacks by students at US schools lately. Kids don\'t seem to be able to understand what\'s right and what\'s wrong.

My first association was  the War of the Worlds , the radioplay of Orson Welss: everybody thought it was true while it was just a play. Was this some sick joke too?  The Dutch reporter was very shocked and they were trying to make out whether it was an accident or an attack. When the second tower was hit, it was clear it was no accident. I had to keep myself from crying, thinking about the panique of all those people, their families and the people who must have been in that plane and knew they were going to die.

Now, about two weeks later, I still feel shocked but also shocked about what is happening to the world and to the relation between Moslims and non-Moslims. I hate to hear that people attack innocent moslims, that there might be a war in which innocent people are going to get killed or hurt in another way. You start to ask yourself questions such as, where do we have the United Nations for, why is it also a war against the Taliban in Afghanistan? Of course it is a horrible fascist regime, but is this America\'s new Vietnam? In other words, my thinking starts to become more political. Of course the number of people that were hurt is horrible, but there are 5000 people dying everday because of hunger. We don\'t fight a war about that. I don\'t know, I am not American, maybe I would have wanted revenge if I was American. I think in this case, showing your teeth and muscles is not the solution.\"Out of despair and insanityno changes',3,-5,0,2,5,4.17,4.17,0,0,2.78,0,1.39,0,1.39,0,1.39,0,4.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.39,0,0,0,1.39,1.39,0,0,9.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.78,0,40.31,0,2.78,0,0,0,0,1.39,0,47.95,2.78,0,4.17,0,0,0,0,0,4.17,0,0,0,0,0,9.73,7.64,5.56,0,0,0,5.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.78,2.08,Female49bb
'00we need revenge0\"My behaviors changed on september, 73 when the US ordered the attack to the chilean goverment of Salvador Allende.\"\"I will right in sapanish.  Pienso que el ataque, si bien es absolutamente condenable, se puede entender bajo la logica de la dominacion que ha ejercido Estados Unidos desde tiempos remotos con un estilo de imposicion de politicas economicas y politicas que solo les convienen a ellos. Creo que es terrible la cantidad de muertos, las familias que quedan desoladas, eso no tiene explicacion ni precio. Creo que los Estados Unidos y en general el mundo occidental debe reflexionar ante estos  hechos, sin que por ello se sientan que estan siendo debiles, al contrario. \"United States of American and the ideology of capitalism \"because of angry and revange, and for the unjustice in this world. \"I guess it\'s Osama Bin Laden and his group of terrorists.\"I am trying to prepare in small ways to protect myself and my family from possible effects of acts of aggression, for example, I\'m  stockpiling  water and food that could be used if necessary.\"\"The US must represent everything that they think is evil, or maybe it\'s a case of the have-nots hating the haves and acting on that hatred.\"\"    From the first moments after the events became known, it was apparent that they would change the world. I was in the company of my co-workers, ages 18 through 57, and was surprised that the younger people, ages 18, 20, and 27, at first didn\'t see the overall significance of the events, though they recognized the events themselves as  big news.       Everything happened so fast on Sept. 11, it was hard to comprehend it all. It\'s still hard to comprehend it all. I kept waiting for someone to say the news reports were false, that these things - or even just some of these things - hadn\'t really happened. Years ago my father told me that he had seen the plane that crashed into the Empire State Building, in the 1940\'s, and I kept trying to twist the news on Sept. 11 so I could believe that these were small planes that had hit the Twin Towers by accident. It seemed paranoid to be calling the plane crashes  acts of terrorism.  And if  they  knew so soon after the actual events took place that they were indeed acts of terrorism, then why didn\'t they know just a little sooner and then be able to stop them from happeneing in the first place?    So disbelief, shock, incredulousness, helplessness, horror, grief - these were the main emotions of the day, and the days to follow. It was all so heart-wrenchingly unbelievable - how could this enormous tragedy have happened to us?     This is without a doubt the biggest news event of my life, surpassing even the assasination of President Kennedy. I don\'t think we\'re anywhere near done experiencing the fallout from these events, emotionally or otherwise. Everyone alive at the time of the attacks will be affected by them in one way or other for the rest of their lives.\"\"Out of anger, injustice, oppression, economic disparity... there are many factors contributing.\"\"I have stayed home a lot. I have reached out to family and friends more frequently, and I have watched a lot more TV and listened to NPR more than usual.\"\"Bin Laden, probably along with other groups and possibly governments \"\"I am afraid of the war and violence that I believe are likely outcomes of this. I believe very, very deeply that to answer violence with violence begets more violence. Violence robs us of our most basic human ability to recognize the humanity of another. There must, surely, be other roads to stability and security. Even if peace is uneasy and constantly under negotiation, it is better than war.  However, I do not kid myself that once the US war machine is cranked up that a few peace rallies and petitions will even so much as slow it down. I will sign the petitions and I will forward the messages on the Internet, but I have very little hope that we won\'t very soon be involved in a long, bloody, destructive conflict. This is an enormous source of despair for me, because I do not believe that any real good can come of a war. I do not hate anyone. I pity the people whose lives are so miserable, whose hearts are so destroyed, that they could do such terrible things to so many innocent people. Thank you for asking.\"Eternal glory; the belief that America is corrupt\"It occurred to me that in the previous year, someone had asked me about what I thought about President Bush\'s winning the election.  I had quoted a psychic who had said,  The man who wins will be very sorry he ever took the job.   And then, in the next breath, I found myself adding,  There will be bloodshed.   Where that came from, I do not know.   The way I feel now is that nearly anything is possible -- when people create such extreme measures in the name of God and eternal life, nothing is going to stand in their way.  We just heard about a bus accident in Nashville as the result of a passenger slitting the driver\'s throat.  Of course, the first thought is that this is a low-grade, localized act of terrorism.  Our context has changed.  Nobody would have ever considered that on September 1.  We have photos on our fridge of a weekend late in August with friends.  That seems to me to be from a completely different era now.  When we first heard the news, I took it as a dream.  It would not sink in.  This, despite the fact that I had to run to school in another part of Brooklyn, nearer NYC, to get our kid.  As we approached the neighborhood, there were people walking briskly with handkerchiefs on their faces.  The air was acrid, the bits of paper were swirling like an early snow.  The school was orderly with edges of chaos.  As we got back into our neighbor\'s car, we heard the report that the Pentagon had been hit.  It was really like all bets were off then.  That night, we rubbed our kid\'s feet and read him funny poems.  We made more chocolate pudding.  We kept him away from the TV after the first day.  We still do not show him much. The healing started for me when I went to do bodywork on World Trade Center volunteers.  Then, last week, I did bodywork to participate in a Red Cross fundraiser.  That felt really good, too!   Here in Brooklyn, New York, I notice that it is much quieter than normal, and we do not live in a quiet neighborhood.  I have not heard rap or salsa pouring out of someone\'s car in a long time.  There is always a feeling that everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop.  We are in a flight path, and I am often squinting at the planes, wondering if they look too low.  I feel that there is no guarantee of safety -- there never really is, but we just have these ideas that there is.  I really have to turn to God, too.  Also, I woke up this morning thinking that I should talk to my doctor about any possible vaccines, check the first aid kit, buy a couple of bottles of water extra, and get more flashlightbatteries.  I will not, however, dig a fallout shelter.  I spent my whole childhood worried about nuclear attack, and I am not going there now.   I also talked to a woman at the fundraiser, and she said she thought the world was in chaos as never before.  I told her in so many words that that was a generational perception.  That World War II had a lot of chaos, too, for example.   Ultimately, I am turning over my life to my idea of God and continuing to make dinner, etc.\"Arab terroristsMore loving toward my family.

'power of themselves (terrorists)by attack the biggest country.0\"It was a bad suprise for me. I have never think about such an attack for USA... It is ,USA, the biggest country of the world with its social, economic life and ofcourse its geographic condition. Therefore all of the other countries are now under attack, so the 3.World WAR is starting... We have to do something for the people who are in bad condition in USA. \"I thought that there is nobody can do anything to the USA but unfortunately it is not right.  \"I am surprized at how many people are blaming the government for the attacks. I do not beleive that any government could have imagined an enemy using its own resources--especially commercial airliners--in such a way. With hind-site, it is easy to imagine, but imagine yourself on September 10--it was then not even imaginable. I am scared for my children--I do not want them to have to grow up in a world where there is such hatred. I do not want them scared. It is hard to believe that they will be able to be at peace in this world when I as an adult am not capable of being at peace. I am scared and nervous--especially of what is to come. I live near an airforce base. Many of the highschool friends I still am in contact with are in the armed forces. It is just so sad that so many people fail to see what a small world we have become. I hope (and believe) that we are doing the right thing by beginning a war against terrorism, and I hope it will end quickly. I also hope that out of this war will come a lasting peace.\"\"I have not changed my behaviors at all, whith the exception of watching a bit more news coverage, and David Letterman\'s first week back on the air.\"\"They believe very strongly in their closed-minded, hateful beliefs.

My predictable world is, all of a sudden, less predictable.  I grieve for the deaths and all the family members who have lost someone.  I also worry for my son, who could end up being drafted if it comes to that.  I also worry that this could bring out the worst in some people (ex:  a dark-skinned man being killed in Phoenix recently.)  I hope that better tendencies will emerge, but hate and fear are strong emotions and don\'t usually bring out the best in people.  I also don\'t have a lot of confidence in Pres. Bush and I am worried that he is the person leading the country through this.  I\'m not sure he\'s capable of something that requires so much diplomacy and strategic thinking.  I am heartened, though, by the demonstrations of support from all around the world and hope that this will reverse some of Bush\'s tendencies towarad isolationism.  \"\"Probably Osama bin Laden and his cohorts, although I think America itself bears some responsibility because of our foreign policy decisions.\"\"I am more protective of my children.  We have postponed travel plans.  I am more focused on the news.  I am a child psychologist so I am dealing with increases of anxiety and concern in the kids I see.  Also, I have connected with friends and family more than usual.  We are talking with our children about  bigger issues , such as religiion, spirituality, making a difference, the nature of evil, etc. more.  I have cried more.\"\"For power I guess and to make a statement, although in many ways I find actions like this truly incomprehensible.\"Terrorist cells of bin Laden and possibly Iraq\"I am very frightened for myself, my family, our country and the world. My fears are heightened by my 24-year-old daughter\'s vulnerability in NYC. She had an appointment on September 10 in a building across from the World Trade Center and on September 12 in the World Trade Center. Friends and colleagues report similar chance events that saved the lives of people close to them.  The complexities involved in stopping these groups and preventing future calamities seem overwhelming. I suspect that this was only the beginning of the horrors we will face.  Like many around the world, I mourn the loss of life, wake up early with anxiety and bad dreams, and view the scenes with horror. I worry about the bellicosity of the present administration, and the consequences of impulsive action.  I am deeply moved by the response of the American people. The courage and generosity of the firefighters, police and countless volunteers make me proud to be an American. We seem more kind to one another and more generous than we ever have before. \"More cautious and anxiousHatred toward the American culture and government and revenge for past actions of the govenment',3,-5,0,2,5,0,0,0,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.26,0,15.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.78,0,0,30.51,0,0,0,12.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.65,0,81.36,0,11.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,99.44,4.52,0,39.55,0,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.56,18.08,0,0,0,0,10.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.26,Female49bb
'\"Well, I believe the media in their investigations and reports, so Bin Laden.\"In order to make a move with severe implications; but that need the assumptions of specific attitudes  and values (or better: not having internalized certain values).\"Well, my question concerning your question would be \'deepest thoughts  and feelings at what point in time?\' Immediately at the 11th, when I heard about it (that was in our afternoon) I did  not grasp the whole thing. I was thinking about the implications in  the financial markets and, especially about the long-term implications. At the 12th of September I woke up and my first thought was, what a  cold-hearted idiot I seem to be, just thinking about the financial markets. And I felt embarrassed because I had communicated that thought to a friend on e-mail. (I should add that I don\'t have any money invested in the financial market, and I am usually not that interested in it;). I slowly began to partly understand the human tragedy involved in it. I am usually much more concerned (immediately and emotionally affected)  when I hear about people being killed in Lebanon (or Israel). That might be because I have close friends there or/and because it involves the death of fewer people per attack. (I don\'t know anybody personally working in the WTC or the Pentagon). After a while I thought that my emotional concern does not help anybody and I tried to look at it again from an unemotional perspective. I work with  a lot of economists and they have the tendendency to look at things  less emotionally involved. So we were discussing what game-theory has to say about that, and what is rational if you are not considering christian values. I realized that trying to look at it and discussing it from a \'scientific perspective\' helped me to get calmer again and to sleep better again.  Comment: I did not express any political view or opinion, because your study is a psychological study, so I guess you were interested in how people deal with the event and what meta- thoughts they have about it. Hope I could help you with my answer. \"\"I feel a bit embarrassed when revealing that I am  dealing with other things than the attack. E.g.,I  feel more embarrassed to ask someone for a favor.  (E.g. A bit like:\'O.K., the world has other problems now,  but could you please send me xxx.\')\"bin LadenThis was a truly tragic event.  It has taken me a week to fully comprehend what happened to my fellow Americans. I am worried about what the future holds for my children. I am thankful for all the rescuers who have aided those in need. It has made me angry that I have to explain such tragedy to m 6 year old child. I don\'t understand why.  Hatred I am more cautious. I guess someone would do this because they see our country as  sinful  maybe and want to put  right  what is  wrong.   So I would guess for religious reasons or maybe something else (like someone who wants to take over the world or something).The media has said that Bin Lauden is responsible for the attacks.  So I think I would have to agree.\" What happened on September 11, 2001 was really shocking to me.  I never would have thought something like that could happend in  my  generation.  I mean I had just finished studying things that happened at other times in our country.  I don\'t think our teacher even expected it.  I guess now it has hit everyone hard.  It makes people wonder if they are safe.  I know I was scared.  With everything that\'s going on, are we safe?  Or, do we stand a chance against another attack?  I like to think that we do stand a chance.  Hopefully we can win this  war  at  any  costs.\"\"Well I think now, I try to let everyone I know how I feel and I try to tell my parents that I love them when I leave.

I watched the whole thing from the time the 2nd tower was hit, and I don\'t think until I saw the 2nd tower come down, and the absence of the trade towers in the skyline did the enormity of the tragedy hit me.  I have family in NYC and I was immediately worried for them, and for their friends, and I immediately began to realize that I waas gritting my teeth, hoping that none of the dead would be my family friends, and then realized how selfish that was:  all of the victims were someone\'s family or friends.  I was never going to feel a real sense of relief, even when I did learn that my family were okay.  I never really reacted with wanting to get back at someone or some group that was responsible.  I felt more exhausted by grief than angered by it.  Now, I feel a great sense of fear that more of these tragedies will happen in the US.

At first I kept thinking how like a really bad movie it was, only the perpetrators had more imagination, and more cold-bloodedness. In spite of how I think the USA\'s policies may have stoked the flames of hate, I think something must be done to mess up these peoples abilities to continue terrorism.

The organizers appear to have generated a way of thinking that disregards all established authority and undermines the very core of modernity; precisely the goal of a jihad.   About the possible perpetrators: Bin Laden is just the figurehead for a larger, more covert, organization composed of nations and groups who want to undermine modernity or who are hostile toward the United States.  About our response: A diplomatic solution that forces Bin Laden out of Afghanistan is the best choice. Military engagement may mean we will find ourselves involved with a coalition of other enemies such as Iraq.  About my own feelings: I am grieving intensely and feel sad. However, I dont feel less safe. The fact is, I have never felt safe because of traumas experienced earlier in my life. I will admit to feeling somewhat disgusted by the comments of some individuals who have said that their sense of security in American will never be the same. Frankly, there are thousands of Americans who live under terrorist conditions every day. For example, consider inner city youth who live with gang violence, drug wars, and poverty. And let\'s not forget the many, many, women and children who endure domestic violence and rape. The difference between the wtc and these more historical social problems is that the wtc victims have not been blamed for their own  deaths, while inner-city youths, women, and children, have all been dismissed as causing their own problems. Hence, many of us believe that it is acceptable to turn deaf ears and blind eyes to the pain. Perhaps the wtc trajedy will make us more compassionate to anyone in pain.   \"A coalition of islamic and other middle-eastern groups.

Every night when I went to bed prior to the 11th I wondered if there would be a world the next morning.  And every morning when I turned on the TV I flippantly thought I\'d better turn on the TV to see if there\'s still a world out there.   I\'m still wondering as I turn on the TV if there\'s still a world out there but it\'s not a flippant thought anymore.  I\'m terrified and I believe that we are in for more of the same. The thing I dislike the most about what happened personally to me is that I no longer trust.  I don\'t trust TV - what are they breaking to us gently.  How are we being manipulated?

'The human race.I\'m more conscious of the choices I make in my life and the meaning of those choices.Fear and Hate\"I believe that the tragedy that occurred, in its simplest form is truly a matter of light forces vs. dark forces, good vs. evil. Just as in our individual lives, there are matters that require our attention for the sake of our happiness and evolution (in the truest sense of the word - Authentic happiness). These matters are love, peace, unity, freedom, justice, truth and the like.  I believe this tragedy occurred because the human race was not paying attention to what is deeply, profoundly, eternally important in their lives  -   Peace, Love, Freedom, Unity and the like.  Prior events (injustices, discrimin ation, dissnesion, etc.) have been wake-up calls for us to listen to, but we didn\'t. Because we chose to be ignorant, an event of greater magnitude occurred so that  we could not ignore the enormity. Now we\'ll pay attention. Whenever there is destruction, there also is creation. We now have the opportunity to create a very different world than we\'ve experienced before.  Watch miracles happen...watch how the best is brought out in the human race.  Look at the change in perception, the unity - dems and repubs unified; a need is expressed e.g. as supplies, blood, volunteers and there\'s an abundance; tv stations, cable stations and radio stations simultaneously broadcasting a telethon; worldwide unity for support to stop the spread of terrorism...and on and on look at how the rescue workers and health care practicioners risked their own lives for the sake of saving others. I have faith and confidence in the inherent goodness of the human race. This will make for a better world, a better life for our children.  I hope we learn that it\'s no longer necessary for tragedies to bring to our attention, those matters that should have been valued and protected before. It\'s better to learn and grow in peace and joy, than it is to learn through pain and suffering. I believe this is within our free will.\"Osama Bin Ladenvengeance for an unjustice they feel we caused themthey have not changed\"Today, more than two weeks after the event, I would have to say my primary feeling about September 11 is grief.  So many innocent people died; so many more are presently in anguish over lost loved ones; why did this have to happen?  It saddens me to think that the evil in our world is so potent that it could cause this much destruction and depair.  Are we all capable of such evil?  How can we stop it?   \"Envy of freedom\"The tragedy that occured on September 11, 2001 has touched everyone around the world in more ways than one.  I feel terrible about this situation and my prayers go to all those who have been directly involved in this tragedy.   We have lost many people and yet New York has become more united than ever.  The most astonishing thing that came out of this whole event is that everyone has come together to help one another.  I have been attending several vigil lightings for this country as a way to cope with what has occured. What I can not understand is that freedom is something that should be admired and taken advantage of and not believing in freedom is just depriving yourself from having and being so much more than you can possibly have/be. I also get nervous about the next \'move\'.  I am strongly against wars, yet I believe that those behind this disaster should pay for what they have done.   Many may say that it is a tragedy and I do not disagree with that  but in a way I feel that they have done us a favor.  These terroist have brought this country together.  We have volunteers of all kinds helping many that are in need and we have thousands of people who are willing to donate blood for strangers.  This event is something that I will never forget and will always remember when I feel that I can not overcome. I know that President Bush will take the best decisions to bring justice to America!   GOD BLESS AMERICA             \"I don\'t take advantage of people around me because anything can happen to me0\"As one who is dedicated to SELF KNOWLEDGE and who trusts in the wisdom of the DIVINE I found the events to be shattering and very profound yet ultimately uplifting - let me explain. I live in NYC though I only know of people who were directly affected, most closely my husband who watched from his office. I heard the plane and the crash my husband called and told me what had happened so I watched it all on TV - NYU buildings blocked my view of all but the smoke. My heart was rending for the people struck in the terrible gash. I prayed constantly for them and for those trapped in the higher floors. I talked to them and told them to go to the light. I have prayed and cried constantly for them even though I know none of them. I felt the crumbling of those two towers as an event in my own inner being - a crashing right down through my toes and the result is that my own heart is completely broken. I feel immense love and concern for all those directly affected for all those in my immediate sphere and for everyone I see in this great city. I never want this heart to be reconstructed. What broke was a shell, a protection that ultimately kept me from experiencing and sharing my own deep love of all of humanity. Beneath the inner destruction I recognized a steadiness and power that cried freely and openly. My sense is those tears were cleansing and reached far beyond my own self. Lately I see those who have died as having offered us a tremendous gift of love. They have died in an event that has drawn all the eyes of the world sharply into focus over terrible injustices.  I feel no anger or blame toward any of the perpetrators of this crime. I see them as victims too. I feel a terrible sorrow in my heart for those who feel that this is their only recourse. It saddens me that they are convinced that there can be no heaven on this earth for them and that their only choice is to die. Every single life is precious and cosmic in scope and intimately connected to every other life. All about me there are deep and concerned discussions about the cause of this kind of cruel venture and the reasons for such hatred directed to our country. We are very good at noble ideals and sharing but not so deep below the surface we are guilty of all sorts of major and minor inhumanities. I have seen and recognized some and done nothing. I felt I was just one little person and powerless to change the tide of understanding of corporate globalization and the press of Western ideals on everyone, welcome or not. I am perplexed by our countries position on land mines and international child welfare.  Another gift of the ones who gave their lives at the WTC is that I am now totally motivated. It is my intention to work in any way I can to enlighten our mutual understanding of our intimate dependence on one another.  I cannot enjoy my own luxurious lifestyle while I know others are starving or being forced to live as slaves or being deluded into fruitless suicide missions. I don\'t know what to do but I know I will do something.  I thank you for this study it is my belief that all we all need is to be acknowledged and heard. All manner of ills can be diffused if we listen carefully.\"I am trying very hard to be sweeter to everyone. It is hard and I unfortunately fail occasionally. I am motivated to work harder to improve understanding and I am actively reorganizing my career choices.\"I have no idea. I only hope that all of the media and government statements are correct and that they can prove direct culpability. However, when we trace the history back further I wonder how responsible we are ourselves for creating, empowering and motivating such an act. Why don\'t we teach these rebels, diplomacy and other skills of civilazation instead of warrior skills? \"They are desperate and see no way out. They have convinced themselves that they are right. Although I wonder how far the resources and brilliance in perpetrating this act would go if they addressed improving their lifestyle in their own sphere.\"I moved to Seattle, Washington from New York City almost three months ago.  Having lived in NYC for 15 years, the Sept. 11th event really hit home for me in a deep way.  Felt like the rug was pulled out from under me, leaving me to stand on shaky ground.  On the 11th, I first heard news of the attack at 8:00 Pacfic time from my son\'s teacher.  I was in shock, I didn\'t know how to respond, felt numb and disoriented.  After leaving the school, I called my sister who lives here in Seattle as well to ask her for more detail of the event.  As I found out more about it, I feared for my two friend\'s lives who both worked a few blocks away from the WTC.  I couldn\'t concentrate.  I actually had two job interviews that morning and only made it to one of them.  On my way home, I couldn\'t look at anyone, just the ground and I was trembling.  When I turned on the TV and saw the towers crumbling, I was screaming from inside my being.  Were my friends okay?  Were they dead?  I sat glued to the TV, tears just streaming down my face in disbelief.  Those beautiful buildings were destroyed.  I\'ll never see them again.  All those people dead instantly, how many people died?  It was as if a part of me had died.  I even worked in the WTC when I first moved to NYC.  Were those people still working there, were they okay?  Thoughts of the people and the actual building occupied my mind.   For about a week it seemed that my mind and being was trying to process it all and found myself constantly thinking about it or seeking out information to read or see on TV.  I especially found comforting and moved by the symbol of the candle and how people around the world stopped everything they were doing on that Friday with candles and flowers in their hand.  The response from around the world is what touched me greatly. I don\'t want the US to bomb innocent civilians.  I hope that the world unites in seeking out the terrorists around the globe by outsmarting them, cutting off all their assets, finding the terrorist organizations and arresting them all.  To tell you the truth, I wouldn\'t mind if the US were to isolate the whereabouts of bin Laden, to bomb the living daylights out the the man.  But only if they were to isolate his whereabouts. \"\"I do not take my life or anyone else\'s for granted, I am more real and awake.\"out of pure hateOsama bin Laden',4,-4,0,2,5,1.04,4.17,0,1.04,0,0,0,5.73,0,0,1.04,0,8.85,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.13,0,0,1.04,0,1.04,2.08,0,0.52,0,1.04,0,0,4.17,0,0,0,2.08,0,0,0,0,29.69,1.04,3.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,48.96,3.13,0,1.04,0,1.04,0,0,0,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,11.47,19.27,2.08,0,0,0,4.17,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.13,1.04,1.04,5.21,Female49bb

Pearl Harbor was a military base (not that\'s any excuse or condones bombing our beautiful nation), but the WTC was civilians only.  These cretinous bastards believe they\'ll go to heaven and be greeted by 72 virgins (where did they pick that number?  Just curious).        I hope we make a list, check it once, and decimate countries that harbor terrorists or execute these heinous actions themselves.  Peace is not the answer.  Why, you ask?  Because terrorists aren\'t called TERRORists for naught:  they use the Koran as backing for the slaughter and terror of millions.  From what I\'ve heard, the Koran is a peaceful book, and these cretins have bastardized their own bible in order to kill.  The US has always been the great satan to them: this will never stop unless we take serious, lethal action.  These are a people that do not want nor understand peace.  They\'ve been trained from birth to hate us.      I\'m a Christian and am trying to come to terms with these feelings, however I have them wholeheartedly and think we should spare no country in cahoots with terrorists.  Tough shit about civilian casualties:  they didn\'t mind killing 6 thousand of our civilians, and they have actually verbalized that America is weak because of its hesitance to bomb near civilian targets (which is why Hussein used his own people as human shields a few years back). Bottom line:  flatten the bastards, wherever they may roam, and GOD BLESS AMERICA. \"Crazy bastards who have chosen evil as a way of life.The United States  bigheadedness  and unablity to see the ways of and respect other cultures...And an extremely brainwashed radical group of people.\"Personally, I can\'t understand kill thousands of people.

The fact that all my fellow young Americans said  everything happens for a reason , just goes to show how little my generation knows about different cultures.

There are so many other fathers and mothers that lost their lives for no reason.  I\'m so thankful for the people that got out, but it is not fair that some could not get out.  There isn\'t a day when I do not think about the attacks.  It will be everlasting in my mind.  The only thing I can do is pray and hope the ones who lost their lives are in a safe place now.  It is horrible and I hate living everyday wondering if the terrorists are going to come back and attack.

We\'ve been desensitized to this because of all of the movies that use the destruction of WDC and NY as symbols equalling destruction of the United States, like Independence Day.  My grandmother lives on West 29th Street in New York, and she was shaken, but unhurt. It was upsetting at first, but I\'m over it. I\'m getting very irritated by all of the  God Bless America  propaganda everywhere and the candlelight vigils and all that sort of thing. I think everyone should get back to business ASAP, because this is EXACTLY what the terrorist and our some factions of our government want us to do.  Our conservative government is showing us one side of this situation and I am not always believing what I\'m seeing presented on TV, for example, Palestinians cheering in the streets. This is all good propaganda for starting a war, which I am loathe to support. I\'m seeing through all of this as an educated consumer. As an American citizen who has lived overseas for years off and on, I usually don\'t watch US News because it is so U.S. centric. I generally watch the BBC where I can find it. We\'re not considered heros in many countries and it\'s not just the middle east that feels that way. There a lot of antipathy because of our support of Israel, but even the UN and other multinational charities based in the US, are considered as tools of our meddling security agencies like CIA and NSA. Bombing Afghanistan is simply ridiculous. It is one of the poorest and most oppressed countries in the world. Killing people won\'t bring back the dead. We need to determine exactly who did this and apply the appropriate justice. I\'m not sure those in power will make the right judgements. \"',4,-5,0,2,5,0,3.24,0,0,0,0,0,8.1,0,0,3.24,0,8.91,0,1.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.86,2.43,0,0,5.67,1.62,0,1.62,8.1,0,0,0,1.62,0,0,0,0,46.98,0,4.86,0,0,0,0,1.62,0,72.09,6.48,0,5.67,0,0,0,0,0,1.62,0,3.24,0,0,0,24.3,25.11,0,3.24,1.62,0,9.72,0,1.62,0,0,0,0,0,3.24,0,0,4.05,Female49bb

'to teach the americans a lessonnotbin laden and his people\"My initial recation was shock and astonishment: Is this really happening? Strange, to think that those twin towers are not part of the skyline of NY anymore. In addition to concern about the individual people involved, I do feel it\'s not that bad that this event has shown the vulnerability of the US and their dependence on other countries. Bush was really going too far in being arrogant and self-indulgent in international politics, acting as the lord and master of the universe. I can\'t help feeling that something good did come out of this, i.e. the US paid their debt to the UN and Bush may be less arrogant in the future. \"Bin LadenI dont think that my behaviors have really changed but I dont plan on getting on an airplane any time soonThis is the greatest tragedy I have ever lived through.

How can I speculate other than restate what I hear in the media?Not at all.\"The acts of terrorism were horrendous attacks on the value and sanctity of human life. Only if you do not view life as sacred can you set out to kill. I find it hard to imagine how some people must sit around and dream up the most effective way to kill the largest number of people possible. They did a good job. This was a great way to murder thousands of people at once.  I was and am shocked by the enormity of it all. I\'ve long ago stopped watching the news because I find no value in reiterating the same information I\'ve already heard. I listen to the radio (NPR) because I think their stories help me make sense of what and why this happened. I remain deeply concerned about the violent response (both collective and individual) that the US and its citizens may have to these events. If you value life, you cannot justify taking it, even in retaliation for murder. It makes no logical sense. So while I hope and pray for peace, I am very aware that the US will likely respond by killing. Similarly, I know that some individuals will find justification for their long-held prejudices against Muslims (and those who appear to be Muslim).

It was early evening in my part of the world when the news broke. We sat there, feeling stunned, unable to stop watching.

I cried when they showed close-ups of the people standing in the windows - that made it seem so real, and so truly horrible.  My feelings toward these events are complex. I know that if I was American, I\'d be demanding that something be done. But I don\'t think this is easily solved, and certainly not solved with violence. I think the point for the USA government must be to ask: Why did this happen to us? And what can we do to prevent it from happening again?

I think that our Nation is a wonderful place, and it is not like we are forcing them to live here.

Tragic, limited, an accident. When I left my office and found others gathered around the televisions and saw the burning towers and saw the replay of the second jet hitting the WTC, I kept thinking,  How did this happen?  My thought was that terrorists are who they are and do what they do, but that we should have had better defenses--airport security, intelligence, something. I still realized that I was seeing a tragedy of major proportions, but I was still thinking, with the memory of the previous bombing, that many people would be killed or hurt--but many would also survive (most on the lower floors, in fact). The collapse of the towers was the moment that I truly felt overwhelmed, I think. The physical reaction was immediate and, even though I knew exactly what it was, surprising. I wanted to sleep, right then, in that heavy tiredness that follows an adrenaline surge, but when I tried, I could feel every drop of blood racing all through my body. I called my sister who lives nearby where they have poor television service and told her to get a radio on and to be careful. She said that she had trouble hearing me and she was a little irritable with me at the time. Later that night, she skipped a graduate class to come by and watch the news with me. I didn\'t panic and I didn\'t  borrow trouble  by assuming anyone I knew was in either location, although it was always a possibility. I think the state of alert and dread and horror was very much like the week my father was hurt in a work accident, the week after his death six months later (always possible, but unexpected at that point), the week my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and the week preceding her death. The physical reaction lasted until the following Monday--that  thief on the run  tiredness, restless sleep at night, a sense of being isolated from any emotion unrelated to the situation, sudden waves of weakness. Students I saw, who were experiencing this reaction for the first time, including one who saw the second plane hit on live television, were most surprised and frightened by the physical symptoms because it was the first time. I knew and I was surprised and frightened. I kept saying,  There\'s been so much. I should be used to this by now,  thinking that exposure to so many natural and man-made tragedies and crises (I was born in 1953)should have somehow innoculated me against this. After awhile, I realized, how could anything? And yes, maybe it is appropriate that I would feel the same as I have for very personal disasters. I have been surprised at my ability to deal with the responses of others from a calmer place than usual--I don\'t like every response, I don\'t agree with every proposal or every choice of expression of feeling, but I do have some optimism (Me, optimism? That\'s different.) about how we will deal with this collectively while knowing with some certainty that we will also make mistakes that come back to haunt us. That\'s being human in a world of humans. At the same time, I know how deep and how permanent these wounds are. For two or more generations, the lives and dreams and careers lost in this event will also haunt our country and the world. \"Because they hate this country.

Our quality of life is so special and fragile, too.  I want to move to the country, dig a hole in the ground, and fill it with water.  Buy a gun, several attack dogs, and raise vegetables and chickens.  I would if I could.  I get so angry when I think about how vulnerable I feel and we as a nation are.  I am angry that I go along, doing what I\'m supposed to do, and other people, at their whim, can threaten all of that.  My life was already pretty stressful, and now I just want to sit in a heap and stare.          \"bin Laden was the person behind it.  I do think that the United States should realize the political roll it played in thiss event however.  We are not blameless.\"I pay more attention to the TV (well, I watch the news a lot more).  I have spent as much time as possible wiht friends and family.  I try not to fight over petty things anymore.  I am more aware of the feelings and needs of others.\"\"I am still feeling a bit nervous about what happened.  I tend to find myself jumping up at loud noises that I would usually ignore.  At night it is hard to go to sleep because I still see some of the horrific images that were shown on tv in my head (such as people jumping from buildings, fire and explosions,etc).  I was having nightmares up to about two days ago.  In general, I still remain very tired from both lack of sleep and stress.  I am worried about what will happen in the future, whether or not there will be a war.  I cannot say that I am in favor of a war, because I think it will only lead to further death and destruction.  There are too many scary weapons out there that culd be used against the US, so I think it would be worth the time it takes to find another solution to the problem.  I still feel a bit of sadness.  So many people died for what seemed like no reason.  My heart goes out to them and thier families.  I remain grateful that I am still here and that I have my family.  Luckily, no one I immediately know was killed.  If anything, I am hoping that we as a society will learn from this disaster.  I am hoping that I too will remember how precious life is and that I should be grateful for what I have.  Things will never be the same.  It is uplifting to me to see my community pull together to help in the rescue efforts (such as sending money, donating blood, etc).  I have noticed that people are just a little nicer to strangers than they were before.  I find myself more concious of those around me.  It is good to know that the country is pulling together.  My roommates and I joined the rest of our neighborhood in putting candles on the porches.  It helped a little to know that others cared.\"They feel that they were wronged in some way.

'I cannot fathom any reason ...\"It felt surreal, like it wasn\'t happening ... I especially felt like the day was in slow motion.  Time went by very slowly.  Also fear.  Where would they hit next?  Is it over?  Is this the beginning of war?  And crying ... lots of crying.  Crying when the building fell, crying watching those poor people trapped above the fire, thinking how horrifying it must be.  And then crying over hearing about the cell phone calls from the planes.  Almost an overwhelming sadness that something truly horrific happened.  Better bit by bit .. but it\'s slow.\"\"Terrorists, but beyond that ... no idea.  Although I personally believe Osama bin Laden is the only one with the $$ resources and knowledge to carry something like this out.\"\"Not many ... more concerned about being in a large city, but nothing that would make me stop and change my life.  \"To make the point that they can do it.  Also to embarras the US.\"At first I thought the reports must be a mistake, sort of like  War of the Worlds .  Then I hastened to contact people I knew who might be affected, and once I determined they were OK, it became just another piece of news. I lived in NYC for 13 years, used to work in Tower 5, frequently took the PATH, etc., so I have many memories of that location.  It will not truly seem real to me until I actually visit the city and see that the towers are no longer there.\"Individual terrorists supplied with funding by some larger entity.I\'m thinking twice about flying in the near future.Religious extremism of all forms breeds illogic and hatred.\"Although I did not personally have family or friends injured or killed in the attack there are many people who live in my area of Long Island who did.  Obviously, watching the TV clips of the WTC being hit was gut wrenching and the idea that other people could perpetrate such an event was horrifying (despite the clear historical precedents for evil inhumane acts against other people).  The first 2 days our hospital was on full disaster alert.  As a physician I was on standby to be called in instantaneously.  We ended up not getting any trauma patients but since I\'m a psychiatrist we\'ve been seeing many individuals in distress who have lost family/friends. Many of our previous psychiatric patients have become extremely distressed by the events, even incorporating them into their delusional systems. Our family used to spend weekends in New York City at the WTC Marriott (they had good w/e rates) so we had many good memories there.  Seeing it in rubble contributed to the feeling of emptiness.  Also contributing to the sense of global anxiety is uncertainty about military actions (my step-son just turned 18 this week) but also a sense of concern about the level of religiosity and militaristic patriotism that is being stirred up.  I do not want this to become a Holy War of Muslims vs. Christians and I see the rhetoric of people like Jerry Falwell to be frightening as well. I\'ve been impressed with Rudy Giuliani\'s handling of events; George Bush seems like even more of an inept dolt than I\'d originally feared.  (If he says  Make no mistake about it  one more time I\'m going to scream.  Hopefully this will also point out the idiocy of the  Stars Wars  system as a lynchpin of future defense spending and the even greater idiocy of the tax cut.)  I worry that we will begin attacking Afghan poor with no relation to any of this in our frenzy to get Bin Laden and those who are harboring him.  I have no problem with appropriate action against the perpetrators, I just don\'t want us to be killing innocent people in the name of avenging the deaths of our innocent people.  I\'m also afraid of witch-hunt and prejudice being ignited against Muslims and Arab-Americans here in the US, the vast majority of which have no involvement with or sympathy for Bin Laden.  At the same time, we should consider what aspects of our behavior may have contributed to some of the displeasure with us in the eyes of others.  In our quest for oil to run our SUV\'s we have operated in ways that are less than nice.  While this does not change the horror of these terrorist acts, we should look at ourselves from many vantagepoints as well.  Our complacency and sense of superiority have also shaped our behavior in our lack of security and we will have to trade some flexibility to address these very real security concerns.  A final concern is our economic future which was getting shaky as it was but now is even more worrisome.  \"Watch more TV -- about an hour a night; usually don\'t watch any.  Listen to news and not music on car radio.  Planning to volunteer with crisis counseling efforts for victims of WTC.  Bin Laden and his network; other fundamentalist groups that have peripheral alignments with him\"I do not believe that the US government has a spotless track record when it comes to supporting particular causes and/or nations. I could easily see how certain groups and countries would feel like they were victims of heartless US capitalism, imperialism, and the like. My tendency is to think that someone has taken certain events very personally, and has decided to launch a personal crusade, bolstered perhaps by religious justification, against the US for the wrongs it has committed against them. \"\"I do not want to fly anywhere. I was hoping to go to Europe in the spring, but the attacks and the fear of what will happen when Bush begins strong retaliatory efforts have made me reconsider. I am spending less money for items and services that are not absolutely necessary. I am getting in touch with more friends and family lately, including friends in Europe, and I make it a point to see if they\'re doing okay. I shifted topics in my Health Psychology class to make sure that my students learned more about coping, social support, and adjustment right after the attacks so they might have some additional tools to use as they make sense of it all.\"\"I do not believe that Bin Ladin is the only one responsible.I believe the US government is partially responsible, and terrorist groups, most likely including Bin Ladin, are also responsible.\"\"It\'s been very difficult for me to get myself to write this. The attacks on the 11th impacted me in some ways that I didn\'t expect. I happened to be watching t.v. at the gym when it was happening. I saw the second plane hit the second world trade tower. I thought I was watching a clip of some movie footage. It was just unbelievable. That first day, I listened to the radio whenever I was in the car, checked the internet for news, and when I finally got back home, I kept the t.v. on. But after that, I couldn\'t watch anymore. I felt like the horrible information was coming at me from all sides. It was overwhelming and, in my view, unnecessary to keep showing the attacks over and over again. Everywhere I went, people were talking about it. It was just too much for me. I mean, maybe the constant barrage of depressing stories is helpful for people who have a hard time getting in touch with their feelings, but for me it was torture. I was already depressed when I first heard about it. I didn\'t need to add salt to the wounds. I was fairly successful at avoiding things until Friday of that first week. But I was in such a bad mood all week long. Angry and incredibly irritated primarily. Then my schedule slowed down and I had a chance to think more about the events and what they meant to me. Also, on Friday morning, I talked to my mom and her maid of honor, Maureen, who ended up stranded at my parents\' house the whole week. That was not a pleasant experience. Until that point, I hadn\'t known of any family or friends of mine who had been victims. Maureen had 3 family members - cousins and nephews - who worked in the World Trade Center. Two were okay, but her godson had not been heard from. He worked on the 110th floor. His wife had just had a baby, and he\'d taken a few days of family leave to be at home with her. The Tuesday of the attack was the first day he had gone back to work. That story pretty much did me in. I felt incredibly sad and angry, because these events simply did not have to happen, but I also felt jealous and alone. To me, events like the attacks bring people together. Over and over again, I heard people talking about how the attacks made them reevaluate their priorities, made them realize how important their spouses and family were, how they shouldn\'t take their partners for granted. First of all, being a single person, I kept thinking that I have no-one like that in my life. I have no one who I am so intimately connected to that my entire life would change if I were to lose them. I used to have someone like that, and I remember what that was like. I want to have that again. I also felt angry. A few years ago, my priorities shifted and they have never shifted back. My top priorities are relationships with people, family, friendship, love. Why is it so hard for people to remember how important those things are? When everything else falls apart, that is what you have left. That never changes. I wish it did not take a national tragedy for people to figure that out. And I wish the results were permanent, but I know that they won\'t be. Other than those feelings, I feel like I have no control, and we as a country have no control. I also feel like I cannot do enough to help. I can give blood, but I\'ve been trying for the past 2 weeks and they have not had time for me, unless I want to wait for hours and hours. Plus, I do that on a regular basis anyway. President Bush keeps trying to encourage people to fly, telling us that the airways are safe. But frankly, how the hell would he know? He didn\'t know that they weren\'t safe. He didn\'t know that things were going to go dreadfully wrong. I feel like it is simply a way to try to help the airline industry and the economy. And I certainly don\'t trust him to handle this situation well. It is frightening to think that he is our president at a time like this. All in all, I feel there is very little I can do to resolve this situation. It is too much out of my control. The only thing I can do is work on bringing peace into my own life and into my relationships with others. At times like these, perhaps all we can do is try to comfort ourselves with the thought that there is good in the world, that violence is the exception and not the norm, and that we have to go on living our lives.     \"\"For theologic, strategic, semantic ideas.\"\"No, I don`t believe my life has to changa because of this attack.\"\"Everytime I think about the attack I realize that this bad experience has only made us stronger, now we know we`re able to overcome this event.
