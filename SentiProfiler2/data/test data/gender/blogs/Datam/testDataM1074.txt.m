..Stranger,

I’ve never felt stranger.

Tho’ this is not the last time, it feels like the first time, ever being so confused.

My mind is toxic, it has the cure for everyone else, yet ‘tis a curse on my own… state of mind, state of body, and place of being. There is something deep inside me -- a scab that needs peeling. Letting go of past grievances is something I’ve never been good at. But at last, my toxic mind is coming to its salvation. It has found, again, its freedom.

Stranger, 

Have you ever felt this strange?

Things seem to be speaking from every direction, signs fly from the heavens, and demons whisper from the floor.

That there is somebody, after everybody, that knows the feelings you have; that thinks the thoughts you have, and sees the world as you see -- inside the mind of another, yet so apart there is no knowing of truth? A heart can be broken, but can it be repaired? Heavens no. Hell no. Purgatory…. I am there, my mind is a desolate wonderland of cursed thoughts and abhorred desires to feel nothing. Yet, I want something. I wish for all to be good. NO, I wish for myself to be well and to be well unwell.

Stranger…
You have me wishing.
