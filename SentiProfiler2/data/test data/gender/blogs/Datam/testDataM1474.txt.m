Dean's latest favorite toy - the ElliptiGO - is the basis for his attempt at the record books for "most distance covered on an elliptical bike in 5 days". He will be ellipting (?) his way down the coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a distance of over 500 miles. You can follow him here . I first saw the ElliptiGO at the Death Ride last year . Pretty cool that you can get the athletic benefit of an elliptical trainer while enjoying the outdoors. Here are some pics, courtesy of Eric C Gould : Leor Pantilat won for the 2nd year in a row (3:41:47), aided by a wrong turn by leader Geoff Roes (who still finished third in 3:51:51 ), and out-kicking Max King (2nd, 3:47:39). Joelle Vaught, who won in 2006, ran alone in first most of the race to win (4:13:53) after key rival Kami Semick dropped from stomach issues and flu-like symptoms. Bev Anderson-Abbs came in 2nd female/1st masters (4:29:40), a very strong performance just a few weeks after running a 50-miler, and Darcy Africa was 3rd&nbsp; (4:37:12). It's definitely worth reading the SacBee story and Leor's account to get a full picture of this great race in the mud. Or you can read the account from the man-sized banana at the Hwy 49 crossing. Congrats everyone! Many of us know 41-year-old Topher Gaylord as a seasoned ultrarunner, with finishes at UTMB, Western States, Top 10 at the Miwok 100k, 4th at the TNF Challenge 50-mile, and many others to his credit. A few of us may also know him from crewing for his speedy wife, Kim, or as the guy in the Race for the Soul movie who blew up and came back from the dead for a sub-24 hour finish. But did you also know he’s the President of Mountain Hardwear? Yup, as of this week. Free shwag for everyone! (ha, ha) Columbia Sportswear Company Announces Appointment of Topher Gaylord as President of Its Mountain Hardwear Subsidiary 20-year Outdoor Industry Veteran Brings Rich Global Brand-Building and Operational Experience March 01, 2010: 01:20 PM ET PORTLAND, Ore., March 1, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Columbia Sportswear Company (Nasdaq:COLM), a global leader in active outdoor apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment, announced today the appointment of Topher Gaylord as president of its wholly owned subsidiary Mountain Hardwear, Inc.

PERFORMANCE ELEVATED™. www.mountainhardwear.com &nbsp; Yesterday I had the great pleasure of joining 200 runners for the Caumsett State Park 50k in Lloyd Harbor, NY, put on by New York Ultra Running . As the USATF 50k Road Championships, lots of speed demons were out to enjoy one of the first sunny days to come after a long, hard northeast winter. What better way than a 10 lap loop course with fellow ultra warriors? As I warmed up with Team Inov-8 runner Ben Nephew , we agreed that the day had a lot the right ingredients for a breakthrough PR. Although the temp was in the high 30's, the sun would warm up the day to ideal low 50's by the halfway point. Short of some wind gusts, this was MUCH better than snow/sleet/sub-zero Caumsett 50k's of the past. Plus there were a lot of great runners here - 2x defending champ and course record holder (2:56) Michael Wardian , Scott Jaime (pronounced Hi-Me) from Colorado, 50k Masters American Record holder Dan Verrington , 24-hour American Record holder Mark Godale , 24-hour National Team member Phil McCarthy, Montrail runners Annette Bednosky and Jill Perry , the great Scott Jurek, and a half dozen more that could go sub-3:30 on a good day. I felt like a kid meeting my favorite rock stars! &nbsp; (Ben Nephew and I sport the new Team Inov-8 shirts) &nbsp; (Staying warm at the start) My personal goal for the day was to improve on my 50k PR (3:37 at the 2009 Ruth Anderson 50k ). My speed work was going INSANELY well over the last three months, particularly by teaching me that I could be in a lot of pain and still hold my form. To achieve a PR, like any stretch goal, you need three things. First, you need to show up (check). I know that sounds simple, but as we all know, getting the start line healthy and ready can be tough. Second, you need the opportunity, like a day of perfect weather and runners faster than you (check). Third, you need to believe that it is possible to achieve something beyond your best (check, thank you speedwork). Let's DO THIS! At 8:30am, Suffolk County Legislator Jon Cooper sent off the 50k runners (30 minutes ahead of the 25k runners) and the front pack quickly spread out. Wardian, Jesse Regnier (in his first race beyond 8 miles), and 2:19 marathoner Malcolm Campbell went out hard, running 5:30 min/miles. Scott Jaime and Malcolm Campbell each ran solo at a sub-6 pace a few steps back, and Dan Verrington, Ben Nephew, Mark Godale and I clocked 6 min./miles in the next chase pack. Dan was doing most of the work in our pack, letting us know right up front that he was shooting for "3 and low teens since the 45-49 50k American Record is soft at 3:17". I guess he would know - it's his record! We finished the first lap in 18 minutes. My God, this was fast. &nbsp; (Mark Godale, Ben Nephew, and Dan Verrington chasing Scott Jaime) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Michael Wardian and Jesse Raginer finish up lap #1) We got sight of the Womens race on the out and back section, and front runners Annette Bednosky, Jill Perry, and Yolanda Flamino were sticking close to each other. Last years champ and course record holder, Kami Semick, was not present today so it was anyone's race. They were all keeping each other in sight. &nbsp; (Jill Perry leads Annette Bednosky and Yolanda Flamino) Ben Nephew was nice enough to help pace the pack with Dan, but around lap 3 (mile 9) Dan picked up the pace charging the uphill grades and dropped us. Mark Godale fell off the pace, and Ben and I speculated that he probably wasn't in peak shape thanks to daughter #3 recently arriving. We both had 3-year-olds and knew how that could crimp a training plan, but #3? Fuggetaboutit. &nbsp; (Scott Jaime gives a thumbs up) On each subsequent lap, we molted layers of hats, gloves, sleeves, wool, etc. until we were down to our tank tops in the 45-degree air. Ben continued to do the lion's share of the pacing, running with a short and powerful stride from all his snowshoeing. I was nursing a sore shoulder from a sex-related injury (best if I don't provide detail on that one, but let me recommend that you stretch out before ANY strenuous exercise), but otherwise feeling strong. The aid station volunteers at both stops were amazing, and we barely had to slow for whatever we needed. On lap 6 (mile 18), my body demanded a bio break and I made a absurdly efficient 20-second stop at the port-a-potty. Ben wished me well, and from that point on he would be little more than a dot on the horizon. That was okay though - I knew the last third was going to be a three-night stay in the House of Pain, and it felt proper to venture into that valley of darkness alone. &nbsp;(Local ultrarunners not obeying the speed limit) I wasn't alone, however, since thanks to the loop format I got to see EVERYONE. The New York Ultra Runners were having a great day and making the most of the early signs of Spring. I exchanged atta-boys with 78-year-old Sam Soccoli from North Babylon, NY, and the famous Roy Pirrung who was defying his 62-year-old age with a sub-5 hour pace. 70-old Patricia Delaney was also making good time, and always had a smile on. They sure breed 'em tough out here! At Lap 8, I hit the marathon mark in 2:48 (almost a PR!) and fought desperately to hold my form. Michael Wardian gave a few words of encouragement as he lapped me, slowing but still on course record pace. At the turnaround, I could see that Dan Verrington had passed Scott Jaime, but Scott was keeping him in sight. Ben was still holding on strong and was about a minute ahead of me now. The Womens race found Yolanda Flamino in front after dropping the hammer on lap 3 and gapping the other women by a good 15 minutes. Annette Bednosky, however, was picking up speed in one of her classic negative split finishes. &nbsp; (Ben Nephew keeps cranking) As I entered Lap 10, my stomach knotted up, my head started spinning, and my muscles began twitching like crazy. My pace had slowed to a 7 minute mile as I walked the two aid stations to try and get more liquids in. The pain. My God, the pain! I could feel my heartbeat in the back of my eyeballs. But as the mile markers reminded me, this was almost over. Annette was kind enough to pick up the pace and run along with me until the last 1/2 mile, and I gave it everything. I crossed the finish in 3:20:48, good enough for 6th overall. &nbsp;(Mark Godale and Dan Verrington talk about the race) I laughed out loud as I crossed the finish line. Did that just happen? Did I just take 17 minutes off my PR? Either the training is going well, or I have been seriously sandbagging for a long time now. As I spoke with the other finishers, it turns out many of them had breakthrough days. Michael Wardian (2:55) had beat his previous record by 40 seconds, with Malcolm Campbell (3:04) getting second with a great performance. Scott Jaime (3:13) had passed Dan Verrington (3:15) to claim third and the Masters win, but Dan set a new 45-49 age group American Record in the process. Ben was quite pleased with his 3:18 best on this course, and Mark Godale charged in the last laps to finish a few minutes behind me. Jesse Raginer clocked a 3:28 in his first 50k - not bad at all! &nbsp;(2010 Womens 50k Road National Champion, Yolanda Flamino) (Scott Jaime gets the Masters payday from RD Amy Goldstein) Yolanda Flamino won the Womens division in 3:34, with Annette Bednosky (3:43) taking second and winning the Masters division in a time well under her goal. Jill Perry (3:47) fought through some tough spots to hold onto third. ( full results ) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Scott Jurek, me, and 2010 50k Road National Champion, Michael Wardian) &nbsp; (Sporting the hardware with 3rd place Womens finisher Jill Perry) I felt like an Olympian with all my medals (a gorgeous finisher medal, a USATF medal for 6th overall and a USATF medal for 2nd in 40-44), and was tickled to get the $50 check for third Master. Paydays are rare in this sport! My thanks to RD Amy Goldstein, her wonderful volunteers and sponsors, Howard Nippert and the crew at USATF, and the nice folks of Long Island for putting on a great race. Thanks to the opportunity, assistance, and support you provided, I had a breakthrough day! &nbsp; (Schwag overload! I'm in heaven...) Michele Wallace from the San Diego News wrote a fun article about Mike and Kim Rouse, a couple who (somehow) gets along while training for ultras, Ironmans, and even the Ultraman. I love their quotes about each other - it's truly a match made in heaven! You can read the whole article here . &nbsp; (Photo courtesy of poet Ollie Lind ) Have you ever noticed that half of the stories in endurance magazines sound like Mad Libs for people in recovery? Sometimes I swear they just plug in the facts: " [Name] got into running after recovering from [near-fatal disease or accident] just [random number] years ago. "I was in bed, feeling sorry for myself, [another random number] pounds overweight, and my [body part] looked like [bad food or construction analogy] . I decided the best way to beat [near-fatal disease or accident] was to celebrate the health I had one day at a time. I trained for months and completed [major race] . I'm not embarrassed about my [body part] since it gives me a chance to educate others about [near-fatal disease or accident] . I've now hooked up with [charity of near-fatal disease or accident] to run more, and hope to inspire others with [near-fatal disease or accident] and be living proof it is possible to overcome." Unfortunately it's easy to gloss over the message in these formulaic summaries. In truth, there is something very powerful at the heart of these tales. This is Part II of my long run revelations: "To lead a ful
illed life, embrace death." I've had the good fortune of losing some friends and family in the last six months. I know that sounds backwards, since the pain and loss that immediately accompanies such devastation is soul-crushing. But by embracing loss and authentically internalizing the myriad of feelings that surround it, life feels more precious. Life IS more precious. If we are living, we are survivors. We should all embrace life as fully as our formulaic heroes. It's such a shame that most of us can easily avoid our own finality in day-to-day routine, distracting media, and pharmacologically-enhanced lives. Comfort is good, and probably necessary for some level of sanity, but it's important to regularly remind yourself not to take it all for granted. I often feel this is the reason many of us enter endurance events and push our personal limits - we surround ourselves in pain and adventure so thick that we can't escape asking ourselves the very basic questions of what makes us happy, what makes us tick, and what gives life meaning. Through the pain, we grow, and for days afterward, we cherish every breath, every sunset, and every laugh. At the 2009 Western States, I got so deep it got scary . But the serenity that followed lasted for weeks, even months, and was nothing short of life-changing. If 27+ hours on the trail is all it takes to reach that level of enlightenment and peace, it may very well have been the easiest thing I have ever done. Embrace your finality. Treasure the moments you have. See life in its fullest hue. It's the best way to honor those who left before you, and makes for MUCH better stories. - SD [You can also read Long Run Revelations, Part I - There Is No Such Thing As Work/Life Balance, Only Life Balance ] I've recently seen a large increase in traffic to this blog from blogger.com, meaning more and more bloggers are following me. Great to have you! Just in case it's helpful, I thought I would share a few tips picked up from analyzing traffic over the last few months. We all have different goals for blogging, and it's totally fine if you don't ever analyze your traffic or try to boost your readership. But I will say once you start looking into it, you will be surprised how many people are connecting to your insights. Here a few quick and simple ways to boost your traffic: 1) Use an analytics service . Wonder how I knew about the increase in traffic from blogger.com? My analytics service helped me track it. If you aren't using one, I would suggest you do. Most of these services are free - StatCounter and Google Analytics being two of my favorites - and will start giving you fascinating data immediately after you add a few lines of code to your template or add a widget. Imagine being able to see who sends the most traffic, which search words bring people to your site, and how folks navigate your blog. This week my top referral sites were run100s.com (Stan Jensen's encyclopedic site on ultrarunning), wikipedia (largely on Dean Karnazes inquiries), and forum.somethingawful.com (from a forum conversation that linked to toenail removal), and my top search terms were "caballo blanco", "coconut water", and "cross country championships". It's a fascinating time suck. ;-) Once you get some analytics, a few of these other suggestions will make sense. 2) Add the LinkWithin widget . If you look at the bottom of my blog entry, you'll see a thing that suggests other blog posts you might like. That's LinkWithin , and it's a very simple free widget to add. On average, it has increased my traffic 18% without having to do a thing. But more importantly, it helps convert a lot of first time visitors into reading 2-3 pages. Odds are a few of them will be more regular readers. 3) Bring on the pics ! Behind Google, my #2 contributor of traffic is images.google.com. This is from people looking for pictures of trail running, parks, people, etc., and has continuously been one of the big attractors of new readers to my blog. You can help Google figure out what your pictures are about with some clever image naming, such as "2009_xterra_trail_running_world_championship_hawaii_max_king_winning.jpg". Think about how many image searches might hit that - xterra, max king, hawaii trail running, etc. - especially over time. I've found a direct correlation to the number of pictures in a blog entry, and the number of visitors over time. Basically you can't ever have too many and if you name the images correctly, they will pull readers in for years to come. On the flip side, I recently tried out "Snapshots", a widget that popped up a pre-link window that did not do much for traffic so I turned it off. I've also added "recent comments" on the right, but haven't seen a noticeable change in traffic. But I find it useful, so I will leave it up a bit longer. Got a great tip? Let me hear it! It's how we all get better. Thx, SD Olympians and all-around running superstars Dathan Ritzenheim and Shalane Flanagan dominated the USA Cross Country Championships in Spokane, WA, this weekend. This was Dathan's third and Shalane's fourth national cross country title. &nbsp;(Dathan Ritzenhein, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Joining Dathan (34:34 for 12k) on the national team are Minnesotan Patrick Smyth (34:52), Chico, CA's Scott Bauhs (35:01), fellow Eugene, OR runner Ben Bruce (35:16), Admore, PA's Bobby Curtis (35:22), and Gresham, OR's Ryan Vail (35:25). &nbsp;(Shalane Flanagan, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Shalane (25:10 for 8k) led by 51 seconds, with 10k superstar Molly Huddle (26:01), Flagstaff, AZ's Amy Hastings (26:09), Olympian Magdelena Lewy Boulet (26:09), Boulder's Rene Metivier Baillie (26:26), and Mammoth Lake, CA's Sara Hall (26:27) rounding out the team.
