And not just for porn! Somehow I've either got a nasty, nasty infection or a hellacious mold allergy. Either one is possible. I woke up this morning feeling like death warmed over. No alarm - just a vast vat of uck to bring me to.

I have classes to teach. Ugh.

Blackboard to the rescue! Thanks to the power of the internet and telecommuting, I was able to teach my classes over chat rather than hauling my carcass in to infect the world. Rather than limiting the discussion hosting class over chat liberates it. Rather than getting disrupted by giggles and snores, we're able to focus on content rather than setting.

I'm definitely going to incorporate this fully into my classes next semester.
