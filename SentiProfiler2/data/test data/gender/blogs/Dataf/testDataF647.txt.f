Yesterday morning I was annoyingly awoken by the changing of the guards, which made me think - maybe I spoke too soon about this normal thing.  When I say changing of the guards, I don't mean the fancy speal they do at Arlington National Cemetery (how great would that be though?).   What I do mean, is that at around 4am-ish the lovely gentleman who so kindly have watched over the house all night and patrolled now go home to their families and taking their place are more nice gentleman.  Really, I am not being facetious, they are very kind.  As the new guards come in, they are instructed to check their guns to ensure they are locked and loaded (ahh, I learn the meaning of locked and loaded! - but shouldn't it be loaded and then locked?).  Well,  we are in The Ghanny, so not everything is in tip top condition, so if you don't spiffy up that gun, you can imagine how many times you might have to ensure it is properly loaded, or locked - heck, I am not even going to pretend I know what they are doing.  All, I know is that they are making that 'chich-chich' noise over and over and over again at 4 FREAKING AM.  It was like a literally wake up call - no, Anna, your life is not normal.  Better yet, the neighbor guards thought this was going to be a musscle fest, so they started flexing too.   Hello, we are sleeping.
