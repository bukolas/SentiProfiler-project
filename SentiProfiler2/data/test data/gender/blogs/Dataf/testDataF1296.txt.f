This week in home video, we've got a slew of brand new releases coming your way. Unfortunately, only a few of them were critical darlings, but the ones that are critic-approved are pretty good ones. Among the new releases are the latest in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, the most recent offering from Disney's traditional animation department, a couple of action flicks that didn't perform as well as they would have liked, a computer animated update of an anime classic, director Pedro Almodovar's latest film, and a boxset of a brutal South Korean trilogy. Dig in, and hopefully there'll be something worth your while this week!
