You know it takes very little to qualify as being a 'nice guy' these days.

You pretty much have to just not be a complete prick, and already you're higher up the respectability ladder than many in this cynical era.
If you, humble reader, happen not to be from England and are wondering what it's like, then allow me to attempt a description.

First of all, remove the idea that all English people are positively reserved, yet jovial and kind-hearted people. That cliche died almost a century ago.

No, instead imagine a vast expanse of grey concrete and stained, decaying brickwork; its gloomy litter-strewn pavements populated by silent introverts studiously avoiding eye contact, for fear of verbal/physical confrontation or possibly a suicide bombing.
In fact the general city atmosphere is now one of island-like isolation. People are becoming ruder, less civil even to those close to them, and some base values of politeness and chivalry have been all but forgotten. 'What's
he/she after?' and 'What's in it for me?' are two of the most self-posed questions.

But hey I should be thankful, because it certainly helps increase the impact that a simple good deed or act of kindness has on those around you. Having the words 'please' and 'thank you' garner a surprised reaction is a strange thing to observe, but an altogether pleasant one at least.
