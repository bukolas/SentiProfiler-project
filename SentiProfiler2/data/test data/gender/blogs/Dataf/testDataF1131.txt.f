I do love Shaun White. I LOVE that he could have ridden down the center of the pipe and still taken gold, and yet, he put forth the ride of his life…and had FUN…you nailed it…he has fun with what he does. I'm so bad, I don't know anyone's name…I just get a kick out of watching them all. I don't love watching hockey, though…because my personal belief is that NHL players shouldn't be in the Olympics. I get WHY they opened it up to professional athletes…but I don't have to LIKE it. I cheer for our American athletes…because I'm an American…but I can TOTALLY appreciate the fact the woman's snowboarder from Australia put forth a better ride, and be happy for her. (I just would have been happier if an American woman had won) I also totally admire an athlete like the woman's skeleton rider, who had a horrific injury, and came back and was able to compete at the Olympic level again.
