I am a family of people suffering from arthrits. My dad and uncle Tibs' bodies were so disformed it was pitiful. My hands are swollen mostly in cold weather. I am in pain most of my day. I have been told I would sooner or later have to have hip replacement. HIP REPLACEMENT, this is so scary. I my town all we have are quacks that can't be trusted for anything but taking our money. This I know because I have friends who have gone to these doctors. Doctors here think getting old means 'YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT. I have no way to get to a surgeon that I can trust and you say 'stress' causes more problems with my arthritis. What am I supposed to do. Thanks for the shoulder.
