Action Life is all about our own actions.

Actions are , "each and every" thing we do.Actions are the result of composition of different things, such as "Condition", "Choice" , " Habit", which favour the final action. Every individual action depends upon these three things. People will do the things if its their habit, or if the condition is favouring them to do so or if its the choice they have made for themselves for their good. So one person can admire you and another can be a person who treats you bad, or irritates you, does something wrong, will be considered as a bad person. But he is acting according to his condition, habit and mostly choice. According to him he is as good as Shri Rama in Ramayana. So all good and bad things are perspective.

Every thing in this world depends upon the action. One's action can create some condition for another. One can regret about his own action. For doing any action, condition cant be changed , habit can only be change forcefully, but one can make right choice in perspective of everyone so that there will be no need of regretting for our own action.well, in the end I want to say that I was thinking to write a blog from long time which is turned into "action", because I was dying to ... ;) another factor of edmitting an action ;)
