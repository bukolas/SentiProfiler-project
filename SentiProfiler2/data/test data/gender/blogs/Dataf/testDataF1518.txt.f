Where I come from it’s….

A small island of the coast of North Carolina called “Cape Hatteras Island,” known for the tallest Lighthouse in our nation. It’s also known for its beaches, white sands, surfing waves, and it’s treacherous Diamond Shoals. It has a very rich, full history in many areas of our past; wars, pirates, and tourism. Many stories fill my head and my heart over flows with the memories I myself have on that little sandy beach I called home for most of my life. 

My family moved to Cape Hatteras when I was a very young girl, I believe I began the 3rd grade there on the island. We moved across the states from Bremerton Washington with my father’s job in the US Navy. Of course moving to the island at that time brought great change in my life and back then it truly was just a little island, full of mom and pop shops and restaurants, little tourism, and 1 full military base.

As a child our days were spent; playing with the neighboring children, playing in the park, or making a trip over the dunes to play at the beach. In many ways it was ideal yet in today’s society by many standards it would be considered lacking on so many levels.
