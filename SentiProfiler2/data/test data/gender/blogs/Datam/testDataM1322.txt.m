Also remember the weakness to alot of computers is the actual Web Browser itself as well. Every Browser (and System) has its weakness. Just Google "PWN2OWN" the Mac was hacked in under 10 seconds this year, and this was a fully patched system. Every System has its weaknesses. As long as you're web smart about the links and sites you visit, you'll be fine. Also if you have a good memory, use different passwords. I use about 20 different passwords (Yes, I'm that paranoid :D) and each one of them has a different category e.g. Personal, Work, Bank, Mail, WebServers, etc... the daft thing alot of people do is use the same password for everything, e.g. you might sign up to a website and use the same password you do as your PayPal and E-Mail accounts. BAD IDEA!!!
