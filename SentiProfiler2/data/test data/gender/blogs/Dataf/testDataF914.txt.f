I know that I can't stay like my current life as cooking and studying music but English, but hunting job. 

Don't be worry! I'm getting better and I can do what I wanna do. 

I'm getting interviews from a few companies next week. What I can do is that just I talk about myself honestly. So, I don't wanna prepare something as I seem to be competent. I have confidence and I can do anything if I want to. It might take a time a bit though. 

Whatever, Daddy, I have some melody for you and wanna compose it. Would u forgive me to do it?
Then I would be workaholic.

Aki
be happy to Everyone
