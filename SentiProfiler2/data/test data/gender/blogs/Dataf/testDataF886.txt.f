..I can't believe I am going to do this. I am doing the thing I make fun of other people for doing. I am making a good-bye MySpace blog.

I know!

I was just going to delete my profile without a word, but that just seemed so cold.  I can't just fade away because I can't quit you people. (of course I mean you blacks)

I have fun here. I may have fake profiles, but my connections to people are as real as they are in the real world.

Am I just doing this for attention? Of course!

I mean it too, though.

I will continue to watch over all via God Smith, (he sees all, even when you are masturbating), but I am done living my life so "out loud" for the world to see and I am done with this profile. When I come back, (and you know I will) it will be from a different profile.

Take care of yourselves, MySpace- and each other.

P.S.

I do so love you miserable bastards.
