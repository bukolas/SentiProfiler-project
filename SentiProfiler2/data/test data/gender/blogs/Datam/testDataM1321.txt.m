It was about 10 years ago when carpal-tunnel first hit me. Every time I put my hand on my mouse, I'd get spasms of pain in my various parts of my arm. I tried special ergonomic mice and trackballs, but they didn't help. I tried speech recognition software, but it was a joke. Whether I could continue with my profession was becoming an issue. I even tried moving the mouse with my feet. Nose mousing was next. Then I discovered the Wacom tablet. For a long time, it was a godsend. The pain almost went away -- but not forever. A couple years ago, the pain started returning. The Wacom bought me some time, but it was not a permanent solution -- at least not by itself. Somebody recommended I read Pain Free at Your PC by Pete Egoscue. I'm glad he did. This book has saved my career (even though I'm not exactly following its advice). Its main point is that carpal tunnel originates with the spine -- that is, a spine in poor posture. When standing straight, the spine is in an "S" curve. Think of the neck, shoulder blades, lumbar and tail bone. When standing up straight, they are shaped like an "S". The spine is a balanced spring with the skull balanced on top. Your arms are hanging straight down and your skeletal/joint/muscle system is at peace. When sitting with poor posture, however, the spine is in a "C" shape. The lumbar curve is gone or reduced. The spine is a cantilevered, stressed support for the head and arms. The spine, in turn, is supported by the small muscles of the back. But those muscles are meant to steer the spine and body, not support its weight. Now, what's the connection between the spine and wrist pain? Think of the song: "The head bone is connected to the neck bone..." In this case, the spine bone is connected to the shoulder bone, and the shoulder bone is connected to the arm bone. The bones and the muscles and the ligaments and tendons are connected. It's a system. When the spine is in a "C" shape, the body's structural support is out of whack. As Egoscue puts it (I can't quote directly, I lost the book), a poor posture will gradually make your bones and muscles disintegrate turning your body into a pain-wracked, arthritic, crumbled ruined husk of its former self. Of course, proper posture is the solution. But how do you make that happen? It's not easy, especially for slouch-meisters like me. Egoscu's solution: yoga. As I understand it, yoga will strengthen muscles that usually don't get enough exercise. His book has a number of yoga exercises that are specifically designed for carpal-tunnel suffers. He has exercises for light, medium and heavy PC users. His approach makes sense to me. Unfortunately, the story did not end there for me. I tried to do the exercises, but they hurt like hell. And they took a long time. And I don't have the discipline. I failed.
