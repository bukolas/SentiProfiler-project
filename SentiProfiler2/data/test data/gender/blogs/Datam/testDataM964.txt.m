OK.. I have had enough of typing the answer to the gay or straight question. 

When I'm asked this every day, maybe 10 times per day.

The answer is......................  I am LOVE!!!  

I love all beings. I do not mean Bi sexual either. My sexual preference is Women.

BI Loving: The evolved being, capable of loving, caring and hugging for all humans.

In this day and age, if you are still Homophobic, you are way behind in evolution.

The Gay culture runs the world. They run fashion, entertainment and many of the top businesses, which make the world turn.  Ask somebody...

I go out The Gay clubs every now and then because the energy of the music and the people is very Happy, very pleasant. I love Gay people.   

Some of my closest and best friends are Gay and lesbian and I value them dearly (Sara Halford and Rico Hernandez). They are My Family practically.

So when I'm asked, If I'm straight or gay, I will refer all to this blog, to fully explain why I don't wish to be in the ignorant, straight, category. But then I'm not Gay either.

Like I said..... I AM LOVE

I choose to love all human beings under God and hang out and work in Happy loving environments. Partying at the gay club is fun. The music is great. The girls come in and feel free to dance without being harassed.

And a friendly note, to all those who are Homophobic..... I bet all the clothes you have in your Closet, were designed and made by a Gay man... think about it. Donâ€™t bite the hand that clothes you....
