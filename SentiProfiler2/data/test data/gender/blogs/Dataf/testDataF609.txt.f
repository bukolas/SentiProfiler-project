big piles of each color right on the carpet, and even made a mixing pile of purple. Little Picasso had made such a mess!I grabbed towels, a bucket of water and every bottle of stain remover I could find, and immediately went to scrubbing like a mad woman. All the while yelling "Are you watching him?! Do NOT let him move!!"After lots of scrubbing, and seeing how much progress I had made, I started to breath again.Taking a deep breath, I began to laugh... I still have paint stains on the floor. Jake is sitting in the tub covered in paint.I ran out of stain remover and need to go to the store.The kids haven't had lunch yet.AND, Kailey has to be at the orthodontist in 35 Minutes!!Everything after that was a complete blurr. Somehow I got it all done and made it to her appointment, and On Time at that!At some point in between all the madness, I did take a few seconds to grab my camera.They were taken at the time where I was breathing, so they are blurry and most of the paint was cleaned up. On Jake too! At least I captured something, right? Can you believe this little monster?All I know is; Thank God for Oxi Clean, and the fact it was kids paint! Every year we go All out for the fourth. We drive up to the next state and buy tons of illegal fireworks. I say "we", what I really mean is Jason. Here's how it really works. He begs to go stop at the fireworks store. Swears we won't buy much. Then I follow him around the store as he snatches and grabs, like a kid in a candy store.
