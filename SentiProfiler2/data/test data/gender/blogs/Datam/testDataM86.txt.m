In Kolkata - Here in kolkata the things ,people ,perception of people are so different.The same intro talk which would otherwise have inspired hundreds of youths to join our YES+ bandwagon is also not making any difference. God/Guru certainly loves fun thats for sure. And time & again makes us realize us to surrender since we are instruments and HE is the musician.  In the meanwhile I did few satsangs and quite a few are lined up for coming days. Even attended Vikram dada's satsang and had a knowledge session with him exclusively for YES+ .

I saw AVATAR in 3d which was like superbly fantabulous.Something that's beyond someone imagination.If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favour and watch it. I m yet to see 3 idiots !!!

And right from the day we have landed here the thing i have been doing the most is eating and eating and eating some more. I guess I have also put up some weight.

Will keep ou all posted about the happenings here.

Jaigurudev !!!
