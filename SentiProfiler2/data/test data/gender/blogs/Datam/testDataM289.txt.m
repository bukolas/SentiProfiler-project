The 1980s fashion revival is coming to a close. But the revival on earlier periods, particularly from the 1930s and 1940s, remains popular. So what to do then with the military fashion trend which has proved the stalwart of fashionisers' wardrobes for the past 2 years? Evolve it. Play down the over-the-top glam pieces taken directly from the 80s, and infuse the historical military look with something far more classic, far more relevant to 2010 fashion. Introducing the Autumn (Fall) / Winter 2010 evolution of the men's military clothing trend. The military shape always has been a fashion driven trend for the colder months; but for Autumn (Fall)/Winter 2009-2010 designers such as Gareth Pugh, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and Burberry have modified and transformed the combat uniform from the past to the now. Gareth Pugh, with one of the most unusual menswear collections for A/W 09-10 has brought inspiration from the likes of German officer overcoats from the Second World War to the metal chain mail suits that were worn under suits of armour. Movies can also be seen as a heavy influence in Pugh's A/W collection with feathers for shoulder decoration as inspiration from The Crow including the Gothic ripped trousers and black boots and the metallic body combat suit, a similar cut to Christian Bale's costume in Equilibrium. A few short years ago tailored shorts for men were bang-on-trend; we were moving firmly away from the 1990s and a refined cut of short promised a comfy, distinguished, yet wholly less casual look. They didn't make it big everywhere, a bugger to find in Australia I ventured off to Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge for my navy pair from Paul Smith and they've worn beautifully. But for the gent wanting an updated look for their Spring/Summer 2009 wardrobe where to from here? I've spotted this a few times in our street style coverage, and the latest instance comes from Sweden; men pinning their blazers together either as a feature or to give an even slimmer fit. There aren't all that many fashion accessories for men when one considers the sheer volume that exist for women. And of those that do exist, quite often you find that they're heavily associated with a sub-culture or movement that you're simply not interested in associating yourself with. Brooches for men are, however, one of the few men's accessories which can cross the sub-culture divides, are perfect for both Spring/Summer and Autumn (Fall)/Winter seasons, and are slowly making a come-back. Men's fashion trends are few and far between; yes, a lot of women's trends are eventually adapted to the men's market, but if 2010 men's hair trends prove anything it is that classics will always rule when it comes to men's fashion. Unsurprisingly it's no different when it comes to men's suits. Mark my words, Deep-V T-shirts are going to be the bane of men's fashion trends in Spring-Summer 2009.And no, it's not the Viagra. Not that I use it, but if you want some for kicks, give me a call, I know a guy who knows a guy who lives in Springvale. I'm kidding. Anyway if you may have noticed, this colour has been slowly sneaking its way onto the catwalks the last two winters - bright blue that is. Actually, I'm not even sure what hue they're using.
