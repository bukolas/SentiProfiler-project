3lb loss! In the past 5 years I think I've only twice ever lost 3lbs in one week, so this was a bit of a surprise. But I have been on track and then some, this week. Last Thursday I went to see a Nutritionist who, after looking through the detailed questionnaire I'd filled out and testing me on her machine, told me I most likely had a couple of mild food intolerances and too much yeast in my system which affects my digestion and ability to absorb the right nutrients, thus either causing, or contributing to my CFS. The upshot of this is it has been recommended I cut out sugars, yeast and fungi from my diet - this includes fruit juice, dried fruits and many fresh fruits too, as they are all high in sugar content - and take pro-biotics and Chromium supplements to allow my body to recover. She didn't think I had full blown Candida, but felt I was leaning that way so should look to address it. I don't appear to have a wheat intolerance, but can't have bread because of the yeast. And it turns out the fungi thing means I can't have Quorn either, which is a bit of a bugger as we lead a largely vegetarian diet and Quorn usually features once or twice a week. It seems mostly I'll be following a GL diet, which Maggie had been looking at anyway. Am I certain this is all correct and not bullshit? No. You don't need a medical degree to call yourself a nutritionist, and the vega machine she used to test me for my reactions to different food stuffs hasn't had full clinical trials. However, I'm prepared to give it a go. It looks a few stages more advanced than Crystal Therapy, and I'm not being recommended to do anything unhealthy or life threatening. If it turns out to be complete bollocks, then at least I won't have lost anything. What this has meant is I now daren't snack on anything I shouldn't. It's no longer just a case of extra calories delaying or preventing weight loss, but the wrong things can feed the yeast growth. And if I'm to give this a shot then I've got to do it properly, otherwise I'll never know. I've not given up my 2 coffees a day yet, but I fear it's only a matter of time...

Was on track all week, with the exception of a tub of popcorn at the cinema on Saturday when Maggie and I went to see the new Alice in Wonderland movie (visually lovely, but lacking any real dramatic tension). No matter how many advances I've made in other areas of my life, I cannot go to the cinema without having a tub of popcorn. I would be completely unable to enjoy the film, spending the entire time missing the popcorn. Fortunately we very rarely go to the cinema Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4.4lb - 186.4lbs Body fat: 26.1% Total Weight Loss: 88.6lbs &nbsp;0.4lb loss Back in the right direction again. Forgot to mention last week it was the 5th Anniversary since I began the journey of heathly eating. I still haven't figured out whether that's a good or a bad thing... Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.4lb - 187.4lbs Body fat: 25.6% Total Weight Loss: 87.6lbs 1.8lb gain To be honest, that could have been worse. This past week has seen my daughter's birthday celebrations, a trip to see my stepdaughter and her children and a weekend away with my wife, including trips to cafes. I'm actually craving vegetables. Well, nearly... Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.8lb - 187.8lbs Body fat: 25.7% Total Weight Loss: 87.2lbs 0.8lb loss! I'm very pleased with that, although somewhat surprised as there have been a few little extras this week. However, for anyone who doesn't know, one of the greatest achievements in the world of bloggers dealing with health and weight issues has been Kepa, or Fat Lazy Guy , reaching his target of being under 100kg, or 220lbs. What makes this such an astonishing success story is 3 years ago he weighed over 500lbs. And what makes this so special for me is we've been exchanging blog comments since he started. If you like, I knew him back in his days of struggle and massive self-esteem issues, long before the bold and confident guy he is today. So this isn't about some distant person who must be superhuman and I couldn't relate to. This is very real. Here's a wee video he made charting his success . It almost brings a tear to my eye Here's a link to his post Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4lb - 186lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 89lbs 1.4lb loss So my unexpected gain last week must have been a blip as I've dropped down below my weight from 2 weeks ago. I'm happy with that :) Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 4.8lb - 186.8lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 88.2lbs 0.8lb gain? Sigh Don't really know what's caused this. I know I did have a couple of little extras this week - a scone on Wednesday, and a cup of hot chocolate on Friday, but these shouldn't have been enough to cause a weight gain. It's not so bad when I can see what I've done wrong, but this is disappointing Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 6.2lb - 188.2lbs Body fat: 26.4% Total Weight Loss: 86.8lbs Another 1.4lb loss! A near faultless week again, but I'm surprised to lose over a pound again. Due to the CFS my activity levels aren't that wonderful, so realistically I don't feel I can expect to lose much over 1/2 a pound per week So I'm happy with that :) Starting Weight: 19st 9lb - 275lbs Current Weight: 13st 5.4lb - 187.4lbs Body fat: 26.2% Total Weight Loss: 87.6lbs
