Ive been clean from the filth of world and fallen in the grace of God and so far shit has worked out better then I ever thought they will, now it's time to fix me! today I thought bout my environment and some people are like "lmao Noel you stupid..... Not dumb stupid but funny stupid" and then there's others that are like "you fucking idiot stop fucking up" lmao and I began to think and I was like hey why is person number too saying that ...... I FIGURED OUT WHY!! Lol because ......... "hey fuck face ...... Maybe if I enjoyed being as miserable as you are with what's happening then maybe I would actually want to try harder".

Now world I don't want you to think it's directed at a particular person or place but this is something that happens everyday no matter where Iam so it has nothing to do with anyone it's just a general comment to show that Iam much different then the rest in the sense that my life is directed towards one goal, it's a goal I have to meet and anything that comes in between is just temporary, again what that means is that my road to changing the world with film has just began and there's a high possibility that I may step on a few toes along the way. People that know me know that I don't care much towards athority which means I need to be my own boss OR get paid wayyyyyy more. Lol anyways look make your dreams come true and know we are all human and make mistakes, fuck where you are now, you need to get to where you want to be.
If that means taking a big pay decrease to make it happen then fuck it, if you ment to make it in what you want then you will. God has a fantastic plan for all of us, I know he's opened my eyes to make me see how possible it is now can you do the same?
