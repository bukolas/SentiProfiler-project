the Novelista Barista today featured me in her blog. I am extremely flattered by what she had to say. Take a look!A 'catch-up' post is on the way, probably tomorrow... watch this space! x When I'm in Malta, I generally avoid shopping like the plague. Not only are most prices higher, the Euro isn't exactly in my favour either. But last time I was there, I was determined to get my hands on the new Chasing Pandora CD, The Driver and the Dancer. And ever since then, I haven't really been able to turn it off.
