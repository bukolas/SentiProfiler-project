Osama going Green!  Al Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden has called in a new audiotape for the world to boycott American goods and the US dollar, blaming the United States and other industrialized countries for global warming.
In the tape, Bin Laden warns of the dangers of Climate change and says that the way to it is to bring "the wheels of the American economy" to a halt.

Wow! So now the "World's Most Wanted" man is also talking about Global Warming - now that sounds interestingly ironical to me. He is the same person who masterminded the 9/11 attacks, killing around 3000 people!! He has also been linked with numerous terrorist activities across the world. So is it right on his part to talk about Global Warming?

Showing concern for the future generations after all the atrocities that he has committed in the past... talk about hypocrisy...

Everything said, i am quite excited about doing an intensive research on global warming in quest for its authenticity. Expect a post on it latest by Monday.

love,
