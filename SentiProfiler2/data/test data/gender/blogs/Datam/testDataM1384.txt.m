well here is one true person who i seriously i have to say mokkaied to hell!! I have constantly mokkaied her for months in row, but i dont know how she has the heart but she will one fine day tell me "dai naye ethavuthu mokka poduda" hehe.. man this girl is the height of ego but once u break into that she will become a gem of a friend.. I dont think there is even a small reason for which we have not fought and bang bang bang ego clashes and everything but still the fact remains we are two of the best friends..she also is one person who has shown me distance does not matter in carrying friendships only ur heart doesnu.. she is very hot headed so dont ever mess with her when she not in mood if u dont want to get blasted to moon.. one person who always says what she did and does is the right thing.. but all given and taken.. anoo u ROCK dog!! i will never have the worry of not being born with a blood sister, U R THERE sis. have a great life!!
