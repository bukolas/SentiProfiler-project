Apparently if the rain we are getting this weekend were snow, it would be about  three feet deep. It is also pretty windy. Therefore the streets are awash with dead umbrellas rolling like tumbleweed across streets and frightening the dogs. The corpses are flung every which way including upside down. A few are neatly disposed of in garbage receptacles. Others look positively dangerous.
