shanki as i call him has been more than a friend to me rite from the time i met him in 6th standard..it has been 10 years since we met ...and through those ten years i ahve always had a friend with whom i could confide even the deepest of secrets...he knows me better than i myself do...thats the truth...
i have never seen him in a serious mood except on the field ...there he is a tough competitor and a shrewd cricketing brain....i lve the way he plays the game and had been lucky to play once under him in a very serious match...;) 
u stay with him for half an hour and he will surely come up with soem prank and bring u down with laughter...
we ahd together roamed the length n breadth of adambakkam n the surrounding suburbs...and those days would remain evergreen in my memory...
