I'm just going to type some random ramblings to distract me from this urge to self harm (and as a random related thought, can I just say, I hate the picture for this group. Triggering much?)

I don't want to do this but I find it so hard to resist. You being a complete douche right now and making me cry is just the cherry on top of my really crappy day and I don't think I can hold out much longer. I know I'll feel so much better when I see my skin crack and break but all the same I'm fighting it....I guess I should've learnt by now, there's no point in fighting; I always lose...
