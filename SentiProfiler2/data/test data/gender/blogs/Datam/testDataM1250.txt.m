A Northwest Side man listed as a potential threat to judges tried to enter the Daley Center with four hunting knives he had just purchased, according to the Cook County sheriff's office.

Kevin J. Long, 48, of the 4500 block of North Milwaukee Avenue, walked into the building Tuesday afternoon and passed through a metal detector while his bag was sent through an X-ray machine.

A Cook County sheriff's deputy saw images of several knives in Long's briefcase. When asked what was inside, Long allegedly said it was "just papers," according to a news release from the sheriff's office.

Long allegedly told investigators he had come to the Daley Center to visit the law library and had forgotten about the knives, which he said he bought earlier in the day as a gift for his brother-in-law. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, both of which are felonies.

Long has been on parole since November after serving 15 months in prison for telling a witness in a civil case that he would kill the witness's child. His name also is on a list developed by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Cook County sheriff's department naming individuals who may pose a threat to judges or court officials.

Long also has been arrested 18 times since 2000 for various incidents, including being caught in a judge's chambers and public indecency.

Cook County Circuit Judge Donald Panarese set bail at $350,000 on Wednesday, according to Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.

He was denied bail on the parole violation, and Panarese barred him from entering any Cook County courthouse unless he was required to be there and unless he was accompanied to and from the courtroom by a sheriff's deputy, Simonton said.
