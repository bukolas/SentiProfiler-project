So once again I have ended a shift at the place i work. It was less than fun and really made my head hurt.
Now to my issues. I have found that people suck. I say have a good day and the reply is pretty much nothing. What causes people to be so rude? I am just some guy working at a store trying to make some sort of liveing. So the journey begins. I have started fresh upon this page. My ideas that shall flow upon here for all to see. This is the beginning of my thoughts lets see what dark ally we get lost in. For you have started a hike along the narrow path which is my inner most ideals. Lets see how far my mind can take us.
