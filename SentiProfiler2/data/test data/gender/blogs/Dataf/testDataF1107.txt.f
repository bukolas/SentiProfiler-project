On Wednesday night, I was honored to be a guest on CUNY TV's Brian Lehrer Live, a weekly current events show filmed here in New York. I was there, along with Marisa Meltzer, the author of Girl Power: the Nineties Revolution in Music and Rob Walker, who writes the NYT's "Consumed" column and is also the author of Buying In: What We Buy and Who We Are. I was there to talk about the YouTube phenomenon that is the haul video. If you've never seen a haul video, it's basically a person doing on camera what you usually do when you come back from a shopping trip: excitedly show what you've bought to anyone who'll listen. Except in a haul video, you show it in front of your webcam and then post it on YouTube for an audience of thousands. Most haul videos are made by teenage girls, and most of the items been shown off are clothing or makeup, though a thorough browsing of the genre reveals that there are haul videos about a whole range of products, including groceries. It was a really interesting discussion, one that touched on issues of consumerism, teenage belonging and self-identity and on the cultural emphasis placed on women's beauty and the products we're encouraged to buy to achieve it. As you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about haul videos in the last few days, and I think there are a few noteworthy things going on here. First, I think it's important to note that these videos are predominately made by teenage girls, and that the vast majority of the money they're spending is on clothes and on makeup. As I mentioned in the segment, the average American woman will spend over $20,000 on cosmetic products alone between the ages of 13 and 29. And that doesn't include manicures, pedicures, haircuts or colorings - that's just for makeup products.  Once you add in those services and include other services like tanning and waxing, the number goes up over $40,000. Over the course of a lifetime, the average American woman will spend about $500,000 on making herself beautiful. Half a million dollars. That's a studio apartment in New York. It's two full rides to medical school. And while a lot of women never go tanning or get a pedicure, and while products and services obviously cost less depending on where you live, as well as a number of other factors, that's still an enormous percentage of women's collective earnings being spent on making ourselves beautiful. As I said on Wednesday night, I'm in no position to tell anyone how to spend their money, but I think it's important to take a moment and imagine all the other things we could do with that money, and to carefully examine the reasons why we spend it on making ourselves beautiful. I should clarify that I don't think these women are buying these products because I think they're vain or vapid.
