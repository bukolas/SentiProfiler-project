i always thought that having a dream is stupidâ€¦ because people always say, instead of keep dreaming, why can't you be practical?? stop dreaming and come back to reality! this is life!! well, what's life without a dream, eh? now i know it's OK to have a dream, no matter how unreachable or ridiculous it is :) even though i know some dreams are hard to reach, i'll still try my best to chase that dreams of mine. sure, maybe i might not be able to reach that dream. but hey, when i look back in my life, at least there won't be any regrets! because i'm a dream-chaser instead of a dream-crusher.
