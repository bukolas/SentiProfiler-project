.knew Mr. Jughead/Payasam through a common friend
...never have met him in person, YM has been the medium of communication.

Based on the limited interaction and his blogs, I would say he is a rational and insightful thinker. Sometimes, tends to get confused between tradition and US life or at least tries to analyze it a bit too much. 

Intellectual, sometimes my sounding board and a little caring.

John, hope the testimonial is exactly the way you wanted it to be.... :)
