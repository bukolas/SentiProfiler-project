So when it comes to war, I'm not sure how to define my stance. Overall, I'm a pacifist and think war is always wrong. New rule: Mankind never gets to say it is divinely created, enlightened or intelligent while blowing the shit of another country. 
But...
I know fighting can be inevitable. Even the Tao Te Ching refers to defending oneself and, let me tell you, I embrace this philosophy as wholeheartedly as I do my pacifism. You take a swing at me buster, you best prepare for some knuckle sammies. Not very Christ-like I suppose but a) I'm not a Christian and b) modern Christians rarely follow this admonition anyway.

Now, some will argue that war and defending oneself is much the same thing. They see war as a good thing, a thing to be practiced often. Peace is not an option; only killing and bloodshed. They revel in this power. These sorts of humans brag of "military might" and having "the best trained, finest Army in the world" just as Napoleon did or Caesar before him. They lust for fighting and dominance, dominance over the whole Earth. Does it truly make a difference if these mad men are Americans and not Germans? Since when is killing and destruction a virtue to anyone but the fabled denizens of Hell itself? War is a poisonous goo filling their hearts and thoughts with taking a hill or planning bombing raids never mind the collateral damage.
That's what I just don't get or put my head around. How can one delight in the slaughter of war? But it is so. I see it daily. There are millions of my fellow Americans who see war as glorious and divinely sanctioned and are proud to send our soldiers into death, cheering along like Roman cheering gladiators into the colloseum arena. 
War is not sport but it has been transformed into one in these modern times where we can watch the participants play on Youtube or CNN. It's like a live action video game except when our soldiers die they don't get to hit the reset button and try the level again.
