My name is Lala Ema. Iâ€™m French with Malagasy origins. I was born and raised in Aix-en-Provence then lived in Paris until I moved to the south of Granada in Andalucia (Spain). I love this city and although I sometimes miss the buzz of the city life and my dear old Paris, my heart is taken for ever by Andalucia and my Spanish boyfriend.I'm a designer and recently started an activity as a wedding planner in Granada.
