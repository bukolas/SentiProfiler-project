To be honest, the only car rental company I've used is Enterprise, but I wouldn't want to use another company because their service is excellent. Their slogan, "We'll pick you up", is the absolute truth. Every time I've needed to rent a car, for whatever reason, they've cheerfully shown up on my doorstep. In the age of mediocre customer service, it's going above and beyond the call of duty. Their cars are clean, inside and out, and well-maintained, and if a car might have a scratch or ding, it's noted.
