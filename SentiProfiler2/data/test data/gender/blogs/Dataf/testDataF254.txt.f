I went on my search engine and typed "How long can a person go without food" and found that it could be pretty long. especially a person like me. I also found out, actually it verified the fact that I cannot go without water for more than a week. Everything hurts when I try to eat. EVERYTHING. I tried everything so I decided not to eat anything. I am in pain all the time and I am sick of it so today I had lots of ice, one cup of coffee and a teaspoon of peanut butter. I regretted the coffee and peanut butter because even though it was easier on the esophagus, it hurt like heck when it reached my stomach. So there is no winning. I woke up at one-thirty this afternoon because I was in such pain last night and stayed in bed all day, except to make my coffee and eat the dreadful peanut butter.
