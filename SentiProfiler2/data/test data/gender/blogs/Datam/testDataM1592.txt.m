I enjoy occasionally going lingerie shopping with my lady, initially out of curiosity about why the heck they cost so much more than men's undergarments, but i soon developed a keen interest in finding the right lingerie for my wife, as a way to spice up my sex life. Finding the right lingerie can be tricky; one person's cosmetic lift may be another person's dysfigurement. It is therefore helpful that a married man should occasionally take time out to go shopping for lingerie with wife, for her comfort, his libido (and money), their bond.

The first step is to determine what shape her body is. is she a pear, a ruler or an apple? A pear is a figure that is curvy. It's larger in the hips than in the tummy and has a smaller top than bottom. "Pears" generally have large thighs and rears as well. A ruler is a figure that is fairly balanced with little curve. Most "rulers" are very slim women. An apple figure is one that is much larger in the chest than in the hips and thighs. A woman who is apple shaped usually has a bit thicker middle but slim, toned legs. So figure out which figure she has first in order to determine which lingerie style will flatter her body the most.

Once you've determined her shape, the next step is to explore the different styles of lingerie that work with it. You should have a good idea of what styles of lingerie you (you and your other half) are looking for before you go shopping with her. Also be sure to shop at a nice lingerie boutique for the greatest selection and quality.
