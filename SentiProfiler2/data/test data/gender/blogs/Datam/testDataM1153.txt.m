5. TRAFFIC is critical. Due to the earlier point, scale becomes much more important - if you are an advertiser, wouldn't you rather go to the vendor that has aggregated a lot more content and traffic than a relatively smallish site (unless of course it is a niche site and you are in that market)? Therefore, we see the emergence all sorts of sites and services such as technorati, digg, etc. that do not product produce any substantial content on their own, but serve to index and aggregate the other content on the web to drive traffic to their sites. Seen in this context, the Microsoft Yahoo merger makes a lot of sense. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! accounted for 15.6% of all U.S. Internet visits for the week ending Jan. 26. In the same period, Google's share was 7.7%.

6. Relevance drives Traffic. Web search engines are the ultimate example of this fact. Often, the most advertising dollars go to those services that can accurately and comprehensively aggregate and serve out relevant resources to consumers. Relevance drives traffic, relevant traffic drives advertising, advertising drives revenue. Revenue drives profits. Profits mean that you can kick back and sip pina coladas without having to work 80 hour weeks and read blogs like this one!!
