Ok, so I am not really creative. In the writing sense. Currently I have been puzzled with an assignment for my Intro to Theater. The project is to write a final scene. RIGHT... Well, I have a thought, that is I am DEAD. Not really. I have been thinking about this assignment for a while now, and I think I have finally figured it out. I am now in the process of thinking. =) My thought is to write a very simple story line. The setting is a coffee shop. You have two friends who haven't seen each other in four years. While they are talking they become distracted with all of these different costumers in the coffee shop... and that is as far as I have made it. I only have until Monday to write this fine piece of art. For it is due on Tuesday!!! I am in search of my creative self!
