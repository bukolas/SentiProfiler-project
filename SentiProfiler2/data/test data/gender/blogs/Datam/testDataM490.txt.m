I lost my nanny to cancer when I was in Primary School, we were so close. She went from being so fit, looking after 3 grand children, collecting (WALKING) them from the primary school every day, with me in the pram, when all of a sudden me and her were shopping when she collapsed. I remember that day, she was coughing up blood. But what was I to do? I was like 4/5/6. I thought nothing of it. The rest was a blur but I do have a slight memory of seeing her in Marie Curie. She died on New Years Eve/ perhaps Day.
