First off-if you and your fellow politicians really want to address this problem head on, cut your own taxpayer funded health benefits to that of the typical middle class families. That will be the light the fire under your behinds, so to speak. You should also propose that Congress and the House have a mandatory 5 day workweek as well-because how do you enact change if you are not there to come up with solutions?
