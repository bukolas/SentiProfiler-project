WOW. I am one of those moms that said I would never drive a minivan.. Well we shopped around for ever.. When I finally tried the Sienna, I loved it. We owned a 2005 Sienna which got totaled in a car accident in which my entire family was in (me, hubby and 3 kids under the age of 6). No one was hurt. In 3 days we purchased a new one.. I absolutely love it. It drives awesome, it's so comfortable and there is tons of space for 7 passengers and lots of cargo space.
