for the past few days my brain has been turned off. i don't know why it is, but i go through spurts where i just turn off. maybe it's my brain's way of telling me it needs a break. my mind is very good at justifying breaks. no need to eat healthy ty, you just worked out. that's something my brain would say. it's a real bad influence on me as is my heart. they are always scheming of ways to make me look like a fool. i still like them though.
