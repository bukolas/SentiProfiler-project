Talk about a welcome change in narrative. Think back to 2009, and pretty much all the story-lines in women’s tennis were decidedly negative — poor quality matches, Dinara Safina at number one without a Slam and then breaking down under all the pressure. It was an annus horriblis for women’s tennis, summed up by a lack of standout moments — bar Kim Clijsters’ fairytale US Open success. But even that had a flipside, raising the question of how she could win a Slam in just her third event back on tour.  There are more exciting matches and more positive story-lines. Justine Henin is back and has already reached two finals this season, in Brisbane and at the Australian Open. Her Belgian compatriot Clijsters is also playing a full calendar this year and already has a WTA title to her name so far in 2010. Serena Williams has defended her Australian Open crown and remains right where she belongs at world number one. And there is evidence that those who wrote off Venus Williams may have to revise their opinions. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion is on a 10 match winning streak, having won WTA titles in Dubai and Acapulco in February.
