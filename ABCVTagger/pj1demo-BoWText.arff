'Thank God the day is over.  Now I can go home to see my grand baby.  My grandbaby gives me lots of pleasure.  All I need is her little smile.  That little smile can drive all of my stress away.  I don\'t like to write.  That is all I can think of.The biggest issue in my life is \"money\".If I had enough money to pay the bills, meet my ends, and help my family members then I wouldn\'t have to go to work.

'It\'s has been an adjustment working, being a mom, and being in a relationship.  It seems like you never have time to do the things that really matter.  Children really do grow up fast and I just want to really enjoy my child and be there for him.  He has adjusted better than I have to being a working mom.  I know that I will get better at this juggling.I want to be able to provide my child and my family with everything we need and want.  We are not doing bad now, but things could be better.My job is a little stressful at times because I really wasn\'t train well and I learn as I go.  It\'s hard when you work on a deadline and everything must be completely (100\%) accurate.I\'m glad to be working after almost 3 years.  I have financial stability now and independence.  My boyfriend has been and was and still is good to me after being a stay home mom and now a working mom.I was running late for work this morning.  I had to catch the bus.  I hate it (bus). I really need to learn to drive a stick.  That way I could drop him off up north and drive on in.  I know that my boyfriend tries to bring me in as much as possible and I know after working all night sometimes he\'s tired and just doesn\'t feel like driving me in to work and dropping our little boy off.  I really need to learn to drive a stick.This weather has been miserable down here.  I\'m not used to this heat.  My little boy has a cold and allergies. It\'s been so hot that we have to keep the air pumping at a decent temp. To keep the house cool.The summer hasn\'t even begun yet.  I want to start planning activities for the weekends, outside, but its hot already.  Well, we still have time.We need to budget for summer fun.  Theme parks are a little expensive and I just want to be sure that all three of us enjoy whatever activities we engage in.  I can\'t wait for the weekend in to begin.  We have been short staffed again this weekend and it can make you tense when everyone doesn\'t pitch in to make sure everything gets done.I was really upset this morning because my little boy cried most of the morning while preparing to begin our work day.  I know that he was tired because he went to bed late last night.  I ran some errands after work yesterday and I was late getting home, and because of that he was late getting to bed.  He was a little tyrant this morning.  I wanted to baby him yet discipline him for being rude and mean this morning.  He\'s been learning how to use the PC at home and he\'s only three.  I love watching him using the PC.  His punishment for tonight is no computer time.I really want to be a good parent in every way possible, but it\'s hard and his dad and I both make that a priority.It\'s hard with me working during the day and his dad working at night and sometimes weekends.  Overall, he\'s a beautiful child, but when he acts like he did this morning, it makes you wonder if we are doing a good job parenting.

'Today I am very frustrated. The work keeps coming and I still can do it all. I\'m expected to keep up with my work, train new people, take on other\'s work when they\'re out and all with a smile on my face.  I need to learn how to say no.  I\'ve already put in 6 hours from home by Tuesday. They don\'t want me to go over 40 hours, so the only alternative is to go home early on Friday when I\'ve hit the 40 hours. But right before I leave they want a status report.  No, I haven\'t done a damn thing because I\'m busy answering all your stupid questions about what I should be doing instead of actually doing it.  Am I the only one who can see how much logic that process lacks?  Tomorrow is the memorial service for Tim. He was the manager for Street & Bridge until the end of September this year. He left to be the Asstistant Director of the department in Sugarland.  He had a promotion, was moving closer to his family, was about to get re-married and DIED!  At 40 years old he suffers a massive heart attack.  It\'s not like he lived an unhealthy life.  He worked out, went to church, took care of himself.  The week before he left he got pneumonia pretty bad.  I told him he should take it easy. He told me that once he got there and settled in he\'d rest.  Then 14 days after he started his new job, WHAM! Just like that. Scares the hell out me.  Life\'s a flicker.  It\'s those kinds of things that make me realize this work crap isn\'t worth it.  I like what I do but the stress is interfering with my well being. I\'m 7 months pregnant, have gestational diabetes, my friend dies, my brother in law is marrying someone I loathe and the contractor has backed out on the remodeling of our house.  Today I really did want to call in insane (as opposed to sick).  I\'m so far behind at work, at home, at my husband\'s office and with church obligations. I feel as if I\'m doing so many things and none of them well. That is really hard for a perfectionist like me.  I take a lot of pride in the outcome of my work. And if I\'m not able to put thought and creativity into a project, then I don\'t feel satisfied with my work. And if there\'s not satisfaction, I really have to ask myself, what is the point?  All I\'ll have to show for this job 20 years from now is a bunch of pay stubs. They\'ll be nothing that I\'ve built that me and my kids can enjoy.  My husband has been trying to convince me to stay home once our baby is born. I don\'t want to let go of the security of my job. But is it really that secure?  It may be a steady paycheck, but I\'m not sure that should be confused with secure as in peaceful or a sound state of mind.  Right now in my job I\'m miserable, I\'m unfocused and I feel totally under-appreciated.  I\'m sure the late Tim would agree life\'s to short to be unhappy and far too long to live miserably.My friend gave me an article on reducing stress from your life. I\'ve tried to implement some of the article\'s suggestions. Mostly the suggestions about learning to say no and accepting I can\'t do everything myself.  I\'ve said no in some form or fashion 3 times today. Sometimes to flatly decline, sometimes to postpone or delay.  I may be working on the urgent rather than the priority.  It may be time to evaluate what exactly is priority to me. I know God is most important, but the easiest to stray from.  I\'m very bad about not taking the time to honor Him. And when I neglect that part of my life, nothing else seems to go right.  The next most important is my family and my new baby.  It\'s hard to believe that for the last 29 weeks, I haven\'t been alone. I take him everywhere. He hears me and responds to my surroundings. It\'s the most incredible experience.  So his health and well being in of paramount importance to me.  If I\'m stressed and anxious, then it can\'t be doing my son any good.  Another thing that is important to me is a focus on people not product. I believe that may be a source of my recent frustration.  I prefer to take the time with people and their needs rather than concentrate on getting out a product or project at the sake of a deadline.  Everyone\'s project is so critical. Yeah, right. Nobody\'s died because a newsletter was mailed out one day late.  Other people crisis tend to make me lose perspective.  And I\'ve decided, in the final analysis, none of the work that is produced here at the city will mean a hill of beans to anyone.  If I wasn\'t here, they\'d find someone else. Or they wouldn\'t. Not my problem. So it\'s mighty difficult to have loyalty when there ain\'t a chance in hell the loyalty will be reciprocated.I need to go see my aunt this weekend. I\'ve been saying that for 3 weeks. But since I\'ve been diagnosed with diabetes, all my efforts have gone to that issue.  At the beginning of September my Grandfather died. It wasn\'t a surprise.  He\'d been hanging on for far too long.  And at least now he\'s with my Grandmother who died in February of last year.  They were married for 55 years. That is so cool. I hope my husband and I have that kind of success in our marriage. Only 49 more years to go.  My aunt took care of my grandmother before she died.  Then one week after we buried my grandfather, as a family, we\'ve had a horribly traumatic event happen in our lives. It\'s the kind of thing that no one ever imagines could happen to them or anyone else for that matter.  We\'re a long time family in this city and community.  People can\'t believe it\'s happened to us.  It\'s worse than death, desertion or divorce.  And we\'ve been forced to deal with it in a very public way.  The day after it happened, the news media camped out on my aunt\'s doorstep until my cousin and I shooed them to the street at least.  It\'s puts me in such an awkward position because my cousin and I are both media liaisons (her in Dallas and me in Austin) and now we\'re in a position where we are not allowed to comment other than to say the family has no information.  I\'ve thought about seeing a counselor to help me, especially after the trial begins, but I really don\'t trust anyone enough to confide my feelings or details as I see them to anyone but my husband.  So I plod through on my own.I\'m so stressed I feel as if I\'m drowning.  I can\'t keep up with all of the expectations.  Now my supervisor is in the hospital because of her cancer and it doesn\'t seem that anyone up in management sees how we are absolutely losing it in our division.  I\'m the kind of person who takes ownership of problems.  I was told that was good customer service, but 3 times today, I\'ve heard people direct things to me because \"she\'ll know the answer.\"  I\'m looking forward to having this kid just for the break. I honestly don\'t know how long I\'ll be able to maintain this pace.  One should not - cannot - work at this pace indefinitely.  I\'m so wiped out when I leave here there is nothing left over for my family.  THAT will not continue.  The pace exhausts me and then when I get home it takes me 1 to 2 hours to become human again. By that time, it\'s time to get ready for the next day.  Literally half my day (12 hours) is spent at work, going to work, preparing for work or working at home.  If I sleep 8 hours because I\'m very pregnant, that leaves me with 4 hours in a day for being a wife, homemaker, and mommy to be.  That is simply not enough time to devote to such important tasks.  I won\'t live for my job.  And I think I\'m to the point where the job has to be second whatever the consequences or sacrifices.  If I\'m not getting help from management, then I will not be able to meet all of my deadlines or obligations. That\'s just the way it is. My doctor has upped my medication. They don\'t seem too alarmed. The first part of my pregnancy was such a breeze. No morning sickness, not too tired, little weight gain.  Now my doctors have me all over the place. Test, medications, monitoring. Jeeze. My life is consumed by a schedule.  Even on the weekend I never get a rest.We are also in the process of moving.  That\'s pretty stressful, but it\'s fun picking out wallpaper, tile and fixtures.  It lets my creative side go.',3,-5,1,2,1,0,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,2.5,0,0,2.5,0,4.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,3.12,0,0,0,0,1.87,1.25,0,0,1.87,0,0,0,0,12.49,0,1.25,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,26.85,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.5,14.36,0,0,0,0,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.12,Female
'Issues going on in my life right now include preparing for the birth of our second child and trying to get things in order at work prior to my maternity leave.Today is also my anniversary and I am planning on a relaxing dinner with my husband.  Grandma and Grandpa will watch Walker so I won\'t need to worry about him.  He is a great kid but can be a handful at times.  He is really getting to that stage where he is testing his limits and with my raging hormones, some days, he really gets to me.  Some days I just want to send him to another room and not deal with him.  I know this is not fair to him so I take a deep breath and we tackle the situation together.  Usually just explaining things to him and then distracting his attention to another project or toy will get the job done.  Occasionally we have to do the time out thing.  I am getting better at using this technique and since he doesn\'t like being put in time out, he is getting better at behaving.He is really looking forward to the birth of his baby sister.  He can\'t seem to understand why she is not here yet.  He pretends that she is here and plays with her.  He takes his imaginary sister for rides in his toy car and he tries to share things with her.  Sometimes he just talks to her.  I think he will be a great big brother.Since we finally got his new room finished, I am not as stressing about not being ready.  We still need to clean the baby\'s room and get the crib set up, but that should be done by this weekend.  The biggest part for me right now is work.  While I do not normally feel stressed about work, I am feverishly trying to get things in order for my absence.  I know that my backup person does not have much experience administering the systems that I am responsible so I am trying to leave everything in as good a shape as I can get it.  Knowing that things are in order will help me relax while I am at home and hopefully will make life easier for my backup.  The highest priority right now is getting a mission critical system upgraded and getting the additional parts ordered for it.  Also at the same level of priority is getting the cost figures for the replacement machine.  If we can get the replacement machine, it would make my life so much easier.  I would then only have 2 machines to administer instead of the 8 I have now.  Wait, I take that back.  I will have 3 machines since I am inheriting one from another administrator.  However, since this machine will be used to exactly mirror the mission critical system, maintenance should be very low.On top of all this, I am trying to get all my currently assigned calls completed so that I don\'t have to leave work for any one else.  Maybe that is a contributor to stress levels.  I feel like it is my responsibility to get them done and would feel guilty about leaving them for someone else to handle.  However, some of the other employees would have no problems leaving their work for the rest of us.Even though this study may show that I am currently working under a high level of stress, I do not feel it.  In fact, I feel like I perform very well under pressure.  I like the thrill of the hunt so to speak.  It is a challenge to get it all done and I love a good challenge.  Maybe that is why I continually get involved in my work and groups that interest me.  For example - on top of all of the above mentioned tasks, I agreed to co-Chair the Parent\'s Advisory Board at my son\'s day care.  This group is having it\'s first ever garage sale this weekend, we are Planning the Teacher Appreciation Picnic and I am evaluating possible fundraisers for the Fall.  Not to mention the annual Halloween Carnival.  Most of this will need to be decided planned right when my baby is due.  Now what mother in her right mind would volunteer for so much fun!I guess the only thing that is actually bothering me these days is the actual delivery of my baby.  Since I had to have an emergency C-section with my first, we are entering new territory here.  I am not sure what to expect with labor and labor pains.  The fact that I have developed Gestational Diabetes also adds a twist to things.  We are trying for a normal delivery but will have to wait and see.  The doctor has already informed us that she prefers that her diabetes patients not go past term so she may induce labor a week early.  At least that gives a concrete date to have the house ready!  Some days it seems there is not enough time to get it all done but I am sure that everything will work out.  We have a lot of family support and help.  I just hope that Mom and Mark don\'t get in each other\'s way during the delivery.  I don\'t want to hurt Mom\'s feelings but I really only want Mark in the room for the delivery.  Maybe I will deliver in the evening or early morning.  That way Mom can busy herself with watching Walker.  Guess we\'ll just have to wait and see.  They seemed to do okay the last time.  I just need to remind Mom that she can\'t push her way into the nursery like she did with Walker.  It really put a damper on Mark feeling special since he was supposed to be the only one allowed in there.  While I know I need to mention these things to Mom, I also know that no matter how I put it, she will take it the wrong way and get her feelings hurt.All in all though, I think things are going well, and everything will fall into place when I need it to.Today was a relatively easy day.  I did not get as much accomplished as I had hoped.  Well, that\'s not really true.  I got a lot of the little things out of the way but I still have those bigger projects looming on the horizon.  Some of the little things are related to the bigger projects so that helps some.  In quite a few cases however, I am waiting on someone else to do their job so my hands are tied.I hate to keep bugging some of the others involved with the projects, but they keep pushing the deadlines back.  They say they are going to do something on a particular and two days later, I have to call to nag again. Sometimes it\'s just like being their mother.Peggy was having a particularly stressful morning so I made her go to lunch with me, just to get her out of the building.  We had a nice time.  We talked about work some, about home life some and just chit chatted some. We both got each other laughing and that was very helpful.  The afternoon seems to be much more restful today.  The workload does not seem as high this afternoon.  Maybe because we got away from it all for a while or maybe it really has lightened up some.  In any case, it was nice and we weren\'t expecting it to be this quiet.  Especially since ALL of the manager\'s are out and we expected the tech to take advantage of that fact and loaf a little.Home this evening should also work out well.  Mom picked Walker up at day care today since it is her day off.  I have the Parent\'s meeting tonight but I don\'t have to worry about Walker interrupting or crying because he can\'t be with me.  Mark is going straight home so he can paint Eyrin\'s room while Walker and I are out of the house.  He will run over to Mom\'s when he is done and take a swim with Walker and I will pick them both up on my way home from the meeting.  Everything seemed to work out well.Now if we can just get the rest of the house clean AND keep it that way, we should be on our way to smooth sailing.  The only things I still need to do are pack my bag for the hospital and get the bassinet and car seat out of the attic.  The crib is already in the guest room waiting for Eyrin\'s room to get painted and I just need to wash the bedding and the mattress.  I also need to get down some of the baby clothes from when Walker was born.  I guess I should buy a few new outfits also.  Especially an outfit for going home in.  Every baby should get to wear something special to go home!  Guess there is a little more to do than I thought!And on top of all this - I still need to make Walker\'s 4th of July float.  I have an idea in my head on how to make his wagon look like a biplane.  Hopefully it will turn out as good as his rocket did last year.  After all - he is the defending champ in his category.  Next year, I will need to think of a 2 seater float idea!No other real issues going on here.  Everyone is just getting anxious for the baby to be born.  On one hand I am ready for her to be here, but on the other hand am enjoying just being pregnant and feeling her move and kick and boy can she kick.  No one seems to think I will make another 4 1/2 weeks except the doctor.  However, as much as Eyrin has dropped in the last two days, maybe even the doctor will reconsider.  I am looking forward to the time off though.  I love spending time at home with my family.Mark has decided to stay home for 2 weeks instead of just 1.  That will help.  He already knows that Walker will have to go to school when he is not home since I will not be able to watch him, take care of Eyrin.  The extra week home will give us some options with Walker.  He can sleep in, go to school if he wants or stay home and get to know his baby sister.At least Eyrin won\'t be born close to a major holiday like Walker was.  This means we won\'t have the whole family descending on us at one time!.  I still can\'t believe that Crystal sent her family to our house when Walker was just a few weeks old and her kids and husband all had colds!  But then, Crystal does a lot of things I can\'t believe.Our visit with them was typical.  Sergeant Crystal was barking out orders to her husband.  Both had to complain about Mom and Dad and the kids were allowed to do what they wanted.  I did exactly what I said I would do on this trip - Nothing.  I only felt guilty once and only for about 10 minutes.  Well - not exactly true.  I did end up having to watch ALL the kids shortly after our arrival and again the next morning.  Typical Crystal.  Well, I am sure that their social lives are so busy that I don\'t have to worry about them visiting us for a while.',4,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.03,0,0,3.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.03,0,0,0,9.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.02,0,0,0,0,14.23,0,3.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.97,0,0,10.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.07,14.74,0,1.52,0,0,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.06,Female
'Alarm went off @ 4:30 a.m.  Hopped out of bed to take shower & brush teeth (turned coffee pot on before getting in shower).  When through with shower, headed for the coffee pot.(I live in a mobile home-no A/C--so I\'m staying with a friend nearby).A after my friend gets up & dresses for work, he joins me for a quick cup of coffee.  I have 2 cups, he has 1.  I generally head for my house about 5:00 am so he can go to work.  When I get home the first thing I do is put out feed & water for my cats, Then I go inside to ready for work.Unfortunately, it has been so hot recently, I have discontinued putting my make-up on at home & wait until I get to the office.  That way I haven\'t sweated it off before I leave.I usually leave the house by 5:30 am but this week I\'ve been able to leave by 5:20 am.  It\'s dark & no one will see me.  It takes me an hour to drive in.The first thing I did when I got to work was make the coffee on the 3rd floor.  I work on the 2nd floor but we share in the coffee fund.  The coffee was still turned on from Friday.  Someone forgot to turn it off.  Usually all I have to do is rinse out the coffee pat but because it was burned on the bottom I had to scrub it.After making the coffee, I went to the 2nd floor, got my make-up bag but before I went to the bathroom I turned the copier on since there\'s a warming up period.  Went to the bathroom where I proceeded to put my make-up on.  It took about 10 minutes.  Went back to my work area, deposited my bad, turned my lights on, emptied my purse of my cigarette case & Access Card to the bldg.  I keep them on top of my desk.  My purse goes underneath.Then I checked the incoming faxes to see if I could distribute any or do research on any that require my Director\'s attention.  Then I go back to my area & think of what I can do until my co-worker comes in.  I knew the day was going to be hectic as we had to prepare for a meeting that night.I do research on the computer & have to constantly update my information so I decided to spend time doing that until my co-worker comes in.She gets in around 8:15 & brings me an expandable envelope that contains material that has to be copied, hole punched, and stapled, all for that night\'s meeting.  The third floor has a large, fast copier that I was going to try to use.  I took several reams of paper up there. I had to make 75 copies of each document.  Some documents contained 22 or 26 pages.  I made copies in increments of 10 sets so I could let others use the copier so as not to hold their work up.  At one point, I had to go back downstairs & get a case of paper to bring up.  I finished the copies about 11:30.  I did take one smoke break, about 9:30.  When I finished the copies, I had 2 boxes of material to take down to the 2nd floor.  I got a man to carry the heavier box for me.  When I got to Elly\'s office, she was getting ready to go to lunch so I asked her if she would bring back a cheeseburger & fries.  I was starving since I hadn\'t eaten anything yet.I went out for a quick smoke break, came back & started collating the copies on her table.  They still had to be hole punched & some sets stapled.  After getting the copies laid out in the right order, went to my P.C. to edit the minutes from the last meeting.  They still had to be finalized, 75 copies made, hole punched & stapled.  We\'re running short of time.Elly returned with my lunch about 12:50.  I took the time to inhale it, then started back on the minutes.  When I finished them, she asked me to take them to another person and let them copy while I assisted at the table.  Elly is collating finished products, Dana & Veronica are punching holes, I stapled. (My hand is sore today).  So the 4 of us worked together like an assembly line.  Most everything was done by 4:10 PM.  Elly told me to go on home, they would finish the rest.  She didn\'t have to tell me a 2nd time.This is the part of day I dislike the most.  My truck has no a/c & it is hot.  It takes me 45 minutes to get where I am going.  By that time, the back of my shirt is completely soaked, my skirt is also damp.  I stopped at Leon\'s store which is located in our little country community where there\'s about 8 to 10 of us who meet there after work to have a few beers together.  Some play pool, others talk & laugh.  Me, at this point, I\'m trying to cool off.  Before too long however, my damp clothes in the A/C is beginning to make me too cool. But I\'m aware of this, it happens all the time.I probably arrived at Leon\'s about 5:00 & left between 8:00 & 8:30.  It was still daylight.  It takes about 10 more min. to drive home.  The house is almost unbearable but I have a long distance phone call to make.  I probably talked a good hour to my daughter-in-law.  My younger daughter is living with them and they are having problems with her.  I got off the phone about 10:00 PM.  Sweat is literally pouring off me by this time.  Now, during my phone call (I have 2 lines) my friend who I stay with called twice to see if I was coming over.  Told him yes, as soon as I get off the phone. It was probably 10:10 PM by the time I got over there.  He had already gone to bed.  I made sure the coffee had been made for the next morning, then I went to bed.Up @4:20 am today.End of story.When I hand this envelope to you, I already have my purse with me, I will walk out the door to my truck, start it up, (roll the window down first); back out of parking space, drive to Lavaca, make a U-turn at next entrance into parking lot so I can get out on Guadelupe, turn left on E. 1st st. & get caught by the next red light.  When green, I will proceed to Congress, right on Congress, left on Riverside, all the way to Ben White.  By the time I have reached Riverside, however, I will have lit up a cigarette.  When I reach Ben White, I will turn left & go through Del Valle to leave town.  I have been debating today on whether or not to stop & visit a friend in Garfield on my way home.  So to stick with this assignment & write about what I \"will\" do, I just decided to stop in Garfield & visit Bob.  He is my mechanic.  I will stop at a Texaco Station where the turn is to his house, get a 6-pack of beer, drive to his shop, located behind his house.  He is in the process of building a portable paint booth for his shop & I will drop by to see what progress he has made.  Sometimes, other friends stop by after work so we all visit & have a few beers.  I will leave about 6:00 p.m. & drive to Rockne, the community I pass through on the way home & stop at Leon\'s store & visit with them a while.  I will probably leave about 7:30, go home, change clothes, & wait for my friend next door to get home & call me so I can go over there for supper & a cool house.I will check the coffee pot, make coffee for tomorrow.  He will decide what\'s for supper & who will cook it.  After supper, we will watch TV & chat about the day.  If everything I\'ve tried to write in detail happens as I\'ve written, I will probably go to bed about 9:00; if not, then maybe 10:00 but I want an early night, so I will stick to these details as closely as possible.

'One of the things that has bothered me for the last few years has to dowith a woman that used to work for me (and is in one of the departmentswe provide services to).  During the time she reported to me I have tosay was the lowest point in my career with the city.  I have never had aperson that had such highs and lows - one minute she would come in andsay she was the happiest she had ever been and a month later she wouldbe in my office saying she had never been so unhappy.  It all had to dowith (is seemed to me) with whether she was getting her way andwhether the people we had working in the area agreed with her everythought.  Anyone that had another idea or opinion she took an instantdislike to.  The other thing that really bothered me is that once shedecided she didn\'t like you she would spread all kinds of lies about theperson.  She has done it personally to me and to many other people Iknow of.  She also sticks her nose in everyone\'s business under the guiseshe is a union representative.  Even if there was not a problem if shedidn\'t like the supervisor she would push things until the employeethinks there is a problem and never stops at just the truth - the truthto her is very flexible and bends to suit her current agenda.  I wasvery unhappy during those years - one thing that kept me going is someof the friends I had in the department that would remind me often that Iwas not the only one that had had problems with her.  Even though shehas not reported to me for several years now (I worked to get her out ofmy division) she is still saying untrue things about me and others.  Areal problem in my opinion is that the current director of herdepartment thinks she is really good and even though I know many peoplehave told her of the kind of problems she causes (including myself) thedirector does not see it.  To make matters worse this person sellsherself as this caring person looking out for the good of everyone.  Thedirector has put her in charge of morale (it is low in that department,in part, I think, due to this woman). She is the biggest cause of lowmorale in the department!  To give an example of the type of person sheis she recently found out that a certain woman had been promoted into anew job (this job has nothing to do with her!).  She called up the womanand congratulated her on the new job.  A little while later the employeethat has the office right next door to this woman calls the recentlypromoted employee and says you should come down and hear what Elly issaying about you.  She goes down there and Elly is yelling (she doesthis often and to me) at the hiring supervisor as why she promoted thiswoman and she had no business doing that without talking to her etc.She is always talking out of both sides of her mouth!  She blackballed amember of our staff when she worked for me with the entire city - wentto meetings and said really bad things because I think, she realizedthis woman actually had a lot of good ideas, some of which she didn\'tagree with or wanted to take credit for.  I have tried to not thinkabout all the stuff this woman does (and I could go on and on)especially since she does not report to me.  I just don\'t understandwhat makes someone do things like this - why does she feel the need tosay hurtful things about other people.  I am so glad to be out of thatdepartment and only have to be around her on a very limited basis and Iam trying to get over the animosity I feel towards her (although I don\'tthink I have done that good a job) I am still working on it - maybewriting about it will help.  I\'d still rather be anywhere else ratherthan in the same room with her!  Well I guess I vented enough on thissubject and will close for the day.One of the problems that I encounter at work is with working with city procedures and processes that are cumbersome and don\'t make any sense.  I work closely with the HR department and have had major problems over the last year in implementing market and classification studies.  Because processes are not well thought out and procedures are not in place it has been a very difficult and time consuming project.  Then if that is not enough, even when employees receive large increases they are not happy - not fast enough, not enough, not fair etc.  No one is happy even though one of the divisions received increases of 20 to 50\%.  The engineers were especially a problem - increases of 10 to 15 thousand were given in a lot of cases and again all I got was complaining.  Now, since some groups of employees have gotten nice raises all employees think that is what they will get and are very disappointed when that does not happen.  Another of the problems I have is in getting the supervisors and managers to respond to requests for information in a timely way and to be truthful in what employees are actually doing.  It is my opinion in working through this process that most of the supervisors, managers and department heads don\'t really care about what employees are doing and what is a reasonable salary - they only want to give as much money as possible. And don\'t ever look at the bottom line and how that affects their operations.  I find I am caught in the middle of some of this because I feel I need to help maintain the integrity of the classification system but I know that the information being given to me is not an accurate description of what is reality.  I\'m hoping with the hiring of a compensation manager in HRD some of these problems will be fixed and the next round of classification studies will be easier.The other problem I am having at work is with the Y2K process.  We are being judged on how many meetings we attend and how many reports we submit rather that what we are accomplishing.  Spread sheets are handed out at our department head meetings that show who attended what meetings, how many monthly reports have been turned in, it you have this inventory or that - not how good the information is or how many programs we have to test and certify for compliance.  To make matters worse, the director of the IS department wants to take over all the IS people in the departments because she feels she is the only one that knows anything.  Because I have one of the larger IS staff, she focuses in on us on a routine basis.  I believe there are certain things we should as a city consolidate for savings, etc but not everything falls into that category.  She continually tells the city manager that we are not doing what we need to do on Y2K but has yet to talk to us about it and see what we are doing.  I finally set up a meeting with her and her boss to go over our plans and they admitted that we seemed to be on track - but I bet she doesn\'t tell the city manager that!  I feel I have an excellent staff (in a lot of ways better that she has) and we are on track and have accomplished a lot toward meeting our Y2K goals.  We are on schedule and have contingency plans if we are not able to complete our work.  It is very frustrating to feel bad information is being given out but we have no way of countering those accusations.  I\'m hoping when the next report comes out the manager will see that we do indeed know what we are doing.The other thing I am worried about is my youngest sister.  She is going through a divorce right now - something that she probably should have done several years ago.  She has been very unhappy for several years - however she has two elementary age children and I know that it must be very hard to take this step.  I thought she was doing a little better - she actually sounded better than in a couple of years but I got a message this morning from one of my other sisters and she said to call our youngest sister and talk to her because she was really low.  I talked to her - I think it is going to be difficult to juggle the kids between herself and her ex - she feels there is going to be a lot of competition between them - who can take them on the best vacation and so forth.  I think one of her real problems is that she thinks everything needs to be perfect, her marriage (that was why I think she had such a problem letting go), her kids, her house, herself, etc.  She has great kids and wonderful house, a Mercedes, swimming pool, etc but has never been satisfied.  She is always building on to the house, painting, replacing floors, changing the kids rooms, and on and on but never enjoys what she has - there is always something else.  I wish I could help her see what she has and that everything does not nor will ever be perfect and that is OK.  I think I talked her into coming over the 4th - she is not going to have the kids and I know she gets really lonely when they are away.  Hopefully she\'ll come and we can do some fun things!',4,-4,1,2,1,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0,3.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0,1.18,0,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,10.64,0,2.37,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,24.86,0,0,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,3.54,14.22,0,1.18,0,0,1.18,0,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.11,Female
'Yesterday was Monday June 22.  The alarm went off at 5:15 because I normally go walking but I was too tired.  I reset the alarm and slept until 6:30 and got up and took a shower, dressed and went to work.  I wore my black jeans with a beige shirt.  The shirt is very comfortable.  My son was sick so I drove directly to work through Zilker Park.  I did not have to bring him to school because Jose stayed home with him.  The traffic was light and it was a pleasant drive.  I found a good parking space in the garage and rode the elevator up to the 8th floor.  I was even early for a change.  I turned on my computer and checked to see if I had any voice mail messages.  I did not have any but I did have some e-mail.  I checked my To Do list to plan out my day.  I also had to tell my boss that I needed to leave at noon to go home and care for my son so my husband could go to work in the afternoon.I started working on a matrix I needed to get done for some additional resources that were approved.  I was hungry but I did not eat anything.  The bagel lady was not here because she is off on Mondays.  I finished a draft of the matrix and brought it to Kathy for her review.  I worked on some other things in the meantime like filing and organizing the stuff on my desk.I made some more changes to the matrix and packed my briefcase with my budget files in case anyone had questions after I got home.  The morning passed very quickly because I was busy.  I left at around noon and drove straight home.  Once again I drove through the park.  There were quite a few busloads of kids playing on the playscape and picnicking.When I got home, Jose and Joseph had already eaten lunch.  They made a small mess in the kitchen which I cleared.  I ate some leftover Tuna casserole from the other night with a slice of homemade bread.  I cleaned up my mess too.  Jose left for work and Joseph and I watched some cartoons together.  I did a load of laundry and put it away.  I had to run a quick errand so Joseph and I got in the car and went to buy some business software we need for Jose\'s new business.  We will use it to keep track of revenue and expenses.  We also bought a computer game.  The store was not very crowded and we found a good parking place.  We were not there very long.We went home and we were both hot so we had a drink to cool off.  I installed the game and had to reconfigure the joystick.  Joseph was impatient because he wanted to play.  Finally I finished and he played for quite a while.  He likes racing games.  We played for a while and then he went to watch TV because he was tired.  I installed the other software and began to enter some data from January into the program.  Jose came home and we decided to have leftover barbecue for dinner.  After we ate I cleaned up and got the garbage ready because Tuesday is garbage day.  Joseph stayed up for a while but I wanted him in bed early so Jose gave him a bath and put him to bed.  We did not read a book because he was too tired but I brought him his Tinker toys.  He fell asleep very quickly.  After Joe went to bed I made myself a snack of microwave popcorn and cherry Kool  Aid.  I watched 20/20 for a while and then channel surfed.  I watched part of the news but I got caught up in Sophie\'s Choice on one of the channels and stayed up later than I had intended.  I was tired though so I went up to brush my teeth and wash my face.  I dressed for bed and fell asleep around 10:30.',3,-3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.92,0,0,0,0,0,2.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.84,0,0,0,4.38,0,2.92,0,0,8.76,4.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.44,0,0,2.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.46,Female
'5:30 AM the alarm wakes me.  I get up and work out for 1 hr. with an exercise tape.  Jump in the shower.  Get dressed have breakfast & get to work 30 min late.  I start my morning clearing my desk off from Friday.  I do not start seeing customers until 10A.  I did take a break with a coworker at 10:30A.  I had lunch at my desk around 2p.  I brought a sandwich from home.  I saw customers all afternoon.  I left the office at 6p.  My last customer was multiple submittals of commercial plans, so I stayed late to clear off my desk and to return calls.  I stopped on the way home for gas.  The traffic had cleared out a little.  Got home, my husband arrived soon after which was a nice surprise.  We ran an errand to the post office.  Had dinner at home.  Leftovers.  We sat outside earlier and enjoyed the outdoors except the road work going on in the neighborhood.  I talked to my Mom on the phone and also to a friend.  Watched a little TV.  I had a little sorbet before I went to bed.  Fat Free.  We went to bed about 11p.The alarm went off at 5:15AM.  I laid in bed 15 minutes before I got up.  Rolled out of bed and exercised for 1 hour with my exercise video.  Showered, dressed.  I had breakfast on the way to work.  A banana and an apple.  I had to maneuver to get out of my driveway due to the construction on the street.  Got to work at 8AM.  Started seeing customers after I had cleared my desk and phone messages from yesterday.  I took a break with a coworker at mid morning. I went to lunch with a coworker at 12 noon.  We had enchiladas at Good Eats and sat out on their new patio.  Got back to work and a roomful of customers.  Saw customers all afternoon.  At the end of the day I listened to my messages.  Tried to return some calls.  Talked with my husband.  Made the plans for this evening.

'My sister in law and I were best friends all through high school.  She is the one who introduced me to my husband.  She is now married to my husband\'s brother.  Since about 1990, our relationship has deteriorated.  I am very upset about it.  I feel like she is always making rude comments in a joking way.  I wonder sometimes, if those comments aren\'t her true feelings.  I have tried to talk with her several times without success.  I miss my friend and wish our relationship would get better.  I feel like she wants me to be competitive with her and I have been successful in not playing her game.  I\'m not even sure she is aware of what she is doing. She and David have the college degrees to go on the vacations and have the toys.  I am at times jealous, but I am happy they are so successful.  I am proud of my husband and I though.  We have a beautiful home, great jobs, and hopefully a baby within the next 8-10 months.  I don\'t care to have toys or go on cruises.  I love who I am and it hurts me to be looked down upon.  I feel that she is judgmental and I don\'t like it.  I\'m not a judgmental person and I feel that if I were perfect, I would be, but as a human I\'m not.  My mother in law and father-in-law are even another story.  My mom-in-law is great, she would do anything for you, but my father-in-law has made it fairly clear that he doesn\'t like me and makes my husband feel stupid.  I have never confronted him, and pray someday I can understand him and the reason he feels the way he does.  I guess my in-law story doesn\'t differ a whole lot from the rest.   It\'s just a way of life.I really get upset when I\'m at work when my house is a total disaster.  It is very hard to keep up with it all, and I don\'t even have any kids yet.  I can\'t imagine what it will be like then.  I know I will also want to spend more time at home with kids.  I\'m not sure if we will be financially able to let me be a housewife/mother.  I know I need to help bring money in to pay bills, but when my husband also expects me to cook & clean.  We both work 40 hours and he comes home to put his feet up and ask, \"what\'s for dinner?\"  I know he doesn\'t realize what he is doing, but I get angry.  I would like to be able to relax and not have to even think about dinner or if there are clean clothes to wear the next day.  I wish I knew I was at least appreciated more often than I am.  I help with the yard and wish I got a little more help on the house.  Especially when we have children, I will expect even more help.  I do need to be able to come home sometimes and worry about nothing.  Be cared for and pampered.  Even just once every couple of weeks.  I also don\'t appreciate it when my husband comes home with dirty shoes and tracks up a newly clean floor.  It shows a total lack of concern for how hard I\'ve been working.  If he would just be a little more neater about everything, I would be happy.  I hope that talking to him will be a lot better than the nagging I\'ve done.

'My alarm went off at about 5:30. 1 hit the snooze several times. At about 6:00 I finally got up. I played with Emma  my dog  a few minutes than went to find my cat cc she is outside the dog is inside. I fed the cat after playing with her a few minutes. I came back inside, checked Emma\'s food and water, heated up a roll, and ate the roll (sharing with Emma). I\'m on medication that I have to eat before taking.I take my shower, get dressed and than make my lunch. I have a 45 minute ride to work. This morning my ride was uneventful.I get to work at about 7:40, get my cash from the cashier, go upstairs, unlock the door check the Oce engineer copier to make sure it is on, put my cash in the drawer and get to work.Adele shows up about 10 minutes late, puts her cash in her drawer, has to go to the restroom, returns, says she lost her ring, leaves again, comes back several minutes later, makes several phone calls, finally about 9:00 decides to get to work.Adele audits her cash drawer - again when I reconcile the cash it is wrong. I go to lunch downstairs. When I return Adele goes to lunch. When she returns I audit my cash and take the money downstairs.We have a fairly quiet day. We received several site plans to be copied. I finished two of them - the third they added a pages to almost every sheet. I had to return them to the case manager.It\'s time for Adele to go to One Texas Center. It seems to always pick up when one of us are alone.It is time to take my money downstairs. It\'s time for my ride home.When I got home I made supper. It simmered while I watched Wheel of Fortune. I made fresh vegetables from my brother\'s garden. Emma and I ate together she thinks my food is her food. My niece calls to tell me her kittens disappeared last night. I call my sister Audrey I have 4 sisters then call my mom. I feed the cat after playing with her about 20 minutes then get ready for bed. I read a magazine for about 30 minutes than try go to sleep. Emma jumps in the bed - back out - back in I finally put her in the back room and go to sleep.Today I got up at the usual time 6:20. Played with my dog awhile, then checked what I am going to wear to work. Went out and played with the cat a few minutes than fed her.Took my shower - checked on the time - I\'m almost late. I packed my lunch, got dressed quickly and left for work.My drive in was not the best. I had to stop for a school bus loading about 20 kids.When I got to work I stop in at the cashier to pick up our money bags and head up stairs. For once my partner got there before me.The day was slow. I filed several tax maps, did what distribution we had to do, took Environmental\'s plans upstairs and building inspection\'s downstairs. Logged in a preliminary then took the copies where they needed to go.I went to lunch about 1:10. Start to take a short lunch but decide against it because it wasn\'t my fault I had to leave late.When I return, my partner goes to lunch - not right away - says she is going to take a short lunch and again takes more than an hour.When she returns I have to hurry to audit my drawer. I go to OTC for my first analysis.I rush home because someone is supposed to start my deck.My sister calls when I get home to tell me my nephew has an all star game. I heat up some leftovers and Emma and I share my supper. Emma thinks she is a person.I go to the game, it turned out to be a good one. My nephew\'s team wins.I stop at the store on my way back home to get cokes for my ride in the morning. I come home, play with Emma and CC a while then get ready for bed. Emma\'s eye looks funny like the cat scratched it. Her eyes always scare me. She always seems to have problems with them.I read a magazine a few minutes and go to bed.I can\'t wait to get out of work. My deck was supposed to be started today.At the end of the day I get six customers - it always happens when I have something to do after work.I plan to go home and make spaghetti for supper for the guys. I\'m anxious to see.I hope CC is not being a nuisance; she really can be. If she is today I\'ll have to lock her up somewhere tomorrow, maybe in the restroom.I imagine Emma is having a fit, hearing people outside and she doesn\'t know who is out there. Silly thing won\'t bark just runs around nervously.Even though I\'m anxious about my deck I hope they don\'t stay too long - I\'d like to go to bed early tonight.',3,-4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,13.42,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.49,0,0,4.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,10.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.12,Female
'The first issue that came to mind was my home life.  At the current moment, my husband and I are working on adopting a baby.  We are very excited and anxious to begin a family.  We are hoping that within a couple of years that I can stay home with our children.   The most difficult part of the adoption process is the wait.  I am trying to be patient about it, but as badly as I want a baby it is difficult.  I don\'t even really mind all the questions and medical tests that we have had to undergo.   It will be worth it in the end.Having a child is something I have thought about since I was very young, and when I was told at age 12 that I couldn\'t have my own, It was devastating.  I know that\'s a young age to be upset about it, but as a child I would much rather help my mom with the kids she watched than play outside.My husband was so caring and understanding when I told him I couldn\'t have children.  We were only dating at the time, but we were very serious.  He had been very supportive and tries to understand my feelings the best that he can.  Our families are excited for us also.We bought a house two years ago in anticipation of beginning our family.  I can\'t wait to decorate the baby\'s room.  I have a theme picked out and my mother is anxious to help.The stress of the whole process is not quite so bad because we have a close friend in the exact same situation.  Being able to talk to them about it and knowing they understand helps.  All of our other friends and family do their best to understand, but I don\'t feel they can completely.My sister in law and I were best friends all through high school.

I feel like she is always making rude comments in a joking way.  I wonder sometimes, if those comments aren\'t her true feelings.  I have tried to talk with her several times without success.  I miss my friend and wish our relationship would get better.  I feel like she wants me to be competitive with her and I have been successful in not playing her game.  I\'m not even sure she is aware of what she is doing. She and David have the college degrees to go on the vacations and have the toys.  I am at times jealous, but I am happy they are so successful.  I am proud of my husband and I though.  We have a beautiful home, great jobs, and hopefully a baby within the next 8 10 months.  I don\'t care to have toys or go on cruises.  I love who I am and it hurts me to be looked down upon.  I feel that she is judgmental and I don\'t like it.  I\'m not a judgmental person and I feel that if I were perfect, I would be, but as a human I\'m not.  My mother in law and father in law are even another story.  My mom in law is great, she would do anything for you, but my father in law has made it fairly clear that he doesn\'t like me and makes my husband feel stupid.  I have never confronted him, and pray someday I can understand him and the reason he feels the way he does.  I guess my in law story doesn\'t differ a whole lot from the rest.   It\'s just a way of life.I really get upset when I\'m at work when my house is a total disaster.  It is very hard to keep up with it all, and I don\'t even have any kids yet.  I can\'t imagine what it will be like then.  I know I will also want to spend more time at home with kids.  I\'m not sure if we will be financially able to let me be a housewife mother.  I know I need to help bring money in to pay bills, but when my husband also expects me to cook and clean.  We both work 40 hours and he comes home to put his feet up and ask, what\'s for dinner?  I know he doesn\'t realize what he is doing, but I get angry.  I would like to be able to relax and not have to even think about dinner or if there are clean clothes to wear the next day.  I wish I knew I was at least appreciated more often than I am.  I help with the yard and wish I got a little more help on the house.  Especially when we have children, I will expect even more help.  I do need to be able to come home sometimes and worry about nothing.  Be cared for and pampered.  Even just once every couple of weeks.  I also don\'t appreciate it when my husband comes home with dirty shoes and tracks up a newly clean floor.  It shows a total lack of concern for how hard I\'ve been working.  If he would just be a little more neater about everything, I would be happy.  I hope that talking to him will be a lot better than the nagging I\'ve done.

'Because I work in the field of Purchasing, there is a cyclical nature to the workload. It\'s related to how soon the fiscal year will be over, and it\'s related to unexplained giant lumps of work that appear out of no where. I come from the private sector, where, for seven years, I worked my heart out for a high tech start up company. Then they dumped me. damned politics are and will always be a mystery to me. When I came to work at the City, the workload they gave me was laughable. I could do it with both legs and arms tied behind my back. But once I got over the adrenaline withdrawal, the work began to interest me. I could use my creative juices to write specifications for services that have never before been done. Austin used to be leading edge in its environmental and conservation services. So it has been kind of fun. However, there are people in other departments with whom I have to work, who are terrible. They have no integrity, no esprit de Corp, no work ethic, and in some cases, no brains, well, certainly no common sense. I prefer a work environment in which everyone tries to help each other to a common end. That is missing from most of the City in general from what I can see been here 5 years. It is also missing from ISS. There is no self identity as a department. No one in the City Manager\'s Office asked us for input into this revolutionary concept. No one in the CM office was able to give us any direction as we struggled to set up a centralized administrative system. Once the deed was done, there has been little if no support from upper management in ISS. They are too busy being spin doctors trying to get the directors of the four member departments to love us. They do not support their people. But I live with it, or can go on out and find another job.I believe that people stress themselves out, or allow themselves to be stressed out, not that people stress us out. Easy to say, but I can fairly live by this credo. It is especially easy, because I am physically removed from the core of ISS, being located in another building. So job stress to me is relatively low. It can get hectic. now I do the job that previous to ISS, 2 1/2 people used to do, but I can leave the job at the door when I go home.Home, over the last couple of months has been another matter altogether. I do not feel real comfortable talking about it, here, but will try. My husband of 11 years is the kindest, sweetest, most filled with integrity man I have ever met. My husband is also an alcoholic. After 8 or 9 years of mostly not drinking, he ran into a magazine article about controlled drinking. may that article rot in hell. The theory is that an alcoholic can control his her drinking by setting a daily limit. not subscribed to by USA\'s AA. I saw it as a slippery slope, compounded by other personal family factors. His drinking got worse, he became remote, etc and I intervened. Divorce was mentioned by him, and things got real bad. I cried for days. I attended as many Al Anon meetings as I could. I talked to anyone with experience in AA or Al Anon. And I fought like hell to keep him from throwing the towel on our marriage. I reasoned if I could be around him, I would be there when the miracle happened and he stopped denying his addiction. Work was tough for the last couple of weeks, because I was so torn up. Mighty stress from home DEFINITELY impacts work performance. Anyway, on Sunday, he confessed to me that he was an alcoholic, and was going to go to AA or rehab if necessary. I didn\'t expect the miracle so soon.I have, at the recommendation of Al Anon, been journaling already. I have already written most of the stuff above. Writing is a good purge. Hope I don\'t skew your results.My husband is committed to going to Alcoholics Anonymous, but is angry about it. Not about going, but about having to go, having to be there, being an alcoholic. Reticent as he is, he told me last night that he is angry about this. On the one hand, this is real good: anger is a stage of grief, this time over the loss of his denial and the easy way out. On the other hand, I worry about him. I know I can\'t fix him, but I would like to see it go as smoothly as possible. I tried to tell Mark about how, even though I don\'t believe in a god per se, I had for the first time in 25 years (during his denial and recent request for a separation) been able to just let whatever it is up there, take things out of my hands and off my mind, because I just couldn\'t handle it by myself anymore. I thought that maybe it might help reduce the stress he is putting himself under.So I go on my merry way, concentrating on myself, ending years of isolation due to my own medically inspired emotional illness, another story altogether, and recently solved. I\'m having a gas with self esteem. It\'s good to know I can like myself, and do good things for myself.But, I feel his stress. And while I try hard not to be sucked into it, it is impossible to ignore. I love him too much. And this stress has been brought to my work place. I could feel myself with a shorter temper today. Me, I\'m the one who says, What can I do to make your life better? to all my customers. Today, I wasn\'t ugly or anything, but maybe abrupt.And I spent the better part of the morning in a meeting. Attending meetings are always a source of stress for me, if I let them. Even well run meetings. I resent the time that could have been spent trying to bring my office a little closer to completely organized. I plan on bailing out of this job sometime in the near future, and don\'t want to leave a mess for my successor.I wish I didn\'t have to work for a living. I wish I could indulge my hobbies of photography, writing, and music. I guess I resent my job for being a job. It wouldn\'t matter if it were the best job in the world (i.e. one that really turned me on.) The thrill here is gone here. I\'ve made some good friends, and have gotten tired of the whiners. And I\'ve learned a lot about the craft of specification writing, the precision of making absolutely sure we get what we need, not what we ask for. The precision of detail. I would rather write with more freedom. I would rather experience the world outside of this damn cubicle with no view of the outside.There are a billion things that can cause stress. But first, you must allow them to get to you. My lifelong lesson will be learning how not to get stressed.Sorry this is so disjointed. It was a strange day, with lots of interruptions and crabby people. And I\'m fretting about my husband. Guess I better go to Al Anon. See you.Any stresses that I may have had at work, have been pretty much eased, having just received my first paycheck with my new, and long anticipated, raise (from the market survey, and grandfathered back to March 1st). I know I can earn more money in the private sector, but this raise goes a good way towards resolving that inequity. Feeling valued, monetarily, for my job helps me feel good about myself, and this in turn helps me stay serene. Serenity helps me resist the temptation to sink into stress. Also PECS has given me a several awards over the last year, thanking me for being of help to its employees. I don\'t know why recognition as a valued employee should be so important, besides the obvious. I guess a lot of people (myself included) have a problem with low self-esteem.I went to Al Anon again last night. Heard a bunch of stories. While my husband has not yet had to \"hit bottom\", hearing about others that have makes me nervous. I wonder, will Mark find his resolve crumbling. He went for a drive last night. He says that driving helps him to think. I believe that he did not go anywhere to drink. I know that he is working through some serious demons inside himself. For the hundredth time, I remind myself that I cannot fix him, and cannot help him do what only he can do. I just keep practicing letting my fears go up to \"the higher power\" (why do they insist on referring to the higher power as a \"he\"). Mostly, I try to recapture the feelings I had after college when I climbed around in mountains out East for several months. Whatever works.My goal for the long term future is to continue to take care of myself first, including being kind to myself, doing nice things for myself, continuing to learn about myself and the world around me. Sounds trite. In fact, listening to myself over the past couple of weeks, I\'ve heard cliché after cliché. I\'m thankful that I am rising to the occasion of the upset my husband\'s alcoholism has brought into our marriage, and into my life.

'5:30 AM the alarm wakes me.  I get up and work out for 1 hr. with an exercise tape.  Jump in the shower.  Get dressed have breakfast & get to work 30 min late.  I start my morning clearing my desk off from Friday.  I do not start seeing customers until 10A.  I did take a break w/a coworker at 10:30A.  I had lunch at my desk around 2 p.  I brought a sandwich from home.  I saw customers all afternoon.  I left the office at 6 p.  My last customer was multiple submittals of commercial plans, so I stayed late to clear off my desk and to return calls.  I stopped on the way home for gas.  The traffic had cleared out a little.  Got home, my husband arrived soon after which was a nice surprise.  We ran an errand to the post office.  Had dinner at home.  Leftovers.  We sat outside earlier and enjoyed the outdoors except the road work going on in the neighborhood.  I talked to my Mom on the phone & also to a friend.  Watched a little T.V.  I had a little sorbet before I went to bed.  Fat Free.  We went to bed about 11p.The alarm went off at 5:15AM.  I laid in bed 15 min. before I got up.  Rolled out of bed & exercised for 1 hour with my exercise video.  Showered, dressed.  I had breakfast on the way to work.  A banana & an apple.  I had to maneuver to get out of my driveway due to the construction on the street.  Got to work at 8A.  Started seeing customers after I had cleared my desk and phone messages from yesterday.  I took a break with a coworker at mid morning. I went to lunch with a coworker at 12 noon.  We had enchiladas at Good Eats & sat out on their new patio.  Got back to work & a roomful of customers.  Saw customers all afternoon.  At the end of the day I listened to my messages.  Tried to return some calls.  Talked with my husband.  Made the plans for this evening.

'The most stressful part of my life at this time is my husband.  Three months ago he was working and had a bolt fly up and hit his eye.  There was extreme trauma to the eye.  He was off work for 1 month then went back light duty.  He has since had surgery on his eye (still can not see) and has not yet returned to work.  All of the above was stressful, however, dealing with his emotional ups and downs is the worst part.  One minute he is fine and does what he wants, the next he is depressed, feels like a freak and keeps going to bed.  I know he has been through a lot and I know he has headaches.  However, I get very frustrated and very stressed trying to keep his spirits up.  When Burt is in the dumps, I seem to get angry and lose patience which then makes me mad at myself for not being more understanding.  This just seems to go in a circle.  Except for this accident Bert and I have a great life.  Yes we both work hard, but that\'s what life is about.One year ago if I was writing this I would have been writing about all the bad things that went on at work.  I have since changed positions and my stress comes because of my own expectations of myself.  I take pride in what I do and can not be satisfied with just getting by.  I feel that my present position is due to this attitude.  Thank goodness for the change or I would probably have left employment with the City.  The most stressful part of my work is my commute in.  We live 50 miles from here.  The drive can be bad.  When Bert is working we carpool in together.  This works out great for us and makes the 50 miles each way more bearable.I had to attend my daughter- in-laws grandmothers\' funeral today.  She was only 69 and seems so young to have left us.I keep thinking about your handout that I might feel sad after writing.  Even though I have The usual stress I feel my life has been so blessed.  God gives me the strength to get through each incident that occurs.  I have been trying to turn issues over to him rather than me carrying the burden, this seems to be the best stress relief I can have.Time is up.  Did I ramble or what.My husband and myself have been married 27 years.  We have worked very hard to stay out of debt.  Of course to have anything must occasionally have a payment. We spent 1 year building our home.  We lacked approximately $5000 having enough money to finish the house.  WE decided it would cost less to get low interest or no interest credit card.  This would be less interest than getting a loan.  It is driving me crazy trying to get this paid off.  There just always seems to be other things to put the money toward.  I know that for most people this is a small sum, but for me it\'s a royal pain in the rear end.  The only thing that I can relate to my childhood is my work ethics and my desire not to owe money.  We grew up knowing what was expected of us, what we were expected to do, and that we were loved.  All of this from my Mom and very little from my Dad.  I would not have failed my mom for anything.  Today this carries over in that when I have a responsibility, I feel it must be taken care of as soon as possible.  This in turn causes stress that I put on myself.If I do not complete things within the timeframe I set I work on it all night in my sleep.  This can then put me in a circle.  Too tired to work: can\'t finish projects, then can\'t sleep.  What a rat race I cause myself.  I\'ve run out of things to write.  Will wait until next assignment.Day, 1, Day 2, Day 3 same assignment.  I\'m very disappointed.  We were told subjects would be assigned.  This is not a subject, therefore this caused stress.My suggestion, Day 1 - stress in the workplace - Day 2 stress at home. Day 3 - stress in relationships.  This would have made putting a clearer thought process together.  These are the types of assignments that I dislike, just too generic.My boss is going on vacation.  I have several assignments to do while she is gone.  Because of my personality I am feeling really stressed that I won\'t finish everything.  On top of everything else, I will be in computer class 2 days.  So much of what I do has legal implications and I can\'t make mistakes.  Even though I\'m stressed over getting everything done I really like my job.  I feel very suited for what I do.Different subject.  Bert went back to the doctor today.  He is finally beginning to see a little.  This is such good news.  Now if the headaches will go away maybe we can get back to our normal life.  Eric, my son, is testing for one of the local fire dept. Saturday.  I am praying he gets the position.  He has put in a lot hours; and we sacrificed a lot so he could train.  Perhaps my prayers will be answered.Before finishing up, my real frustration is that employees in our department & others get paid large salaries & do no work.  Why some get by and nothing is done just amazes me.  Good employees end up leaving or are forced out because bad employees are never dealt with.',4,-4,0,2,1,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.05,2.1,0,2.1,0,4.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.15,0,2.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.05,0,0,0,0,13.65,0,0,0,0,2.1,0,0,0,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.2,7.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female
'Today has been a very stress-free day with only routine moderate stress deriving from work.  Juggling my work and family life continues to be a challenge.  Juggling my work schedule to meet Katherine\'s day camp activities has presented a challenge for me because of the times she starts ends camp are not consistent with my work schedule.  I came into work today at around 6:30am, left at 8:20am to pick her up, returned at 9:05am & left again at 11:45 to pick her up.  Although I typically and routinely work more than 40 hours per week, I feel guilty that I am not able to work more than 40 hrs. and not spend more time at work.  During the school year I get pressure from my husband to be home at 3:30 or 4:00pm by working through my lunch break.  He feels that I need to be at home with Katherine.  Although I enjoy my time With Katherine, I feel I am neglecting my job and am not fulfilling my role as a manager.  My husband does not seem to understand and or does not accept my responsibilities in this position.  I feel he has placed this huge burden on me and that I feel I have to live up to his expectations.  I love and enjoy my job and have only 3 years to go before I can retire.   I feel that we can have someone watch Katherine for 2 - 3 hours after school without a problem.  My husband feels we should be the ones take care of Katherine and not other people.  He works in San Antonio & commutes back & forth everyday so its difficult for him to be home any earlier than 6:00pm.  Katherine has no problem with having a sitter.I also feel guilty with not being able to be at home when Katherine gets home.  we have fun together and can do special things.  However, Katherine can sometimes be difficult as she gets bossy, temperamental, and gets upset easily with any little thing.  I don\'t know why she gets this way.  I sometimes feel that it could be me or her dad causing her to behave in this manner.  I then feel guilty because we don\'t spend much time during the week just having fun, talking, or just being together.  I\'m hoping its just a 10 year old\'s phase & that it will go away.  Another thing that bothers me about K\'s behavior attitude is her negativity.  She seems to contradict anything I or anyone says to her.  She does not say anything positive or kind when she is in this mood.  I don\'t think that I or my husband project such an attitude.  We in fact point out what she said, why it isn\'t nice, and what and how we expect her to behave or respond.  Katherine is not your typical loving, touchy - feely kind of girl,  She is very independent, speaks her mind, and does not readily follow the crowd.  She is indeed very spirited, smart, and self confident. I don\'t want to stifle these qualities because she is what I wasn\'t when I was 10 - 20 - 30 years.  I want her to reach her full potential and not settle for the status quo.I love Katherine, husband, and family tremendously, and unconditionally.  I want to complete my 25 years with the COA and& then enjoy being a mom doing all the motherly things I did not have the opportunity to do before.I lost my father and mother when they were in the prime of their lives.   My father died at age 47 and my mother died at age 54.  As I approached age 47 I became concerned about my heart since my dad died of a heart attack.  I was examined by a cardiovascular doctor and was relieved that I was A OK.  I am now 50 and am approaching the age my mother passed away.  Once again I\'m concerned that I may too die at a young age and leave my daughter without a mother.  I continue to get  regular check ups, lost weight and exercise.  I was diagnosed with borderline high blood pressure this year so I\'ve been diligently doing the things I need to do to lower my blood pressure without medication.  Although I have kept my blood pressure at a normal rate - I fear that I will die suddenly without warning as both my parents died.  I fear of what will happen to my 10 year old daughter and what will become of the family, my sons and grandchild.  My sons were devastated at the loss of their grandmother (my mother) as she was a very important part of their everyday lives.  I worry about whether their step-dad will try to keep the family together or will he totally ignore their existence?  will he move to California or elsewhere and take my daughter away from her brothers and family?  Will he remarry and will his new wife accept and love my daughter as her own?  There are so many thoughts and possibilities of what might or might not happen.   I do not dwell on all these thoughts as I have no control of the future.  As my husband is 8 years younger than me - I wonder how the age gap will affect our marriage, our sex life, etc especially as we both, especially me, are getting older.  The age gap has not negatively affected any aspect of our marriage and I hope it never will.  I see a lot of couples getting divorced or having affairs because of a variety of reasons.  Will my husband get the mid life crisis and mess around?  Will he no longer be attracted to me emotionally and physically?  I have not seen any signs that this is happening now and I hope that I never experience this problem.  My deepest desire is to nourish a strong family life which includes my son, daughter and grandson. and that my husband is also receptive and an integral part of the family and that he becomes a loving and accepting part of this family.  I am hoping that this will happen as I have seen my husband making an effort to be a caring parent to my sons and grandson.  He loves our grandson and has no problems showing it.  We just need to work at spending more time together as a family - this has been difficult because of our busy lives - ours and my sons.With all the demands placed on me by my family, my job, & myself, I get very focused on getting the job done, the task accomplished, & getting a lot of things done to make my use of  time more efficient.  With all this stress--some self-imposed, I have no time to develop or nurture friendships & relationships with my immediate & extended family.  I have no time to pick up the phone & chat with a friend or relative or spend time doing something or visiting friends relatives.  There are so many things to accomplish each day that I only make time to sleep.  I would again like to be the person I was many years ago--finding making time to have FUN! FUN! FUN!  I find that my time is valuable so I swamp myself with things I need to do - none of which is FUN!  Even the time I spend with my daughter is focused on getting something accomplished & not just enjoying each other\'s company or having FUN!  Going to piano, going to camp, going to the movies all limit the time we can interact.  Before, I would constantly have friends & family gathering in my home; I was constantly doing things and having fun with my family and friends.  Now having a gathering at home means work & I\'m not willing & too tired to do it.  It did not seem like work in the past--why do I feel this way now?  I think that I spend all week working hard & running around that I have no energy left to do anything on the weekends.  I have made some effort to have family and friends over but it resulted in more stress for me.  I need to explore alternatives which will not generate stress for me but still accomplish having FUN with my family & friends.',4,-5,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.01,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.18,0,0,0,0,1.46,0,0.73,0,0,0,7.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.47,0,4.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.22,0,0,7.28,0,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.73,24.75,0,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.09,Female
'Yesterday was Sunday so I slept in until 8:00.  My mother came home sothen I got up and put on biscuits to eat and made cereal for my son.  Ifed my son his cereal while the biscuits were cooking, and then I ate my biscuits with butter and grape jelly.  While I ate breakfast Iread the morning paper.  after breakfast I took a shower and bathed myson, Adrian.    Adrian likes to take bathes and splash around so hestayed in for about 10 minutes.  I then made rice and broccoli casseroleand fruit salad to take over to my Dad\'s house for our father\'s daymeal.  I got Adrian\'s bottles ready  and filled his diaper bag with allthe necessities like diapers, wipes, spoon, cup,  and toys.  Aftereverything was together,  I put Adrian in the car with the food and mybrother and we went to Dad\'s house about 20 minutes away.  In the car welistened to my brother\'s rap music and Adrian fell asleep.  We got to mydad\'s house and hung out in the living room and watched TV while my dadfixed steaks.  My dad was in and out of the house barbecuing and playingwith Adrian.  I made tea and put together a booster chair that I had boughtfor Adrian but had never used.    We ate about 3:00 and then I cleanedthe kitchen and watched The Godfather II on USA Today.  At about 4:30 weleft and on the way home dropped off some videos that I had rented onSaturday night,  and stopped at the grocery store to buy some luncheonmeat and bread.  When we got home I straightened up the house andwatched TV.  I also then painted my nails.  I watched the movie about thedione quintuplets.  After the movie was over I went to sleep.This morning I got up around 6:00 and got in the shower.  I did mynormal morning routine of brushing my teeth,  blow dried my hair,  putmy hair in rollers, and put on my make-up.  This usually takes about 45minutes.  I then put on my clothes that I was wearing to work.  My sonwoke up around 6:30.  I put him on the floor beside me and he playedwith my brush while I put on my make-up.  After I was dressed I changedhis diaper and cleaned his face with a washcloth.  I woke up my cousinwho is staying with us for the summer and watching  Adrian while I am atwork.  While she played with him I went downstairs and made his cerealand made his bottles for the day.  I took his cereal and one bottleupstairs to him and left to go to work.  My drive to work takes me about20 minutes.  I drive through Round Rock and then get on IH 35.  When Igot to work I put my stuff in the drawer and made some oatmeal.  I atemy oatmeal while I did the morning deposits.   I did my work throughoutthe day and talked to the receptionist.At about 11:00 I went to lunch at Wendy\'s.  I had a spicy chickencombination.  I only took a 30 minute lunch because I left work early today. When I got back to work,  I worked on a form I was transferring to excel, and had a few customers to help.  At2:15 I left work and went to take a test for another job.  The teststarted at 3:00 and lasted until 4:30.There were several sections and each section was timed.  When the testwas over I went to look at a couple of daycare facilities.  I found onethat I like but it is so expensive.  I stopped at sonic on the way home and picked up dinner for my cousinand me.   We both ate hamburgers with French fries.  I ate and fed mybaby dinner when I finally got home at 7:00.  I was very tired so I laidon the sofa for a while and wanted to go to sleep.  I got up and cleanedthe kitchen and mopped the kitchen.  I went back upstairs and put thebaby to sleep and then washed his dirty clothes.  About then is when Iwrote this letter.',3,-3,0.5,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4,0,0,0,0,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.4,1.4,0,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Female
'The alarm went off at 5 dark 30.  I hit the snooze alarm 2 or 3 times maybe more.  My other half had already taken his shower and no I had to decide whether to get up and go to work or not.  Ten minutes later I jumped into the shower.  Standing in the closet picking out what mood of clothes to wear.  Stern, playful, powerful.  The weather will be hot.  I made a mental note to ask about water jugs for the inspectors.  I wondered if Residential could get along another month like this, short handed and hot weather.  Went downstairs and ignored the pile of clean laundry in the couch needing to be folded.  Got the girls up.  They were so happy.  They wanted to stay home with me or call grandpa.  They were so tired.  Started them on breakfast while I made lunches and discussed their upcoming day and plans to go shopping that evening for Father\'s day presents.

'Central issues in my life:1. My relationship w/ X.  Reconciling after a 7 month separation is not going to be easy.  I am waking up with a feeling of anxiety that I\'m making a huge mistake by going back, but I can always move out again so I\'ll make like Scarlett & think about that tomorrow.  For now, he\'s being very good & behaving himself.  The real test will be after I move back home.2. My relationship w/ Y.  I need to call him tomorrow & let him know of my decision.  He is not going to be happy.  He had previously told me it would be a big mistake to move back.  He has been so patient with me, I\'m really going to feel bad about telling him.  I wonder how he will react.  I can\'t procrastinate--i must tell him tomorrow!3. My relationship w/ Z.  What to do, what to do!?  I keep vacillating between staying w/him & cutting him off.  The most difficult decision I have!  Why?  Why?  Why?$.  My relationship w/ my son. --He can be so wonderful yet so aggravating in the next minute.  I love him so much yet it is good that we can maintain a certain distance so we can really enjoy each other when we\'re together.  Why are the biggest frustrations in my life all men?5.  My relationship w/ my mother.  She is getting old and sick.  I wish I could do more for her.  I feel frustrated because I can\'t help her more.  Thank God she has my sisters and brother to help her.  I don\'t know what I would do if she were depending solely on me.  I don\'t think I could handle it.6. My relationship with my siblings.  L.  wants to borrow money.  I feel strange about this but I have to help her if I can.  N. is stable &so is G. --Thank God.  My mother was blessed with exceptional children.  L. will be okay once she recovers from this setback. Work:  this is my escape.  Although things are hectic--too much work & not enough staff--I can still cope.  I have always had stressful jobs so this is nothing new to me.  No matter what is thrown at me I always feel like its something I can handle.  A & K have been very good to me & very supportive--totally different from just a few years ago when I was ready to walk out of this place.  What a difference people make.  My staff is all so conscientious & hard working.  I am lucky to have such a great team of people to work with.Another stress factor--my house.  It\'s a wreck.  I really have neglected it.  I have a lot of work before me.  Do I look forward to fixing it up or am I going to have a fit because it will be too much for me.  We\'ll see.Enough!My greatest conflict is dealing with my personal relationships.  I always seem to feel like I am not totally in control of my life.  Someone else is always goring me into decisions that are not really my choice.  Or maybe I  let others influence my decisions too easily.  I wish I could be stronger.  I think this stems from my childhood, my upbringing.  My mother has always had a very strong opinion about everything & doesn\'t hesitate to tell it to everyone especially her children.  I\'ve seen her alienate all of us at different times of our lives but we all forgive & forget & just accept this as the way she is.  I know I have made decisions based on her influence that I wish I hadn\'t made.  And then turned around & did something totally opposite to spite her only to regret it myself.  We do really stupid things when we\'re young.  Fortunately most of us are permanently scared by any of this.  We all turned out okay.  None of us are axe murderers or total basket cases.  Doesn\'t everyone suffer through quirks from Mom and Dad.  X\'s children were in town last weekend.  They told the funniest stories about \"Dad\".  I\'m sure at the time they were traumatic but now we can just laugh & make fun of each other.  Is this our way of dealing with the stress of growing up & acting the way we do now?  Who knows.I am a very private person.  The very idea of writing my deepest feelings is not natural to me.  There is only one person that I have ever really confided in & she is not around right now so I\'ll just keep everything locked inside of me.  That\'s the way I\'ve always done it.  It amazes me how some people can disclose every aspect of their lives.  I can\'t.X is upset at me.  I was out late last night saying goodbye to Z.  It was very pleasant, very sweet but it is a final goodbye.  One stress off my plate.I had lunch with Y today.  Told him also of my plans.  Also very sweet to me, saying he understood.  How did I get so lucky finding someone so sweet and patient.  But it was a major stress in my life because I knew he wasn\'t the one & I didn\'t like stringing him along.  He wants us to stay friends.  That\'s okay by me.Wow, in the last 24 hrs.  I have gotten rid of 2 major stresses in my life.  I feel relieved.  I wonder if my blood pressure will go down.  I still have to deal w/X.  He is probably my #1 stress, so why am I going back to him?I must really be a glutton for punishment.  My son came by.  I hadn\'t talked to him in a few days--he was angry w/ me but I knew he would cool off and call me.  He is stress #4.  Isn\'t it funny that I have all my stress factors numbered?  Anyway, I can never get rid of him so all I can do is be patient with him & hope we maintain out good relationship.Work was so hectic today.  I hardly had time to think about how sad I really was about ending it w/ Z.  He came by late in day just to visit.  How nice.  I am glad I am able to maintain a relationship w/ him & we can still be friends & talk about things just like we always have.  I\'m going to like this.  Same w/ Y.  I feel good so I guess that\'s it.',4,-4,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1.81,0,1.81,0,1.81,0,0,5.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.72,0,3.63,0,0,0,0,5.44,1.81,0,1.81,1.81,0,0,0,1.82,0,0,0,0.91,0,0,0.91,0,24.47,0,1.81,0,0,1.81,0,0,0,37.16,0,0,3.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.88,12.69,0,1.81,0,0,1.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.63,0,0,5.44,Female
'I am writing this at home at 10:45pm.   Worked until 10:15, had to walk the dog and felt it would be best to get home before I did my writing.  What\'s up at work?  Budget deadlines.  Should be over tomorrow.  My assignment is to study deep issues and feelings.  Over the past week or so I have written several cathartic pieces.  But today I don\'t really feel like it.  Either I have just set aside feelings in order to be able to do my work more effectively or I have addressed a number of issues lately and feel somewhat at peace and in alignment.  Sometimes you can do only so much emotional work before you are rewarded with a brief respite.  Work.  Deep feelings.  I am actually enjoying it right now.  That could change at any moment.  Maybe work seems good because my personal life has such holes in it.  I learned early from my Dad that sacrificing for a job is all important.  That coupled with my strong desire not to have an ordinary suburban life has led me to where I am today.  Well I\'m sure those aren\'t the only things but maybe the only ones I want to touch on right now.  How did I end up this age & without a family.  Fear?  Confusion?  Stubbornness.  Any number of traits and beliefs got me here.  How to get out?  Just recently I took a trip with a dear friend.  Being with him for an extended period reminded me of how much I really like sharing my life with a man.  And for the first time in years, well maybe even ever I felt like opening up and sharing.  Mind you I didn\'t say being totally vulnerable, still some resistance there.  It was a good feeling, fun, light happy.  Of course upon return I had built a set of expectations revolving around control of the relationship that didn\'t pan out at all.  As a result I have spent some miserable days not getting exactly what I wanted.  In a way it was a waste of time my arm is getting tired. but I learned some valuable lessons.  Perhaps this time it will be about acceptance and unconditional love or at least about recognizing what my wants and needs are and moving on if the two are not compatible.  Imagine doing that instead of wallowing in unfulfilled desires and self pity.  And I had become such an expert at that.  Who do I want to be and how does work mesh with that.  Well the two have never quite meshed.  I\'m in the wrong profession.  Don\'t get me wrong I\'m good at what I do and I have fun at it at least some of the time.  But bottom line, if money wasn\'t an issue, I would be a forest ranger or a parks person or a healer instead of a CPA.  Of course the incessant need to organize is satisfied by what I do as well as the need to be highly mental at times.   I would also be a professional traveler.  What fun that would be.  I recently bought several books about money, well being, and right being.  I\'ve only read parts and done well with a debt reduction plan.  But let\'s face it I still like nice clothes, good food, travel and the other perks I enjoy.  One of those perks is not lots of time.  But I\'ve gained time by discontinuing TV watch a favorite pastime previously.  Perhaps this money issue is a learned behavior just like working too much.  Low self esteem would seem to be a common thread here.  What do I really want to do?  Don\'t know but I\'ll figure it out.  In the meantime, as long as I am happy what the hell.What a relief.  I am writing this at the end of the regular work day 5 instead of 10:30 like last night so I\'m still on an adrenaline rush.  I expect that tonight by 8 I will crash.  My assignment is again to explore my deep thoughts and feelings.  Since I\'ve set those aside for a few days I feel like I have none.  I know they\'re down there but just not accessible at this moment.  I could tell today that I was more irritable than prior days.  I think working in excess of 12 hours several days in a row has made me feel robbed or cheated of my time.  Not that what I\'ve been working on hasn\'t been worthwhile.  But how much of life am I missing because of work.  Clearly too much.  I don\'t recall this pattern being established as a child.  I didn\'t study that much.  Of course school was easy and I didn\'t have to.  What is at the base of this perfectionist thing?  I don\'t recall my parents being particularly critical.  However when my dad was critical it was certainly no fun. And then there\'s the issue of perfect kids not rocking the boat.  Maybe I\'m using work to fill a void.  When I first entered the work force I had a long-term boyfriend.  a good reason to go home at night (at least that\'s the way I felt at the time).  Now what.  My dog.  An occasional date, friends, exercise but no one to really share time with, do things with, count on.  So I used to fill in with TV.  But I\'ve stopped that for the last month.  So I read more, clean more, and play with the dog more.  I would say I\'ve found other fillers albeit ones that are better for my physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.  I thought about using a dating service.  Being a professional woman I find it difficult or at least time consuming and energy consuming to try to meet men.  Being at the city has expanded my horizons, but not nearly enough.  I really hate to spend the money but it may be worth it.  Of course I figure as soon as I make that investment, one of my occasional dates will decide to get more serious.  (Sounds like yet another excuse to avoid commitment).  Once one of my old bosses asked me if I was ever going to commit to anything.  He asked this in the context of work since he was a long term employee and I changed jobs every 3 to 5 years.  But the question did hit the point.  I haven\'t committed to anything for ages, except maybe work.  I even hate to make weekend commitments sometimes for fear of missing out on something better.  What a joy it would be if I could have the viewpoint of all the new possibilities I create when I do make a commitment in a certain direction.  Of course once I make that commitment I expect that things will go exactly according to my plans and if they don\'t I am disappointed.   Remember (I need to remember) how important moment to moment existence is and what it could mean to me in terms of commitment and my life.  I never really thought about this before but you can really only commit in this moment.  It\'s not really a future thing.  It\'s a continuous right now thing.  And it doesn\'t limit you possibilities but expands them.  Because by committing you are more likely to attract what you are really looking for.  Once intent is out there the things happen or to coin a popular movie phrase, Build it and they will come.  I don\'t feel particularly better or worse right now but I\'m in a zone and could fall asleep any moment.I\'ve got this really whiney negative employee who sometimes irritates me to the extreme.  Today was one of those days.  Rather than trying to resolve a problem herself, she chooses to whine to me or allow her staff to whine to me.  If it irritates me that much there must be an issue.  I remember when I was young my Dad would get home from work.  Usually the first thing my Mom would do is tell him all the things that went wrong during the day.  Of course he had had a rough day too and didn\'t want to hear about an additional set of problems before he had relaxed and forgotten about the first set.  So an argument usually ensued, an unpleasant experience for me. I had never realized the correlation before.  Also I have little tolerance for the negative part of me (when I even realize I\'m being that way).  I\'ve hit a dead end here.  Probably it\'s significant.  Why do I hate the negative part of me.  Because I should be happy all the time?    Because it doesn\'t do any good if I\'m negative.  Because it puts negative energy out there and at a deep level that just doesn\'t feel right.  So why am I negative.  Insecure, low self esteem.  Lack of personal worth.  Some of the above.  I\'ve gotten better over the last few years but I\'m still way too negative.  It\'s also a defense mechanism.  If you have that sarcastic cutting humor you always feel one up on the other guy, better than them.  Less vulnerable.  but what does this have to do with negative whining employees?  Maybe its a power game with her.  The way she delegates upward.  Maybe its just a way of life.  And if I\'m less vulnerable I\'m more likely to be hurt.  God only knows I don\'t want to be hurt.  Another lull in ideas.  Keep writing and it will unblock.  So hurt.  How can being negative myself hurt me.  Why do I do it.  Low self esteem, nobody loves me attitude at some level.  Clearly at the intellectual level I feel much liked and admired.  But at the emotional level there must be a big gap.  Maybe that\'s why all the writing over the last two days about being alone, having work be too much of my life.  Needing my new friend to want to be with me more than he wants to be with his ex-wife.  That really hurts and it reinforces the emotional gap that\'s already there.  Maybe that\'s why i picked him.  He fits the mold.  Maybe this time instead of whining about what he isn\'t doing for me, with me or to me, i will use this as an opportunity to identify what I really need, what could help me break this pattern, what would help me realize that there really is not an emotional void there, just a big block combined with some self denial.  This is the relationship I need right now to get me beyond my prior emphasis and into a solid sharing relationship with a good man.  It\'s time.  I was so happy sharing vacation time with him, I had forgotten how important a part of my life that had been in the past and how much I missed it.  Of course, I feel much more comfortable with him than so many others, I wonder how hard that will be to duplicate.  Not very hard at all I think.  Because I\'m learning how to do it and that its safe to do it and that I\'m better off and happier sharing than trying to protect and hide myself and my feelings.',3,-5,1,2,5,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,0,0,0,0,2.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.07,0,0,0,0,1.56,0,2.59,1.04,0,1.04,0,0,3.11,0,0,0,0,0,1.04,0,1.04,0,0,12.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.09,0,0,1.04,0,0,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.81,17.64,0,2.07,0,0,3.11,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.26,Female

'The primary source of my stress/anxiety in my life does not come from my job.  The source of this anxiety is that I\'ve been keeping a secret from my family my entire life.  And now that my parents are about to move to Arizona I feel like the time has come to tell them that their son is queer.  I struggled with the issue for many years while growing up, but finally came to terms with it about 4 years ago, but by then I was already in college and 200 miles away from them.  Now I am completely happy with a decent job and living with my boyfriend in a very nice apartment but my parents still don\'t know.  As time approaches for their move, I know they\'ll want to visit.  I will have to tell them beforehand.  I am sure that they will be as supportive as always... I\'m not afraid of their response to the news, and yet I still can\'t bring myself to tell them.  I think its just because I\'ve been avoiding the issue with them for so long its become second nature.  It would be a great burden lifted from me once they know, but I just can\'t seem to find an appropriate opportunity.  I think it will have to be a letter.  It\'s much easier for me to express myself in writing than in spoken words.At this particular moment it is difficult to pinpoint any stress in my life.  The only stress I have experienced is vicariously through my boyfriend who hates his job and is currently seeking another one.  Whenever he calls from work, or comes home he goes on and on with how much he hates it and how miserable it makes him every moment that he\'s there.  I have trouble empathizing with him.  I know what his job is, and, granted, it isn\'t a great job, but I just can\'t fathom how it could be as horrible as he says it is.  Even my first fast-food job in high school I found tolerable.  I\'ve never been in a job that makes me miserable like that.  I generally don\'t talk about work when I am home because I enjoy my job and I don\'t want to \"rub it in\"I am having trouble coming up with things to write about.  Nothing has changed in the past two days.  I don\'t feel any undue stress at work and everything is great at home.  My biggest worry is that I need to buy some furniture soon.  Money really isn\'t that big of a concern for me, although I\'d like to be able to save a little more so that I can hopefully be able to buy a house in 2 or 3 years.  Rent is such a waste of money that you see no return on.

'It has been a trying year last five years for me.  I have been in the process of completely changing my life.  My life had become so unmanageable that I simply could not stand it the way it was anymore.  Starting over again in a completely new career field, as well has learning to have fun in healthy ways has been trying and lonely at times.  Changing patterns of behavior set over a period of forty years has been traumatic to say the least.  I have had to examine every aspect of my life in order to see what changes I could make to make my self a better person and my life a more fulfilling.  I had to face the fact that I had grown from a really mixed up kid, into a really mixed up adult.  That rude awakening coupled with the culture shock of moving from an oilfield and construction background to an administrative career has made it seem, at times like I was living in two different worlds.  With a lot of faith, hard work, and the kindness of many people, things are beginning to get better and better. I know deep down that if I don\'t give up and continue to believe that my life will continue to get better.  I have learned that the more I give, the more blessings I receive.  Onward the fog is clearing! The fact is that I grew up in a world of near chaos.  Certainly a world extreme stress and a lot of competition. Most of the time from the age of 12, it seemed that my life was all about surviving.  I started trying to find ways to make money about then.  My parents were divorced at that time and my little world went from bad to worse quickly.  Being the only male in the house, I was expected to take care of a lot things I just wasn\'t prepared for.  When I didn\'t live up to these expectations, I heard about it.  I became very resentful about going from the hero type jock, to the scapegoat.   I got into making fast money, then I got the families respect again.  This set up some bad patterns for me which many years to come to grips with. One was; I was liked for what I could do and what I could do for others NOT for being me. I strove to be the best for while, but there were times when it got to be too much and all I wanted to do was just get away. Away from people, even away from myself.  The pattern began where as if it was a physical threat I fought it physically, but if it was an emotional threat I ran from it.  If I couldn\'t fight with my fist and feet, I ran from it.  But I\'m aware of these things now and for that reason I can change these patterns and develop more healthy ones.  My life is getting better and better all the time.  I can tell people of things I have seen that would scare the hell out of most people, by taking all my experiences, good and bad, I can use them to create a better person. Self creativity, the greatest form of creativity.   Thanks ',3,-4,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,0,0,7.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,0,18.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,14.47,7.23,0,0,0,3.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,Male
'Today is Sunday, June 21.  It\'s Father\'s Day, but my two sons don\'t usually pay much attention to commercial holidays.  Besides, one of them is living in State College, Pennsylvania.  The other is in the process of moving and plans to come by in the afternoon to borrow our pickup truck.  I\'m awake now; it\'s about 7:30am, and coffee is  -  as usual -  the first thing on my mind.  Grind the beans; boil water; set up the filter; then go out front to pick up the paper.I like to prop up in bed with the paper and a fresh, hot cup of Colombian Supremo.  First I have sorted the paper to keep the parts I will read, and put the rest (classifieds, advertising inserts, and the like) into the recycling bin.Not much of interest in the paper, but I read the Sports section, City State, Front Page section, Insight, and all the others - as I drink coffee and get hungry for breakfast.  Finished with the paper, I now think about what is for breakfast.  (By the way, my wife is in New York all this month, so I am Bachelor - ing  it.)  Two strips of bacon left, from the indulgence of not having my health - conscious mate around to remind me of how unhealthy it is.  So I fry up the bacon and break an egg in the skillet to make a breakfast sandwich.  I use seven grain bread, a slice of sharp cheddar, and a sliced tomato.  Slather mayonnaise on toasted bread and pile the sandwich high.  Then a glass of cold milk and another cup of coffee, followed by a glass of orange juice, not from concentrate but fresh-squeezed (and pasteurized).Get dressed about 10am and wander out to the back yard with coffee.  Garden needs watering, so I set up the sprinkler and turn on the hose.  Then I dip water out of the rain barrel and water all the potted plants, several dozen.  Mosquitoes are bad, so I spray on the Cutter\'s.  There\'s a hole made by squirrels in the screening I have tied over the smaller rain barrel.  I think I have more screening, but I don\'t look for it.  It\'s getting hot.  Actually, it never got very cool last night.  Yesterday was a sizzler.  I was at our ranch in Bosque County, having made the three - hour drive to the cabin Friday evening so I could wake up Saturday early and start watering the newly-planted fruit trees and pecan trees, about two dozen of them.  By four o\'clock Saturday afternoon, however, the thermometer read 111 degrees, so I started making plans to come back to Austin Saturday night.Leaving the sprinkler going, I go back inside to get cool.  My big plan for the day is to watch the USA Open Golf Tournament, but it doesn\'t start until 1:00pm, and it\'s about 11am now.  So, I start in again on my latest reading project, a novel -  Carlos Fuentes\'s The Death of Artemio Cruz.Lunch is a Sloppy Joe sandwich, open faced.  I chop onions, some Meyers garlic sausage (also usually forbidden), a little pepperoni and start them all frying in the skillet.  Then I add catsup, Stubb\'s Original Barbecue sauce, and a little Schlotzky\'s hot sauce.  More seven grain toast with mustard on it.  Munching the sandwich, I catch whatever\'s on TV for a while, until 1:00pm.  Then the US Open comes on, but the leaders won\'t tee off for another hour and a half, so I alternate between watching and reading.The Open is exciting, because Payne Stewart, who has been leading the whole way, begins to slip back a little.  At one point, he was six strokes ahead of the field, but he drops back to four up.  No one else seems to be making a move on him.  Nick Price can\'t make any birdies.  Tom Lehman, who\'s playing with Stewart  in the last group, bogies several hole early and never challenges.  But Lee Jansen begins making birdies and soon closes to within a stroke.  Then he ties; then he goes ahead.  But Stewart doesn\'t collapse and birdies back to even.  Jansen, however, keeps making birdies and takes a one shot lead at 18.  Then he has to wait while Payne plays the last hole.  All Payne has to do is birdie the last hole to tie and take the Open into a playoff on Monday.  So he hit his second shot to within about 12 feet.  His putt looks good until the last two feet; then it trails off to the left, and Jansen wins.My friend Ray calls from Fort Worth; we make plans to talk Wednesday, as we are trying to arrange to meet at the ranch (which is only an hour from Fort Worth).  Ray\'s mother has just died, however, and less than a month before that, his younger brother killed himself in despair over a poorly lived life.  Ray is staying with his father and is trapped in Fort Worth until the old man dies.  Ray won\'t spend the money to hire someone to stay with his father, so he is stuck with it himself  - a longer story than I can relate here.  I call Anna in New York and we make plans to take a long weekend at the ranch when she returns on July 2.  We discuss how things are going in New York and at the ranch and agree that we will be very glad to see each other.I call my son, Dylan, who has said he wants the truck.  He wishes me happy Father\'s Day, and I invite him to go out for dinner.  He needs me to help him with the sofa I gave him last year.  When he comes over, we go to Guero\'s, but the 45 minute wait takes us to Curra\'s, down the street.  We have enchiladas.  Then we get the truck, and I follow him to North Austin and help move the sofa.  I meet his new roommate, a stout black guy, also a musician, like Dylan.  But Dylan and I have talked about his future plans.  He\'s thinking of Law School, as being a musician doesn\'t seem to him a very good way of supporting himself.  To his credit, after finishing his BFA at UT, he decides to take a year off to play music and work, and now he seems to be thinking more clearly than he has.  He likes music a lot and is very talented, but he doesn\'t want to live in poverty just so he can be a musician. When I get back from North Austin, It\'s bed time, so I curl up with Carlos Fuentes again, and soon fall asleep.Today is Tuesday, June 23.  I woke up at 5 am, unable to go back to sleep, so I get up and fix coffee.  The paper hasn\'t come yet, so I continue with the Fuentes novel until I hear the paper hit the front yard, about 6 am.Another slow news day, it seems, but I dutifully plow through.  Iran eliminates US from World Cup competition.  Phil Jackson is definitely leaving the Bulls, but MJ hints that he is staying (MJ has been in Austin, playing golf and giving a clinic).  Scottie is likely to leave anyway.  One article - on the Rockets - suggests that Houston may be looking at Pippen.  They clearly need some younger players and have good prospects in the draft tomorrow, especially after their trading of Kevin Willis, in which they picked up two early round draft choices.  But the Bulls will never be the same again.  My stocks both lost a little in the market yesterday.  Darn!Finished the paper, made the bed and went to have breakfast.  A good boy today, I have Cheerios (HEB brand) with Texas peaches.  Looked through Anna\'s MS Magazine while eating.  I didn\'t know that MS has no advertising.  That explains the $35 a year subscription price for a quarterly.  Good luck, MS.Out back for a little \"puttering\" before showering and dressing for work.  I put on my  25 - year - old resoled Redwing boots.  My new steel - toe boots are at the ranch, so I\'m keeping the old ones here for everyday use.  I notice that I have a pair of Cowboy boots that are over 40 years old.  I got them the year I graduated from High School (1957).  Time to take some clothes and stuff to HOBO. I arrive at work by just after 8 am, unusual for me, who usually work from 8:30 to 5:30.  Waiting for me is the draft report from the Sustainable Energy Task Force, a project that has gone on far too long, now.  I edit it carefully, more than a little distressed that it is no better than it is.  This should have been finished over a month ago, but we have not had a graphic artist to put it together.  I have had the text edited for several months, but have needed assistance with the graphics.  Our new GA started behind, so it has been a struggle to get him to focus on finishing this document.  Maybe I should say that the biggest problem in the modern world is the incompatibility between Macintosh computers and IBM PCs.  Add to that the problems with printers, and you have 90\% of the dysfunctional of the modern workplace.  Oops!  Looks like I\'m into opinions today - sorry.Finished my edits, made several copies (for Laurence and Fred, as well as Mike Sloan, because Laurence called me to say he had lost the previous version and that Fred Yebra needs to see the report in whatever stage it is in now).  Drove over to Mike Sloan\'s office and then to Two Commodore Plaza; go first to Floor 16, Watershed Protection, where I pick up several things and leave off one.  Then up to 17, where I take the two reports to Laurence and Fred.  Laurence and I discuss the SETF Report and then talk about the next big Sustainability project -  the assessment of the Public Works Department\'s efforts toward sustainable operations.Back to the office at OTC.  Quik Print has called.  The 600 color copies are ready.  So I call to ask them to deliver.  Worked a little with Spencer on what  we call the \"Wrench\" document, owing to the wrench graphic on the side of it.  That was one of the things I picked up at TCP -  a font we needed and the Spanish translation.I decide I have time to go to FasClampitt to pick up Susan\'s Earth Camp paper before my 1:00 o\'clock meeting with Bonnie Ford of Metro Traffic Network, where Tony Gregg wants to run 63 messages a week at drive time to talk about the watering schedule for citizens.  FasClampitt has enlarged their store and evidently fired Robert, the former manager there.  The new manager is Barry, whom I\'ve spoken to many times ordering paper from the wholesale Clampitt Paper.  Barry calls me by name, because, I find out, he was in a writing class of mine at ACC in about 1984 -  he and his twin brother.  I cannot recall them and don\'t lie about it.  Still, I\'m glad he remembers.  Funny he never mentioned it to me when I ordered paper over the phone.  I guess when he saw me in person, that did it for him - the name plus the face.I rush to Jazz on 6th St for my meeting with Bonnie.  Just make it.  Bonnie has her sales manager with her, a guy named Steve from San Antonio.  I sign contracts, agree to get them new messages by 4:00 PM on the FAX.  We discuss my St Edward\'s classes, since Bonnie is interested in finishing her degree.  Needs eight more courses.  Steve admits to having no higher education; has worked his way up.  I talk about my Third World Writers class and the new one I\'m working on - Future Fiction.  They buy me lunch - beer battered fried shrimp (half order--Anna would be proud).Then  back to the office to unload the paper for Susan and call Dick Peterson at Water Conservation to meet with me to decide the messages for Metro Network.  A few more things, including more working with Spencer on our various projects.  Then I\'m off to Dick\'s office at Waller Creek Plaza, where we work out a week\'s messages for them to start Monday June 29. After that, Tony will be back and we can revisit that matter.  Dick and I talk about our jobs.  He\'s trying to get out, and I may be interested in his old job with Tony and Water Conservation.Back to OTC for more work with Spencer, a report to Celeste on the day\'s activities and on several projects we have going, and a discussion of how to enter this writing time on my time sheet.Then I sat down to write.',3,-4,1,2,1,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,1.84,0,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,6.44,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.76,Male
'Yesterday was a very typical day in my life.The clock radio alarm went off at 6:15 and I rolled out of bed.  After aquick trip to the bathroom, the first thing I did was fix a bowl of cerealand then sat down in front of the TV for the morning news.  I don\'t recallif anything noteworthy in the news, therefore it  was likely not muchhappened during the night.After the quick meal I  took a shower and then chose some new clothes that were fathers days gifts to wear.  The worst part of the morning ritual isshaving.  It  takes about as long as the shower and dressing combined andif I miss a spot it ends up bothering me all day long.I grabbed a dish of leftovers from the night before for lunch and headed towork.Lately I\'ve been trying to catch the song of the day to enter a radiocontest, so I listen for it on the way to work in the car.Once at work I have a ritual there too. I try to answer the daily triviachallenge at the car talk web site.I\'ve been playing for months and seem to be stuck at a 60\% accuracy.  Theaverage for everyone one play is 50\% so I guess it isn\'t so bad  after all. The question was why do the manasi tribe in Africa spit at each other? Theanswer was for good luck.  I guessed that one right.At work I try to plan the day and take advantage of the quite mornings toget  more done.  Many of the typical daily events aren\'t schedulablebecause customers just drop by and request map products.I worked off and on throughout the day on a project of placing maps intoword documents for someone in another division.  Much work went into thewhole process of making the maps and I wasn\'t sure if it showed in thefinal format.  We also had a drop what you are doing condition to producesome maps that were involved with a city law suit.  After 4 of us bustedour butts for hours suddenly the word came to us that we didn\'t need tomake the maps after all because another group was working on them.  It wasthe first urgent request I\'ve had since I\'ve been there and I was impressedwith my group.At 4::30 I headed home to grab a quick  bite to eat and then change clothesfor job number two.  It is at a local auto parts store and probably the cause of the majority of thestress in my life.   I wanted a no brain part time job, but ended up witha no brain manager and a seriously under staffed store.  Occasionally thereis a grateful customer who really appreciates all the help they received,but most people are impatient and ungrateful.  Time is up.This morning I got up at the usual time of  6:15 and made a bowl of cereal.  Because I grabbed the box  in the dark I didn\'t get the one I wanted, butit was too late once I realized it.  After the cereal and the shower and shave routine I picked out clothes thatwould be better suited for hot weather than I had the day before.Right on schedule I was out of the house and making the short drive towork.Once there, I parked in my usual space and was ready for another day.  After getting situated at my desk I went to the car talk web site andchecked out the daily question.I took a guess that happy birthday is the most sung song by Americans overthe national anthem and none of the above.  Yesterday I didn\'t even have aguess at what royalty did with bathing to show their wealth, but the answerwas none, they didn\'t bath to show they were wealthy enough to not work.After 5 minutes of trivia nonsense  it was time to get busy.I got with it to take advantage of the quite morning time.  There werethree old items from yesterday.One was a topographical map for a previous customer, but we had lost his old files so it had to be completely redone. The second was to finish the data to put on the CD that will be mass produced and sold through the document saleswindow.  Finally, my boss and I still had to discuss the results of ourinterviews for an open position in my section.After working all morning on the topographical map and plotting a final copy Igrabbed a quick bite at the state cafeteria across the street. Hadn\'t beenthere before, but all state cafeterias are  the same aside from thecapital.The customer showed up after lunch and looked at the map I had prepared. He said it wasn\'t what he wanted.  He wanted the 2 foot interval not the 10foot interval.  Well, he didn\'t specify the 2 foot interval, rather onlystating he wanted the contours. After checking a pilot study database Ifound that we did have the 2 foot intervals, but I would have to redo themap (which will have to wait till tomorrow).My boss and I settled on one of  the candidates for the position.  He wasmuch better suited, and I willeagerly await his  transfer to my section.  The CD will have to wait too. Between many calls and interruptions it justhas to wait.  However, as soon as we get the mass produced CD\'s back itwill hopefully make our job load slightly easier because some customerswill become self sufficient.After work I headed over to pick up this assignment.  This time I got smartand parked in front rather than driving all around the parking garage.I don\'t work at the part time job again until Saturday so this evening Igot to spend some quality time with my wife and our baby girl.  She isgrowing so fast and developing by leaps and bounds.After a home cooked meal of  pot roast and mashed potatoes we loaded up the car and went to the mall for a long over due hair cut.  Why are all men hair dressers gay?  I will wonder that forever.  After all,it would be a great job for a heterosexual male to meet women.  Oh well.  Iguess it just lets us heterosexuals send our wives or girlfriends to gettheir hair done in complete confidence that they will returnnon propositioned.     I wrapped up the day by watching the second episode of star trek nextgeneration.  It\'s hard to believe that was 12 years ago.till next time.

'I woke up at 5:30am after hitting the snooze button one time.  Better than average.  Sore back.  Got out of bed,  Got my coffee,  Wandered around the house while drinking my coffee.  Selected my clothing for the day, took my shower, got dressed, kissed Rhonda and left for work.  Arrived on time at work.  Greeted Mark as I was getting off the elevator.  Said hi to Tim and Monty.  Told everyone about the great vacation I had.  Started work by returning calls and changing greeting on voicemail.  Got call from APS.  Got low down on a Dell project that was due out last Friday.  Real rush job.  Finished reviewing plan that was on my desk.  Found dell job and started it.  Questions from Monty and Tookie about lunch.  Went to Hobby Building with Monty.  Had double cheeseburger, fries and soda. Saw Tammy while I was there.  Took opportunity to get latest info on Motorola North Campus Project.  Next meeting set for Wed. at 9am.  Phase I site Plan approved.  Does not allow for construction beyond first floor slab.  Told Tammy that building was approved for full shell build out and that site plan has reins at this time.  She was OK with that.  Tammy was nervous about the project because it was her first fast track site plan and the experience can leave your head swimming.  I told her that this project was moving along nicely and that I thought she was doing an outstanding job leading her new team.  She was worried because she had gotten some crap about the project not meeting schedule.  The delays were the result of the design team and project changes from the owners side.  I told Tammy that it was a bluff and not to worry.  Said bye.  Went back to office.  Finished Dell project.  Started Spin Cycle Laundromat.  Lots of plumbing.  This one is going to take a while.  Phone is ringing off the hook.   Hard to stay focused on plans.  3pm Go to meeting with Michael Crow.  Interesting series of questions.  Some are brutally blunt.  Hey, that works.  Somebody needs to ask the hard questions.  It\'s about time someone had the balls.  I get tired of the semi-annual kiss off ritual of the Employee Survey.  Its a management exercise where you validate your beliefs about how the department and city are doing by what questions you ask, how you ask them, and by what questions you carefully avoid asking.  I digress. Got back to my desk.  Returned phone calls.  Did a little more review on Spin Cycle plans.  Have to leave on time today to make chiropractors appointment.  I see him about every 2 - 4 weeks.  Talked to Dr Wottrick about the trip, how the folks are doing.  Discussed my left shoulder - pinched nerve.  It was acting up over vacation.  Good adjustment.  Shoulders and back feel much better.  Got call from Rhonda.  Meet kids and sitter at Garrison park.  Leave doctor for park.  Enjoyed watching kids play in pool.  Its cooler than I thought it would be.  Rhonda and Teri meet us at pool and we all go to Golden Corral.  It is good to visit with Teri. Lots to talk about.  I leave with Teri and Dwayne (sitter) and take them home while Rhonda leaves with kids for our home.  Kids are tired.  Bath and bed.  So am I.  I do the same.Alarm went off at 5:30.  Rolled out of bed @ 5:45.  Fixed coffee, shower, shave, etc.  Got into work at 8:00.  Check voicemail--one message from Michael Crow.  Check e-mail.  Return e-mail to Don Lujan--Motorola about the code requirements for their new boiler.  Read e-mail from Kevin Sandbury-AMD.  Gave him a call.   Discussed the new exhaust system.  New plan addresses all code requirements.  Need site plan correction, AFD approval, TNRCC approval,  With these conditions met, OK to proceed under Registered Industrial Plant Program.  9:00 am-go to Motorola North Campus coordination meeting,  Good meeting.  Project is moving forward nicely,   Stage 2 site plan is in for review, will be completed on Friday.  This stage will permit erection of structural shell.  Break out sessions w/ various design team members to discuss documents for Tenant Finish-out package.  Expect plans week from Friday, Meeting adjourned at 10:00.  Go upstairs to gather the stuff for 10:30 meeting at Fire Dept.  Customer in waiting area.  Flagged down by receptionist.  This guy wants a full blown review of his plans before he turns them in.  This is going to make me late.  Quickly review plans.  Call AFD, tell them that I\'m going to be late.  Get to AFD at 10:45.  Short meeting.  Proposed project complies with requirements for that level of the building.  Had follow-on meeting with Ron Buy--AFD about AFD &DRID staffing levels and various issues on the radar screen.  AFD wrote up 50+ violations on latest annual inspection of EB campus.  Lots of HPM problems.  Problems with lack of sprinklers in tools.  I think that they got Motorola\'s attention!  Will need to keep track of this one as it progresses.  I go back to DRID, grab my lunch from fridge and have lunch in basement.  Headline News.  Tim Taylor shows up about 15 minutes later.  We have a great discussion about office policy, computers, kids and such.  Go back upstairs.  Return phone calls.  Review 3 sets of plans.  Small problem with Dell F-801.  Talk to Mary & Debra to make sure permit gets issued today.  Go see Michael Crow.As soon as this session is over I will walk out into that convection oven we call Austin this summer.  I will go to my car, open the doors and let it air out for a few minutes, get in, close the doors, start the engine, that the Air Conditioner (Maximum air, of course), pull out of the parking lot and head west on 2nd street.  Tonight I need to stop at Wal-Mart before I go home.  My wife called earlier and gave me a list.  I will drive to Wal-Mart and pick up the four things she asked for.  After I am done with that, I will drive home.  It\'s a relaxing drive through hill country and takes about 30 minutes.  I will listen to the radio.  I don\'t feel like NPR tonight so I\'ll probably listen to KGSR or Z102.  When I get home the smoked chicken should be done.  I\'ll sit down with my family and eat dinner.  When dinner is over we will all help clear the table.  Tonight I need to write an appeal on my latest tax appraisals.  That should pretty well take care of the free time I have this evening.  Get the kids bathed and ready for bed.  With any luck I\'ll get to bed earlier tonight.

'The primary source of my stress anxiety in my life does not come from my job.  The source of this anxiety is that I\'ve been keeping a secret from my family my entire life.  And now that my parents are about to move to Arizona I feel like the time has come to tell them that their son is queer.  I struggled with the issue for many years while growing up, but finally came to terms with it about 4 years ago, but by then I was already in college and 200 miles away from them.  Now I am completely happy with a decent job and living with my boyfriend in a very nice apartment but my parents still don\'t know.  As time approaches for their move, I know they\'ll want to visit.  I will have to tell them beforehand.  I am sure that they will be as supportive as always.  I\'m not afraid of their response to the news, and yet I still can\'t bring myself to tell them.  I think its just because I\'ve been avoiding the issue with them for so long its become second nature.  It would be a great burden lifted from me once they know, but I just can\'t seem to find an appropriate opportunity.  I think it will have to be a letter.  It\'s much easier for me to express myself in writing than in spoken words.At this particular moment it is difficult to pinpoint any stress in my life.  The only stress I have experienced is vicariously through my boyfriend who hates his job and is currently seeking another one.  Whenever he calls from work, or comes home he goes on and on with how much he hates it and how miserable it makes him every moment that he\'s there.  I have trouble empathizing with him.  I know what his job is, and, granted, it isn\'t a great job, but I just can\'t fathom how it could be as horrible as he says it is.  Even my first fast food job in high school I found tolerable.  I\'ve never been in a job that makes me miserable like that.  I generally don\'t talk about work when I am home because I enjoy my job and I don\'t want to rub it in.I am having trouble coming up with things to write about.  Nothing has changed in the past two days.  I don\'t feel any undue stress at work and everything is great at home.  My biggest worry is that I need to buy some furniture soon.  Money really isn\'t that big of a concern for me, although I\'d like to be able to save a little more so that I can hopefully be able to buy a house in 2 or 3 years.  Rent is such a waste of money that you see no return on.  This session is going to have to be a little short.',3,-4,0,1,5,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,16,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,44,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,56,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,12,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,Male
'Today is one of those days when there is a clear conflict between my life as a single parent and my responsibilities to my employer.  My kids should be with me tonight under my divorce decree, but can not because I have a meeting and a public hearing.  This was true last week and will be true next week.  There are times that I feel that others at my level and above have no appreciation what sacrifices single parents make in terms of reward and recognition.  I have been doing this since my kids were born, although I have only been a single parent for the last five years.  It is as if they are still in a 1950\'s lifestyle where one parent stays home or they are so affluent that they can pay for a sitter when they are gone.Today was a great day.  I helped out at the parks department on a problem they have been trying to solve for years, and we may bring a solution to their board in the next week.  They gave me a pizza at the noon time meeting, which helped me on other tasks this afternoon.  I finished another major legislative assignment and am completing two other major educational projects.  I feel like I produce products that others can\'t or won\'t, but this does not get acknowledged or appreciated at a level that is appropriate.I feel tired, but realize that I probably have at least 3 1/2 hours before my day ends.  Twelve hours without a break is hard on me, but this writing exercise gives me some pause.Yesterday I shared my perspective on department operations with the Director and she seemed to agree with me.  The jury is out on whether this will impact our operations.Yesterday I worked 14 hours without a break or lunch (I got two pieces of pizza at a noon-time meeting).  I am involved in very high profile, controversial issues yet I am told I will never be able to get a performance based increase again.  It appears to me that I will lose more money to inflation each year (my rent is going up $25 a month beginning next month, so that continued high effort at work that I enjoy and find meaningful will result in a diminution of my standard of living.  I think that our economic well being weighs on our mind and on our family, and I don\'t want to tell my kids that I can\'t keep up with inflation.  Today, I was told that something wasn\'t ready that I knew wasn\'t ready, and the message was conveyed in a condescending way as if I had no sense of reality.  Despite my concurrence with the caller\'s assessment, the caller tried to persuade me that I had acted inappropriately when I had not.  I did receive high praise last night from one of the staff\'s most vociferous critics, who suggested to Planning Commission that I might seek the Secretary of State\'s job to help solve world controversies.  This type of comment keeps me going.Again another incredibly frantic day.  People with time sensitive assignments not getting them to me.  A very productive but at the same time frustrating day.',3,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.68,0,0,0,0,3.68,0,0,0,12.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.19,Male
'I woke up at 5:30 am after hitting the snooze button one time.  Better than average.  Sore back.  Got out of bed,  Got my coffee,  Wandered around the house while drinking my coffee.  Selected my clothing for the day, took my shower, got dressed, kissed Rhonda and left for work.  Arrived on time at work.  Greeted Mark as I was getting off the elevator.  Said hi to Tim and Monty.  Told everyone about the great vacation I had.  Started work by returning calls and changing greeting on voicemail.  Got call from APS.  Got low down on a Dell project that was due out last Friday.  Real rush job.  Finished reviewing plan that was on my desk.  Found dell job and started it.  Questions from Monty and Tookie about lunch.  Went to Hobby Building with Monty.  Had double cheeseburger, fries and soda. Saw Tammy while I was there.  Took opportunity to get latest info on Motorola North Campus Project.  Next meeting set for Wed. @9am.  Phase I site Plan approved.  Does not allow for construction beyond first floor slab.  Told Tammy that building was approved for full shell buildout and that site plan has reins at this time.  She was OK with that.  Tammy was nervous about the project because it was her first fast track site plan and the experience can leave your head swimming.  I told her that this project was moving along nicely and that I thought she was doing an outstanding job leading her new team.  She was worried because she had gotten some crap about the project not meeting schedule.  The delays were the result of the design team and project changes from the owners side.  I told Tammy that it was a bluff and not to worry.  Said bye.  Went back to office.  Finished Dell project.  Started Spin Cycle laundromat.  Lots of plumbing.  This one is going to take a while.  Phone is ringing off the hook.   Hard to stay focused on plans.  3pm-Go to meeting with Michael Crow.  Interesting series of questions.  Some are brutally blunt.  Hey, that works.  Somebody needs to ask the hard questions.  It\'s about time someone had the balls.  I get tired of the semi-annual kiss off ritual of the Employee Survey.  Its a management exercise where you validate your beliefs about how the department and city are doing by what questions you ask, how you ask them, and by what questions you carefully avoid asking.  I digress. Got back to my desk.  Returned phone calls.  Did a little more review on Spin Cycle plans.  Have to leave on time today to make chiropractors appointment.  I see him about every 2-4 weeks.  Talked to Dr. Wottrick about the trip, how the folks are doing.  Discussed my left shoulder--pinched nerve.  It was acting up over vacation.  Good adjustment.  Shoulders and back feel much better.  Got call from Rhonda.  Meet kids and sitter at Garrison park.  Leave doctor for park.  Enjoyed watching kids play in pool.  Its cooler than I thought it would be.  Rhonda and Teri meet us at pool and we all go to Golden Corral.  It is good to visit with Teri. Lots to talk about.  I leave with Teri and Dwayne (sitter) and take them home while Rhonda leaves with kids for our home.  Kids are tired.  Bath and bed.  So am I.  I do the same.Alarm went off at 5:30.  Rolled out of bed @ 5:45.  Fixed coffee, shower, shave, etc.  Got into work at 8:00.  Check voicemail--one message from Michael Crow.  Check e-mail.  Return e-mail to Don Lujan--Motorola about the code requirements for their new boiler.  Read e-mail from Kevin Sandbury-AMD.  Gave him a call.   Discussed the new exhaust system.  New plan addresses all code requirements.  Need site plan correction, AFD approval, TNRCC approval,  With these conditions met, OK to proceed under Registered Industrial Plant Program.  9:00 am-go to Motorola North Campus coordination meeting,  Good meeting.  Project is moving forward nicely,   Stage 2 site plan is in for review, will be completed on Friday.  This stage will permit erection of structural shell.  Break out sessions w/ various design team members to discuss documents for Tenant Finish-out package.  Expect plans week from Friday, Meeting adjourned at 10:00.  Go upstairs to gather the stuff for 10:30 meeting at Fire Dept.  Customer in waiting area.  Flagged down by receptionist.  This guy wants a full blown review of his plans before he turns them in.  This is going to make me late.  Quickly review plans.  Call AFD, tell them that I\'m going to be late.  Get to AFD at 10:45.  Short meeting.  Proposed project complies with requirements for that level of the building.  Had follow-on meeting with Ron Buy--AFD about AFD &DRID staffing levels and various issues on the radar screen.  AFD wrote up 50+ violations on latest annual inspection of EB campus.  Lots of HPM problems.  Problems with lack of sprinklers in tools.  I think that they got Motorola\'s attention!  Will need to keep track of this one as it progresses.  I go back to DRID, grab my lunch from fridge and have lunch in basement.  Headline News.  Tim Taylor shows up about 15 minutes later.  We have a great discussion about office policy, computers, kids and such.  Go back upstairs.  Return phone calls.  Review 3 sets of plans.  Small problem w/Dell F-801.  Talk to Mary & Debra to make sure permit gets issued today.  Go see Michael Crow.As soon as this session is over I will walk out into that convection oven we call Austin this summer.  I will go to my car, open the doors and let it air out for a few minutes, get in, close the doors, start the engine, that the AC (Max air, of course), pull out of the parking lot and head west on 2nd street.  Tonight I need to stop at Walmart before I go home.  My wife called earlier and gave me a list.  I will drive to Walmart and pick up the four things she asked for.  After I am done with that, I will drive home.  It\'s a relaxing drive through hill country and takes about 30 minutes.  I will listen to the radio.  I don\'t feel like NPR tonight so I\'ll probably listen to KGSR or Z102.  When I get home the smoked chicken should be done.  I\'ll sit down with my family and eat dinner.  When dinner is over we will all help clear the table.  Tonight I need to write an appeal on my latest tax appraisals.  That should pretty well take care of the free time I have this evening.  Get the kids bathed and ready for bed.  With any luck I\'ll get to bed earlier tonight.

'I got up at 5:15 Monday Morning.  I put my clothes on watched the weather and left for work.  I always stop and get gas and coffee at Texas Star right outside of Jarrell.  I get to work at 6:30 AM.  I start coffee and read paper till 7:00 AM then start work.  I worked on plans till about 8:00 then stopped and talked to everyone coming to work.  I start at 7:00 am and everyone else starts at 7:45 or 8:00am.  As soon as the bull--session was over I went back to work.  We have many plans to look at right now.  I was off last Thursday and Friday so I was way behind.  I had over 30 plans that needed to be looked at.  I don\'t have a back up so I am always behind when I take off.  I am also the first one in the system so I can\'t afford to be behind.I stopped and ate a pie and a coke at lunch and re-read my paper.  This was from 12 to 1 PM.  At 1 I went back to work and worked straight through until 4 PM.  I finally caught up and was so happy I even stopped on the way home and got a haircut.  After I got home I read the mail and then went to the gym at school to see the new football coach.  I am on the school board at Jarrell and I like to be involved in all the sport things.  After talking to all the coaches I went home about 8:30 or 9:00 PM.  I stopped at the convenience store and bought a TV dinner.  I put the dinner in the oven and watched ESPN until I ate.  I also got 2 or 3 phone calls like I always get since I am now on the school board.  After watching the 10 PM news I finished eating and went and took a shower after that I went back and watched TV till about 10:50 PM.  There was nothing good on so I turned off the TV and went to bed.  I woke up my wife and asked her a few things that happened that day.  After we talked about family things I just laid there and thought about a lot of little things and eventually fell asleep.When I leave here I will go pick up my son from basketball camp. After I get home I will go get my granddaughters and take them to the house.  We will put my dog (Little Bit) in the truck with us and ride all over Jarrell.  After that I will open up the Gym so our kids can lift in the gym.  It is very important that our athletes lift during the off season.  After we close the Gym at 8:00 I will go home and probably make sandwiches for me and the girls.  After eating I will go over to Coach Sumner\'s house for a while.  We usually sit around and talk about everything for a hour or so while my granddaughter plays with his son.  Georgia is very active and I have to keep a eye on her.  He is the main reason I get up every morning.  She loves her Pa-Paw.  After about 10:00 Georgia and I will go to the house and I will put her to sleep.  She gets to spend the night with me every two or three weeks.  After she goes to sleep I will sit down and watch Cheers or Sports Center. I call this my key-down period.  Just sitting alone for a hour or so seems to put me in a good frame of mind.  I am so happy I don\'t have a school board meeting tonight.  It seems like they have drained me this week.At about 11:15 to 11:30 I will probably go to bed unless there is a good movie on TV.  Usually I go to bed and try to get about 6 hours sleep but tonight I will probably try to sleep a little longer.  Usually, although not common I will wake up my wife right before I go to bed and we will talk about things going on around our family and Jane.',3,-1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,0,0,0,0,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,10.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,0,0,7.24,Male
'What really concerns me in my life right now is the relationship between my mother and me, or I should say the lack of.  Ever since my Dad died, about 10 months ago, my relationship with my mother has been very dysfunctional.  I do care about her but I\'ve narrowed it down to the simple fact that I don\'t respect her and that coping with her type of sanity is a choice that I\'ve decided to avoid.  It\'s easier this way.  Many of her attitudes and actions that she has demonstrated to me in the past are simply not what I consider rational thinking.  She was always jealous of the kind of closeness that my dad and I had because we were more than father and son, we were each other confidant.  The only person we could turn to in times of trouble were each other.  We were the best of friends and truly enjoyed life and shared it when we could.  Then the good Lord came and got him.  As devastating as it was, life goes on, its just not as much fun.  My mother and I haven\'t had much to do with each other for about 6 months. She won\'t talk or visit (always says I\'m too busy) which is fine by me.  She has stopped treating like her son, so its real hard to try to get positive about even picking up the phone, calling her, and saying Hi.  Its stopped hurting because I\'ve closed up to this fact and being the don\'t fret about things type of guy that I\'m proud of and always look at the sunny side of life.  I\'ve grown not to let this bother me anymore, Life\'s too short.  It concerns me but doesn\'t bother me anymore.  My wife still has a hard time with it but given enough time, she\'ll blow it off too.  You see, distancing ourselves from this type of sanity of which we are not familiar with is healing in a way.  Besides since my Dad left, I\'ve got a new best friend and confidant.  I\'m married to her and I can\'t wait to get home and see her.Maybe I\'m too hard on myself or try to hard to be a perfectionist but its eating me up that things I\'ve done in the past are turning out not to be as I\'d hoped they\'d end up through out the years.  My wife wanted a vegetable garden.  I built and raised a garden along one end of the house and filled it full of dirt. Then to make vegetables grow better I thought a rain collection container at the end of the house, but the garden would be a nice change of pace for the garden (a nice country theme in the city) I ordered this 500 gallon cistern built a 2 ft. high slab to set it on, did all the plumbing and prayed for rain.  It rained, it filled up, the vegetables are to the likes of which I\'ve never seen.  But after 2 years of the cistern being installed, the thing is sinking. The slab is sinking, tilting, and now she got what I call the \"leaning tower of rainwater\".  It looks like hell and I don\'t know what to do about it.  I\'m no engineer but I figured 1 ton of concrete could support 2 tons of water.  Now after last night\'s 3/4 \" rain its full and I feel it will sink and lean even more.  I\'m helpless as to what to do to prevent any further sinking or leaning and what bothers me is why I couldn\'t have foreseen this, I mean, its only water sitting on a slab.  The only thing I can do is let nature take its course, but I feel less effective as I did before also a little humiliated and think I don\'t measure up to the guy I thought I was.  Its tough to swallow this pill but I guess its a live and learn type of lesson.  There are other objects and ideas that are similar to this but this is on the top of the chart.  I do know one thing, I\'ll never stop trying to outdo myself.  High standards or not, I need to do this to keep seeing how I measure up. I figure, if I cease trying things to see how I measure up, I\'m afraid I\'ll cease to exist, which is not an option for me.Well, on Day number 3, I suppose you\'ve been waiting for me to write about the topic of this experiment and discuss STRESS at work.  OK here goes.  I feel that I have been given a great opportunity in being employed at the city.  I thoroughly enjoy educating the public on how to do things (electrical things) safe.  It\'s a satisfying position and comfort to know someone is grateful that I\'ve helped.  But with the price of prosperity in Austin now, balancing who pays the price is tough.  I try to do the job to the best of my ability but trying to please the bosses and produce a timely product is not a reasonable or attainable goal at this time and to have them remind us of it weekly and daily is numbing.  I understand their position with push - push - push.  With this push - push - push perception of theirs, they\'re doing their job.  But who draws the line when push - push - push becomes unsafe - unsafe - unsafe.  My whole concern is customer safety.  If customer service lacks due to the fact that we are doing our jobs by producing a safe-safe-safe product then so be it.  I as try as I can to keep the safe-safe-safe product going out, it seems the push-push-push product is overshadowing it.  Its hard waking up and coming to work knowing my best isn\'t good enough for these \"bosses\".  And that I or we on the front line pay the price of prosperity and push a product through to calm the masses that might not meet out (the experts) standards.  It a tough atmosphere, but callous  up to all of that and knowing that the one who eventually pay the price of prosperity is the last victim in the line - the customer- So who draws the line?  Who watches out of the victimized, innocent customer?  The bosses run the masses, that\'s their job.  Doing our job nobody wins, the customer gets a substandard product, we do the best, but it is rated substandard and the bosses get substandard results.  No winners, just losers.  The price we all pay for prosperity in Austin.  I\'ve always envisioned this rope, on one end, the bosses, pulling as hard as they can to get the most of their employees.  On the other end, their employees.  It is the responsibility of the employee to pull back on this rope to do what they were hired to do.  Priority one.  Do what they pay you for to the best of their ability no matter who pays the price.  The customer expect the best, they deserve it no matter the outside forces trying to impede progress.  So yes, this job is stressful but if one knows it, realizes what it looks like, it can be absorbed, dealt with and excreted from one\'s system.  I don\'t worry, I\'m just trying to be happy.',3,-5,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,0,0,0,2.39,0,3.98,0,0,0,6.36,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,1.59,0,0,13.52,0,0.8,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,30.23,0,0,6.36,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,1.59,0,1.59,0,5.57,16.71,0,3.98,1.59,0,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.98,Male
'My life is very stressful because I\'ve got nothing but deadlines to work on.  Deadlines constantly, at home at work at play.  At work we have deadlines, at set amount of time to do our reviews.  If you don\'t finish on time, your late and the customer cries to our director that their plans are late.  Then the director instructs you to get the work done!  Which is another stressful thing because she is the one who laid people off in our section last year,  knowing full well that we would be very busy this year.At home I\'ve got little projects to do, or in the middle of doing more than one person can handle.  Now I\'ve got this big vacation planned, however, to go I need to buy a new truck to pull our tent trailer.  Problem is I can\'t find the time to even go look at a new truck let alone haggle over price and whatnot.  Money-wise a new truck is going to hurt because we are currently paying for the new tent-trailer, and a one year old car, not to mention the house payment.So I\'m trying to work extra hours to get my work done before I leave for vacation which takes time out of truck shopping and family life.I guess buying a new truck is more on my mind than anything right now.  I guess I\'ve been putting it off on purpose?  I don\'t know.  But I really need this truck to go on vacation, I really need the vacation to alleviate stress.  If worse comes to worse I could use my current truck and just hope we get there and back, but that would really be stressful.Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard at work.  Nobody here thanks me for it.  I could work a lot less and nobody would notice here. (customers would notice).  This is a crazy place, Austin is booming and growing like crazy, and we\'re short staffed.Another thing about my vacation is getting together with my family can be so, not stressful.  I can\'t think of the word.  Challenging I guess or frustrating.  Very seldom relaxing.  Why do I do it?Another busy day, after another busy night.  Last night I decided to tackle one of those home projects on my \"to do\" list.  It was putting together a kitchen curio.  I took it all out of the box, and the first piece of step \"1\" was broken, as well as another smaller piece.  It was late and I didn\'t feel like driving back to the store.  So tonight I\'ll have to do it.Today was just a busy customer day.  I had a whole lunch of walk - ins.  Each customer has their own little problems and they want me to solve them for them.  I was also trying to train the two new guys on how to help customers, what to look for, what to look out for.  You see, if I approve their plans, they get a permit today, if I don\'t its back to the drawing board.Now, tonight, I\'ve got to take the broken pieces back to K - mart.  And mess around until I get the right pieces back, and then rush off to my softball game.  All this with two energetic boys in tow.  Why, because they wanted to go to my softball game last week, but it was a late game and I told them, \"I\'ll take you next week.\"  They never forget.I might try to get my wife to bring the pieces back, but I\'m afraid she won\'t come back with the right pieces!I still need to get a new truck.  The days are flying by, and my vacation is getting closer and closer.One real good thing happened today.  I realized that with these new guys hired, things will be all right when I\'m on vacation.My supervisor is a real jerk.  He\'s off playing army for two weeks.  Now if you were a supervisor and you were hiring two new guys, wouldn\'t you make sure they had a phone and a computer?  My didn\'t.  These two new guys were left hanging.  We\'re scrambling around now trying to get them set up, while army boy is collecting two salaries, and earning none, meaning he\'s not doing squat!  I\'m sure we will hear about his fishing or his card playing, or whatever when he gets back.  Asshole!Bad day, busy day.  I\'ve got a massive headache.  I don\'t like to take aspirin, but tonight I may have to.Lots of customers in the office today, little help from co-workers.  One coworker this morning said that he didn\'t like the fact that I was helping him do his reviews WHICH ARE LATe because he felt that I wasn\'t trained enough.  That kind of hurt.  I\'m trying to help the guy and he\'s cutting me down.We hired two new guys last week, and like kids, they need training and help.  Of course, our supervisor is off for two weeks playing soldier, and the next guy in line set up these long meetings today so that left me, and these two new guys.  It\'s now them, but they are draining.  Having to explain every little thing, and deal with customers all day long and answer phone calls, and do plan reviews.  Too many irons on the fire.  I woke up tired today, so I kind of thought that it would be a bad day.Management has been floating around our section today checking on things.  Specifically a few projects that people called on complained that we were not reviewing fast enough.  That\'s crazy.  They say the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Boy is that ever true around here, but only if you\'re a customer.  If you\'re an employee and squeak, they find a way to get rid of you.  That\'s why nobody speaks up when we have staff meetings.  Well that\'s one reason.  Another is because no matter what we say, they\'re not going to do anything about it anyway.  They\'ve already got their mind made up.  Did have a good lunch today. It was relaxing.  Tomorrow is Friday, that\'s always good.  This weekend I\'m going truck hunting.  I\'m just writing thoughts as they pop in my head.  The stressors at work are:Management, work load, Coworkers who don\'t work as hard as I do, No recognition.',3,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.2,0,0,0,0,3.6,5.4,1.8,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,13.5,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,Male
'The most troubling portion of my life at the moment is how to find a mate.  It\'s something about which I feel very inadequate about.  I have never been very successful in the past in trying to find a lover, although I have had a couple of girlfriends for a year or so each.  First off It\'s something I don\'t have very much experience at; of the relationships I was in, one was a very mentally abusive one in which I was unable to deal with the constant need of my girlfriend to be right, to always have what she wanted to the exclusion of anything I wanted.  I ended up not liking her, I had  a hard time being a friend or even talking to her.  The communication was all one way.  The other relationship, I felt I was unable to give what was necessary to make a relationship work.  Her needs seemed to change on a daily basis and I just ended up feeling overwhelmed.Throughout my entire life I have had to deal with the fact that I have a type of muscular dystrophy, which, while it probably won\'t kill me, limits my abilities physically; enough to make me (seemingly) very different from everyone else.  Since I was unable to participate fully in many sports activities (it seems to be important in this culture) I was on the outside of a lot of things and was occasionally the subject of ridicule.  I think a lot of my pre college experiences sort of led me to the conclusion that I wasn\'t as good as everyone else.  I think more than anything else, this has always been in the back of my mind.I have fallen in love many times but It seems that the women I had strongest feelings for were never interested in me as anything more than a friend.  Over the years it has made me doubt my attractiveness to women.  On top of everything else, I\'m kind of scared of a relationship and maybe there were times and places where I have held back instead of trying to see if something would work.  Some of that was because, I was in love with someone else at the time (unrequited) and I felt that it would be disloyal to see someone else or the object of my affection would somehow fall in love with me once I started seeing someone else or?..  this has had many permutations but, I think it\'s all just fantasy or maybe not or maybe to a certain degree or ? Hell, I don\'t know.I think what I have done is create a cage for myself.  I think, in general, I\'m a good person.  I have a lot of good friends.  I have a great job.  I think I\'m making a positive contribution to society.  So what\'s the problem here?  Maybe I just need to be braver and not worry about other people so much maybe I shouldn\'t be so afraid to put my feelings ahead of others.My relationship with my father (or lack of one) might be somehow related to my problems with relationships in general.  I haven\'t talked to my father in more than ten years, since I got to Austin.  He has never been one to communicate very well, neither with me or my sister. he didn\'t go to her wedding.  I think I somehow picked up his inability to communicate very well and this is something that I need to work on.  I don\'t know when I might be able to start to talk to him again I feel like the inertia has built up to the point where it will be very difficult and emotional (probably for both of us) to start up our relationship again.  It\'s not as if I don\'t like him, he\'s a good guy, but throughout my life and especially when my mother and he got a divorce, heart to heart talks rarely happened. I think that somehow he was disappointed in me because I was born with a muscle disease.  Maybe disappointed is the wrong term, maybe he felt somehow responsible. it was not preventable and didn\'t know how to deal with a son who didn\'t fit in.  Was he embarrassed?  I don\'t know, but I think when I played baseball. several years I played organized sandlot ball. it was painful for him to watch me because I couldn\'t run hit catch throw like the other kids.  I guess I don\'t blame him for feeling this way but It seems like he could have made more of an effort.  He said he loved me and he said he was proud of me and I believe he was.  But he didn\'t spend much time with me on father son activities.  My mother told me his parents were kind of detached from he and his brother so maybe this was a factor as well.The problem is that now that I know the origin of some of my communication problems, how do I get on top of them?  It\'s kind of strange that I picked this up to such a degree from my father because, my mother always expresses her emotions, almost a complete opposite from my father.  Maybe this was a factor in their breakup.  I have to try hard to communicate on any kind of deep level with my mother because she tends to be very overbearing and wants to impose her views and values on me.  It\'s as if she still thinks of me as a two year old.  She has gotten better as of late but I still don\'t communicate with her as well as I feel I should, I guess because I don\'t trust her not to fall into dictating my life to me.  It\'s coming along though.Another aspect of my life is how I seem to have lots of good friends but I don\'t seem to spend much time with a lot of them.  One or two I\'ll hang out with a lot but many of the rest I haven\'t talked to in a while.  The same inertia that I feel about talking to my father is present when I think about  calling friends I haven\'t seen in a while.  So what is it, maybe this is fairly normal, but I like it when friends call me out of the blue.  I don\'t understand why I have this fear.What is it that I have to do here to make some headway on these problems?  Is it that I have to be brave and be willing to take the rejection when dealing with women.  I suppose there are some who might reject me for my physical disability and some for whom having a baby is very important.  In those situations it wouldn\'t work out but, surely that can\'t be all of the women I am attracted to.  I guess it\'s going to hurt not just me but possibly the woman I\'m interested in, but it seems like something should be done.  Some how I have to get through my head that I am good enough, even if it\'s just a lie, I need to convince myself that this is true.  After all I know a lot of really good people who have helped me out and who I have helped, and I work for causes that I think are important.  These are things that I will be proud of later in my life.  So what if can\'t do a 100 mile trek across the mountains, there are a lot of other things I can do.I shouldn\'t let this disease affect a lot of the things I want to do.  I need to take more vacations out of the state, alone if necessary, just to get a better perspective.  I think I hold myself back from doing these things because I am self conscious about the things that are obviously difficult for me.  Things like getting up and down from the ground or getting out of low chairs or couches is difficult and I feel kind of self conscious about that.  I think too much about what other people might think, if I have friends with me I think about what they might think other people are thinking.  This is obviously way too much thinking.  It sounds painful just seeing it in writing.  And probably totally unnecessary.

'I awoke at 5:45 AM and went downstairs to turn on the coffee that I had prepared the night before, I shaved and showered while the coffee brewed.  At 6:00 am I walked, half dressed, downstairs to grab the paper and a cup of coffee.  My 6 month old daughter at 6:15.  I got her out of bed and changed her diaper while my wife showered.  By 6:45 the other 2 children 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 were awake, my wife was showered and dressed, I was completely dressed and coffee and out the door.  I live almost in Georgetown, so a 40 minute commute is pretty standard.  Howard Stern fills my morning drive time.  Yesterday\'s discussion included more ridicule of Magic Johnson\'s talk show.

We walked and rocked until 5:30 until she was asleep.  I put her in bed with her mother and began my morning routine.  I turned the coffee on and grabbed the paper before I began shaving.  After shaving, showering, and dressing I sat down at the kitchen table for one cup of coffee and a glance at the sports page--specifically the box scores from last night\'s baseball games.  At 6:30 I ran upstairs to kiss the wife and check the kids, I left the house at 6:45.  The trip down Mopac via Parmer was much the same as always.  The same back ups in the same places.  I arrived at the office at 7:20, early enough that I could visit the inspection department before signing on to my office, I spent 20 minutes in the basement discussing field problems with the inspectors.  I headed upstairs at 7:45 for a cup of coffee and to settle into a set of plans (condominiums in South Austin).  From 8:30 to 12:30 I worked with a contractor from Dallas who is remodeling 15 Sonic restaurants in the Austin area.  The projects are very similar, but nonetheless each set of plans must be completely reviewed.  The gentleman was quite upset with system in that it takes an entire day to complete the process.When I complete my writing assignment I will check my voice mail one last time for the day.  I am meeting an engineer friend who is going to help me resolve a drainage issue my friend is having at his new house.  We will stomp through the woods to the creek with a 100 measuring tape and a set of plans to determine where the flood plain ends and establish a line where a beam can be located.  I imagine we will then visit with my friend, new homeowner and his wife to discuss our findings and the associated costs.  I will then drive back downtown and return my engineer friend to his car.  I will complete the 40 minute drive home, hopefully listening to a Rangers game on the radio as it should be after 7:00 o\'clock by then.  When I arrive home I will play with the kids until their bedtime at 8:30 or so.  The baby will stay up until 9:00 when my wife and I will sit in the dimly lit room and rock her to sleep.

'What really concerns me in my life right now is the relationship between my mother and me, or I should say the lack of.  Ever since my Dad died, about 10 months ago, my relationship with my mother has been very dysfunctional.  I do care about her but I\'ve narrowed it down to the simple fact that I don\'t respect her ant that coping with her type of sanity is a choice that I\'ve decided to avoid.  It\'s easier this way.  Many of her attitudes and actions that she has demonstrated to me in the past are simply not what I consider rational thinking.  She was always jealous of the kind of closeness that my dad & I had because we were more than father and son, we were each other confidant.  The only person we could turn to in times of trouble were each other.  We were the best of friends and truly enjoyed life and shared it when we could.  Then the good Lord came and got him.  As devastating as it was, life goes on, its just not as much fun.  My mother and I haven\'t had much to do with each other for about 6 months. She wont talk or visit (always says I\'m too busy) which is fine by me.  She has stopped treating like her son, so its real hard to try to get positive about even picking up the phone, calling her, and saying Hi.  Its stopped hurting because I\'ve closed up to this fact & being the \"don\'t fret about things\" type of guy that I\'m proud of and always look at the sunny side of life.  I\'ve grown not to let this bother me anymore, Life\'s too short.  It concerns me but doesn\'t bother me anymore.  My wife still has a hard time with it but given enough time, she\'ll blow it off too.  You see, distancing ourselves from this type of sanity of which we are not familiar with is healing in a way.  Besides since my Dad left, I\'ve got a new best friend and confidant.  I\'m married to her & I can\'t wait to get home and see her.Maybe I\'m too hard on myself or try to hard to be a perfectionist but its eating me up that things I\'ve done in the past are turning out not to be as I\'d hoped they\'d end up through out the years.  My wife wanted a vegetable garden.  I built and raised a garden along one end of the house and filled it full of dirt. Then to make vegetables grow better I thought a rain collection container at the end of the house, but the garden would be a nice change of pace for the garden (a nice country theme in the city) I ordered this 500 gallon cistern built a 2 ft. high slab to set it on, did all the plumbing and prayed for rain.  It rained, it filled up, the vegetables are to the likes of which I\'ve never seen.  But after 2 years of the cistern being installed, the thing is sinking. The slab is sinking, tilting, and now she got what I call the \"leaning tower of rainwater\".  It looks like hell and I don\'t know what to do about it.  I\'m no engineer but I figured 1 ton of concrete could support 2 tons of water.  Now after last night\'s 3/4 \" rain its full and I feel it will sink and lean even more.  I\'m helpless as to what to do to prevent any further sinking or leaning and what bothers me is why I couldn\'t have foreseen this, I mean, its only water sitting on a slab.  The only thing I can do is let nature take its course, but I feel less effective as I did before also a little humiliated and think I don\'t measure up to the guy I thought I was.  Its tough to swallow this pill but I guess its a live and learn type of lesson.  There are other objects and ideas that are similar to this but this is on the top of the chart.  I do know one thing, I\'ll never stop trying to outdo myself.  High standards or not, I need to do this to keep seeing how I measure up.  I figure, if I cease trying things to see how I measure up, I\'m afraid I\'ll cease to exist, which is not an option for me.Well, on Day #3, I suppose you\'ve been waiting for me to write about the topic of this experiment and discuss STRESS @ work.  OK here goes.  I feel that I have been given a great opportunity in being employed @ the city.  I thoroughly enjoy educating the public on how to do things (electrical things) safe.  It\'s a satisfying position and comfort to know someone is grateful that I\'ve helped.  But with the price of prosperity in Austin now, balancing who pays the price is tough.  I try to do the job to the best of my ability but trying to please the \"bosses\" and produce a timely product is not a reasonable or attainable goal at this time and to have them remind us of it weekly and daily is numbing.  I understand their position with push-push-push.  With this push-push-push perception of theirs, they\'re doing their job.  But who draws the line when push-push-push becomes unsafe-unsafe-unsafe.  My whole concern is customer safety.  If customer service lacks due to the fact that we are doing our jobs by producing a safe-safe-safe product then so be it.  I as try as I can to keep the safe-safe-safe product going out, it seems the push-push-push product is overshadowing it.  Its hard waking up and coming to work knowing my best isn\'t good enough for these \"bosses\".  And that I or we on the front line pay the price of prosperity and push a product through to calm the masses that might not meet out (the experts) standards.  It a tough atmosphere, but calasing up to all of that and knowing that the one who eventually pay the price of prosperity is the last victim in the line--the customer- So who draws the line?  Who watches out of the victimized, innocent customer?  The \"bosses\" run the \"masses\", that\'s their job.  Doing our job nobody wins, the customer gets a substandard product, we do the best, but it is rated substandard and the \"bosses\" get substandard results.  No winners, just losers.  The price we all pay for prosperity in Austin.  I\'ve always envisioned this rope, on one end, the \"bosses\", pulling as hard as they can to get the most of their employees.  On the other end, their employees.  It is the responsibility of the employee to pull back on this rope to do what they were hired to do.  Priority one.  Do what they pay you for to the best of their ability no matter who pays the price.  The customer expect the best, they deserve it no matter the outside forces trying to impede progress.  So yes, this job is stressful but if one knows it, realizes what it looks like, it can be absorbed, dealt with and excreted from one\'s system.  I don\'t worry, I\'m just trying to be happy.',3,-5,1,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,0,0,0,2.42,0,4.03,0,0,0,6.45,1.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,1.61,0,0,13.7,0,0.81,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,30.62,0,0,6.45,0,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,1.61,0,1.61,0,5.64,16.92,0,4.03,1.61,0,1.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.03,Male
'Relative to my work, which revolves around my new position as graphic designer for the City of Austin - position I\'ve barely held two months - my life is relatively calm. The environment is relatively stress free because I\'m comfortable enough in knowing how to do my work that I\'m not worried about being able to conform. The only frustrating element is that my computers are not configured properly so I am bogged down in not getting them to perform to my standards. My supervisor seems aware of the situation and is not holding me accountable for things beyond my control.This was not the case in my last position - also as a graphic designer - with the State Department of Criminal Justice. I barely lasted a year there and found nothing but traps set by my supervisor, for whatever reasons, to find matters to write me up on. It seemed I was facing the disciplinary action of the month - most of it patently bogus - yet still backed by upper management. The situation would have been more stressful than it was, had I not as many options as I had have. I left for this position just in time because things were only escalating to unpleasant levels and I was not inclined to work with the Sword of Damocles (termination) hanging over me. I was able to leave with a two week vacation and then start my new job.I recognize that my last position has left me somewhat insecure in that I don\'t want to have a repeat scenario. It would affect my credibility with friends who have heard the horror stories of the past year, potentially framing myself as the real culprit.Fortunately, I feel like things are going to work out okay with where I am so this is not a major stress issue. Any stress induced in my new position, I\'d come to realize, was being induced by me and I\'ve since let up.As this relates to my past, I\'ve always had to deal with issues of fitting it and the voices of repeatedly being told of how I would not amount to anything - from my mother (never my father) to my teachers.  I was told how I was different and either a loner - even a loser. I can still hear a couple of high school teachers who\'d told me I don\'t know how you\'re ever going to amount to anything every now and then.I\'ve seen how these voices could sabotage my confidence - and I\'d have to beat them down with defiance even at times when my confidence would falter. And I\'d become angry at how could these people be allowed to be in the positions of influence they\'d been given.I\'d vowed to not be like that and don\'t really get off on putting anyone down.At this juncture of my life, 45 - mid life if I live as long as my father (who died last year) - I find myself reading a book on the stages of the ages of man. I found the book coincidentally and am finding it insightful.My personal relationship with Steve (of 24 years) is currently in coast mode We\'ve been here before and there are no real issues between us at the moment - not that I\'m anticipating any.Our life has been a bit of an adventure. and we seem to be in a place now where we can look from the peak and realize that life is nothing more than a chain of events influenced more by things that we cannot control than by either of us directly.I suppose this could create some stress but, realistically, we\'re not that bad off. I just don\'t want to become complacent. There\'s still more that I want to do versus available time to do it. Write, for example. I have a story - my story as egotistical as that sounds - to tell and at least, I feel it would be entertaining enlightening to share. I\'ve had my share of foibles some which may be shared here based upon assignments in this study - regardless - if my computer doesn\'t get ultimately destroyed - I\'ve got it being stored: Word for word. Its good, cheap therapy, if nothing else.As I related yesterday, my life at the moment is far less stressful than it has been in the past. The previous five years have been comprised of a peak followed by many valleys then, with my move to Austin, two years ago - a rise - then two staccatos comprised of the unnecessary stress endured in my last job, the passing of my father a year and a half ago and my rise out of those valleys with my hope of this new position being the a lease.My father was always my hero and served as my rescuer on more than one occasion. Now, my partner of 24 years has taken on some of that role and I\'ve been determined to be more self sufficient.I\'ve found that - as the old Rolling Stones song goes - You can\'t always get what you want. -But when you try sometimes - you find - you get what you need. Well, that could be my epitaph. I\'ve always gotten what I need - pretty easily, in fact. I\'ve NEVER gotten what I want. I suppose, this could be considered a stress induce. The real stress induce is the replaying of unpleasant past scenarios.Like I said before, I\'ve always had a problem fitting in. I cannot pinpoint the specifics beyond other people\'s intolerance, and my comfort in being unique. I don\'t feel I go out of my way to wave the flag to the bull, but, I\'m pretty good at inadvertently pulling out the red flag, but for different reasons. Sometimes, I would mistake the idea that ANY attention is good attention. Life is certainly more interesting WITH attention, as compared to life without it.I consider life to be an adventure. and if one cannot travel the world which in itself may not be very adventurous one can make one\'s life nor interesting than not. In the process, there will be stress induces. Without the stress, there would only be boredom. For me, the boredom is more stress inducing than the lack of the excitement that comes from being in the thick of things.This is not to say that it needs to be a battle, or even a war. I really do want to be liked. But I\'ve been so much better at being disliked, that I am much better at it. If I am too liked, I almost feel insecure since it is such a foreign feeling to me. Regardless, I am trying and, indeed, it does take some work.I\'ve have found, that a quick wit is not necessarily conducive to being well liked. But on the other hand, I\'ve always admired someone, myself included, when the quick response can be delivered at the right moment. But, a sound byte can often be responded to as a sound BITE. And many people do not understand the distinction.When this occurs, and someone feels they are being upstaged by me, they respond in like, usually with cannons drawn, and I find myself responding like bear attacking the hive to get the honey. There wasn\'t any intention to hurt any bees in the process the bear was only thinking of the honey. The bees respond, the bear gets stress, along with a few stings in the process.I feel this is an analogy that works for some of those downhill spirals I\'d found myself in. Fortunately, my home life, contrasted to this and my partner was able to facilitate a change of environment. My battles in my last job were not to be par for the course, but were an anomaly because the battle was not planned, it managed to find me and the stories I could share could demonstrate that. Regardless, it came back to my fitting in. It just turned out, the cost of fitting in was not worth the toll it would take in changing to fit a mold I was not inclined to even attempt to fit. The previous organization, I came to realize, was not going to adjust to me. I, in turn was not going to adjust if they were unwilling to adjust. It escalated. I left. Life goes on. Life continues to go on. Does it involve stress? Less, now. Right now I\'m enjoying the lull. I have enough adventures on the horizon outside of my work environment that I don\'t need any adventures - especially misadventures - at my work.I\'m taking a short course in improvisation - 2nd week of 6 weeks - I\'m enjoying it. Its a safe environment to experiment in. Last night, after the class, a few of my classmates went to a bar for a beer. I shared with them a couple of my horror stories from my last office. They did not react well. They seemed to be uncomfortable with the subject matter of oppressive work environments, and said they were glad I was out of there. I actually had hoped to tell the stories in an entertaining fashion, but I guess I didn\'t exactly succeed.I felt some stress as I told the stories because my audience was not reacting the way I had hoped. I had hoped to show the humor of the situation but did not succeed. I recognize that my last situation was very much one that did not bear repeating from an experiential standpoint, however, I have not found complete closure to what I experienced there.In contrast, I asked - since I am nearing my two month mark - how I am doing - and was told I am exceeding expectations. My supervisor expressed that she only feared that I was ready to leave at anytime. I was surprised, and asked why she felt that way. She said the tight deadlines and all have been very stressful and may have overwhelmed me. Ironically, the situation is nothing compared to what I left and the past two months have not been stress inducing for me at all.I admit I\'ve been insecure - self-created, admittedly - because I do not wish to fail here for several reasons - some I\'d gone into previously: mostly centered on credibility. It\'s important to me to be credible. The set up for me now is to succeed or not be credible. Failure in this new job would validate the harassment I experienced in my last position, and reflect on my talents beyond here. There would be no explaining it that would/could be concocted as to why in reality it did not work, except that I was the problem.This consideration does weigh on me and would certainly more so, had my evaluation gone otherwise. Fortunately, though, this was not the case. I had not misread the situation, I felt I was doing okay and it was reassuring to hear that indeed my radar does not need readjusting on this new horizon.On the home front, Steve, my partner is the one who is dealing more with a potential upcoming change: He\'s been with a major corporation for the past 25 years and is being courted away. He\'s tempted, yet insecure. He views it as gambling with his retirement which he is and doesn\'t want to make the wrong choice. I\'ve attempted to downplay it. That he can do whatever he wants. He\'s talented enough to get what he wants, and my confidence in him outweighs his own self confidence.The best I can do is be supportive. God knows he\'s supported me during the past few crises I\'ve gone through. With all on the okay where I am now, I think I can certainly be there for him now.',3,-4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.98,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,2.98,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,0,1.99,0,0,0,0.5,0,1.99,0,0,12.42,0,2.49,0,0,0.99,0,0,0,29.33,0.99,0,5.47,0,4.97,3.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.98,16.91,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.99,Male
'I got up at 5:15 Monday Morning.  I put my clothes on watched the weather and left for work.  I always stop and get gas and coffee at Texas Star right outside of Jarrell.  I get to work at 6:30AM.  I start coffee and read paper till 7:00 AM then start work.  I worked on plans till about 8:00 then stopped and talked to everyone coming to work.  I start at 7:00am and everyone else starts at 7:45 or 8:00am.  As soon as the bull session was over I went back to work.  We have many plans to look at right now.  I was off last Thursday and Friday so I was way behind.  I had over 30 plans that needed to be looked at.  I don\'t have a back up so I am always behind when I take off.  I am also the first one in the system so I can\'t afford to be behind.I stopped and ate a pie and a coke at lunch and re read my paper.  This was from 12 to 1PM.  At 1 I went back to work and worked straight through until 4PM.  I finally caught up and was so happy I even stopped on the way home and got a haircut.  After I got home I read the mail and then went to the gym at school to see the new football coach.  I am on the school board at Jarrell and I like to be involved in all the sport things.  After talking to all the coaches I went home about 8:30 or 9:00PM.  I stopped at the convenience store and bought a TV dinner.  I put the dinner in the oven and watched ESPN until I ate.  I also got 2 or 3 phone calls like I always get since I am now on the school board.  After watching the 10PM news I finished eating and went and took a shower after that I went back and watched TV till about 10:50PM.  There was nothing good on so I turned off the TV and went to bed.  I woke up my wife and asked her a few things that happened that day.  After we talked about family things I just laid there and thought about a lot of little things and eventually fell asleep.When I leave here I will go pick up my son from basketball camp. After I get home I will go get my granddaughters and take them to the house.  We will put my dog, Little Bit in the truck with us and ride all over Jarrell.  After that I will open up the Gym so our kids can lift in the gym.  It is very important that our athletes lift during the off season.  After we close the Gym at 8:00 I will go home and probably make sandwiches for me and the girls.  After eating I will go over to Coach Sumner\'s house for a while.  We usually sit around and talk about everything for a hour or so while my granddaughter plays with his son.  Georgia is very active and I have to keep a eye on her.  He is the main reason I get up every morning.  She loves her Pa-Paw.  After about 10:00 Georgia and I will go to the house and I will put her to sleep.  She gets to spend the night with me every two or three weeks.  After she goes to sleep I will sit down and watch Cheers or Sports Center. I call this my key-down period.  Just sitting alone for a hour or so seems to put me in a good frame of mind.  I am so happy I don\'t have a school board meeting tonight.  It seems like they have drained me this week.At about 11:15 to 11:30 I will probably go to bed unless there is a good movie on TV.  Usually I go to bed and try to get about 6 hours sleep but tonight I will probably try to sleep a little longer.  Usually, although not common I will wake up my wife right before I go to bed and we will talk about things going on around our family and Jane.',3,-1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,10.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0,7.22,Male
'My life is very stressful because I\'ve got nothing but deadlines to work on.  Deadlines constantly, at home at work at play.  At work we have deadlines, at set amount of time to do our reviews.  If you don\'t finish on time, your late and the customer cries to our director that their plans are late.  Then the director instructs you to get the work done!  Which is another stressful thing because she is the one who laid people off in our section last year!, knowing full well that we would be very busy this year.At home I\'ve got little projects to do, or in the middle of doing more than one person can handle.  Now I\'ve got this big vacation planned, however, to go I need to buy a new truck to pull our tent trailer.  Problem is I can\'t find the time to even go look at a new truck let alone haggle over price and whatnot.  Money-wise a new truck is going to hurt because we are currently paying for the new tent-trailor, and a one year old car, not to mention the house payment.So I\'m trying to work extra hours to get my work done before I leave for vacation which takes time out of truck shopping and family life.I guess buying a new truck is more on my mind than anything right now.  I guess I\'ve been putting it off on purpose?  I don\'t know.  But I really need this truck to go on vacation, i really need the vacation to alleviate stress.  If worse comes to worse I could use my current truck and just hope we get there and back, but that would really be stressful.Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard at work.  Nobody here thanks me for it.  I could work a lot less and nobody would notice here. (customers would notice).  This is a crazy place, Austin is booming and growing like crazy, and we\'re short staffed.Another thing about my vacation is getting together with my family can be so, not stressful.  I can\'t think of the word.  Challenging I guess or frustrating.  Very seldom relaxing.  Why do I do it?Another busy day, after another busy night.  Last night I decided to tackle one of those home projects on my \"to do\" list.  It was putting together a kitchen curio.  I took it all out of the box, and the first piece of step \"1\" was broken, as well as another smaller piece.  It was late and I didn\'t feel like driving back to the store.  So tonight I\'ll have to do it.Today was just a busy customer day.  I had a whole lunch of walk ins.  Each customer has their own little problems and they want me to solve them for them.  I was also trying to train the two new guys on how to help customers, what to look for, what to look out for.  You see, if I approve their plans, they get a permit today, if I don\'t its back to the drawing board.Now, tonight, I\'ve got to take the broken pieces back to K-mart.  And mess around until I get the right pieces back, and then rush off to my softball game.  All this with two energetic boys in tow.  Why, because they wanted to go to my softball game last week, but it was a late game and I told them, \"I\'ll take you next week.  They never forget.I might try to get my wife to bring the pieces back, but I\'m afraid she won\'t come back with the right pieces!I still need to get a new truck.  The days are flying by, and my vacation is getting closer and closer.One real good thing happened today.  I realized that with these new guys hired, things will be all right when I\'m on vacation.My supervisor is a real jerk.  He\'s off playing army for two weeks.  Now if you were a supervisor and you were hiring two new guys, wouldn\'t you make sure they had a phone and a computer?  My didn\'t.  These two new guys were left hanging.  We\'re scrambling around now trying to get them set up, while army boy is collecting two salaries, and earning none, meaning he\'s not doing squat!  I\'m sure we will hear about his fishing or his card playing, or whatever when he gets back.  Asshole!Bad day, busy day.  I\'ve got a massive headache.  I don\'t like to take aspirin, but tonight I may have to.Lots of customers in the office today, little help from co-workers.  One co-worker this morning said that he didn\'t like the fact that I was helping him do his reviews (WHICH ARE LATE) because he felt that I wasn\'t trained enough.  That kinda hurt.  I\'m trying to help the guy and he\'s cutting me down.We hired two new guys last week, and like kids, they need training and help.  Of course, our supervisor is off for two weeks playing soldier, and the next guy in line set up these long meetings today so that left me, and these two new guys.  It\'s now them, but they are draining.  Having to explain every little thing, and deal with customers all day long and answer phone calls, and do plan reviews.  Too many irons on the fire.  I woke up tired today, so I kind of thought that it would be a bad day.Management has been floating around our section today checking on things.  Specifically a few projects that people called on complained that we were not reviewing fast enough.  That\'s crazy.  They say the squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Boy is that ever true around here, but only if you\'re a customer.  If you\'re an employee and squeak, they find a way to get rid of you.  That\'s why nobody speaks up when we have staff meetings.  Well that\'s one reason.  Another is because no matter what we say, they\'re not going to do anything about it anyway.  They\'ve already got their mind made up.  Did have a good lunch today. It was relaxing.  Tomorrow is Friday, that\'s always good.  This weekend I\'m going truck hunting.  I\'m just writing thoughts as they pop in my head.  The stressors at work are:1) Management2) work load3)Co-workers who don\'t work as hard as I do4) No recognition',3,-4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.21,0,0,0,0,3.6,5.41,1.8,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,13.51,0,0,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.9,Male
