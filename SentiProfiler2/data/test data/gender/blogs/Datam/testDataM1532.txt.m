FROM MTV.COM: "Twilight" stars Robert Pattinson and Peter Facinelli have told MTV News that their ideal director for "Breaking Dawn," the still-announced adaptation of the final volume in the vampire series, would be two-time Oscar-nominated director Gus Van Sant. An Entertainment Weekly report on Tuesday suggested that Van Sant ("Milk") is in fact one of three high-profile directors who have been approached to helm the film, along with Sofia Coppola ("Lost in Translation") and Bill Condon ("Dreamgirls").
