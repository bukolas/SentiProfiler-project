life is a sinking boat.

that nothing one does is right. gunning into a fight, one is a bull headed fool. avoid a fight, one is a coward. once sides have been picked, enemies are marked. if third parties start jumping in and giving biased opinions, there is no more room for mercy. but was it better to sidestep an argument that could will only get everyone's blood boiling; or was it better to fight fire with fire?


i have never claimed that i am a good person. i've always warned anyone, everyone that i am a bad person - which is the truth, black as charcoal, dark as the shadow of the dark side of the moon; you are disappointed because of the illusion because you believe there is a redeemable quality in this shell called me, but for every good, the taint of saidin reeks corruption to my weaves.


call me childish, a fool, coward; but once you pick a side, then you are my enemy. it makes complete sense, the world is simple; it becomes black and white. i am a simple minded fool. spots of grey should be cast to dark corners like refuse never to see light, and to be given to natural death.

break
Thursday, 18 February 2010
how many times must my heart break,
before it becomes but specks of dust,
and many a times should it be stabbed,
till pain can no longer be felt,
the countless falls i must take, 
to shed hope, turn these memories,
forgone of love in times past castaway 
into rage, and ire, and hate, become 
a storm burning, unrelenting in fury,
like the heart of a midnight sun?

why

why, is it not enough to turn your back on me,

       ...that you feel obliged to desecrate our past too?

The Song of Dionysius
Wednesday, 10 February 2010




can thou hear? the soft whisper cracks,
invisible fault lines pulsing,
the gentle tremble of mine core,
willing to smash into atoms,
to painful memories of careless
spoken words and heartless thoughts.


How could one so completely,
dictate mine emotions as if
mine soul is nought but notations 
to melody of ecstasy to anguish 
in but few clef tied in harmony, 
to the tunes of mine epitaph,
and dressed for dust and ashes?
