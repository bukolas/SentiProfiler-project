Hecate's Own is getting done. The rain hit, days worth of it, and damn near knocked me on my ass. I'm over a week behind where I wanted to be this year and I've already adjusted my self-imposed schedule to accommodate the suckiness that has been weather in the Northeast. 

Feh, as my friend Bob would say.

I've broken 50k and hope to hit 60k soon. Meat Grinding will then commence, then it's off to the Betas and on with Norwegian Wood!
