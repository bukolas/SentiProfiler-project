The END?? but how? -  When i first gave a thought for my second post... my ideas mapped to a world of possibilities continuing ad infinitum. So right they say "A finite world with infinite possibilities"....The world has become so finite that its very end is being speculated by infinite possibilities.

By now u must have rightly guessed(..aha that was easy!) what im talking about... ya ... the "End of the world" or the "Doomsday" or the "Apocalypse" or watever zillion names it has... the most intriguing, controversial, happening topic in recent times. I initially became aware of such thing some 3 yrs ago through a friend. Back then, it was hardly 1 or 2 possibilities i knew of... the main one being the collision of earth with some Planet X(also called the Nibiru). As time passed by, some websites and the media realised the immense potential of this topic with the amount of curiousity it generated in people and started fuelling their content with fabricated rumours, misinterpreted facts and incomplete analysis of events. The result? An amazing increase in the number of hits - a chance for these people to cash in. The effect? The already insecure people to buy in all the stuff and become more insecure.

My knowledge till few days back was limited to little awareness of certain prophecies and celestial events that i gained through mail fwds ,occasional browsing and discussion with friends(especially during exam time ;)) about the topic. With that incomplete knowledge, it was easy for certain people to almost come to a conclusion that 'the world is coming to an end'("A little knowledge is a dangerous thing" applies right here) though not me, i was trying to be optimistic( arey sirf 20% life ko jiyi ab thak...poori 80% baki padi hain! :P ;) ). Then, i started kind of getting deep into this stuff( atleast to write something substantial in my blog :P) . From one wiki article to another, from that wesbite to this website, from this video to that video... my god! the amount of space they occupy in the internet area is truly mind boggling and so is the content!

A liitle research into the topic n u can know that the date, the doomsday 'Dec 21, 2012' was very cleverly chosen. It almost coincides with the end of 'Mayan Calender'. But is it really an end? The Maya, a pre-Columbian civilization well known for their religious and spiritual culture, was also noted for its developed art ,architecture, mathematical and astronomical systems. Their concept of time was different from us. They developed 3 calenders and the last one called the 'Long Count Calender' is used to calculate longer periods of time. The Mayans are particularly fascinated by cycles and this calender worked around various cycles of time from lower order to higher order. The doomsday is simply the end of 13th b'ak'tun, a higher order cycle.There was no much evidence that it points to the end of the world. "The higher b'ak'tuns are yet to come" say some notable Mayan researchers. .Now y did they chose to end the cycle on that day?  Well as i told Mayans are religious and spiritual people. They celebrated certain celestial events with end of cycles... for them it was a change influenced by one cycle on another... the beginning of a new era. So,wat important celestial event is to take place at that tym...?

Well folks, even im beginnin to realise the immense potential of this topic! ;) ... looks like its gonna go for pages(n may be a book :P) . Im gonna take a break( n u 2 ...huh wat a relief! :P) for now... n continue it in my next post... till then have fun! live more! n get more curious! :P
