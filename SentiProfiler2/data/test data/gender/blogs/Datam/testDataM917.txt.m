I experienced a couple of true Paddy's Day on the Emerald Isle. Basically, it went like this. The night before, one went out, got completely rat-arsed, sang a couple of pro-IRA songs at the end of the night, and found one's way home.

On St.Patrick's Day itself, one nursed their hangover, finally getting out of bed around tea-time, then one went out for some more craic, pretty much repeating the antics of the previous night.

The thing was it was just like any leisure-time in Ireland. Nobody gave a jot it was St.Patrick's Day. You don't need to give the Irish an excuse to drink themselves into oblivion.

The only people who give a monkey's about St.Patrick's Day are everybody but the Irish!
