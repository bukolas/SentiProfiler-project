I'm writing in again...something must be really wrong with me...( just kidding)..
Hmmm....people she's great fun to be with....very caring...highly mischievous...hard core entertainer... 
I always associate u with Hubli...those days were so much fun...pulling each others leg..
The so called combined studies which were more concentrated on general issues rather than on studies... we used to talk the whole day in college but would still have a lot left to talk over the phone after college...n those rides on ur bike(spirit)...putting us on high spirits.. superb fun that was...
how much i miss all that... !!! but i'm glad that i was a part of all the fun ...
but what i don't like is u irritating me when i start telling about Maddy...i'm used to it though...i think i have covered most of the things..will keep updating when new things come in..
miss u loose....very much....
take care....
