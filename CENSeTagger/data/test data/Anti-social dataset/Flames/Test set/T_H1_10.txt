whats [sic] up Patrick Davidson (if thats [sic] your real name) your game sucks. First of all, there is no 3D affect [sic] to it at all so why is it called 3D. and every time when I'm kickin some ass, i die when I'm clearly not touching the side boundary. One time I was 7 pixles [sic] away from the side and I died.(bull shit) i don't know, I just think the game is a crock. I hope some day when you are driving seven feet away from the burm of the road and...............................GAME OVER. 


Please write back so i can see if you actually got this
