After migrating to Singapore and living in a world sans TV, if there’s one thing I miss about the small screen, it’s got to be the advertisements! My love for Indian ads started out when I was a very small and rather annoying kid. I was hyper all the time. And I used to play this game called “Guess the Adu” with my dad. It was pretty simple. Basically, when an advertisement began we had to guess the brand/product before it got announced in the ad, and whoever guessed it right first got 1 point. The first person to reach 10 points was the winner. I used to win all the time of course. (Truth is, my dad would play the game primarily to shut me up. Perhaps the fact that I threw tantrums when I lost also had something to do with my successive victories.) I’ve always found advertisements very attractive and fascinating. I even surf channels looking for new commercials. There are awfully creative ads (Saint –Gobain types) and there are some really stupid silly ones, which nevertheless, I enjoy laughing at. Then there are the oh-so-cute ones (like the Hutch puppy) and the jingles (Titan, Airtel, Doodh Doodh). There are also patriotic (Lead India)and for-a-cause ads(Aaj Tak). Ads with megahuge brand ambassadors, witty taglines, stupid taglines, no taglines and periodically changing taglines.  When I sit and think about old commercials now, I noticed I am able to recall the absolutely lame and inane ones as easily as the witty ones. For instance, I loved “Illathin yezhil vannam” ; the well-known jingle by Nerolac. I didn’t really enjoy the one by Nirma: “Washing Powder Nirma”. Yet that’s what came to my mind first. :O
