The end for a new beginning - Date: Dec 8, 2009
Location: Khairtabad flyover(over the Lake view park), Hyderabad
Time: around 7:30 PM

Vini and I decided to walk our way to the end of the flyover from Prasads Multiplex after watching the Arya-2 movie. "Movie antha pichollene babu!... Arya-2, 'veedu pedda psycho' ani pettalsindhi tag line... nene gani Ajay or Geeta  place lo unte epatiki aa Arya gadini champesi prashantanga jail lo batikesedanni!" and so we went on laughing over our silly jokes( no wonder we enjoyed the craziness of the movie) as we slowly walked down the footpath. It was just like one of those walks we have whenever we meet.. catchin up with each other.. laugh-chattin over everythin from earth to sky(n beyond too ;))..our lives..our plans...our future. For me, this walk though, was a special one. It marked the logical end of carefree lives we've enjoyed so far. Few days hence we were to enter one of the most crucial moments of our lives. Both of us were equally apprehensive and tensed. "I'm sure u'll make it..sometimes ur frens kno more abt u than urself" said Vini .. and I was sure that she would make it. Not knowing what would be the result of influence of external factors upon our future, somewhere inside we were guided by small amount of internal factor- faith.

Its been a little less than 2 hrs since the probable candidates have assembled in the JVC auditorium. Half an hour has turned into another 15 mins.. n 15 mins.. to 15 more minutes and so on. Unable to think of a better way to pass time..I gave a glance over the faces of people. Some looked anxious... some looked dehydrated.. some looked exited.. and few others trying to crack jokes and laugh to overcome the tension ( i was one among them ;) ). Nonetheless, everyone looked like the candidate who would make it. Watever little confidence i had was beginning to fade away. My head was turning into a pool of negative thoughts. I turned my head away and started adorin the walls and the ceiling. There was yet no word  from the authorities.

Meanwhile semester results were declared and not many seemed to care much (i'm the first person here :D ).. except a few who were worried if they got a 10 or 9.99 :P . In order not to realise time.. I started blabbering to my friend n almost told the history of AP since independence to 2 of my friends one after the other( Poor they!) Still  no word! This was heights! Finally, after sometime.. one of staff members came in n told us that the numbers were very good. Huh! wat a relief! Then slowly, one by one, these guys started coming in. There were rounds n rounds of applause n standin ovations to each n every person who came in (just imagine the trauma we went through). For the next 15 mins.. all i remember was clapping for every sentence they uttered. Then came the final moment. Names were being called out branch wise and  CSE came somewhere in... i  don remember where it came! too tensed to notice that.. but it came. Thankfully, the order of names was something which we knew and I was waiting with fingers crossed.
A few names later.... "Geethanjali M" .. there came the most beautiful name at the moment. I realised the importance of a person's name that time ;). The longest 3 hr wait was over.

After a long bus journey, I boarded another bus to Hyderabad. "The number u r tryin to reach is currently unavailable... blah.... blah.....".. I tried a couple of times but the automated voice kept irritating. It was Vini's big day. I called her house n learnt that aunty was in the same situation. After sometime , i called her again n this time she picked it up. Me-"hello"...Vini-"hamma, i got through".

We booked tickets for Avatar, had a nice Frankie and  started our walk down the flyover. There wasn't much of talk this time. We faintly recalled our situation few days back and  ufff! how safe we felt now!.Those crucial moments(apti n interview) we talked of before, ended even before we realised them. We continued our walk till the end  listening to songs and singing our heart out. But our journey, is not to end here. We have just embarked upon a new beginning ;)



P.S:  I will continue my second post in the next one :)
