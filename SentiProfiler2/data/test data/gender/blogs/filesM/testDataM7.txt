A great buddy to be with.
Never felt sad when am with him.
One more to say,he does always laugh.I dont know how and why?????(Anomaly characteristics).
Relished and enjoyed with him.
AAAAAAAAA JJJJJJJJJJJJ .
here goes my testimonial for viveki know this guy for the past 8 yrs and still remember the first day wen he joined 11th in our schoolhe is very friendly,helpful and a cool guy who takes things in a sportive manner and a good friend to be with...he is very good at french and german, he was our unofficial french teacher at schoolcant forget those days wen v used to go to his house saying v r gng to learn frenchand instead we used to play cricket inside his house ,his house was almost like a guest house for us where we get snacks and tea  always, we have spent more time talking to each other while playing in the ground rather than in school..those are memorable days and he is one of the few school frnds with whom i still have regular touch...hope we remain in contact till the end ... wishing him all the very best for his future career
.knew Mr. Jughead/Payasam through a common friend
...never have met him in person, YM has been the medium of communication.

Based on the limited interaction and his blogs, I would say he is a rational and insightful thinker. Sometimes, tends to get confused between tradition and US life or at least tries to analyze it a bit too much. 

Intellectual, sometimes my sounding board and a little caring.

John, hope the testimonial is exactly the way you wanted it to be.... :)
On a 'business' jaunt to Moscow for 2 weeks. Remains to be seen how the next two weeks pass by.
Have the following weeks to see the place. Luckily the weather is not bad 10 deg in the morning and around 0 deg C in the nights. Apparently, my hotel is in the middle of the city and so, all the good locations are nearby. Normally, I plan out what to do in such trips. Having come alone, am yet to look up even a Moscow map.
When I wrote that the first half of the film and the second half of the film are of contrasting genres – the first being a B-movie adventure (that works because of the chemistry and sexual tension between the trio) and the second half turning into a dark, Chosen One epic war film, I didn’t really mean to say that’s the problem.

From Dusk Till Dawn and Teen Deewarein are fine examples of completely changing genre halfway and pulling the rug from right below your feet. So I don’t really have a problem with a filmmaker choosing to change genre halfway. The problem is that the filmmaker here has no idea of how to do it smart.
Where do I start the testimonial for a very important person in my life? We know each other for the past 7 years and have been really really close for the past 4 years. First I thought she would be a person who is shy, unfriendly and stuff but later when we became close realized what a caring person she is nu.We have spent so much time together in the name of "combined studies" chit chatting about all the gossips on earth. All the last minute study at her house, going at 10 pm on the last day before the exam for xerox sema fun those days. Not only her, the total family takes care of me. Her mom is the best cook on earth, keeps giving me something or the other. Her sister has been really caring and the nakkals and teasing both of us do to each other chance e ella. At the end of the four eventful college years, the memories alone stand. We may depart, and chose a different career in life but the distance is going to make the friendship bond much stronger.
wat can i write abt this guy,u need to think a lot
if u wanna write abt him.A picture perfect for a college going bloke.
very childish in his own ways,almost evrybody in clg is friend to him.
first evryone said he's a bookworm,but whn i saw his pic(the one with coolers),no one will
say ever he's a padips.he's more than a book worm,a voracious reader,but his effects are limited to only
clg syllabus.Try 2 improve ur scope da.machan doesnt know anythin abt english muvies or songs,tht disappoints me.
being ma good comrade,i want 2 u sharpen things on tht.No matter u can ask my help anytime.
This little soldier has a gr8 future 2 come and i can see tht(this is gotto be the greatest lie).
Yes, you read it right, unusual things happening today.Like am posting more than a post on same day in an otherwise very much inactive blog, i also did a trek to Skandagiri.(Kalavaarahalli betta)

It was all decided on a conf call on thursday night.

Friday night 9 pm :- Dinesh picked me and we were heading to Praveen place at nagawara and went to Praveen’s place.Raj joined as around 1030. We were chatting till 1230 at his place and then started. The road going towards airport was awesome. Dinesh frequently touched 87 and occasionally 90+. Then we had a break just before Airport flyover and had tea. Started around 2:45 from there and started towards ChikBallapur. The road wasnt that great as it was from Hebbal flyover till Airport Flyover.Steadily went in 40-50 and reached the town of ChikBallapur around 330.[We were assisted by Google Maps to reach ChikBallapur, For those who dont have, just go straight on NH7 and after Devenahalli untill you cross 3rd level crossing,you reach ChikBallapur] We struggled which way to go to reach the downhill from there. Different people had different answers and we dont know whom to believe.Worse is more than half of them dont know that such a place exist. Finally we reached the downhill at 4. There we need to register for forest entry and optionally take a guide(200 Rs). From then on its walk walk walk. Initial enthusiasm lasted till 530 am and after that i was like tired. We sat and had snacks we had taken, glucose and continued. Finally reached the peak at 615 am looking for sunrise. But sun was late and didnt come till even 740. We had nice photo sessions and were chatting.Photos to be uploaded soon to my picasaweb. It was a well needed rest i must say and the climate was awesome.Wind was very strong.Completed all that we had bought and were reluctantly started moving down. Moving down was little bit of tough task as the fog had settled in and made the rocks slippery. Yours truly slipped at lot of places and at one place was saved by dinesh who had slipped just before me and was in a position to reach me easily. Then we moved down slowly and finally reached at 915.
The Invention of Hugo Cabret was one of the most amazing children’s books of the last 10 years. A beautifully illustrated book, told as much through its imagery as its narrative, it is also a book with a love for the early days of film, particularly French filmmakers.

The book won the Caldecott Medal for “Best Illustrated Children’s Book,” but I don’t know which Scorsese will make the movie. Will it be the visual master of “Raging Bull” or the talented hack who made “Shutter Island”?
Sriram aka mechsri is quite well known for his scholarly abilities & very much unknown for his inhibited mischievous character.. Knowin dis guy since 1st yr has been really nice.. we r all one close knitted group over der n d kinda fun we have together goin out for movies, budget dinner... not to forget d trips we had,, memorable one to mention was our adventurous trip to Tiruchi in d 2nd yr holidays, then our enjoyment at REC-T .. whoa whoa.. he has so many fans spread around d city, state & in d country (especially gal fans..).. We don't miss his treats every yr after he gets d merit scholarship.. so for d sake of d treat, v all pray for him!! (now don't hit me da)..
last but not d least ppl don't under-estimate dis little guy from his appearance.. he is as explosive like a small atom (in all sense)-- dat explains more about his naivity & innocence for guys n gals who think he is.. I wish him all d best in his endeavours & keepin rockin dude(PS among male peers too).. Long live our f'ship..Cheers!!
The introductory song 'Guzarish' by Javed Ali and 'guest vocalist’ Sonu Niigaam is soft and romantic. AR Rehman has achieved mastery over composing romantic number and this time also he has kept his promise and has been successful in composing an ear-soothing track. Tamil GHAJINI listeners can identify it is similar to “suttum vizhi”,which was the song of the year 2005. The second track of the flick ‘Kaise Mujhe’ by Benny Dayal as male singer and Shreya Ghoshal as female singer is exceptional. The pair renders a stunning duet. The instrumental version of Kaise Mujhe has soothing and balmy effect. The musical piece has right fusion of two instruments – guitar and flute. This song slowly grows with you after 5-6 hearings, it will touch your hearts. The third track 'Aye Bachchu' by Suzanne comes as a massive shock. It has English words inserted in Hindi sentences but sorry to say the album is not up to the mark and will not make to the chartbuster. This song is really disappointing as it has no thrill and one would never expect such a disaster from music maestro Rehman. This track has lower down the glory of the album.  I think the director has forced rahman to have such a album similar to “yes machi” song in tamil. Next let us see “BEKHA” An unusual song with erratic melody given to mood swings. This is the song where you can admire Aamir not for his eights packs but six different vibrant looks and styles. Rendered by Karthik, the song is catchy in appearance. Rehman has full faith in him and thus bestowed on him the responsibility of singing this soulful song and Karthik has done full justice to it
Latest high-frequency synonyms on Barron's for GRE: "shiva-thayir sadam-padips-total jolly-major flirt..<list inconclusive>" I envy shiv's devotion to wat he decides to do..be it kadlaying ,studying... He has many trademark quips to his credit including "sheni","I can wait for u all my life(!)"... Keeps humming some tune or the other and takes care no to change it for atleast a month(we've tried to debug this feature but it seems perennial..phew!) If shiva were to be in the periodic table,he'll be after Fe,Co,Ni..well i mean to say hes magnetic..amazing guy u'd want to emulate..
hmm......he has been one of my favorite seniors.......besht one ever.....AM PARTICULARLY JEALOUS OF HIS CHARM AND BEAUTY(but thats secondary)....his heart is wat affects people most.....the valuable advises he gave me.....literally changed my life a lot...really thank u na.....for all the supprt u gave me............he was someone who spoke to me in person.,pointed out my faults and told me how to improve myself and got me a good name.....brimming with confidence and merriness...its just enough to have him by ur side......u will neva feel sad...........he makes any meeting into a damn big hit....excwellent tabalist with magical skill....cummon na....go to classes again and become a maestro....i wasnt ever able to even a single fault with anna.......he is perfect in everything.............and one more thing...........his heart is as beautiful as his face./.........guys go for his heart.,................girls go for both.
"Rang De Basanti" is another interesting song which has a peppy-westernized-punju feel to it. It's sung by Daler Mahendi and the South-Indian singer Chitra (I had been to one of Daler's concerts in Madras and the host of that show was Javed Jaffrey. That's when I knew first-hand about the talents of Javed Jaffrey...he was able to keep the crowd in complete control with his jokes and anecdotes. In that he mentioned that Daler Mahendi should be called Dollar Mahendi - that was when Daler was at his peak).
Hoi monku or machi...I used to call her like this only...Always i like to fight with her ..for that i dont want reason also....durin second year only she became my friend..i have very little true friends in that she s very important for me.. she used to do stupid things without her knowledge afterwards she ill itself realize...she used to share many things to her mom but she will share everythin to me....her fav dialog" ethuku kadavul eppadi sothikiraru"....she wont leave her friends at any cost...she took part in all my worries nd happiness....
Pretty cool that Scorsese’s forst “comic book movie” is this wonderful, serious little picture book and not some dreck for Marvel or DC.

Like “Diary of a Wimpy Kid,” this book shows that awesome commercial success can be had outside of the spandex realm of muscle-bulging men having super-fights with each other. And it’s kind of surprising that Disney hasn’t inserted themselves in this deal because it would be an amazing brand for them to get involved in. This is a new classic that kids will be reading for years to come.
so saing about this female.........
she is cute ....smiles always ..... good english ....
but the only problem is that she walks like a gye .....

A full 8 hr theory day and u're forced to attend.Ur absolutely frustrated.turn around frm ur bench to see what the other side is doing 'Lakshmi' will be there smiling with all the teeth that exist .She's one person who can manage to laugh(exactly the same way - all 32 teeth) no matter how bad the situation is. Come assignments,observations,record,practicals and exams She's be there to help you out.Thank god she's in the same class as me.She's the only person who can teach me two full units in less than two hours the night before the exam.I dont have to touch upon already well known things abt her like she being helpful kind jovial and all that.But you want to crap (absolutely mindless crap i mean) you can keep taking to her.With her around you never feel the lack of a topic to talk about.she'll keep coming up with more and more topics.And Yeah YENGAL THALAIVI .The only person in our dept to have WON an election!she's got a massively wide friends circle and with her around its a laugh RIOT.CHEERS!!
Loosu girl.. Keeps messing her account and creates a new one every few months. One good thing is that i get to write a totally new testi every time (which has been due for 4 months i think) One of my closest friends from college. Knows even my deepest secrets and keeps them to herself which is the quality i like the most in her. Even after starting to live on the opposite sides of the globe it is quite surprising how we maintain close contact. This jantu could be bubbly one moment and get into the darkest possible mood within the blink of an eye. But, off late she has been showing great resistance to those dark moods even in times of stress. Great going anoo keep it up. She tends to be the person I call on when I am down and she tends to lift my spirits every time I chat with her. Dunno wat I will do without this innocent and cute little devil. Keep smiling as always
shanks a guy who doesn't fail to astonish people with his cool balance of life.. does "evrything" ther is to do in coll & yet maintains a cool rapport about him..! easily judged for a carefree guy,.how wrong can U be.!!! his GK skills ->>infinity. has something to say about evrything!!. uses !lol! at the most inappropriate places while chatting..lol.!!.. very outspoken.,sometimes can be very obnoxious about how he uses his word power...!!(danger..!!his vocab is a double edged sword !!)
His style of speech is somewhere between awesome & too good.(ithu podhum nenaakuraen..)
2 sum up one hell of a pirichivudals/ulitimate guy..!! lol !!!
he most accessible friend and saviour ever, is a genuine pal whose heart is much softer than it looks from outside ! He is a person who never was scared to tell an idiot he is one, or to call a loser a loser...Sometimes he is very very strange to understood and other times, he is just the easiest to read...A King of Kalaai...No one can possibly escape if he starts in full form...avalathaan...! On the whole, he has got every kind of hero hidden in him - sometimes a Bruce Lee, sometimes a Romeo, sometimes a Man of Steel, sometimes an emotional idiot, but in every sense, always ADHIRADEE ! ...and watever happens...jst shreds it off with "I Dont Care"!
A cool buddy to hang out wid...
i wanted to write this guy a testimonial for A long time...well finally....well to start he s a fine,chamin,friendly and a cool dude.....hey s good badminton n a cricket player...forgot to mention he bowls like mcgrath 2 ...i know him for more than 10 yrs and boy this guy could get along with any kind of person....i have nvr seen this guy quarelling or gettin into trouble with anybody....we ve travelled to many places together n can nvr forget the great time together...cheers man...happy hunting
I am one of the ardent fan of news channels and i always felt that its one of the  revolution of this century. But after seeing the happenings in the media coverage of "MUMBAI MASSACRE",I felt that these news channels are no way better than the politicians and they showed their ugly face many times..I would just quote few incidents here INCIDENT ONE: Lets go back to 26th of november,the day the terrorists started their attacks at the heart of Mumbai.If u had watched the news channels keenly, a man was deeply hurt in his hand and blood was flowing due to a terrorist attack in Oberoi Hotel. At the same time, all news channels were covering this incident..Wat they should have done??...they should have  taken him to the hospital,atleast they should have given some sort of First-Aid...But do u know wat they did.. A Reporter says "HELLO PLEASE COME HERE..PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR HANDS..PLEASE DONT RUN...HOW DID THEY SHOOT YOU??...DID COMMANDOS COME FOR YOUR HELP??.....But that man is under immense pain due to loss of blood,  but around 20 reporters  ask him questions,for whom a "BREAKING NEWS" is more important than a man's hand......Heartless people.....
so here i go.. writing a testi(for saving myself from the pester???!!!!!! :D).. anyways.. let me do it.. to start with she moves so very well even with strangers that gets her so many friends.. an then builds it all with her silly talks and dumb mokkas.. an acknowledges them too!! but the big prob in being one is she never stops asking for treats.. may be u must ask her how many she says are pending from me.. but all in all she is much more than wat am saying right now.. wonderful memories can only be shared wit a few ppl and she s one i must say.. talking as innocent as a child an doin all stuff behind is not somethin new to her.. an singing is onrthing that she s adept at.. an the best part is that she does wat she wants.. doesnt do something just because a group of friends do it.. good individualistic approach i must say!!! a very interestin character is all that i can say to finsih this off.. keep rocking dear mate.. 
P.S: yabbbbbaaaaaaaa.. inime escape!!!!!!!
It was Michael Muthu who had suggested Moulin Rouge to Denver. “That night, I took the DVD from him and ten minutes into the movie, I had decided to do it. I messaged Roshni and told her I wanted to do it. Unlike most of the other musicals, the songs here were already popular cult classics songs from Elton John to Police to Lady Marmalade to something like Chamma Chamma and I loved what Baz Luhrmann did with the colour and the costumes but the main thing that attracted me was the music.”
well here goes a rockin testi for a rock solid my beloved CHINNA THALAIVAR...one of the coolest persons i ve ever come across in recent times...never gets tensed for anytin...extremely frendly...so caring towards ppl jus tat hard to find ppl lik MY VIVEK ANNA...evaru oru DAANA PRABHU wen v met its anna who ll pay the bill...AN EXPERT IN GERMAN...as far as i noe after OUR GOD THALA its vivek anna who s an expert in AERO MODELLING...always wears a SMILE ON HIS FACE...i love his way of dressin n specially his shoes(really looks so dam cool)...anna nd i have deal too ... m gonna own his bike in few months time...loves to eat a lot n one thing ppl anna has a great sense of humour... yaarvenalum yengavenalum ottuvar... semma fun lovin...a GREAT THALA BHAKTHAR...i jus thank god for givin me a brother lik him...

KALAKUNGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Is there cricket on in Wellington this week? Anyone reading the Australian papers could easily have missed that fact in amongst the round-the-clock Michael Clarke coverage. Nobody will be happier than Clarke when the attention turns to the action on the field come Friday, when Australia begin the first of two Tests on their tour of New Zealand. It is sad that Test series between the two countries have been cut back, while five ODIs and two Twenty20s graced the schedule. But the reality is that over the past couple of decades, most Trans-Tasman Trophy series have been pretty one-sided, with the exception of the nil-all draw in Australia in 2001-02. It will take something very special from New
Mahesh is one of the most sensible guy i've ever met .. He's a very honest and a simple guy . He's passionate bout certain things lik cricket and always has strong views to express .. Brainy guy :) , very studious but has a poor memory .. does anythin for his frnds .. A very outspoken guy and doesn't think about how others may feel bout his views .. His vocab in english is very good and certainly is all set to go to US and pursue his higher education .. I have to mention that he's a very good fielder and has the safest pair of hands :) ... personally i feel its tough to find a guy lik him anywhere els .. nice havin u as a frnd da ..
Oh ! I have been holdin up for really long time jus to make it better... ( i hope this comes good !!!). Peddy Dog, a sweet little boy nxt door... to be really honest i ws upset with him initially cos he was simply takin all the lime light... then realised hw stupid i was !!! he jus bowls u down with his frndship... i have never seen a guy as sophisticated as him... a matured looks,a dignified way of talkin, tht thundrous laughs and those chweetttt songs he sings(til date no one knows wht he sings...)the nights we use to sleep together (literally) , the nerve hitting arguements, the winning moments in cricket.... ,mannnn i jus dont have words to describe those lovely lovely time i had with him... his place is jus blessed with so many nice ppl and no suprises y he is the same... if at all i culd cum across a wishing well i wish this guys jus keeps smilinnnnn... 
takin life as it comes is his best mantra to happiness... jus down leave me buddy u r jus SPECIAL !!!

Few years ago, an ex-manager of mine who happened to be a vegetarian had a customary dinner with one of his prestigious client. The client, being a very famous hotelier had taken personal interest in selecting the menu at one of his restaurants. My manager, who clearly didn’t expect the kind of hospitality was very embarassed to say that he was a vegetarian and proceeded with the dinner, without having a clue of what he ate. After the dinner, out of the ear shot of his client, he asked about the menu to one of the waiters. The waiter, who was beaming with pride on serving such a tasteful menu told him that the main item was an aligator. He had further told him that what my manager ate was the tail of the aligator, which was supposedly the ‘tastiest’ part of that animal. I am not sure if that bit of info pleased him or not, but he did realise that overnight he had come a long way from being a ‘pure vegetarian’.
Well I don't know where to start wid.I know her from her young age.In fact we were neighbours some time b4.I would always like to spend time wid her.When we got tranferred i missed her a lot.I didn't care abt tat b'cos when I come to tis Metro city I stay in her house or at leat visit her house.I like tat smile of hers(SECRET WEAPON).She owes me several things.Not only me everyone likes to be wid her.Don't get carried away by the written matter above bcos I'm her brother.Cousin of course but we never have such discretions.Everyone is free wid other.Good thing tat she has got a good job but it is nothing for her.HATS OFF!!! to her hardwork.Ennaku en yakkava pidikathu,ava sirippu pidikave pidikathu,yen avalaye pidikathu ana ithallam unmayonu ennaku bayama irukku.(Tis )line is especially for her b'cos she is a hard core MADDY Fan (MADDY(comedy character) he he he)

There's some simmering resentment still there for Norton, though.  When he talks about the character, there is a visible love for the full history of Hulk and Marvel Comics that isn't just an actor selling a film.  He's a genuine fan, and he has ambitions still regarding the character and what he could do with it.  But if Marvel really wants to win Norton back as a public cheerleader for the company and the character, the first step would be allowing him to restore the full 2-hour-20-minute version that Norton and Leterrier wanted to release.  If they put that movie out on BluRay and DVD, I think Norton would get much more likely to sign on.  His frustration over the way running time became a battleground on his film the same year that "The Dark Knight" became a phenomenon makes perfect sense, and I think it would be great to see all the other Marvel references (like the entire Super Soldier project subplot) layered back in.
"bodhai"-(I shall not dwell into the details of how this name came about, right now) is a very down to earth guy...very intersting person to talk to...that is if u can understand him and if he is able to hear u properly ;-).good cricketer and a good friend...sometimes mokkai but has a good sense of humour otherwise...is a great fan of tamil film comedy(like me),goundamani especially.on the whole; a jovial,happy-go-lucky and cheerful guy(er..i forgot the other things he told me to write ;))....three cheers for our friendship machi!

p.s.-it was during our class tour, one night he came to to one of our rooms in the middle of the night and started balbbering something like a drug addict...hence the name "bodhai"
Hi guys,

Long since I signed into wordpress.. Anyways I’m not goin to take much time now..

Yesterday I watched Poi solla porom movie.. Basically I’m not a movie buff, but part of project party I went to this movie. You must have heard about the story line of the movie through papers and friends.

 

While watching the movie I felt “Yes. It is good. Can be watched once”.. But, once I came out of the show and lookin back at crap movies and how directors unable to give stories spice up other things, this movie appeared to be brilliant. Kudos to the director, cause he shaped the story very very beautifully and had enough twist in the simplest of atmospheres. Really good movie..Worth spending some amount .. cause it does it’s prime job just entertain .. and doesnot  leave you in a frenzied state..

Meet you all later..

Tc and enjoy life guys..
I’m not good at writing, but I have written some poems and a few liked it too: O
9. I always had this illusion – Whenever I see a strange thing/person at a place, the same picture had been framed in my mind sometime before that incident took place.. Once I told my mom about this and asked whether i'm seeing future and the next day she took me to a doc :(
10. Though Being an Indian, I never wanted to see a hindi movie. The only hindi movies that I have ever seen is sholay, Lagaan, RDB and Taare zameen par.
11. I love my college (UG) and the 3 favorite places - Sports complex, Hostel and the Bus Stop.
12.  John Keats said “Thing of beauty is a joy forever” and its 200% true.
13.  My parents always said I shud become an engineer and I used to assume one who drives a train engine is called so and still I want to drive one.

It was raining in Chennai in the evening. The weather was delightful and people were having a great time. They were like the Hezbollah on hearing the words ‘Cease-fire’.

The crisis in the Middle East. Following calls from India and the UN, Israel has agreed to a cease-fire for two days.
What? You look surprised……….Yeah, was just pulling your leg. The Israelis don’t give a damn about the UN or India. They have just run out of missiles I think.

You know what’s the problem for the starving refugees in Beirut right now?
They can only have Juice for breakfast, lunch, dinner and have Jews for company.

Achu...the epitome of hard work..A person who is extremely sincere in all his efforts,a nocturnal bird who has almost conquered sleep!( almost cos he is lazy enough to sleep for 2 hrs in a day).a good basketball player and an avid follower of the game.Works brilliantly in a group...Some one I instinctively approach for any sort of help..Its a fast world..when people conveniently give lack of time as an excuse for most things,Achu has been my pillar of strength ..being by my side through my most difficult of times.. I am stopping short of saying a "Thank You" cos Achu will be the last person on earth who would have done these for me expecting something in return..Only a handful like him can ever exist in this world and GOD has been kind enough to let me know more about such an amazing person..He is very clear in his thoughts and where he wants to be in life.. and I hope ALMIGHTY gives me a chance to repay whatever he has done to me, by being with him during his times of need, as he scales greater heights..:)
Well.. whats new? Few months into b'lore and am already having more fun than I thought I
would. Couple of road trips to Mysore, one to Nandi Hills, one to Chennai and a couple of mountain drives in the near future. What more could I ask for ?

Also learnt poker - now, I am looking for a Casino Royale DVD :p - didn't understand anything when I first watched the movie.(Ill)Luck is always with me and my bets are always bad, but atleast, I understand the game now.
Maddy is an ideal friend. He is a kind of a person which makes him comfortable with any person. Probably i like him a lot because he reminds me of myself when i was in school. He is very sincere,work-oriented,dedicated..... I still wonder if he will change like the way i did?? He can be tentative at times But thats jus quasi state.... We have had like a thousand and more discussions on philosophy,life etc. It is always fun to talk to him. He is very good listener submissive but not too passive to the extent of being boring. 
he is very positive, driven and looks to improve constantly. But wen you find him in a group on a happy occasion you can see a different person in him. He is all out going and talkative. He should hav been my project mate!! After all the talk that started atleast eight months before :( However i always gets to be his friend. :)

Show me your friend i will tell about you na... i will probably pick him !!
She thinks she is intelligent enuf that she cudnt be cheated, but it isnt
Playing with this gal has been the favorite time pass for me, Kumar, Nazar, Babin ,Pravin n Alan(The best in business)
She just believes watever v say. even things like "Alan is intelligent" trust me she believed it..
I always hope that she wud shine in her life n set herself as a role model to others..
I wish her to liv the happy life as everyone wants.
I also hope that she gives treat to me n Alan althru the Life.
Never mind the Darkness ahead U can still find a way...
I have known Ramya for the past 4 yrs and she's one of my very good friends at SSN...to describe her, she is Ms. Cool, Ms. Confident and Ms. Theramai of EEE B. Has a great spirit...She always tries to give her best in whatever she tries, ends up with great mokkais most of the times... Often a target of bantering in our class...but she never has bothered about these and endures everything with a silly smile...Few could match her dress sense...pink, red, orange being some of her favourite colors...you could easily point her out in any crowd for she stands out with her color sense...Has this habit of using words like altruism, philanthropist, etc. often in slam books and testimonials and only god knows if she knows the meaning of these words...I have enjoyed her company in all vetti and crazy activities we've done viz tours, IVs, symposiums, so called 'operations' and will always cherish those moments...All the very best in whatever u do...
We call him Israelu. This wonderful man has changed, is changing and will change the course of my life. Not only mine but also the life of few others.(Friend, philosopher and guide) But, its so sad to see his taking a roller coaster ride. (Eppadi irundha naa , ippadi ayitten). He is an energy bundle and his capability to channelize it makes him great. Never gets disappointed due to failures and he can keep doing the phoenix trick over n over again....
His ability to socialize, move around with people and tackle situations is really mind blowing. He just manipulates situations and can turn things upside down. OH man!!!! this ability increases when girls are around.(LOL :-)) For his mentality and attitude he should have become a lawyer or a diplomat. Thank god, such a thing never happ... or else we could have never met. A nice person to let out your feelings and secret... Somethings are bound to happen which is not under your control for which u shouldn't worry. SO just live the moment..
Class 12 is a pivotal point in any student's life.It is the stage where one has to prove himself so that he has a good future in his hands.If he fails there ,then he may have to work hard in his college days so that he can live his better part of life happily.And it was no different for me.
I had secured 85% in my class 10 examinations at the CBSE level and my mother had asked me to take biology group so that i can appear for both medical and engineering entrance examinations.At this point i would like to confess that until 12 Th standard i didn't know what is the difference between an engineering and Arts college.I thought Madras Christian college was a good college and more over an engineering college at the end of my 11 th standard and i was praying i should get a seat there. Since i was living in town there were no great coaching centers like iipe and aspire in our area and the only center known around Tambaram was Arul institute and i enrolled there in 11th itself because a rumour was spreading that they won't take in much students 12th and only those who had enrolled in 11th will get a seat there.
The class 11 was happily passing by and i was just beginning to know every problem by heart in my maths book so that even though i dunno the formula i would solve the problem easily because that was my strength of memory those times. I cleared class 11 with a percentage of 90 and was looking forward to 12th and the tuition in arul institute had begun in late may itself and i along with three friends Bharath,Prasanna and Aravind would go together for the tuition.

It's been an awesome ride the past 8 years, purely because Shankar has been riding wingman with me through out. The similarities between us are enough to fit in a book sized similar to the Advanced Oxford English Dictionary and i guess that is what has made us such good friends. We live two minutes away from each other, were back benchers throughout our school days, and now study in colleges 4 hours apart. (the last point may seem out of place, but considering the fact that we both are 48 hours from home it makes sense. )
Non stop nonsense this guy can churn out at a moments notice. Has the ability to rip anyone's self respect to threads. I have been on the receiving end more than once and I'M known for my ability to dish it out. Listing out memories and times we've spent together will fill out like a 100 1024 character spaces, so i shall refrain.
Anyway cheers to you dude. Hope you do manage to set all your convoluted plans in motion and someday manage to get somewhere in life
m an extremely jovial person and like to go out wid my frnds...like trekking n wud once again like to go on a long trekking camp in d North...like travelling to various places a lot n m ever ready to go out for a vacation...even if im free 4 just 2 days i wud b immediately ready to go out n have fun..
u can say a total moody person...
a total foodie guy n know which place is famous for which food item to quite some extent...
And LIFE IS GR8!!!
Live it to d fullest!!!
For a while now, I've been relying on audio files for use as meditation timers. These files essentially consist of a recorded bell in the beginning, followed by a duration of silence, and another bell at the end. There are many of these available on the web, and are not bad. The problem is that you're limited to the duration of the files available, i.e., if you want to meditate for 45 minutes, then you need a 45-minute long audio file.Mildly frustrated by this, I spent some time this morning writing an on-line meditation timer. Simply set the duration, and click Start. You should hear a bell when the timer begins and ends.Here it is: Online Meditation Timer.Using Google App Engine and JQuery, it took me about 45 minutes to build this. That includes the time it took to prettify the site and type in this blog post. Gotta love simple, well-designed application frameworks! JavaScript turns out to be a great language for toying with graphics and visualization. This morning, I spent a few hours learning about the Mandelbrot set and trying to code up a working implementation. The link below is one of the fruits of my labor:Mandelbrot Set GeneratorMathematically, the Mandelbrot set is the set of points in the complex plane generated by iterating through the formula z = z^2 + c. For different initial values of c, the iteration can either produce a bounded sequence, or tend to infinity. Plotting the graph is a matter of placing a black dot for the values that generate a bounded sequenc
Look for Jeremy Dean's rolling artwork, Back to the Futurama, in New York's Central Park next weekend. Pulled by two white horses, it will be hard to miss this statement about corporate greed, consumerism, sustainability, and human pride. Look for more pictures on Flickr . And at the blog: Back to the Futurama . If you are in the area, check out the details . Run Dates: March 4th – March 7th 2010 VIP Reception: Thursday, March 4th, 9am-noon. Location: Pulse New York art fair Booth #C4 Daily: Thursday- Sunday 12-8pm Directions: 330 West Street @ West Houston New York, NY 10014 The buzz about Brooklyn-based Jeremy Dean's art project "Back to the Futurama" has now gone viral, with coverage in a wide range of online media. As regular readers will recall, Jeremy is converting a GMC Hummer H2 into a horse-drawn carriage to create a symbol of America's perilously unsustainable lifestyle. Jeremy has bet the farm on this project, so to speak, and exposure of the project will be vital to its chances of success. A big boost came two weeks ago when influential car expert and automotive journalist John Voelcker wrote about Jeremy's project under a headline that is itself an alliterative classic: " Hummer-Hating Artist Hacks H2 Into Horse Cart, Cites Hoover ." This article has already racked up 16,000 views and 285 diggs. The story spread like exhaust fumes through the automotive blogosphere and there are now over 100,000 Google hits for Hummer Hating Artist Jeremy Dean. The video that Jeremy made of the first cut into the Hummer has been viewed over 16,000 times on YouTube ( http://tr.im/humvid ) and more in Vimeo ( http://vimeo.com/8962281 ). Not to be outdone, the equine community has picked up the story, appearing here in&nbsp; Horse Journal . Maybe some cart horse experts can help Jeremy match power source to completed carriage. Of course, this story was destined for mainstream press coverage from the start. We now see the project making its way into the Huffington Post and it may be on Current TV soon (it's on their web site's Upcoming section ). When us social media mavens talk about something "going viral" there really has to be a global element. The story has to be covered far and wide. Well here it is on a forum in Russia . And getting from the East Coast to New Zealand probably counts. The story was covered there in the equine press . What is really interesting, from an art perspective, is the lack of coverage [so far] in the art press. When assessing the work of Jeremy Dean, the art world would be wise to take a tip from the film world. Conventional wisdom said Jeremy could not, as a first time film maker, make a documentary about race, not one that could be nominated for an NAACP Image Award. Dare Not Walk Alone did not win that award, but it did get a theatrical release, positive reviews in national press, a spot in Walmart's catalog and, on Tuesday night, there was an Oscar-winning actor in the front row for the screening at the Skirball Community Center in L.A. Immediately after the screening the actor walked up to Jeremy, shook his hand, and said: "Great Film!" Footnote: Jeremy's art has been mentioned on the influential art blog EAGEAGEAG but I confess it was me that did the mentioning. (Who am I to talk about art? Well not that it really matters, but I do have a minor in Fine Art from the University of Leeds. I started a Master's degree thesis on Hegel's Aethestics at McMaster University and a doctoral thesis on William Blake's Notes on Laocoön . However, don't take my word for any of this "what is art?" stuff, check out the New York gallery show in March and decide for yourself.) Jeremy Dean has started to blog his wild " Back to the Futurama " art project. This should be fun. Talk about life hacking and culture-hacking. This one is a real mind bender. A horse up front, an audio-video-enabled riding experience in back. BTW, if you're a business that has the skills and equipment to convert a Hummer H2 or Cadillac Escalade into something like the model on the left, and if you want a ton of free publicity, let Jeremy know. This thing is going to happen, and the result will make the news. There is a Contact link on Jeremy's home page . Update: February 1 -- Slick's Garage of Florida stepped up to the plate. Thanks guys! You Rock! I loved my father dearly but there was one question guaranteed to get us arguing: What is art? One of the great blessings of my life is that my father and I arrived at an understanding on that question before he died; not exactly an agreement, but an understanding. It went something like this: Art is not art unless there is some skill involved. For my father, that definition excluded a lot of "modern art" unless I could show him where the artist's skill came into play. Some 35 years have flown by since then, but I think he would agree with me that the latest works by my friend and colleague Jeremy Dean qualify as art. That's because Jeremy is creating art that cannot be realized without skill as well as perception, objects that have the power to make people ask questions and question assumptions, even as they impress with their physical accomplishment. I'm talking about the Hummer-Escalade-Hoovercart, the object at the heart of the Back to the Futurama project. (There are more pictures here .) I actually wrote a piece about this on my " On the Road " blog because it relates to cars and travel and life's journey. Starting next month, Jeremy is going to take a GMC Hummer or Cadillac Escalade and turn it into a horse drawn vehicle (the image above is just one of many models Jeremy has made to visualize the concept). Making cars into carts is what people did back in The Great Depression and in the States they called them Hoovercarts as a play on Hoovercrats, a term coined for supporters of Herbert Hoover, the president who presided over the worst of the Depression. In Canada they were called Bennett Buggies, after the prime minister at the time. They arose from a surplus of cars relative to a shortage of affordable fuel. Folks fould that one horse or mule could pull a Model T Ford quite easily if you took out the engine. And there was grass and hay to be had even when money for gasoline dried up. This project is going to take a lot of energy and expertise. Over the more than five years I have known him, Jeremy has proved to be an endless source of energy (the making and distributing of Dare Not Walk Alone being the most obvious proof). But now he could use some help on the expertise side. Not that Jeremy is a stranger to hands-on-artisan work. I have seen numerous examples of his home remodelling and he is a skilled craftsman, a practical maker of things built to last. So, if you know of someone who has the skills to chop a car, hitch a horse, or fit out the inside of a vehicle with kick-ass sounds and video systems, why not use the Contact link on Jeremy's home page and let him know. You can also pledge your support of the project (that page features a great video about the project as well as cool gifts you can get in return for your pledge). When March rolls around Jeremy will ride this creation into a major art event in New York. I'm pretty sure the TV news cameras will be rolling when this happening happens. How many people will "get" what this creation says about the world today, cultural values, lifestyle choices, sustainability and human frailty? I don't know. But this engineered weirdness will get a lot of people thinking. And that's art. . Wow! I did not realize it was THAT long since I had posted here. I blame the day job, which is often the evening job and weekend job as well. Fortunately that job is going well and I am racking up kudos for my blog posts on marketing. I am also getting quite adept at the social media thing. (Here's a link to a personal post where I rounded up 19 things you should do if you want to promote your company, band, film, book, profile). A lot of people are somewhat familiar with some of the social media basics, but it is how you employ them all in concert that makes social networking work, from Twitter to Facebook and LinkedIn , to your blog , your pics, your videos, your tr.ims, your stats and your Google Analytics (which reminds me, I need to add these last few to the list, maybe: Hey 19, Part 2, the Remix). What has this got to do with art? Everything. There may be some artists who seek obscurity (like the Buddhist monks in Shangri-La that were on PBS last night). But most art is intended to be experienced. And that seldom happens without a push from somewhere. Consider Jeremy Dean , the Brooklyn-based artist who created the indie doc Dare Not Walk Alone (that I had the honor of producing). He has been cooking up some cool conceptual art for several years now, but it was connecting with a gallery that gave his private art a push in the public direction. Jeremy will be showing at big art events in December and March and already has some cool art video online . Speaking of that aspect of pushing art forward which is often referred to as "publication" and/or "distribution," we are seeing the "and/or" converge taking place right now in technology like Amazon's Kindle. You can now read Kindle books on your iPhone and PC as well as on the actual Kindle device . Which brings me to the book I wanted to review here: World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War . This is a novel by the first "new" author I have read entirely on the iPhone. The book came out in print a few years ago and sold well. It is currently around #300 on Amazon. But the book is in several top 10 lists on Kindle, which is how I came to see it while using Kindle on my iPhone. I was intrigued enough by the reviews to download the free preview and on reading that I figured I would like the book, so I paid for the full Kindle version. There were three things that I enjoyed about World War Z . First and foremost I admired the extent to which author, Max Brooks, had thought through all the implications of zombieism (sp?). Then he extrapolated a new reality from a defined set of data: zombies eat flesh, zombies can only be killed by destroying the brain, zombies can survive under water, zombieism spreads through biting and the dead re-animate after infection, and so on. The book explores the logical and logistical end game. By doing so it reveals worrying weaknesses in current technology, science, cultures, and religions. (Hint, this is a global catastrophe of 2012 proportions.) Second, the narrative structure created by the interview excerpt device was refreshing and very effective. You learn very little about zombies or the war through direct description. You get most of it by inference. And you get a lot of rich characters too, which keeps things fresh. Brooks is skilfull at giving each a unique voice and strong presence, using little more than their recorded words. He also manages some great humor of the dark, battlefield kind. Third, I found this to be a fascinating book to read against the backdrop of the global H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic. Indeed, I think that may be part of the reason for the book's success, the series of epidemics the world has been seeing, coming from far distant places right into our everyday lives and forcing us to think hard about a lot of things we would rather keep to the back of our minds. I am not a big fan of horror stories, particularly ones that dabble in the supernatural. The genius of World War Z is that Brooks makes fighting zombies seem very real and anything but a figment of the imagination. Consider this: In talking about the book over dinner one night I found myself saying "If this zombie thing ever happened for real, it would be really bad." Talk about willing suspension of disbelief. The common element in stuff I've been reading and watching lately is this: It could really bring you down. We're talking about the suffering and death of millions of people here. So you've been warned. On the other hand, these are stimulating works, they might make you think a lot, and then you might have some new thoughts about how things could be made better. Then you could act on those thoughts and the world would become a better place. I guess we'll see. First up is the movie Body of Lies . Great photography and editing. Great casting and acting. And a gripping story without a cheesy ending. To me this film was drenched in authenticity. AFAIK, what you see in this film is very close to how things really are in the field of espionage, as in "espionage in the field" and the people who run it, both locally and remotely. As Far As I Know, there is this huge gap between remote agent and central office--the controller cheering his kid's suburban soccer game or taking his son to the bathroom, while calling in the kill--which suddenly collapses with a plane flight into the field. Then it zooms back into the clinical and chilling detachment of eye-in-the-sky operational monitoring and direction (with echoes of Patriot Games and The Bourne Supremacy but with great real world moral ambivalence). We are left in no doubt that local assets, people we turn when we pursue humint, are considered expendable, and there's a school of thought that says this is the way it must be. You rarely see that portrayed as bluntly as it is in Body of Lies. Second up is the novel, Timebomb , which echoes that same theme of the expendable asset, with deeper historical context as to how it arose. The action here is in Europe, from the UK to the eastern Soviet bloc, but present day, so we have disaffected Russians, Jewish mobsters, and Middle Eastern terrorists. Again the operational authenticity is there, but layered into the basic spy v. terrorist story you find the horrific story of a Polish death camp. And this "second" story is not pasted on, it is integral to the picture that Seymour paints of hate and fear breeding more of the same. The author of this thick but very readable thriller is Gerald Seymour, a former ITN television news reporter, back when that title meant you got a lot of experience reporting in the field (he covered the Munich Olympics massacre and the Great Train Robbery, and spent time reporting from Vietnam and Northern Ireland). Relatively unknown in the States, judged by a dearth of Seymour titles on the shelves of two different Barnes &amp; Nobles I have visited in the last three months, Seymour is a consistent best-seller in the UK and has penned a string of excellent novels. For me, his The Walking Dead A Thriller is the definitive novel about suicide bombing. One of my guilty pleasures on a trip to the UK is stocking up Gerald Seymour novels (not sure why I said "guilty" because "stupid" is more apt--I have to drag the things home on the plane and you can actually order online in the U.S.). On a literary note, these books rise above the "thriller" tag for me, much like LeCarré's work. Seymour's style is faster-paced but the depth is there. His trademark technique is weaving multiple points-of-view. There are no "main" characters but rather a half dozen or more people that we follow throughout the book. The fun part is deciding who's POV you're getting at the start of a new section. A rare case of entertainment tastefully blended with substance. . The last review is 1491 and there's an inverse relationship between the amount of truly fascinating content in this book and the brevity of its title. (Okay, so the full title is 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus but what I'm saying is, this book is stuffed with good stuff.) This such a good book I am now reading it for the second time. I don't read many books twice, so this is quite the accolade (others so honored in my post-college life include Gibson's Neuromancer and Count Zero , and Doctor Wooreddy's Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World , the latter having more than enough ironic content to warrant the long title). What I'm doing with 1491 right now is dipping into several different sections at once. It is a testament to author Charles C. Mann' s superb writing that one can do this. I can flip from the amazing city of Cahokia on the Mississippi to the dozens of feuding Mayan city states. I can read about the vast earthworks of the Beni and the sophisticated aquaculture of the Amazon, then travel via Norte Chico, a Peruvian civilizati
n older than Egypt, to the indigenous forest-scaping of the North Eastern U.S. And all the while I can follow the plot, which is basically this: America was a heavily populated and highly civilized land before contact with the Europeans. That many millions of people died as a result of European arrival in the Americas, either killed in conflict or killed as a consequence of contact, is now clear. This truth had been slowly emerging in scientific papers and publications for decades, but Mann has pulled all of the data together and the effect is almost overwhelming. I had long suspected that the sophistication and scale of indigenous culture and civilization was being ignored or suppressed. With a minimum of moralizing and finger-pointing Mann documents the whole sorry story. He leaves others to state the obvious conclusion: Americans of European origin stole this land and we did our best to destroy the civilizations that once thrived here. It took less than 500 years to erase tens of thousands of years of human history, hundreds of languages, scores of magnificent cities, dozens of libraries, and millions of people. I believe that many of the consequences of this history have yet to be played out. After all, the consequences of ancient conquest in the Middle East are still shaping events today, and our post-imperial ahistorical ineptness in dealing with them is still causing problems, some of which can be seen in a film like Body of Lies or a book like Timebomb. Watch and read, just try not to get too depressed about it. (Note: In the interests of full disclosure, all the above links are to Amazon through my Associates account. That doesn't add anything to the price but it means that this blog gets a small kickback from Amazon when you buy from these links.) Since Roger Moore over at the Orlando Sentinel mentioned the NAACP Image Awards being on BET, I thought I would point out they are on Fox TV, 8pm Thursday, Feb 12 ( check the schedule here ). And for those who are late joining the party, Dare Not Walk Alone is up for an award: Outstanding Documentary. The competition is stiff: CNN, ESPN, HBO, and an Oscar-nominated indie film, Trouble the Waters . We are hoping that the nomination of DNWA will raise awareness of the film, whether it wins or not. Just found this great list: My Favorite Things: Underrated Female Soul Singers . Complete with links to check them out. Very handy. Much appreciated Vivrant . Am now adding this to my "Things to do on the net when I have a few spare moments and some decent bandwidth." Update: Already bought Pleasureville by Lizz Fields. Excellent listening. Good songs, creatively arranged, delivered with way more soul than most highly paid performers can seem to muster these days. Some of the arrangements are unexpected, but in good way. Now have "Daddy's Cadillace" and "The Road to Pleasureville" on my drive time CD.
Today is Valentine's Day. There are many customs for Valentine's Day in the world, of course, Japan has an original custom. It is very very sweet.In Japan, woman tells man her affection with chocolate at Valentine's Day. So Japanese women buy expensive chocolate at celebrated shop, or make original chocolate by themselves at home before Valentine's Day. Therefore, every dental clinic is full of good-looking guys after  Valentine's day in Japan.And there is an another strange custom about Valentine's Day. It is "GIRI CHOCO" system."GIRI" means duty or obligation, but I can't explain the essence. "GIRI" is one of Japanese original concept."GIRI CHOCO" system is that women give chocolate to men who are mere friends, co-workers or classmates. This system helps many many lonely men. Of course, I will be also helped this system in this year...Is there a woman who gives me chocolate, not "GIRI"?
It's been a bit rough lately. With the economy in the tank and people not wanting to spend any money, I've had great hope that some places were continuing to move forward with their urban rail plans. But the opponents fight harder than ever because they see the threat or people don't plan things enough to go forward with any confidence. Just today, the list of articles that show how hard we have to keep working was a bit much for me to handle. Houston - The Mayor questions whether there is money to pay for two lines of the new five line light rail expansion in the city. Austin - The Mayor decides its not time to have a bond election to pay for a future urban rail line. Scotland - The company building Edinburgh's tram wants to delay 30 months after the rough ride they have already had. Tampa - Ballot issue for rail dead for now due to lack of decision in how much of the funding would go to the rail project. Bellevue : The city council is a bunch of morons there and don't want to run the line through a dense employment center. There is a ray of hope out there. The Mayor of Los Angeles made me feel a bit better recently when he decided that he was going to ask to get things done faster. Ask for a loan so you can save billions in construction costs and have something built for your money faster. I would like to think that is how we work in the United States. But sometimes reading all the news I do just gets so depressing. At least someone has suggested a way forward . Whether we follow it or not is up to us.

That's the scream of merchants and others who believe that a downtown without an endless sea of parking is not worth going to. But once the whole downtown turns into a parking lot it's not really worth much anymore is it? Yet we still see the discussion of parking dominate without an eye for the destruction that it can cause a downtown if left unfettered. Before Portland's miraculous return as an urban Mecca, it too was once infested by parking. So was the city of Houston, where parking lots took over most of the downtown at one point. Via Mike Lydon &amp; Transit Miami (Via the book City Shaped) Perhaps you can say how different this is from Rotterdam after German bombing... It's unfortunate that we didn't see what we were doing to our wonderful cities in the name of cars first. Europe had war, yet we dismantled our cities in a similar way in the name of progress. So much parking though, what has that done to the city's value? What has it taken away in terms of tax revenue from land and greater employment agglomerations? A study by Anne Moudon and Dohn Wook Sohn showed that offices that were clustered had greater values than those that weren't in the Seattle region. In addition to the spending on highways that expanded our regions to their current far reaches, how much real estate value did we destoy? Greater value for downtowns was lost and in the process we saw places like Hartford, as found by Dr. Norm Garrick at UConn lose population, employment, and their character.

From this angle you can see the crack is still very visible. This is not good and indicates that I still have a bit of a way to got before I don't have to worry about it. If I better healing I should have a larger callus, a bone growth around the break.Comparing these with my original x-rays, you can see that I have much more movement of the ankle which is great. Richard had a good feel of the bone and clinically it is all good, there is little pain and this apparently is more important, but because the x-rays don't show ideal bone growth its better to take it safe. I will still be hobbling around on crutchs and I can't get off base. I am however doing physio and already my ankle is becoming quite flexible.For some reason September is the month for birthdays, maybe its to do with the cold northern hemisphere winters and next on the list was Neil's toga or greek God party.
And if you know of any articles or blogs that are looking into this phenomena, I'd be very interested to hear about them.Thanks. Would you like a print? Go here. So, I had this little back and forth on Twitter with my friend Pete who lives over in Manchester, England, after reading one of his tweets-Pete-  Been sent an email with photos ripped off the web with no credit to the artists, stating creative people have "too much spare time". Angry.Me- I was saying last week that reading that line always makes me angry. Ignorant people.Pete- I don't wish to make you even more angry... but 5 of the images were yours and there's no watermarkMe- Can't say I'm surprised.Pete- but the title of the email was "Incredible Imaginations"... there's something :/It didn't help much.I come across that line far too often- "They must have too much time on their hands."  I'll see something really neat on the internet, and written somewhere in the comment section, I'll find those words. How many hours does that commenter spend watching television, surfing the internet, or playing video games?  If you spend 3 hours a day on passive entertainment (which is probably a very low estimate), that's 21 hours a week that could be used to write something interesting, make something cool,  or creating something absolutely nutty that you and some other people might really enjoy. If you aren't doing something along these lines, then I think that it might be you who isn't spending your time wisely,
A view of the windows in the room where Jose Roberto Arruda is being held in at the Federal Police compound in Brasilia. Below, a view of his bunk beds and office desk . THE political crisis in Brasilia continues with the Federal District Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police, a month after he was accused of trying to obstruct an investigation into massive corruption in his administration. The threat of federal intervention in the governing of the Federal District has eased for the time being, with the federal Supreme Court loath to intervene in a district that was given political emancipation only in 1988. Last week the Federal District Assembly voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Arruda. If he does not resign before the process is over, which takes several months, he could see his political rights suspended for up to eight years. Last Saturday, two district representatives tried to serve Arruda with the notice of the impeachment proceedings, but he refused to receive it, later saying in a handwritten letter to the Federal District Assembly that he wanted access to the full report on his impeachment before accepting the notification. The representatives returned last Monday with two witnesses to corroborate that they had informed Arruda of the proceedings against him, and served him with the notice. Arruda’s lawyers have been trying to get him moved to house arrest, something the Supreme Court justices have not been inclined to allow since this would facilitate his communication with supporters, and thus possibly make it easier for him to interfere in the Federal Police’s ongoing investigation into corruption in his administration. The governor is currently allowed visits only from his immediate family and his lawyers. His wife Flavia brings him lunch everyday, although she is not allowed to be alone with him in his room. He is being held in a room of approximately 16.8 square meters in the Federal Police headquarters compound in Brasilia. He had previously been held in a room of 40 square meters. He has access to newspapers and magazines, but is not allowed access to television or telephones. His lawyers claimed that he was being held in a “masmorra”, or a subterranean jail, which forced the Attorney General’s office to release pictures last week of his quarters which showed the room had clean white walls, a bunk bed, an office desk, a small refrigerator, a little sofa and a window. Arruda’s lawyers have also been claiming that the governor is suffering from pains in one of his ankles, which they claim is swollen and is linked to his diabetes. Two visits to a private hospital this week found Arruda in good health, taking away yet another reason his lawyers were trying to use to push for house arrest. The three-time former governor of the Federal District, Joaquim Roriz, who is now 75 years old, has been running political ads on television showing himself talking casually about the “shame of corruption” that is currently rocking Brasilia. Roriz is expected to run in the October elections for governor again. He has been embroiled in several corruption scandals in the past, which make his criticisms of Arruda extra ironic. Will voters here remember that when they go to the polls in October? One can only hope so. Jose Roberto Arruda, left, and Paulo Octavio in happier times. THE capital of Brazil, Brasilia, remained in a deep political crisis this week with the Distrito Federal Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held by the federal police for obstruction of an investigation of massive corruption involving the governor and at least 11 district representatives. Arrested on Feb. 11, at the beginning of Carnival, Arruda is being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police in Brasilia after he allegedly tried to bribe a local journalist to testify in his favor in the ongoing corruption investigation called “Pandora’s Box”. The vice governor of the Federal District, the enormously wealthy and successful real estate tycoon Paulo Octavio, took over as acting governor when Arruda was arrested. But he too has been linked to the corruption scheme, and impeachment proceedings have been filed against him, as well as Arruda, by several district representatives. Octavio found that he had little support in the DF legislature and after only 11 days in office decided to resign last week. After a hurried meeting with Brazilian President Luis Inacio “Lula” da Silva last week, he announced that he was holding off on resigning until this week, claiming that President Lula had asked him to wait a few more days. This was promptly denied by the presidential palace, which did not want the public to think that the president was supporting a politician under suspicion of corruption. Arruda was arrested upon request of the Attorney General Roberto Gurgel, who has repeatedly warned that there could be federal intervention in the governance of the Federal District if the local government does not get its act together. If the federal government stepped in, they would need to appoint someone to manage the capital at least until October when national elections are scheduled to take place and a new slate of politicians can be voted into office. The problem here is that the leading candidate expected to win the governor’s race is Joaquim Roriz , a former three-time governor of the DF and federal senator, who had to resign from the Senate in 2007 in a corruption scandal in order to not have his political rights suspended for several years if he had been found guilty. The Pandora’s Box investigation by the federal police came to public knowledge last year when hours of secretly filmed videotape was released by the police showing Arruda and several district representatives in different instances accepting large cash bribes and stuffing the money into their socks, underwear and handbags. The police claim these were regular kickbacks made over several years by businesses that had been given lucrative contracts with the Federal District government. These scenes caused a national outcry against such blatant greed and corruption when they were televised, although Arruda still maintains the payoffs were to fund the electoral campaigns of the politicians. Durval Barbosa, a former official in the DF government, who was involved in all of the payoffs, secretly filmed them in a deal he made with the Federal Police to help them in their investigation. In return he has been promised a reduced sentence. The Supreme Federal Court was originally scheduled to rule today on a habeus corpus motion by Arruda’s lawyers, but has postponed any decision until next week after Arruda’s lawyers asked for more time to study the original voting of the court which decided in favor of holding the governor. According to today’s Correio Braziliense newspaper , 13 of the 15 justices, who heard the original petition to have Arruda arrested, voted in favor of his arrest. A district representative, Wilson Lima, is now the new acting governor of the Federal District. He was described by Octavio in an interview with the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper yesterday as “a simple man”. What remains to be seen is if Lima can stave off a federal intervention until the elections in October, and if Arruda, Octavio and the 11 district representatives will be tried in court for corruption. For too long disgraced politicians in Brazil have been able to cry on TV begging for forgiveness and then make a political comeback several years later as if nothing had happened. One can only hope that the memory of voters in the Federal District is not so short that they re-elect politicians that have proven in the past how rotten they really are. THE HASTILY announced new security measures implemented soon after the bungled Christmas Day attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ( photo at right ) to bomb a Delta jetliner approaching Detroit, of not being allowed on international flights to use the bathroom one hour before landing in the US or having a blanket on one’s lap, were laughable despite the seriousness of the threat. One does not deny that there are growing numbers of Muslims around the world who are being radicalized and pushed into hating and wanting to harm the United States and its citizens. This is due to two reasons: The rise of radical and ultra-conservative Islam, fueled in large part by Saudi money, and the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. It is amazing that so many Americans still insist in solely viewing American imperial adventures abroad as do-good missions, swallowing hook, line and sinker the lie that America just wants to improve things in the Middle East. How can so many intelligent Americans not realize that in invading other countries, citizens of those countries just might harbor feelings of ill-will and resentment towards the invaders? It seems to be a logical and very human reaction to such a situation. Would Americans like it if Russia or China invaded the US to supposedly improve life for oppressed Americans? I hardly think so. The chorus of criticisms of the Obama administration’s reaction to the failed bombing were right in pointing out the stupidity of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s comment that “the system had worked” when passengers and flight attendants overpowered Abdulmutallab, and in slamming President Obama’s seeming lack of concern when he initially sent out advisers deal with the aftermath before finally holding a press conference himself. Napolitano had to quickly backtrack in the days following her inauspicious comment, especially when it became known that Abdulmutallab’s own father had gone to the US Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, months ago to warn them about the radicalization of his son. An intelligence report was telegraphed back to Washington from the embassy and the Nigerian’s name was placed on a watch list of half a million people. But he was not put on the much smaller no-fly list, and worst of all his two-year US visa was not cancelled immediately as it should have been. All passengers flying to the US have their names and passport details sent ahead when they check-in for their flights so that security checks can be made before someone believed to be a threat can even board a flight to the US. If his visa had been cancelled, and if the pre-flight verification system had worked, then Abdulmutallab would have never been allowed to board that Delta flight. It was the fast thinking action of a Dutch passenger which saved the day on that Delta flight when he leaped across rows of seats when he saw that Abdulmutallab was trying to set off a bomb, and grabbed the explosive device out of his hands, thereby saving the lives of nearly 300 people. Alert passengers and flight attendants on flights to and in the US are indeed the last line of defense between a terrorist and their success or lack thereof in blowing up or crashing a plane. The extra security measures announced this week for passengers flying to the US from 14 countries considered to harbor many potential terrorists with anti-US feelings, including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Algeria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen, seem unfair to me and are certainly not foolproof. Al-Qaeda or any other group could get around these new restrictions by recruiting disaffected American, French or British Muslims to carry out attacks on the US and Americans. Or they could use Indonesians, Indians, Filipinos or Chinese to carry out attacks. Americans and Europeans have to think strategically and cleverly in how to outfox the terrorists. Installing those huge imaging full body scanners at all major European and US airports would be a good beginning. They have hardly been used so far because of objections from privacy activists. But in this age of underwear bombers, these scanners have become more necessary than ever. Who cares if security screeners can see the outline of your entire body? Especially when the images are not stored and are deleted soon after being taken? Objections that screening all passengers with these machines would take far too much time could be remedied by randomly screening a certain number of passengers from each flight, no matter their nationality . In addition, Western countries need to be adept at sorting through and actually analyzing intelligently the avalanche of data and information that they are buried under on a daily basis. Firing a US intelligence analyst, who spoke fluent Arabic, just because he was gay, has to stop too. Apart from being homophobic and wrong, firing someone just because they are gay is silly when there are so few Americans who actually speak and write Arabic fluently. Western countries have to think outside the box and at the same time support progressive and moderate forces in Muslim countries so as not to alienate whole nations. Pulling out of Afghanistan would be a good first step. That war is unwinnable, and it is a shame that hundreds of young Americans and Europeans have given their lives for a country that does not want their help and an Afghan government that is riddled with corruption. And that too just so that Obama and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown can save face and not be accused of abandoning the fight. Afghanistan was never a good fight to begin with. Bush got us involved in that, Obama should now get us out. THE Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim and the commanders of the three major branches of the military all signed a joint resignation letter addressed to President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva last week over a proposed law that would have created a National Program of Human Rights and set up a truth commission that would have had the power to try military officials for human rights abuses committed during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. A sweeping amnesty law passed by Congress in 1979 gave protection from prosecution for any crimes committed by members of both the military and left-wing guerrilla groups during the dictatorship. This was the major condition that the military demanded in return for allowing the country to be returned to civilian rule. According to the O Globo and O Estado de S ã o Paulo newspapers, President Lula had an emergency meeting with Defense Minister Jobim on Dec. 22 at the Brasilia Air Force Base, where the minister handed in the collective resignation. Lula rejected their resignations and promised to stop the proposed bill from being sent to Congress. According to press reports, the president claimed he was not aware of some of the provisions of the new bill. The mentor and coordinator of the proposed National Human Rights Program is Lula’s own Minister of the Secretariat of Human Rights Paulo Vannuchi. According to the Estado de S ã o Paulo paper , the military was extremely alarmed that the proposed reappraisal of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship mentioned only state actors, and did not include the various armed, left-wing guerilla groups that kidnapped, killed and robbed during that same period. “If they want to put a colonel or a general in the defendant’s seat, then let’s also put Dilma and Franklin Martins there,” one active general told the newspaper. He was referring to Lula’s chief of cabinet Dilma Rouseff, who is his handpicked candidate for next year’s presidential elections, and the head of government communications, both of whom participated in armed struggle against the military dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s. It is obvious that Lula, the first left-wing president that Brazil has had since João Goulart was overthrown in 1964, is pushing the envelope on abuses committed during the dictatorship. He is testing the waters to see how the military will react. Their reaction was quite strong, causing Lula to backtrack and say that he and his Partido dos Trabalhadores, will not support the passage of the new law in Congress. But it is also a sad fact that the whole military dictatorship period of twenty years is hardly talked about in Brazilian schools or in public discourse. I asked several Brazilian friends if this period was studied in detail in high schools and they told me “no”, that it was just mentioned in general terms. Brazil is still suffering the effects of those years of dictatorship. Not talking about what happened dur
ng those dark years leaves questions unanswered and several generations of Brazilians without knowledge of crucial part of their history. A National Truth Commission, like the one set up in South Africa to deal with the aftermath of apartheid, would do a world of good to the country. Yes it would be traumatic in some cases, and yes, I think left-wing guerillas should be criticized as well, but I also think that confronting the many demons from that era would be cathartic and healing for the whole Brazilian nation. João Gabriel Vasconcellos, left, and Rafael Cardoso in a scene from Do Começo ao Fim I WATCHED Do Começo ao Fim , a much-awaited Brazilian film with a gay theme, on Friday night at Park Shopping, and was a little disappointed with the script and some of the acting. Directed and written by Aluisio Abranches, From Beginning to End is the love story of two half-brothers, Francisco and Thomás, who grow up together in Rio with their mother Julieta (Julia Lemmertz) and become lovers. The first half of the film shows the two when they are six and 11 years old each. Played by Lucas Cotrin (Francisco) and Gabriel Kaufmann (Thomás), the young actors are much more convincing and natural as the young brothers than João Gabriel Vasconcellos (who is a Ford model in real life) as the grown-up Francisco and Rafael Cardoso as the grown-up Thomás, who come across as being too self-conscious and thus irritatingly corny. The veteran actress Lemmertz is excellent as the mother of the two boys. She notices the intimacy that develops between the two half-brothers, but does nothing to stop it. Instead she has a heart-to-heart talk with Francisco and tells him if he ever wants to talk about his feelings for his brother that she will be there to listen to him, and that he shouldn’t be ashamed of his feelings. The director Abranches had trouble getting financing for the film because of its controversial theme of gay and incestuous love. Some producers offered support only if he made the two brothers heterosexual or if they became cousins in the script. He refused and was still able to get enough backing to finish the film. The director says he is not trying to raise any flags with the film, but that he only wants to tell a love story without making any judgments on it. Vasconcellos as the grown up Francisco kept laughing too much in his scenes, which I found annoying and seemed to be a byproduct of his feeling nervous and the fact that he is a neophyte actor. Lapses in the script also left me and other viewers wondering how the two brothers could live together as lovers and never seem to encounter any hostility from friends and relatives. Nevertheless, Do Começo ao Fim is a fine film that tackles a potentially controversial subject with dignity and compassion. — The film is being shown in Brasilia at Park Shopping and at the Academia de Tenis. Mounted military police attack a lone protester on the ground in Brasilia on Wednesday. THE embattled governor of the Federal District, Jose Roberto Arruda, announced his departure from the Democratas party yesterday at a press conference during which he read from a prepared statement. He did not take any questions from the press. Accused of running a vast bribery scheme by the Federal Police, video surveillance tapes were broadcast on national television showing him and several other political allies accepting wads of cash from private companies that had been awarded lucrative contracts with the Federal District’s government. Arruda’s move was a strategic one to preempt his former party from meeting today to vote to throw him out. He had asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to stop the Democratas from holding that meeting, but the court ruled yesterday morning that it could not stop what was essentially an internal party matter. In his prepared statement, the governor emphasized that he was withdrawing himself from the election next year, but that he intended to stay on and finish the 2,000 projects that his government has ongoing in the Federal District, home to Brazil’s capital of Brasilia. Some observers have noted that Arruda will try to hang on for dear life, but that the amount of corruption evidence against him is vast and that ultimately he will be forced to resign from the governorship. Anti-corruption activists have been holding anti-Arruda protests in Brasilia everyday this week, with the most violent one taking place on Wednesday when 600 anti-riot military police on horseback essentially attacked more than 1,500 peaceful demonstrators with their horses, billy clubs, tear gas and rubber bullets. Horrifying pictures of policemen ganging up on lone demonstrators kneeling on the ground were printed in newspapers and shown on television. Col. Jos é Beliz á rio Silva Filho, who was in charge of the battalion unleashed against the demonstrators, hotly defended his men’s actions at a press conference on Thursday, even after video footage showed him rolling on the ground as he tussled with a protestor. “Did I hurt him deliberately?” he asked defensively. “Our actions were perfect!” The head of the military police in the Federal District, Col. Luiz Henrique Fonseca, admitted that the troops under Silva Filho’s command had committed excesses in trying to contain the protesters and has opened an investigation into the incident. But he noted that initially he saw no reason to put Silva Filho on administrative leave. The Public Ministry of the Federal District took a less sanguine view of the incident, with Mauro Faria Lima, a public prosecutor, saying that it was opening its own investigation of the event by interviewing the injured protesters and the policemen involved. Lima said the military police’s actions against the protesters were “bestial”. “A protester that had fallen down was surrounded by policemen mounted on horses. The policemen threw their horses against the protester. These were shocking scenes, unworthy of a civilized country,” the prosecutor said according to O Globo newspaper. “We want Arruda to resign as governor now, in December,” one student protester told Globo television last night in an interview. “We’re not willing to wait until next year. We are going to keep protesting every day until he leaves.” There are six impeachment requests currently being evaluated by the Legislative Council of the Federal District, which has 24 elected representatives. But analysts have noted that Arruda has enough allies on the council to have all impeachment requests turned down. Warning: Contains spoilers! Spanish director Pedro Almodovar’s latest film, Broken Embraces , or Abra ç os Partidos , as it is called in Brazil, is not his best work. I watched the film on Sunday in Brasilia after the film opened in Brazil on Friday. Starring Penelope Cruz as Lena, a young secretary at a large company who occasionally works as a high-class escort to make some extra money, the film shows her father dying from cancer of the stomach that has metastasized. Her boss at the company, played creepily well by Jose Luis Gomez, is in fact the rich industrialist Ernesto Martel who owns the whole company. He’s a lecherous old man, who jumps at the chance of helping Lena when she calls him up to ask for help in getting treatment for her ailing father. Before we know it, Lena is his lover living in luxury with him in his large mansion. But of course, ennui soon sets in and Lena goes looking for work as an actress. She visits the office of movie director Mateo Blanco played by Lluis Homar, and sparks fly. Blanco hires her for one of his films and they fast become lovers. But I’m getting ahead of myself. All that I have just described occurs in flashbacks. At the beginning of the film, Blanco is blind and has been reduced to writing film scripts. He is taken care of by his agent Judit Garcia (Blanca Portillo) and her son Diego (Tamar Novas). A surprise visit by a certain Ray X (Ruben Ochandiano), who wants to produce a film with Blanco, sets in motion the flashbacks that tell the twisted story of what really happened between the main characters. Ray X is in fact the gay son of Ernesto Martel who wants revenge for what his father did to Blanco and Lena. Blanco turns him away and during a ten-day period when he is left in the care of Diego, tells the young man what happened so many years ago with him and Lena. It turns out that Martel agreed to finance the film that Lena was starring in as a way to keep her under his control. To find out if she is being faithful or not, Martel sends his son out with a video camera to make a documentary of the making of the film. The son trails Lena everywhere, on set and off, filming everything and handing in his daily shots to his father who watches them at night and employs a hilarious lip-reader (Lola Due ñ as) to help decipher what is being said since his son’s shots mysteriously have no sound. The secret affair unmasked, Lena decides to leave Martel but he pushes her down a long staircase and then drives her to a hospital for treatment. She recovers but decides to run away with Blanco to Famagusta. They stay there for a month, but Martel manages to track them down and sends his son after them. Tragically, Lena is killed when a SUV smashes into the car she’s in with Blanco. The director is blinded in the accident. The problem with this film is that I could not manage to care about what was happening to the characters in the first hour of the film. Cruz is amazingly flat in this film, with a determined look on her face most of the time that just makes her look like a gold digger. Homar walks around acting like an oversexed man going through a mid-life crisis, while Portillo just seems to constantly frown throughout the movie. The only character with some semblance of sweetness and naturalness is Tamar Novas as Diego. The other problem is with the script that allows Judit Garcia to tearfully admit at the end of the film that she helped Martel track down the two lovers and even helped him re-edit Blanco’s movie so that it would be a critical flop. Blanco hardly flinches at such revelations of betrayal, which was not very believable. All in all, it is sort of a relief when Lena is killed off near the end of the film, which does not say much about the quality of Cruz’s acting, the direction she got from long-time friend Almodovar, or the script that they worked with. LAST Thursday, December 3, I attended the annual Christmas bazaar of the American International Club of Brasilia at the Portuguese Embassy. My mother has been a member of this club for many years, so I decided to tag along this year since I had never been before. The club was founded in 1971, when Brasilia was only 11 years old. It’s original name was American Women’s Club of Brasilia, but that was changed a few years ago to accommodate the husbands of diplomats who were posted to the Brazilian capital and wanted to be members of the group. The bazaar was a slightly interesting mishmash of a bake sale cum jewelry and embroidery sale. Tables were set up to display the goods of both club members and outside vendors. I bought a beautiful arrangement of tropical flowers grown right here in the Distrito Federal in Brazlândia for only R$15 (around $8.60). I also got a beautiful watercolor of a cashew tree for R$80 ($46) painted by Therese von Behr, a talented artist originally from Romania and who has been living in Brasilia for many years. I also won a jar of Marmite from the UK in the raffle section. Unfortunately, although I do like the saltiness of the dark brown yeast spread, I cannot eat it because it will inflame the gout I have in my left ankle. What really caught my attention though, was the Asian section of the bazaar that had steamed Chinese dumplings, Indonesian dishes and a rice, kabsa dish from Kuwait. A Brazilian man came in bearing the Kuwaiti dish. I looked in vain for a Kuwaiti woman accompanying him and later had to laugh and point out to my mom that a Brazilian maid in a well-pressed uniform was standing next to the Kuwaiti dish ready to serve anyone a plate of the good-looking dish for R$5 a pop. “How typical of Kuwaitis,” I told my mom, chuckling. “They can’t even be bothered to show up, instead they send their dish with a maid!” With that we called it a day and left with our goodies to have lunch at the Gilberto Salamão shopping center in the Lago Sul.
A couple of recent news items caught my eye, one with profound conservation implications, the other without. The Department of Interior has been considering listing the Greater Sage Grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus - above) under the Endangered Species Act, and last Friday it announced its decision. Beyond their spectacle and interesting biology, Sage Grouse are notable for being completely dependent on the sagebrush steppes that covered much of the western United States until recently. As livestock grazing, development and extractive industries degraded these communities, a population of around 16 million birds has dwindled to well under 5% of that number today. Halting the grouse decline means maintaining healthy, virgin sagebrush habitat and disallowing the practices, essential to continual economic growth, that destroy them. The situation is a microcosm of the global conservation situation: meaningful conservation and the paradigm of continued economic growth are incompatible. This incompatibility is the metaphorical elephant in the sitting room of public conservation discourse. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar's limp-wristed decision last Friday, to assign the Sage Grouse “warranted but precluded” status (meaning essentially that the bird deserves protection, but won't get it, although its status will be re-reviewed annually), is a clear sign that moneyed interests will continue their reign and the DOI intends to continue denying that elephant. For more on sage brush ecology and conservation, see here, here, here, and here . The second story describes the rediscovery of the “extinct” Australian Yellow-spotted Bell Frog ( Litoria castanea – above), which hadn't been seen since 1980. Six tadpoles were collected and transferred to the Taronga Zoo near Sydney, where a captive propagation effort will be implemented. This species and several close relatives, all found in the southeastern quadrant of the continent, are rather hard to untangle taxonomically. The whole complex has seen a rather steep population decline in recent years, the causes of which are not clear, although chytridiomycosis has been implicated, as have chemical pollutants and invasive Gambusia fish. The Yellow-spotted Bell Frog's small range in the highlands of SE Australia is not well-studied, and contrary to the popular press implication, it was never declared extinct because the possibility of this news has always been considered very real. The discovery of this population, and the hope it represents for survival of this species, while happy news, tells us nothing about the broader picture of worldwide frog decline. _____________________ upper: WINTER SAGE GROUSE (1989) acrylic 14" x 14" lower: Photo of Litoria castanea by AP, lifted from the Internet The time has come, once again, for one of the country's biggest sale exhibitions of small artworks. Masterworks In Miniature opens tomorrow, March 5th at Gallery One in Mentor, OH. Among the 150 or so paintings on view will be my Red-breasted Paradise Kingfisher (above). _____________________ illustration: RED-BREASTED PARADISE KINGFISHER (2010) acrylic 10" x 8" I'll say it again: the paucity of good mainstream science journalism is more than regrettable. Science blogs represent the best source for intelligent assessment of science news, but sorting the good ones from the bad can be a trick. So I was pleased to serve as a judge for the latest Open Laboratory , a compendium of the best science blogging of 2009. It's now available in print for $14.50 or as a pdf download for $7.50. Few species have been featured on this blog more than California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus). There is no better school for conservation than the struggle over the past few decades to find a way to support these birds on a continent that no longer harbors much of a home for them. The recent trend has been a hopeful one; from a mere 22 individuals in the early '80s, a concerted management program has lifted the tally to nearly 350, over half of which live free in a sort of 3/4-wild state. Some bad news arrived yesterday, of the recent deaths of three members of the Arizona population. All three had succumbed to lead poisoning, a persistent plague in the region. The entire population was trapped and subjected to chelation therapy a few years ago, but obviously, more needs to be done. The Arizona and Utah Departments of Fish &amp; Wildlife are stepping up efforts to change the habits of local hunters, including handing out coupons for free non-toxic ammunition. _____________________ illustration: CALIFORNIA CONDOR (2008) acrylic 30" x 20" One of my perennially favorite themes is the taking of outsize quarry by predatory birds. I was recently alerted to a couple of nice documentations, the first describing an apparent case of a Spectacled Owl ( Pulsatrix perpicillata ) preying on a Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth ( Bradypus variegatus ) that had come to the ground to defecate. Spectacled Owls are common through most of tropical America, although I've never found a nest nor handled one in captivity and have little knowledge of their behavior. They're medium-sized forest owls that I've always assumed subsisted mostly on lizards, arthropods and mouse-sized mammals. A grounded three-toed sloth is hardly an imposing foe (unlike its rather distant cousins the two-toed sloths), but the taking of anything that big by a Spectacled is quite surprising to me. Our second link documents an attemped predation on a White-tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) by a Golden Eagle ( Aquila chrysaeto s), featuring some great shots accompanied by somewhat less great commentary, said to have been taken in Illiniois, of all places. While this behavior isn't typical, it's far from unheard of. It can't be denied that Golden Eagles are very powerful and effective predators. I have spent many hours watching wild Golden Eagles and have watched them hunt many different types of quarry. Some day I hope to witness something like this in person. While on the subject of large prey, I received an email yesterday with a series of photographs showing a Black-headed Python ( Aspidites melanocephalus ) swallowing what appears to be a dull-colored Gould's Monitor ( Varanus gouldii ). The email identified the location as Cloudbreak, Arizona, although it's clearly Australia. These photos may not be new, but they were of special interest to me, since they illustrate a situation similar to the one I painted in 1994 for the cover of Brian Kend's Pythons of Australia . My painting was criticized for showing the snake applying its belly to the prey instead the sides of its body. Some of the photographs, like the one in the upper left, clearly show the python using its sides, while in others the belly is against the prey. The entire photo series appears to show the process at a later stage than my painting (the prey seems to have already been killed in the former), but hope remains that Kend's book cover may actually be somewhat accurate. _____________________ upper: SPECTACLED OWL (2009) acrylic 10" x 8" I was asked the other day about the veracity of the cover of my book, Rigor Vitae . The painting (above) shows a trio of African Softshell Turtles ( Trionyx triunguis ) startled from their perch atop the back of a Hippopotamus ( Hippopotamus amphibius ) that appears to be lurching in a threatening way towards an unknown target. So how representative of reality is this painting? I can best answer this question be retracing my thinking in its conception. The adjectives that spring to mind when I think of softshell turtles are: active, fast, graceful, and above all, intelligent (as turtles go). The species T. triunguis is one of the smartest of the bunch; observations in both wild and captive specimens have shown they can spend over half their waking time engaged in play behavior. Even though this consists of underwater, hunting-related exercises, the knowledge inspired me to approach the piece with an air of whimsy. In my work, I nearly always try to deal with truths of natural history, but different truths call for different approaches. More often than not, the approach is a direct sort of story-telling that's not difficult to understand. When I invent a situation I've never seen nor heard of, biological credibility is an important consideration. The initial idea of this painting, African Softshells basking on a Hippo, is just such a situation, and the placing of my protagonists on that platform was done with a clear conscience. Although they spend a great deal of time basking, I don't feel that this static activity defines softshells' essence well at all. The painting called for fury and for speed, so I set the whole thing in motion, in that instant of my initial basking concept's irrevocable replacement with an absent hippo and the turtles returned to their brisk native depths. Caught in midair, the main subject's placement strains the limits of credibility, especially considering the fact he'd be more likely to favor a quick downward slide. In placing him, I tried to find the highest conceivable point such a reptile could reach if all factors of friction and inertia could be favorably aligned. The entire composition is built around enforcing the painting's movement: the surface ripples, the Papyrus stems, the flock of St. Helena Waxbills, and a mysterious arc of water all cooperate in a scene theoretically possible, yet so unlikely as to disqualify it as an illustration of animal behavior. But is it a betrayal of my “natural history truth” objective? I answer with a firm “No.” Exaggerated, contrived and skewed, I could never create a painting containing more truth about African Softshells. Anthropomorphism is a present danger whenever engaging in such exaggeration. My rule of thumb is to take care when when comparing a non-human's behavior to my own, but when the situation is reversed to throw caution to the wind. Emotions and instincts are identical in some cases, analogous in the rest, and indulging instincts accords a certain satisfaction. In Call of the Monsoon (above), a Couch's Spadefoot ( Scaphiopus couchii ) rises from subterranean summertime torpor to feed and breed in the monsoon moisture. Again, the subject's position here is anatomically possible, yet not typical, even a bit exaggerated: a bit like a purring cat. The intent is to stretch the immediate truth a bit to express a greater truth than a photographic representation could, without falling into the mire of anthropomorphism. _____________________ upper: HIPPOPOTAMUS &amp; NILE SOFTSHELL TURTLES (1995) acrylic 20" x 30" lower: CALL OF THE MONSOON--COUCH'S SPADEFOOT (1996) acrylic 18" x 12" WHO PUT THE "GATE" IN THE CLIMATEGATE? Memories of the Copenhagen climate summit have dissipated with the contrails of the jets carrying the delegates back home, but the public discourse continues. For now we put the important talk on hold in favor of a silly strawman: the debate over climatological data. Special thanks to my right-wing pals D, J and S for keeping me abreast of the latest articles, blog posts and email forwards making the case that the evidence showing a general anthropogenic warming of the earth over the past 50 years is a hoax, disingenuously cobbled together by various entities of bad intent. Over the past year, I've studied their arguments, and regret to report that it's pretty weak stuff, misunderstanding the research at best, but more often intentionally misrepresenting it to support the preconceived resolution that the earth's climate is not warming, and even if it was, it wasn't caused by humans, and even if it was, it would make things better, not worse. I have a few arguments with the major voices on the other side, too, and will voice those in future posts, but for now, let's ask how we can get past this argument and why we haven't yet. Any discussion of climate change has policy implications, and it's only natural for one's political desires to color one's sight. Also, climatology is a difficult science to understand, involving lots of sophisticated statistics, and understanding it takes some work. Most science is sort of like looking at a yard through a picket fence; you can get a fairly good idea of what's back there, but you have to make some assumptions about what you can't see, some of which will likely be wrong. Looking through a single gap will yield a false impression. It can be tempting to consider each gap, seeking the one that best represents your assumptions about the yard, but that's a sure recipe for self-delusion. Only by taking them all into consideration will you approach a true understanding. Last, the sad paucity of good science journalism makes it extremely hard for us layfolks to keep up. I keep waiting for Science or Nature or even the Journal of Applied Meteorology to turn up on the racks at the local Barnes &amp; Noble, to no avail. Peer-reviewed science journals, like Medieval bibles, are not meant for proletariat eyes. As an example of mainstream science journalism at its worst, I offer a tidbit from last Sunday's Daily Mail , the UK's 2 nd most widely-read daily paper. It describes a BBC interview with Phil Jones, the director of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU), the group whose emails were hacked and made public on the eve of the international climate summit in Copenhagen. For those interested in wading through them, the emails can be accessed here . The evidence in these emails has been heralded as a “smoking gun,” proving the following wrongdoing by CRU researchers: 1. Attempting to bar research conflicting with their own from peer-reviewed journals. 2. Hiding incriminating evidence. 3. Manipulating data showing a cooling trend to make that trend disappear. Without going into depth, I'll just say that #1 was clearly discussed, although there's no evidence any action was ever taken. The evidence for #2 looks fairly damning—exactly what was deleted and what, if any, rules were broken remains unclear, at least to me. Jones says it was done out of frustration with a deluge of FOI requests that were impeding the actual work of the laboratory. The evidence for #3 is extremely weak, and can be interpreted in many ways. Overall, “Climategate,” as it's been dubbed, falls far short of discrediting any of the CRU's work, much less climatology in general. I hope you can take the time to read the Daily Mail article along with the original interview it claims to describe. While the Daily Mail headline states that Dr. Jones “admits there has been no global warming since 1995,” what he clearly says is that the data for that period are insufficient to make statistical sense of. Imagine a white wall with three small chips in its paint. Two chips show blue paint underneath, one shows red paint. Your data suggest that more of the wall is blue than red, but you have no idea what the true ratio is. This is the climatologist's dilemma. The CRU data appear to suggest a small warming trend from 1995 to the present and a small cooling trend from 2002 to the present, but they have no idea what color that wall is. (Data from other groups, such as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , show slightly higher temperatures, but are still statistically insignificant when isolated). The Daily Mail article also misrepresents Jones' statements about the “Medieval Warming Period” as well as incorrectly suggesting that the CRU's surface temperature data were used to assemble the paleoclimatic model represented in the famous IPCC “hockey-stick graph.” It's hard to attribute the libelous errors in this article to a writer's inability to understand his subject. This isn't journalism, it isn't opinion. It's propaganda intended not to enlighten but to deceive. It's disheartening to see more and more of this from mainstream news organizations, and to realize that more eyes will read the bogus Daily Mail story than the interview it misrepresents. Climatologists simply try to understand the systems they study; it's plain to see from which side the real climatology hoax is perpetrated. _____________________ illustration: LESSER FLAMINGOS (2005) oil on canvas 72" x 96" At a party a couple of weeks back, I got into a discussion with an “evolution skeptic,” who trotted out that aggravating old line tha
 evolution was only a “theory.” He, it seemed, was holding out for the day that the theory would be passed into “law.” This inspired me to offer a humble birthday present to good old Charles Darwin on his 201 st birthday: A very quick, very unsophisticated primer on the difference between theory and a law. A law is basically an observation of nature, and a theory explains an observation. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation described the force of gravity, and his Theory of Gravitation, which has largely been superseded by Einsteins Theory of General Relativity, attempted to explain it. In this manner, the Law of Evolution could be stated that organisms change morphologically over time. Darwin's Theory of Mutation and Natural Selection explains the mechanics of that change. Theories don't become laws, they modify them. Class dismissed. Illustrating this post is a new painting of a Red-bellied Paradise Kingfisher ( Tanysiptera nympha ), one of six members of a New Guinean complex of streamer-tailed forest birds. It was in this region that Alfred Russell Wallace saw such simple island speciation and began to understand how it worked, just as speciation on the Galapagos awakened Darwin to the same ideas. _____________________ illustration: RED-BELLIED PARADISE KINGFISHER (2010) acrylic on clay board 10" x 8"

I'm not usually a big fan of 'making of' videos - if I wanted to have the daylight poured in on magic, I'd buy myself a periscope and a ladder, and most album-making is like most other album-making - but Solex have come up with something a bit beyond the norm to promote their Solex VS Cristina Martinez & Jon Spencer Amsterdam Throwdown King Street Showdown thing . This, to be precise, is what they've come up with: Solex VS Cristina Martinez & Jon Spencer Comic Video from Bronzerat Records on Vimeo .

Steve Albini is still producing for her. Better than that: there's a promise of a UK tour - brief, but with a fuller programme to come this Autumn. New-ish Placebo drummer Steve Forrest nearly set himself up for a sit com moment thanks to a scant knowledge of late 90s British androgopop : Yes, he tells my paper from Sydney, Australia, where Placebo were touring recently, he even thought lead androgynous singer Brian Molko, 37, was a girl. He recalls: "My tour manager played a Placebo CD and I said, 'This chick's cool. She has a really good voice'." It was only later, when Forrest met Molko in person, that he realised Molko is a guy. ... and only then after two or three weeks, when he realised he peed standing up. It says here. You'd have to think that Molko would probably be flattered and delighted if someone thought he was an actual girl. Providing it wasn't an ugly girl. Well, given that people are less keen on buying albums these days, you do need to have a second string to your bow. Will Oldham has just launched a limited-edition bottle stopper : Each bottle stopper was individually hand carved by the artist Scott Millar, so each one will be completely unique. Anyone ordering the bottle stopper from the mart will be sent an email to download all the album tracks on the release date, 29th March 2010. The idea is that if you don't want to finish a bottle of wine, you can use this stopper to reseal it. No, apparently, there are people who don't feel compelled to polish off a bottle once it's been opened. Here's a funny thing - Eddy Grant has accused Gorillaz of ripping off one of his tunes : Grant says Gorillaz copied his 1977 song Time Warp on their new single. "I am outraged that the Gorillaz have infringed the copyright of my song Time Warp, claiming their song Stylo to be an original composition," he said. Breach of copyright, eh? Now, there's something the RIAA are always quick to have something to say about. You only have to try and remember what a song sounds like, and the BPI will hit you with a lawsuit for copying the music to your cerebal cortex without the correct licence. Clearly, Grant's publisher, EMI, will be fuming over one of its artists having his copyright abused, right? [They] said it was "a private matter between Eddy Grant and Gorillaz". Oh. Um... well, what about Gorillaz's publishers? They, surely, won't sit back and be accused of stealing copyright - that's like stealing hangbags, remember? [They] said it was "a private matter between Eddy Grant and Gorillaz". Oh, yes. It turns out that, at least, the publishing arm of EMI aren't actually that upset at the thought of copyright being abused at all. Indeed, it's nothing more than a "private matter". Perhaps they might like to have come to this conclusion before the BPI tried to write UK legislation in the Digital Economy Bill.
This blog has been closed for quite some time. See http://martinaspeli.net for more up to date content. We've had a lot of discussions recently about quality management of plone.org/products - how do people who don't spend their days on plone-user and #plone work out what products are worth betting on, where they are going and whether they'll stay viable in the future? A lot of really great ideas came out of the session we held at the Plone Conference. We've taken the ones that seemed most workable and turned them into a todo-list for the PloneSoftwareCenter. To deliver these ideas, we need volunteers - Archetypes programmers, documentation writers, product reviewers and project manager types. If you want to help out, please check out the OpenPlans collaboration site - add your name and thoughts to the wiki, join the mailing list, discuss, commit code! See: http://www.openplans.org/projects/plone-products Since getting back into doing some Java/J2EE web development, I'm constantly struck by the sheer number of mega-frameworks that I feel I probably should know. It's overwhelming, it gives me a nervous twitch, like I could be investing lots of time in some framework that turns out to be inferior because I have no way of comprehending what else is out there. How do Java web app developers ever get anything done? Here's a list of frameworks and APIs that I've come across in my current project, all of which could have some relevance to my project: Java Servlet API JSP syntax JSTL JSF MyFaces/Tomahawk JSF components Oracle ADF JSF components Java Facelets Hibernate iBATIS EJB 2 EJB 3 JBoss SEAM Spring Struts WebWork SiteMesh Tapestry AppFuse Log4J JUnit JMock JDBC DBUnit Cactus Maven Cargo Ant Tomcat JBoss Eclipse MyEclipse Oh ... and I need to determine which ones of these can work together, and which of my tools will tolerate which technologies. Aaaaah! To be clear, my application is basically just forms that drive SQL queries. I don't even care so much about security. However, a goal was to try and use best-practice patterns and technologies, to ensure the application could scale up in the future. Now, I'm pretty good developer, I know Java (the language) well and I learn quickly. But several of the pieces above would take me a week or more (each) to learn properly. Obviously some are easier than others, and many are directly competing. But how do I know what to choose? How do I know where to invest my time? I looked for books, but it seems that many of them are out of date by the time they hit the printers. In the blogsphere, there are people who seem to be able to pick and choose between all of these. Power to them, but there is not a great consensus on what is best this week. If there is some canonical book that covers an end-to-end process with best practices - please, I'd like to know. :) But I started thinking about how this works in the Plone community. Im sure new users feel a bit overwhelemed, and that we could do things to make it easier for them. However, based on own experiences from when I first played with Plone, it wasn't nearly so bad: Plone is there, you can touch it and feel it and play with things to see how they break. Python is terse and readable. Although Java kicks our ass on API docs, it's easier to follow the actual code since the .py files are all there and legible. I learn best by example. Like most people, I started with a few copies of some page templates and later some Archetypes classes. That meant I could get results very quickly. Plone let me worry about my application and not think about security, user management, URL dispatch etc. Of course, I'm comparing apples to oranges here. Plone is a CMS and a platform for CMS-like systems. J2EE is much wider in scope. However, my application is not so unique - I need forms, page flow logic and database queries. Maybe one day some CRUD logic, and a few pages of text. Obviously, this is all in the terriotory of that infamous Better Web App video, and the cliche exodus of Java coders to Ruby-on-Rails. Fair enough, but I'd like to think that it's not impossible to be productive and feel in control of a Java-based solution. This is often a question of skills (people learn Java in school), of prior investment (people have been trained in Java already), of back-end systems (that already run in Java), and of trust (for business-critical components that may feasibly need a web front-end). I refuse to believe that just because Java is strongly typed and compiled, this can't be done right. So most likely I just haven't discovered that framework yet. However, there is another argument - Java is great for the middle tier, but less productive for the front end. Perhaps we should put more time into finding a bearable way of defining service layers that would let you build your user management and GUI in Plone or Django or Rails and let actual business processes take place in Java beans or EJBs. At least I think that separation would make a lot of decision makers more comfortable - Hibernate, EJB, Oracle (or Postgres) on the back-end, sexy GUI app on the front end that is infinitely more dispsable and lower risk, and is more likely to be what users want if it is written in a framework that encourages agile and rapid development. It may even help to ensure that the middle/back-end business objects are completely decoupled from the GUI and facilitate SOA. Pipe dreams. Anyone got a good Java book to recommend? I'm not quite sure why it's called Java Server Faces - perhaps beacuse it makes my server a two-faced liar - but they're here. Specifically, we're using JSF with Tomcat and Apache MyFaces and whatever versions of the JSF API that Maven decided to pull down today (I think we're on 1.1). Now, I don't have the time to read a few books on the subject, so I'm feeling a bit ignorant and inadequate. That feeling, however, is amplified many-fold by the fact that I am unable to step through most of the code that's not behaving the way I expected. Perhaps I could get there by downloading big tarballs and configuring source attachments in Eclipse, but I worry this may be a big black hole and I'm reluctant. The balance of JAR files being managed in my IDE and deployed in various cases is already quite precarious, so I don't want to upset it. The second thing I miss desperately is pdb's (the python debugger) interactive prompt. Some things are definitely not working the way I expect. I can get some way with the Eclipse debugger and watch expressions, but it's cumbersome and slow. Thirdly, my productivity is hampered by the constant re-compiles. Every time I change something, even a template, I'm recompiling and re-deploying to my local Tomcat instance. It's possible that I could find a way to edit templates in-place in the exploded .war file in Tomcat, or hot-replace them at least, but the only way I knew to do that was with MyEclipse and it doesn't like my Java Facelets templates. This is not made better by the fact that we have three dependent projects. I have to a dance in Eclipse and Maven that involves 'mvn clean install' on a dependent project, cleaning code in Eclipse, and then re-deploying the project. I just lost nearly an hour pulling my hair out writing banal tests when it turned out that Tomcat wasn't executing the code that was being shown in my debugger. Meanwhile, this blog post has formed whilst I'm waiting for things to re-compile. Each time, my distraction period grows a bit longer, and my productivity dips a bit further. Lastly (for now) there is way, way too much magic going on with JSF components. As far as I can tell, every form button is actually managed by a generated snippet of inline JavaScript. This (or something else) is managing some state that persists across Tomcat restarts, which sometimes is persisting the component tree (i.e. the tree of JSF components, which is formed by XML tags in various nanespaces, interleaved in non-obvious ways with the DOM of page itself). Sometimes, I get bizarre errors because some remnant of the page from half an hour ago is still being processed. Sometimes, not reliably reproduceable. The only way I've found to reliably test my code is to close down my browser completely and then re-open it after each re-compile/server re-start. Joy. Further, sometimes the state appears to be saved but it's not - when I click a certain button which has a client-side handler (which is hooked up to a method on a bean by way of some magic expressions) but which aims to stay at the current page after processing, the UI shows form controls with values still entered, but they are magically lost when I click another form button causing an empty form to be submitted. Oh - and sometimes the first command link (think an &lt;a&gt; tag, except it's actually handled with some inline JavaScript on an onclick event and bound into the JSF dispatch machinery) that I click immediately after the application is started leads to a blank page being rendered (something about a phase of the component tree rendering not being ready, I read somewhere), and I have to re-load it to see anything. I'm sure I'm just ignorant and that there are better ways of going about all of this, but I've spent as much time as I can afford with books and Google, and now I just need to get some work done. I'm patching together working practices that feel inferior and clumsy, but basically work. Luckily, this application is small, so there's not that much to do. But it doesn't feel particularly elegant. (/me wants a view and a few adapters) Please refrain from pointing and laughing, but if you have some useful tips, I'm all ears. I really should know better than to post this. Really. Please, don't start a big flame war. But, I peer over the fence from time to time skim through some tutorials and demos on Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails in particular, and one of the things that puts me off it (aside from the sunk cost of my Python knowledge and the fact that my favourite open source CMS project uses Python), is that ... it's so ... ugly. I have an in-built aversion to blocks that end with an end keyword. Call it prejudice. I once learnt Visual Basic. Maybe that's it, but there are also lots of strange symbols flying about. $`? If someone has seen the beauty in Ruby, please enlighten me. I genuinely believe that code asthetics are important in motivating programmers, ensuring consistency, catching mistakes and ultimately producing better software. Of course this is totally subjective. But some good examplse of elegance and aesthetics would be nice. One of the interesting fallouts from the recent discussions about Nuxeo moving CPS over to Java in the future, is whether relying on tools like IDEs is legitimate, and indeed whether this is just excuse-making for the deficiencies of a language. I'd argue that it doesn't matter. Whether you call it a language or a tool is largely moot. We don't edit Python in ed, we use vim or Emacs or TextMate (sensible people use the latter). Some languages are complemented well by tools, others have less need for them, and some just don't have very good tools available. The important metric is how efficient you are within your working environment, taken as a whole to include your language, your framework and your full toolchain. Therefore, the learning curve = the language + the tool . If getting the tools set up is going to take you a long time, you lose productivity. Eclipse is fairly easy going. Some of the plug-ins are a pain to get and install, others are a breeze. But move down one level, and it can become a pain to manage builds with Maven (which is very powerful but can also be very complex when you step outside the box a little) or Ant (which is not that complicated, but requires a fair bit of manual work). I know companies that invest two weeks of a team's time just to get the build environment set up and configured right, which surely is wrong. And secondly - when the tool does the wrong thing, you probably still need to understand what's going on. That complexity that the tool was hiding is rarely hidden completely, forever, because at some point your tool doesn't yet support the thing you need to do. And in many cases, the tool then expects to manage your source code in its own way and either stomps on your changes or breaks utterly. Good tool design, it seems, is not much easier than good language design. There are still some things I miss in my current, very minimal Python set-up (consisting of Python, Terminal.app, TextMate, Firefox, FireBug), such as code-completion and support for refactoring by finding and modifying code that needs changing because I renamed a function or moved it up or down the inheritance hierachy. But in most cases, Python is high-level enough that the tools I need are in the language itself, saving me from having to learn a whole new tool. And in the meantime, I just love doing this: $ cd Products $ mate CMFPlone CMFCore CMFDefault ATContentTypes This opens TextMate with all those directories in a project, and I can grep (Cmd+Shift+F), edit, read, svn (Ctrl+Shift+A), add and remove files and do everything else I need. The alternative is to start Eclipse, find the right workspace, and add the particular folder to a project (or open an existing one). Thanks, but by the time Eclipse has loaded, I'm already onto my next task. :) I'm going to argue out of ignorance. I am not nearly as close to the Nuxeo guys as I am to many other Zope people, and I don't have very much direct experience with CPS at all. However, I want to speculate a bit about the recent announcement that Nuxeo 5 (which is basically the evolution from CPS 4) will be 100% J2EE, in light of some realities that are abundantly clear at my existing employer. CPS always felt a bit reclusive in the Zope world. Florent, Leonnart, Jean-Marc and Tariq (I probably spelled half of those wrong) were visible in the Zope 2, CMF and Five spheres, and I really like them and their work. However, CPS itself was (is) one of things that we often thought, "oh, it's really powerful and good" but never really used. Maybe it's because I don't speak French. Maybe it's because I'm addicted to the Plone community. But CPS was (is) Nuxeo's baby and business model. Which is perfectly, perfectly fine (and it's still fully open source, as will Nuxeo 5 be). Florent and Leonnart in particular contributed tons to CMF, Five and other parts of the stack. But it's these contributions we'll miss (presuming they stop, which I hope they don't), not the CPS-specific Zope technology that we never much re-used (or got around to looking at, perhaps). I've been doing some J2EE work lately. There are things that are quite good about it, and there are things that are not. The Nuxeo 5 FAQ says that Java can be pleasurable with the right tool support. Maybe, but I can count on all my hands and toes the number of hours I've lost to trying to get the build system to play ball, configuring various tools and plug-ins, and debugging strange errors in non-readable code. I'm sure it'd be much better if I worked with Java day in, day out, got tons of training and had it all laid out for me by a standard build that some soul had spent months setting up and testing. At my employer, that'll never be the reality. I have some particular beef with JSF (Java Server Faces). It may be the best Java's got for web UI, but it's still painfully slow and often unpredictable (I see some component tree state caches that don't invalidate properly, for example). It does not play well with JSP at all. Java Facelets help, and even have METAL-style macros, but don't even think of showing a complex JSF-based UI to a web designer. It's hard to know where the line between HTML and JSF components go, and JSF components still involve writing HTML to an output stream with Java code (they say they're working on it). I'm sure I just don't understand it, but I have seen supposedly cutting-edge JSF work (in Alfresco), and it's still awkard (single templates having a myriad of responsibilities). The reason that I don't understand it because the stack is a mile high. JSF builds on JSP builds on servlets builds on streams builds on ... EJBs are just scary. Hibernate is quite good, actually, but I found it hard to debug. I'm quite quick at picking up new technologies, but the
amount of technologies I have to understand to be productive is so large. I really wanted to use Spring, but that was another book to read. Again, if I did it day in day out and could affort to take a month on a training course or two, I'd probably do fine, but it's not the reality. Will Nuxeo's programmers be happier with Java? Perhaps so, it may fit their brains well. They may find that it pays back in terms of stability, predictability and scalability (I'm somewhat sceptical of those arguments). They will certainly find it easier to hire new, talented developers. But I can't help suspect that this has a lot to do with commercial realities. Alfresco has created a lot of noise off a product that's very, very impressive on paper and reasonably impressive on screen. It doesn't have anywhere near Plone's customisation/application-building story, for example. But if you read the spec list, it includes things like JSR170 and JSR168. Java standards (supposedly) for content storage and portlets, respectively. It talks to Lucene and Hibernate and MyFaces and MySQL, it uses Spring. These are things that are often singled out as "best-of-breed" open source components. A digression... the Open Source in Java Enterprise world is bit of a parallel universe to the one we know in Zope and Plone. Different kinds of people hang out there. Investment comes from heavy-weights and Sun specification working groups. Apache/Jakarta are kings (and they have a lot of very, very impressive software)... end digession... But Gartner goes out and says, "demand JSR170 to avoid lock-in". The ZODB makes IT managers quiver (call it an object store, not a database, Matt Hammilton says). Butler says, "demand JSR168 to integrate your applications with your portal server". IBM tell you, maybe it'll even work. We have viewlets and component architectures that make those things seem like last year's fashion, but that isn't what people buying IT look for. And probably for good reason. They shouldn't invest their money in unproven solutions, hard-to-integrate platforms or dying products. It's often a lot of money on the table, and being conservative is often a good thing (whether they always get what the bought is another story). So, for Nuxeo, I'm sure that their clients will be very much more impressed if the 10 minute PowerPoint sales pitch includes a number of technologies they have heard about. It makes a lot of sense, especially since their stated target is the ECM sphere, and I'm guessing their customers have a lot of similar Java technologies already deployed. And I am really glad that there will be a credible alternative to Alfresco in the Java-based ECM/DMS market. As far as Plone is concerned, I think our edge will always be in flexibility and agility. I can do things with Plone much faster than I can with any other platform, and I can develop cleaner, better-tested components using Zope 3 technologies than any other platform I've ever seen. At the same time, people like Enfold are doing incredible things with integration, and Plone 3.0 should put us back on the innovation curve with exciting new tools and technologies. Mostly, I'm not worried because the Plone community is so vibrant, with so many cool people and such a lot of friendship. In open source, this is worth more than technology. But at the same time, I'm very eager to find out what Nuxeo's very talented developers will manage to come up with. Hopefully, I'll have a chance to sit down with them over a drink and get their experiences straight from the horse's mouth. Nuxeo.com/org have a commercial story to tell. I wish them the best of luck. Sometimes doing debugging through-the-web is unavoidable. Templates are a prime example - I just spent the better part of two hours trying to work out why my use of metal:macro was not playing ball with a Five browser view (hint: understand what macro you're actually calling...). Sometimes I also simply don't know enoug about how something works to write a reliable and more easily debuggable test, and some trial-and-error is needed. A few things can make it more bearable, though: Customise default_error_message . That is, go to portal_skins/plone_templates in the ZMI and customise this template. Remove the call to metal:use-macro="here/main_template/macros/main" . Why? Because rendering Plone's full 404 template takes a few seconds on my machine. For some reason, this template has always been dog slow. For debugging, all you care about is the error message. By not referencing main_template , you get a plain-text error message, which renders instantly. While you're at it, change &lt;dd translate="" content="structure err_value"&gt; to &gt;dd translate="" content="err_value"&gt; , removing the structure keyword. This gives you a plain-text error message, which will not hide thing slike in when the browser things its HTML. Add an external method with a pdb break point. e.g. I have Extensions/debug.py , which contains only: def debug(self): import pdb; pdb.set_trace() Then, either in the portal_skins/custom folder or just the root of the Plone site, add an External Method in the ZMI, with name debug-ex , module debug , method debug . With this in place, you can go to http://localhost:8080/Plone/foo/debug-ex . Make sure you run Zope in the foreground ( zopectl fg ). Your browser will hang, but on the console that you launched Zope, you will get a pdb session, where self refers to the current context (i.e. foo in the URL above). Here, you can do whatever you want, such as inspect the object or mutate it. Remember, you can import other code, call protected methods - do pretty much anything you can do on the interpreter shell. Type pp to pretty-print a variable or an expression. Type c and press Enter to get your browser back. If you're using a Five browser view with a template (either via the template argument to the ZCML directive or via an explicitly invoked ViewPageTemplateFile / ZopeTwoPageTemplateFile , remember that this does not have security assertions the way .pt files in portal_skins does. That is, you can do things like: tal:content="python:foo._secretVariable.__of__(context).aq_chain" So long as you're in debug mode, the you can reload the page and see the output of that statement. This is quite useful for trying things out and quick-inspecting variables. Be ruthless with pdb. Sometimes you are wondering how something works deep inside Zope. So long as you revert your changes afterwards, you can put a pdb statement almost anywhere. For example, whilst debugging a security problem, enable verbose-security in zope.conf and try to put a pdb statement in AccessControl.ImplPython.validate() . You'll have to restart Zope obviously for this to take effect... Interleave your work. Sometimes, you need to restart Zope. This is slow. :) Learn to do two things at once, e.g. work on improving tests for other parts of the code, writing new interfaces or updating documentation while Zope is restarting, or go help someone with their problems on #plone on IRC :)
Ada apa dengan pelayar web Opera 10.50? Hmm.. Opera kini muncul dengan versi stabil dan memperkenalkan beberapa fungsi yang baru. Antara fungsi yang baru pada pelayar web ini adalah sokongan HTML5 dan CSS3. Opera 10.50 dikatakan sebagai pelayar web terpantas di dunia pada masa kini kerana menggunakan enjin Javascript yang baru iaitu Carakan . Buat masa ini pelayar web Opera 10.50 hanya sedia untuk dimuat-turun oleh para pengguna Windows sahaja. Bagi pengguna Mac dan Linux terpaksalah tunggu dulu. Download pelayar web Opera 10.50 sekarang dan cuba korang bandingkan dengan Chrome dan Mozilla.. p/s: setakat nih aku Chrome masih jadi web browser yang paling aku suka~ Mozilla Firefox pulak slalu crash kat pc aku..:( Aku baru perasan yang google chrome nih ade task manager. Very cool! Kalo nak tengok task manager google chrome gunakan kombinasi Shift + Esc untuk windows..kalo OS lain aku xpasti~ stat for nerd? hehe.. Microsoft baru sahaja melancarkan Windows Phone 7 Series hari nih. In this video, NVIDIA speaks to scientists at Temple University who are using GPUs to model "surfactants". Surfactants are biological agents that attach themselves to dirt, make it mix with water and determine the cleaning capacity and texture of shampoos, laundry detergents, and many other cleaning products. Cheapest super computer in the world!! Dibina oleh seorang professor di Jepun menggunakan komponen komputer biasa yang senang didapati dari kedai komputer. Orang malaysia bila lagi nak wat menda camnih? hehe.. Aku baru jer test Google Chrome OS dalam virtual box ku..puas hati, sebab selama nih aku asyik dengar je pasal OS nih tapi xpernah ada kesempatan mencubanya.Ini merupakan screenshoot yang ku ambil semalam...klik pada image untuk gambar yg lebih besar. Anda baru sahaja install Ubuntu di dalam PC anda. Tetapi kemudian anda menyedari, di mana kah root password anda? Bagaimana hendak log in sebagai root? Misteri yang menyelebungi kebanyakan pengguna baru-adakah anda tidak set password root semasa mula2 proses installation? The root user - atau lebih dikenali sebagai superuser adalah pengguna Ubuntu dan Unix yang mempunyai kuasa administrator penuh (full access) terhadap sistem operasi. Pengguna biasa tidak di galakkan menggunakan root semasa melakukan arahan biasa kerana sebarang kesilapan command boleh merosakkan sistem. Ubuntu dan root password. Secara default, akaun root telah dikunci di dalam Ubuntu. Anda tidak boleh login sebagai root atau menggunakan command su - untuk menjadi superuser. Jadi untuk melaksanakan sebarang arahan anda mestilah menggunakan arahan sudo. Tips: Jika malas untuk menaip sudo pada setiap kali untuk melaksanakan command, gunakan command di bawah. $ sudo -i Arahan di atas akan mengaktifkan /bin/bash sebagai root shell. Jadi anda boleh menggunakan arahan tanpa memerlukan arahan sudo. How do I login as root user? Buka terminal dan taipkan arahan seperti dibawah $ sudo bash ataupun $ sudo -s masukkan password anda dan anda boleh menjadi root user!
Lately I've been talking to random strangers on the street. Just to get their story, sorta briefly find out who they are. I like to take interest in people's lives. Even strangers. I'm sorry to say, that I didn't talk to this man. At least I took his picture though. &nbsp; In any case, I think it's important to show people that you care about them by simply asking how they are or just listening to what they have to say when they speak. I mean, I don't expect anyone of you to walk up to strangers, lol. I'm just weird like that. But I mean, at least talk to your friends/family. Check up on them. They'll feel good, you'll feel good. And when that happens....well, life is just good. And that can't be bad, because it's good, right? Well anyway. It's Sunday. Have a good week everyone. BUT WAIT, ONE MORE THING. If you like my blog, then I'm sure that you'll like.... Claire au Vietnam xynthian through the looking glass. I thought it looked cool. It didn't come out exactly the way I wanted though. But I still like it. Do you? Although Newark had their protest against education budget cuts yesterday, the rest of California school districts had theirs today. Here are some pictures from Fremont Unified School District's protest that took place on Mowry ave/Fremont blvd. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; California schools are protesting the statewide budget cuts that are being made to education as of late. The protests are being organized by the California Teacher's Association (CTA) . This afternoon Newark Memorial high school of Newark, California had their protest. Students and staff walked down Cedar blvd, getting the praise of many in the forms of honks and enthusiastic shouts. At the time of this post, the protest is still going on. But I rushed home so I could post the pictures that I took. You all know me. ;] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nikon F601m/N6000 Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400 Vivtar 35-105mm f/3.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really should invest in a better scanner.

I remember when I had to dissect them in..... 7th grade. I felt bad. It's too bad the autofocus on my digital point and shoot won't allow better focusing than this.&nbsp;
Wow, it's been awhile since I've blogged. I had previously posted a couple of messages on here about some of the personal upheaval that's kept me away from the puppetry intrawebs for so long. I'm somewhat reluctant to discuss my personal life and circumstances in a public forum like this - if anything recent events have taught me to never, ever do that again - but suffice to say I had a number of deaths and serious illnesses among my family and friends including the passing of my father and the combination of natural grief and dealing with all the mundane things you have to deal with when people die or are ill kept me away and distracted. I owe an especially big apology to everyone who enrolled in the Puppet Building 101 course (see previous post ) I was running at the beginning of the summer. Circumstances forced me to postpone the course after it started by a few weeks, then until the Fall and finally to cancel it outright because changes in my personal and professional responsibilities just don't allow me the time to do it. Refunds to everyone who enrolled were held up because of some PayPal-related snafus, but I'm relieved to say that the last of them were issued this week. Now it's come to my attention recently that there was some particularly nasty chat about this on at least one other puppetry website. I haven't really been online much for several months and the relevant threads seem to have now been deleted by moderators, but this flame war seemed to escalate last week to the point where certain individuals (well, ok, mainly one individual) who had been enrolled in the course wase harassing and beginning to cyberstalk other members of the online puppetry community. I certainly can understand people being upset and frustrated about Puppet Building 101, but I'm baffled as to why someone seems to be taking that out on folks who have nothing to do with the situation. I am not going to name names, but this person knows who they are and would like to appeal to them to come to their senses and stop this. You are only going to end up hurting yourself and not the person you're mad at (me). I do want to take this opportunity to publicly and sincerely apologise to anyone who was enrolled for the cancellation as well as any inconvenience and frustration the long, drawn-out situation caused. Although the circumstances were largely out of my control, I wish I had been able to deal with the situation in a more prompt manner. I've spent a long time building up a lot of goodwill with this little ol' blog here and it's unfortunate that it has become tainted by the fallout from my Summer from Hell. So to the two dozen or so people who were affected, please accept my unconditional apology. I hope I can find a way to make it up to you in the future. Sorry for the lack of recent updates. I've recently been occupied by a family emergency and updates may be few and far between over the summer as a result. If you're enrolled in the Puppet Building 101 course, it's been placed on hold until July 13th, at which point it will resume. I have no definite future plans right now, but things will probably return to normal sometime around late August or early September. Thanks for your understanding. Kathy Danley made a short video featuring an adorable Sock Zombie. Remember Erin Glaser's Sock Zombies ? Well, Kathy Danley went and made a short film with one of them! You can watch Sock Zombie "doing the dating thing" on YouTube . Jay ThePal (and Kay ThePal) seem to be popping up all over social media lately. It took me a little while to figure out what was up with Jay ThePal , a puppet character that seemed to start popping up all over every social media website that you can think of lately. I think I first saw him (along with Kay ThePal) when they gave me a shout-out on 12seconds.tv , which is sort of Twitter for video. Jay ThePal is one of those FAO Schwartz "Whatnot" Muppet puppets and seems to be a sort of puppetry experiment that's happening all over the web ( Twitter , YouTube , 12seconds , etc.). It's a little difficult to get a handle on the whole project or where it's going, but it's very interesting to watch how people are using puppetry to explore social media. Definitely something to keep an eye on. Puppetry students at the University of Hawaii re-create The Evolution of Dance with a puppet. I love Bunraku-style puppetry, so I really enjoyed seeing A Study of Movement (The Evolution of Dance) , a final project for a puppetry class at the University of Hawaii inspired by the famous YouTube viral video . Paul recently did a great post on his blog about Jim Henson's early commercial spots and how that could be a successful advertising model today. I think he's absolutely right; his post reminds me of one I wrote a couple years ago called Using Puppets To Pay The Bills . The 30 second pre-roll ad is almost universally hated. The web is a new medium that we're still in early stages of exploring. The people who really "break through" and define it will be the ones who figure out new ways of telling stories and develop new (old?) ways of thinking about advertising and sponsorship. Dan Stevers creates Christian-themed motion graphics. Over the past month or I've been watching and enjoying Dan Stevers ' Christian-themed motion graphics videos on Vimeo. Two of my favourites are The Light of the World and Life With God . Some of Dan's videos are artistic interpretations of Christian scripture , while others simply illustrate basic Christian principles . You can see all of Dan's videos on Vimeo . His work is available to purchase from Worship House Media . "OK" nicely combines puppetry and pop-up books. I know at least a couple puppeteers who love to make pop-up books. This music video from an unfortunately named band seems to combine those two interests very nicely. Via Mary Robinette Kowal .
Thomas Ford packed over 70 music lovers into our meeting room last Friday night, as the four-piece band Trillium performed for our Friday at the Ford concert series. As usual, the concert was presented by the Western Springs Library Friends , who also provided refreshments. It got a little warm in the room but it was a happy warm with many tapping feet. Because it was almost St. Patrick's Day, the band featured a number of tunes of Irish origin, but they also played bluegrass, American folk, and jazz. Every piece sent us in an enjoyable new direction. The audience seemed to appreciate the virtuosity. The band seemed to really like the attentive audience. The applause was hearty and there was a fairly brisk sale of CDs after the concert. Mim Eichmann (hammered dulcimer and vocals) said that the band enjoys playing at libraries and would like to get more jobs in the Chicago area. Biographies, sample music, and contact info can be found at their website . Throughout my career as a librarian, one activity that I have enjoyed is looking at picture in the middle of biographies and memoirs. They evoke in me a feeling similar to finding old pictures in a drawer in my mother's house. I can become transfixed. This can easily happen at the library when I find new books sitting on a cart right out of technical processing, when I am working on reference questions, or when I am weeding collections. I find myself gazing at the photos of the subjects in their youth, then doing whatever made them famous, and finally in old age. There is often more to see than just famous people - there are old clothes, old cars, and interesting locations. I am hooked by these glossy pages. At a recent book discussion, one of the club members said that her favorite thing about biographies were the pictures in the middle. I understood, but I was suddenly conscious of all the biographies that I have examined in the past three years that did not have picture-in-the-middle sections. I wondered why I had not thought about the change - if there really has been a change. So I decided to do a little investigating. I have been looking at many biographies published in 2009 anyway, so I created a spreadsheet to keep track of how these books deal with pictures. I used only third person biographies for the study, no memoirs. I discovered two common ways to use pictures in biographies: 1) group pictures into inserted sections, often on glossy paper, or 2) distribute the pictures throughout the text with no glossy paper. There are two other less common ways to use pictures: 3) insert a single picture on glossy paper with a blank back in a few strategic spots in a book (common a hundred years ago), or 4) fill the books with photos and minimal text. The fourth method really makes a different type of book, a photobiography. Looking at 66 biographies from 2009, I found: 40 books (61 %) with inserted picture sections 20 books (30 %) with pictures spread throughout the text 2 books (3 %) with single inserted pages 2 books were photobiographies (3 %) 4 books had no illustrations (6 %) This adds to more than 100 % because Tom and Jack: The Intertwined Lives of Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock by Henry Adams had both a color insert section and black-and-white photos distributed through the text, while Rehnquist by Herman J. Obermayer had both distributed photos as well a few single page/single photo inserts on glossy paper. Seeing that more than half of the biographies still had picture sections in the middle, I wondered if I had really been right in thinking there were more in the past. I decided to go back twenty years and look at biographies from 1989. At the Downers Grove Public Library in Illinois, I was able to find 46 biographies published in 1989: 36 book (79 %) had picture sections 6 books (13 %) had pictures spread through the text 1 book (2 %) had no photos 4 books were photobiographies (8 %) Again, the total is greater than 100 % because Mozart: The Golden Years by H.C. Robbins Landon had both color illustrations in an inserted section as well as black and white illustrations throughout the text. My sample size may not be large enough to be definitive, but it appears to me that there has been a shift in the way biographies include photos. The method that has gained popularity is incorporating pictures into the text, but separate picture sections are still found in more than half of today's biographies. It will be interesting to see if the trend continues with more emphasis on reducing printing costs. Glossy sections must cost more, and digital publishing makes it easier to insert photos into the text.

Abelard to Heloise In medieval Paris for about two years around 1115 to 1116, the philosopher Peter Abelard and his student Heloise became impassioned lovers. Abelard even sweet-talked his way into residency in Heloise's uncle's compound to more easily continue the secret affair. (Uncle Fulbert was her guardian.) Even in such close proximity, the couple wrote each other daily letters (in Latin which the letter carrier could not read) praising their love. Amazingly, some of these letters which were lost for nearly 900 years were identified in the 1990s. Using these and the better known letters the couple wrote long after their affair, James Burge has written Heloise &amp; Abelard: A New Biography . Readers get a sense of both these remarkable people in this intimate dual biography. Abelard was a brilliant academic who believed fervently in logic. He was able to win almost any debate. What he lacked was any tact and an ability to curb his own arrogance. He needlessly made many jealous enemies, lost many teaching positions, and was often charged as a hertic. When Heloise's uncle discovered the betrayal of his hospitality and that Heloise was pregnant, the old man was livid. Abelard married Heloise, took her to Brittany out of the uncle's reach, and returned to teach in Paris. When his guard was down, Abelard was attacked in his bed and castrated by the uncle's men. Heloise was one of Abelard's best student, grasping complex philosophical ideas and a master of languages. Her origins are not certain. She may have been the illegitimate daughter of a nun. After Abelard's castratation and his becoming a monk, she became a nun, eventually becoming the much honored abbess of an order. In this book, I think Heloise outshines Abelard. He was really too devoted to himself and always needed someone to defend him. She fended for herself quite well. I most like that she refused to ever bow to Abelard's request that she feel remorseful for their joint "sin." She enjoyed the "sin" and would always love Abelard. Readers of Heloise &amp; Abelard: A New Biography also learn quite a bit about twelfth century church controversies and French history. Eleanore of Aquitaine even show up at the end of the story. I recommend the book to history and biography readers. Burge, James. Heloise &amp; Abelard: A New Biography . HarperSanFrancisco, 2003. ISBN 0060736631. We are breaking with our past at Thomas Ford. One thing that you could always count on was that the reference books were here on the shelves. As good as that was in the past, the problem now is that the reference books are here on the shelves, but no one is here using them. They are just sitting. So we are liberating them. We're going to let them out to anyone with a card, just like other books, magazines, CDs, and DVDs. The one precedent here is the liberating of the magazines a couple of decades ago. We used to keep the magazines close for all the students doing reports and term papers. We now have online databases with full texts, and those days are long gone. Finally, it is time to free the reference books as well. Our Adult Services librarians have spent several weeks preparing to let reference books circulate. With Sandy Frank's assistance (she's the head of the circulation department), we have inventoried the collection, weeded out-of-date and worn-out materials, and changed the circulation system status for each record. The work is done and we are starting a quiet launch while we prepare marketing. Here are reasons for this new service: Use of reference books in the library has fallen off significantly in the past several years. Librarians with access to online resources are using the print reference items less frequently. Fewer clients are spotted using reference books. We reshelve reference books less often. The reference shelves rarely need straightening. Clients occasionally ask to borrow the reference books so they can use them at home or work. Much of the information in the reference books is available to us though our databases. Reference librarians will still have resources to answer questions. With less money to buy nonfiction books this year, it provides more items to loan students and other clients interested in nonfiction topics. Other libraries have begun to loan their reference books. Meetings at the 2009 ALA Conference in Chicago and posts on the Booklist blog Points of Referenc e have discussed the new trend. The primary objection I have heard is "What if a book from a set doesn't return, isn't the set ruined?" This is a possibility, maybe even a probability in time. Still having books sit idle seems a greater sorrow in a public library focused on current utility and not archival conservation. I think the greater good will be served by this service. I look froward to seeing some smiles when I let someone take a volume of Contemporary Literary Criticism or The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians . We do not expect a rush of people coming for the reference books right away, but we hope for steady use. Maybe this liberation will even revive the section and make reference books worth buying again. Ann Nixon Cooper died at age 107 in Atlanta in December 2009, just before her book A Century and Some Change: My Life Before the President Called My Name was published. The positive view of her death is that she finished the book in time before she departed, and that she had had enough of the fame that being mentioned for voting for presidential candidate Barack Obama had brought her. She had already lived a full life. She did not die too soon. Hers was a life to celebrate for its goodness. In some ways, Cooper's life was fairly ordinary and not really bookworthy unless we are all bookworthy as representatives of our time. What singled her out was vitality at an advanced age and living an affluent life (though never conspicuous) in the black community of Atlanta through the days of Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement. She served as a witness to the great talents and work ethic of blacks when white culture was denying that blacks were equal. Filled with photos as well as Cooper's memories, contemporary readers see and hear in A Century and Some Change how the families of black professionals could have nice houses, send their children to good schools, know powerful people, and yet still be expected to step to the side of a sidewalk to let whites pass or sit in the back of the bus. A Century and Some Change celebrates the good more than regrets the bad. It is a thoughtful book that may be quickly read. I recommend it for older readers wanting to remember the past and younger readers needing to know about segregation and forgiveness. Cooper, Ann Nixon.

 Christie's daughter Rosland Hicks gave Greenway, her mother's Devon country home, to Great Britain's National Trust in 2000. Within a few quick years, the grounds and gardens with their beautiful views of the River Dart were open to the public, and in 2009, after a few longer years of restoration and decorating with original furniture, the house itself was opened for Christie fans to see. According to author Hilary Macaskill in her book Agatha Christie at Home , Greenway is now a prime stop in the increasingly popular tour of Agatha Christie sites in England. In her new book, Macaskill takes readers on a broader tour to places Christie lived, including London, seaports, and villages across England, telling a little bit about the mystery writer's life and pointing out locations used in Christie's popular stories. An attractive mixture of archived and current photographs supplements the brief text. Some show Christie picnicking, repainting a mantelpiece, and entertaining guests in her various homes. Others show lush landscapes and well-tended gardens. Readers see throughout that Christie liked good comfortable accommodations, beyond the means of people without bestselling book income, without ever being ostentatious. Overall, Agatha Christie at Home is a light treatment of the writer's life, not enough to satisfy a student needing in-depth information, but enough to persuade fans to add locations to their English travel plans. With Christie's books continuing to be read and new productions appearing on public television, it should interest readers in many libraries. Macaskill, Hilary. Agatha Christie at Home .

After watching a film, members of our film discussion group at my library usually first say what they like about a movie, whether that be the acting, music, or cinematography. We then move on to issues that the film develops. After seeing For My Father , an Israeli/German film about a reluctant suicide bomber, however, we needed a period to just try to figure out what we just saw. Many of us had questions. Why was Tarek on this suicide mission when he seemed to disapprove of the idea? What hold did the terrorists have over his family? Why did the fix-it man give him a new electrical switch if he suspected Tarek's mission? How did Tarek get into Tel Aviv so easily if their was such a high security alert? What attraction was there between Tarek and the shopkeeper Keren? Why didn't the vest with the explosives seem bulkier under Tarek's jacket? Why did none of Keren's friends show up for the party on the beach? If there was such a high security alert were there no police on the beach? The discussion did eventually turn to issues. We were generally sympathetic to the plight of both Israeli and Palestinian common people caught in the middle of senseless violence. We thought that was the general intent of For My Father . However, I wonder whether having an atypical bomber was as enlightening as having a typical bomber who believed in his/her cause would have been. Then we might really have had something to discuss. Instead, the director took a rather Hollywood approach - lots of good guys and bad guys, insert a romance between two attractive young people, and create a deadline for the action. For My Father was nominated for seven awards from the Israeli Academy, but it did not win any of them. It also won several film festival awards. With the hype, I expected more. For My Father .

Anyone who looked closely enough at that time would have seen the great inequities and built up anger among the poor, but most of the world never looked past the facade of the wealthy upper class. At the top of the social structure were descendants of free blacks from America, who moved to the western coast of Africa in the nineteenth century. Helene Cooper's family belonged to that class. She tells about her family and the revolution that changed their lives in her memoir The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood . Fascinated by the details, I listened to Cooper read her own book. To my surprise, her younger years seemed very American, as she and her classmates lived in suburbs filled with new ranch and split-level houses. Many had video recorders with which to watch American television programs sent to them by relatives in the United States. They even ate American snack foods. Somewhat to Cooper's dismay, her family bought an isolated mansion on a beach far from all her friends. Every child got her own bedroom, but there were no friends to visit them. (Here's where the story strays from those of American children.) So her family adopted a poor girl to be Helene's similar-age sister. It was a very upper class Liberian thing to do. The girl was named Eunice, and she became a member of the family - except she did not get to go on vacations to Spain or attend the best school with Helene. Cooper's privileged life ended when Samuel Kanyon Doe led a bloody coup, killing President Tolbert. Rebel soldiers spread across the country killing, raping, and stealing. (I'm not going to spoil the plot, but Cooper has a very dramatic story to insert right here.) After a nail-biting month, she and her family (without Eunice) escaped to America, starting Cooper's long-distance-but-never-out-of-mind relationship to her self-destructing country. She eventually graduated from college and became a foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal . The story of Liberia is very sad and can be very disturbing reading. Cooper does not avoid telling about despicable acts, but she also does not dwell on them. While telling some of the country's history, she is mostly interested in the fate of individuals. Readers will notice that Cooper has a slow political awakening, but she never really breaks with the class of her birth. Her unstated feelings are probably still conflicted, aware that her ancestors exploited the poorer classes, but she is still unforgiving toward the violent, unruly people who tore her country apart. The House at Sugar Beach is good reading. Cooper, Helene. The House at Sugar Beach: In Search of a Lost African Childhood . Recorded Books, 2008. ISBN 9781436164412
Subtitle: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks I am fascinated by networks. Certainly the social networking websites currently available are revealing in a less abstract manner how far our connections are really spread. The most rewarding aspect of joining these sites was the initial 30 minutes after having signed-up when you were quickly reconnected with ex-colleagues and long-forgotten high school acquaintances. From there it is mostly downhill and I am still amazed by those who find so many non-commercial ways to occupy their time posting, tweeting and chatting away. I spend little time on these sites and am becoming more and more skeptical that they will be able to retain their entertainment value (and massive subscriber growth) before being besieged by individuals and companies trying to push their products and services on you. A recent interview from a Pepsi marketing manager I unfortunately saw on CNN should give a clear indication of what is to come. Pepsi's desire to have a "conversation" with its customers does not bode well to those who find a large aspect of Facebook's appeal to be the limited advertisements pasted on its pages. However, I do confess to having a soft spot for LinkedIn. It has focused on the business community from day and is now evolving into a profitable company with a clear business model. By being a site catering to business users, it is somehow more justified to find ways to drive revenue - a luxury not necessarily granted to Facebook. LinkedIn is so great because it allows the users to really see the reach of their networks. By using the "people" search function on the site, I discover to have contacts in Madagascar, Saudi Arabia and Suriname and all of them are only one contact removed from me - meaning that they are connected to someone in my own 170-person network. 20 years ago these same networks existed but it was just much harder to visibly construct them. The premise of Nexus is that there is scientific evidence demonstrating how the network that links the six billion of us is not completely random in nature but actually has a certain structural configuration. The author then demonstrates how such network structures are not just relevant for human acquaintanceship. Buchanan introduces the argument by referring to a fascinating experiment conducted by the psychologist, Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. I was familiar with Milgram for the famous test that bears his name yet was unaware he was also credited what came to be know the "six-degrees of separation". In the Six-Degrees test, Milgram mailed at random letters to people living in Omaha, Nebraska and asked them to forward the letter to a stockbroker friend of his in Boston. He provided no address for the stockbroker but instead asked them to send it to someone who they believed to be "socially closer" to him than they were. Most of the letters made it to his friend as each subsequent recipient forwarded the letter to the next person applying the same request. The most surprising aspect was that it did not take hundreds of mailings but six. It was then the work of two other academics, Watts and Strogatz, who when further studying Milgram's test, found these six-degree connections to be neither orderly nor random but somewhere in between. These patterns took on an even greater significance when they started examining other types of networks such as electric power grids, human brain cells or the world wide web only to discover clear similarities in all of them. Before returning to the book, let's look at an example given by one of my professors, Dr. Karen Stephenson, during my graduate studies that should help in understanding how these networks are patterned: Think of the organization you work in. Most likely it has some type of hierarchical structure of management. Yet by looking at this pyramid, does it really show how the organization is networked together? It is true that the person at the top holds a lot of decision making power but it is certainly bound to be the case that individuals scattered throughout the ranks wield a disproportional amount of network power. These linchpins are the types of people you go to for questions, information or advice and most certainly others turn to them as well. If every person in the organization drew lines to each person they contacted throughout the day for a question or advice and then all of these drawing were compiled together, you would see a web-like structure emerge. In this web certain people would be crucial "hubs" as they would appear as being connected to a lot of other people as well. Interestingly enough, it is probably the people towards the top of the pyramid who have the fewest connections to others in the organization. This type of network formation exists in all the communities we interact with on a daily basis. Yet how is it that we are connected in such a short number of steps to people on the other side of the globe if we interact only with our local communities? It is by people acting as "bridges" to other groups far beyond the ones we are involved with at a local level. The exchange student you still keep in touch a couple times a year via email serves as a bridge to her entire network of friends and family back home. Lose connection with her and this whole world (even if you are in no way actively apart of it) disappears. As stated earlier, this network layout applies to other areas of science as well. One of the more vivid examples is the development of the world wide web. Internet pages are being developed randomly and frequently. However if you look at the links between all of the billions of web pages, you find once again Internet pages acting as "hubs" and a certain order to the random development. What it also means based on the study that examined the network of the web is that even as another billion webpages are added, the number of clicks required to navigate will not change by more than one or two clicks. These "small world networks" thus make information, electricity or gossip travel much faster than a world without them. When I was home in Seattle a few months ago I took a trip to my favorite book store, The Elliott Bay Book Company , in Pioneer Square - the city's most historic neighborhood. Unfortunately, it was most likely my last visit at its current location. The bookstore is preparing to move to another part of the city. Considering the fate of many independent bookstores, this outcome is far terrible. And reflecting on it objectively, I should actually be happy. For those of you unfamiliar with Seattle, Pioneer Square captures perhaps the last glimpse into the origins of our modern city. While I have a hard time believing the commercial- residential buildings constructed in the last decade that include a Quizno's Subs and tanning salon on the ground floor will withstand the tests of time from an architectural standpoint, Pioneer Square with its brownstone edifices offered something different. This "difference" also included the aroma of stale beer and urine on the vast majority of its sidewalks. Yes, Pioneer Square is truly dying and with the loss of Elliot Bay it's destined to become an urban carcass of its former self. Notwithstanding the verbal assault by numerous panhandlers and con artists, I thoroughly enjoyed the trips into Pioneer Square to visit the bookstore. There is a certain sense of loss. Yet as I already said, the move will actually benefit me because Elliot Bay will now be located in an area I actually do frequent for its nightlife. It was exactly for this reason that Elliot Bay was forced to move locations after a very difficult last 12 months in terms of sales. An independent bookstore relies on foot traffic, especially in the evening. And you can trust me that those going out in Pioneer Square after dark were not the same market segment likely to pop into the reading room to hear an author present her latest work. I respect Elliot Bay's store as well as its business model and wish it the best of success! We should all be cheering it on as the outcome "post-move" will tell us a lot about what businesses will work and which will fail in the future. One mantra of business strategy is based around the belief that a company must either focus on being a cost leader or a high value-add specialist. Finding yourself in the middle is a recipe for disaster due to the competition you will face from both sides. Elliot Bay Bookstore does not discount its books. In the days of Amazon, I know it is a hard concept to grasp that a bookstore may actually sell its goods at the list price found in small print on the back of the cover. But it is the case. They do this because they clearly recognize that a war based on price cannot be won against the likes of online retailers or massive chain stores. What they do offer is exceptional staff who know what they are talking about. My favorite thing to do there (and what can also be done in an excellent music or wine shop) is to go in with a set amount you want to spend, say $100, and let them recommend different books for you based on your interest. It is a great way to get guidance in new directions you may have not normally ventured and it is not something Amazon can offer you - even though they try. However, as this move is eluding to, the specialization they are offering may still not be enough. It is my belief that our ever enduring quest for low prices is devastating large aspects of value and we are not fully aware of it. This value is what lies between a normal versus a basement bottom price. Before parting on too extreme of a tangent, I will just say that the subject of pricing will be further addressed in an upcoming post. And how is this connected to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ? I was in Madrid last July. It was a balmy afternoon and we had made an appointment to meet a friend who was getting off work for her lunch hour. She arrived toting the huge, hardback copy of this book. She was in full addiction mode and was unwilling to part with it even on her lunch break. During my discussion with a salesperson at Elliot Bay a few months back, I noticed my basket of books becoming disproportionately overrepresented with non-fiction and I therefore asked him for a good piece of 2009 fiction. He pointed me towards this book and thinking back on my friend in Madrid, I grabbed it without hesitating. It is certainly an engrossing story which combines mystery, sex, violence and Sweden. I consumed it in a couple of days much in the same way I would plow through a good TV series if I had the whole thing on DVD. It is entertainment above all else. Subtitle: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals I have confessed in other postings that my background in philosophy is far from profound. However, it is a subject (in a very broad definition) that is calling out to me with greater regularity. I have read few of the great works and each attempt to do so thus far has been a struggle. On the other hand, I am always in search of modern day thinkers from whatever academic discipline who are writing about society in a more robust, and shall we say, philosophical context. It is very difficult to do so without tying in the arguments of some of history's great minds and therefore provides me a way to slowly develop a better understanding of some of their principle theses. Wrapped in the discussion of modern society makes it a much less abrupt approach. One of my favorite current writers is Nassim Taleb , renown author of Fooled By Randomness and later The Black Swan . In an interview I saw of him he recommended two modern scholars - Karen Armstrong and John Gray - for their intellectual excellence in their respective fields. Gray is the former professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and author of several books. He has written on globalization, religion and philosophy. As is often the case, shorty after being introduced to him and his works, I came across several articles reviewing a recently published book of his. Straw Dogs was published in 2002. It is a collection of musings stitched together by Gray's underlying belief that humans, in their rather modern distortion of humanist thought, have essentially created a new faith but fails to recognize it as such. This form of humanity, grounded in its roots of Christianity, is based on progress and mankind's ability through such progress to create a better world. Gray argues that "to believe in progress is to believe that, by using the new powers given to us by growing scientific knowledge humans can free themselves from the limits that frame the lives of other animals."T his humanistic vision of progress, outside of science, is a myth fabricated only recently in Western society. It was not long ago when humans thought of themselves as equal to other animals. In many cultures they were even worshiped by humans. Gray recognizes that humans are a highly developed, and incredibly destructive species. Since our arrival in the New World 12,000 years ago, approximately 70% of the world's species have been eliminated which is quickly approaching the same number caused by whatever event, most likely a meteor, wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. At the same time, our destructive species is raging on in fierce debate about how - through science - we can save the earth from the overheating caused by greenhouse gases. Perhaps it is Earth's means of ridding itself us? Ironic to me is how many of the central responses to climate change revolve around the use of elaborately developed technological tools to save us from such overheating. Humans have never been farther removed from nature as they are now. It is through the abandonment of certain forms of technology that we will make the easiest and fastest gains in this battle. Changing the way we eat based on a diet of local vegetables and occasional meat consumption and distancing ourselves from the meat industry would make enormous gains. Walking or bicycling as opposed to the frequent use of the automobile is a very simple concept that proves incredibly difficult to grasp. In a later chapter Gray reminds us that the average American puts in 1600 hours in the car to get 7500 miles: less than five miles per hour. Not much more than what someone would walk in the same time. It is obvious the automobile represents more to us than a form of transportation. Straw Dogs is not a book on environmentalism, however the example demonstrates a certain fallacy in human thought based on scientific progress. Many other such anecdotes make up the remainder of the book though I found they begin to stray more and more from his central thesis along the way. Nonetheless, they are fascinating and provocative. It is a book that does not need to be read from start to end but can be "dipped into at will" as well. Either way, it will get you thinking. After three rather arduous non-fiction reads, I was more than eager for a quick injection of crime mystery, one of my favorite fictional genres. Hammett, most famous for The Maltese Falcon , is certainly one of the most well-regarded American mystery writers. And it was a late night viewing of The Maltese Falcon with its solid performance from Bogart and a quirky and devilish Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo that prompted me to dive further into the works of Hammett. It is clear that Hammett knows what he is writing about after having been a private investigator for many years. His writing style is tight, direct with no superfluous words. In both The Maltese Falcon and The Dain Curse the stories move at a breakneck speed. To be honest, some time the speed and number of characters in the latter was too much for me. I often had to flip back a few chapters to remind myself who was who and what had they done. The book does not disappointment but it did not leave me floored either. What crime/mystery writers do you like? Subtitle: Investment Strategies for the Age of Global Economic Change As 2009 comes to a close and we prepare for the unknowns of 2010, it seems a just time to quickly summarize the current status of our global economy. There is a global shift taking place from the traditional power centers - the U.S. and to a lesser degree Western Europe - towards heavily populated, emerging players. This s
ift, which would have taken place even without the near collapse of our financial system, is now intertwined with the decisions made to stave off disaster over the last year. The United States acted as the motor for growth and consumption over the last fifty years. The American consumer has driven this consumption, especially over the last twenty years, through debt. We are all aware this can no longer occur and a shift towards savings and debt repayment means consumption will have to come from elsewhere. This U.S. led consumption has made an enormous impact on other countries as well. By importing more goods than it exported, the U.S. generated a large current account deficit resulting in the sending of vast sums of US dollars to the exporting countries. Oil producing nations have likewise accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars due to the exporting of oil to the U.S. and other rich world countries. Amassed with US dollars these countries through vehicles such as sovereign wealth fund, are seeking a home for their liquid dollar assets - from homes on the French Riviera to large stakes in Morgan Stanley. As exporting nations have been producing goods for the U.S. at low cost, they have put ever more demand on natural resources (commodities). They have begun to see an upward pressure on wages as their local economies grow. Both of these factors, demand for commodities and increasing wages, will fuel inflation. Add on top of this the government spending in the rich world in the forms of various stimulus plans and inflationary concerns abound even though we are currently in a quasi-deflationary period. Basic demographics are also changing with Europe's population getting older, the US being in between and countries such as Brazil possessing a rather young population. Governments will have to respond accordingly as they struggle to provide the services these population segments require. Demands for certain goods and services will become more relevant based on these shifts. The above encapsulation of global economics is the context within which El-Erian, the world's largest bond investor, and former directer of Harvard's Endowment fund, frames this concise and relevant text. The majority of the book is spent setting the stage for what is to come and what has developed over the last few eventful years. He then attempts to outline measures that can be taken to benefit from these shifts taking place. How as investors can we accumulate the wealth needed to support a prosperous future? And, equally as important, how can we counter balance our portfolios to prevent massive loss through huge downswings in markets or erosion of certain asset classes due to inflationary effects? I am no longer in possession of the book so I can only recall what stayed with me since I read it over one month ago. This will have certainly been meshed together with my own beliefs. Perhaps this is a more useful exercise. Some points for investing in the future: 1. Develop a view of the global economy and dedicate a certain percentage of assets to the shifts you believe likely to occur. If inflation is a concern due to rising wages in Southeast Asia, commodities, real estate or inflation protected securities will be safer bets than cash or certain types of equities. 2. Watch out for "home bias". Investors have the tendency to buy stocks from their home country, especially in the U.S. but also in other countries as well. Active Swedish investors place 48% of their invested money in Swedish stocks even though Sweden makes up 1% of the global economy (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). Investing in what you know makes sense up to a certain degree but does not warrant such a disproportional approach. This is equally true in the States where a robust and transparent equity market warrants a large percentage of investment focus but not the absurdly high percentages most Americans have in their home market. 3. Emerging Market Government Bonds can essentially be grouped with more traditional bond types as their government balance sheets are in healthier shape than many more traditional markets, e.g. Greece and Ireland. To claim The Prize to be a book on the history of oil already by such definition limits the impact this commodity has had on the development of society over the last 150 years. What it really is is an analysis of global economic and military history over this time period framed within the context of oil. The book begins by concentrating on the historic period before World War I when Winston Churchill, as civilian head of the Royal Navy, began to see the importance of replacing the coal fired fleets of the British navy with those using oil in order to gain in speed and agility. Yergin chooses this as his starting point, even though he then moves back 60 years to the true founding, because this was an important turning point in how oil was used. It was at this time when oil became a "disruptive technology" as it moved from an energy source mainly used for providing light to one that would become the standard form of fuel for all transportation. After this introduction, The Prize returns to its chronological unfolding using as the starting point a key series of scientific discoveries regarding oil's potential uses and then later to the first wave of major U.S. discoveries. Though oil's history can be dated back long before this, the foundation of oil as an industry and major fuel source has an American heritage. . In 1859 the Drake Well in central Pennsylvania was hit thus sparking the first wave of oil mania. This mania brought all types of people from expert scientists and geologists to green thumb enthusiasts with nothing to lose. The creation of boom towns in desolate parts of the U.S. became common. These towns would quickly be erected often to satisfy the needs of the fortune seekers (booze and prostitution). Means for distributing the oil would be hastily devised with a very short term approach to get the black liquid to far off markets. Once the source showed signs of reduced volumes or a bigger source was discovered elsewhere, the towns would quickly find their streets and brothels empty. The comparisons between the boom towns and the massive cookie cutter neighborhoods erected in the last five years in the States during our latest housing boom are strikingly similar. The next part of the book explores how the fragmented industry, from finding the oil to distributing it, paved the way for on opportunity of massive levels of consolidation and vertical integration. It was seized and later exploited mainly by one man - John Rockefeller of Standard Oil. Rockefeller bought other oil companies both large and small, keeping the efficient ones and merely closing down the others to limit any potential threat of competition. Standard Oil was the first true monopoly in the U.S., controlling 90% of the oil derivative, kerosene. Its dominance led way to growing discontent of the American public who lacked alternatives to Standard Oil products and became more aware of the incredible fortune being amassed by Rockefeller as a result. In 1911 the Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil be split into 32 different regional companies who would then compete with each other for customers and markets. World War I was a very labor intensive struggle fought and won in the trenches with limited reliance on machinery. World War II, as painted by Yergin , was a war in which oil played a decisive role in the outcome. Both Japan and Germany lacked domestic sources of oil and were therefore dependent on other countries, namely Romania and Indonesia, to provide the oil needed to power their ships, planes and tanks. The lack of this crucial resource and the failure in certain cases to effectively distribute it to the divisions in need led to losses at key junctures in World War II events . An interesting example is how German troops, led by the brilliant Rommel, were unable to seize control North Africa to the extent desired because at key battles they were without fuel needed to power their panzer tanks. The U.S. and Russia were instead at a particular advantage because they could rely on domestic fuel sources. An agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. also meant Britain, whose North Sea source would not be found until decades later, was also able to receive its needed share of American oil. However, having access domestically is only one part needed for success. How you manage your operations is another. Yergin's description of a floating fuel station comprised of numerous ships and tankers that were able to provide fuel to other ship fleets in the South Pacific was fascinating. Though the author dedicated several chapters explaining why Japan and Germany were greatly hindered by their lack of oil, I found the book thin on other examples of Allied success. The post-World War II era led to the rise of what Yergin defines as the "the Hydrocarbon man", i.e. the individual consumer who developed an ever growing thirst for oil. It also was the period of the oil producing dominance of the Middle East region. The book is probably at its strongest here. It brilliantly explains how the major oil companies established themselves with marketing (downstream) channels in the consuming countries and favorable partnerships with Middle Eastern countries. By providing technical expertise in this region they were given a disproportionately large share of the revenue generated from each new barrel. Later Yergin clearly explains how OPEC was born and the economic significance it played in the market - essentially by controlling two levers - setting supply levels as well as prices per barrel. The 800-page book is referred to as "the Bible" of oil history. The magnitude of this industry in terms of global scale and historical importance over the last 150 years means that in order to effectively write one, all-encompassing volume a certain high level approach and style is necessary. Yergin succeeds in incorporating the macro level history and economic connections oil has played over this time period. However, by taking such an approach it is inevitable that some other aspects regarding such an important subject will be less adequately addressed. I respect the focus Yergin took in writing the book and his unrelenting ability not to defer from it. However, there were two main faults I found in doing so. The impression he gave when discussing the "hydrocarbon man" and his insatiable thirst for oil was that the oil companies were passively responding to the demand for their product that was being begged for by consumers. However it was never discussed how this demand was stimulated to such excessive levels. What was lacking in the text was an adequate explanation as to why consumption levels grew at such astounding rates over these years. What were the relationships like between the auto manufactures and the oil companies? Certainly these industries were strongly connected to the centers of power in Washington D.C. yet was never mentioned. Hydrocarbon man became dependent on the automobile due to lack of alternatives. The classic example of the removal of all tram lines in Los Angeles certainly encouraged such behavior yet it, nor any other relevant example was even eluded to. And why were such large vehicles in such demand? Yergin refers to the adaption of the first fuel economy standards in 1975 of 27.5 mile per gallon within 10 years as revolutionary step which led to a drastic reduction in oil consumption. Though the book was published in 1990, a few years prior to the SUV boom, it is hard for his praise of such regulation not to ring hollow considering the impressive gas mileage of the Ford Expeditions and other "light trucks" exempt from these standards. Such SUVs went on to make up 50% of all vehicle sales in the U.S. The automakers gained on the higher profit margins of these vehicles as well as special deprecation status they were granted for business purposes. Oil companies also make more money the more often consumers need to fill up their cars. Such a thrust by automakers towards these types of vehicles certainly pushed hydrocarbon man's demand for oil. These type of factors were absent in his book. The focus of The Prize as a work of economic history also meant that the small time victims of such a massive industry were ignored. As someone who is far from an expert on the industry, I am still aware of tragic stories such as the one of Ken Saro - Wiwa's , who fought against Shell and the Nigerian government because of the environmental damage the oil drilling was causing in the Niger delta. A reference, at least collectively, to the victims of the oil industry as well as the environmental impact it has made was something due in the book yet was nowhere to be found. Regardless, The Prize is required reading for those on all sides of the debate as it provides the foundation to what has become the lubricant of our daily lives. Ah, France! This novel, with such French attitude, scoffs at the wealthy for their shallowness, as well as their unmerited sense of cultural superiority over the social classes below them. Barbery does this by focusing her story around two central characters: the door-woman of an elegant resident building in central Paris and the twelve year old daughter of one of the families living in the building. Both of these characters are made to be the most culturally and intellectually astute individuals in the novel, much more so than the barbarians that grace the floors of the building. It would be easy to dismiss the stereotypes portrayed of French society as cliche', however, they are made so apparent throughout the novel that their blatancy somehow makes them comical. Instead, the subtler aspects of the book touch on more philosophical arguments regarding such subjects as art, beauty, the purpose of life, and human existence - shall we say the pain et beurre of French intellectual thought. The story is simple and for this reason pleasurable. The door-woman, Ms. Michel, lives what at first glance appears to be a monotonous life, ignored by the inhabitants of the building. However, she finds comfort in this solitude and actually makes all efforts possible to draw as little attention to herself as possible. To do so she must hide all her intellectual pursuits as not to raise any questions in the eyes of the pseudo-intellects around her. However, they are probably too stupid to pick up on them anyway. When Ms. Michel is not reading Russian literature, she is hammering away at the shallow and miserable lives of the rich around her. There is a certain sense of irony here since the pursuits such as shopping, shampooing hair multiple times and wearing make- up are looked down upon by her that is until she catches the eye of a new resident to the building - Mr. Oke , a retired Japanese. Mr. Oke , being someone truly steeped in culture and intellectual capacity is quickly able to see how the door-woman is not a typical type. He then begins inviting her to various activities much as Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman . The response of Ms. Michel is not much different in that those superficial activities of the wealthy become appealing as soon as someone comes along who is interested in her. When compared to modern American novels, this book is more layered in that it offers a straightforward story of its characters but also dives deeper into more philosophical discussions. There are a lot of cultural references as well. What I see as being the major difference when compared to modern American novels is how Barberry writes to a more educated, cultured audience than most writers do in the States. As this book was the bestselling one in France over the last couple of years, we can assume therefore, that it was read by people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. Heaven help us if it had only remained in the upper echelons of French society! The subtitle is "making art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy" I do not want to start off this post by saying something cliche' like any working in ecommerce , new media, or Internet services should read this book though the temptation is there. Instead I will say that in my own line of work this book has already given me a new way to approach
apologies for the long absence... i think that i just needed to fall off the planet after all the mayhem and recuperate for the gruelling last four years... so as you guys are all probably aware i have been trying my hand at things other than shooting... so have been doing a few commercials, giving speeches, been doing a lot of stuff with my dogs, have been busy in the office with a few projects and it has been amazing been staying away from the shooting range...although i have to admit that i do feel a twinge of desire to go and shoot everytime i walk past the range but i am going to make sure that i am completely rested and relaxed both physically and mentally before i decide to venture down that road...it has been a long and ardous last couple of months and i am happy to have some normalcy returning to my life... my phone no longer ringing off the hook and things are great....i hosted my coaches to india for the first time and have been busy taking them around...so we made the trip to agra, and jaipur and it was great actually hanging out with them and not talking that much shooting...so guys fret not...will keep all informed regularly... at least everytime i have news and that may not be as often as you guys like :) but hey i am just a simple guy living in a mundane existence...
Last Monday I attended Womadelaide, a 'world music' festival that was run over 4 days. On stage here was Xavier Rudd, suported by two South African musicians in a lively performance in which he plays  guitar, digeridoo and an assortment of percussion instruments.The last few weeks has been extra busy for Adelaidians as we have had plenty of special activities to attend; in addition to Womadelaide was the Fringe, Writers Week, the Festival of Arts and the Clipsal 500 - and all of them had record numbers of people attending. Now today I can catch my breath and start blogging again because it is all over! Part of the old Henley jetty forms the centre piece of the Artist Bar; constructed for the Adelaide Festival. Underneath the jetty is the bar where you might rub shoulders with a star or two; it was reported last week that Tom Jones was seen here.The ABC Wednesday meme was initiated by Denise Nesbitt. To find out more about ABC Wednesdays and see other participants' contributions click here. A bit of nostalgia in the park. As part of the 2010 Adelaide Festival the Rotunda in Elder Park has been transformed to display Super 8 home movies; edited by Richard Raber and Naomi Bishop from hundreds of hours of film donated by South Australians. My post last Tuesday was about Amococo; a luminarium in Adelaide for the Fringe. On Thursday I experienced it for myself - truly amazing and so relaxing.Some people just walked around experiencing all the amazing colour blends; others sat and c
A story today from the nation’s capital that reinforces our latest lawsuit : the city of Ottawa is using federal stimulus cash (and avoiding any environmental assessment) to run a highway through several endangered species' habitat. It’s one example of many municipalities seeking to benefit from the federal spending spree. There have been several ridiculous justifications given for reckless stimulus spending. One such argument is that environmental assessments on these infrastructure projects is too costly – but of the $24 billion in spending, only 1% of that would be necessary to ensure environmental assessments are completed that reduce the toll on the surrounding land, water and species. When we drop billions of dollars into the ever-growing deficit budget, one would hope it’s being done with vision, values and care – unfortunately, the relative temporary suffering created by this economic downturn could wreak long-term damages to our life-sustaining systems for generations to come. Ecojustice and the Canadian Cancer Society are taking action against a disturbing federal government trend that is seeing fewer and fewer dangerous chemicals making it onto the list of regulated contaminants. Here’s some history on toxics in Canada: There are thousands of potentially harmful substances used domestically and abroad that make their way into our food, products, water and air, causing cancers, birth defects and a host of diseases. The government shortlisted about 4000 chemicals that will potentially harm human health or the environment, and prioritized 200 of these into 12 batches - we’re currently assessing Batch 6. If found to be toxic, a chemical placed on the Toxic Substances List is strictly regulated and managed under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act [ CEPA ]. The disconcerting trend we’re seeing is one where less and less chemicals being assessed are making their way on to the Toxic Substances List, with just one of the 14 to make the list in Batch 6. Industry and government do not appear willing to produce the much-needed missing information on how these chemicals may enter the environment, and worse still they are using this lack of data as a lack of proof to justify keeping potentially toxic chemicals off of the Toxic Substances List. That’s why we’re sounding the alarm bells at Health Canada and Environment Canada on toxic chemicals and the precautionary principle. “Precautionary” means that instead of using the current gaps in knowledge to justify keeping chemicals off the federal list, this principle places the burden of proof on industry to show how these chemicals will not harm human or environmental health. Ecojustice helped establish the precautionary principle in Canada at the Supreme Court back in 2001, and we’re working to ensure that this responsible approach comes through in the way Canada protects its citizens from dangerous chemicals. CEPA clearly outlines how the precautionary principle should guide government’s thinking, and our challenge to Environment and Health Canada is to focus on this principle in their decisions that have vast implications for our health and our future. Sometimes all it takes is some information and outrage to make meaningful change in our community. It’s happening near Sudbury, Ontario, where Simon Lake Community Stewardship is taking up the cause of sewage dumping in their community - moved to action as a result of our latest water quality report “ Flushing Out the Truth: Sewage Dumping in Ontario .” Their letter-writing campaign targets Ontario Minister of Environment John Gerretsen with the message that “dumping untreated and under-treated sewage into our watersheds is not acceptable.” These disgusting yet all-too-common events have become standard practice in municipalities, as noted in our report: “In both 2006 and 2007, raw or undertreated sewage was dumped more than 1,000 times by Ontario municipalities. The quantities are staggering, with billions of litres escaping full treatment each year.” We pride ourselves on our report-writing rigour, and when they inform and inspire communities to stand up for their rights we are doubly pleased. If you’re in the Sudbury area, support their campaign with a letter of your own. For those outside of Sudbury, see our report to find out how your community is doing when it comes to responsible sewage treatment and let us know your thoughts. When it comes to endangered species, we’re looking for ways to avoid the ‘litigation as law enforcement’ model we’ve had to take to get action for the most vulnerable organisms and ecosystems in Canada. One big step forward would be better provincial laws for endangered species, and in British Columbia there is hope that may just happen. The feds already have a law, the Species at Risk Act , though we’ve consistently needed to take them to court to implement each incremental step the Act requires to protect species and their habitat. And federal law does not apply automatically on provincial land, except to aquatic species and migratory birds, but most land in Canada is provincial, only a minority of species are aquatic or migratory birds. Meanwhile, most provinces have yet to introduce legal protections for species and the habitat they depend on - greatly reducing our chances of ensuring that these species survive, let alone recover. That might be changing in British Columbia, where we’re seeing talk that may lead to a meaningful species at risk law. Thanks in part to a multi-year effort by Ecojustice and our coalition partners highlighting the need for such a law , the BC government announced plans in its August Throne speech to create a Species-at-Risk Task Force. The team will be tasked with developing a new vision for endangered species protection in collaboration with the people of BC, and Ecojustice will be watching closely to see that this initiative delivers a much-needed endangered species law; as of now, the task force is yet to be created. BC is Canada’s richest province biologically, but already at least 43% of BC’s +3800 species are at risk of disappearing. With a successful task force and a new provincial law we can end the current ‘ death watch ’ of endangered species in BC and provide a model for the rest of Canada. This morning at 9:45 a.m. we received word that we won our Supreme Court case concerning the Red Chris mine! We’ve been waiting for this ruling since we presented our case last October, and it’s a monumental victory for us, for the environment, and for public participation that will benefit Canadians for years to come. The Court ruled that the Canadian government violated the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act when it split the project into artificially small parts to avoid a comprehensive assessment and public consultation. Despite the significant environmental risks posed by this mine, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Natural Resources Canada limited their assessment to a fraction of the mine proposal, removing the actual mine from its environmental review and rubber-stamping a provincial assessment. The Court has ruled that, in the future, the public must now be consulted about major industrial projects, such as large metal mines and tar sands developments. “The Supreme Court has given Canadians back their voice and, with it, their ability to influence major industrial development across the country,” said Ecojustice lawyer Lara Tessaro, who represented MiningWatch Canada on the case. “This landmark decision confirms that the government can no longer shirk the environmental protection duties that Parliament has assigned to it.” The proposed Red Chris mine is located near the Sacred Headwaters, the birthplace of Northern BC’s three greatest salmon rivers – the Stikine, Nass and the Skeena. Called “the Serengeti of the North” for its rich biodiversity, the area’s wildlife and waterways are severely threatened by the project. Most shocking of all, the mine seeks to wipe out pristine Black Lake by converting it into a “tailings impoundment area” – a dumpsite for toxic mine waste. And while the ruling did not stop the Red Chris mine from going forward, contrary to some industry reports this does not mean that the mine has been approved. Ecojustice and Mining watch will continue to follow the project throughout the future federal permitting process, and will oppose any permits that threaten our lakes and rivers, or that risk the health of the Sacred Headwaters area. In the meantime, we have successfully secured stronger environmental accountability for future projects throughout the country. We’ll continue to fight the Canadian government policy of turning lakes into tailings dumps, in BC and across the country. Thanks to this win, our efforts will be even more successful in the future. The Globe and Mail recently wrote that “it may only be a matter of time before the battle over global warming moves into a courtroom.” In fact, Ecojustice has already taken it there, and we’re now waiting to hear if our case , Canada’s first global warming lawsuit, will be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. Our landmark legal challenge argues that the Harper government is breaking Canadian law by failing to comply with the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act (KPIA). Despite being passed in 2007, the government has ignored the Act and failed to enact the legally binding climate change regulations it calls for. Meanwhile, the Conservative’s plan to address climate change doesn’t come close to reaching the greenhouse gas targets that we have committed to achieving. Given Harper’s repeated reference to our climate change obligations as unrealistic and unachievable , it’s not surprising that we have weak reduction targets and industry-friendly standards in the place of leadership, action or regulation. The Harper government’s lack of regard for this law, combined with reports of their obstructionist tactics at last month’s Copenhagen talks, leaves Canada wide open to harsh criticism from governments, groups and citizens taking action on the climate crisis – we will see what our top court has to say about this disregard in the coming months. We’ll keep the climate cases, solutions and results coming in the new year - looks like we have our work cut out for us. We were in court yesterday, taking a hard look at Ontario’s approaches to land use planning and sustainable development - particularly decision-making at the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB). The case involves a proposed golf course and condo development slated for the highly-sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine . The 120-acre development has already been rejected by the local municipality, but that matter is being challenged by the developers at the OMB. At risk is the integrity of the Oak Ridges Moraine itself, and good environmental decision-making in general. We are there with our client Earthroots to ensure that challenges such as this one are heard by both the OMB and the Environmental Review Tribunal (ERT), convening a hearing panel together as a joint board . Green-leaning Ontarians have witnessed the developer-friendly atmosphere created by the OMB in the past, and have seen some very questionable decisions where efforts to promote local and environmental values have been lost. Environmental decision-making expertise in this province is found at the ERT, and in matters where planning and environment meet, a consolidated OMB/ERT hearing can better assess land use disputes with a greater eye towards sustainable development. There’s a public interest in joining together land use and environmental protection decisions, avoiding multiple hearings on a single project, and integrating the land use issues with the ecosystem and drinking water source concerns posed by this proposed new development. A decision on whether or not this challenge will go forward at the OMB alone, or a as consolidated OMB/ERT hearing, should be made in the next several weeks – we’ll keep you updated as the results come in. As Canadian kids of the Christmas persuasion impatiently eye the boxes beneath the tree, it’s good to know that our hard work on product safety will translate into better protection for them from toxic chemicals in their toys and our homes. Coming on the heels of the proposed ban for the toxic substance DecaBDE in electronics we helped achieve earlier this year in Canada, the US EPA announced last week that several American companies are following in our footsteps by phasing out the manufacturing of this prevalent but highly toxic fire retardant. DecaBDE , is used in everything from video game consoles and TVs to drapes and furniture. It accumulates in breast milk, fish and birds to cause liver, thyroid and developmental problems in humans and wildlife. The voluntary decision by these companies is to be applauded, and we are glad to see that Ecojustice’s senior scientist Dr. Elaine MacDonald was out in front on this issue. Given this announcement by the chemical companies that make DecaBDE, Ecojustice will ask Canada to broaden its proposed ban on DecaBDE from electronics to a total ban on all uses DecaBDE. We’re also pushing hard to keep the lead-ridden kids toys off the Canadian market by making science- and legally-based submissions supporting a strong and effective Bill C-6, the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. It’s encouraging to see Canada leading a forward-thinking and precautionary approach towards environmental and human health. As the feds implement their deca ban in electronics, and the House considers C6’s product monitoring and enforcement changes, we’ll continue to hold our leaders accountable on behalf of the public. Look forward to hearing more about our toxics research and legal actions in the new year. Have a happy and healthy holiday!
If you're familiar with my last AER9, you'll recall that the project was completed in only 4 days. I recently had a chance to take another whack at it with a much more lenient deadline, and I'm very, very happy with the results. The basic steps at the beginning were the same as my last build. Make a blueprint, transcribe it to wood, and start cutting, gluing and clamping. I did discover a random and somewhat neat trick for scribing the lines on this though. By printing to vellum on an injket printer, I was able to directly transfer the pattern of the print from the paper to the wood. Using laquer thinner brushed over the ink, I burnished the paper against the MDF and the lines transferred perfectly! Made transcribing my blueprints MUCH easier. The main difference between this build and my last is the materials used. Outside of the stock base, barrel, grip and MF cell, all other parts were made from sintra, styrene, or aluminum. These materials can take detail much better than MDF which afforded me a lot of control in making the shape more accurate. I also decided to use LEDs for a glowing barrel effect. This was a preliminary test-fire to see how the idea would work. In the end, I used the lens out of a laser pointer behind the center hole in the barrel to focus the light and make it brighter in that spot. After the barrel and stock were shaped to the correct dimensions, I started adding details in sintra &amp; styrene. The rounded edges on the back and front parts were made by gluing the sintra into a box and rounding the edges on my table router. Another huge difference in this build was my new lathe. The AER9 has a TON of little rounded bits all over it. These were cut out of MDF or sintra. The microfusion cell is 4 pieces of MDF glued together and shaped on the lathe as well. This rear knob is also lathed MDF. The tube which sits on top of the barrel is an ABS rod. This was a lot easier to shape than the 5/16" steel tube I used on the last build. Here's most of the parts going on for a test fit. The grip is an MDF block with sintra strips shaped over it. To keep a uniform shape, I heat-formed one sheet over the entire grip, then cut it into strips on my bandsaw. The rear of the barrel is a sintra box with styrene accents. The curved part behind the MF cell was sculpted out of apoxie sculpt and sanded to shape. Various other smaller bits were shaped out of sintra/styrene before going to primer. Below is the trigger &amp; trigger arm, MF cell area, barrel, cell eject lever, and other bits. I also scribed the panel lines on the parts with a lino block carving tool I had left over from my art school days. Another test assembly after all the parts had been primed. I had some really tight tolerances when putting it together, as the layers of paint actually made it quite hard to get the front and rear casings over the barrel. Yay precision! To power the LEDs, I used 2 AA batteries housed in an in-line battery holder. The knob on the back of the gun unscrews to reveal the battery door to replace the cells. I was very very happy with how this turned out. The LEDs are switched on and off by a hidden pushbutton switch on the bottom of the rifle barrel. The last lathed part was the bottom support bar. This was carved from a pine dowel and cored out to receive a hollow aluminum bar. Styrene accents finished it off. I also found some knurled nuts to use for the two circular parts on the support bar and JB welded them in place. On to paint! The basecoat silver was done with Krylon chrome paint. After this, I dusted the surface with a darker silver by holding the can about 2 feet away from the part and spraying lightly over the entire surface. This gave the paint a stippled texture like cast aluminum would have (this is shown a little better on the front barrel casing in the shot below with the barrel painted green.) Color was done with Testors spray paint for the barrel (which is annoyingly thin and loves to run) and Testors brush paint for the silver on the MF cell and upper pipe. After this, each individual part got a coat of clear to protect the finish. I know I'm going to get a ton of decal questions, so I hope this answers them preemptively. It seems like custom decals are the bane of every replica maker, and it took me a bit to figure out the best way to do it as well. As with my Portal Gun, the AER9 got water-slide decals on the MF cell for the warning messages, arrows, and stripe. These were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed onto water-slide decal paper on a laserjet printer. The barrel decals were done differently. The barrel was scanned on a computer scanner to pick up the color &amp; texture of the paint. Then, I designed the side decals in Illustrator, taking them into Photoshop to layer them over the green background and weather them a bit before printing. These were output on adhesive-backed vinyl using a plotter, then applied to the gun. There is a slight seam line around the sides of these, but its only evident under close inspection. Here's the gun all assembled and shiny brand-new! So pretty, so clean... So needs a few coats of grime. This was the first pass. Another new tool I had for this build was an airbrush. I'd never used one before, so this was as much a practice run as it was a weathering effort. It took some getting used to, but I was very satisfied with the results. NOTE: If you don't seal inkjet decals before acrylic paint weathering, they will run &amp; bleed! This is why I clearcoated the gun before this process. I also made a display board for the gun to sit on, in maple. This was stained satin black. Here's the final shots of the gun after all the weathering was completed and given another coat of clear to protect the finish. I am very glad I got to revisit this piece, but I don't think I'll be making another one. 2 was plenty for me, and its time to try another project with my newfound techniques and materials. These pics and more build images are all available on my flickr page , in much higher resolutions. Thanks for reading! New year, new projects, new deadlines. And, if I'm honest, some old deadlines from last year too. Here's a few of the projects that I've got on various burners that will be featured in the coming months: AER9 Laser Rifle ( Fallout 3 ) Thats right, I'm doing this again. The last one was a very rushed build and I would have loved to have more time to get the details to my liking. On this project, I can! I learned a lot from the first AER9 and all of that trial-by-fire will be applied to this project. Things are moving fast, so I may have a finished product very soon. Among the improvements are a moving trigger, screenprinted labels, and an illuminated barrel! Force-a-Nature ( Team Fortress 2 ) This project is also moving quickly, though I wish I'd taken more pictures of the process. The proportions of this gun are ridiculous - the barrels hold a 4 gauge round and are only 7.25" long! This will be a heavy and robust piece when completed. I have a neat collaboration going on with a fellow who is maching some aluminum parts for it too, can't wait to show those off! Chell's Heelsprings ( Portal ) These poor things have been sitting in 90% limbo for a while now, awaiting a few minor bits to make them perfect. We have a Portal photoshoot coming up in the near future, so hopefully they will be back on the table soon. Link's Hylian Shield ( Zelda: Twilight Princess ) My first shield was also my first real "prop". When I first took a crack at this, the entire shape was eyeballed and I didn't know my materials very well. On top of that, I didn't take any progress photos! This shield will rectify a lot of the issues of the old one, mostly the major inaccuracies and cumbersome weight of my first project. All this, and more, in 2010. Thanks for reading! We did it! After two months of back-and-forth with the PR reps at the Georgia Aquarium, we were allowed to bring Big Daddy in for a photoshoot! This was a colossal effort, and just like the original display of the piece, several hands went into making it happen. Much thanks to my friend Kim and Jay for getting up at 5am to come with us and be our handlers, to the Georgia Aquarium staff for this amazing opportunity, and to Matt Nicholson (and his fiancée!) of Dim Horizon Studio for doing such fantastic photography and editing. Big Daddy is currently for sale ! Check this eBay listing , which ends on 12/03/09 - just in time for the holidays! Nothing says "I love you" quite like a hulking murder machine. I hope you guys enjoy these photos as much as I have been. Edit: 11.24.09 - Select wallpaper sized files now available for download!

They do offer private photoshoots for individuals and businesses, and they take place before business hours so you can have a crowd-free session. Our photoshoot took place between 8 and 10am, so we didn't disturb the normal flow of customer traffic. If you want to contact the Georgia Aquarium about doing a private photoshoot of your own, check out this form . There were divers cleaning the insides of the tanks when we first arrived, and as we began our shoot, some of them started to crowd around and look at what was taking place. Definitely an odd experience when you're the one being looked at from the inside of the fish tank. Its easy to see the biggest change in the suit: LEDs! I added light diffusion panels to the dome of the Big Daddy for this shoot, and I'm very glad I did. I also added foam padding around the shoulders, hips, and knees in order to fill out the suit a bit more and prevent that stick-like effect that showed up in some of the photography from DragonCon. As with before, I owe all the sewing credit to my fiancée, Emily. She's also the creepy-as-hell Little Sister in these shots.

I have been getting a TON of requests/inquiries about the Daft Punk helmet. Most of these emails have very similar questions, so I figured I'd make a quick Q&amp;A post that I can reference which will hopefully answer everyone at once. If you don't want to read all the copy below, I don't blame you. I do tend to ramble. Summary: Currently I cannot recreate these with a zero margin of error. I have gone through several casts in order to get one with a perfect finish to send along to my client. I do not believe in selling my work to someone unless it is flawless, and as of now there are still issues with this process. Due to this, I cannot take any orders for replicas of finished helmets. Q : Is the helmet for sale? A : No, this helmet was built for a client of mine and was constructed specifically for him. Unless he wants to sell it (not likely!) it is not available for purchase. Q : Will you make me a helmet/are there other replicas you're willing to sell? A : There are 2 parts to this answer. Firstly, I am currently booked until April, and cannot take any commissions in May or June due to my wedding and honeymoon. Any work I do is purely first-come, first-served, and I am not taking commission reservations at this time. When I open up again to take reservations for 2010, I will post on here. Projects will very likely fill up quickly, so look out for updates in December/January! Secondly, there are not currently any copies available for sale, and I cannot definitively say there ever will be. At this time, there are still issues with chroming the plastic helmets. Also, I don't have a continued source for visor vacuum-forming. I do not own my own vac-forming machine, and BlindSquirrel did the first run as a favor to me. He has plenty of his own work to see to and I do not want to impose on him to continue these for me. The short answer is this: I am only making 2 finished helmets. One for me, and one for my client. That is all there will be until April. If someone is interested in another one, be sure to check back on my blog in December/January for when I will be taking reservations again . Q : Will you make/Have you made Thomas' helmet? A : I have not, but plans are in the works. This build will start in mid 2010. Again, like above, please note that the initial helmet will be made for my client ONLY. Any other requests will follow my standard commission queue. Q : How much will a finished helmet cost with the LED effects? A : During the course of this project, it has become remarkably apparent to me as to why the real helmets fetch a $64,000 price. This stuff is intricate, finicky, and expensive. I do not disclose client final pricing on projects, but I can say that certain things carried a hefty price tag. Custom PCBs for the lighting run about $250/helmet, the LEDs themselves cost $150/helmet, and the electrical components (Arduino board, transistors, resistors, plugs, wires, etc etc etc) totaled over $300. That alone is $700, and thats just materials cost for blinking lights! I hope that gives some idea of the scope of the rest of the project. Q : Can I buy a raw cast from the mold to make a helmet on my own? A : EDIT: I AM TAKING A BREAK FROM OFFERING RESIN HELMETS. The mold has started to show some wear after making 25 copies, and I also need time to finish other projects. Resin copies are now on hold, indefinitely. Q : Can I have your schematics/plans/illustrations/research notes? A : On some scale, yes. My schematics are included in my client's budget; this is the case with all of my builds. Their payments cover the time in research and drawing of these plans. If you like, I can provide you with hi-res .eps, .pdf, or .ai files to help you in your build for a small fee. Keep in mind that typically these blueprints are the result of several hours of research and planning, then even more time drawing. I hope that answers some of the questions I've been getting about the helmet, and I truly am appreciative of all the attention its been getting. If I had the ability to make one for every person who has asked, I would! However, I am only one guy, working in his spare time at home. I can't possibly take orders for dozens of replicas, and I'm just plain uneasy about booking out time way too far in advance. To everyone who has asked me about these replicas: Thank You for your interest and your support of my work! Again, I really wish I could help out all the people who have sent me inquiries, but one guy can only do so much. Finally, because I hate posts without pictures, here's a few images to tide everyone over until I can send out some finished shots of the helmet in all its blinking glory: And one teaser video... I'll explain all of these in the next entry of the Daft Punk helmet saga; Part 3: Electronics ! EDIT: For information regarding replicas of this prop, please see THIS POST In the last post I had about this build, I ended with the finished master, ready for molding: Silicone, silicone, silicone. Layered in stages, with registration keys and marks for the mother mold. The mother mold was made with Plasti-paste. In retrospect, this makes for a very heavy mold that gives you some sore shoulders after slushcasting, and fiberglass may have been a better idea. At least its sturdy! The detail captured in the silicone was perfect! Some resin pulls. I started off with smoothcast 320, but it proved difficult to make a nice, thin pull. After switching to smoothcast 300, things got a bit more to my liking. Couldn't help walking around in one. I trimmed out a casting of the visor to make the vacuum-former mold for the visors. This was mounted to a flat board so PETG plastic could be pulled over it. Ear areas were trimmed out for the LEDs and black plate that sits in the cones. The trimmed and sanded helmets were given a coat of primer and wet sanded to take out any minor imperfections in the resin surface. I need to take a minute aside here to go on a personal rant, and I apologize in advance for that because the last thing I want my blog to become is my own personal
soapbox. This project is a large and complex one, and due to that there were certain things I had to farm out to other vendors and craftsmen. Specifically, the chrome gold plating of the resin and the vacuum-forming of the visors. I don't possess the tooling to do either of these, so I had to look elsewhere. Metalizing: Initially, I had planned on going to M&amp;M Metalizing for my gold chrome work. Over the phone estimates placed the process at $125 per helmet. I agreed, and sent two of the ones you see above (wetsanded and prepped) for finishing. The day after sending the package and an email confirming they were en route with tracking number, I received a phonecall from M&amp;M. The price had risen to $175 per helmet, without much in the way of explanation. I was in a bind an under a deadline, and I agreed. The day the package was arrived, I got another call saying that gold plating carried an additional $25 surcharge per part. This increased my original price of $250 for 2 helmets to now $400, plus return shipping. Angry, I requested they be shipped to another company for plating. M&amp;M then charged me (COD with no invoice) $100 for 2-day return shipping. Next-day air had cost me $46 less than a week before. This is the condition the helmets arrived in at the other shop: You can see the damage to certain areas noted by the arrows ( larger version here ) The helmets were not packaged in the box; merely thrown on top of the wrapping I had sent previously (they had been sent out by me wrapped very carefully in foam and bubble wrap to prevent the above from happening.) Additionally, the helmets themselves were greasy with fingerprints and other oils, which would have caused major imperfections in the finish. I offer this story as an caution – and hopefully warnings like this will come infrequently – to anyone who reads these posts of mine looking for similar processes. As someone who relies very heavily on reputation in order to have a continued supply of business, I don't see how anyone can operate in this manner. My contact there was generally abrasive on the phone, and obviously cared very little for my continued patronage. Vacuum-forming: Mike (BlindSquirrel), a fellow prop builder over at My Dumb Projects , took care of the vac-forming for me. Mike is a fantastic guy, an amazing craftsman, and his work on this project well exceeded my expectations. Actually, his patience was the best part, as my mold proved to be a frustrating piece of kit to work with (mostly because I didn't know how to build a proper vacuum-former mold) Eventually he worked out the kinks, with stellar results: The visor was tinted on the inside with car tail-light paint, called "VHT Nightshades" The result is a nearly opaque outer appearance, but only a tinting similar to dark sunglasses from the inside. This visor, like the rest of the helmet in this post, is a test piece. You'll notice some webbing in the PET plastic in the images. No sense testing the tint on a shiny, perfect piece! The back wire "hair" is a test piece for now, built with pieces I have laying about from other various projects. The actual plastic dome is built from the excess resin used trimmed out of the visor area. Currently the colors are incorrect, but this is just a "proof of theory" piece. New Chrome! The gold plating done in these shots was completed by " E7 Technologies " and is a process called Cosmichrome. While we're still getting some small issues worked out, this is a very cool technique. The people at E7 are everything that M&amp;M are not. They have helped me and been very accommodating through the entire process, and have been willing to run test pieces for me in order to achieve the best result. The images below are a shot of the "dud" helmet, which had too much orangepeel and issues with the finish to be called a success. Neat video of the chroming process: Part three should be the final chapter in this build, with everything coming together. Look for it around Halloween! Still to come.... EDIT: I'm currently working on a bit of a redesign here. Apologies of the site looks like crap for a little while. A commission came to me very, very last minute for a good friend of mine. He was planning on doing a Vault Dweller costume from Fallout 3, and needed a weapon in a month. Unfortunately I had other commissions, deadlines, and large projects to finish in that span of time. I looked at my schedule, decided I could shave off some sleep, and promised him 30 hours of build time. What follows is the result of that hurried errand. First, as always, I put together some blueprints. These are fairly low-detail, but work well for the scope of what I'm doing with this build. After this build was about 80% finished, I was pointed in the direction of currently-existing and much better and more accurate blueprints, but thats a story for when I take on this project again in the future and give it the proper time it deserves. In order to save time, my friend came over and traced my blueprints onto MDF. I taught him how to use a bandsaw (nothing like a crash course in something that can leave you fingerless!) and he went to town rough-cutting the shapes I'd refine later into the gun. Here's where we started: Impressive, right? I had a sick idea of just scotch-taping all these together, painting the whole thing silver, and handing it to him the day of the convention... but I'm not that mean. Ignore the lighter pieces near the bottom - those are part of another build. After cleaning up the cuts on a belt sander, I began the assembly of the main body in the 2 most prominent parts - the square "barrel" and the rear stock. These are both made from 1/2" MDF. The barrel has a few sections cut out for the microfusion cell... ...and a space for the rear stock and lower receiver to mount I used a table router to re-shape the holes in the stock and bevel the edges. This was also a low-budget build, so I didn't have the liberty of going out and buying fancy new holesaws. The lower support rod was made out of varying sized of pine dowel, threaded over a 1/4" aluminum bar. The front grip was made from 2 pieces of 3/4" MDF, screwed together and shaped on a belt sander. Styrene will eventually make up the grip texture. The microfusion cell was pieced together from some pre-existing elements. I had a small dome mold that I'm using on another project that happened to be pretty close. I pulled two of these and epoxied them around some 2" PVC pipe. MDF discs were affixed to the main body to make the housing around the cell. At this point, it started to resemble the final product! This is about 6 hours into the build ( Yes, I'm using "build" as a noun! Colloquial English; take that grammar sticklers! ) Styrene was added to the lower grip, as well as the cell eject lever and front barrel area for the raised textures The upper barrel pipe was made out of 3/8" steel pipe. This terminates into a lathed pine dowel glued to the barrel corner If you're wondering why some of these shots are so dark, recall that the "extra time" I found to build this came when I should have been sleeping. The bulk of this project was done between 10pm and 1am on most days... After a coat of primer and some sanding, I started scribing panel lines with a dremel tool, and adding screw recesses around the front of the barrel. Other details were added in MDF around the cell loading chamber, and the rear part of this area was faired down into the barrel of the gun with apoxie sculpt. I also added the raised pucks on the grip and stock. Recessed areas were drilled into the gun and filled with countersunk phillips screws More styrene and MDF pieces were added to the barrel and rear area of the gun to build up the details in these areas. The shapes of these were largely improvised, as by this point I only had 4 days left until my deadline with many other projects that needed completing. After this, the whole gun received a coat of gray primer to seal the remaining exposed wood. The first coat of paint went on shortly after the above finished drying. I used Krylon hammered silver, followed by a coat of Testor's Olive Drab on the main barrel. Fortunately for me, these guns are supposed to be 200+ years old in the Fallout 3 universe. That means its time for my favorite thing of all... heavy weathering! The basecoat of weathering was done with acrylic paints and matte gel medium. I did an initial coat of black, followed by browns and greens to simulate dirt and corrosion. After this dried, I gave the whole piece drybrush silver accents to simulate wear and tear from the wastelands. chipping away at the paint and caked-on dirt. The finished piece has a nice shimmer to the metallic silver drybrush, which simulates metal rather well. Finally, some more shots of the finished product from a few different angles. I'm still looking for a good way to transfer my vector decals to the gun. I tried water-slide as with my Portal gun build, but yellow ink on top of dark green showed up very poorly. There are a lot of details missing from the final product, so I want to return to this prop someday and build it without such an insane time restriction! I really wish I could have given this project a bit more time and been more dedicated to the intricate detail this gun has, but for a 4 day build this turned out better than I could have hoped. Happy Super Mutant Hunting! Wait. ...you know... I had this whole thing written out, and then I went to preview the blog entry, and something just didn't look right. The rifle was weathered, but it still looked too clean on that white background. The graphics of the Fallout games do a good job of making the weapons look blackened, but I felt like this needed a bit more. I went back after thinking about it, and decided to add some rust to the AER9. The shots above is how the gun was delivered and shown at the convention. Here's how it sits now: And, just for the hell of it, a modified version of one shot in the "Fallout 3" graphic style: (Higher res pic HERE , and more high-res shots of the build process available on my flickr page ) Ok, NOW we're done! I finally lost my mind enough to try to tackle one of these big guys. For those unfamiliar, Big Daddys are the protectors of the Little Sisters in Rapture, an underwater city devoid of morality which has degenerated into chaos and insanity. They are huge, fast, strong, and as it turns out, a solid pain in the ass to build. I'm going to break with tradition for a sec, and show you the finished product first. This is a long, long, long post that details nearly 7 solid weeks of work, and you guys deserve to know that the long post is quite necessary, and (I think) well worth the read. Credit goes to " scenemissingmagazine " on Flickr for this amazing photograph: (High-rez shot here) So, here's how I did it. First thing's first, I needed blueprints. I built these in Illustrator, based off some very good reference images that the guys at 2K published in their artbooks: Since this is such a large project, I'll break down the build process into partitions: The main body, the dome, the drill arm, the dome cage, other details, and the final paintwork. The Main Body Starting with the blueprints printed at full scale (HUGE) I made cross sections out of insulation foam and glued them into place. The empty areas between sections were filled with cardboard. This formed what I called the "skeleton" of the body. The empty cavities in the skeleton were then filled in with expanding foam After drying, the foam was carved into the shape of the main body After this was completed (and the foam given more drying time so it would retain its shape) the entire form was covered in stretch fabric. This smoothed out a lot of the lumpiness of the foam Accent areas around the arms, legs, and top of the body were made out of insulation foam, then glued to the body. Before coating with paint or fiberglass resin, these were covered with Ureshell to prevent the poly foam from dissolving. Certain areas on the body itself were also given a coat of Ureshell so they would not disintegrate. After this was dry, the entire body piece was given several applications of fiberglass resin. The front flap was added using more insulation foam, and also given a coat of Ureshell and resin. After this was dry, I began hollowing out the foam and cardboard. After adding some details on the body with foam tape, more ureshell, and more resin, I had a finished form! The Dome I started with a 24" smoked security camera dome off of eBay. This came from a demolished shopping center, and are actually hard to track down these days, given the much smaller size of most security cameras. I remember these all over the place as a kid. I was sent two of them for some reason, so if anyone wants the second one, just let me know. After trimming the square edge off, I cut a disc from insulation foam to serve as the "ring" around the dome. I made resin copies of wingnuts which were glued into place on the trim ring. About 15 of these resin duplicates weighed as much as a single wingnut. Since I had to wear this thing, every ounce saved counted! For the portholes, I made a single master out of PVC and MDF wood... ...which I molded in silicone. The portholes were all slush-cast to save weight and time in production. Also, this way, they're completely identical. The tape here is marking the spacing of the portholes After coating the dome in resin to thicken it a bit, I trimmed the porthole-holes with a dremel. The dome was a very brittle acrylic, so this was a nerve-wracking process! The drill arm Unfortunately, since this project was done in such a hurry, my process photography was somewhat lacking. The drill started out as an aluminum rod with 4 triangles of matteboard affixed to it. Rings of foam were made around the matteboard, then paper layered on top of that to create the cone shape. The actual "blade" of the drill bit is made from masking tape which has been layered in small sections to follow the curve of the drill sides. This piece was coated in several layers of fiberglass resin (some with tinting to check coverage) To create a really worn look, I added bits of debris to the fiberglass resin. This made a convincing textured metal finish in the end, as these parts were painted to look like rust, dents, and bits of splicer. A PVC cage and old DeWalt 12V cordless drill make up the support frame and motor for the drill. I moved the battery inside the body of the suit to save on weight hanging from my arms. The "housing" for this mechanism was made from a concrete tube, electrical conduit PVC and more foam tape. This was painted in ureshell to protect it during painting as well as to give it texture. The Dome Cage This was constructed mainly out of PVC electrical conduit. This pipe is gray in color and takes heat and bending much better than standard white PVC tubing. I bought 40 feet of it for this project and ended up using about 35. At only ¢88/10 feet though, this was an easy buy. The sides terminate into 3" PVC couplers. These slide over 3" PVC pipe anchored to the body that has been notched to be a sightly smaller diameter than 3". Since the wearer has to enter through the front porthole, the dome as well as the cage must be removable. The front of the cage is friction-fit at the top and bottom anchorpoints, as well as the sides, so it can easily be put on and taken off. A quick test of the body, dome, and cage. This is after the dome has had all portholes carved out and secured. Other Details An animatronic hand and arm extension were created for the left side of the suit. This would help prevent the "stubby arm" look I've seen on other Big Daddy suit builds The rear tank was made from a 12" concrete tube with foam plugs on the top and bottom carved to a dome shape. The bands around the tank were made with foam tape coated in Ureshell. I made a pushmold of some bolt heads for texture, these were cast in resin and added to the tank as well as the banding on the main body. Boltheads and a first coat of paint on the tank. The wheel at the top is a cake decoration from our local supermarket. The boots were made from more insulation foam. These give me about 6" of lift and make the feet look proportional to the rest of Big Daddy. I got this i
On pages 8-9 of Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars I discuss the aftermath of the shutdown of Napster in 2001. This period is interesting because it presented the music industry with something of a crossroads: Napster had demonstrated there was a huge potential market for digital distribution of singles. I use the word potential because the trick was converting the free Napster model into a paying one. I use crossroads because there were two fundamental choices: either (1) ignore this potential market in the hope that if it was shut off (by having enjoined illegal services and by not offering legal alternatives) the industry could go back to things the way they were, that is, selling CDs ; or, (2) realizing that the market for digital singles was the future and had to be served. This latter choice, by the way, did not mean ending the immediate sale of CDs , but it did mean that the industry would have itself have participated in the offering of a product (singles) that made CDs less attractive. For an industry that is so big on control, one would have thought that the rational choice was to at least participate in the new market at its inception and thereby have some measure of control over the phasing out of one product as the next takes over. As I noted on page 5 of Moral Panics, Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel and creator of the Barbie doll observed, "Anyone can manage the upside cycle ... The secret is managing a product down its life cycle properly." And all products have life cycles; suing tens of thousands of your customers may fend off the inevitable decline for a short period of time, but the cycle will win because one thing copyright infringement actions can never do is make people buy a product they do not want. The record industry's failure to adapt to the next product, digital singles, was suicidal. There is controversy over how the decision not to jump into the digital singles market took place, that is, whether there were collusive efforts to impede the new market. I have no special knowledge on this and therefore have to rely on published sources, whose accuracy is also in question, but by not taking the rational option -- serving the new market -- the industry left the market to be served illegally (and I use "illegally" deliberately, in place of the less judgmental word "unauthorized"). The industry didn't sit back entirely though, two online services were eventually created, MusicNet and PressPlay . These services were doomed to fail, though, because they each only offered music from their respective label partners, because the pricing was high, DRM laden, etc. As I note on pages 9-10 of Moral Panics, the Department of Justice began investigating allegations that the major labels had designed MusicNet and PressPlay to impede the growth of authorized distribution of music on the Internet, through refusing to issue licenses and by refusing to offer genuinely attractive services of their own. The D of J closed the investigation without taking action. In a spin off of the original Napster case, the VC firm Hummer Winblad (a defendant at that point) detailed allegations that the labels had withheld critical information from the D of J. Judge Patel required the labels to turn over to Hummer Winblad documents which HW alleged the labels had withheld from the D of J. After this order was issued, the case against HW was settled, so we never had the chance to see if the conspiracy theory was of the space alien variety or not. (See pages 9-10 of Moral Panics). We may get a second shot though. Yesterday , the Second Circuit issued an opinion in a separate antitrust case over price fixing by MusicNet and PressPlay . The court of appeals reversed dismissal of the case by the trial judge. The court of appeals ruling lets the case, and therefore discovery, go forward. Much in the opinion concerns the general pleading standard in the wake of the Supreme Court's opinion in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and in letting the case go forward, the court of appeals did not pass on the merits of the allegations, instead holding that the allegations met the Twombly standard to survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. The allegations do provide some information on the post-Napster period, though. The court of appeals notes that in the post-Napster period, in order to obtain music from all the labels would have required consumers to subscribe to both services, at a cost then of $240 a year. What did one get for the $240? Each year, consumers were required to pay up again or else all the music they had purchased would have been blocked; songs couldn't be transferred to other devices, like iPods , and the DRM (which the court describes as unpopular) prohibited consumers from copying more than two songs from any artist. The court quoted an industry commentator who accurately concluded at the time that "nobody in their right mind will want to use" the two services. (Slip opn . page 4). The court also focused on the pricing of the services, noting that while many of the hard costs associated with CDs were dramatically reduced with CDs , "these dramatic cost reductions were not accompanied by dramatic price reductions for Internet Music, as would be expected in a competitive market." (Slip opn . page 4). To the contrary, the complaint alleges that there were parallel prices increases, enforced through MFN clauses that were contained in secret side agreements. (Slip opn . at 12). The case is one to follow, hopefully for the light it will shed into actual, behind the scenes practices during a critical period. Postscript: Ann Garrett has written me to correct a number of mistakes in the post regarding MusicNet. Here, with permission, are her comments. (Thanks Ann): Mr. Patry, in your blog “Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars” related to the entry on Jan. 14 ~ “MusicNet, Pressplay and Lost Opportunities” your premise: “… two online services were eventually created, MusicNet and PressPlay. These services were doomed to fail…” . As for MusicNet there never was a service. MusicNet (dba MediaNet) was and still is a platform that aggregates and distributes premium digital content to companies creating music-centric apps and services, online retail destinations or adding music content to web sites. The notion that the record companies agreed to launch two competing services that excluded content, fixed prices and ultimately failed, makes a compelling narrative. You’ll recall that this storyline was first written about eight years ago and since then has been repeated over and over again until it has become urban legend. But it has little to do with the actual history of MusicNet. Without going into too much detail on that history, here are some key points: · MusicNet was incubated at Real Networks which was its largest shareholder. Two labels subsequently came in as investors – WMG and EMI. Bertelsmann made an investment as well but this ended up hurting our relationship with the record company, BMG, which had minimal contact and didn’t seem to get along with the Bertelsmann guys. A New York-based private equity company bought out all the original investors and became the sole shareholder of MusicNet (today known as MediaNet). · Negotiating licenses with all the majors, indies and aggregators was a difficult and time-consuming process then and it still is today. As a rule of thumb we expect it to take about a year to add each new set of rights - subscriptions, download sales, on-demand streams, etc. The available content expanded from about 100,000 tracks nine years ago to ten million plus today but there were key hurdles along the way: o Record companies had an extremely difficult time initially clearing digital rights with their artists. No sooner did we add Dave Mathews than his lawyer demanded we take it down until his label, RCA records, negotiated an additional advance for exploitation of digital rights. High profile artists like Metallica had full control of their distribution and wouldn’t agree to make their catalogs available. Some artists agreed to offer their repertoire for download sales but not subscriptions and vice versa. Many tracks were in dispute because the artist had changed labels and the labels were subsequently consolidated under new companies, or the content was part of a compilation, or in the case of urban music, samples from other artists were used extensively. Through a long, deliberate process we have whittled down the high profile hold-outs to the Beatles , AC/DC and a handful of others. o Publishing clearances were a nightmare. It was only last year that the CRB came up with a statutory rate and licensing and payment standards. o Recorded music was mostly limited to a million or so major label and key indie tracks compared to the many millions available today. This has been due to incredible growth among Indie labels and music aggregators. · The rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated. MusicNet continues to be the most important digital service provider in the industry. Over the years we have powered every major brand from Yahoo and Microsoft in the US , to Tesco and HMV in the UK , and Samsung in Germany &amp; France . Our last quarter was our best ever and with the launch of our new product line, MN Open, we expect good results in 2010. · MusicNet has never built or marketed a service directly to consumers. Retail pricing has always been set by our customers. We pass through content costs and charge a transactional fee for our services. Should you need more details behind the growth and success of MusicNet (dba MediaNet), I am happy to connect you with our longtime CEO Alan McGlade. I am hopeful you can clarify MusicNet’s position in your blog entry. Best regards, Ann Garrett MediaNet There was a time when Netflix had a great business model: instead of having to get in your car, schlep to the nearest video rental store, pay late fees, and compete with others for the latest blockbuster movie (because, as the name Blockbuster Video implied, there wasn't a lot of anything else), you could, from the comfort of your home order movies to be mailed to your house. For a monthly subscription fee, you could keep them without paying late fees (this helped Netflix too, by cutting down on its postage costs), and the selection was also long-tail. As a result, I rented watched many, many more movies than I would have. However, in the wake of its deal with Warner, in which Netflix agreed to a 28 day embargo on renting the latest movies, in exchange for reduced DVD purchase costs, I have cancelled my subscription. Netflix's new business model is, apparently, the old business model of businesses first, consumers last. I expect the new business model will also be bad for Netflix and the studios. Instead of watching movies, I will do something else. Nor does the business model make sense now: it assumes that consumers want something -- to rent -- but that the studios, by depriving consumers of what they want, will be able to force them to do something they don't want to do: buy. I doubt it. I rented movies to watch them once. If I couldn't rent them, I didn't buy them. Why not? Because movies are just not important in the larger scheme of life or even the smaller scheme of consumer behavior: movies are merely entertainment, and usually trivial entertainment that doesn't warrant going out of your way to accommodate a scheme set up to frustrate your desires. If I couldn't rent a movie I did something else, and usually did that something else first anyway. Picking up a book, practicing clarinet, reading the New Yorker, are all perfectly fine, and usually better, alternatives. And if I did want to buy a movie, I would do it regardless of whether I could rent it, so the idea that the studios and Netflix can get consumers to buy when they only want to rent, doesn't make sense to me. What does make sense to me is to not give money to those who don't care about offering me what I want, and that's what I have done by cancelling my Netflix subscription; not out of spite or anger (its too trivial to get upset about anyway), but because its the wrong business model. When I was in Geneva two weeks ago, I gave a 16 minute video interview to Intellectual Property Watch, a Geneva-based publication. Here is the link. Other than the very beginning, where it looks like I am posing for a death mask, the interview is, I think, a good summary of what I was trying to accomplish in writing the book, and it contains analysis of how one metaphor ("a rising tide lifts all boats") works. When I worked for the U.S. House of Representatives, one of my favorite Congressmen was Dan Glickman , of Kansas. (Another was Howard Berman ). Mr. Glickman , along with 34 other Democrats, was defeated in the Republican 1994 electoral rout, and the following year he became President Clinton's Secretary of Agriculture, where he served with great distinction. In 2004, he succeeded Jack Valenti as head of the Motion Picture Association of America -- a hard act for anyone to follow. He recently announced he would retire at the end of his contract next year. Mr. Glickman has always been a sensible person, not given to extreme statements, and more interested in working through problems than in creating them. High-flying rhetoric is out of character. For this reason, I was surprised by a story in Wired back in late November about a letter he sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on ACTA . It didn't surprise me that MPAA strongly supports ACTA , but what did surprise me was the letter's effort to create a moral panic about those who oppose ACTA . In the letter, he says : Opponents of ACTA are either indifferent to [worldwide piracy] or actively hostile toward efforts to improve copyright enforcement worldwide. Many of them decried the WTO TRIPS agreement when it came into force in the 1990's and they now insist that any effort to build upon the TRIPS minimum standards for enforcement is "anti-consumer" and "anti-innovation." None of those statements are true, and there is an unfortunate, careless eliding of a number of points to misstate positions. The parts of ACTA that are controversial are not the parts that deal with customs and counterfeiting enforcement. Aside from some early wild conjectures about the scope of ACTA's customs proposals caused by the secrecy of the text, no one, as far as I know, has been critical of the very provisions that concern actual enforcement of rights against counterfeiters: MPAA is right to want to stamp out such conduct, and if improvements in global standards are required , we should improve them.There is no indifference or hostility on this issue. The next part of the statement about opposition to TRIPS is also false. I worked on the TRIPS implementing legislation on the House. Mr. Glickman did not, presumably, he was rightly focused on the agricultural provisions. I am not aware of anyone (much less "many") who at the time decried the TRIPS provisions on enforcement. No one called them anti-consumer or anti-innovation, or was hostile or indifferent to counterfeiting. Let's debate the merits of proposals, and skip the false rhetoric. Today, at the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights in Geneva, various statements were introduced by governments on a proposed treaty for the visually impaired. In the interest of full disclosure, my employer recently submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office a statement in support of the treaty (See here ). A number of developing countries' positions were disappointing in their lack of meaningful support of the proposed treaty. Certainly if those making statements in actual opposition had available to them the minuscule amount the visually impaired have, their views would be quite different. Theirs is a failure both of compassion and a failure to recognize the positive role of copyright in furthering access. Some apparently are willing to sacrifice the neediest in order to hold on to more than they already deserve. It is easy to find reasons not to do something; the mark of a generous and compassionate soul is finding reasons to do something. In this context, I applaud and we all should applaud the statement submitted by United States (available here ). The statement is the most genuinely balanced a
d forward-looking U.S. government document on copyright I have read since the days of the great Registers of Copyrights, Abraham Kaminstein and Barbara Ringer. Kudos to Justin Hughes, head of the U.S. delegation. I quote only the final paragraph, but one should read it all: We recognize that some in the international copyright community believe that any international consensus on substantive limitations and exceptions to copyright law would weaken international copyright law. The United States does not share that point of view. The United States is committed to both better exceptions in copyright law and better enforcement of copyright law. Indeed, as we work with countries to establish consensus on proper, basic exceptions within copyright law, we will ask countries to work with us to improve the enforcement of copyright. This is part and parcel of a balanced international system of intellectual property. In my last posting  I discussed reviews of the Moral Panics book, and my disappointment with a too-common failure to do much more than a USA Today- type superficial nuggets approach. I thought it might help to give an example. I have chosen the most recent review, by Nate Anderson at Ars Technica since neither Nate nor Ars Technica can be considered to opposed to the book’s project, and since I am a big fan of the blog, which has consistently done excellent work.   My purpose therefore is not to criticize Nate or Ars Technica but rather to show how even friendly venues can fall short. Nate’s review diminishes the book to a series of juicy metaphors which he   quotes in bullet points; having done so, he then characterizes the book as a screed. I am described as someone who when, “once freed from the shackles of legal writing, … can lob hand grenades with the best of them.” The reference to bomb throwing of course is itself perfect figurative language for talking about a book about Copyright Wars, an irony perhaps Nate appreciates, or not.   I chose the word “irony” here purposefully because after reducing the book to a series of metaphors, Nate comments: Not that there's anything wrong with a good screed; in the right hands, the screed can be a hugely enjoyable form. But there's a certain irony about the method here. The quotes above rely on the most vivid of metaphor … in order to discredit what they describe, yet this is exactly what Patry spends much of the book accusing Big Content of doing. So the book is a series of bomb-throwing, and even worse it’s a book about how bad bomb-throwing is. I must indeed be a hypocrite. There is apparently nothing more to the book, so it can easily be dismissed as a screed, good or not, that falls prey to the very disease it is trying to extirpate. Another failed, lousy book, next story.    Since the book is 200 pages of text (not counting footnotes), there must be an awful lot of   bomb-throwing, indeed this appears to be all Nate read since he states, “the tone here gets so one-sided at points that all but the most hardened copyfighter will probably set the book down at some passages, scratch the chin, and ask, "’Really?’" No examples of this are given, but we get the point from the bullet-point list of choice metaphors: the book is page after relentless page of metaphoric attacks on copyright owners.   No doubt this makes for an easy review, but it is a false characterization of the book. So let’s discuss what is actually in the book.

This is as far as most reviewers go, and they don’t even go very far into the first chapter. In identifying what the problems are, the purpose is not as Nate’s review suggests and too many others believe, to attack copyright. Instead, the why of the Copyright Wars is described as being economic. On page 36, I state: The economic conflict at the heart of the Copyright Wars lies in what economist Joseph Schumpeter termed “creative destruction”: the introduction of innovative products and business models that displace old ones. Far from being a threat to capitalism, Schumpeter’s great insight was that creative destruction “incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creative a new one. This process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.” “Capitalism is, Schumpeter described, “by nature a . . . method of economic change and not only never is but can never be stationary.” “Stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.” As an inherent fact, “every company [must] prepare the way for its own disruption.” Innovation—the root cause of creative destruction—is thus the way capitalism survives its own inherent tendency toward monopolization and stagnation, even as innovation is regarded as an existential threat to those who benefit from the status quo. In Schumpeter’s words, “a new firm’s intrusion into an existing industry always entails ‘warring’ with an ‘old sphere,’ which tries to prohibit, discredit, or otherwise restrict every advantage afforded to the new form by its innovation. Given the inevitability of such counter-innovative instincts by existing business, in order to ensure the continued vitality of innovation and capitalism itself, we must encourage innovation rather than try to kill it off as the copyright industries do. I follow this up in chapter 9 with a much more detailed discussion of Schumpeter and the economics of the Copyright Wars. On page 102, I place copyright owners within this context, stating: This is not to suggest that the copyright industries are venal; quite the contrary, it is to argue that they are all too normal. Distorted incentives lead to distorted conduct; because our current copyright laws provide rights and remedies that are far beyond what is necessary for copyright owners to recoup their investments and make respectable profits, and instead give copyright owners powerful weapons to quash competition and control consumers, we should not be surprised that the copyright industries utilize those weapons (and then some). In this respect, the copyright industries are no different than Wall Street or any other company placed in a similar situation.  In Nate’s review, there is not a single mention of book’s economic analysis even though it is the heart of the book. There is not a single mention of the book’s extensive examination of the economic evidence presented by copyright owners, and this is indeed ironic given that I quote from Ars Technica’s own leading work on this. See pages 31-36 of the book.   Nor is there any discussion of the book’s emphasis on the different nature of marketing in the content industries and in other, consumer-first industries. I discuss the work of Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt. I say on page 23 (is it too much to read 23 pages???): “Although usually written about as battles over technology or principles, the Copyright Wars are instead centrally rooted, what Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt called ‘marketing myopia.’” I then discuss these theories, including Levitt’s own take on Hollywood. But rather than simply say that some content owners are bad, bad, bad, I try to understand the source of the problem. Here is what I say on page 26: The myopia stems from corporate copyright owners’ adoption of control as their principal business model—closed systems, in which copyright owners tightly control everything connected to their works: which play back devices will be offered to the public; what types of access controls will be interposed before consumers can ever see, hear, or in the case of books or other literary works, even read a snippet of the work; the time period during which consumers will have access to the work; how many times can consumers see, hear, or read the work; in what format will consumers be able to access the work; what will they be able to do with the work once they finally access it: Can they copy reasonable portions for criticism and comment, can they make personal use copies or copies for use on other devices, can they use parts of the work to make other new works, including mash-ups? I then tie this in turn into the mantra that content is king, and instead assert that the consumer is king simply because copyright cannot be used to get a single consumer to buy anything. It is only consumer demand for products or services that gets copyright owners money. I have said over and over again that I want copyright owners to succeed, and that we all should want copyright owners to succeed, but by satisfying consumer demand, not by thwarting it. Nate’s review has no discussion of this part of the book at all, even though it is a central thesis of the book. Instead, we have below-the-belt shots like the end of the review: The views may not be Google's, but it's not hard to see why Patry has landed at an aggregator and indexer of content rather than a creator of it. Which, in a way, is too bad—making him the top lawyer at the MPAA or RIAA would be fascinating to watch, though we're doubtful that those atop the big content industries share his easy confidence that innovation quickly produces greater profits, or that ‘less copyright law" can be "better copyright law." Nate is referring to the disclaimer in the book, which states the book represents my views, not Google’s. The above quote from his review is designed to both acknowledge that disclaimer and deny it in the same breath. There is nothing in the book that advocates for less copyright law, a sentiment I in fact criticize. Instead I argue for effective copyright laws. (Pages 37-38).   We all benefit from effective copyright laws and we all suffer from ineffective laws. What I dispute is that copyright is a zero sum game, but that argument, like advocating effective copyright laws, doesn’t make good press. Here is what I actually say: For policy makers and the public, copyright is not a winner-takes-all proposition. Copyright is a system to advance public interests; those interests can be furthered by a copyright regime tailored to provide sufficient incentives to create new works.  (Page 37). That’s a far cry from simply shilling for aggregators (a term I reject anyway) or calling for less copyright law. Nor is there any discussion in the review of chapters 5 and 6 of the book, which discuss the implications of   the debate about copyright as property, and in which I instead take the view that copyright is a set of social relationships. The purpose of viewing copyright that way is again not to take sides, but rather to call for debating the issues on the merits. Hence on page 109, I say: “The advantage in regarding copyright as a system of social relationships is that it focuses attention where it belongs: in mediating conflicts within that system … .”   Such an approach does not favor aggregators or content owners, but rather asks that we consider the effects of legislation on society as a whole, a whole that includes everyone as a “stakeholder,” to use a current buzzword. Does that view stem from being employed by Google, does it favor Google? Obviously not, but one would never know that is my view from the review. Finally, what about the book’s own use of metaphors? Is it indicative that I unwittingly fell prey to the very tactic I supposedly condemn?   I don’t know how to respond to such a ridiculous question. It assumes that in writing a book that focuses on language I was unaware of the very language I was using and how it would be perceived by others, and that reviewers -- who have neither done their own research nor written their own books – somehow managed to burrow into the book and come up with a gotcha: in your dreams.   Here is what I say about this exact point (having anticipated it in the book itself, mind you): The danger of conceptual metaphors in law is easy to identify. Inferences inherent in the source domain (say, sharks) are automatically mapped onto the target domain (say, lawyers) where they become an inherent part of how we reason about the target domain (lawyers are sharks). This process is not one of comparison, where we merely note similarities and differences between two preexisting categories (like chicken and pheasant); instead, the mapping of inferences from the source to the target domain creates meaning in the target domain that did not exist before. Such mapping, however, may not always be apt; it may in fact be horribly wrong. Lord Palmerston once quipped: “Half the wrong assumptions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors, and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity.” In la
Happy SXSW week to you and yours. Once again I will not be attending, although I recently wondered if I could have gotten a record label or PR firm to cover my airfare and bar tabs while I whore myself for whatever bands they have in attendance. On the other hand, I harbor a dislike for much “indie” music and can see where it may have ended up as a “Fear & Loathing on 6th Street” type of occasion. “We were somewhere over Louisiana when the drugs began to take hold...” Anyway, as you might guess, my inbox was full of notices about appearances at SXSW. Probably the majority of the bands in today’s post will be there, but I can’t be arsed to dig up schedules for you. If you like the band and you’re going to be in Austin this week, I’m sure you’ll figure it out. This is a pretty small inbox purge because a lot of the stuff I received was electronica or whiney, self-indulgent indie/emo stuff or some mash-up/remix of the two genres, and I’m really not in the mood to hear that. The top stuff today is easily The Choke and The Ex-Girlfriend’s Club. Both bands bring the garage rock sound that I so enjoy. Also, if you think back to my last mailbox post , you’ll recollect Pack A.D. Well, as the fates would have it, The Choke are on tour with Pack A.D. You’ll definitely want to check out that bill if they come to a town near you. The Koot Hoomi track comes from a Hall and Oates tribute album the group did. It’s called The Dark Side of Hall and Oates and is bizarre enough that it warranted inclusion here. As always, follow the links for more information.

Following a decade alongside Eddie Van Halen, anything less would have seemed as if Diamond Dave were just settling for what he could get. Instead, he dove into his solo career with a big splash, introducing to the world one of the few guitarists who could arguably out-Van Halen Eddie Van Halen. Steve Vai had, of course, been around for years before DLR brought him on board: He’d been working with Frank Zappa since 1979 and was often credited on Zappa’s albums as performing “stunt guitar” or “impossible guitar parts.” Vai left as Zappa’s fulltime guitar player in the early 80s, releasing a solo album and serving a short time as Yngwie Malmsteen’s replacement in Alcatrazz. Then, in 1985, he made the career move that would catapult him onto rock’s world stage. In an old interview with the DLR Army fansite , Vai reminisced about how he ended up joining forces with Diamond Dave. Billy Sheehan, who would play bass on Eat ‘em and Smile , recommended Vai to Dave. “I’ll never forget,” Vai said. “I was in the shower, covered in soap, and a call came in: ‘Hey, this is Dave Roth, man!’ I was like, ‘No, it's not!’ He said, ‘Yeah man, we’re putting a group together.’” Eat ‘em and Smile came out to mostly positive reviews. Critics agreed the album was fun in the style of the early Van Halen albums and was actually better than the slick pop rock coming from Dave’s old band mates. Some even called it the “real” follow-up to 1984 . Shy Boy.mp3 In this age of iPods and iTunes and random singles, it’s unusual to sit and listen to an entire album. This past week, though, I’ve been in the mood to put on an album (OK, a CD, whatever) and listen to the whole thing. Call it random song burnout, but I’ve gotten tired of hearing whatever comes up on “shuffle.” I want control over my musical destiny. One of the disks I listened to this weekend was AC/DC’s U.S. debut, High Voltage . I specify the U.S. debut, because that’s the one I have, and also because this version was actually a compilation of AC/DC’s first two Australian releases, High Voltage and T.N.T . Their Aussie debut release also had a much different track list than what the rest of the world would get. The album that hit these shores in May 1976 included only two tracks from the original Australian release, with the rest of its songs being pulled from T.N.T. The track I’m reaching out for today, “Little Lover,” is one of the two from the original release that made it onto the international version. Typical of many AC/DC songs from this era, it’s a sleazy, bluesy romp about a groupie (“When the band said goodnight, I had to say hello”). It’s also one of my favorites from this album and one you probably never hear anymore. Little Lover.mp3 ~~~~~ ( Can You Go a Little Deeper is an irregularly recurring feature here wherein I resurrect old favorites, lost songs, and other things you maybe haven’t heard in a while ) When I was back there in seminary school.... Oh wait, that’s a different story. How about “when I was back there in high school...” ... I saw Devo make their network television debut on Saturday Night Live. Although many of my tastes were very white bread and mainstream, I was also drawn toward music that was outside of that box. In the harsh world of high school, those tastes were seldom met with approval. Such was the case when, the Monday after their October 1978 appearance on SNL, I went to school raving about this band who had quirkily covered “Satisfaction” and had the gall to appear dressed in yellow jumpsuits like some freaks from another planet, while preaching de-evolution. And all this just a week after the Stones themselves had graced the stage at Studio 8H. SNL was still relatively new and hip then, so everyone watched it and everyone had seen Devo and everyone hated them. Those of you who are still just a few years removed from high school will remember how fear of the unknown and different is a potent virus that pervades every school, everywhere. So of course a couple of weeks later, when I showed up at school sporting a Devo t-shirt, it was greeted with hatred and derision by the cool kids rocking their Mahogany Rush tees. tl;dr? I’m posting Devo, not Mahogany Rush. This is a collection of live Devo, recorded at various venues and at various dates, from the 1978 SNL appearance through a 1988 performance of “Girl U Want.” Unfortunately, other than rough dates, I don’t have any additional information on where the songs come from.

Popa Chubby (more on the name in a bit) plays the kind of raunchy blues / rock-a-billy / old-school country that you want to hear in a bar, not sitting on the couch in your living room at 10 in the morning. Last year he released his 19th album, Vicious Country , a disk that not only showed off his talent on the guitar, but also paid tribute to the legendary music that has influenced him along the way. The album, while not attracting much mainstream attention, continued to build on the legend that is Chubby. Ted Horowitz came out of the Bronx, raised on Clapton, Hendrix, and the Stones. By the time he was in his early 20’s, he had found his love for the blues, but had also found his way into occasional work with Richard Hell. Ted’s first big break was winning a national blues talent search sponsored by KLON, a public radio station in Long Beach, Calif. I’ve found two versions as to how Ted Horowitz became Popa Chubby. The first comes from something Chubby himself said. He was jamming one night with Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic, he says, and, “He was singing a song called ‘Popa Chubby’ and he pointed at me.” “Popa Chubby basically means to get excited. The core of my music is about excitement. I think music should make people feel alive.” The other version – unsourced, I might add, but on the Popa Chubby Wiki page – claims the name is a variation of the term “pop a chubby.” My guess is that, as usual, the truth is somewhere between the two versions. Popa Chubby’s 20th album, The Fight Is On , is due out March 22. If you can’t find it your local big box retailer (haha!), you can order it from the Popa Chubby website . In the meantime, here are a couple of things from the Vicious Country LP. The woman on vocals is Galea, Chubby’s sometime bass player and longtime collaborator. Break Me Down.mp3 Satan is Real / Straight to Hell (Hank III cover).mp3 Harper Valley P.T.A. (Jeannie C. Riley cover).mp3 Right now seems as good a time as any to bring you up to speed on erstwhile Guns N’ Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Of course you know Izzy left the Gunners in late 1991 to pursue other interests. He released his debut solo album, Izzy Stradlin & the Ju Ju Hounds within a short time of leaving G n’ R, seemingly disappeared for six years, then released a second solo effort in 1998. The next year, Izzy released the Japan-only Ride On , followed in (relatively) quick succession by two more albums, both released on independent labels. Since then, Izzy has stuck to Internet-only releases, supported by a small but loyal fan base. His latest disk, Smoke , was released last November with no real media attention, but a lot of excitement from Izzy’s fans: Comments such as “Simply Izzy.... signature,” and “guaranteed Izzy, nothing more, nothing less,” were posted on the ChopAway Website following the album’s release. I haven’t listened to any new Izzy Stradlin music in probably 10 years. Once in a while I’ll pull out the Ju Ju Hounds disk, which I love, and give that a spin. And I’ve always appreciated Izzy’s serious Ron Wood influence. In fact, if memory serves, they actually did a song together many years ago. Smoke picks up where I left off with Izzy 10 years ago. He still plays bluesy rock ‘n’ roll and still flaunts his Stones influence. With no industry suits breathing down his neck, Izzy is free to make the music he and his fans enjoy. Sometimes it's refreshing to hear something that hasn't changed to suit the times. Comfort Zone.mp3 To my knowledge, Smoke is available only through iTunes, although some of his older albums are on Amazon. I figure the last day of the month is as good a time as any to dump out the mailbox. Start fresh next month and all that. A lot of stuff from bands that are going to be at SXSW next month. I’ll be not attending again this year, so who plays or doesn’t play isn’t going to much affect me. Just send me good music if you want me to post it. Kthx. I’m gonna jump right in with my pick of the litter. The Pack A.D., from the home of the 2010 Winter Olympics, are a duet – guitar and drums a la Jack and Meg – and take a similar, garage/blues approach to their music. Singer Becky Black has garnered more than a few comparisons to a certain legendary 60's whiskey-throated blues shouter. I really liked this band and look forward to hearing more of their music. A couple of other things that are interesting: Patrick Bower’s “The Dark Lord (of Love)” has a weird, dark sound to it and made me want to hear it more than once. Moneybrother’s “Born Under a Bad Sign” is another of those tracks I almost passed on, but, after a couple of listens, decided to include. It’s a sort of poppy, dancey, type of thing. Maybe like something from the first Killers album or something. Just know that it’s not a cover of the Albert King classic. The very last song on today’s list, “Sleepwalking,” I decided to include sight unseen. That is to say, I didn’t even care if the music was up to my usual rigorous standards. Everything Is Made In China, or EIMIC as their friends call them, come from Russia. When was the last time you heard a Russian pop band? Exactly. So they get a mention just for that.

So I think I’ve found the problem: They need to cut out the shit in the studio. I found a couple of disks of demos and damned if even the crap songs from the later albums sound decent when they’re unadorned by studio fluffery. Prime example: “Living on the Edge,” which was, in my opinion, a typical late model, Aerosmith pop song. The demo shows the song stripped down and raw, before Bruce Fairburn glossed it up and turned it into mainstream mediocrity. This collection, which was probably assembled by a fan, is titled Divers Aerosmith . I don’t know if that’s meant to be “Diver’s” or “Diverse.” Regardless, the original set had 32 songs, some of which had been released commercially, some of which had poor sound quality, and some of which just sucked (i.e. an orchestral version of “Crazy”). I trimmed the fat and ended up with 11 songs that I think are pretty quality. With the exception of “Mama Kin” and “Walk This Way,” everything comes from Permanent Vacation or newer. And, to the best of my knowledge, nothing here has been commercially released. Bottom line: Here’s yet another Aerosmith post. You know we're all still fans.

My new blog is active at http://ondrejka.net . If any of you are still reading, apologies for going dark. Too much work, too much travel. Sitting in the United Club at Heathrow with T-Mobile's WiFi barely working. Just finished a book worth reading, Fooled by Randomness . Jonathan Seelig , of Akamai and Globespan fame, recommended it. Enjoyable, topical, and provides a delightful framework for thinking about how to measure performance against underlying trends -- particularly when the underlying trends change dramatically. This is so evocative of Second Life. Nice coverage of its creation story by Hamlet . World Builder from Bruce Branit on Vimeo . Amazing what serious talent, tech, and $2000 can do... Via Google, estimates on total number of US homes current foreclosed or being foreclosed vary between 1M and 2M. Let us assume an upper bound of 2M homes. Median US home prices are freefall, currently around $175,000, down from a peak of over $300,000 in 2006. Of course, in foreclosed areas like Cleveland, the real value is basically $0. So, let's try to determine the sum total of wealth lost by these "toxic assets", assuming 50% of foreclosed home are worth effectively $0 and half are worth the current median. (1M homes) x ($300,000 lost) + (1M homes) x ($300,000 - $175,000 lost) = $425 billion So, $425 billion to keep 2 million families in their homes, make it easier for those families to hold on to jobs and to keep working, to prop up the all the credit default swaps, etc, that are collapsing because these mortgages aren't being repaid, and to ensure that banks don't collapse due to unpaid loans. Why are we pouring the money into the banks directly rather than protecting tax payers? Oh, because doing this would reward a bunch of predatory lenders? First, which is more important: keeping people in homes as we enter a second great depression or punish those who took advantage of lax regulations to cause it? Second, and more importantly, the act of repaying these loans would enable a process of identifying the top 20% of most egregious loans, allowing those who broke the law to be prosecuted. OK, I'm not an expert, but given the astronomical sums we're talking about, keeping a sizable percentage of the workforce in homes plus propping up the umpteen trillions of dollars leveraged against those mortgages, $425 billion is starting to look pretty reasonable. While not quite the technology convergence of a Roomba getting run over by a Segway , being able to read Kindle books on iPhone is pretty darn close. Amazon just released a new app for iPhone that let's you do just this and it is very slick. You connect it to your Kindle account and all your Amazon book purchases are available, with the last page you're on more-or-less properly synced up. Very cool. The reading experience is very good for such a small device, the interface is slick, and downloads quick on even a 1G iPhone. Downsides? Really the only big problem is that there doesn't appear to be a way to send mobipocket, pdf, or other text files to iPhone the way you can for Kindle. This is a real bummer, as currently 23 out of the 135 books on Kindle are Amazon e-books. The rest are mostly from the Baen library . I hope they decide to fix this, as it makes both devices more valuable to me. Still, combined with Amazon's new digital publishing platform , Amazon is working hard to create a strong ecosystem around e-books. Great opportunity for authors who can move early, I suspect. I've posted a fair amount -- and quite positively -- about my current Kindle, so it should come as no surprise that I was quick to order Kindle 2 . It arrived Wednesday and I broke it in with Daemon , Daniel Suarez's impressive debut novel (more on that in a moment). If you've seen a picture you know that the Kindle 2 is much thinner and sleeker than the original. This translates to a much more solid feel out of the box, although I've found it to be slightly less comfortable to hold, perhaps due to Kindle 1 muscle memory. To first order, it operates the same as Kindle 1. The boot time is much faster, the inward clicking buttons superior and less prone to accidental clicks, and the page flips enough quicker to be noticeable. The new screen's 16-gray levels make photos look surprisingly good, and being able to charge via USB helps me on the road. Finally, while I miss the sparkle, the multi-way stick does make highlighting a lot easier. Downsides? Moving content over from my first Kindle was a pain, mostly because Whispernet and/or Amazon were clearly slammed Wednesday night. The leather binder doesn't have the original's elastic to hold it closed. All-in-all, a great set of incremental improvements and an even better device for my needs. As for Daemon , I really enjoyed it. It has all of the trappings of a first book -- uneven pacing, limited character development, some typos -- but, wow ! I've never seen a book that mixes action; this level of understanding of the god complex all game developers have; the technology around robotics, virtual worlds, and the net; and, wraps it all up in book that is speculative while only leveraging real tech. Very cool and quite recommended. I've previously written about the password anti-pattern , so it is distressing to see it becoming the standard in virtual worlds as well. James just posted about what would otherwise be a w00t-worthy event from the bright folks at realXtend , direct teleportation between Second Life-compatible virtual wrolds ! Very cool stuff, except for: When you click the link, the viewer brings up a log-in window; enter in the avatar name and password associated with the other world you're going to, and the teleport process begins. [emphasis mine] Sigh. What makes this all the more distressing is that two years ago, Mark Lentczner, Ian Wilkes, and I designed the solution to this on a whiteboard. We had recognized that between OpenSim and whatever came next, that there would be a critical need to enable interoperation through communication/shared presence. It also provided a nice model for scalability, not to mention allowing for deeper interconnections between Second Life and the rest of the web. It has influenced internal design discussions, as well as the standards efforts, but hasn't moved fast enough to be available to projects like realXtend, which is too bad. I am a huge fan of Juan Enriquez , who I was fortunate enough to meet him while giving a Second Life talk to AMD a few years ago. His book " Untied States of America " is one of the most thought provoking books I've read and a huge influence on my " Collapsing Geography " article. Thus, it should come as no surprise that his TED talk is brilliant: It is really two talks in one. The first is a fairly succinct analysis of the current econopocolypse. The second, a believable, gentle transition from humanity as we see ourselves today to our inevitable bio-engineered, cyborg future. Inevitable because the techniques and technologies that create therapies to grant the disabled human-normal abilities won't stop at human-normal. Like all other technology processes, the overlapping s-curves of therapeutics are accelerating forward. As they claw forward along the flat, early part of the curve, progress is painfully slow, but wait a while. Like all exponentials, beware of forward predictions. The long term will be far more transformational than we expect.
We tested it properly and it required about 20 ml of alcohol to bring 0.5 litres of water to the boil (boiled for 60 seconds) in about 8 mins. I think it is actually a bit faster than the side vent but you do have to carry the extra 30 grams of pot stand. The extra advantage of this is that the stove fits in the pot stand and is protected when travelling. I expect this one to last a lot longer that the purely aluminium ones.

We have got more and more light and with this returning light we have had more and more blows. We sort of define a blow when the wind reached about 20 knots (we measure this about 10m above the surface), at this point working outside becomes nearly impossible. You can easily walk between buildings but actually working outside is not nice. At 30 knots you start to lose sight of the other buildings and for someone on crutches its not great. Above 40 knots its best not to linger too long outside. One thing that has happened is that this year's weather haven nearly blew away. The wind was above 40 knots and somehow it worked open a bit of the tent. The weather haven is a very very large tent that is used to store the blimp. The blimp is filled with helium and the Simpson people use it to measure low level ozone by attaching special instruments to the bottom. Anyway the wind was so high the weather haven nearly blew away. The blimp inside was damaged so much that after we had fixed everything we were able to crawl into it through the gapping holes in the side.

To most people, firefox is just some sleek anti-Microsoft, tab-multiplying, add-on rich internet browser. What they don't know is that fire fox is a nickname for the red panda, which we came across at the Wellington Zoo yesterday. --> Sure, it's endangered, and it leaves a musky scent all over its territory, but who doesn't these days? That's a good bear-cat. Good boy! We saw all sorts of others too. Kiwis, talking parrots, some lazy roos, an evil monkey tribe, zebras, lions licking each other's privates, tigers, sun bears, tarantulas, otters, the whole bit. Nice. ...and this is the first zoo to carry miniature giraffes! --> Well, things down under are winding down. Trainer worked his last night at Nicolinis as an Italian waiter on Friday, and had his last all-you-can-eat pizza Monday at Hell Pizza. If things go to plan, he'll have his last Tuesday at Mermaids, and then that'll be that. Heading for home - the Bay Area and back down. Dunne leaves for a South Island tour on Tuesday as well, and then he's off to school in the states too. Calvert, as is often the case, remains the last man standing. He manages his own bar now, and will keep the flag flying in Wellington as a sort of living history of the NZBoys - bold, roguish, and serving alcohol to the younger crowd. It's been a sweet journey. We'll miss the clean skies, rockin' locals, and late nights. Sometimes it does pay to get out of the house, I guess. Yeah. Take a walk on the wild side. So long! [Screen fades to music: Nothin But Mammals by Bloodhound Gang] Rugby - a sport most Americans haven't even heard of - is the central most important thing to New Zealanders. And the All Blacks , the New Zealand national team that earned its name back in the 19th century, is the most important thing to New Zealand rugby fans. So, we thought: "We've been here six months. We've eaten kiwi burgers, drunk kiwi beer, kissed kiwi girls...we might as well watch some kiwi sports." And we bought stadium tickets - the cheap ones, of course. Sidenote: Rugby vs. American football...who's the boss? The debate can't be won. They're different sports, with different strategies. Rugby guys don't wear pads, but most kiwis feel that football players "hit harder." (They've been watching a lot of American football movies.) I'll tell you this. The average rugby player is a huge, huge dude. And he's fast, and he has to think on his feet, without someone planning everything for him, and he can take one hell of a hit......And almost every New Zealand guy is a New Zealand rugby player. You get the picture. We've seen it on TV, and we've gasped at how raw the sport is. We've heard the hype. We've watched the news. It was our turn to see it for ourselves. So we pre-gamed, dressed up, and joined the black tide of fans heading for the Wellington Westpac stadium. Oh, what a night. It started with the haka , an ancient Maori war challenge that's been a centerpiece of the All Blacks for time immemorial. It looks savage, and powerful, and spiritual. It means the players are out for blood. As is turns out, our seats were three rows back from the field. We could feel the players breathe. And because we cheered so hard, we even got on national television. Maggie saw a closeup of the three of us on the megatron, and the guys back in the penthouse caught the same shot of us yelling like idiots on tv. We looked kind of like this: Naturally... As promised, we've logged, mapped, and uploaded pictures for the South Island tour of New Zealand. Completed in about 3 weeks, the trip was a mix of close encounters with wildlife, non-stop vistas, sidetrips to off-the-path wonders, and the usual local flavors and parties. The Complete Travel Log says it all. Made with Google's new "My Maps" feature, the map allows you to click on interesting spots and pull up our stories and pictures from the area. It also shows our route through the whole thing, in case you'd like to find these beautiful spots yourself. We rode with Kiwi Experience the whole way, so this is also a good way to take a look inside what their South Island trips offer. If you'd like bigger pictures, and more of them, then check out the South Island web album . It's a great way to get an up-close look at what New Zealand's South Island has to offer. Later, we made our own way through New Zealand's North Island , and you can check out that travel/adventure map if you're into it. The North Island Web Album has all the pics. There a lots of stories to tell of these journeys, and the travel maps have all kinds of inside scoops for you there. So check them out if you're into...say... swimming with dolphins, jumping into waterfalls, petting giant boars, feeding carnivorous parrots, hiking glaciers and tunneling through blue ice, kayaking in baby-blue water with seals and golden beaches, hitting up the world-famous wineries, jet-boating, horse-back riding, sheep shearing, beach lounging, brewery touring, river swimming, bungy jumping, sky diving, white-water rafting, black-water rafting, glowworm watching, paint-balling, off roading, tim-tam slamming, watching sunsets on the beach, or just having a drink and a good time. Enjoy! Whereas once we stood united, gazing across the harbor bathed in gold by the autumn sun, the skies have now grown dark, as have our hearts. Today bright morning has given way to grey mourning... and we are forever changed. May you find that for which you seek, Shock. Farewell. Ewver one else have sequestered themselve in deep conversatons. So I put on a funny hat. Stack 'em up! hour 7....drunk, high, bi-curious.....the crew embarks on an endeavour into the unknown.....1 bottle of shtitty tequila, a box of wretched dry white wine, 2 bottles of Lindauer Special Resrerve, and 10+ cases of Tui later, the crew is in full swing.....mussels by the kilo, nachos as big as your head, and, well, popcorn. how else can you sum up my last weekend of piss.....brilliant! we've got scots, kiwis, americans, and one helluva good time rollin.....stay tuned for updates ........ The breaking of the Fellowship shall soon be upon us... We only know one way to celebrate... Target Practice. and Food and Beer Stay tuned as this thing could spiral out of control... You know what... I'll just let this picture speak for itself. Those of you who know me already understand. Today was a good day. Now, off to find the Crown Royal.

by FERENC IVANICS We usually walk on roads with high traffic. We've seen a lot of things, but we think there are two hot-shots of the roadside : bottles filled with piss , tossed by truck drivers; used diapers tossed by parents. We've gotten used to their sight, I try to understand the habit but I can't really. I know it's smelly but there's at least two garbage cans in ten minutes drive. This one on the photo puzzled us: why a six-pack? Were there six babies? All had crapped at the same time? Was this a long-time collection? Still a mystery... In case you haven't noticed, news on this blog are not exactly real-time. There are two separate reasons. The boys don't have internet-enabled mobile devices (or service providers), they cannot post directly but with a delay (from internet cafes), which is sometimes a few days and in troubled periods can grow up to two weeks. Even though the language skills of Ferenc and István have improved a lot, they post in Hungarian. One of us from the background team translates and edits all the posts. This adds another delay to the process, an additional two or three weeks. To get up-to-date news, subscribe to the twitter feed. by FERENC IVANICS Suddenly a red car stopped by our side, with a middle-aged couple inside. Soon we made clear that we weren't hitchhikers and didn't need a ride. Next day we found the place a German-Mexican guy had recommended us two months ago. He told us that the shore of the lagoon is clean ant the owner surely would let us stay for the night. So we had fought our way through the jungle, found the spot, a small bungalow and... a red car at the lake shore. Yep, the red car of that kind couple. The Bacalar Lagoon is and extremely pleasant place and its water is even cleaner. We took a refreshing swim in the blue freshwater lake and moved on the next day. by FERENC IVANICS On the eastern shore of the peninsula there's rocky coast as well. If you look closer, many of these rocks are dead corals. Sian Ka'an features the third longest coral reef of the world. Unfortunately we don't have the means to scuba-dive watching the colorful fishies underwater. On the other side of the peninsula there is a series of mixed-water lagoons. The water is crystal clear, so it's another preferred destination for scuba-divers . We managed to walk to Punta Allen in two days. Bu there came the twist: How to get across to Playón, which is nothing but a wooden stage, a small harbor for boats. To our surprise we found a volunteer almost immediately. After crossing the bay (one or two miles) he mentioned that he wouldn't reject a small payment. But we couldn't give him anything, we were broke. Literally. But he did take it well. From this point forward it was 40 miles of forest, totally uninhabited forest. Practically it was a 40 miles long tunnel. We lived on biscuits, milk powder and canned beans. We did have enough food for three days but definitely not enough water. On these parts of the reserve there's no coconut palms, so we could have gotten into trouble. There was almost no traffic on this road. On the second day we ran out of water , but then the skies opened up and small ponds began to form on the middle of the path. Thanks to our friend, Drew we had a water filter with us, so, we were saved. Trees, trees, trees. The longest walk we've had under trees. And these trees gave us some headache when we were looking for a camping spot. But since there was no traffic, we camped on the road. Not on the middle of it, but on the road. And on the third day we reached Felipe Carrillo Puerto. It was a great relief. Was it worth it? Sure!! Sian Ka'an, Part 1 by FERENC IVANICS From Tulum to Chetumal there's a paved road. But there's another path that takes you through the biosphere reserve Sian Ka'an . That is the major national park in the Caribbean, and it's been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987. Mostly made of huge palm forests, there's a peninsula with freshwater lagoons, a coral reef , etc. We knew many tourists visit this area from Tulum. And then come back to Tulum. We wanted to move on south after visiting Sian Ka'an . We didn't know if it was possible, so this choice was a bit risky, but we wanted to see what does the real, wild Caribbean looks like, without the signs of human civilization, huge hotels, crowded beaches, harbors. And Sian Ka'an is beautiful. There's a 35 miles long road from Tulum to Punta Allén, running on the peninsula between palm trees and mangroves , the sea is extreme blue, but there's too much litter running on shore... Our only trouble (besides the ever-present mosquitoes ) was drinking water. It wasn't serious though, I mean, we could have stopped a tourist convoy to ask for water anytime, but we turned to our most-honored coconuts. Wildlife is dense in Sian Ka'an, we've seen coatis , western red pandas , capybaras , small crabs living in shells, and there's pumas and jaguars as well in this jungle. But the most dangerous species we've met was that little crab with its heavy claws. Sian Ka'an, Part 2 by FERENC IVANICS Tulum is an authentic Caribbean holiday resort. It's expensive for us, but if you look at its beauties and compare the prices to other places, I'd say it's rather affordable , or even economical. There are a lot of young travelers, hippies, nature lovers here, they rent cheap bungalows or camp near the beach. We, by luck, ran into Chain and Jaime , they run a campsite near the Tulum beach. We can tell, that was the most exotic camping we'd ever seen . We passed two quite enjoyable days there (though you can't escape from the mosquitoes). This lovely couple told us we could stay for as long as we wanted, but we had things to get arranged in the town of Tulum. Thank you! by FERENC IVANICS Thanks to the helpful tourists in Playa del Carmen we bought a new pair of tents . Our fourth pair on our 8000 miles walk. We bought two Jeep Hiker Tents , these are pretty strange tents but they seem strong enough, ant that's what's important for us. They chipped in enough to buy some new socks and pants as well. Due to the almost expired visas our days were counted in Mexico . We were expecting to receive new shoes from the U.S. so we arrived in Tulum full of hope. Thank you for your support. by FERENC IVANICS We stopped at Playa del Carmen, some 40 miles south of Cancún. Found a deserted go-kart track and made a base camp there. Our tents are full of holes , our clothes aren't any better. Playa del Carmen is full of tourists, Canadians, Europeans, from the U.S.A... The city is full of bars, shops, restaurants, it's a pleasure factory. We just sit on the 5th avenue with a WorldWalk-board. Two bearded guys in identical clothes, looks interesting. Many passer-byes are curious about us and we always chat with them, usually mentioning the situation with our tents and clothes. We get some small donations and even some major help, like the support from the Hungarian Tukarcsy family. (We met other Hungarians as well: many thanks, Marcsi, Szilvi, Balázs and Tamás.) It was a special experience spending New Years Eve at the beach, taking a swim. The water was clean and calm. I guess I don't have to say anything about the blue seawater... We enjoyed it a lot, and it was nice to see how grown-ups unveil their inner child . by FERENC IVANICS We reached the Caribbean at Cancún. I guess most of you have seen pictures of the blue Caribbean Sea . I always thought those were images altered in Photoshop, a computer generated exaggeration. We've seen the Mediterranean of the French and the Spanish, The Atlantic in Africa and in Miami, the Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. and in Mexico. Their beaches were playing in another league . This is something totally different. The color of the water is amazing. So it's not surprising that Cancún is the "capital" of tourism is Mexico. An 18 miles long beach sprinkled with luxurious hotels that suit your every need... Well, we think it's interesting but very distant from us.
Well, I said I would be posting something when inspiration struck me - didn't think it would take this long. I have finally written something, so thought I'd post it... A small boy on a beach ran to me last week and gave me a winkle. A winkle, such a strange and sad little object. I shook and then brushed the sand from it. Poor creature, I thought. I took the shell and listened but I could not hear the sound of the sea blowing from within. Instead, I fancied I heard crying. Yes, there was a dry sob, sob, sob coming deep from within. So strange. I immediately wished to smash the shell, to dash it on the deck like a greedy gull, but fought the urge. One thought was playing in my head, like a record, jumping and stuck on the same syllables; like a drifting soul song trapped in purgatory. "Plant me." "Plant me," it spoke. "Plant me." So I did. I scrabbled in the dirt, tossing the clods and broken earthworms aside. In my bluster I'd chopped these worms in half or worse. No matter, I thought - they'll grow anew. Regeneration you see - I'm creating new life and new worth. Dropping the shell into the moist hollow I carefully recovered the jumble of soil and cloven earthworms, imprisoning the gentle winkle. And then I waited. I waited for it to grow. And the rains came and the sun shone down and the winds blew the blossom from the boughs. All seemed but in requiem to the sad little shell. The thought dawned upon me, smiling grimly, spreading icily across my body like electrical current. I had not planted, but had rather buried the poor creature. Now, beneath the dying pink flowers, it was lost to me. I must be mad, I thought. Really, I must now be insane. Hi, Just thought I'd say, you can catch up with me on Twitter. I'll be posting random bits of writing here: http://twitter.com/paulbernard Cheers, Paul. Hi guys, Well, I returned from my week away from blogging refreshed and considering my next move. It's been six months since I started The Daily Tale and I thought it might be a good idea to freshen the format up, try something a little different. So I have created a new blog called The Daily Postcard where I will do my daily blogging from now on. The Daily Tale was an unexpected success and I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to support me by reading the stories and leaving such great comments. However, I think the format had gone as far as it could and I was chomping at the bit to try something a little different. I'm quite into photography and wanted to devote some time to that, along with writing. So that's kind of what the concept of The Daily Postcard is - a photo and a short tale to accompany the image. I hope it will become something the browser can either just dip in and out of when they feel like, or alternatively let their imagination become swept up in the twin assault of the image and the words. My reasoning for starting it on another blog site was so that I could leave The Daily Tale blog here as an archive for anyone who wanted to flick back and read their favourite stories again. When I've finished my Postcard project I will seek to do the same with that too. So that's all, I think. I hope you'll join me in The Daily Postcard . See you on the other side... Please follow the link to The Daily Postcard: http://thedailypostcard.blogspot.com/ Hello all, I am taking a short hiatus from my Daily Tale-ing. I will be on holiday for a week and then, when I return there will be a revamp in order for my daily blog. I hope you'll be back in a week to experience it... Paul. " 'Cos I heard it in the wind and I saw it in the sky, And I thought it was the end, I thought it was the fourth of July " Chris Cornell I saw a firework, dead, burnt, on the street. I reflected on how sad its resting place, how briefly it had burned and now how ignominious its fall. At one time it had potential. Potential to explode and cause delight. Always while it had potential it was a special thing. A device of magic, waiting to bring wonder. In its short life of usefulness it was above us all. It could fly, it could shower us with metallic petals of light. Great golden arcs that would shard in the sky. And then, dropping black and crippled onto an unlit street corner it could now only move if kicked or gusted by a force of nature. Still, at least it had fulfilled its potential. She looked at the image long and hard. She scratched her head to show him that she was thinking about, thinking long and hard. She moved her head around to jaunty angles, ways that she almost never moved her neck. No matter what she did, or how she considered the possible illumination of the piece of artwork he displayed proudly before her she couldn’t ascertain any relevant meaning from it. It really was just a mess of paint to her. She contemplated telling him this. Maybe he’d appreciate what it said to her, but she bit her tongue. She bit her fingernail as well and then stopped in case he was looking at her. He wasn’t looking. He was sat on an old red sofa, spotted with paint and ripped open in places so that the stuffing poured out like fat. The sofa was turned away from the easel, away from where he worked so that he could at least try to switch off from his mind’s displays for a while. The radio was on at that low volume that is as annoying as too loud. He was thinking, this artist, about something someone had said to him earlier. He stared at the music coming from the radio. He found that he often realised that something interesting, something insightful about another person, had been revealed to him in conversation and he would only pick up on it later. By this time, the conversation had long faded to dust and there was little chance to query the interesting party. Another wasted opportunity. “Celine,” he called without taking his eyes from the stereo. “What do you think?” She stopped looking at the splurge on the canvas before her and bit her nail again. “Well, I loved the funny picture of the radioactive clown,” she said. “Very surreal!” He smiled and nodded. He was pleased enough, but he found himself fighting not to ask her about the latest piece, the work he was proudest of. “I’m glad you liked it,” he said. “Honestly, I am.” She moved uncomfortably in her jeans. They were just a little too tight and she felt it now as she walked back to the couch. The room was lit by just the spotlights pointing on the two easels and as she stepped away from these she felt more confident. She picked up her long drink and nibbled the edge of the glass. There was room to sit next to the artist, on the couch, but Celine opted for a leather armchair facing him. She sat down slowly with her knees together and sipped her drink. The spotlights flared in her ice-cubes as she tipped the glass back. “It’s a shame,” said the man, “that you didn’t like The Vision.” He referred here to the title of the strange abstract painting, and not in some grandiose way to his overall method or philosophy of painting. The girl gulped her drink hard and swallowed an ice cube. It stuck in her chest and made her entire body tense up. She gritted her teeth against the cold. “It’s not that I didn’t like it,” she said. “It’s that I didn’t understand it.” She fumbled now as the ice moved on away from her chest, “I’m sorry, sorry about that Robert. I just didn’t quite get it, maybe.” “It’s a shame for us both, that you preferred the clown,” he said. His words barely hung there for a second before her reply: “Why, Robert?” Robert shook his head, then dropped it to the side a little and raised his eyes to look at her. His eyes looked softly and sadly upon her. “Maybe you don’t know why yet. But you will later,” he said. They didn’t say anything for a minute or so. Just looked. A buzzer sounded at the door. A man spoke. “It’s David,” Celine said. “Shall I tell him to come up?” “No, it’s fine. I have to finish up here. I’m tired. Goodnight Celine.” Celine stood awkwardly and put down her glass. She looked down at Robert for a moment and then turned and stepped carefully across the wooden floor to the door, unbolted its latch and pulled hard. The great old metal door swung on creaking hinges. “Goodnight Robert. I really did like your pictures, you know?” Robert nodded. “Don’t forget to lock the door behind me,” she said, stepping out of one world and into another. A man standing on a beach casts his pet octopus into the sea. He holds it by three of its legs and swings it in dizzying circles before letting go to send it flinging back into the sea where it was spawned. As it plops into the water, a red ball, he hopes it’s the last he’ll see of that octopus. Sinking into its new home, the octopus lingers in the swell, growing accustomed to the new tastes and sights, but soon it spreads its legs and swims off into the deeper waters, in search of dark rocks and things to eat. The man sits down on the sand. He has had that octopus for three years. It was a treasured gift of a former lover, now gone. The waves break ever so gently on this shore. So gently, in fact, that the short breakers have created a tiny shelf at the point where the sand remains dry and full. Upon this shelf climbs a green crab. It has come from the sea, allowing itself to be deposited there by the tide. It sidles towards the man, unnoticed, then nips at his sandals and toes. “Woah!” the man lets out expressions of concern. He looks for some flotsam to flick this crab away or something heavy with which to crush its shell. But before he can find this he hears a voice. “Brian, what have you done?” He stares down at the green crab. “You have cast away your only friend.” The crab speaks. And it addresses him by name. “Strange creature,” says Brian. “How came you to speak so, and know my given name?” The green crab replied that he was one of the great seers of the sea, and with the lobster, the ray and the narwhal, views all that occurs both above and below the waves. “The cockles sang to me, from the rocks over there,” continued the green crab. “And then the sprats and starfish whispered to each other that the octopus had returned to us, before his time.” The green crab explained that the octopus was a great talisman, a conduit between the realms of sea and land. Such creatures were placed in homes throughout all the continents of the world, allowing the seers to get a clear view of the airy world above them, helping them make decisions and policies for life under the sea. “Even your partner, Selkie, was put into your life by us. Once she thought a bond had been established between you and the octopus she knew she had to return to the ocean.” “Now, you must go and retrieve your octopus, Brian. You must try. Only you can find it.” And with these words the green crab motioned with its right claw, beckoning Brian towards the sea. Brian stood up, proudly and with purpose, now. He had to do this, he knew, though it seemed impossible. He would swim and swim, and search and search, until he found his red octopus once more. He stepped into the light foam of the surf and pushed on until he was waist deep. Then he turned back towards the crab and waved. The green grab seemed to be waving too. Brian lifted his legs from the sandy sea bed and started to swim and swim. It was difficult to move his arms though, and his legs cut sluggishly through the water. He looked to his arm as he tried to take it from the water. Fifteen small octopuses of various colours were clinging to it, dragging on it. As he stopped swimming he felt the myriad suckers of a thousand tentacles attaching themselves to his body. Hundreds of octopuses grappled with him and he began to feel sharp stinging sensations across his body. A larger tentacle then wrapped about his head and Brian slowly disappeared beneath the blue waters. The green crab, safe on the shore, stopped waving and skittered off across the wet sand, feeling satisfied and looking out for a warm rock pool to hunt in. The three lads, bounding through the weeds at the trackside stopped for breath. Johnny, the youngest, legs wobbling with the effort, wanted to sit down but he fought that feeling with all his might. He was out with his dad now. His brother, Michael, stood up as straight as he could, sucked in a lungful of air and puffed out his chest proudly. His father patted his head rather heavily. Dad had come to see them today and their mother had rolled her eyes. It was their uncle’s birthday, their dad had said, and so he had thought of something for them all to do. ‘A family outing’, he called it. They’d crawled under wire fences, scrambled down dirty banks and jumped from heights that Johnny had previously thought impossible to survive. These were all things his mother and his teachers had told him never to do, but here he found himself, on an overgrown railway embankment, with his father, watching the trains go by. “Not far to go now, guys,” said Peter. He was revelling in his new found role of leader, a figure to be feared and obeyed. “Just round the next bend,” he said, “that’s where it happened.” They hacked onward with their feet until they came to a brown stone wall. Peter led them slowly down the bank and onto the gravel at the side of the railway track. A curving tunnel opened cavernously before them. “Right,” he said. “When I say the word we’re going to run for it. There shouldn’t be another train for 10 minutes anyway, but we’re better safe than sorry.” Michael looked a little incredulous at this, but Johnny pushed in front of him, eager to race away into the darkness at his father’s command. “Now come on, son. Michael’s first up and then you follow him on. I’ll be close behind you, okay?” Johnny nodded; Michael said nothing and just stared ahead into the gloom and then at his shoes. “Alright go,” said Peter, but Michael didn’t move. “Come on Mike, head up and run for it.” Michael’s body moved, almost imperceptibly, but again he held himself back. “For God’s sake Mikey, fucking go for it you prick!” His father raised his voice and his hand and Michael was away. He ran blindly into the darkness, stumbling upon the rail and then vanishing. His father screamed after him to bear left and not to trip on the tracks, his voice echoing about him in madness. Peter held Johnny by the shoulders as the child strained to follow his brother. As soon as his son stopped struggling, Peter plunged ahead of him onward into the tunnel. He found it curved round gently and then light flooded back into its far mouth. Out into the daylight, not far up the track, Michael sat on the rail, crying. Peter ran on, out of the tunnel towards his eldest son but his mind was gripped by responsibilities and he turned around to see what he’d forgotten. Johnny came then, whimpering out of the darkness, rubbing his red eyes and peering at his father with that look of fear and disappointment that can tear at a man’s chest. Peter strode towards him, picked the boy up with one arm and then stumbled across the thickly piled gravel at the railside until they reached Michael. He resisted the urge to grab the lad roughly with his spare arm, instead holding out a hand to him. “Come on,” he urged, adding: “I’m sorry.” Michael looked up graciously and took the hand. Soon they were all sitting on the grass bank looking back at the railway. “This is it,” said their father. “This is the spot where your uncle Mikey died.” They all stared at a spot on the track and imagined it happening there. Noticing there were two different sets of tracks before him, Johnny spoke up with a sniff: “Dad, which side was it, that uncle Mikey got hit by the train?” His father looked long and hard at the two sets of track and didn’t answer for a minute. He realised he couldn’t remember. He had no idea any more. Peter scratched his beard a little, turned to his boys and pointed at the track nearest them. Three pairs of eyes converged on that point. A horn sounded in the tunnel and a train rushed by. “It’s early,” said Michael.
Waiting for the World Cup is like shoving my face full of Christmas cookies and counting the hours to Christmas. I'm saving my voice up so l can scream my head off like Chewbacca at the vet. Here's a translation for those of you who don't speak Dutch: "The Dutch are driving now... and the ball falls to DeBoer... oh wait, the delivery guy just walked in. Thank you Mr. Delivery man for this giant meat grinder. I'll just... OH MY GOD MY ARM! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! ARRRHHHHH! DEAR LORD! Please someone call an ambulance." On a lighter note, nothing seals a goal like an a little operatic improv. SATAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ..... I'm good! I'm good! How you living, brohaim? ..... { Sigh } Yes. I know you're not technically alive. Don't be snarky. What I mean is, how's it going? What's the 411 on the 666? ..... Oh word? That's cool. ..... Me? Just chillin'. Kicking it at work, you know. Slow motion, playa. Sitting here playing minesweeper, hating on my mark ass buster boss who thinks I'm actually gonna come in on Saturday and work on the big presentation. He's bugging. So wack.Wish I was home blazing an L-Ron Hubbard playing COD4. Instead I'm stuck in this stupid office, on some straight up Dilbert shit. Whatever. It is what it is. How's your day going? ..... That's cool. Hope the rest of the day goes OK for you. I just wanted to call to thank you for the awesome birthday present. So thanks. I dig it! ..... Yes, I do really like it! ..... Stop. It's a great gift. What's not to like? I love McDonald's. I love chatting. How can I not fucking love it? It's easily the best phone I've ever owned. ..... I mean it! I tell ya, it definitely beats the pants off the faggy pocket watch the wife got me. ..... Hahaha! I know, right? What is this, The Industrial Revolution? She must think I'm 158 years old. Why would I want that for my birthday? Get me an Ipod, get me a set of Golf clubs. But why get me a fucking pocket watch on a chain? It's ridiculous. ..... No, no, no. I'm not being dramatic. Satan. She's an idiot. ..... I don't care if it sounds harsh. I married a shockingly stupid person. I think I know why she got me this. But it doesn't make her any less of a retard for doing it. ..... One time I watched "Antique Roadshow" with her and mentioned how old things are kind of cool...you know, just to say something so she wouldn't talk. I didn't really mean it. One little comment and now she thinks I'm Winston Churchill. God, she's dumb. ..... Yes. She is stupid. Just because she got a 1412 on her S.A.T.'s doesn't mean she isn't a freaking r-tard. Those tests are culturally biased anyway. ..... Regardless, the point is the watch she gave me sucks. I suppose it wouldn't suck if I worked on a Steam train inside a Mark Twain novel. But I don't. So that makes her an idiot for giving me Scrooge Bling when it's 2010 outside. Did we lose a war or something? I don't work in a textiles factory in London in 1836. I work here. In a shitty office with fluorescent lights, surrounded by fat nerds and computers that are smarter than me, in a futuristic age of scientific discovery and technological advances, not in the motherfucking past. So, she's an idiot. That's all I'm saying. ..... Well, agree to disagree. Way to take her side, by the way. ..... You are taking her side. Very dickish of you. You can't be the Devil's Advocate. You're the Devil. Choose one and stop being an asshole. ..... Whatevs. Let's drop it. Anyway, Speaking of the ladies, If I tell you something, do you promise to keep it on the D.L. Hughley? ..... Just promise, asshole. I don't care if you're the Devil. You can promise me. ..... Ok. So check it out: You won't believe the amount of Poontang this phone is getting me!!! ..... Yes, bro! I'm not lying! It's silly. I'm like Lorenzo Lamas up in this motherfucker. ..... Believe me. Shorties are feeling the double arches. I'm baggin' digits like the Hamburglar! High five! ..... { Sigh } The Hamburglar? The striped guy who hung out with Grimace and Mayor McCheese and stole burgers? From the McDonald's ads? Jesus Christ, do you get cable down there? ..... Whatever. Google it. All I know is that this Ronald McDonald jump off is totally the new Iphone. Tell everyone. Go blog it out! I just tweeted that shit like 12 seconds ago. ..... Yes I am! I'm calling you from it right now! How rad is that? All hail the Dark Lord! You are truly the Master of Evil and supreme emperor of casual gifting! Booyah! Up top! ..... Listen...I was wondering what you're doing later...See I got these Carrot Top tickets my dickhead boss isn't using, and was wondering if you're not busy torturing the damned tonight if you wanna catch the show with me, maybe catch a brew or two, play some Big Buck Hunter... ..... Oh. Yeah. I'll hold. Pug Life. I watched a ton of figure skating this past Olympics. It's awesome. It's the Freddy Mercury of the Sporting world but with more falling and less good music. (Actually no good music.) I watch it because I like theatricality in my winter sports. I also like sparkly things and public humiliation, so it really works for me. But one thing has me coming back every time: The falls. The falls are so fucking amazing. Some kid from Farawayistan practices tornado jumps and triple lutzes 14 hours a day at gunpoint hoping for the big day when all their work will pay off, only to have life sucker punch them in the grundle precisely at the moment of their promised glory. I feel so bad for them when it happens, but I can't avert my eyes. Talk about having your dreams taken away. And how much must it suck to have Bob Costas narrating your life's single most embarrassing moment. As if you already didn't feel bad enough, now you have a Paddington Bear inspired man child mocking you with a voice beautiful yet full of judgement and disdain. You can almost see God's hand reaching down from Heaven balling up into a giant fist, then obliterating these poor souls until all that is left of them is sadness. Glittery piles of pulverized sadness. That being said I can't help but wonder who feels worse: An ice skater who falls flat on their face in front of millions and millions of disappointed friends, family, and countrymen, or B: Kurt Kobain while watching this video? B. By a landslide. I hope Zombie Kurt Kobain rises from the dead just to eat this man's brains. (via Craplinks ) Fun fact: The well tanned circus bears that raised Dolph Lundgren taught him to sing, dance and ride a unicycle in the hopes that he could put some "threat" back in the term "triple threat". But Dolph learned a lot of from the human world as well, like how to wear a tuxedo and not be afraid of fire. Thus, our hero can make a well dressed torch wielding entrance (at about 0:50). Yes, strange things are afoot on planet Sweden, otherwise known as the Graceland of Scandinavia. From Sweden, we travel half way around the world to St. Petersburg for another world champion of outstanding greatness, Edward Khil. Clear evidence that the iron curtain was an effective policy: This guy was kept in and Yakov Smirnoff was let out. Don't get me wrong, I love Yakov but as the great man himself once said. "In Soviet Russia, you don't laugh at the state of the country and in America no state in the country laughs at you". But, seriously what is up America? We used to lead the world in prodcution of ridiculous variety shows. Giants of the small screen like Laugh-in, the Gong Show and Hee Haw testified to our greatness. Somehow, somewhere between the Jerry Springer and the Backstreet Boys, America lost her way. We've got to get back to simpler times. We've got to strap on a smile, activate the jazz hands and show um what we've got. Come on people, how's about a little less Julius Caesar and a little more Cesar Romaro? Someone's Twitter account just sent me a Viagra ad. (Actually, it was a Viagra knock off. Viagra doesn't need to advertise. But that's not the point. ) The point is this: A human I actually know in flesh form had their microblogging alter-ego possessed by an invisible (yet clearly capitalist) computer-robot, designed with the sole intention of selling me synthetic sex enhancers in pill form while disguised as a person I've known for years, leaving me feeling violated and manipulated. Future: 1, Me: 0. I'm old fashioned, I guess. But I swear that this event is important somehow. My gut tells me it's another sign that robots are taking over the world. And my gut's gut tells him he's probably right. This shit happens all the time to people like us (internet/tech users), but not to those Outlanders who for some reason stay off the grid (non-nerds, seniors, mountain folk). It's weird and unsettling if you step back and think about it. It feels like the old guy that oversees the logic center of my brain just crossed an item off his Armageddon bucket list. You might think I'm crazy. It's just spam. What's the big deal? The big deal is, if this message was sent with exactly the same content but delivered as snail-mail instead, (the kind I grew up with, also known as "mail" mail), I'd only be able to come to the conclusion that someone took my friend hostage and sent me a ransom letter demanding I buy dick pills or else I never get to see him again. We put too much faith into people's social network identities. So what exactly happens to the internet version of you when your friends' internet versions of themselves go missing? Do you call the Architect from the Matrix? Dial 311 and ask for Tron? Put up flyers on Facebook walls until they come back to us? God. It's all so befuddling. I get caveman hands trying to type about it. Just imagine what the grizzle-faced rapey dudes from "Deliverance" would think if you tried explaining this to them. They'd be so mesmerized by the pops and clicks in those fancy college words coming out of your pretty, city-slicker mouth that they might just forget to anally rape you long enough for you to make a run for it. Oh well, I guess it's all inevitable. I'm just glad this particular pirate-tweet is one with health benefits in mind. If I have to have internet ninja robots hacking into my world from now until I die, it's better to have a cool one doing it rather than one of those asshole robots. Because evil or not, a robot that wants to make my penis strong is far more preferable to getting a email confirmation from Skynet telling me they're sending one of their special T-1000 Life Technicians somewhere between 2 and 5 tomorrow in order to disconnect my life service. Well, podcast 2 has arrived in the mail and damn! it's over 30 minutes long. Enjoy. (Click here to get to the Downloadings) (photo via realtybs )
Some people just walked around experiencing all the amazing colour blends; others sat and chilled out  - sitting in a pod and chatting or just laying back and relaxing with the background music. An integral part of the Adelaide Festival is Writers Week, held this year from 28th Feb to 5th March.  A daily free event is held in Pioneer Women's Memorial Gardens just off of King William Road. The program includes writers from Australia and abroad - panel discussions, 'Meet the Author' sessions, lectures and readings. This drinking fountain was built in 1887 in memory of John Gardener, a firefighter, who lost his life in a blaze in a Rundle Street shop on Christmas Eve in 1886. The funds for the memorial were raised from public donations.Another firefighter, Albert  Clark, also lost his life in the fire. He is buried at North Road Cemetery in Nailsworth, with a simple gravestone to remember him by.The ABC Wednesday meme was initiated by Denise Nesbitt. To find out more about ABC Wednesdays and see other participants' contributions click here. Here in Adelaide for the Fringe, this inflatable structure is a luminarium; a series of tunnels and domes measuring 1000 square metres. Amococo is a walk in sculpture that is designed to stimulate one's senses with magnificent display of light and colour.You can view a video here to give you an appreciation of the experience. On Saturday Adelaide was treated to a fireworks/lightshow extravaganza. Brought to us by Groupe F from France; a fitting celebration of the 50th anniversary of our Festival of Arts that runs from 26th Feb to 14
A while back I made my way to Village Haus for a hamburger. I recalled my sweeper days when I would enjoy a quick burger at the break room downstairs below the restaurant. There is a service window for cast members at the far western end of the main counter (it is behind the wall, just inside the service door there). A diet Coke, Village Haus burger and fries provided me with sustenance on many days. It was hardly haute cuisine, but it was good enough. Better yet, it was cool to wind my way through the corridor in the back area and down the stairs. There, in the bowels of the building, was another hallway that led to the break room on the left and restrooms on the right. Breaks in that windowless room were fluorescent -filled and usually quiet. The room was a pretty good size, with tables and chairs and the obligatory TV set on the wall (usually out of service). Of course, sometimes we would arrange our breaks so that a few of us would head down there together. The company was nice. We always had a good time. No, there are not tunnels under Disneyland everywhere (like at Disney World). However, there are a few underground spots---beneath Tomorrowland Terrace and the old America Sings building in Tomorrowland, below New Orleans Square at the old Pit and under Fantasyland and the Village Haus, to name a few. Lucky me. I have seen them all. This is Mike, signing off. Enjoy your weekend Jungleteers! ---Mike Today is Post Some More Old Photos Day here at Jungle is 101. Sadly, it is not a national holiday. It is, however, recognized as a half-day-without-pay in the Republic of Malta. So we've got THAT going for us...which is nice. Moving right along and to our immediate left, please note a vintage photograph of the Pirates' queue before "the Bridge" was erected. Must've been pretty early, as guests could practically walk onto the attraction. Based on costuming and guest clothing, I'm putting this one in the 1980s. Next: the only known photograph of a failed rescue mission to save the Lost Safari in 1987. A host of Adventure/Frontier Attractions cast members somehow managed to find their way to this remote beach. Sadly, not one of them seemed to notice the missing expedition, as the cast members' attention was distracted by my passing boat and camera crew. Since the Lost Safari had long provided me with some of my best material, I was careful not to point them out. How those folks from Thunder and the Sailing Ship Columbia made their way to this corner of the teeming jungle remains a mystery. Finally: a few of my sweeper peeps from back in the day, yo. Looks like another tough day at Custodial Control. To the left of the photo, the poster board bears undeniable proof of the fact that we actually received training on how to sweep up trash and use a gum scraper as part of our "function and responsibilities." On the shelf at the right of the photograph are various tools of the trade: boxes of Kimbies (paper towels sweepers carried like ammo), cleaning solutions, spray bottles of muriatic acid and a box of lye. This had to be taken close to the end of the shift, otherwise I have no explanation for why these poor people look so flogging happy. Their demeanor could possibly be explained as some sort of after-effect of the off-gassing of volatile organic compounds from the cleaning solutions in Custodial's main offices. We can never know for sure. [I think I have to thank Robin Mora or Jerry Lofquist for originally posting this---not sure where I found it, but I'm glad I did]. ---Mike It is late on a June night in 1984 and I am working in Fantasyland as a sweeper. By late, I mean it is the early morning and Disneyland has ended its normal operating day. The last few stragglers have been walked out to Main Street by Security and I am alone in the bullpen for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. This was back when the statue of Toad, just inside the front window of the queue, still had its left arm and hand raised, with the fingers pinching his monocle. The monocle never survived being constantly swiped by guests. So for a period of time we would routinely find Mr. Toad holding in his pinched fingers a cigarette---usually with the ends twisted so as to look like an illicit substance often smoked by Cheech and Chong. These unique cigarettes were placed there by some creative guests while waiting in line. Later, as we see in the picture to the left, Toad's left arm appeared to have been taken off and put back on upside down so that it bent BEHIND Toad's back (in a pose reminiscent of someone hiding a bouquet of flowers before giving it to a loved one). The statue in question used to look just like the "stone" statue of Toad that graces the attraction's entrance facade. Take a look. See the left arm and the monocle? Remove monocle and you have a magnificent spot for a "cigarette." As always, I digress. What was my point? Ah, yes...flowerbeds. The closing shift for a sweeper involved spending the last hour or so picking trash out of the many flower beds in your assigned area. Fantasyland---especially the area in the heart of the realm---left me with the most pleasant memories of this otherwise mundane task. Black, bulky, Disney-issued flashlight in hand, as I swept through the area during closing, I would shine the beam across the flower beds, illuminating cigarette butts, popcorn containers, remnants of Mickey balloons, gum, straw wrappers, cups, ticket stubs, Souvenir Guides, popcorn pieces, drink lids, cellophane, and other detritus that would find its way from the hands of guests into the beds. I would pick up these pieces or sweep them into my pan, one bed at a time, until I'd make a complete circuit. I would usually start this process by Dumbo's calliope and work my way around the flower beds, past Village Haus, Pinocchio, Snow White, Tinker Bell's Toy Shop, the Castle courtyard, and back up the other side---Peter Pan, Mr. Toad, the Mad Hatter and over to Alice and back along the Storybookland canal near Monstro. Each of us sweepers would be going through this process in our respective areas. Our lead would meander through the area, checking on us and occasionally helping out. The area music remained turned on during the whole process and, of course, the area lights. What made it special was the fact that we became the only humans in the realm once the guests had been walked out by security. To be one of four or five people in all of Fantasyland---from Castle to Small World---was a pretty cool thing. Dumbo's calliope would bounce out its happy carousel tunes in the background and I would find myself picking to the music on occasion. We sweepers developed a posture for attacking the flower beds. A foot would be slid under the painted wrought iron fence that surrounded the bed and the sweeper would lean forward over that leg to get at stuff closest to the fence line. If you walked through the area during a closing shift, you would see a virtual ballet of sweepers' rear ends in the air and heads down as they bent over their flower beds with flashlights. Between flower beds, I would sometimes just stop for a moment and take it all in. The lights, the music, the flowers, the familiar attractions, the cobblestones. Once again, me and the Park. Maybe I'm selfish---who isn't at times?---but there are moments when the Park feels like it is there just for me. I wish each Disneyland-o-phile could have that unique opportunity: to be alone in an area of the Park, even for just a few minutes. At the end of the shift, our area crew of sweepers would gather into a group and make our way back to the Custodial locker. We would then go to the locker room and Wardrobe, to turn in our costume, change and head home. We were a closely-knit group. Indeed, this blog is a testament to the lasting impact that those precious few days as a Cast Member had on me. It is either that or some strange sort of mental illness that keeps me at the keyboard, posting this stuff. As my dear friend Mr. Gump would oft impart, "That's all I have to say about that." ---Mike It is a tradition lost to the ravages of time: launching a Skipper into the river on his last day on Jungle. Our thanks to Ed Cunningham, fearless skipper of the early 80s---and (thankfully) someone who bothered to document the antics (and keep the photos). Ed originally posted these pics of what was no doubt his last day on Jungle (even then, Management was not keen on Cast Members swimming in attractions during Park hours). The initial push into the river by a fellow cast member was clearly quite effective, as the victim made it all the way across to the catwalk! Alas, this grand tradition is no longer in favor at modern Disneyland (ahem, "The Disneyland Resort"). This is probably for the best. We've heard tell that Ed suffered from the dreaded "Jungle River Slimepox" on and off for over 27 years after hitting the river. Yeeewwww. By the way, I do not think I will ever tire of seeing photos of the Jungle boats with their striped canopies or the Skipper costumes with the leopard print hat bands. These photographs also help to answer the time honored guest question: "How deep is the water?" In the middle photograph, our victim has resurfaced and is standing on the mucky bottom, with his head and shoulders out of the water. It's that deep. For now, my friends, stay well, keep dry and remember, as Trader Sam used to tell me often: "There's no known cure for Slimepox." So when next you cruise the Jungle, STAY IN THE BOAT! ---Mike All right, I've been bad. Very bad. I have been dealing with a lot in my other life and have neglected my blog. What's strange, though, is that I've actually picked up more followers during this "frozen screen" phase. Perhaps the best way to increase readership of "Jungle is 101" is for me to stop writing... No such luck folks. Today I muse about my first shift as a spry, young custodial host in brilliant sweeper "whites" in May 1984. As the title of this post indicates, I was assigned "Matterhorn Way" in Fantasyland for my first shift "on my own" after training. It is an area of the park (like I need to tell any of you Parkophiles) that runs from the northeast corner of the Hub on Main Street (to the right of Sleeping Beauty's Castle if you are facing the Castle from Main Street) and northeast toward the Small World (on one side) and more easterly toward the queue for Finding Nemo (on the other side---Matterhorn Way splits at the base of the Matterhorn---the Alice side and then the Tomorrowland side). See the photograph from 1985 (note the 30th Anniversary logo on the light pole). It is a section of the parade route for most every Disneyland parade. The main section of Matterhorn way runs between the Matterhorn and the Fantasyland restrooms just south of Alice in Wonderland. It is an open area that is usually not too crowded. It is shaded along its western edge by the trees and the castle wall facade that run along the southeastern edge of Fantasyland. It's a great place to be a sweeper. Plenty of foot traffic. Lots of guest interaction. The bathroom is easily located and most guests can be directed there without a map or a 20 minute geography lesson. The bullpen for the Matterhorn runs in a single line along the base of the mountain---easy to sweep. Just jump in line with your pan and broom, ease along with the guests, sweep as you go and jump back out when you get across from Alice. There are sunny areas but also blessed shade. July and August are rough if your area is a place largely devoid of shade like Tomorrowland or along the Rivers of America (between the River Belle Terrace and Tom Sawyer's Rafts landing). Matterhorn Way is a travelers' zone---people who are going through it are moving to and fro on their way to other places. They usually know where they're going, too, because once one rounds the corner from Main Street, the Small World unmistakingly beckons in the distance, with Alice very obviously to the left and a great, big, white mountain to the right. The echoing roar of Harold sounds from inside the mountain and rolls along Matterhorn Way rhythmically. Sure, you'll get the occasional, "Can you tell me how to get to the Matterhorn?" But there is something deeply satisfying about being able to put on your best Disney smile for the guest, slowly turning toward the megalith behind you, and answering with a two-fingered point, "Why you're almost there! It's that white mountain to my left!" Most smile embarrassedly and nod a thank you as they step into the line. As that young sweeper on his first shift, Matterhorn way was perfect. First of all, for your lead, it was an easy spot to keep track of a newbie. There's nowhere to hide (or get lost). It is also an easy area to point out ("I want you to start at the popcorn cart---hit that area often, by the way---over in front of the Matterhorn and then sweep the area all the way past Alice down to the Hub, and then the back side of the mountain and back along the Alice side to the popcorn cart again, you got that? Don't forget to hit the line every half hour or so and don't forget the restrooms!") It's a spot "between worlds" within the Park. It's a little Main Street, it's a little Tomorrowland, it's a little Fantasyland---all within an area that takes about 15 minutes to cycle through with a pan and broom. Guests enjoyed (and still do enjoy) sitting along the concrete benches south of the restrooms. They are themed to be part of the Sleeping Beauty Castle and are smooth and usually shaded. I often met the most pleasant people seated along there. They were happy to have a conversation with a sweeper. Many were seniors---resting their legs while the rest of the family scurried elsewhere in the Park. "How are you today?" "Just fine," I'd answer. "Where are you from?" "Oh, we're from "X"---we're visiting the grandchildren. What a lovely day! Not too warm for you is it?" "No, I keep moving and there's shade. Besides, those restrooms over there are cool and air conditioned---and they need sweeping!" "I hadn't even noticed. I'm glad you pointed them out! Thank you." Et cetera. I couldn't believe I was actually getting PAID to stand in Disneyland and talk with people! Or to walk through my assigned area with my pan and broom and keep the place Disney clean! (I was pretty gung-ho, I'll admit; you know, even later on the Jungle Cruise, I was quick to pick up trash in the queue or in the boats). For your next visit, your assignment is to take a seat along the concrete Castle benches on Matterhorn Way and people watch for a while. Grab a corn dog or a churro or a turkey leg and take a seat. Watch the guests going by. Better yet, take some time and watch for the sweeper. Be sure to say hello. ---Mike Salutations and best wishes for a healthy, happy, safe and productive new year to all four of you loyal readers! It is kinda silly to have a site meter to track my mom and three other people, but what the heck, it was a free application. Since we tend to look back here at Jungle, there's no better way to start the new year than to compare 1980s Tomorrowland with its present counterpart. The photograph below shows the east side of Tomorrowland viewed from the upper bullpen area of Space Mountain in 1985. Bright primary colors catch the eye, from the Monorail, to the Skyway, to the America Sings building and even the Tomorrowland Terrace umbrellas. Palm trees also rose gracefully to the sky, perhaps evoking a positive, upwardly moving future. This same area today (a touch more crowded) seems a little "off." You can really see how Innoventions was kinda slapped together over the old America Sings building. Hey! They got rid of the flag poles and replaced them with---a triangle thingy! Now there's also a big wet ball in the middle of the walkway. Not sure why. Further, they've added a green tower to the skyline (over at the Autopia ) and replaced a nice shady spot near the old America Sings building with one that's a little less shady. Stainless steel handrails have become brass or rust-colored, too. And what exactly has taken over the old Rocket Jets platform to the upper left of the photo? DirecTV? Dish Network? Enough of that. Next, I share with you a 1985 view of Carnation Plaza Gardens and a link to an old post about this location. This photograph was taken by a guest during Park operating
hours in early 1985. Imagine, open, empty space within Disneyland! Trust me, it can happen. Finally, let's close with a fun shot of several 1985 cast members perched above the moat at the entrance to Sleeping Beauty's Castle. See? Cast members have fun at Disneyland, too. That, I can assuredly and thankfully tell you, is one thing about the Park that has not changed over time! Here's to 2010! May each of your lives continue to grow and add new things! May there continue to be imagination left in the world! ---Mike Ok. Ok. I know---it's been a month since my last post. I have been, shall we say, remiss. But hey, this isn't "Julie &amp; Julia," or even "Mike &amp; Walt." I never promised to post every single day or to cook every dish in Julia Child's first cookbook over the course of a year. Still...if you're gonna be a blogger, I guess you have to actually blog occasionally. Even if you have but four (4), count them, four(4) readers to your name. I have seen somewhere that "Jungle is 101" is described as being a bit on the nostalgic side. That's like saying the Boy Scouts are a bit on the "help-an-old-lady-to-cross-the-street-and-learn-how-to-tie-really-good-knots" side. I confess, when it comes to the Park, nostalgia is my game (though I do seem to recall a post or two relating to my most recent stint as a cast member!). Thanks to the magic of the Internet, I've been able to come across many old photographs from my first tour of duty at the Park. Today, we peek at a few more, starting with the Jungle Cruise crew from 1986-87-ish (thanks to Sue B. for originally sharing this photo). Two of my favorite old skippers (Jimm and Dougg) (they insist on the double consonants) a pictured in the group below (Jimm to the far left and Dougg smack in the middle). See? The hats, the costumes, the canopies, the old seat cushions, 7 cast members on a single boat (doing absolutely nothing but posing for a picture)---Jungle at its finest! I remember the macrame-style belts were a bit cheesy, but overall, we cut a fine form in our Jungle gear, eh? In our next photograph we have old-time skipper "Wally" taking a zip around the rivers of Adventureland on the world famous "skiff." I worked a lot of parade shifts and Mark Twain with Wally. He was a great Jungle captain. Back in the day, they actually trusted us skippers (at least a few of us anyway) to pilot a boat through the Jungle that was not connected to the riverbed. Imagine. Of course, our old lead (Don) was known to pilot an unwitting skipper or two (seated at the front of the skiff) directly under Schweitzer falls for a ceremonial jungle baptism (one of several preferred forms of the ritual---others included: the squirter, the falls, the Spur side, the unload, the front switch, the rear switch, the "it's clear to cross the bow! (and then throttle into reverse suddenly)" to name but a few). Of course, after several times around the Jungle (or more, if the rest of your rotation was mad at you for taking an "extended" break), you would retire to one of the many premier break areas available to Disneyland Cast Members. Each break area came stocked with: (1) a 40-year old vending machine (complete with 40-year old snacks inside), (2) an inoperative change machine (that would instantly spit back any type of bill one attempted to feed into it---from a crisp, newly minted greenback to the more common crumpled single), (3) a bench or table (usually orange for some reason) and (4) a videogame. In a photograph below (originally shared byfrom Lee S.), we see a fellow Thunder cast member (Henry D.) enjoying a few mushroom-shooting moments with Centipede (with an inoperative brown change machine in the background). The old Thunder costumes were also pretty cool (though the boots would absolutely KILL your feet after a typical shift). Some attractions actually permitted the cast member to be both on the clock AND taking a break AT THE SAME TIME. This wonder of the modern workplace was available in many forms around the Park, but none so perfect as the Tiki Room: Here (in another Lee S. photo---thanks Lee!), we see a graphic demonstration of the work/break principle in its purest form, with Dave P. as our Tiki Room attraction operator. Uh, Dave, first you wake up Jose and now THIS? By the way, I think that same chair is STILL at Tiki (though now it's in the "office" in the back and not on stage as depicted above). The photograph of Dave also brings back memories of the Tiki costume. Slacks and an orange Hawaiian shirt made entirely of polyester. Those pants would literally tear the hair off of your legs. They also would not breathe! Nice combo once July and August hit, let me tell you. We close today's post with a 1986 photograph (again thanks to Lee S.) of Jeff Cravello at the turnstile position leading to the Tiki lanai. It looks like the sun is setting and the lights are coming up in Adventureland. Soon Jeff will be hearing the drums of the Tahitian Terrace show rumbling into action behind him. Very 80s specs Jeff is sporting, no? Okay, there is one thing I do NOT miss about 1980s Adventure/Frontier Attractions: Tiki polyester. It took 25 years, but the hair finally has grown back on the front of my thighs. Sheesh. Oh, and in case I don't post between now and then, may each of you have a safe, happy and Merry Christmas! "Jungle Bells! Jungle Bells! Jungle all the way! Oh what fun it is to run...from an elephant about to spray! Hey!!" ---Mike Ah, the old Jungle queue and entrance. Thanks to old Skipper Ed Cunningham for originally sharing the shot below from 1983. You can see we were a different class of Jungle skippers back then---very well turned out, indeed. This group looks like they just got back from the Banana Ball and they haven't even left yet! By the way, dig the prototype for the new Small World boat at the bottom of the photo---this design never caught on for some reason. In scrounging around trying to locate old photographs from back in the day, I found one showing "Arthur" on Main Street from 1983 or 84 (thanks to my old sweeper pal, Robin Mora, for originally sharing this picture). If you weren't around Disneyland when Arthur was a regular...well hopefully this will help you understand a little of what he was like . Let us now raise our glasses...To Arthur! To Arthur! Here! Here! ---Mike

This concept comes to us in many forms. As you sow; so shall you reap. What goes around comes around. You get what you give. An eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth In simple terms, when we chose to do or think good things, good things come back to us (good karma). When we chose to do or think bad things, bad things come back to us (bad karma). Karma is the condition created by the choice. It’s important to remember: The choices we make in every moment will determine the kind of opportunities and experiences we will have in the future. If someone treats us badly we must respond with kindness and understanding (turn the other cheek, as Jesus suggested) in order to generate good karma for the future. If we retaliate and do something unkind in return, the cycle of negative karma will continue and even escalate. “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”, as Gandhi said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A tingling in the air What is this feeling?

Why Ad Blocking is devastating to the sites you love If you read a site and care about its well being, then you should not block ads (or you subscribe to sites like Ars that offer ads-free versions of the site). If a site has advertising you don't agree with, don't go there. I think it is far better to vote with page views than to show up and consume resources without giving anything in return. I think in some ways the Internet and its vast anonymity feeds into a culture where many people do not think about the people, the families, the careers that go into producing a website. People talk about how annoying advertisments are, but I'll tell you what: it's a lot more annoying and frustrating to have to cut staff and cut benefits because a huge portion of readers block ads.

Wake Up Call is a free short story posted by me, your insomniac host, Cheeseburger Brown . Alternative Formats: Kindle | iPad Connected Stories: Simon of Space And now, the complete tale: I. Drillard dreamed. He could tell, because nothing seemed real. His mother pulled him upright while his head lolled, then shoved aside his teddy bear and tugged off his pajamas. She was talking but Drillard couldn't make out a word of it. He was lost in the smell of his childhood bedroom, drooping under a warm blanket of nostalgia, disappearing again behind collapsing eyelids... "Mommy?" The alarm clock was buzzing. His mouth was tacky with the taste of wine. The venetian blinds cast stripes of sunlight across the ceiling, but they were too bright to look at. Drillard rolled into the pillow, muffling away the sounds of traffic whizzing by outside. The pillow smelled like Pauline. He looked up with a gasp, but she wasn't there. How could she be? He was no more a married man than he was a child. No. No, it was raining. Pittering on the ceiling, washing down the windows. Drillard propped himself up on one elbow to watch it, the distorted images of cars smearing past. He wiped his hand down his face. He dug sand out of the corners of his eyes. Brushing his teeth before the mirror he paused to wonder at his face. "Mother Mars," he sighed, "when did I get to look so haggard?" He bathed, he shaved, he shat. He pulled on his pants and looked for his hat. He barked his shin on the coffee table, because he'd forgotten all about it. It had been a part of his life so very long ago, after all. Drillard paused at the doorway, key in his hand, hovering. He felt like he was forgetting something. II. The day was dim, the fat jovian disc Yasu occluding half the sky. Drillard stared at its swirls as he swayed, standing, on the train. He held a loop of leather, hemmed in by his damp fellows. Strings of advertising text marched at eye-level along the windows. Pleasantly the train cooed, "Pilgrim Landing, Pilgrim Landing Station is the next stop." A chime sounded, the doors parted and Drillard was expectorated. A dozen umbrellas unfolded around him with a series of pops. "My umbrella -- I should've remembered my umbrella," he said to himself, but the realization did not assuage his insistent sense of something forgotten. He gathered the lapels of his coat and hunkered his shoulders to sink down into the collar. The city was a vast grey beast towering all around him, the tips of its spires lost to mist, lines of dim traffic snaking between them. Each building had a thousand glowing eyes. Every artery was clogged with viscous streams of umbrella tops. Too many people in too close quarters, elbowing their way to their stalls... Ishtar was a crowded world. The rain irritated him. The gravity felt too heavy today, making him sluggish. He couldn't keep himself from yawning again and again. He found himself lingering aside of the commuter mob when his eye was caught by a glittering storefront display. Others shouldered past him but Drillard remained transfixed. It wasn't new -- he'd passed it many times before -- but this morning it seemed to have a special transfixative quality that inspired in Drillard a bewildering but welcome calm. The animated letters said: PEOPLE LIKE YOU BEGIN NEW HISTORIES. Beneath the headline was a great holographic globe with half its sphere composed of cratered rock while the other was a fractal splatter of blue seas and green continents. Various points of interest were highlighted. The one currently crawling into view indicated a prairie city founded by Ishtari expatriates, their smiling faces enclosed in little circles. As the circles came near they spoke. "I never thought I would find myself the mayor of new world colony, but here I am and loving it!" The backdrop was a continually updating spreadsheet of available jobs, listing salary, benefits, contract length and living conditions. There were calls for terraforming engineers, atmospheric scientists, power plant workers, civil architects, gardiners, pilots, preschool teachers, dentists and barbers and smiths... "I'd go myself if I had a trade," said a vagrant sitting beneath the display. "But that ship has sailed." Drillard looked down at him. The man held up a filthy cup. Drillard dropped a few pennies inside. "Cheapskate," snarled the vagrant. Drillard turned away and walked on, rejoining the throng. Its current carried him to work. He jammed himself into an elevator with too many other people. The car creaked as it ascended. The climb took a very, very long time. Normally nervous, Drillard wondered why he felt no fear. Only numbness. People on the elevator had the same conversations as people on the train. The talk was a hypnotic, sussurussing rhythm of platitudes and slogans and misquoted excerpts of popular entertainments -- a lullabye of inanity. Drillard found himself sagging into the man next to him, then shook himself and straightened. "Sorry," he mumbled. He pinched himself inside his pocket to stifle the next yawn. III. "Keeping you up, Drilly?" Drillard's head rocketed up from his desk, leaving behind a modest pool of drool. He knuckled his sockets and cleared his throat, then smoothed down his shirtfront and wiped away the saliva with a sleeve. "Nearly scared the faeces out of me, Mona." "That's what you get for sleeping on the job," she teased, wagging a finger at him. She peeled off her slick overcoat and tucked herself in behind the desk opposite Drillard's with a flip of her long brown hair. "Late night? Hot date?" "What?" said Drillard, blinking. "Oh God, no. I don't know. I just feel like I can't wake up all the way today...like I'm looking at the world from under a wet blanket. Everything's a bit woolly." Mona nodded sympathetically but instead of setting to work at her terminal she leaned across the desk and pointed a small flashlight directly at Drillard's eye. She clicked it on with her thumb, unleashing a blaze of brightness. "Slightly asymmetric pupil response," she said in a clinical voice. Drillard winced, batting her hand away. "Damn it!" he grunted. "What the hell did you do that for? My eyes are killing me. God, Mona." Mona looked up at him blankly, hands poised over her terminal. "I'm sorry?" "What's with the goddamn light?" She raised a single eyebrow, mouth pinched. She glanced up at the overhead lights. "Are you feeling alright, Drill? I can signal an iteration of the nurseplex if you want." He waved that off. "Forget it. I'll be fine." "You're pale." He tried to summon a hopeful grin. "Maybe I'd feel better if you bought me dinner." She chuckled but it wasn't unkind. "If this is the hangover you have after a date with a mere mortal, what makes you think you could even survive stepping out with the likes of me?" "I'm not hungover, Mona." "You look like you're about to faint." Drillard pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "When I was a teenager," he said into the ruddy darkness behind his lids, "I used to be able to sleep in all morning long. Remember that? I'd sort of surface, look at my clock, and then dip back under and have a million more dreams. The next time I'd come up only five minutes had passed and my parents were still yelling at me to get up and mow the damn lawn." "Sure," said Mona softly. "I remember that." "Sometimes I'd dream that I'd already woken up," he said. "It could be unsettling." When Mona did not reply he opened his eyes again. Rivulets of bent light ran along the ceiling, the rain casting strange caustics between the blinds. The pressure against the back of Drillard's head was not his chair but rather his pillow. He was horizontal. Traffic moaned and swooped and chittered by outside his high-rise window. Drillard's alarm clock was buzzing. IV. "Neurologically, I don't see anything amiss." Dr. Salts turned away from the tomographic display as the gurney Drillard lay upon withdrew from inside the scanning drum. Drillard sat up as soon as his head had cleared the edge. He looked at the rotating image of his brain, the most oxygenated regions glowing gaily blue. "What does it mean, Doc?" "It means your issues are not organic in origin." Drillard sagged. "So I'm cracking up." Dr. Salts raised his brow. "It may simply mean that you're under an unusual amount of stress. Would you like me to subscribe you to an analyst construct? It may help to talk about it." Drillard shook his head. "I just want something to stop me from feeling so drowsy and detached. A medicine -- there must be a medicine I can take!" "I'm sorry Mr. Drillard, but I do not condone the prescription of pharmacological solutions without an accompanying regimen of counselling. It would be irresponsible, you understand, to address your symptoms without attempting to correct the underlying problem." Drillard sighed, then jerked awake. The train cooed, "North Central Medical, North Central Medical Complex is the next stop." He pushed his way through the passengers and staggered out onto the platform. In his hand was clutched his appointment chit for Dr. Salt's office. He looked up at the grand public clock at the end of the platform, but decided against rushing. Was there any point in sprinting for an appointment he had just dreamed he had already had? Was the real Dr. Salt likely to tell him anything much different than the imaginary one? Drillard chucked the chit into the garbage, then changed his mind and went after it, fishing his hand through wet filth until he'd retrieved it. When he arrived at Dr. Salt's office he was quickly disabused of the notion that he might be somehow precognitive, as Dr. Salt was on vacation and his appointments were being handled by a fill-in. Her name was Dr. Sen. "I don't see any neurological issues in your scan," she said, long brown fingers folded on her blotter. "And your bloodwork is normal. In light of this, I'm not convinced your problem is somatic. Have you considered psychotherapy?" "Yeah," he said, nodding vaguely. "Twice, actually." The analyst construct downloaded itself into his home console just as Drillard was finishing supper. He pushed his plate aside, turned off the soccer game and then watched the progress bar fill on the display. A chime sounded. "Good evening," said a smoothly modulated artificial voice. "Tell me about your mother." Afterward, he went to a bar. After that he found himself knocking on an unfamiliar apartment door. He was as surprised as anyone when Mona answered. "...Drilly?" "Can I come in?" he mumbled, already moving forward. She sat cross-legged on the sofa in pink pajamas, a mug of steaming tea between her thighs. Drillard paced back and forth in front of the wide wall of windows that overlooked the city's bright core. "So basically the damn thing tells me I hate my job, I'm sick of my life, and if I don't want to get stuck in a cycle of worsening depression I've got to make some big changes." Mona furrowed her brow, arms crossed. "What kind of changes, Drill? I mean, you've applied for employment amelioration like ten times. What else can you do? Retrain? What would you study?" He licked his lips, still pacing. "Maybe I should just leave." "Leave? Where would you go? Out East?" "Offworld," he replied, eyes flashing. "Maybe I could go offworld." Mona drew in her breath sharply. Drillard couldn't be sure but it seemed to him that there was something almost impressed in her expression. Hesitantly she said, "Do you really think you're cut out for that kind of life?" He snorted. "Well, clearly I'm not cut out for this one. Just ask the goddamn analyst construct." "Tell me about your mother..." "That's not funny." She opened a bottle of wine, explaining it had been set aside for a date who had stood her up. Drillard heard himself say that seemed unlikely. She shrugged as she poured out two glasses. "Don't bothering buttering me up," she replied tartly, setting the bottle back on the table. "You know full well I'm lightyears out of your league, Drill. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just the truth." Drillard nodded. "Yeah, I know." "No matter how you shake it I'm B-3 and you're C-5, and my mama taught me to never fool around outside my genetic cohort." He nodded again. "Yeah. I guess when everything feels like a dream it just seems like anything might be possible. It's the underappreciated upshot of losing your grip." She offered him a wan smile and reached out to touch his shoulder. "Poor Drilly. If you ever did kiss me you know what would happen, don't you? You'd wake right up." The snapped her fingers then tried to force a laugh. He glanced down. "You're falling out of your pajamas." Mona turned pink and hit him with a pillow. "Go home, Drill," she said, crossing her arms over her chest again. "It's late." "Sure," he agreed, draining his glass. "Thanks for listening." He turned around and scooped up his jacket from the floor, and when his head came up again he banged it hard against the upper edge of the scanning drum. "Damn it!" he bellowed, stars winking through his vision. Dr. Sen was peering in at him. "Mr. Drillard, have you hurt yourself?" Drillard said an unprintable word as the gurney slid out of the scanner. He sat up all the way and rubbed at his throbbing forehead. When he opened his eyes again Dr. Sen was staring at him splayed out on the gurney with his hospital chemise tented impressively over his erection. He crossed his legs quickly. "How long was I out?" "Out?" echoed Dr. Sen. "But you've only just gone into the scanner." Drillard pressed his lips together grimly. "Something serious is happening to me, doctor, I know it," he whispered. "I just wish I could remember what it is." V. "Wake up!" Drillard groaned. "Wake up, God damn you, wake up Drill!" He smelled baby powder and sex. He opened his eyes. He was curled up in a twisted piece of pink comforter. Along the headboard: mineral water, exfoliating facial scrubs, cinnamon massage oil. Standing over him: Mona with a silk sheet clutched against her front. "What?" stammered Drillard. "Oh my God ," shrieked Mona. "What did you put in my wine you bastard?" "But we didn't do anything -- you sent me home, remember?" Mona snatched up a pair of pants and began flogging at him with them. "Liar!" she cried, face screwed up tightly in fury. "I can't believe this. I can't believe you. I can't believe my own friend -- we've been friends for three years, Drill! -- my own friend would take advantage of me like this! I hate you!" Drillard tried to shield himself as she started picking up random things from the floor and lobbing them at his head. "I didn't do anything!" he pled, taking a shoe to the temple as gracefully as he could manage. "I'm ovulating you idiot! Do you know what this means? I'm B-fornicating-3!" Drillard's mouth went dry. "You can abort. They won't even give you a hassle, because I'm just C-5. You can say I forced you!" "You did force me!" She punched him the face. Drillard rolled backward off the bed and hit the wall, upsetting a vanity and sending vials of cosmetics crashing in all directions. He tasted blood. "Stop!" he wailed. "I thing you broge by node!" Naked and furious, Mona wrenched the fallen vanity up over her head. Before Drillard could object she swung it down upon him. He had raised one arm defensively, and it was this arm he felt break first. Then the bulk of the furniture careened into his head and everything went dark and awful. Beep. Drillard stirred. Beep. His eyes opened slightly, admitting a painful light. He slowly gained awareness of a body as heavy as weak. When he lolled his head he heard the crisp whispers of a starched pillow against his ears. Beep. A white room. Sun-dappled leaf shadows spread along the wall. Sickly sweet smell of old flowers. A machine at his elbow reporting audibly on his respiration. Beep. The smell of disinfectant and cologne, vomit and ozone. Tinny voices paging specialists. "Doctor, Mr. Drillard is ready for your examination." Two long faces looked in over Drillard, his own pallid and slack features reflected in their cold eyes. Together they discussed his bowel movements and glucose levels, then one of them drew out a little flashlight and clicked it on with his thumb as he pointed it first into Drillard's left eye, then his right. Drillard was tr
pped inside himself. He could neither move nor speak. "I'd like to test the gag response." "Heart rate is elevating." "Show me the realtime cochlear data. Is he hearing us?" Drillard's rehabilitation began immediately. He was weak as a kitten. He was propped up on pillows with an intravenous line attached to his ludicrously skinny arm, and asked many simple questions like whether he felt up to counting backwards from twenty or if he could recite the alphabet. He tired quickly. He would protest against his heavy lids. "I can do a few more. I just want to stay awake." "You've spent a long time in a very deep coma, Mr. Drillard. Please, let us set the pace." There was a television in the hospital ward and the lady in the next bed over liked to keep it tuned to a popular situation comedy about a young urban professional called Ishtar is Your Oyster, Mona Farmer . Drillard wore a faraway, sad expression as he watched the sexy brunette starlet cavort on screen. Everyone else in the ward laughed uproariously at the dumb jokes. Physiotherapy was hard. "You need to find something to fight for," urged his therapist as Drillard was crumpled, panting, at the base of the treadmill. "You need to want to get back to your life." "My wife left me," he croaked forlornly. "When you're well again, you can meet somebody new." "I'm C-5." "There are plenty of C-5 women around. Not everybody wants to spend their life having babies, you know. What do you think you might want to do once you're up and at it again?" He grimaced, tasting the metal bar against his mouth. "I don't know." "You need a dream, Mr. Drillard. You can't strive without a dream." VI. Yasu was setting. The shadow of her giant rings cut through the swirls of cloud visible on her broad limb above the treetops. The sky beyond was purple and pinpricked with the evening's first stars, a chorus around Proxima. The opposite horizon burned golden as Centauri Prime rolled out of view. Birds chirped. Drillard sat on a bench, an intravenous bag hanging on a wheeled stand beside him. Orderlies were helping the other patients inside from the garden. Drillard awaited his turn, lazily watching streams of traffic clot and stretch over the city, the amber glow of Centauri Secundae lighting up the bellies of the clouds as it rose. A monk walked over and took a seat next to him. "Do you mind?" Drillard shook his head. "Feel free. You'll have the whole bench to yourself in a minute or two. The orderlies are coming to float me back to my room." "I wouldn't mind chatting in the meantime. You're Trenton Drillard, aren't you?" Drillard nodded. "That's me." The monk's brow was sloped with concern, his face etched by years of similar compassions. "My name is Brother Necker," he said. "I'm a Zorannite volunteer with the hospital. We haven't spoken before." Drillard shrugged. "I'm not really religious." The monk smiled carelessly. "No, I suppose you're not an observant man so far as that goes. But it is my understanding that you're experiencing a particularly religious predicament." "You've been misinformed. I was just in a coma." "And suffering persistent delusions of awakening, isn't that right?" Drillard conceded a nod. "Well, all but the last one were delusions, I guess. I'm here now, aren't I?" The monk shifted somewhat closer, leaning in. "Then you're altogether convinced that the process is complete? This reality --" he said, gesturing briefly at their darkening environs, "-- is the ultimate reality. Is that so?" Drillard hesitated. "I'm getting better," he said a bit more aggressively than he had planned. "The construct thinks I'm just a little shell-shocked from the experience of waking up out of the coma. Once burned, twice shy -- that kind of thing. The doctors say I'm doing great." Brother Necker sat back again, his eyes unfocused. "And yet you don't feel quite wholly yourself." "I'm getting better," said Drillard again. "But you have stopped fighting." "There's nothing to fight against. It's all been explained to me." The monk turned to him seriously, his wizened little face glowering with a new hint of menace. "In that satisfaction lies your doom, Mr. Drillard," he said, eyes fixed on eyes. Suddenly he blinked, sat back, and assumed his previous careless posture. He looked up at the sky. "Have you studied much history, Trenton?" "Nobody calls me Trenton," replied Drillard carefully, watching the monk. "No," he added after a moment. "I mean, not really. I'm just a traffic controller. What's this about doom?" Brother Necker gestured upward. The darkening quarter of the sky now admitted the brightest parts of the green and scarlet phantasm of gas every Ishtari knew so well. "Rome," he said, pointing out a streamer of fluorescing helium. "New York," he said, letting his finger trace sideways across the sky to settle on a patch of ink against a backdrop of glittering stars. "Paris. Every city of the ancient world, every road, every grave, every tree...spread out across the sky in dust." "Sure," grunted Drillard noncommitally. "Everybody knows all about the Solar Nebula." "Our race fled in the face of that calamity -- that you know well, too -- and it was just a single ark that reached this Second Earth. Of those that set out, only a single generation ship arrived." "Right," agreed Drillard. "What many people don't appreciate is that, after the accident -- after we were separated from the others -- a whole generation arose on our ark that was utterly ignorant of their situation. Can you imagine that? They consulted our oldest books and found facts described therein that had virtually no correlation to the reality in which they found themselves. They had to wonder why the ancestors thought things like 'the sky' were so important when there was evidently no such thing." Drillard shifted. "Disorienting." "Worse," said Brother Necker gravely. "It nearly drove them psychotic. Our history nearly ended right there and then. You see, a man cannot live when he has no trust in his world. Imagine waking yourself out of ignorance to find a source of knowledge which seems to contradict everything that seems reasonable until a further stage of awakening is achieved. So was for them: the wisdom of the ancestors made no sense until we made planetfall." Drillard frowned, then glanced over his shoulder to see if could spot an orderly. "What's your point?" The monk leaned in close again. "Clarity is seeking you," he said seriously. "You, in turn, must seek clarity. At that union all these bewildering fragments will assemble into a sensible whole, and wisdom will be yours. You can and must awaken to this truth, my son." Centauri Secundae had risen. Drillard studied the star absently, hearing the monk shift beside him. Finally he muttered, "So what would you have me do? Sacrifice a goat? Meditate under a baobab? Shelter orphans?" "Swim, my son. You must simply swim." And as he said this Drillard saw that the nebula above them was running and twisting with distortion as its light was filtered through the undulating surface of a sea. The stars, the clouds, the satellites -- of them seemed to be refracting down to him through a liquid sky. The city wavered like weeds on the ocean floor, and suddenly Drillard's lungs ached for air. He was floating. "We're having cherry gelatin tonight," said the orderly. But Drillard was far above him now, clawing and kicking his way through the thick aether toward the lights of heaven. He strained his fingertips toward the vault, desperate now to break the surface and breathe again. Upward, ever upward, Drillard surged toward the shining orb of Secundae... VII. With a start Drillard realized that he had failed to complete his mathematics homework. He looked up at the teacher and quailed inside, the taste of bile at the back of his throat. "Stand up, Mr. Drillard!" Drillard stood up. He felt cold. He looked down and saw, to his horror, that he was stark naked. All the other kids pointed and laughed. Drillard fell upon himself, folding in half to cover his genitals and avert his eyes. He tried to roll into a little ball where there on the waxed linoleum floor. He pressed his fists into his eyes and willed the world to melt away... "Trenton, dear, you'll be late for school." "But I'm already at school." He saw that he wasn't. He was in his bed beside Pauline, drawing little circles of tickle on her exposed hip as his mother busied herself about the bedroom, putting stuffed toys back on the shelf and hucking sports-themed underwear into the dirty laundry bin. "Honestly, this room is a sty." "Could you just give me a minute Mom, so I can have sex with Pauline one last time before the divorce?" "Of course dear, but please have a bit of breakfast first." She made spaceship sounds as she flew each spoonful of hot oatmeal into his mouth and then used the edge of the spoon to wipe away the excess. Drillard obediently opened for the next helping. Pauline exhaled loudly and rolled her eyes. "Just a sec, honey," he mumbled around his food. "I'm almost done here." "You're no pioneer," sneered Pauline. "There's no ceiling on what I can be, Polly." "You can't be a father." "No, not to children. I guess not. But maybe to something else. People like me begin new histories, you know." He was distracted by the fat, thick-lipped man sitting on the end of the bed. His hands looked like a child's hands -- pink and soft and tiny. He adjusted his tie with those tiny hands then cleared his phlegm. "The process is completely safe, Mr. Drillard, let me assure you. Modern hibernation techniques ensure a senseless journey and an easy transition back to consciousness upon arrival at your destination. Failing a major breakthrough in propulsion, hibernation really is the only viable option for making an interplanetary trip of this magnitude." "Has it ever gone wrong?" asked Drillard, pushing aside his mother's hand. "Have you ever lost anyone?" The fat man bit his own plump lip. "I must be frank with you, Mr. Drillard: just under one tenth of one percent of hibernators may experience a challenging wake." Drillard cocked his head as he stroked his ex-wife's hip. "What's that mean?" "There have been cases -- rare cases, isolated cases -- in which a very small number of hibernators have descended into a steady-state of extreme sleep reluctant to re-admit reality when the time comes. It may be a defense mechanism against neurological injury, real or perceived, not entirely unlike a coma. I must emphasize again, however, that such cases are exceedingly few and far between." "But what happens to them?" "We have several interventions at our disposal to aid the recovery." "Like what?" The fat man suddenly seized Drillard by the face and pulled him bodily across the bed, then shouted, "Wake up!" with spittle-flecked vehemence. VIII. Drillard awoke. He sat up and puked. White robots were at his side in an instant, the pads of their fingers soft and warm. "Please lie down," said one in a melodiously sexless contralto as it wiped strings of yellow bile from his lips. "Please do not resist," said the other, pushing him back into the pillows. "Focus on slowing your breathing, Passenger Drillard. In...and out. In...and out." Drillard turned his head. He saw an intravenous drip attached to his arm. Beyond that his eyes could not focus well -- blearily he could discern row after row of hibernation capsules. Those closest to him were splayed open like spring flowers; those further away were in the process of slowly opening. Hundreds of white robots tended to the dazed cargo, their calming voices blending into a comforting drone. A human physician stepped up beside him and checked the readouts. The badge on her white coat identified her as Dr. Sen. She took a little flashlight out of her pocket and pointed it into each of his eyes in turn. "How are you feeling, Mr. Drillard?" she asked, clicking the flashlight off with her thumb. Drillard blinked. "Dreams," he said, voice husky. And then, "How...long?" Dr. Sen nodded. "Perfectly normal. You've been in hibernation for nearly seventeen years." He managed to just barely shake his head, the pillow rustling in his ears. "No -- how long...have I been waking up?" She glanced up at his capsule's readout again, then shot a cuff and checked her watch. "Um, we started the wake routine about, let's see, an hour ago." "An hour? But I was back on Ishtar -- there were days... weeks. I kept trying to wake up. All of it...only one hour?" She offered him a tight, professional smile and patted him on the shoulder. "Give yourself a few minutes before you stand up, Mr. Drillard. You're doing great." Later he loitered in the lounge, his bum peeking out the back of his hibernation gown as he sipped orange juice from a plastic cup while staring past his own reflection out the floor-to-ceiling windows. The wheel of the galaxy cut the view. Off to one side Centauri Secundae blazed, and directly ahead was a pale blue crescent standing bright against the bed of stars and smoke. Another planet. A new world. His future home. He cried. He didn't feel embarrassed -- a fair number of the stunned and largely silent collection of fellow passengers in the lounge were sobbing, too. Some of them hugged robots. The robots patted them gently on the back. "There there," they cooed. "there there, passenger." When he had gathered himself somewhat Drillard signalled for service. A robot was at his side in seconds. Drillard cleared his throat. "Coffee." The robot cocked its head. "Sir?" "You heard me," he snapped, turning to look into the thing's insensible glowing eyes. "Coffee, strong, black." "Caffeine is contraindicated, passenger. Rest is recommended." "Rest? You've got to be kidding me," chuckled Drillard. He turned back to face space. "I'm never going to sleep again." Browse the complete story library at Cheeseburger Brown.com !

Alternative Formats: Kindle | iPad Connected Stories: Robots Bury the Dead , Stubborn Town And now, the complete tale: I. Cancer calmed Cabot. His physician frowned. "Would you like me to put you in touch with a counsellor?" Cabot scoffed. "Hell no," he said; "haven't felt so relieved in years." The doctor raised his brow so Cabot explained: "Living while your body falls apart under you leaves a man never knowing which way is up. Dying, on the other hand -- dying I can understand. It may be bad news but it least it's got a direction." He took inventory. He did the paperwork. He had appointments at the banker's and the lawyer's, and he kept them both, making sure each of his no good grandchildren would get a little something to fritter away. His kids flew out to visit, cried, made nuisances of themselves, finally went back home to their so goddamn important jobs -- jobs doing things they never seemed very capable of explaining to Cabot. Computer this or Internet that, banking for lawyers or a lawyer to bankers, busy and brusque and tired. "They gave me six months," he said to his barber at the seven month mark. By eight months he started getting restless. He sat on his porch, turning a cold pipe over in his weathered hands. The Appalachians were blue in the south. A hundred kinds of bug and bird were chittering. The air smelled like laurel and mud. The underbellies of the clouds were pink, remembering the recent dawn. "Shit," said Cabot, because the moment was so beautiful he wished it could be his to die in. Instead, with considerably less poetry, he would probably end up giving it up while watching the hockey game. Or on the john. He grimaced. That'd be no good. There were no choices left for Cabot to make; he had become an observer in his own life, a fan sitting in the bleachers rooting listlessly for some kind of conclusion. His situation was static. He was too Christian to hasten the hand of fate, but not Christian enough, he reckoned, to just sit and wait for it like a statue made of meat. He knocked his pipe, squished in a plug of tobacco, struck a match and closed his eyes. Thinking. His next visitors more likely than not would be Mounties coming to check up on his silence. They'd come out of the house to escape the smell, one foot perched inside t
One of my former students just introduced me to the "Lip Dub" phenomenon, in which various school communities do an entire music video in one long carefully choreographed shot (see my previous post about my desire to assign the students a single shot video). In addition to the challenge of choreographing this correctly, and coming up with neat ways to use the camera, it seems like an excellent way of bringing the whole school community together in a way that celebrates various aspects of school life. This is the video that Kai sent me, it stands out among the Lip Dubs as it was filmed backwards - similar to Spike Jonze's music video Drop for the Pharcyde, but again... all in one shot: Searching for LipDub on YouTube produces quite a few results, with some really neat ideas and interpretations of the project (as well as some lousy ones... hey, it is YouTube). No, how to get the whole school together for a few hours though... now there's an even bigger challenge... Thanks Kai! Thanks Joe! If you're a fan of the still-amazing-25-years-later Rube Goldbergian feat of The Way Things Go , you'll be amazed by This Too Shall pass. In fact, it would be pretty hard not to be impressed by this four minute single-shot music video; its not just the amazing contraption, but the choreography of camera, the machine, and the actors, all moving together in harmony. In addition to all the obvious amazingness about the video, I especially love that the process is the product . To me, this video really celebrates the act of artistic creation. ...and its a catchy tune. Here's the Wired article about the making of the video. Thanks for the link, Ben! One of my very talented former students sent me some great links that are perfect for any IB Film or Media Lit class. Well, the Lars Von Treier one might not be perfect for your classroom. In fact, you might want to make sure its appropriate before sharing it with the students. One project that I've done in the past is to have the students create videos in the style of famous directors. These would be perfect examples. Wes Anderson's Spiderman: I love the way they mimic both Anderson's deadpans and camera pans. Lars Von Triere's Denmark Tourism Ads: Thanks for those, Travis! We've got a new agenda in IB Film today! Finally, I stumbled across this article , that celebrates the art of cinematography with written descriptions of techniques, and visuals pulled from YouTube. Its a really excellent explanation of the art, and a great introduction to film language. If you're working on either the Rotoball 2010 or Paint the World with Light projects, our deadline is next Monday, March 1st! If you are a participant, and haven't received an email with instructions for uploading from me, please send me an email or leave a comment here. I've been fortunate to get a sneak preview of some of the projects that some of you have been working on, and let me just say this in advance: wow. In January 2009, I posted my favorite iTouch/iPhone apps for use in the art classroom . Since then, I've found several new apps to be incredibly useful and engaging for the students in a number of different ways. Note: I have deliberately not included any iPhone apps that require use of the camera. Although some of these products look fantastic, I don't have an iPhone, and thus can't rate them. The apps listed below are free, or a few dollars at most. One of the most useful tools I've found is Air Mouse Pro . This allows me to turn my iTouch into a remote control for my computer- complete with a trackpad and mini keyboard. Mostly, I use it for presentations; it frees me to walk around the class during class discussions and demonstrations. However, anything you can do on your computer, you can now do from anywhere in the class. This works much better and is a huge improvement over Remote Pad , which I had recommended last year. The Oblique Strategies is a digital version of Brian Eno's card stack for overcoming creative blocks. Simple and universally applicable phrases help you think of ways to approach your projects in new ways. When I've been discussing ideas with my students, I've occasionally pulled out the Oblique Strategies to help them dig deeper into their ideas. Sometimes it falls flat, but sometimes it provides an eerily helpful perspective. An alternative to this is an app called Methodology which is basically the same thing (and might even be a rip-off of the Oblique Strategies, but the one advantage to it, is that it randomizes the card stack responses. Yet another version of this is the Creative Whack Pack. This has a nice design and explanation of the suggestions it makes, but overall hasn't generated as interesting responses for my classes as the Oblique Strategies has. The suggestions are more general ways to think creatively. Do you have any projects that include storytelling? The Idea Generator (mentioned here before) also has an itouch app, great for coming up with writing prompts. This has worked very well with my film and video classes. There is also a Movie Idea Generator , but I've found the suggestions here too convoluted to be developed into workable ideas. Although Brushes is David Hockney's painting app of choice, I've found that Autodesk's Sketchbook to be a much more intuitive program and easier to manipulate. Similarly, Layers has an interface like Brushes , but has a great visualization for looking at layers as stacked glass slides. This is a fantastic way of helping students understand how layers work in programs like Photoshop, Flash, or Final Cut. If you can't get enough of painting programs, Asian Painting is also a neat app. The interface is made to resemble an ancient calligraphy desk, and the brushes all fade appropriately. If you are participating in our Paint the World with Light project, then Light Painting is a must have app. This app allows you to flash different colors at different speeds, or simply create a constant colored light brush. Also for photographers, DOFMaster allows you to quickly check your depth of field range for an SLR or DSLR camera. For film students, Grat's Slate is a great application that turns your iTouch into a movie clap board. Even though syncing sound and image might not be critical for us (since we mostly record both onto the same digital media now), this is a great way to organize your shots and easily identify your takes in post production. Plus, it makes your students film shoots seem more professional. Although there are too many Museum Apps to mention now, its worth downloading these, especially if you're planning a visit. For example, the Brooklyn Museum's app allows you to find basic information about its collection. Who knows what goodies can be found in the apps for the museums in your neighborhood? Finally, I feel compelled to not recommend Photoshop Mobile, because of my extreme disappointment. This application bears nothing that resembles Photoshop except in name. As a film teacher (or probably more relevantly, a film geek), I watch just about as many films as I can. I often mean to include suggestions of films to watch in class here (including a constantly changing list of films about artists that every art class should have). Long story short- I was reading an interview with Danny Boyle when he came here to host the Shanghai International Film Festival last year. In response to a question about his favorite Chinese film, he mentioned Devils on the Doorstep as one of the best films to come out of China. I'd never heard of it, but as the serendipity gods are always looking out for me, I happened to spot it at one of my favorite DVD stores just a day or two after I'd read the interview. Then it sat on my shelf for a few months. I just got around to watching it recently, and I have to say that its one of the best films I've ever seen. Its also one of the most surprising films I've ever seen. The movie that you end with is so far from the movie that you started with, that its an incredible feat of creativity and vision that the director is able to pull of such a transition. The hard thing about recommending a film like this is that I can't say too much about it- what you will appreciate most about this film is the unexpected directions that it takes. That being said, understand that it is not for the faint hearted; taking place during the Japanese occupation of China, this film does quite graphically depict some of the horrors of war. That being said, it is a fascinating film from a cinematic perspective, as well as a historical and contemporary socio-cultural perspective. Director Jiang Wen has been banned from making any more movies in China. Although he is married to a French woman and can work outside of China, he refuses. His stories, he says, take place in China, and that's where they are meant to be filmed and shown. A Rant The other day, I was catching up on some of my news podcasts which are always a day or two late for me (hey, how'd that election in Massachusetts turn out)? One of my favorite podcasts is NPR's On Point with Tom Ashbrook , but my one big beef with his show is that in the interest of being 'fair and balanced' (now there's a loaded phrase), he often lets some pretty nutty folks say some pretty nutty things without too much challenge. I often wonder if they do this simply to prove that they don't have a liberal bias-. The show I was listening to recently was one of those shows. In an episode titled "Where the Web Went Wrong", author Jaron Lanier was on the show promoting his book " You Art Not A Gadget --", the central thesis of this is that participatory communities online create a 'hive mind' in which we are sacrificing our creative energies in the service of companies to which we owe nothing. In this discussion, he lambasts 'Web 2.0 proponents' as religious cultists who contribute their time and energy, not for their own personal gain, but in the interest of creating a god-like singularity of utopian participation. To me, this argument reeks of the conservative fear of the commons. I like to share my thoughts about art education with the greater community for my own personal interest, and all of a sudden I'm handing out flowers at airports and promoting a socialist agenda. Well, I do live in China, after all. I can see how that could be confusing to some. While some of the points that Lanier makes are just plain wrong and some just plain silly (and quite often both), some fall into the realm of the "wha...?" One of his most awkward points is that people feel free to "mash up" the creative efforts of others, but that the ads that regularly appear on the sides of the webpages that these mashups appear are somehow sacrosanct, and 'above' being modified for creative use. This idea is based on two false premises: (1) That ads are not mashed because we hold them with some sort of respect, and (b) there is anything useful in these ads to 'mash'. Sidebar ads aren't seen as 'holy', they aren't even seen as 'useful' for a creative endeavor. At most, I'd say they were seen as a minor inconvenience or annoyance. In fact, I'd argue that they aren't even seen at all . I don't have ads on this site and if you think back to the last site you were on, what were the ads for? Do you remember? I don't either. Further, it shows a fundimental misunderstanding about the purpose of a mashup, which is to celebrate or satirize the derivative work in a way that creates something that we haven't seen before. With a nod to the serendipity gods, I happened to find this wonderful Mashup of the movie UP over on the always fascinating Learning IT on the same day that I listened to this podcast. I could just listen to that song all day. If there is any doubt in your mind that mash-ups are somehow by definition 'less creative' than their derivative works, this video should dispel that notion. It also should dispel the notion that the creation of projects like this one are in service to some corporate monolith that feeds off of our creative juices. Pogo , the 21 year old creator of this mash up is now being wooed by corporations to make Mashup videos for them... the one above was commissioned by Pixar itself. That is not to say that the commissioning of a work validates it above other creative works. Lanier is right in one way- that we should be compensated for our creative efforts and hard work. However, he is mistaken in thinking that everything that we do needs financial compensation. If before the internet, the quiet creative endeavors that we pursued resulted in only our own satisfaction, that was compensation enough. Now that everyone has the ability and opportunity to share the processes and products of our creative expression doesn't mean we all need to get a paycheck for everything we do. "Web 2.0" (or whatever you want to call it) isn't where the web went wrong , its where the web went right . Before the concept of participatory media overtook online activity, the internet's main purpose was another in a long line of the one-to-many forms of media (h/t to Howard Rheingold) following radio, TV, and movies. Before web 2.0 tools put content creation in the hands of the masses, what was the internet? A place to buy all kinds of stuff and occasionally get entertained. So basically, it was the mall... Without all the walking. And that was just what we all needed, wasn't it? More shopping, less exercise. -Good luck with that, Tom. --Yeah, no. I'm not going to promote it here. You can find it with the google.
This morning, I had two interesting thoughts. The first pertains to a remark I heard by a coworker 13 years ago. “If heaven is real,” she said, “I don’t want to go there. It would be boring.” This morning, I had a thought that, given that God is omnipotent, the possibilities for heaven are limitless. Specifically, one could conceive that each room in the kingdom of heaven might be its own universe , with its own space, its own galaxies, its own planets, its own flora and fauna. Maybe not exactly like that, but that’s one possibility that shows what an amazing and interesting place it will be. No, Sarah, heaven will not be boring. The second thought was about the idea of multiple universes that is currently fashionable. If there are other universes, can one universe visit the inhabitants of another universe? Probably not, which is sad. But , perhaps we will see each other in the kingdom of heaven? That is another reason why heaven will not be boring. Today I take up as my life's mission the following phrase from The Imitation of Christ, Book II, Chapter 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare a worthy dwelling for Christ in my heart. This philosophy is applicable to any state in life. We take whatever comes our way, and use it to prepare our hearts as a dwelling for Christ. If there is trouble in the family, or at work, or in friendship, we treat it as a sharing in the suffering of Christ. When we see others better off than us, we do not envy them, having forsaken the riches of the world, to prepare our hearts for Christ. If we are ill and confined to a bed for the remainder of our years, we use the time profitably in prayer, to prepare our hearts to receive Christ. In this way we attain peace in times of prosperity and in times of affliction. Pope Benedict XVI: "Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you to find in this Lenten Season prolonged moments of silence, possibly in retreat, in order to review your own lives in the light of the loving plan of the heavenly Father." Angelus: Second Sunday of Lent, 8 March (1st Sunday of Lent, St. Andrew's Cathedral, Victoria BC) Rainbow as announcement of God's mercy: Even if man falls into sin, God will not destroy the earth. Christ fulfills this covenant. Harrowing of Hell: purgatory. Another sign of mercy. Baptism more than ritual: a sacrament of mercy, through which we are saved. Also a gift of holiness, as it unites us to God. Also, a task to live in a way befitting this gift. Temptation is especially strong in times of holiness, such as the Lenten season. We must persevere. Realize the love and forgiveness of Christ. Spread the joy of Christ. Went to Confession today, and Father Benoit ended with, &quot;God bless you, and be happy.&quot; Will do!

OFFICIAL RESULTS 1 Dayron ROBLES CUB 7.34 CR 2 Terrence TRAMMELL USA 7.36 NR 3 David OLIVER USA 7.44 PB 4 Evgeniy BORISOV RUS 7.51 SB 5 Petr SVOBODA CZE 7.58 6 Maurice WIGNALL JAM 7.60 SB 7 Xiang LIU CHN 7.65 SB 8 Dániel KISS HUN 7.81 I went out in the final of the World Indoor Championships and ran 60 meters worth of hurdles faster than I had ever run before! I stopped the clock at 7.44, good enough for the bronze medal, behind a new championship record from Dayron Robles who ran 7.34 for gold and Terrence Trammel, who finished in silver with an American record of 7.36. To backtrack, I did not run very well in my semi final heat, finishing second in 7.61. I made a few mistakes, especially at the start. I wasn't too upset or anything because the bottom line is you have to survive and advance through the rounds. By finishing second, I grabbed an automatic spot to the final. After going back to the warm up area, Brooks and I had the chance to work out a few things that went wrong with my trigger hand out of the blocks. It was sweeping back aggressively, but I wouldn't bring it back through, so that was the point of emphasis in the 45 minutes I had before the final. Having your coach or at least another set of well trained eyes is so priceless at major competitions like this. So due to my lackluster semi final performance, I drew lane eight. Going in to the final I was so relaxed. My focus was to try to beat Liu to the first hurdle and just run like hell for the final four because I would be out there racing by myself. I feel like I had a good start and I ended up running a clean race. I can't wait to re watch the race. One thing that I knew I had on my side was the fact that my second race is ALWAYS better than my first of the day. I knew only a few others in the race have displayed that ability in the past and the comparison of our times from the semi final to the final display just that. Robles dropped .22 (7.56-7.34), Terrence .15 (7.51-7.36) and myself .17 (7.61-7.44). Everyone else in the field so minor improvement. Winning this medal was so sweet! Coming off the devastating injury last year, not doing block starts or heavy hurdling until two weeks before my race in Glasgow to coming out and winning an indoor medal and running a personal best. I couldn't have asked for more. We have a saying that all indoors can do is show you where outdoors is at, and I'm feeling majorly confident that this will be a GREAT outdoor season! People who know the event of hurdling, know that what I do indoor definitely reflects well on what I am capable of doing outdoor because I am a last five hurdle guy, not a starter. I'm so ready to get outdoor season poppin'!! First round action from all five preliminary heats The first round went as me and Brooks planned. The objective for this round was to attack the first two hurdles and then just take it easy after that. My start was much better than it has been lately and I led from start to finish and stopped the clock at 7.60, equal fastest time of all runners today, Terrance Trammel also ran 7.60 in his heat. I felt very good, the warm up was great and I felt so much more relaxed and loose here as opposed to when I ran in New Mexico, I think I was kind of tight for that competition. Ron Forbes was in my heat, he lived and trained with me for the '08-'09 season before moving back to Miami, it's good seeing him still competing, he also made it to the next round. People seem to be counting me out in this competition, as they seem to believe it is just a three man race between Trammel, Robles and Liu Xiang, rightfully so, but I guess that's why we run the races and I hope to have a say in it before it all is said and done. I know I am a much better outdoor hurdler than an indoor one, but as long as we aren't doing starts to the first hurdle to decide the medals, I feel I have as good a chance as anyone to claim one of them! I am off until the semi-finals on Sunday afternoon, the finals will be two hours after the semis. I am in the third and final heat. Until then, I will keep my eyes on the prize!!! My training partner Novlene Williams-Mills made it to the final of the 400 which will be tomorrow afternoon. The schedule called for them to run prelims and semi-finals today! She ran 51.7 and has the second fastest time going to the finals, she'll definitely do well tomorrow! As I type this post, it is a little after 10pm local time, an eight hour time difference from the cozy confines of the first house on Emerald Green Ct. My body is almost in shut down mode. The internet is pretty spotty in our apartments, but nonetheless, I got some action! The downside is that I don't know how much of my Slingbox I will be able to watch while out here, so I am going to be WAY out of the loop. Constant Blackberry messages to Aub will keep me slightly up to date. I left home Sunday at 4:30 and arrived here in Doha at 7pm Monday evening. Most of the U.S. team arrived here last Thursday, I felt that ten days ahead of the final was far too much time to be in this environment personally. I would have been here stir crazy, plus I know my personal countdown, seeing that this is the fourth year I have made the trip out here to Doha to compete in some capacity. Usually I would get here on Monday night and have to race Wednesday night. With that in mind, I have produced times of 13.14, 13.09 and 12.95 outdoors with that schedule. Granted this is a championship, but I try to treat every meet just like it's a regular competition, no need in trying to reinvent the wheel right? I travel well so I'll be fine. The athletes village they have here is the best village I've been in out of all the team I made. We are in apartments, high jumper Jesse Williams is my roommate here, feels funny because this is the first team I've been on without my boy Kenta Bell. The facilities are great here, real state of the art. The amazing thing is that gas cost 33 cents a gallon! I really need to fill up a couple of barrels and bring them back with me to the States!! My first round goes off on Friday afternoon, I'm feeling great and ready to compete. I will have a pre race update before we go off. Things out in Albuquerque went as planned. I finished second in my hurdle race behind Terrence Trammell who ran a world leading time of 7.41. That finish qualified me for the World Indoor Championships in Doha, my fourth World Championship/Olympic team qualification. I still get amazed at the accomplishments I have made in my track and field career. I would have never believed all this would come about when I was in college, with no aspirations of doing anything track related as a career. I guess I had a string of second place finishes throughout the weekend. Second fastest prelim time, second fastest semi-final time and a second place finish. I would have loved to get the win, but at the end of the day, whether you finish first or second, the wheels of the plane will touch down at Doha International Airport at the same time. In the finals, I feel like I ran probably the best set of hurdles I've run indoors ever. I was still coming up to set when the gun went off which caught me off guard a bit and caused my start to be even worse than it usually is. I did a good job keeping my composure and made up a lot of ground and did what I had to do to make that team! I was very impressed with my lead leg action. I did not run my best race but I still had my fifth best performance indoors time wise. I was joking with Brooks, saying that my race would have been a hell of an outdoor one! My coach has a philosophy which I have fully bought in to. If you have a great race, you're challenging the world record, if you have a good race, you win, if you have a bad race, you still make the podium/team and that's what happened this time. Race video I've been out here in Albuquerque, New Mexico for a couple of days now. I've done a few press conferences and interviews since I've been out here. I didn't have the opportunity to go and talk to the local kids with the Win With Integrity Program unfortunately. That's something I look forward to doing when I come to the meets in the States, but I'll have another opportunity soon. My mom and Harold made the six hour drive down from Denver and my boys Kelvin and Murph flew down too. I'm excited to be back at a National Championship event, I miss both the indoor and outdoor championships in 2009. I love the competition that USA Nationals brings out of every competitor. I have one race this afternoon, and two on Sunday. This event is our qualification for the World Indoor Championships in Doha, Qatar that will be hosted March 12-14. The top two in each event make the team. Me and Valeria will open up at 3:30 mountain time, in heat one of three. We'll be starting in lane five. I've found myself a breast cancer wristband with the word strength on it, couldn't have found a better word. I'll be racing in it. This is a video that was played in the area on the news from the press conference. I will update the blog after the first round, hopefully everything goes as to plan! As one of many athletes that is accessible through many social websites such as twitter, Facebook and my blog, I am never sure what type of messages I may receive. Most are of the congratulatory type or words of encouragement, you get a few that are negative and some that are indecent and lewd to say the least. While checking my messages on Facebook, I came across a message titled "When You Run". I open it up, not really knowing what it may be about, then I read: Dear David, thank you for been an inspiration for many young and old people like me :) I never met you, and likely never will, but I have a favor to ask you. My life, as i know it, has changed since last month. I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and now as a sequel of my surgery I will not be able to be as active as I used to be. I miss the outdoor, the hiking, the cycling...but such is life. One day, when you run will you think of me? so that for that one day I will be running too :) Thank you Valeria When I finished reading these few sentences, I felt a wave of different emotions. I felt sorry because Valeria is going through a life changing event. I felt proud because she viewed me as being an inspiration, that in turn changed my feeling of being sorry for her, in to that of being in awe of her strength. I felt surprised that she would think of me out of all of the people to ask to fulfill her very simple request. Most of all, I felt an elevated sense of responsibility. That feeling came from me sitting back and realizing that we as public figures (i.e. athletes, entertainers etc) no matter how minor or how major have an responsibility, whether we like it or not, to the masses. When I go out and run a race, which is very minor in the grand scheme of life, the way that I present myself and act on and off the track, somebody is watching me. I may not be a big time NFL or NBA star or even a Usain Bolt in my sport, but I realize that I have a lot of fans and am viewed as sort of an inspiration to them in one way or another and I do not want to jeopardize that. I responded back to Valeria with this: Thank you for viewing me as an inspiration to people. I try to carry and handle myself in that position as well. I have no problem with running for you! I am competing at the USA Indoor Championships in New Mexico and I will definitely run for you there!! Keep in contact with me and I hope things turn around for you so that you will be able to get back to the active lifestyle you enjoyed! So, I will be doing just that! My races that I am blessed to run out in Albuquerque, New Mexico will be run for Ms. Valeria Pagnon and I will find a pink breast cancer wrist band to wear in her honor! I appreciate her for making me aware of the unique situation that I am in as well.
Despite his injuries, Albin outlived all his brothers and was one of the last surviviors of the regiment. He died in Orwigsburg at the age of 88 on July 30, 1930, coincidentally enough, the 66th Anniversary of the Explosion of the Petersburg Mine and the Battle of the Crater.Several days after his July 1864 wounding at Petersburg, and from a hospital bed in the rear of the lines, Albin penned a letter to his brother Henry in Orwigsburg. It is a rather interesting account of his wound and the fact that he mentions the digging of the Mine makes this a rather unique letter.Camp Battel of pettersBurg, virginiaJuly 10 1864Dear BrotherI now sit Down to write A Few lines to let you know that I am well At present and hope to find you the same.

Hard-Working, Humble, Passionate person who Loves food and is willing to do anything to learn! Gchef703 @ linecook you should not Be a Pre Madonna!!! Should not be late, ask for days off, breaks or a special jacket to show off to your friends Gchef703 @ linecook you should Be a Sponge Listen! Learn! and ask a million questions even if they are stupid questions. ask em! You're about to explode.  There's too far too much blood and oxygen coursing through your veins, and your eyes your pupils are so dialated that they would catch the attention of any police officer you came across.  You just finished your stage, and it went so beautifully that you're too wound up to eat, or drink, or even talk about it.  This is one of those perfectly fleeting moments, so you just sit there on the bus, missing your stop, so you can soak it all up.  You start Tuesday as the new fish cook.  Unless: You blew it.  It seemed like your stage was going ok, but right around the end of the first turn the sous told you that you could take off.  You considered protesting, but instead you decided to change, have a smoke and get a bite to eat.  Sitting down at the bar, you order your food and a drink, and sometime later the chef tells you that you're welcome back anytime...but no job is discussed.  And you dont ask about one.  Your stage is over, and you wasted it.  So how did this happen? Prep: You went into the restaurant between lunch and dinner service dressed appropriately, resume and knives in hand.  For a week you've been reading the menu on-line, and bringing yourself up to speed on the background of the chef and the restaurant itself.  After your chat with the chef, you let him know that you're ready to stage that evening if he would like.  He tells you to come back Friday instead.  On Friday you show up early, smiling and introducing yourself to any staff that you come across.  You take your knives and a spoon out of your kit that you slimmed down a bit, and settle in with any prep work that they'll give you--herb picking, cutting bread, citrus supremes.  You work quietly and cleanly, with eyes and ears open so you dont miss a thing.  Unless: You drop into the restaurant as you walk by, and approach the chef who is expediting a fairly busy lunch service.  He doesn't have time to talk to you right now, but tells you to come back that evening at 4 for a stage.  You tell him that you have tickets to a show, but could you come in tomorrow?  He asks for a resume.  You dont have it with you.  When you do show up for your stage, the chef asks you why you want to work in his restaurant; what is it about this place, this food, that turns you on?  You stumble through some bullshit answers.  He smirks at you.  Unpacking your kit you pull out 6 knives, a spatula, tongs, and a handful of spoons.  The sous steps in next to you. "Um.  What's all that shit for?" Working through your prep, you dont shut up--about your last job, your opinions on how things should be done, and who you think should win top chef.  No one really responds to you, but you go on anyways.  Service: The chef had told you that he needed a fish cook, so this is the station that you stick with through prep, line-up, and into service.  During line up you politely ask if you can taste mise, and as you taste dishes you take notes, and try to memorize the station set-up.  Just before service you sweep the station and wipe down everything for the cook.  You ask the chef if he wants you anywhere else during service, but he says no.  During service you pull plates, and garnish, but generally try to stay out of the way and observe.  Eventually the pace starts to build a bit, and the cook catches your eye. "Alright.  We're going on 7 fish and 6 scallops.  We'll go together, ok?  You take the scallop dish." An hour later you're cooking all of the proteins on your own, with the fish cook plating and garnishing for you.  When the sous asks how it's all going for you, you tell him you love it, and want to close the station that night.  There will be no end of shift meal or drink for you.  Just a cold family meal, a watery iced tea, and a nod of approval from the brigade.  Unless: You bounce around the kitchen getting all up in everyones shit, but not really absorbing anything.  You taste without asking, and more than once you criticize the food.  During one of your rants about how you used to do it at your last job, the grill cook catches looks at you and growls "Well that's so fucking interesting."  Most of your evening is spent leaning against the ice machine, and when you do step in, you're so fucking slow wiping plates and garnishing that the sous knocks the chervil out of your hand and shouts "JUST FUCKING SEND IT!"  You cook zero orders, and when you sit down to eat at the bar, you order an expensive cocktail, and dont tip.  You.  Fucking.  Blew.  It. There is nothing like a stage in any other field of work.  Sure, athletes have tryouts, and actors have auditions.  A stage is both.  It lasts many hours, is physically and mentally draining, and everyone is already expecting you to fail before you even begin.  It's the culinary equivalent of  getting jumped into a gang.  You get one chance to get it right, and being thrust into an unfamiliar, borderline hostile environment guarantees that if you don't fail outright, you are at very least probably going to make a stupid mistake. And at the end of your stage, it's all of this pressure that makes succeeding all the more sweet.  To have cooked well, and won over the cooks that let you into their home is a special thing.  It's a re-affirming rite of passage, and a fleeting feeling you only get to enjoy every once in a while.  Don't let your stage just pass on by. notes . that's not bechamel. holy shit!  I updated finally! podcasts are coming back.  no really.  they are. get some rest. burrito stepping into an open grease trap means youll probably need new shoes. that's pasta water.  not a deep fryer. fish &amp; farm seems like its becoming the new industry night off spot Quotes and Conversations.

(I pinch Eddie's nipple.) Eddie :  Hey dude!  Not the nipples! Me :  Oh, im gonna get the nipples. Eddie :  ( pause )  I'm...ticklish. Me :  You can call him a pussy if you want to.

Me :  Graceful.  You're a real pageant queen. Merrell :  I'm a fuckin lady. from top:  sautee, line up, al, a gift from ryan farr, mer-mer's balls, where am i vol. 6, fuck you in your ear, super bowl, you figure it out Would you rather work with someone that was fast but a completely out of control, or a person that was slower but composed and in control? CookhouseSF @ linecook As one of the latter I'd like to work with the former KellyNg1 @ linecook i would take slower over sloppy anyday. seems easier to speed up a nice slow snail than to tame a rabid slob. KyleCWilkinson @ linecook Fast and out of control. Would balance my slower and more composed workstyle. theNeilD @ linecook What about fast and composed with poise; that's true talent. Those are the people that make you better. aphexplotz @ linecook Slow and composed. I've worked with both, and I'd rather be down one than have someone I can't predict or control. rupski23 @ linecook composed and in control. no question about it. the kitchen is crazy enough that if your leader is spazzing then its gonna be bad.. FattedCalf @ linecook Composed. Definitely composed. In my experience, people who go too fast and don't think can really put a banana in the tailpipe. tournant @ linecook slow/in control, for sure. fast/out of control=messy, doesn't listen, takes shortcuts GuyArnone @ linecook fast&amp;out of control = slow for the extra time spent fixing Speedy's mistakes. gardenstatechef @ linecook what's the end product? give me speed and insanity if the plates are perfect. jesachrist @ linecook slower and controlled. Working too fast creates more problems than it solves, and in the long run slows down everyone most_impressive @ linecook Slower, but in control. Speed can be taught, but accuracy and commitment to perfection is more valuable, IMO. TheNPA @ linecook All headway gained by being fast is lost in the ER while the Doc stitches Speedy Gonzales back up. MatthewSievert @ linecook in it to win it baby. Planning will allow for swift execution. cookerguy @ linecook Slower and composed, just not too slow. Fast and out of control disrupts others as well. ingridc @ linecook If I had to choose I'd go door #2. Out of control cook drags the whole ship down w/ them. Slow affects the line too, but less so. ingridc @ linecook (and for the record I've been both quite enough, thanks!) Benjamin_Parks @ linecook Slower but in control. Chaos always creates more work (cleaning, fixing, etc), so quick chaos just produces more work faster. cnewton9 @ linecook neither, I always try to teach the kids that efficiency=speed vs accuracy, fast but sloppy no good, slow but perfect also no bueno Gchef703 @ linecook Slow,Composed and in control FTW! They can always gain speed later. But sometimes speed is what you need! good question. stresscake @ linecook absolutely slow composed and in control. Frenzy causes stressful miserable work environment. Calmness is more productive over LT Jerry: It's looking like a slow Tuesday night, and the cooks are coasting through their prep period, all laughs and smiles. There's a lightness in the air, and there are plans being made for days off. A special family meal is on the stove, and reggae plays on the dining room sound system. Everyone is a quiet shadow of their usual kitchen self. Except for Jerry. Jerry has his headphones in, playing Pantera so loudly that the cooks across the kitchen can hear it. He bounces around nervously, and just before service he jumps around and rolls his head like a boxer getting ready for a fight. The kitchen will do 135 covers tonight. Jerry will treat it like he just defeated the Roman army. Denise: The first thing Denise does when she comes in is crack a joke and say hello to everyone in the kitchen. She'll breeze through prep with a smile on her face. Then when things get busy on the second turn, she will completely lose her shit. There will be muttering under her breath, mise slammed around, and a constantly shaking head--like each order on her station is a personal insult to her mother. Denise will stop calling back tickets completely, until things escalate with her sous chef to the point of yelling and him kicking her off the station. Nights like this will happen at least once a week. Mark: Mark is the first cook to show up for work, every day. He sets up his station meticulously. There will not be a single detail missed, and he will be almost invisible while he works. There is a quiet dignity to him during this time. Then when service starts he start acting like someone has taped a live grenade to his back. There will be dips and dives and spins and some of the most violent movement you have ever seen. The other cooks will be watching him out of the corners of their eyes. At best, he will end up exhausting the entire kitchen. Jen: Jen is like a warm blanket; when she is next to you on the line, you feel comforted...happy. She helps quietly, cooks with dignity, and maintains a level of composure far beyond her years of experience on the line. She never raises her voice, or flails, or loses her temper. Her movements are so fluid they appear slow--yet she's always setting the pace for the other cooks. Sitting with her, eating family meal, you ask her how she does it. "It's just food, right? Why panic? I'm not doing open chest surgery or anything." Composure. It's what separates good cooks from great ones. It's that quality that causes a guest to sit and watch, transfixed by the grace and elegance of a dinner service. It's certainly not the most important quality for a cook to have...but it's something that kitchen lifers immediately recognize and come to respect in their peers. When I started cooking, my only goal was to be fast. Aside from not working clean and generally spinning around in my head, I probably looked like I was having a seizure. Then I started to notice the other cooks around me that were better than me. They were so collec
ed...so expressionless. Did they just not care as much as me? Did they just not take things as seriously? Well, no. They just knew what they were doing. As my sous chef at that time said to me: "You don't want to look like a little bitch." Time passed on, and as I slowly came to find a comfortable place in my own skin, my movements became more relaxed, but my head didnt. I still felt like I was one step away from flipping over my cutting board, throwing my salt at the food runner, and fist and elbowing my way out of the front door. It would take lying to myself to cure it; daily affirmations of "You're on control, you can cook, you're a motherfucking handsome badass." It sounds ridiculous. It was. And it worked. Finding a way to be composed makes the other cooks look differently at you. The crew will respect you, your chef will be quietly impressed by you, and your skills will improve. You'll have more energy. And you'll know what to tell Mark when he starts to lose it. So how do you deal wih it? Where do you find your place of balance? How do you compose yourself when things get crazy? Notes : That G-Shock lasted a hard 10 years on my wrist. I washed it by putting it through the dishwasher. If the girl is more Ghost World than Mean Girls, it's probably a good thing. When someone says they did a "stint" in a kitchen, what the fuck does that mean? In order to truly find balance in life, I think a person really has to explore every single corner of the human experience before coming back to center. Ingrid writes some good stuff.

Here I sit, at the end of 2009, and it feels like everything is different.  None of the details have changed;  I still live in San Francisco, and I still cook at Nopa as a sous chef.  I'm still writing this blog.  But when I look in the mirror, or have a quiet moment to myself, things feel different.  2009 was a crazy year for me.  It was a good year for me.  In 2009 this blog seemed to find its place.  Through things that seem as trivial as a twitter account, or a podcast, I met people and made friendships that are deeply important to me.  Through countless emails I was able to connect with cooks from all over the world.  As everything seemed to be expanding and moving towards one big interpersonal disconnect, the opposite ended up happening.  My world got smaller.  Then I turned 30, and came to realize that I needed to take life a little more seriously.  Soul searching, introspection, whatever.  I made some decisions, and decided to stick to them.  Then I woke up one day, and wow.  Things had changed. 2010 is a little scary to think about.  A friend of mine said to me "2010 is the first year I haven't been excited about."  I had never thought about it like that, and im not sure that's my sentiment.  But it does feel like a giant, scary beast that I have to tackle...like im getting into the ring with a faceless terror.  In the following year im going to to be faced with figuring out whether im a better writer or a better cook.  There's a chance that this blog could end in 2010.  There isnt an infinite amount of topics for me to write about here.  Sometimes I feel like im just regurgitating the same old garbage.  Add to that the fact that im going to be a father, and want to open a restaurant this year, and things start to get very cloudy and scary and im suddenly very aware that nothing feels perfect or right, but things just are.  It's an amazing thing to be faced with the rest of your life.  I thought I knew what it would feel like, and how I would deal with it.  I don't.  And I suspect that's perfectly normal. The thing is, its not like anything is actually ending.  If anything, things are just beginning.  After a year like 2009, where things were so good and changed so much, I can only imagine what's coming.  It's possible that just being daunted about knowing that you have to make something for yourself is enough to leave you shaking...but maybe its better to try to run through all of the insecurity and bullshit now, before everyone is toasting at midnight. So whats next?  What's going to happen come July, or next December?  Shit, what's going to happen next week?  Does the fear or uncertainty ever go away?  Do things ever start to feel right, or perfect?  Or is it more important to just let things happen?

It's the easiest equation quality ingredients and a bit of care equal good results. swedishmike @ linecook Taking good ingredients and making them taste bad. It's a cold Tuesday night, and you're on a cook's night out; something your crew has looked forward to for days. The plan is to hit a string of new restaurants, eating as much as you can, then topping it all off with bourbon and shameful behavior. Rules are in place: no eating anywhere that anyone has been before. And no salads, pizza, or fancy renditions of mac n cheese. Things started out well enough. There were some tasty fried bits, the required offal dish, a polite terrine. But the in the past hour, things have taken a turn. There was raw fish paired with fried cheese. There was a risotto that was so rich and salty that your fish cook polished off the wine, straight from the bottle. And the lamb saddle was so over-techniqued that your best-of-friends hot apps cooks started screaming at each other over which part was the meat, and which was the marrow-wrapped tongue and kidney croquette. And it was cold. The night ends with you and the grill guy sitting on a stoop, having a smoke, wondering what happened. "Maybe they were having an off night..." "It's only their second month. Did you hear the chef de cuisine came from Mugaritz? Maybe they're just settling..." "Remember that case of nasty chicken bones we got last Wednesday? Maybe there's an epedemic of bad stocks sweeping the city..." "I saw that dude Damien in their kitchen. I hate that guy..." Bad food stays with you. It haunts you. You feel violated--your precious time and money wasted. It's made even worse when friends, or expectations are involved. And it's something that you are more likely to experience as the craft of cooking expands and evolves. But why? Is it as simple as a cook that doesn't care, or that isn't truly passionate about their craft? Of course. But I think in most cases it's something else completely. Bad cooking happens when things fall out of balance. Temperature. Tastes. Textures. A cook's focus. A cook's attitude. Have you ever eaten a meal with so much technique that the kitchen forgot about the actual taste? Have you ever had a meal so rustic you were left wondering if the kitchen was just slopping it out? Remember that night on the line where you were so focused on your meat temps that your veg was constantly scorched? Remember that night on the line when you were having so much fun that you kept forgetting to add that garnish you worked on for an hour? Balance is essential to good cooking--on every level, and in every position. It's the most difficult thing to achieve--and when it's happening, it's almost invisible. A cook's personality in general is not balanced. A group of people, given to such highs and lows, and dedicated only to pleasure and sensuality...where do you find balance in that? As cooks comes to know themselves, their awareness of balance slowly starts to reveal itself. They can feel the push and pull of their own emotions. Their heart swells and almost bursts when things are good, and shatters to pieces when things are bad--but they find a way to stay anchored in the middle, head down, with only a deep breath as evidence that they're feeling anything at all. Coercing their mind into this mental middle ground starts to translate into the pan, then onto the plate. The quiet balance in the cooks mind tells them when to hold back and when to push--be it with seasoning, speed, or technique. It's a mental high wire act that's exhausting, with far greater consequences. If you fall off the wire, you die. Big deal. If you cook bad food, you've lost guests and shamed your kitchen. You actually have to live with that. Some cooks never find balance--and that's ok with them. They produce food that they're happy with--and that the vast majority of diners would be happy to eat. But if the goal is to get better...to progress...to contribute, then isn't it important to find a sustainable method for mentally and physically producing your craft? If the goal is to be the best, and create great food, then isn't balance the most important ingredient? notes. sometimes indie music is indie because it completely sucks something I did not anticipate about losing weight: none of my clothes fitting anymore food inc. show it to someone that loves mc donalds. just when you think the tattoo is done, you
