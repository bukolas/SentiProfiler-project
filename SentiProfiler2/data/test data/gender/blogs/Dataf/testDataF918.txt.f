It was probably about four or five months ago when I applied for a job as a valet attendant, so this post has been long in the making, but it came up again yesterday afternoon when I was talking to some other students about workplace dress codes.

I was looking for some money on the side while I go to school, so I put in my application and was called in for an interview.  Everything was going great - I have a clean driving record and I drive a stick-shift, so I was feeling pretty good about it.  Then the interviewer got around to the dress code.  I would have to wear black pants, a plain white dress shirt, and... a tie.
I gave him an incredulous look and said, "I'm a woman."  He pointed out that he was wearing one and I told him, "Yeah, and it looks silly enough on a man, let alone on a woman."  Needless to say, I did not get the job.  I didn't want the job anymore and would have turned it down anyway.  I almost wanted to ask him if he would wear a skirt if that was the dress code... I wonder what he would have said.

This may have seemed a petty issue, but I feel that a dress code is being most sexist when it attempts to wipe away our sexual identities and make women emulate men.  If women should be forced to wear ties to earn a living, then why not make men wear heels?  I know for a fact that a woman in a skirt can be just as polite and can drive a car just as well as she could if she would wear pants, so what gives?  If they want sameness, they might as well get plastic surgery and melanin injections for their employees as well, just so they will all look exactly alike - don't stop at clothes!

The funny thing - this was at a Catholic hospital... and unless they don't hire any women, they are about 80% likely to end up with lesbians working there with this sort of a dress code.  Let's be realistic - if a man gets hired there, he probably already has a tie and white dress shirt, but a woman would have to go out and buy these things.  I can just imagine going to the men's section in JCPenney and getting fitted for a dress shirt, the guy standing there and trying to figure out what to do about my boobs...
